"12524994","Encrypt & Decrypt using PyCrypto AES 256","<p>I'm trying to build two functions using PyCrypto that accept two parameters: the message and the key, and then encrypt/decrypt the message.</p>

<p>Finally, what exactly is the IV? Can I provide a different IV for encrypting and decrypting, or will this return in a different result?</p>

","<p>You can get a passphrase out of an arbitrary password by using a cryptographic hash function (<em>NOT</em> Python's builtin <code>hash</code>) like SHA-1 or SHA-256. Python includes support for both in its standard library:</p>

<pre><code>import hashlib

hashlib.sha1(""this is my awesome password"").digest() # =&gt; a 20 byte string
hashlib.sha256(""another awesome password"").digest() # =&gt; a 32 byte string
</code></pre>

<p>You can truncate a cryptographic hash value just by using <code>[:16]</code> or <code>[:24]</code> and it will retain its security up to the length you specify.</p>

","<p>You may need the following two functions to pad(when do encryption) and unpad(when do decryption) when the length of input is not a multiple of BLOCK_SIZE.</p>

<pre><code>BS = 16
pad = lambda s: s + (BS - len(s) % BS) * chr(BS - len(s) % BS) 
unpad = lambda s : s[:-ord(s[len(s)-1:])]
</code></pre>

<p>So you're asking the length of key? You can use the md5sum of the key rather than use it directly.</p>

<p>More, according to my little experience of using PyCrypto, the IV is used to mix up the output of a encryption when input is same, so the IV is chosen as a random string, and use it as part of the encryption output, and then use it to decrypt the message.</p>

<p>And here's my implementation, hope it will be useful for you:</p>

class AESCipher:
    def __init__( self, key ):
        self.key = key

","<p>Let me address your question about ""modes."" AES256 is a kind of <strong>block cipher</strong>. It takes as input a 32-byte <strong>key</strong> and a 16-byte string, called the <strong>block</strong> and outputs a block. We use AES in a <strong>mode of operation</strong> in order to encrypt. The solutions above suggest using CBC, which is one example. Another is called CTR, and it's somewhat easier to use:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util import Counter
from Crypto import Random

# AES supports multiple key sizes: 16 (AES128), 24 (AES192), or 32 (AES256).
key_bytes = 32

# Takes as input a 32-byte key and an arbitrary-length plaintext and returns a
# pair (iv, ciphtertext). ""iv"" stands for initialization vector.
def encrypt(key, plaintext):
    assert len(key) == key_bytes

    # Choose a random, 16-byte IV.
    iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)

    # Convert the IV to a Python integer.
    iv_int = int(binascii.hexlify(iv), 16) 

    # Create a new Counter object with IV = iv_int.
    ctr = Counter.new(AES.block_size * 8, initial_value=iv_int)

    # Create AES-CTR cipher.
    aes = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr)

    # Encrypt and return IV and ciphertext.
    ciphertext = aes.encrypt(plaintext)
    return (iv, ciphertext)

# Takes as input a 32-byte key, a 16-byte IV, and a ciphertext, and outputs the
# corresponding plaintext.
def decrypt(key, iv, ciphertext):
    assert len(key) == key_bytes

    # Initialize counter for decryption. iv should be the same as the output of
    # encrypt().
    iv_int = int(iv.encode('hex'), 16) 
    ctr = Counter.new(AES.block_size * 8, initial_value=iv_int)

    # Create AES-CTR cipher.
    aes = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr)

    # Decrypt and return the plaintext.
    plaintext = aes.decrypt(ciphertext)
    return plaintext

(iv, ciphertext) = encrypt(key, 'hella')
print decrypt(key, iv, ciphertext)
</code></pre>

<p>This is often referred to as AES-CTR. <strong>I would advise caution in using AES-CBC with PyCrypto</strong>. The reason is that it requires you to specify the <strong>padding scheme</strong>, as exemplified by the other solutions given. In general, if you're not <strong>very</strong> careful about the padding, <strong>there are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack"" rel=""noreferrer"">attacks</a> that completely break encryption!</strong> </p>

<p>Now, it's important to note that the key must be a <strong>random, 32-byte string</strong>; a password <strong>does not</strong> suffice. Normally, the key is generated like so:</p>

<pre><code># Nominal way to generate a fresh key. This calls the system's random number
# generator (RNG).
key1 = Random.new().read(key_bytes)
</code></pre>

<p>A key may be <strong>derived from a password</strong>, too:</p>

<pre><code># It's also possible to derive a key from a password, but it's important that
# the password have high entropy, meaning difficult to predict.
password = ""This is a rather weak password.""

# For added # security, we add a ""salt"", which increases the entropy.
#
# In this example, we use the same RNG to produce the salt that we used to
# produce key1.
salt_bytes = 8 
salt = Random.new().read(salt_bytes)

# Stands for ""Password-based key derivation function 2""
key2 = PBKDF2(password, salt, key_bytes)
</code></pre>

<p>Some solutions above suggest using SHA256 for deriving the key, but this is generally considered <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function#Password_verification"" rel=""noreferrer"">bad cryptographic practice</a>.

<blockquote>
  <p>Pycrypto is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the ALGnew function in block_templace.c. It allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the python application. It was assigned the <a href=""https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7459"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CVE-2013-7459</a> number.</p>
  
  <p>Pycrypto didn’t release any fix to that vulnerability and no commit was made to the project since Jun 20, 2014.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>SOLUTION: Use Python3 and <code>pycryptodome</code>!</h1>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> <code>pip3 install pycryptodome</code></p>

<h3>Setting up a new virtual environment</h3>

<p>To install a virtual environment and setup everything, use the following commands:</p>

<pre><code># install python3 and pip3
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip

# install and create a virtual environment
# cd to or mkdir the folder where you want your venv
pip3 install virtualenv
python3 -m virtualenv .

# now activate your venv and install pycryptodome
source bin/activate
pip3 install pycryptodome

# check if everything worked: 
# start the interactive python console and import the Crypto module
# when there is no import error then it worked
python
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Crypto.Cipher import AES
&gt;&gt;&gt; exit()

# don't forget to deactivate your venv again
deactivate

","<h3>In general</h3>

<p><code>vcvarsall.bat</code> is part of the Visual C++ compiler, you need that to install what you are trying to install. Don't even try to deal with MingGW if your Python was compiled with Visual Studio toolchain and vice versa. Even the <strong>version</strong> of the Microsoft tool chain is important. Python compiled with VS 2008 won't work with extensions compiled with VS 2010!</p>

<p>You have to compile PyCrypto with the same compiler that the version of Python was compiled with. Google for <em>""Unable to find vcvarsall.bat""</em> because that is the root of your problem, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2817869/error-unable-to-find-vcvarsall-bat"">it is a very common problem with compiling Python extensions on Windows.</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20101221084639/http://nukeit.org/compile-python-2-7-packages-with-visual-studio-2010-express/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">There is a lot of information and a lot to read to get this right on whatever system you are on with this link.</a> </p>

<h3>Beware using Visual Studio 2010 or not using Visual Studio 2008</h3>

<p>As far as I know the following is still true. This was posted in the link above in June, 2010 referring to trying to build extensions with VS 2010 Express against the Python installers available on python.org.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Be careful if you do this. Python 2.6 and 2.7 from python.org are
  built with Visual Studio 2008 compilers. You will need to link with
  the same CRT (msvcr90.dll) as Python.</p>
  
  <p>Visual Studio 2010 Express links with the wrong CRT version:
  msvcr100.dll.</p>
  
  <p>If you do this, you must also re-build Python with Visual Studio 2010
  Express. You cannot use the standard Python binary installer for
  Windows. Nor can you use any C/C++ extensions built with a different
  compiler than Visual Studio 2010 (Express).</p>

","<p>It's possible to build PyCrypto using the Windows 7 SDK toolkits. There are two versions of the Windows 7 SDK. The original version (for .Net 3.5) includes the VS 2008 command-line compilers. Both 32- and 64-bit compilers can be installed.</p>

<p>The first step is to compile <a href=""http://mpir.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">mpir</a> to provide fast arithmetic. I've documented the process I use in the <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/gmpy/"" rel=""nofollow"">gmpy</a> library. Detailed instructions for building mpir using the SDK compiler can be found at <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/gmpy/source/browse/trunk/win_x64_sdk_build.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">sdk_build</a></p>

<p>The key steps to use the SDK compilers from a DOS prompt are:</p>

<p>1) Run either vcvars32.bat or vcvars64.bat as appropriate.</p>

<p>2) At the prompt, execute ""set MSSdk=1""</p>

<p>3) At the prompt, execute ""set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1""</p>

<p>This should allow ""python setup.py install"" to succeed assuming there are no other issues  with the C code. But I vaaguely remember that I had to edit a couple of PyCrypto files to enable mpir and to find the mpir libraries but I don't have my Windows system up at the moment. It will be a couple of days before I'll have time to recreate the steps. If you haven't reported success by then, I'll post the PyCrypto steps. The steps will assume you were able to compile mpir.</p>

<p>I hope this helps. </p>

","<p>I have managed to get <code>pycrypto</code> to compile by using <code>MinGW32</code> and <code>MSYS</code>. This presumes that you have <code>pip</code> or <code>easy_install</code> installed.</p>

<p>Here's how I did it:</p>

<p>1) Install <a href=""http://www.mingw.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MinGW32</a>. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume it's installed in <code>C:\MinGW</code>. When using the installer, which I recommend, select the C++ compiler<code>.</code>  MSYS should install with <code>MinGW</code></p>

<p>2) Add <code>c:\mingw\bin,c:\mingw\mingw32\bin,C:\MinGW\msys\1.0, c:\mingw\msys\1.0\bin and c:\mingw\msys\1.0\sbin</code> to your <code>%PATH%</code>. If you aren't familiar, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6318156/adding-python-path-on-windows-7"">this article</a> is very helpful.</p>

<p>3) From the search bar, run <code>msys</code> and the MSYS terminal will open. For those familiar with <code>Cygwin</code>, it works in a similar fashion.</p>

<p>4) From within the MSYS terminal <code>pip install pycrypto</code> should run without error after this.  </p>

<p>This error <code>""RuntimeError: chmod error""</code> occurs because the install script didn't find the <code>chmod</code> command.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>You only need to <strong>add the MSYS binaries to the PATH and re-run the install script</strong>.</p>

<p>(N.B: Note that MinGW comes with MSYS so )</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>For example, if we are in folder <code>C:\&lt;..&gt;\pycrypto-2.6.1\dist\pycrypto-2.6.1&gt;</code></p>

<p><code>C:\.....&gt;</code><strong><code>set PATH=C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin;%PATH%</code></strong><br/>
<code>C:\.....&gt;</code><strong><code>python setup.py install</code></strong></p>

<p>Optional: you might need to clean before you re-run the script:</p>

<pre><code>`C:\&lt;..&gt;\pycrypto-2.6.1\dist\pycrypto-2.6.1&gt; python setup.py clean`

","<p><strong>After years and years</strong>, python finally agreed for a binary disribution called <code>wheel</code> which allows to install even binary extensions on Windows without having a compiler with simple <code>pip install packagename</code>.

","<p>I know this is a bit late but <a href=""http://joelinoff.com/blog/?p=885"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> is a solution that I blogged in 2013 about how to use the python pycrypto package to encrypt/decrypt in an openssl compatible way. It has been tested on python2.7 and python3.x. The source code and a test script can be found <a href=""https://gist.github.com/jlinoff/412752f1ecb6b27762539c0f6b6d667b"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>One of the key differences between this solution and the excellent solutions presented above is that it differentiates between pipe and file I/O which can cause problems in some applications.</p>

","<h1>Note: this method is not OpenSSL compatible</h1>

<p>But it is suitable if all you want to do is encrypt and decrypt files.</p>

<p>A self-answer I copied from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45358388/import-encrypted-csv-into-python-3?noredirect=1#comment77729445_45358388"">here</a>. I think this is, perhaps, a simpler and more secure option. Although I would be interested in some expert opinion on how secure it is.</p>

<p>I used Python 3.6 and <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simple-crypt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SimpleCrypt</a> to encrypt the file and then uploaded it. </p>

<p>I <em>think</em> this is the code I used to encrypt the file:</p>

<pre><code>from simplecrypt import encrypt, decrypt
f = open('file.csv','r').read()
ciphertext = encrypt('USERPASSWORD',f.encode('utf8')) # I am not certain of whether I used the .encode('utf8')
e = open('file.enc','wb') # file.enc doesn't need to exist, python will create it
e.write(ciphertext)
e.close
</code></pre>

<p>This is the code I use to decrypt at runtime, I run <code>getpass(""password: "")</code> as an argument so I don't have to store a <code>password</code> variable in memory</p>

<pre><code>from simplecrypt import encrypt, decrypt
from getpass import getpass

# opens the file
f = open('file.enc','rb').read()

print('Please enter the password and press the enter key \n Decryption may take some time')

# Decrypts the data, requires a user-input password
plaintext = decrypt(getpass(""password: ""), f).decode('utf8')
print('Data have been Decrypted')
</code></pre>

<p>Note, the UTF-8 encoding behaviour is different in python 2.7 so the code will be slightly different.</p>

<p>missed this file: <strong>'openssl/opensslv.h'</strong></p>

<p>it will be happens because while installation paramiko/cryptography/pyOpenSSL packages, they all needed distribution package of <strong>OpenSSL-Win32</strong> with <strong>*.lib</strong> and headers files like: <strong>openssl\opensslv.h</strong></p>

<p>so, after installation appropriate OpenSSL app. version, took from here:

","<p>You need to install Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 to install pycrypto:</p>

<pre><code>error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required. Get it with ""Microsoft Visual
C++ Build Tools"": http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools
</code></pre>

<p>In the comments you ask which link to use. Use the link to <a href=""http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691126&amp;fixForIE=.exe."" rel=""noreferrer"">Visual C++ 2015 Build Tools</a>. That will install Visual C++ 14.0 without installing Visual Studio.</p>

<p>In the comments you ask about methods of installing <code>pycrypto</code> that do not require installing a compiler. The binaries in the links appear to be for earlier versions of Python than you are using. One link is to a binary in a DropBox account.</p>

<p>I do not recommend downloading binary versions of cryptography libraries provided by third parties. The only way to guarantee that you are getting a version of <code>pycrypto</code> that is compatible with your version of Python and has not been built with any backdoors is to build it from the source.</p>

<p>After you have installed Visual C++, just re-run the original command:</p>

<pre><code>pip install -U steem
</code></pre>

<p>To find out what the various install options mean, run this command:</p>

<pre><code>pip help install
</code></pre>

<p>The help for the <code>-U</code> option says</p>

<pre><code>-U, --upgrade        Upgrade all specified packages to the newest available
                     version. The handling of dependencies depends on the
                     upgrade-strategy used.
</code></pre>

<p>If you do not already have the <code>steem</code> library installed, you can run the command without the <code>-U</code> option.</p>

"44951456","Pip error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required","<p>I just ran the ""pip install -U steem""-command and the installation worked well until it failed to install pycrypto. 
Afterwards I did the ""pip install cryptography"" command because I thought it was the missing package. 
So my question is, how I can install steem without the pycrypto-error (or the pycrypto-package in addition) and how to deinstall the cryptography-Package which I don't need. 
(I'm using Windows 7 and Python 3)</p>

","<p>I got this error when I tried to install pymssql even though Visual C++ 2015 (14.0) is installed in my system.</p>

<p>I resolved this error by downloading the .whl file of pymssql from <a href=""https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/</a></p>

<p>Once downloaded, it can be installed by the following command :</p>

<pre><code>pip install python_package.whl
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps</p>

Afterwards I did the ""pip install cryptography"" command because I thought it was the missing package. 
So my question is, how I can install steem without the pycrypto-error (or the pycrypto-package in addition) and how to deinstall the cryptography-Package which I don't need. 
(I'm using Windows 7 and Python 3)</p>

","<p>On Windows, I strongly recommand installing latest <code>Visual Stuido Community</code>, it's free, you will maybe miss some build tools if you only install <code>vc_redist</code>, so you can easily install package by <code>pip</code> instead of <code>wheel</code>, it save lot of time</p>

Afterwards I did the ""pip install cryptography"" command because I thought it was the missing package. 
So my question is, how I can install steem without the pycrypto-error (or the pycrypto-package in addition) and how to deinstall the cryptography-Package which I don't need. 
(I'm using Windows 7 and Python 3)</p>

","<p>If you already have Visual Studio Build Tools installed but you're still getting that error, then you may need to ""Modify"" your installation to include the Visual C++ build tools.</p>

<p>To do that:</p>

<li><p>Open up the Visual Studio Installer (you can search for it in the Start Menu if needed).</p></li>
<li><p>Find Visual Studio Build Tools and click ""Modify"":</p></li>

Afterwards I did the ""pip install cryptography"" command because I thought it was the missing package. 
So my question is, how I can install steem without the pycrypto-error (or the pycrypto-package in addition) and how to deinstall the cryptography-Package which I don't need.

","<p>I faced the same problem. Found the fix here.
<a href=""https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/issues/4160"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/issues/4160</a></p>

<p>Basically just install</p>

<p>shasum output:</p>

md5sum output:</p>

<p>MD5 (visualcppbuildtools_full.exe) = 8d4afd3b226babecaa4effb10d69eb2e</p>

<p>Run your pip installation command again. If everything works fine, its good. Or you might face the following error like me:</p>

<pre><code>Finished generating code
    LINK : fatal error LNK1158: cannot run 'rc.exe'
    error: command 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\\VC\\BIN\\x86_amd64\\link.exe' failed with exit status 1158
</code></pre>

<p>Found the fix for the above problem here:
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14372706/visual-studio-cant-build-due-to-rc-exe"">Visual Studio can&#39;t build due to rc.exe</a></p>

<p>That basically says</p>

<pre><code>Add this to your PATH environment variables:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\bin\x86

Copy these files:

rc.exe
rcdll.dll

From

C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\bin\x86

To

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\VC\bin
</code></pre>

<p>It works like a charm</p>

Afterwards I did the ""pip install cryptography"" command because I thought it was the missing package. 
So my question is, how I can install steem without the pycrypto-error (or the pycrypto-package in addition) and how to deinstall the cryptography-Package which I don't need.

","<p>That warning shouldn't stop the build, more likely you are lacking the Visual Studio 2015 compiler which is necessary to build binary extensions (which PyCrypto has). See the <a href=""https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/extensions/#building-binary-extensions"" rel=""noreferrer"">Python Packaging User Guide</a> for which compiler you need for your version of Python.</p>

<p>The reason you need the compiler is PyCrypto only offers a Source Distribution officially. So, you have two options for installing PyCrypto:</p>

<h1>1. Build from source:</h1>

<p>This is actually fairly simple, but it requires that you install some extra software. Again, refer to the Python Packaging User Guide linked above to find the suitable compiler for your version of Python. I think that there is an option to only install the relevant compiler for Python if you do a custom install of Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Then, after the installation is completed, and you probably had to restart your computer, you should be able to simply run <code>pip install pycrypto</code> and pip will download the source and compile it for you.</p>

<p>If you also installed wheel (<code>pip install wheel</code>) then pip will create a wheel from the source and cache it, which is how I created the wheels that I'm sharing in option 2.</p>

<h1>2. Install a Built Distribution from a 3rd party</h1>

<p>I happen to be a 3rd party and have shared wheels I compiled for PyCrypto 2.6.1 w/ Python 3.5 for 32 and 64-bit Windows <a href=""https://github.com/sfbahr/PyCrypto-Wheels"" rel=""noreferrer"">on my GitHub repo</a>. I included installation instructions on the readme of that repo.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a built distribution for an older version of Python and/or PyCrypto, I've also linked to Voidspace on my repo's readme (sorry, I'm limited to 2 links here).</p>

","<p><code>AES.new().encrypt()</code> and <code>.decrypt()</code> take as both input and output strings whose length is a multiple of 16.  You have to fix it in one way or another.  For example you can store the real length at the start, and use that to truncate the decrypted string.</p>

<p>Note also that while it's the only restriction for AES, other modules (notably in <code>Crypto.PublicKey</code>) have additional restrictions that comes from their mathematical implementation and that shouldn't (in my opinion) be visible to the end user, but are.  For example <code>Crypto.PublicKey.ElGamal</code> will encrypt any short string, but if it starts with null characters, they are lost upon decryption.</p>

","<p>To be honest, the characters <em>""\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n""</em> don't look that random to me. ;-)</p>

<p>You are using AES in CBC mode. That requires length of plaintext and ciphertext to be always a multiple of 16 bytes. With the code you show, you should actually see an exception being raised when <code>data</code> passed to <code>encrypt()</code> does not fulfill such condition. It looks like you added enough new line characters (<em>'\n'</em> to whatever the input is until the plaintext happened to be aligned.</p>

<p>Apart from that, there are two common ways to solve the alignment issue:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Switch from CBC (<code>AES.MODE_CBC</code>) to CFB (<code>AES.MODE_CFB</code>). With the default <code>segment_size</code> used by PyCrypto, you will not have any restriction on plaintext and ciphertext lengths.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep CBC and use a padding scheme like PKCS#7, that is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>before encrypting a plaintext of <code>X</code> bytes, append to the back as many bytes you need to to reach the next 16 byte boundary. All padding bytes have the same value: the number of bytes that you are adding:</p>

<pre><code>length = 16 - (len(data) % 16)
data += bytes([length])*length
</code></pre>

<p>That's Python 3 style. In Python 2, you would have:</p>

<pre><code>length = 16 - (len(data) % 16)
data += chr(length)*length
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>after decrypting, remove from the back of the plaintext as many bytes as indicated by padding:</p>

<pre><code>data = data[:-data[-1]]
</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Even though I understand in your case it is just a class exercise, I would like to point out that it is insecure to send data without any form of authentication (e.g. a MAC).</p>

<p>you should not use Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.sign function from PyCrypto in real code:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Attention: this function performs the plain, primitive RSA decryption (textbook). In real applications, you always need to use proper cryptographic padding, and you should not directly sign data with this method. Failure to do so may lead to security vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use modules Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_PSS or Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_v1_5 instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I ended up using the <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rsa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RSA module</a> that implements PKCS1_v1_5. The <a href=""http://stuvel.eu/files/python-rsa-doc/usage.html#signing-and-verification"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation for signing</a> was pretty straight forward.

","<p>In Python 3 (which you are clearly using) the default mode for files you open is text, not binary. When you read from the file, you get strings rather than byte arrays. That does not go along with encryption.</p>

","<p>I took a closer look at your code, and saw that there were several problems with it. First one is that the crypto functions with with bytes, not text. So it's better to just keep the data as a byte string. This is done simply by putting a 'b' character in the mode.  This way you can get rid of all the encoding and bytes conversion you were trying to do.  </p>

"19548800","Decrypt using an RSA public key with PyCrypto","<p>As far as I understand, I should be able to use RSA to ensure authenticity or privacy, as I wish. In my case, I want to ensure authenticity so I encrypt the data with the private key and allow anyone to decrypt it with the public key. The data is not really secret but I need to guarantee that it was created by the owner of the public (and private) key.</p>

<p>When I try to decrypt using PyCrypto I get <strong>No private key</strong> error from PyCrypto. The code is this:</p>

<pre><code>def _decrypt_rsa(decrypt_key_file, cipher_text):
    from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
    from base64 import b64decode

    key = open(decrypt_key_file, ""r"").read()
    rsakey = RSA.importKey(key)
    raw_cipher_data = b64decode(cipher_text)
    decrypted = rsakey.decrypt(raw_cipher_data)
    return decrypted

<p>I'm calling it with the path to the public key file (in OpenSSH format.) The encrypted data isn't generated by me and it was not done with Python but PHP. In PHP there's a <code>openssl_public_decrypt</code> function that decrypts this data easily.</p>

<p>Is it possible at all to decrypt using the public key with PyCrypto? </p>
","<p>That is totally insecure, because you are using raw RSA without padding.</p>

<p>Your application needs a signature, so you should not be dealing with encryptions and decryptions. For instance, PKCS#1 v1.5 is a good protocol, even though the signature is a piece of data that must be appended to what you want to prove the authenticity of.</p>

<p>To verify a PKCS#1 v1.5 signature in Python, you do:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Signature import PKCS1_v1_5
from Crypto.Hash import SHA

rsa_key = RSA.importKey(open(verification_key_file, ""rb"").read())
verifier = PKCS1_v1_5.new(rsa_key)
h = SHA.new(data_to_verify)
if verifier.verify(h, signature_received_with_the_data):
    print ""OK""
else:
    print ""Invalid""
</code></pre>

<p>I would strongly recommend to change the PHP code so that it creates such a signature.</p>

<p>Importing the public key works fine, however it is not encrypted.</p>
","<p><strong>Hypothesis #1</strong></p>

<p>After looking to the source code, I think, I solved the mystery. The way how import works for PEM keys encrypted with a password is that the PEM gets decrypted to DER and after that importKeyDER function is called. If provided password is not correct, the format of generated DER representation will not be correct too and you would get an exception that you've provided. To confirm that, I ran two quick tests below:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = open('&lt;some-path&gt;/private-key.pem','r')
&gt;&gt;&gt; r=RSA.importKey(f.read(),passphrase='foo')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Crypto/PublicKey/RSA.py"", line 665, in importKey
    return self._importKeyDER(der)
  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Crypto/PublicKey/RSA.py"", line 588, in    _importKeyDER
    raise ValueError(""RSA key format is not supported"")
ValueError: RSA key format is not supported
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = open('&lt;some-path&gt;/private-key.pem','r')
&gt;&gt;&gt; r=RSA.importKey(f.read(),passphrase='&lt;valid-pass-phrase&gt;')
&gt;&gt;&gt; r
&lt;_RSAobj @0xb7237b2c n(4096),e,d,p,q,u,private&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After receiving the PEM from the author, I've realized that Hypothesis #1 is not valid for his case. I still want to keep it here as one possible reason of import failure, so other users are aware.</p>

<p><strong>Hypothesis #2</strong> - this is the author's case.</p>

<p>RSA.py looks for the following in PEM file to determine what kind of encryption was applied to PEM:</p>

<pre><code> Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED
</code></pre>

<p>When key is generated using ""openssl genrsa ..."" command, this string is present in PEM in clear, however when ""opensl genpkey ..."" is used the ""Proc-Type"" is not present.</p>

<p>RSA.py doesn't even try to decrypt the PEM if the ""Proc-Type"" is not found:</p>

<pre><code>  # The encrypted PEM format
  if lines[1].startswith(b('Proc-Type:4,ENCRYPTED')):
     DEK = lines[2].split(b(':'))
     ....
</code></pre>

<p>So, my conclusion at this time is that keys generated by ""openssl genpkey"" are not supported by PyCrypto v 2.6.1.</p>

","<p>A quick update for those who seek to solve this problem without installing an experimental release of long-abandoned PyCrypto. The library can be safely replaced by pycryptodome (<a href=""https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome</a>) - it can provide both a drop-in replacement for pycrypto, and it can be used as an alternative library as well (pycryptodomex).</p>

"3920502","How to suppress a third-party warning using warnings.filterwarnings","<p>I am using Paramiko in my python code (for sftp). Everything works fine except that everytime I import or call a paramiko function. This warning would show up:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\Crypto\Util\randpool.py:40: RandomPool_Deprecation
Warning: This application uses RandomPool, which is BROKEN in older releases.  S
ee http://www.pycrypto.org/randpool-broken
  RandomPool_DeprecationWarning)
</code></pre>

<p>I know that this has to do with the fact that Paramiko is using some Deprecated functionalities of PyCrypto. </p>

<p>My question is, is there a way to suppress this warning programmatically ?
I have tried this:</p>

<pre><code>warnings.filterwarnings(action='ignore', \
category=DeprecationWarning, module='paramiko')
</code></pre>

<p>and even this:</p>

<pre><code>warnings.filterwarnings(action='ignore', \
category=DeprecationWarning, module='randpool')
</code></pre>

<p>before 'import paramiko' statement and before paramiko-specific function calls, but nothing works. This warning keeps showing up no matter what.
If it helps, here's the code in the third party library that prints the warning:</p>

<p>in randpool.py:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.pct_warnings import RandomPool_DeprecationWarning
import Crypto.Random
import warnings

class RandomPool:
    """"""Deprecated.  Use Random.new() instead.

    See http://www.pycrypto.org/randpool-broken

            RandomPool_DeprecationWarning)
</code></pre>

<p>If you know a way around this, please help me shut this warning off.</p>
","<p>The <code>module</code> argument to <code>warnings.filterwarnings</code> takes a case-sensitive regular expression which should match the fully qualified module name, so </p>

<pre><code>warnings.filterwarnings(
    action='ignore',
    category=DeprecationWarning,
    module=r'.*randpool'
)
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>warnings.filterwarnings(
    action='ignore',
    category=DeprecationWarning,
    module=r'Crypto\.Utils\.randpool'
)
</code></pre>

<p>should work. You may need to write <code>RandomPool_DeprecationWarning</code> explicitly instead of <code>DeprecationWarning</code> if for some reason <code>RandomPool_DeprecationWarning</code> is not a subclass of <code>DeprecationWarning</code>.</p>

<p>You can also disable the warning on the command line when you invoke the script by passing the <code>-W</code> option to the interpreter like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ python -W ignore::RandomPool_DeprecationWarning:Crypto.Utils.randpool: my_script.py
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>-W</code> takes filters in the format <code>action:message:category:module:lineno</code>, where this time <code>module</code> must exactly match the (fully-qualified) module name where the warning is raised.</p>

","<p>Did a bit of research for you, and here's the bug that was filed for the SDK:
<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=2493"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=2493</a></p>

<p>Summary of the issue:
GAE has a customized version of PyCrypto 2.0.1 installed. Docs can be found <a href=""http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries.html#PyCrypto"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>SDK does not include the PyCrypto implementation from GAE, so it needs to be installed locally. However, the default path for installation is blocked by the SDK. Solution recommended in the bug comments is to install PyCrypto in each app's directory. Steps are outlined in the bug comments (not trivial).</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

","<p>I finally realized that the root of my problem was in an incompatibility between the versions of Fabric and Pycrypto.  Once I downgraded my version of Fabric to 1.2.6, I no longer got the errors above.  Then, I used the <a href=""http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.6/installation.html#pycrypto"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tutorial</a> as a jumping off point.  However, despite the tutorial and the older version of Fabric, I still got the <code>PyCrypto &gt;= 2.1, !=2.4</code> error.  I eventually installed Pycrypto 2.2 from source (since apparently <code>pip</code> will only install v. 2.0.1 even when designating <code>pip -Iv install pycrypto==2.2</code> per <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5226311/installing-specific-package-versions-with-pip"">this</a> and v. 2.6 resulted in the <code>gmp.h</code> error).  Finally, everything worked.</p>

<p>I'm running Mac 10.8.2, python 2.7.3 via Homebrew, and XCode 4.6 -- installing with pip or easy_install (I've tried both).

","<p>Just want to add info about mods of operations</p>

<p>Yes, AES is a 128-bit (16-byte) block cipher with multiple possible key length (128, 192, 256), but the cause of this text padding limitation (and error msg) is ECB <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation"" rel=""nofollow"">mode of operation</a>. ECB is the simplest of the encryption modes. I don't know your goals, so will just skip the part that <strong>it doesn't provide serious message confidentiality</strong>.</p>

<p>CBC and CTR are more common and usually appropriate to use and in CTR mode you don't need 128-bit message length.</p>

<p>There is also <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext_stealing"" rel=""nofollow"">ciphertext stealing (CTS)</a> method for ECB and CBC modes. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Method of using a block cipher mode of operation that allows for
  processing of messages that are not evenly divisible into blocks
  without resulting in any expansion of the ciphertext, at the cost of
  slightly increased complexity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Ciphertext stealing for ECB mode requires the plaintext to be longer than one 128-bit block.</p>

","<p>In Python, it is perfectly valid to treat functions as objects. It is also perfectly valid to treat any object that defines <code>__call__(self, ...)</code> as a function.</p>

<p>So what you want might something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class IVCounter(object):
    def __init__(self, start=1L):
        self.value = long(start)
    def __call__(self):
        self.value += 1L

ctr = IVCounter()
... make some keys and ciphertext ...
print AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr).decrypt(ciphertext)
</code></pre>

<p>However, PyCrypto provides a counter method for you that should be much faster than pure Python:</p>

<pre><code>import Crypto.Util.Counter
ctr = Crypto.Util.Counter.new(NUM_COUNTER_BITS)

<p><code>ctr</code> is now a stateful function (and, simultaneously, a callable object) that increments and returns its internal state every time you call it. You can then do </p>

<pre><code>print AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr).decrypt(ciphertext)

<p>just as before.</p>

<p>Here's a working example using Crypto.Cipher.AES in CTR mode with a user-specified initialization vector:</p>

<pre><code>import Crypto.Cipher.AES

key = ""0123456789ABCDEF"" # replace this with a sensible value, preferably the output of a hash
iv = ""0000000000009001"" # replace this with a RANDOMLY GENERATED VALUE, and send this with the ciphertext!

plaintext = ""Attack at dawn"" # replace with your actual plaintext

ctr = Crypto.Util.Counter.new(128, initial_value=long(iv.encode(""hex""), 16))

cipher = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, Crypto.Cipher.AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr)
print cipher.encrypt(plaintext)

","<p>The developer for PyCrypto pulled the specification for AES CBC Mode from NIST:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.Cipher.blockalgo-module.html#MODE_CBC"" rel=""nofollow"">AES Mode_CBC</a> -> referencing <a href=""http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-38a/sp800-38a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">NIST 800-38a (The Recommendation for Cipher Mode Operations)</a></p>

<p>From that, page 8:</p>

<p>5.3  Initialization Vectors</p>

<p>The input to the encryption processes of the CBC, CFB, and OFB modes includes, in addition to the plaintext, a data block called the initialization vector (IV), denoted IV. The IV is used in an initial step in the encryption of a message and in the corresponding decryption of the message. 
The IV need not be secret; however, for the CBC and CFB modes, the IV for any particular 
execution of the encryption process must be unpredictable, and, for the OFB mode, <strong>unique IVs must be used for each execution of the encryption process</strong>.  The generation of IVs is discussed in Appendix C. </p>

<hr>

<p>Thing to remember, you need to use a random IV every time you compose a message, this adds a 'salt' to the message therefore making the message unique; even with the 'salt' being out in the open, it will not help break the encryption if the AES encryption key is <strong>unknown</strong>.  If you do not use a randomized IV, say, you use the same 16 bytes each message, your messages, if you repeat yourself, will look the same going across the wire and you could be subject to frequency and/or replay attacks.</p>

<p>A test for the results of random IVs vs static:</p>

<pre><code>def test_crypto ():
    print(""Same IVs same key:"")
    key = generate_aes_key()
    iv = b""1234567890123456""
    msg = b""This is some super secret message.  Please don't tell anyone about it or I'll have to shoot you.""
    code = encrypt(key, iv, msg)
    print(code.encode('hex'))
    decoded = decrypt(key, iv, code)
    print(decoded)

    code = encrypt(key, iv, msg)
    print(code.encode('hex'))
    decoded = decrypt(key, iv, code)
    print(decoded)

    print(""Different IVs same key:"")
    iv = generate_aes_key()

","<p>The behavior you see is specific to the CBC mode. With CBC, decryption can be visualized in the following way (from wikipedia):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/P0TAV.png"" alt=""CBC decryption""></p>

<p>You can see that IV only contributes to the first 16 bytes of plaintext. If the IV is corrupted while it is in transit to the receiver, CBC will still correctly decrypt all blocks but the first one. In CBC, the purpose of the IV is to enable you to encrypt the same message with the same key, and still get a totally different ciphertext each time (even though the message length may give something away).</p>

<p>Other modes are less forgiving. If you get the IV wrong, the whole message is garbled at decryption. Take CTR mode for instance, where <em>nonce</em> takes almost the same meaning of <em>IV</em>:</p>

","<p>You should be overriding <code>to_python</code>, like the snippet did.</p>

<p>If you take a look at the <code>CharField</code> class you can see that it doesn't have a <code>value_to_string</code> method:</p>

<li><a href=""https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/models/fields/__init__.py#L621"" rel=""nofollow""><code>django/db/models/fields/__init__.py</code></a></li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/custom-model-fields/#django.db.models.Field.to_python"" rel=""nofollow"">docs</a> say that the <code>to_python</code> method needs to deal with three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>An instance of the correct type</li>
<li>A string (e.g., from a deserializer). </li>
<li>Whatever the database returns for the column type you're using.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are currently only dealing with the third case.</p>

<p>One way to handle this is to create a special class for a decrypted string:</p>

<pre><code>class DecryptedString(str):
   pass
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can detect this class and handle it in <code>to_python()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def to_python(self, value):

        return value

    decrypted = self.encrypter.decrypt(encrypted)

<p>By the way:</p>

<p>Instead of <code>get_db_prep_value</code> you should use <code>get_prep_value</code> (the former is for db specific conversions - see <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/howto/custom-model-fields/#converting-python-objects-to-query-values"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/howto/custom-model-fields/#converting-python-objects-to-query-values</a> )</p>

<p>When saving a model, an error, Odd-length string, occurs, as a result of attempting to decrypt an already decrypted string.  When debugging, it appears as  to_python ends up being called twice, the first with the encrypted value, and the second time with the decrypted value, but not actually as a type Decrypted, but as a raw string, causing the error.  Furthermore get_prep_value is never called.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>This should not be that hard - does anyone else think this Django field code is very poorly written, especially when it comes to custom fields, and not that extensible?  Simple overridable pre_save and post_fetch methods would easily solve this problem.</p>
","<p>I think the issue is that to_python is also called when you assign a value to your custom field (as part of validation may be, based on <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/forms/validation/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this link</a>). So the problem is to distinguish between to_python calls in the following situations:</p>

<ol>
<li>When a value from the database is assigned to the field by Django (That's when you want to decrypt the value)</li>
<li>When you manually assign a value to the custom field, e.g. record.field = value</li>
</ol>

<p>One hack you could use is to add prefix or suffix to the value string and check for that instead of doing <em>isinstance</em> check. </p>

<p>I was going to write an example, but I found this one (even better :)).</p>

","<p>Since this question was originally answered, a number of packages have been written to solve this exact problem.  </p>

<p>For example, as of 2018, the package <a href=""https://pypi.org/project/django-encrypted-model-fields/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">django-encrypted-model-fields</a> handles this with a syntax like</p>

    ...

gryp = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC)

","<p>This appears to be an error in the class documentation for Pycrypto's <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.Cipher.AES-module.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">AES</a>, as the AES implementation has been changed so that the IV is <strong>not</strong> optional for those modes that require one (i.e. you will have to pass 16 bytes of zeroes yourself, if that is how you want to do it).</p>

<p>See this <a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto/+bug/1018283"" rel=""noreferrer"">bug report for the same issue</a> where someone didn't specify an IV and looked up the online docs. There was a change that explicitly requires the IV and essentially, nobody has updated the online docs to reflect this. The class docs in the Pycrypto source were updated, but the online documentation needs to be regenerated to reflect this.</p>

<p>The new documentation from the source states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For all other modes, it must be <code>block_size</code> bytes longs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of the old version's</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For all other modes, it must be <code>block_size</code> bytes longs. It is optional and
  when not present it will be given a default value of all zeroes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The updated example in the source, which specifies iv, is:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto import Random

key = b'Sixteen byte key'
iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
msg = iv + cipher.encrypt(b'Attack at dawn')

The only difference I see in the Ruby code and my code is that they are not specifying the Initialization Vector, therefore its falling back to the default of all \x0's</p>

<p>When I try to instantiate PyCrypto without the iv it gives me an error. Here is an example:</p>

<p>I have to point out that pycrypto is supported by App Engine, it is included in <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries27"" rel=""noreferrer"">this list</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore I have included the module in my <code>app.yaml</code> file:</p>

<p>If I send the code in production on appengine it works, the problem is in my system I should probably download a compiled version of pycrypto and put it somewhere appengine can use it</p>
","<p><strong>Run the SDK from the command line with <code>dev_appserver.py</code>, rather than with the GUI</strong> (assuming you've already checked that it's installed via <code>pip</code>).</p>

<p>I've seen similar problems with App Engine not importing libraries locally, even though they're installed, and even though they work fine in production. MySQLDB comes to mind, although I can't find the reference. Anyway, this worked for me.</p>

","<p>Aha!</p>

<p>There's a difference of opinion what the ""256"" refers to.</p>

<p>AES has a fixed block size of 128 bits, so ""AES 256"" means 128 bit blocks, 256 bit <em>key</em>, 14 rounds.</p>

<p>However, Rijndael allows both the key size and the block size to vary. <code>MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256</code> refers to Rijndael with <em>block size</em> set to 256 (and I don't know how many rounds). So it does indeed take a 32 byte IV. Your PHP script is <em>not</em> using AES 256.</p>

<p>This is confirmed in <a href=""https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=47125"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=47125</a> -- the reporter considers it a bug in PHP mcrypt, PHP considers it a bug in libmcrypt, but it's not a bug, since libmcrypt does document what <code>MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256</code> means (at least the linux man page for mcrypt does, my Google-fu has failed to find any actual documentation for libmcrypt). That thing happens not to be the same as what AES 256 means.</p>

<p>So, you're encrypting and decrypting with ciphers that although related, might as well be completely different.</p>

<p>The bad news is that there doesn't appear to be a <code>Crypto.Cipher.RIJNDAEL</code> in PyCrypto. If you can pass a 256-bit key to MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128 in the PHP script, then that would be AES 256 (thanks Paŭlo).</p>

"9893080","PyCrypto: Decrypt only with public key in file (no private+public key)","<p>Hello everyone.</p>

<p>I am trying to play a bit with RSA public and private keys and encryption/decryption with <em>PyCrypto</em> and I have encountered and issue that seems kind of strange to me (it probably makes a lot of sense the way it's working now, but I don't know much about RSA asymmetric encryption and that's why it's puzzling me). It is the inability I have encountered to decrypt something having only the public key.</p>

<p>Here's the thing: I have a server and a client. I want the server to ""recognize"" and register the client and show it in a list of ""known devices"". The client will have the public key of the server and the server will have the public key of the client, so when the client communicates with the server, it will encrypt its data with his client's private key and with the server's public key. By doing this, only the proper server will be able to open the data (with its private key) and will be able to verify that the sender is actually the client that claims to be... well... or at least, that's what I think, because I'm pretty newbie in this asymmetric encryption. The idea is that when one of those clients wakes up, it will send its public key (encrypted with the server's public key, of course, but that's probably not relevant at this point... yet) saying ""<em>Hey, I'm a new client and this is my public key. Register that key with my UUID</em>"" and the server will obey, associating that public key with the client's UUID and use that key to decrypt data coming from that client. I just want to transmit the client's public key, keeping its private key secret, secret, secret (it's private, right?)</p>

<p>I am doing some tests with openssl and very simple Python scripts that use <em>PyCrypto</em> (actually, not even in a server/client architecture or anything... just trying to encrypt something with a private key and decrypt it with the public key)</p>

<p>First of all, I have created a public/private key set with:</p>

<pre><code>openssl genrsa -out ~/myTestKey.pem -passout pass:""f00bar"" -des3 2048
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, first thing that puzzles me a bit... It generates only one file, with both the private and the public keys... Well... O'right... whatever. I can extract the public key with:</p>

<pre><code>openssl rsa -pubout -in ~/myTestKey.pem -passin pass:""f00bar"" -out ~/myTestKey.pub
</code></pre>

<p>So I thought I had my couple of private (<em>private+public, actually</em>) and public keys in <code>~/myTestKey.pem</code> and <code>~/myTestKey.pub</code> respectively. Well... apparently I'm doing something wrong, because <em>PyCrypto</em> doesn't like this assembly. And I don't know why.</p>

<p>I have two very simple test scripts, ""<code>encryptor.py</code>"" and ""<code>decryptor.py</code>"". The ""<code>encryptor.py</code>"" should encrypt something with the private key, and ""<code>decryptor.py</code>"", decrypt it with the public key. I know... I'm a parangon of originality...</p>

<p>So, I encrypt the string ""<em>Loren ipsum</em>"" with my ""<code>encryptor.py</code>"" (with private key):</p>

<p>----------- encryptor.py ----------------</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python

from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

def encrypt(message):
    externKey=""/home/borrajax/myTestKey.pem""
    privatekey = open(externKey, ""r"")
    encryptor = RSA.importKey(privatekey, passphrase=""f00bar"")
    encriptedData=encryptor.encrypt(message, 0)
    file = open(""/tmp/cryptThingy.txt"", ""wb"")
    file.write(encriptedData[0])
    file.close()

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    encryptedThingy=encrypt(""Loren ipsum"")
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>And it works fine. Well... I suppose so, because in the file ""<code>/tmp/cryptThingy.txt</code>"" I get a lot of gibberish. It looks really, really encrypted to me.</p>

<p>But when I try to decrypt it using just the file that contains just the public key...</p>

<p>----------- decryptor.py ---------------</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python

from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

def decrypt():
    externKey=""/home/borrajax/myTestKey.pub""
    publickey = open(externKey, ""r"")
    decryptor = RSA.importKey(publickey, passphrase=""f00bar"")
    retval=None

    file = open(""/tmp/cryptThingy.txt"", ""rb"")
    retval = decryptor.decrypt(file.read())
    file.close()
    return retval


if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    decryptedThingy=decrypt()   
    print ""Decrypted: %s"" % decryptedThingy
</code></pre>

<p>... <em>PyCrypto</em> yells at me with a:</p>

    mp = self.key._decrypt(cp)
TypeError: Private key not available in this object
</code></pre>

<p>Yeah, of course it's not available! I extracted the public key! It took me 2 hours finding how to do it properly!! </p>

<p>What am I missing? As I said, I'm pretty newbie in this public/private asymmetric key encryption so I might have a core ""conceptual error""... Any hint will be appreciated.</p>

<p>¡Thank you in advance!</p>
","<p>You have it the wrong way round, you encrypt with the public key, and decrypt with the private key.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The publicly available encrypting-key is widely distributed, while the private decrypting-key is known only to the recipient. Messages are encrypted with the recipient's public key and can be decrypted only with the corresponding private key.

</blockquote>

<p>The idea is that you give the sending side the public key (which anyone can have, so you can distribute it in the open) then you encrypt the data with it, then decrypt it on your end with your private key (which only you have). This way the data stays secure.</p>

<p>You can encrypt something with the private key as the private key contains the information required to make the public key, but it would be unusual to do so, as normally the person encrypting the data does <em>not</em> have the private key.</p>

<p>The problem is that Xcode 4 has removed support for <code>-arch ppc</code> but the system Python 2.6 on Mac OS X 10.6 expects to build universal C extension modules with all three architectures.

&gt;&gt;&gt; from Crypto import Random
&gt;&gt;&gt; from struct import pack
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; bs = Blowfish.block_size

&gt;&gt;&gt; padding = [plen]*plen
&gt;&gt;&gt; padding = pack('b'*plen, *padding)

</code></pre>

<p>I did not find any example on how to decrypt. </p>
","<p>Let's make some observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>CBC mode needs an Initialization Vector (IV) that has the same length as the block size</li>
<li>the full plaintext is the actual message including padding (PKCS#5 padding in <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2898#section-6.1.1"" rel=""noreferrer"">RFC 2898 Sec. 6.1.1 Step 4</a>)</li>
<li>the IV is prepended to the ciphertext</li>
</ul>

<p>What needs to be done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the same key</li>
<li>Read the IV before creating the decryptor</li>
<li>Remove padding after decryption by looking at the last byte, evaluate that as an integer and remove as many bytes from the end of the plaintext</li>
</ul>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import Blowfish

bs = Blowfish.block_size
key = b'An arbitrarily long key'
ciphertext = b'\xe2:\x141vp\x05\x92\xd7\xfa\xb5@\xda\x05w.\xaaRG+U+\xc5G\x08\xdf\xf4Xua\x88\x1b'
iv = ciphertext[:bs]
ciphertext = ciphertext[bs:]

cipher = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_CBC, iv)
msg = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)

","<p>I've seen the code posted on the internet. There are - in principle - not too many things wrong with it, but there is no need to invent your own padding. Furthermore, I don't see why the first padding character is called INTERRUPT. I presume that INTERRUPT and PAD is handled as a single byte (I'm not a Python expert).</p>

<p>The most common padding is PKCS#5 padding. It consists of N bytes with the value of the number of padding bytes. The padding used here looks more like 'ISO' padding, which consists of a single bit set to 1 to distinguish it from the data and other padding bits, and the rest is zero's. That would be code point \u0080 in code.</p>

<p>So the encryption (which can provide confidentiality of data) seems to be used correctly. It depends on the use case if you also need integrity protection and/or authentication, e.g. by using a MAC or HMAC. Of course, no legal guarantees or anything provided.</p>

<h1>My Questions:</h1>

<p>Am I doing something wrong? Is it a compatibility issue? How do I get around this?</p>

<hr>

<p><em>(P.S.: Once again, this is my first time even using python – I'd be grateful if you could explain me this in the easiest way you can.)</em> </p>
","<p>It looks like <code>PyCrypto</code> is <a href=""https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/issues/168"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">not being maintained currently</a>. So, it's better you switch to <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycryptodome"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PyCryptodome</a>.</p>

<pre><code>pip install pycryptodome
</code></pre>

<p>If you still want to use PyCrypto you could still try,</p>

<p><code>brew install libffi</code></p>

At that point the install blows up because by default OSX now dies on warning flags, so suppress that behavior as well:</p>

<pre><code>export CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments
export CPPFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments

"20057764","Python pyCrypto RSA encrypt method gives same results using private or public key","<p>I'm trying to understand the pyCrypto encrypt and decrypt methods for public and private keys, and I'm seeing something strange. Suppose I have a set of private and public keys, stored in files dummy_private.txt and dummy_public.txt.</p>

<p>I create a private key object and public key object like this:</p>

<pre><code>private_key_file='dummy_private.txt'
f = open(private_key_file, 'r')
privateKey = RSA.importKey(f.read(),None)
f.close()

public_key_file='dummy_public.txt'
f = open(public_key_file, 'r')
publicKey = RSA.importKey(f.read(),None)
f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Now suppose I want to encrypt some message. I can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>s='This is a super secret message'
sutf8=s.encode('utf8')

enc=publicKey.encrypt(sutf8,None)[0]
encb64=base64.encodestring(enc)
print ""Public key Encoded message is %s"" % (encb64,)
</code></pre>

<p>This makes sense because I am encrypting with the public key and I should be able to decrypt with the private key.</p>

<p>However, I can also encrypt the above using the private key, and it gives me the same result!</p>

<pre><code>enc2=privateKey.encrypt(sutf8,None)[0]
encb642=base64.encodestring(enc2)
print ""Private key Encoded message is %s"" % (encb642,)
</code></pre>

<p>When I print out the base64 encoded version of the encrypted data, using either the private key or the public key, they are the same! Why is that?</p>

<p>And this raises the problem of digitally signing something with the private key. If I can sign something with the public key and get the same results, then how does signing verify that I am who I say I am? This must be some issue with the encrypt method that I don't understand. Can someone please explain?</p>

<p>Since encrypting with both the public key and private key gives the same results, it appears that decrypting with the private key can be done regardless of whether the encryption was done with the private key or the public key. I'm totally confused as to why one could encrypt with the private key and get a result that is the same as if it were done with the public key.</p>
","<p>When you encrypt with a private key, pycrypto is actually using the public key (which can be generated from the private key).  </p>

<p>Mathematically, RSA makes it possible to encrypt with the private key and decrypt with the public key, but you're not supposed to do that.  The public key is PUBLIC - it's something you would readily share and thus would be easily disseminated.  There's no added value in that case compared to using a symmetric cipher and a shared key (see: <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/2123/rsa-encryption-with-private-key-and-decryption-with-a-public-key"">https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/2123/rsa-encryption-with-private-key-and-decryption-with-a-public-key</a>)</p>

<p>Conceptually, ""encrypting"" with the private key is more useful for signing a message whereas the ""decryption"" using the public key is used for verifying the message.</p>

<p>When I was trying to install latest version I stumble upon ""Unable to find vcvarsall.bat"" error. I googled something about MinGW, so I installed that too. I've added it to my Windows PATH, but now i'm getting another error, which looks like this: ""command 'gcc' failed: no such file or directory."" What do i do now? Found something about gcc-mingw, which is some version of MinGW that could help? </p>

<p>Why is has to be so damn complicated :D.</p>

<hr>

<p>New development. Managed to install pycrytpo and fabric, but still can't run anything in the latter. New error says: ""ImportError: no module named win32api"". Quick google search says something about PyWin, but easy_install can't find it and it looks like it's abandoned. Any ideas?</p>
","<p>Well, it's so complicated because C (C++? Can't remember what they used at the moment, but I am pretty sure they used C) is much, much better at math than Python, so the math pieces of PyCrypto are all written in C. It does have a _slowmath module if the compiled versions aren't available, but it's name is telling... it is <em>much</em> slower.</p>

<p>gcc is the <strong>GNU Compiler Collection</strong> (&lt;!-- an edit, I had thought it stood for <em>GNU C Compiler</em>, but apparently my knowledge was dated). It is a bit legendary, but apparently your version of Windows has not heard of it. First question though, have you closed the ""DOS prompt"" and restart it? (it's in quotes because the people at superuser once <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/297678/dos-pauses-in-stdout-execution"">yelled at me</a> because I did not sufficiently acknowledge its inferiority) Environment Variables in Windows do not update during a ""DOS session"" (or whatever it is supposed to be called).</p>

<p>If you have, chances are that it can be found inside of the MingW install director -- if there is a bin folder I'd check there first. If not, I would search for gcc.exe and make sure that it's path is part of PATH. Then,</p>

<p>If all else fails, you might be able to get more info on MingW <a href=""http://www.mingw.org/wiki/InstallationHOWTOforMinGW"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

"6886240","Python - Pycrypto - Sending encrypted data over network","<p>I am trying to get 2 programs to share encrypted data over a network using public keys, but I am stuck with a difficult problem : the information that is shared (the keys and/or the encrypted data) seems to get modified. I am hoping to keep the encrypted data format as well as the format of the keys as simple as possible in order to allow compatibility with other languages.
To break down the problem, I have created 2 programs : Keyreceive and Keysend.
They execute in this order : </p>

<ol>
<li>Keyreceive starts up and waits to receive the encrypted data</li>
<li>Keysend starts up and generates an RSA key, saving the exported private key to a file</li>
<li>Keysend encrypts a piece of data and sends it to Keyreceive over the network</li>
<li>Keyreceive imports the private key from the same file, and uses it to decrypt the encrypted data</li>
<li>Keysend also decrypts the encrypted data to verify the result</li>
</ol>

<li>Install <a href=""http://www.mingw.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mingw</a>, including MSYS and the Development Toolkit. This will give you a fairly complete Unix-like development environment.</li>

<li>Download <a href=""http://www.mpir.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">MPIR</a> sources in a temporary directory. It is important you do <strong>not</strong> use 2.5.1 because of a bug that will break the build. 2.5.0 is fine.</li>
<li>Build the MPIR library. This is fairly straightforward: execute <code>bash configure</code> followed by <code>make</code>.</li>
<li><strong>HACK #1</strong> Copy <code>libmpir.a</code> from <code>mpir-2.5.0\.libs</code> into <code>C:\Python2.7.1\libs</code>. This is necessary because <code>distutils</code> is broken and I could not find a way to direct it to the correct library location.</li>
<li><strong>HACK #2</strong> Edit <code>C:\Python2.7.1\Lib\distutils\cygwincompiler.py</code> and remove any occurrance of the string <code>-mno-cygwin</code>. The reason is explained <a href=""http://www.secker.nl/2012/03/08/setup-python-2-7-2-and-mingw-on-windows-xp/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</li>
<li>Download <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/"" rel=""noreferrer"">PyCrypto</a> sources and unpack them in another temporary directory.</li>
<li>Set <code>CPPFLAGS</code> environment variable to the MPIR directory, which contains <code>mpir.h</code>.</li>
<li><p><strong>HACK 3</strong> Edit <code>setup.py</code> and add the following line in <code>build_extension</code> method:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>self.__add_compiler_option(os.environ['CPPFLAGS'])</p>

<li><p>Run <code>bash configure</code>. You should see two lines saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>checking for __gmpz_init in -lgmp... no<br>
  checking for __gmpz_init in -lmpir... yes</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Execute <code>python setup.py build -c mingw32</code>. You should see no errors.</li>
<li>Execute <code>python setup.py test</code> to verify that everything is fine.</li>
<li>Execute <code>python setup.py install</code> to copy the files into your local Python repository.</li>
<li>Alternatively, run <code>python setup.py bdist_wininst</code> to create an installer.</li>

<p>I have previously used pycrypto to do some basic encryption/decryption in python and am thus-far quite comfortable with all of the tools involved -- including the necessary public-key ciphers.  Moreover, I am also aware that pycrypto has some shortcomings, in the fact that it only implements the bare-bones, low level encryption/decryption algorithms needed to implement RSA and does not implement a full protocol for public-key encryption.  I also know that pycrypto contains some other useful tools such as an AllOrNothing transform which can be used for padding the communication, etc.  However, my question is: can anyone recommend any online articles, books, blog posts, projects, etc. which can help me in my quest to implement an effective RSA protocol?</p>

<p>The current version PyCrypto (2.6) <strong>does</strong> support all major RSA protocols for signature and encryption namely those specified in PKCS#1 (v1.5, PSS, OAEP).</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP

","<h2>Encryption (providing confidentiality)</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you want to encrypt/decrypt in the same application, then you simple should swap the public key and the private key.</li>
<li>Encryption is always performed by the public key, decryption by the private key.</li>
<li>RSA does not have any security if you do it the other way around. </li>
<li>If you know the private key then a public key with a small public exponent can be easily guessed by an attacker.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Signature generation (providing authenticity & integrity)</h2>

<ul>
<li>From the code however it seems you want to sign a message, but you are using an algorithm (RSA OAEP) that has been designed explicitly for encryption. </li>
<li>Unfortunately both concepts are not compatible. First of all, OAEP padding mechanism is not compatible with the one for signing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, there may be differences in handling the keys </p>

<ul>
<li>the library will handle private keys operations differently from public key operations. - - Private keys require security, such as protection against side channel attacks.</li>
<li>Note that that a public key allows for a larger range of values than a private key (the public exponent may be small or large, the private exponent should always be near the key size). </li>
</ul>

<p>So the components of a private key will always match those of a public key. But as public keys normally have a small public exponent, public keys may not always be accepted as private keys.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>only good solution</strong> is to replace your own signing operation with the correct one. - -- Fortunately Python handles PSS signing operations, take a look at the <a href=""http://pythonhosted.org/pycrypto/Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_PSS-module.html"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation here</a>, which helpfully contains sample code.</li>

","<p>PyCrypto does not have inbuilt feature for padding. But it is quite easy to implement it. Note: PKCS7 Padding will add an extra byte block when the input is already the correct size, which this function does as well.
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_(cryptography)#PKCS#5_and_PKCS#7"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>PKCS#7</code></a> padding is explained here.</p>

<pre><code>def pad(m):
    return m+chr(16-len(m)%16)*(16-len(m)%16)

KEY = sha256(passphrase).digest()  #returns 256 bit key
cipher = AES.new(KEY,AES.MODE_ECB) #creates a AES-256 instance using ECB mode
ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(pad(data)).encode('base64')
</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully, this is what you are looking for. 
During the process of Decryption, the <code>unpad</code> function might come handy.</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>def unpad(ct):
    return ct[:-ct[-1]]
</code></pre>

<p>In Python 3, the unpad function may need to cast (depending on usage), looking like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>def unpad(ct):
    return ct[:-ord(ct[-1])]
</code></pre>

<p>P.S,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ECB mode of encryption is not cryptographic secure. Please use higher modes such as CBC, OFB or GCM.</p>
  
  <p>GCM or Galois/Counter Mode provides both data confidentiality as well as authentication (Even for associated data, which need not be encrypted).</p>
  
  <p>It is the most secure mode yet unless you use the same nonce twice</p>

"13907841","Implement OpenSSL AES Encryption in Python","<p>I'm trying to implement the following in Python:
openssl enc -e -aes-256-cbc -base64 -k ""Secret Passphrase"" -in plaintext.txt -out ciphertext.txt</p>

<p>openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -base64 -k ""Secret Passphrase"" -in ciphertext.txt -out verification.txt</p>

<p>I've tried several different modules, PyCrypto, M2Crypto, etc but can't seem to get the correct combination of changing the password to the right size key and encoding everything correctly.  I've found <a href=""https://github.com/nvie/SimpleAES"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nvie/SimpleAES</a> but that basically runs OpenSSL on the command line, which I'd rather avoid.</p>
","<p>Base 64 encoding and decoding can be easily handled via the standard <code>base64</code> module.</p>

<p>AES-256 decryption and encryption in CBC mode are supported by both PyCrypto and M2Crypto.</p>

<p>The only non-standard (and most difficult) part is the derivation of the IV and the key from the password. OpenSSL does it via its own <code>EVP_BytesToKey</code> function, which is described <a href=""http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/EVP_BytesToKey.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in this man page</a>.</p>

<p>The Python equivalent is:</p>

<pre><code>def EVP_BytesToKey(password, salt, key_len, iv_len):
    """"""
    Derive the key and the IV from the given password and salt.
    """"""
    from hashlib import md5
    dtot =  md5(password + salt).digest()
    d = [ dtot ]
    while len(dtot)&lt;(iv_len+key_len):
        d.append( md5(d[-1] + password + salt).digest() )
        dtot += d[-1]
    return dtot[:key_len], dtot[key_len:key_len+iv_len]
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>key_len</code> is 32 and <code>iv_len</code> is 16 for AES-256. The function returns the key and the IV which you can use to decrypt the payload.</p>

<p>OpenSSL puts and expects the salt in the first 8 bytes of the encrypted payload.</p>

<p>Finally, AES in CBC mode can only work with data aligned to the 16 byte boundary. The default padding used is PKCS#7.</p>

<p>The steps for encrypting are therefore:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generate 8 bytes of random data as salt.</li>
<li>Derive AES key and IV from password using the salt from step 1.</li>
<li>Pad the input data with PKCS#7.</li>
<li>Encrypt the padded using AES-256 in CBC mode with the key and the IV from step 2.</li>
<li>Encode in Base64 and output the salt from step 1.</li>
<li>Encode in Base64 and output the encrypted data from step 4.</li>
</ol>

<p>The steps from decrypting are the reverse:</p>

<ol>
<li>Decode the input data from Base64 into a binary string.</li>
<li>Treat the first 8 bytes of the decoded data as salt.</li>
<li>Derive AES key and IV from password using the salt from step 1.</li>
<li>Decrypt the remaining decoded data using the AES key and the IV from step 3.</li>
<li>Verify and remove the PKCS#7 padding from the result.</li>
</ol>

<p>I would like to decrypt these things using Python. I'm attempting to use PyCrypto. Here's an exmaple script using the above data:</p>

<pre><code>from base64 import b64decode, b64encode
from hashlib import md5
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

secret = 'secret'
encoded = 'U2FsdGVkX1+4mP5A7IFV/VcgRs4ci/yupMErHjf5bkT5XrcowXK7z3VyyV1l2jvy'

<p>You can see that the salt matches, and the key matches the first half of what OpenSSL shows, so I seem to be on the right track, but there are two main questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why are the values for <code>key</code> and <code>iv</code> from OpenSSL twice as long as PyCrypto (and presumably AES256) allows?</li>
<li>How do I generate the correct values? The technique I'm using was taken from <a href=""http://deusty.blogspot.com/2009/04/decrypting-openssl-aes-files-in-c.html"" rel=""nofollow"">a blog</a>, but if the IV is always supposed to match the block size (16 bytes), MD5 will never work. And even if I could figure out where the other half of the key comes from, PyCrypto would refuse it for being too long.</li>
</ol>

<p>I realize I'll need to remove the padding as well, but I left that out for brevity.</p>
","<p>You have three problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>You use AES256 (32 byte key) in OpenSSL and AES128 (16 byte key) in your python code.</li>
<li>The IV computation is wrong. Each step in the OpenSSL's key derivation function uses the the MD5 digest computed last.</li>
<li>You mix up binary and hexadecimal representation. Keep any conversion to hexadecimal as the last step, before visualization.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following code should be correct:</p>

<pre><code>from base64 import b64decode, b64encode

<blockquote>
  <p>You can verify that hidden import is the problem by using Python's verbose imports flag. If the import messages say ""module not found"", but the warnproject.txt file has no ""no module named..."" message for the same module, then the problem is a hidden import.</p>
  
  <p>Hidden imports are handled by hooking the module (the one doing the hidden imports) at Analysis time. Do this as follows:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>Create a file named hook-module.py (where module is the fully-qualified Python name, eg, hook-xml.dom.py) and place it somewhere. Remember the place as your private hooks directory.</p></li>
  <li><p>In the .spec file, pass your private hooks directory as hookspath argument to Analysis so will be searched. Example:</p>
  
  <p>a = Analysis(['myscript.py'], hookspath='/my/priv/hooks') 
  In most cases the hook module will have only one line:</p>
  
  <p>hiddenimports = ['module1', 'module2']
  When the Analysis finds this file, it will proceed exactly as though the module explicitly imported module1 and module2.</p></li>

Decryption will happen by reading in 64KB + 32B chunks and calculating the HMAC of the first 64KB and comparing it against the SHA-256 sum occupying the last 32 bytes in the chunk.</p>

<p>Is this the right way to use an HMAC? Does it ensure security and authentication that the data was unmodified and decrypted with the right key? </p>

<p>FYI, the AES and HMAC keys are both derived from the same passphrase which is generated by running the input text through SHA-512, then through bcrypt, then through SHA-512 again. The output from the final SHA-512 is then split into two chunks, one used for the AES password and the other used for the HMAC.</p>
","<p>I don't think there is a security problem with what you're doing with the HMACs (not that that means there isn't a problem with the security), but I don't know the actual value in HMAC sub elements of the ciphertext gets you.  Unless you want to support partial recovery of the plaintext in the event of tampering, there is not much reason to incur the overhead of HMACing 64 KB blocks, vs the full ciphertext.</p>

<p>From a key generation perspective, it might make more sense to use a key generated from a passphrase to encrypt two randomly generated keys, and then use the randomly generated keys to perform HMAC and AES operations.  I know using the same key for both your block cipher and HMAC is bad news, but I don't know if using a key generated in the same manner is similarly bad. </p>

<p>At the very least, you should tweak your key derivation mechanism. bcrypt is a password hashing mechanism, not a key derivation function.  You should use PBKDF2 to do key derivations.</p>

","<p><strong>Yes, there are 2 security problems.</strong></p>

<p>But first, I assume that with this statement at the end:</p>

<pre><code># write out encrypted data and an HMAC of the block
outfile.write(cipher.encrypt(input_chunk) + hmac.new(hmac_key, data, hashlib.sha256).digest())
</code></pre>

<p>you actually meant:</p>

<pre><code># write out encrypted data and an HMAC of the block
data = cipher.encrypt(input_chunk)
outfile.write(data + hmac.new(hmac_key, data, hashlib.sha256).digest())
</code></pre>

<p>Because <code>data</code> is not defined anywhere.</p>

<p>The 1st security problem is that you are authenticating each piece independently of the others, but not the composition. In other words, the attacker can reshuffle, duplicate, or remove any of the chunks and the receiver will not notice.</p>

<p>A more secure approach is to have one instance of HMAC only, pass all the encrypted data to it via the <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.Hash.HMAC.HMAC-class.html#update"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>update</code></a> method, and output one digest, at the very end.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you want to enable the receiver to detect tampering before receiving the whole file, you can output the intermediate MAC for each piece. In fact, a call to <code>digest</code> does not change the state of the HMAC; you can keep calling <code>update</code> afterwards.</p>

<p>The 2nd security problem is that you don't use salt for your key derivation (I say that because you don't send it). Apart from password cracking, if you encrypt more than 2 files using the same password the attacker will also be able to freely mix chunks taken by either encrypted file - because the HMAC key is the same. Solution: use salt.</p>

<p>One last minor thing: <code>infile.read(64 * 1024)</code> may return less than <code>64*1024</code> bytes, but <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4426581/python-eof-for-multi-byte-requests-of-file-read"">that does not mean you reached the end of the file</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
","<p>So, what you are doing seems to make little sense. 
You want to securely  send a message from a server to a client?</p>

<p>The code you have attempts to  encrypt a message under the severs public key, then under the client's public key. The client won't be able to read this because he should never ever have the server's private key (Which is needed to read the message encrypted under the servers public key). Or put another way, if the server and client both have the same private key, then you should just use AES. Why are you doing this ? </p>

<p>Really, you probably ought to just send a message to the client using ssl/tls/https ,since writing cryptographic code is problematic and you have made at least two bad errors in your code along with the one you want fixed. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Your IV needs to be securely random. The python random call is not, which is why you use os.random(16) for the key. you should do so for the IV as well</p></li>
<li><p>You need to use an hmac to authenticate the encrypted data and key the hmac with a separate random key.   Then using the same key on the other end, regenerate the hmac over the same inputs, and compare the two. If  you don't do this, someone could tamper with your data and use errors in the crypto libraries to read it.</p></li>
<li><p>The problem you posted: Note as I said above you should not be doing this at all because it's nonsensical. You need to encrypted rsaEncryptedPasswordWithServer with AES under a new key(and use HMAC as per 2 above) and then encrypt the new key with the clients public key.</p></li>

<p>SHA-1 (the default hash function) has a 160 bit digest, that is 20 bytes. The limitation that you see sounds about right: 256 = 214 + 2 + 2*20.</p>

<p>Beside that, the extra step you plan to add does not add much value. If you want the client to prove to the server it's really him, and not somebody else, you should provide the client with the private key and have the server to keep the public half. After the encryption step, the client could <strong>sign</strong> the whole package (wrapped AES key + encrypted data) with PKCS#1 PSS and send the signature along. The server will verify the origin with the client's public key, then decrypt the key using its own private key, and finally decrypt the data with AES.</p>

"10212515","PyCrypto: Encrypt an string twice using RSA and PKCS#1","<p>Hello everyone.</p>

<p>I was wondering if it's possible to do a double <em>RSA/PKCS#1</em> encryption with PyCrypto.</p>

<p>I have a server that has its own RSA key (generated with the <code>openssl</code> command when said server is installed) and a client which can request the public part of the server's key. Also, that client can ask the server to generate another RSA key (or key-pair) for it. In that case, the server also keeps the private (or the ""whole"" RSA key) and sends the client the public part of its key.</p>

<p>I've been playing around with RSA/PKCS and AES encription. I have created a test Python file that works fine encrypting with only one RSA key. What it does is encrypting the data with the symmetric AES system (which uses a random key generated ""on-the-fly""), cyphers the password used for AES using the RSA/PKCS#1 system and puts it in the result to be sent:</p>

<p>As you can see, the AES password is encrypted with the server's RSA key. Now, I'd like to be extra paranoid, and encrypt that already encrypted password with the Client's public key, so the ""encrypt"" method would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>def encrypt(string):
    #Begin RSA Part to get a cypher that uses the server's public key
    externServerKeyFilename=""/home/borrajax/rsaKeys/server-key.pub""
    externServerKeyFile = open(externServerKeyFilename, ""r"")
    rsaServerKey= RSA.importKey(externServerKeyFile, passphrase=""F00bAr"")
    pkcs1ServerEncryptor=PKCS1_OAEP.new(rsaServerKey)
    #End RSA Part

    #Begin RSA Part to get a cypher that uses the client's public key
    externClientKeyFilename=""/home/borrajax/rsaKeys/client-key.pub""
    externClientKeyFile = open(externClientKeyFilename, ""r"")
    rsaClientKey= RSA.importKey(externClientKeyFile, passphrase=""F00bAr"")
    pkcs1ClientEncryptor=PKCS1_OAEP.new(rsaClientKey)
    #End RSA Part


    #Begin AES Part
    iv = ''.join(chr(random.randint(0, 0xFF)) for i in range(16))
    thisMessagePassword = os.urandom(16)
    aesEncryptor = AES.new(thisMessagePassword, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    chunksize=64*1024
    #End AES Part

    #Begin RSA Encription of the AES Key
    rsaEncryptedPasswordWithServer = pkcs1ServerEncryptor.encrypt(thisMessagePassword)
    rsaEncryptedPasswordWithServerAndClient = pkcs1ClientEncryptor.encrypt(rsaEncryptedPasswordWithServer) #Katacrasssshh here!! 

    retvalTmp = cStringIO.StringIO()
    retvalTmp.write(struct.pack('&lt;Q', len(string)))
    retvalTmp.write(struct.pack('&lt;Q', len(rsaEncryptedPasswordWithServerAndClient)))
    #...Probably some yadda yadda here with key lengths and stuff so it would help re-build the keys in the server's side...
    retvalTmp.write(rsaEncryptedPasswordWithServerAndClient)
    retvalTmp.write(iv)
    while len(string) &gt; 0:
        chunk = string[0:chunksize]
        string = string[chunksize:]
        if len(chunk) % 16 != 0:
            chunk += ' ' * (16 - len(chunk) % 16)
        retvalTmp.write(aesEncryptor.encrypt(chunk))
    return retvalTmp.getvalue()
</code></pre>

<p>But when I try to re-encrypt the key, I get a <code>ValueError(""Plaintext too large"")</code> exception. Which makes sense (at least makes sense to someone who barely knows anything about encryption) because PKCS adds a padding so when I encrypt the ""<code>thisMessagePassword</code>"" with the server's public key, I get a 256 bytes string, which is too long for the second PKCS encryptor (I've been doing some ""manual testing"" and the limit seems to be 214 bytes... I mean... that is the last value that doesn't throw an exception).</p>

<p>I am aware that is probably a weird construct and that it would probably make more sense use the server's public key for encryption and signing with the client's key, but I'm just trying to play a bit with encryption things and try to understand how they work and why. That's why any hint will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
","<p>I'm not recommending you do this, or suggesting it makes any sense, but if you just want to play with it here is what you can do.</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure the modulus of the first RSA key you apply <strong>is less than</strong> the the modulus of the second RSA key you apply.</li>
<li>Perform the first RSA encryption using the smaller modulus and proper PKCS#1 padding</li>
<li>Perform the second RSA encryption using the larger modulus and no padding.</li>
</ol>

<p>On decrypt you must reverse the order of these operations of course.</p>

So when I convert it to a string for writing to file, I'll need to convert it back to type 'tuple' when I'm decrypting. How can I do this? Or maybe there is a better way of achieving my desired result that I haven't considered?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>Even though more than one year has passed since you asked the question, I nevertheless want to provide an actual answer to your problem, because I have myself struggled with this minute yet uncomfortable error, so that anyone who encounters this situation would be able to quickly solve it.</p>

<p>First of all, as the other answer suggests, for human readability I would use base64 encoding:</p>

<pre><code>enc_key = RSAkey.encrypt(key, '')

enc_key = base64.b64encode(enc_key[0]) 
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>[0]</code> represents the first value of the tuple which is generated by the <code>encrypt</code> method (the ciphertext itself).</p>

<p>Then, when you want to decrypt the whole thing, you call:</p>

<pre><code>aes_key = RSAkey.decrypt(base64.b64decode(enc_key))
</code></pre>

<p>which should return you the original plaintext without the <code>ValueError: Message too large</code></p>

<p>I checked JS from browser console, it shows IV in <code>CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(password, passphrase)</code> is a object with some attributes( like <code>sigBytes:16, words: [-44073646, -1300128421, 1939444916, 881316061]</code>). It seems generated randomly. </p>

<p>From one web page, it tells me that JS has two way to encrypt password 
(<a href=""http://www.cnblogs.com/Lifehacker/p/nodejs_aes_encrypt_problem.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">reference link</a> ):</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>a. <code>crypto.createCipher(algorithm, password)</code></li>
  <li>b. <code>crypto.createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv)</code></li>
  </ul>

<p>What I saw in JavaScript should be option a. However, only option b is equivalent to AES.new() in python.</p>

<p><strong>The questions are</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How can I restore this password in Python without changing JavaScript code? </p></li>
<li><p>If I need IV in Python, how can I get it from the password that is used in JavaScript? </p></li>
</ol>
","<p>You will have to implement OpenSSL's <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/EVP_BytesToKey.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>EVP_BytesToKey</code></a>, because that is what CryptoJS uses to derive the key and IV from the provided password, but pyCrypto only supports the key+IV type encryption. CryptoJS also generates a random salt which also must be send to the server. If the ciphertext object is converted to a string, then it uses automatically an OpenSSL-compatible format which includes the random salt.</p>

<p>CryptoJS defaults to 256 bit key size for AES, PKCS#7 padding and CBC mode. AES has a 128 bit block size which is also the IV size. This means that we have to request 32+16 = 48 byte from EVP_BytesToKey. I've found a semi-functional implementation <a href=""https://gist.github.com/gsakkis/4546068"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> and extended it further.</p>

<p>Here is the full Python (tested with 2.7 and 3.4) code, which is compatible with CryptoJS:</p>

    while len(final_key) &lt; output:

        final_key += key
    return final_key[:output]

    key_iv = bytes_to_key(passphrase, salt, 32+16)
    key = key_iv[:32]
    iv = key_iv[32:]
    aes = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)

Is it still like that?</p>

<p>Of course I can always call <code>os.execute</code>, and execute the above command, but I'd consider that ""cheating"" <strong>:-)</strong>. I'm pretty much doing this to learn PyCrypto.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
","<p>Starting from PyCrypto 2.5 you can export an RSA private key and have it protected under a passphrase. A Triple DES key is internally derived from the passphrase and used to perform the actual encryption.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto import RSA
from Crypto import Random

random_generator = Random.new().read
key = RSA.generate(1024, random_generator)
exportedKey = key.exportKey('PEM', 'my secret', pkcs=1)
</code></pre>

<p>The variable <code>exportedKey</code> contains an ASCII version (PEM) of the key, encoded according to PKCS#1 (a cryptographic standard. Another option is <code>pkcs=8</code> for - guess what - PKCS#8). Since the result is standard, you can use it with several other programs, including openssl.
And of course, you can also re-import it back into python via PyCrypto!</p>

<p>The <code>exportKey</code> method is documented <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.PublicKey.RSA._RSAobj-class.html#exportKey"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

"41980931","Image encryption and decryption using Pycrypto","<p>How can I encrypt images using the <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycrypto"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pycrypto</a> python library? I found some <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12524994/encrypt-decrypt-using-pycrypto-aes-256"">text encrypting examples</a> on internet, but I didn't find the same with images. Can anyone help me?</p>
","<p>It is just the same as encrypting or decrypting text.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>First import some modules:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto import Random
</code></pre>

<p>After that, let us generate a key and an initialisation vector.</p>

<pre><code>key = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Encryption</strong></p>

<p>Now the code below loads an input file <code>input.jpg</code> and encrypts it, and afterwards it saves the encrypted data on a file <code>encrypted.enc</code>. In this example, the AES block cipher is used with the CFB mode of operation.</p>

<pre><code>input_file = open(""input.jpg"")
input_data = input_file.read()
input_file.close()

cfb_cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
enc_data = cfb_cipher.encrypt(input_data)

enc_file = open(""encrypted.enc"", ""w"")
enc_file.write(enc_data)
enc_file.close()
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Decryption</strong></p>

<p>Finally, the code below loads the encrypted file <code>encrypted.enc</code> and decrypts it, and afterwards it saves the decrypted data on a file <code>output.jpg</code>. </p>

<pre><code>enc_file2 = open(""encrypted.enc"")
enc_data2 = enc_file2.read()
enc_file2.close()

cfb_decipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
plain_data = cfb_decipher.decrypt(enc_data2)

output_file = open(""output.jpg"", ""w"")
output_file.write(plain_data)
output_file.close()
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong></p>

<p>For simplicity, the encryption and the decryption have been done in the same Python session, so the variables <code>key</code> and <code>iv</code> have been reused immediately, and to test this solution you have to do encryption and decryption in the same Python session. Of course, if you want to decrypt later in a separate session you will need to save <code>key</code> and <code>iv</code> and to reload them when you need to decrypt.</p>

<p><strong>Testing the solution</strong></p>

<p>Now you can open the <code>output.jpg</code> file and you should see an image which is identical to the one in <code>input.jpg</code>.</p>

","<p><code>urandom</code> <em>does</em> return cryptographically secure numbers, with a caveat. If it runs out of entropy (real random data generated by mouse movement, CPU temperature fluctuations on Ivy Bridge+ chips, etc), it will start producing less secure pseudo-random numbers.

On Unix systems, <code>/dev/random</code> will block while waiting for more entropy, while <code>/dev/urandom</code> will start generating pseudo-random numbers.</p>

","<p>There are many problems with your Python code <em>and</em> CryptoJS code:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You use a random IV to encrypt some plaintext in Python. If you want to retrieve that plaintext, you need to use <strong>the same IV</strong> during decryption. The plaintext cannot be recovered without the IV. Usually the IV is simply prepended to the ciphertext, because it doesn't have to be secret. So you need to read the IV during decryption and not generate a new one.</p></li>
<li><p>You use CBC mode in CryptoJS (default) instead of CFB mode. The mode has to be the same. The other tricky part is that CFB mode is parametrized with a segment size. PyCrypto uses by default 8-bit segments (CFB8), but CryptoJS is only implemented for fixed segments of 128-bit (CFB128). Since the PyCrypto version is variable, you need to change that.</p></li>
<li><p>The CryptoJS <code>decrypt()</code> function expects as ciphertext either an OpenSSL formatted string or a CipherParams object. Since you don't have an OpenSSL formatted string, you have to convert the ciphertext into an object.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>key</code> for CryptoJS is expected to be a WordArray and not a string.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the same padding. PyCrypto doesn't pad the plaintext if CFB8 is used, but padding is needed when CFB128 is used. CryptoJS uses PKCS#7 padding by default, so you only need to implement that padding in python.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Python code (for version 2):</p>

<pre><code>def pad(data):
    length = 16 - (len(data) % 16)
    return data + chr(length)*length

def unpad(data):

<hr>

<p><strong>Other considerations:</strong></p>

<p>It seems that you want to use a passphrase as a key. Passphrases are usually human readable, but keys are not. You can derive a key from a passphrase with functions such as PBKDF2, bcrypt or scrypt.</p>

<p>The code above is not fully secure, because it lacks authentication. Unauthenticated ciphertexts may lead to viable attacks and unnoticed data manipulation. Usually the an encrypt-then-MAC scheme is employed with a good MAC function such as HMAC-SHA256.</p>

","<p>(1 Year later but I hope this works for someone)</p>

<p>First of all, thanks Artjom B. your post helps me a lot. And Like OP, I have the same same problem Python server endonding and Javascript client decoding. This was my solution:</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Python 3.x</strong> (Server)</p>

<p>I used an excplicit <strong>PKCS7</strong> encode for padding, why? because I want to be sure Im using the same padding enconding and decoding, this is the link where I found it <a href=""http://programmerin.blogspot.com.co/2011/08/python-padding-with-pkcs7.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://programmerin.blogspot.com.co/2011/08/python-padding-with-pkcs7.html</a> .</p>

<p>Then, like Artjom B. said, be sure about your segment size, IV size and AES mode (CBC for me),</p>

<p>This is the code:</p>

<pre><code>def encrypt_val(clear_text):
    master_key = '1234567890123456' 
    encoder = PKCS7Encoder()
    raw = encoder.encode(clear_text)
    iv = Random.new().read( 16 )
    cipher = AES.new( master_key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv, segment_size=128 )
    return base64.b64encode( iv + cipher.encrypt( raw ) ) 
</code></pre>

<p>Note than your are enconding on base64 the concatenation of IV and encryption data.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Javascript</strong> (client)</p>

<pre><code>function decryptMsg (data) {
    master_key = '1234567890123456';

    // Decode the base64 data so we can separate iv and crypt text.
    var rawData = atob(data);
    // Split by 16 because my IV size
    var iv = rawData.substring(0, 16);
    var crypttext = rawData.substring(16);

    //Parsers
    crypttext = CryptoJS.enc.Latin1.parse(crypttext);
    iv = CryptoJS.enc.Latin1.parse(iv); 
    key = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(master_key);

    // Decrypt
    var plaintextArray = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(
      { ciphertext:  crypttext},
      key,
      {iv: iv, mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC, padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7}
    );

    // Can be Utf8 too
    output_plaintext = CryptoJS.enc.Latin1.stringify(plaintextArray);
    console.log(""plain text : "" + output_plaintext);
}
</code></pre>

<p>One of my main problem was keep in mind all kind of encoding and decoding data, for example, I didn't know that the master_key on client side was to be parse with Utf8.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I also tried several other things like <code>pip install pycrypto</code> and <code>sudo pip3 install pycrypto</code> and they didn't work. @l'L'l helped me get it to work by doing several strange, complex things that I never would have though have myself. They are summarized in the answer below.</p>
","<h2>Overview:</h2>

<p>The manual build you're trying looks like it might be failing because it's referencing the OS X 10.6 SDK, which you likely don't have, and is outdated for the most part. Also, SDKs are now stored in a completely different location than when the 10.6 SDK was in it's prime.</p>

<p><strong>New SDKs location:</strong></p>

<pre><code>/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Old SDKs location:</strong></p>

<pre><code>/Developer/SDKs/
</code></pre>

<h2>Non-existent / outdated SDK:</h2>

<p>Since it appears that when trying to build PyCrypto it's referencing the <code>MacOSX10.6.sdk</code> there are several things to consider:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why does it reference an outdated SDK</li>
<li>Where is the SDK it's referencing set</li>
<li>What should be done to correct the issue</li>
</ol>

<p>Unless we audit the source code carefully we might not know exactly where the incorrect flags are set, but we can do our best to work with the information we have. From the error we can see that there are several instances where the 10.6 SDK's name pops up:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/bin/clang -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -dynamic -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -fwrapv -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -std=c99 -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -Isrc/ -I/Library
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Building from source:</strong></p>

<pre><code>/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7 -c src/MD2.c -o build/temp.macosx-10.6-intel-2.7/src/MD2.o
src/MD2.c:30:10: fatal error: 'string.h' file not found
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
                 ^
1 error generated.
error: command '/usr/bin/clang' failed with exit status 1
</code></pre>

<p>Analyzing this we can see that the PyCrypto's MD2.c file is trying to be built using the flag <code>-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk</code>. It might be worth trying <code>pip</code> instead:</p>

<p><strong>Installing with pip:</strong></p>

<pre><code>...
fatal error: 'string.h' file not found #include &lt;string.h&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>Same error; we should probably find out if the <code>&lt;string.h&gt;</code> header even exists on the system — Let's make a quick test <code>C</code> application to find out:</p>

<p><strong>Testing the C headers:</strong></p>

<pre><code>$ echo ""#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() { printf(\""TEST\n\""); return 0; }"" &gt; t.c
$ clang t.c -o t
$ ./t
TEST
</code></pre>

<p>It's apparent the header does exist because the test worked fine. This tells us that the problem is more likely related directly to the 10.6 SDK (which doesn't seem to exist on the system). </p>

<p><strong>Symlinking (non-existing) 10.6 SDK to 10.11 SDK:</strong></p>

<p>Since we haven't determined where the SDK is actually getting set we'll go ahead and try to create symlinks so that any reference of the old 10.6 SDK links to the latest SDK (10.11 at this time):</p>

<pre><code>$ cd /Developer/SDKs
$ sudo ln -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk MacOSX10.6.sdk
</code></pre>

<p>We can verify the symlink by issuing the following command: </p>

<pre><code>$ ls -lat
total 8
drwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  102 Feb 21 15:54 .
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   99 Feb 21 15:54 MacOSX10.6.sdk -&gt; /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk
drwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  102 Feb 21 15:52 ..
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we've successfully created the symlink let's try installing PyCrypto with pip once more:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo pip install pycrypto
Collecting pycrypto
  Downloading pycrypto-2.6.1.tar.gz (446kB)
    100% |████████████████████████████████| 446kB 1.2GB/s 
Installing collected packages: pycrypto
  Running setup.py install for pycrypto ... done
Successfully installed pycrypto-2.6.1
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>No errors! It looks like our problem is solved! Well, almost...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We still need to figure out what is responsible for setting the wrong (10.6) SDK during builds. Let's use the <code>xcrun</code> tool to see what the defaults are set at:</p>

<pre><code>$ xcrun --show-sdk-version
10.11
</code></pre>

<p>The system default SDK is set to 10.11, so it must be get set incorrectly to 10.6 by Python, PyCrypto, or some other anomaly we might not have considered. </p>

<h2>UPDATE:</h2>

<p>After doing some recon it was discovered that <a href=""https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-351/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Python 3</a> appears to be built with the OS X 10.6 SDK. In addition it's also setting the SDK to 10.6 and setting the (outdated) path in numerous places throughout the <code>Python_Framework</code>. There are so many references I won't bother listing them all, although here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>Python_Framework Folder/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/config-3.5m/Makefile:79:CONFIGURE_CFLAGS= -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk
</code></pre>

<p><em>I can only assume the developers were trying to be as backward compatible as possible, however, it's unfortunately breaking forward compatibility in the process.</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> </p>

<p>Installing Python packages with <strong><a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>pip</code></a></strong> can make life much easier in a lot of ways (package management, updating, uninstalling, etc.). For example installing PyCrypto should just be a matter of issuing the command:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo pip install pycrypto
</code></pre>

<p>If you have <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2812520/pip-dealing-with-multiple-python-versions"">multiple Python's</a> you can use the version number to install for that Python accordingly:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo pip3.5 install pycrypto

","<p><em>Partial</em> answer coming along ...</p>

<hr>

<p>RSA works on numbers. You only get bytes out of it when you serialize those long integers. Since those numbers don't have a fixed size, they are serialized with as much bytes as are necessary, but not more.</p>

<p>An RSA encryption <strong><em>c = m<sup>e</sup></em> mod <em>n</em></strong> can result in ciphertexts, which are so much smaller than <strong><em>n</em></strong>, that not all the bytes are filled, because leading zeros of the the number don't have to be serialized. </p>

<p>Sometimes (depending on modulus and plaintext) it may happen that you're writing a 127 byte chunk instead of a 128 byte chunk during encryption, but you're always reading a 128 byte chunk during decryption. That means, you're taking away one byte from the next chunk. When the alignment breaks, you can run into various random behaviors such as a chunk being larger than the modulus and therefore not a valid ciphertext.</p>

<p>There are two ways to solve that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Always write the length of the ciphertext chunk before it.</strong></p>

<p>Encryption:</p>

<pre><code>data = f.read(readsize)
if not data:
    break
i += 1
enc_data = public_key.encrypt(data, 32)[0]

p.write(chr(len(enc_data)))
p.write(enc_data)
</code></pre>

<p>Decryption:</p>

<pre><code>length = f.read(1)
if not length:
    break
data = f.read(ord(length))
print(length, len(data))
j += 1
dec_data = private_key.decrypt(data)
p.write(dec_data[:readsize])
</code></pre>

<p>At the end you have to reduce the ciphertext to the original plaintext size, because you're working without PKCS#1 v1.5 padding or OAEP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pad the zero bytes that are missing during encryption.</strong></p>

<p>Encryption:</p>

<pre><code>data = f.read(readsize)
if not data:
    break
i += 1
enc_data = public_key.encrypt(data, 32)[0]

while len(enc_data) &lt; writesize:
    enc_data = ""\x00"" + enc_data
p.write(enc_data)
</code></pre>

<p>Decryption:</p>

<pre><code>data = f.read(writesize)
if not data:
    break
j += 1
dec_data = private_key.decrypt(data)
p.write(dec_data[:readsize])
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that <code>readsize = 127</code> and <code>writesize = 128</code>. <a href=""https://gist.github.com/artjomb/9a27bbaf400c21398d44"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a> are the full source codes for both variants.</p>

<hr>

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<h2>AES in Javascript</h2>

<p>I have an encrypted String which I can decrypt with this <a href=""http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/aes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this Javascript Implementation of AES 256 CTR Mode</a>
</p>

<pre><code>password = ""myPassphrase""
ciphertext = ""bQJdJ1F2Y0+uILADqEv+/SCDV1jAb7jwUBWk""
origtext = Aes.Ctr.decrypt(ciphertext, password, 256);
alert(origtext)
</code></pre>

<p>This decrypts my string and the alert box with <code>This is a test Text</code> pops up.</p>

<h2>AES with PyCrypto</h2>

<p>Now I want to decrypt this string with <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">python and PyCrypto</a></p>

<pre class=""lang-python prettyprint-override""><code>password = 'myPassphrase'
ciphertext = ""bQJdJ1F2Y0+uILADqEv+/SCDV1jAb7jwUBWk""
ctr = Counter.new(nbits=128)
encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr)
origtext = encryptor.decrypt(base64.b64decode(ciphertext))
print origtext
</code></pre>

<p>This code does not run. I get an <code>ValueError: AES key must be either 16, 24, or 32 bytes long</code>. When I recognized, that I have to do more in PyCrypto then just call a decrypt method, I started to investigate end try to figure out what I have to do.</p>

<h1>Investigation</h1>

<p>The basic things I figured out first, were:</p>

<ul>
<li>AES 256 Bit (?). But AES standard is 128 bit. Does increasing the passphrase to 32 Byte is enough?</li>
<li>Counter Mode. Easily to set in PyCrypto with AES.MODE_CTR. But I have to specify a counter() Method. So I used the <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.Util.Counter-module.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">basic binary Counter provided by PyCrypto</a>. Is this compatible with the Javascript Implementation? I can't figure out what they are doing.</li>
<li>The string is base64 encoded. Not a big problem.</li>
<li>Padding in general. Both passphrase and the encrypted string.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the passphrase they do this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>for (var i=0; i&lt;nBytes; i++) {
    pwBytes[i] = isNaN(password.charCodeAt(i)) ? 0 : password.charCodeAt(i);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I did this in python</p>

<pre class=""lang-python prettyprint-override""><code>l = 32
key = key + (chr(0)*(l-len(key)%l))
</code></pre>

<p>But this did not help. I still get a weird string <code>?
A???B??d9=  ,?h????'</code> with the following code</p>

<pre class=""lang-python prettyprint-override""><code>l = 32
key = 'myPassphrase'
key = key + (chr(0)*(l-len(key)%l))
ciphertext = ""bQJdJ1F2Y0+uILADqEv+/SCDV1jAb7jwUBWk""
ctr = Counter.new(nbits=128)
encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr)
origtext = encryptor.decrypt(base64.b64decode(ciphertext))
print origtext
</code></pre>

<p>Then I read more about the Javascript Implementation and it says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] In this implementation, the initial block holds the nonce in the first 8 bytes, and the block count in the second 8 bytes. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this could be the key to the solution. So I tested what happens when I encrypt an empty string in Javascript:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>origtext = """"
var ciphertext =Aes.Ctr.encrypt(origtext, password, 256);
alert(ciphertext)
</code></pre>

<p>The alert box shows <code>/gEKb+N3Y08=</code> (12 characters). But why 12? Shouldn't it be 8+8 = 16Bytes? Well anyway, I tried a <em>bruteforce</em> method on the python decryption by testing the decryption with <code>for i in xrange(0,20):</code> and <code>ciphertext[i:]</code> or <code>base64.b64decode(ciphertext)[i:]</code>. I know this is a very embarrassing try, but I got more and more desperate. And it didn't work either.</p>

<p>The future prospects are also to implement the encryption in the same way.</p>

<h1>additional information</h1>

<p>The encrypted string was not originally encrypted with <a href=""http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/aes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this Javascript implementation</a>, It's from another source. I just recognized, that the Javascript code does the right thing. So I affirm that this kind of implementation is something like a <em>""standard""</em>.</p>

<h1>The question</h1>

<p>What can I do, that the encryption and decryption from a string with PyCrypto is the same like in the Javascript implementation, so that I can exchange data between Javascript and Python? 
I also would switch to another crypto library in python, if you can suggest another one.
Furthermore I'm happy with any kind of tips and feedback.</p>

<p>And I think, all comes down to <strong>How can I include the nonce and block count to the encrypted string?</strong> and <strong>How can I extract this information for decryption?</strong></p>
","<p>We are still dealing with a bunch of questions here.</p>

<p><strong>How can I extract the nonce and the counter for decryption?</strong></p>

<p>This is easy. In the Javascript implementation (which does not follow a particular
standard in this respect) the 8-byte nonce is prepended to the encrypted result.
In Python, you extract it with:</p>

<pre><code>import base64
from_js_bin = base64.decode(from_js)
nonce = from_js_bin[:8]
ciphertext = from_js_bin[8:]
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>from_js</code> is a binary string you received.</p>

<p>The counter cannot be extracted because the JS implementation does not transmit it.
However, the initial value is (as typically happens) 0.</p>

<p><strong>How can I use the nonce and counter to decrypt the string in Python?</strong></p>

<p>First, it must be established how nonce and counter are combined to get the counter block.
It seems that the JS implementation follows the <a href=""http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-38a/sp800-38a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NIST 800-38A standard</a>, where the
left half is the nonce, and the right half is the counter. More precisely, the counter
is in big endian format (LSB is the rightmost byte). This is also what Wikipedia shows:
<img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Ctr_encryption.png"" alt=""AES CTR mode"">.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, CTR mode is poorly documented in PyCrypto (a <a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto/+bug/899818"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">well-known problem</a>).
Basically, the <code>counter</code> parameter must be a <em>callable</em> object that returns
the correct 16-byte (for AES) counter block, for each subsequent call.
<code>Crypto.Util.Counter</code> does that, but in an obscure way.</p>

<p>It is there only for performance purposes though. You can easily implement it yourself like this:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import struct

class MyCounter:

  def __init__(self, nonce):
    """"""Initialize the counter object.

    @nonce      An 8 byte binary string.
    """"""
    assert(len(nonce)==8)
    self.nonce = nonce
    self.cnt = 0

  def __call__(self):
    """"""Return the next 16 byte counter, as binary string.""""""
    righthalf = struct.pack('&gt;Q',self.cnt)
    self.cnt += 1
    return self.nonce + righthalf

cipher_ctr = AES.new(key, mode=AES.MODE_CTR, counter=MyCounter(nonce))
plaintext = cipher_ctr.decrypt(ciphertext)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>How long is the key for AES?</strong></p>

<p>The key length for AES-128 is 16 bytes.
The key length for AES-192 is 24 bytes.
The key length for AES-256 is 32 bytes.
Each algorithm is different, but much of the implementation is shared.
In all cases, the algorithm operate on 16 byte blocks of data.
For simplicity, stick to AES-128 (<code>nBits=128</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Will your code work?</strong></p>

<p>I have the feeling it won't, because the way you compute the AES key seems incorrect.
The JS code encodes the password in UTF-8 and encrypts it with itself.
The result is the actual key material. It is 16 byte long, so for AES-192 and -256, the implementation copies part of it at the back. Additionally, the plaintext is also UTF-8 encoded before encryption.</p>

<p>In general, I suggest you follow this approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make your JS implementation reproducible (right now encryption depends on the current time, which changes quite often ;-) ).</li>
<li>Print the value of the keys and data at each step (or use a debugger).</li>
<li>Try to reproduce the same algorithm in Python, and print the values too.</li>
<li>Investigate where they start to differ.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have duplicated the encryption algorithm in Python, the decryption one should be easy.</p>

<p>can anyone please let me know how to solve this and install pycrypto-2.3 successfully on my machine.</p>
","<p>It's always worth reading the documentation first. I'll quote from pycrypto's README:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Red Hat users often run into this because they don't have the
  python2-devel RPM installed. The fix is to simply install the
  requisite RPM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em><strong>edit</em></strong> I'll add, don't get your software from a website like softpedia (especially not crypto software!). Get it from the <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/"" rel=""nofollow"">pycrypto website</a> and verify the signature and file hash.</p>

<p>What am I missing ?</p>

<p>thanks.</p>
","<p>First of all, that Java example code is very bad. It outputs the ciphertext as an integer, whereas ciphertext should remain a binary string. The reason is that an integer can be represented in an infinite number of binary encodings. For instance, the number one can be '0x01' (1 byte), '0x0001' (2 bytes), and so forth. When you are dealing with cryptographic functions, you must be extremely precise with the representation.</p>

<p>Additionally, the example uses the default values of the <code>javax.crypto</code> API, which are not described anywhere. So it is really trial and error.</p>

<p>For the solution, you must know <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7822956/how-to-convert-negative-integer-value-to-hex-in-python"">how to convert negative integers to hex strings in Python</a>. In this case, you don't need a hex string, but its byte representation. The concept is the same though. I use PyCrypto's <code>long_to_bytes</code> to convert a positive integer (of arbitrary length) to a byte string.</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import Blowfish
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes

def tobytestring(val, nbits):
    """"""Convert an integer (val, even negative) to its byte string representation.
    Parameter nbits is the length of the desired byte string (in bits).
    """"""
    return long_to_bytes((val + (1 &lt;&lt; nbits)) % (1 &lt;&lt; nbits), nbits/8)

key = b'jaas is the way'
c1  = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_ECB)

fromjava = b""-27038292d345798947e2852756afcf0a""
# We don't know the real length of the ciphertext, assume it is 16 bytes
ciphertext = tobytestring(int(fromjava, 16), 16*8)
print c1.decrypt(ciphertext)
</code></pre>

<p>The output is:</p>

<pre><code>'testpython\x06\x06\x06\x06\x06\x06'
</code></pre>

<p>From that you see that <code>javax.crypto</code> also adds PKCS#5 padding, which you need to remove by yourself. That is trivial to do though.</p>

<p>However, the <strong>real</strong> solution to your problem is to do Java encryption in a better way. The Python code will be greatly simplified. </p>

My understanding is that the Java code is using Blowfish, and the phrase 'jaas is the way' as the key for the cipher.  But I can't make any sense of how to do this in python.  The following results in mostly unprintable garbage:</p>

<pre><code>import Crypto
from Crypto.Cipher import Blowfish
from base64 import b64encode, b64decode

bs        = Blowfish.block_size
key       = 'jaas is the way'
plaintext = b'27038292d345798947e2852756afcf0a'
iv        = '\0' * 8

c1 = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_ECB)
c2 = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_CBC, iv)
c3 = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_CFB, iv)
c4 = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_OFB, iv)

msg1 = c1.decrypt(plaintext)
msg2 = c2.decrypt(plaintext)
msg3 = c3.decrypt(plaintext)
msg4 = c4.decrypt(plaintext)

print ""msg1 = %s\n"" % msg1
print ""msg2 = %s\n"" % msg2 
print ""msg3 = %s\n"" % msg3 
print ""msg4 = %s\n"" % msg4 
</code></pre>

<p>What am I missing ?</p>

<p>thanks.</p>
","<p>This helps me</p>

<pre><code>private byte[] encrypt(String key, String plainText) throws GeneralSecurityException {

    SecretKey secret_key = new SecretKeySpec(key.getBytes(), ALGORITM);

    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secret_key);

    return cipher.doFinal(plainText.getBytes());

How can I ensure that  PyCrypto is encrypting data correctly according to the various encryption algorithms such as RSA and AES?</p>
","<p>Note that I am not an expert in crypto either. That said, I took a quick look at the PyCrypto code on github and at their mailing list. One of the things that gives me confidence is that there is good, expert contributions to the code base. The developers acknowledge insecurities and work to correct them.</p>

<p>If you have a specific use case that you need to be implemented securely, look at their code and ask on their list. Since they seem to leverage C/C++ libraries to do the work in many cases, you can check out the reputation of the base libraries directly.</p>

How can I ensure that  PyCrypto is encrypting data correctly according to the various encryption algorithms such as RSA and AES?</p>
","<p>It depends.</p>

<p>Some parts of PyCrypto are really good.  For example, the API for Crypto.Random (introduced in PyCrypto 2.1) was designed to be pretty foolproof, and the underlying algorithm it uses (Fortuna) was also designed to be pretty foolproof.</p>

<p>Other parts are just implementations of low-level crypto primitives, so it works, but you have to know what you are doing to use them correctly.  For example, Crypto.PublicKey.RSA doesn't implement the full RSA PKCS#1 standard (which is what most people think about when they talk about ""RSA"").  It only implements the basic RSA primitive (m^e mod n and c^d mod n), and you still have to provide your own PKCS#1 implementation.</p>

<p>The best way to ensure that PyCrypto is encrypting your data correctly (without reading the source code, which I encourage everyone to do) is to use a standard protocol and/or message format, and test that your code interoperates with other implementations.  If you're making up your own message format (which you probably shouldn't do anyway), then you need to be very careful to ensure that PyCrypto is actually doing everything that you think it's doing.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I'm the current PyCrypto maintainer, so my opinions shouldn't be considered an independent review.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> PyCrypto v2.5 and later now include proper RSA PKCS#1 encryption and signature implementations.  See the API documentation for Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEP and Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_PSS for details.</p>

"24152521","pycrypto installation: configure error: cannot run C compiled programs","<p>Please be gentle on me.  I have searched the site, and I know there is another answer to this exact question, but the answers posted there aren't working for me.  </p>

<p>I am trying to install <code>pycrypto</code>, so that I can get <code>paramiko</code> to work.  <code>Paramiko</code> is failing because of a missing <code>pycrypto</code> module.  I have tried using <code>pip install pycrypto</code> which succeeds, but does not cure the problem.</p>

<p>I have tried installing a binary version of <code>pycrypto</code> and that doesn't solve the problem.</p>

<p>Now I am trying to build <code>pycrypto</code>.  I have <code>cygwin64</code> and <code>mingw</code> installed on my machine.  The approach that gets the farthest is</p>

<pre><code>python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32
</code></pre>

<p>This gets to an error, </p>

<pre><code>checking whether we are cross compiling... configure: error: in `/cygdrive/c/Python27/pycrypto-2.6.1':
configure: error: cannot run C compiled programs.
</code></pre>

<p>The other answer suggests removing spaces in the path.  I have tried reducing the path to simply </p>

<pre><code>c:\mingw;c:\python2.7;c:\cygwin64\bin
</code></pre>

<p>with no change to the result?  </p>

<p>Does anyone have a fix they can point me to?  Thank you.  The overall goal is to get <code>paramiko</code> to work.  The <code>paramiko</code> error is </p>

<pre><code>ImportError: No module named Crypto.PublicKey
</code></pre>
","<p>In my case, the <code>/tmp</code> mount point was mounted with the <code>noexec</code> flag. </p>

<p>For windows with cygwin, I would check the mount point too, as well as dependencies such as the <code>vcredist</code> packages required for python2 and python3, see also <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13596407/errors-while-building-installing-c-module-for-python-2-7/19915585#19915585"">Errors while building/installing C module for Python 2.7</a>.</p>

<p>Two solutions for linux:</p>

<ul>
<li>remount temporarily with the exec flag (very likely requires root/sudo permissions)</li>
</ul>

<p>e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount -o remount,rw,exec /tmp
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>change the build path to a local mount point</li>
</ul>

<p>e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/python/tmp
pip install --build ~/python/tmp pycrypto
</code></pre>

<p>Note: it's worth looking at the other answers:</p>

<ul>
<li>verify <code>autoconf</code> and <code>python2-dev</code> or <code>python3-dev</code> packages are installed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks a lot in advance.. :)</p>
","<p>Looking at the <a href=""http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/doc/"" rel=""noreferrer"">documentation</a>, it seems that it's up to you, the library user, to pad the data yourself. The documentation states that the block size for AES is always 16 bytes, so you need to pad the data to a multiple of 16 bytes.</p>

<p>How the padding is done depends on the type of the data. For strings the best approach is probably to encode the string to a specific encoding and then take the length of that encoding. That way you're not relying on all characters being represented by an 8-bit codepoint:</p>

<pre><code>plaintext = data.encode('utf-8')
l = len(plaintext)
ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(plaintext + ((16 - len%16) * PADDING_BYTE))
</code></pre>

<p>A similar approach will work when you're data is an array of bytes.</p>

<p><code>0</code> should work fine as the <code>PADDING_BYTE</code>, but you need to take care to remove the padding when you're decrypting the data. It might be worth while including the length of the data in the ciphertext, e.g. prepend the length of the data to the plaintext before encryption, but then you need to jump through some hoops to make sure the padding is generated correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: oh yes, just like the RFC GregS links to mentions, the standard way of handling the length problem is the use the length of the padding as the padding byte. I.e. if you need 6 bytes of padding the padding byte is <code>0x06</code>. Note that if you don't need any padding, you to add a whole block of padding bytes (16 bytes of <code>0xa0</code>) so that you can recover the message correctly.</p>

"32577862","RSA-2048 decrypt not working - PKCS1_OAEP ""Incorrect decryption.""","<p>The code is supposed to set up a service that listens for connections from a voting website.  It is a server listening for connections from outside (clients).  When the client connects, the client waits for the version number to be sent.  Once my server/listener sends the version number, the client responds with a 256 byte block that is RSA 2048 bit encrypted using the public key I provide.  That block then has to be decoded and (later) I will read the contents.  I am stuck in that I can't get it decrypted:</p>

<p>I get this:</p>

"7842770","How to use pip install where one requirement has dependency on version on gcc-4.5","<p>I am installing an egg packaged for pip, inside my virtualenv, under Python 2.7.2.
The egg has 16 requirements, one of which (pycryptopp 0.5.29) is known to fail with gcc-4.6 and hence must be compiled with 4.5. The system has both gcc-4.6 (default) and gcc-4.5 installed.</p>

<p>(I already read the pip documentation and searched SO + SU)</p>
","<p>(I retitled the question from ""How to use pip install where one requirement must be compiled with gcc-4.5?"")</p>

<p>1) The correct method is to build with <em>""--disable-embedded-cryptopp""</em> which links to libcryptopp. <a href=""http://mail.python.org/pipermail/cplusplus-sig/2009-May/014531.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Some people report runtime issue</a> but It Works For Me.</p>

<pre><code>pip install --install-option=""--disable-embedded-cryptopp"" pycryptopp
</code></pre>

<p>2.) A truly ugly workaround which I used (and which ulif helpfully points out can be obviated by using CC=.. ) is to invoke pip install specifically for the problem package, and temporarily kludge the link to gcc.</p>

<pre><code>pushd /usr/bin; sudo rm gcc-4.6; ln -s gcc-4.5 gcc; popd;
pip install pycryptopp
pushd /usr/bin; sudo rm gcc-4.5; ln -s gcc-4.6 gcc; popd;
</code></pre>

<p>Further reasons this is bad: it requires root access and messing with the link to gcc binary. It certainly can't be Makefile'd.</p>

","<p>No need to fiddle around with symlinks here. On most Linux systems you can set the compiler to use with the CC env var. In case of pycryptopp and pip the following might help:</p>

<pre><code>$ CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.5 pip install pycryptopp
</code></pre>

<p>given that you have GCC 4.5 installed in that location. This worked fine for me on Ubuntu 11.10 (oneiric) with packages gcc-4.5 and g++-4.5 installed.</p>

"16203619","Decrypting data in Python that was encrypted in 3DES by Java","<p>I'm trying to decrypt data using PyCrypto. The data was encoded in Java with the javax.crypto package. The encryption is Triple DES (referred to as ""<a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html#Cipher"" rel=""nofollow"">DESede</a>"" in Java). As far as I can tell, default settings are used for everything. However, when I go to decrypt the data in Python there is always a problem with the data.</p>

<p>Here's the Java code that does encrypting/decrypting:</p>

<pre><code>import sun.misc.BASE64Decoder;
import sun.misc.BASE64Encoder;

import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory;
import javax.crypto.spec.DESedeKeySpec;
import java.security.spec.KeySpec;

public final class Encrypter
{
    public static final String DESEDE_ENCRYPTION = ""DESede"";

    private KeySpec keySpec;
    private SecretKeyFactory keyFactory;
    private Cipher cipher;

    private static final String UNICODE_FORMAT = ""UTF8"";

    public Encrypter(String encryptionKey)
        throws Exception
    {
        byte[] keyAsBytes = encryptionKey.getBytes(UNICODE_FORMAT);
        keySpec = new DESedeKeySpec(keyAsBytes);
        keyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(DESEDE_ENCRYPTION);
        cipher = Cipher.getInstance(DESEDE_ENCRYPTION);
    }

    public String encryptString(String unencryptedString)
    {
        SecretKey key = keyFactory.generateSecret(keySpec);
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
        byte[] cleartext = unencryptedString.getBytes(UNICODE_FORMAT);
        byte[] ciphertext = cipher.doFinal(cleartext);

        BASE64Encoder base64encoder = new BASE64Encoder();
        return base64encoder.encode(ciphertext);
    }

    public String decryptString(String encryptedString)
    {
        SecretKey key = keyFactory.generateSecret(keySpec);
        cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key);

        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But when I take one of the base64-encoded strings that was produced by this code, I can't decode it. Here's an example of some of the python code I've tried:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import DES3
import array

key = &lt;value of the key, as a hex string&gt;
encryptedvalue = &lt;the value that's encrypted, as a string&gt;
keyarray = array.array('B', key.decode(""hex""))
des = DES3.new(keyarray)
value = des.decrypt(encryptedvalue.decode('base64'))

value.decode('utf-8') # Gives me an error
</code></pre>

<p>The errors I've gotten have looked along the lines of</p>

<pre><code>UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xa7 in position 6: invalid start byte
</code></pre>

<p>Which means that somewhere along the way, I haven't gotten something set up correctly. I've been working on this for a few hours, even going so far as trying to look into the <a href=""http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/6-b14/com/sun/crypto/provider/SunJCE.java"" rel=""nofollow"">SunJCE source code</a>, which <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html#SunJCEProvider"" rel=""nofollow"">implements DESede</a>, to see what defaults they use, but to no avail. I'm going to be using this as part of a script that runs automatically, so I'd really rather not have to use Java to do my decryption. Does anyone know what I need to do to decrypt my data correctly?</p>
","<p>All I had to do to make it work was to change this line</p>

<pre><code>keyarray = array.array('B', key.decode(""hex""))
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>keyarray = array.array('B', key.encode(""utf-8""))
</code></pre>

<p>This matches the way that java was encoding the key, allowing me to have the correct encryption key.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you've come here hoping to learn something from this question, here's some general advice:</p>

<ol>
<li>Double-check your assumptions: The key string was a hex string, so I assumed it was being used as such.</li>
<li>Make sure you know what your assumptions are: I didn't consciously think about how I was making an assumption about how the key was used. This tends to be a very frequent problem in both programming and life in general.</li>
<li>Check <em>all</em> the values along the way (<em>especially</em> when you have an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_%28software_testing%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Oracle</a>): Looking at the values in the byte arrays was what led me to realizing my problem.</li>

<p>I'm getting similar syntax errors when I try to install pycrypto as well. I tried <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1277124"">this answer</a> but in vain. I tried setting up for python 2.6 and 2.7 environments using setuptools-0.6c11-py2.6.egg and setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg but getting the same output.</p>

<p>I searched a lot online but cant find solution for this.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I'm on OSX 10.7 on macbook pro 2010, and have XCode 4 and 3 installed</p>

<p>I'd args with replaced with the latest version while trying the commands in the link above.</p>

<pre><code>python setup.py build --static-deps --libxml2-version=2.7.8  --libxslt-version=1.1.26

<p>I read on someother post and tried this as well</p>

<pre><code>STATIC_DEPS=true sudo easy_install --allow-hosts=lxml.de,*.python.org lxml

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<p>As @jdi suggested I did the following</p>

<pre><code>$ brew install --use-llvm libxml2
$ brew install --use-llvm libxslt
</code></pre>

<p>Installed gcc from <a href=""https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a>, since I was still facing issues with option 1 and 2 suggested </p>

<p>Then, either this</p>

<pre><code>$ export ARCHFLAGS=""-arch i386 -arch x86_64""
$ /usr/bin/python2.6 setup.py build
$ sudo /usr/bin/python2.6 setup.py install

<p>Or this, will work</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo env ARCHFLAGS=""-arch i386 -arch x86_64"" easy_install-2.6 lxml
</code></pre>

<p>Same worked for pycrypto as well  </p>
","<p>This right here is an indication that you are building it improperly: <code>/Developer/usr/bin/../lib/gcc/powerpc-apple-darwin10</code>, unless of course you are on an old powerpc machine. </p>

<p>Check the version of OSX you are running, and the commands you are using to build lxml. Chances are you might need to set <code>export ARCHFLAGS=""-arch i386 -arch x86_64""</code> in your shell before building, in order to avoid it building with <code>ppc</code>. Not sure why you are getting an old arch.</p>

<p>Also, make sure you have the latest Xcode installed. And, if you are following that link you posted, word for word, make sure you are using the most recent versions of those packages and not the literal versions as that link is 3 years old.</p>

<p>decrypt.py:</p>

<pre><code>class AESCipher:

<p>I'm successful in re-calculating the HMAC but when I try and then decrypt the cipher I get something that seems encrypted with �'s in the result.</p>

<p>I was getting errors about input length of cipher text but when I switched to CFB mode that fixed it so I don't think it's a padding issue.</p>
","<p>There are many problems with your code.</p>

<h1>Client (JavaScript):</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>AES has a block size of 128 bit and CFB mode expects a full block for the IV. Use</p>

<pre><code>var iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The <code>iv</code> and <code>hash</code> variables are WordArray objects, but <code>encrypted</code> is not. When you force them to be converted to strings by concatenating them (<code>+</code>), <code>iv</code> and <code>hash</code> are Hex-encoded, but <code>encrypted</code> is formatted in an OpenSSL compatible format and Base64-encoded. You need to access the <code>ciphertext</code> property to get the encrypted WordArray:</p>

<pre><code>var concat = iv + encrypted.ciphertext;
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>var registrationKey = iv + encrypted.ciphertext + hash;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>registrationKey</code> is hex-encoded. There is no need to encode it again with Base64 and bloat it even more:</p>

<pre><code>var basemessage = registrationKey;
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to convert the hex encoded <code>registrationKey</code> to base64 encoding, use:</p>

<pre><code>var basemessage = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(registrationKey).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>concat</code> is a hex-encoded string of the IV and ciphertext, because you forced the stringification by ""adding"" (<code>+</code>) <code>iv</code> and <code>encrypted</code>. The <code>HmacSHA256()</code> function takes either a WordArray object or a string. When you pass a string in, as you do, it will assume that the data is UTF-8 encoded and try to decode it as UTF-8. You need to parse the data yourself into a WordArray:</p>

<pre><code>var hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(concat), hmacKey);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The <code>CryptoJS.AES.encrypt()</code> and <code>CryptoJS.HmacSHA256()</code> expect the key either as a WordArray object or as a string. As before, if the key is supplied as a string, a UTF-8 encoding is assumed which is not the case here. You better parse the strings into WordArrays yourself:</p>

<pre><code>var encryptionKey = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(masterKey.substr(0, length));
var hmacKey = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(masterKey.substr(length));
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h1>Server (Python):</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>You're not verifying anything in <code>verify_hmac()</code>. You hash the same data with the same key twice. What you need to do is hash the IV+ciphertext and compare the result with the hash (called tag or HMAC-tag) that you slice off the full ciphertext.</p>

<pre><code>def verify_hmac(self, input_cipher, mac):
    # Calculate hash using derived key from local password
    local_hash = HMAC.new(self.hmac_key, digestmod=SHA256)
    local_hash.update(input_cipher)
    local_digest = local_hash.digest()

    return mac == local_digest
</code></pre>

<p>And later in <code>decrypt()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>verified_hmac = self.verify_hmac((iv+cipher_text), hmac)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You need to correctly slice off the MAC. The 60 that is hardcoded is a bad idea. Since you're using SHA-256 the MAC is 32 bytes long, so you do this</p>

<pre><code>hmac = enc[-32:]
cipher_text = enc[16:-32]
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The CFB mode is actually a set of similar modes. The actual mode is determined by the segment size. CryptoJS only supports segments of 128 bit. So you need tell pycrypto to use the same mode as in CryptoJS:</p>

<pre><code>cipher = AES.new(self.key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv, segment_size=128)
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to use CFB mode with a segment size of 8 bit (default of pycrypto), you can use a modified version of CFB in CryptoJS from my project: <a href=""https://github.com/artjomb/cryptojs-extension#cfb"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Extension for CryptoJS</a></p></li>

","<p>By default, Crypto++ employs PKCS5 padding to the plaintext strings. This <strong>adds padding to the end</strong> of the string to make sure the string is a multiple of the block size which, for AES, is 16 bytes. If the plaintext is already a multiple of 16, Crypto++ adds another 16 bytes of padding to the plaintext and then encrypts the whole thing. PyCrypto doesn't add this extra padding, leaving it up to the user to ensure the correct block size. Note that when you decrypt the Crypto++-encrypted cipher text, the extra padding is automatically removed.</p>

","<p>Since lambda runs under the hood on amazon linux instances, you basically need to:</p>

<ol>
<li>spin up an amazon linux ec2 instance</li>
<li>create a virtualenv and <code>pip install</code> all packages you need</li>
<li><code>scp</code> the files down to wherever your local deployment package lives</li>
</ol>

<p>This all happens due to issues with how <code>pip install</code> does things differently depending on whether you're on linux or mac (and I'm assuming windows as well). </p>

<h3>here's a startup script to get the ec2 instance up to speed afaik</h3>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

sudo yum upgrade -y
sudo yum group install -y ""Development tools""

sudo yum install -y \
    python27 \
    libffi libffi-devel \
    openssl openssl-devel

virtualenv venv

<p>I've been using a combination of <code>pip install</code> on my local mac and doing this when a package doesn't work (like for <code>paramiko</code> and <code>psycopg2</code>), and there are a few other helpful packages that people have pre-compiled and put up on github elsewhere specifically for lambda. </p>

"11567290","CryptoJS and Pycrypto working together","<p>I'm encrypting a string in a web application using CryptoJS (v 2.3), and I need to decrypt it on the server in Python, so I'm using PyCrypto. I feel like I'm missing something because I can't can it working.</p>

<p>Here's the JS:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>Crypto.AES.encrypt('1234567890123456', '1234567890123456',
                   {mode: new Crypto.mode.CBC(Crypto.pad.ZeroPadding)})
// output: ""wRbCMWcWbDTmgXKCjQ3Pd//aRasZ4mQr57DgTfIvRYE=""
</code></pre>

<p>The python:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import base64
decryptor = AES.new('1234567890123456', AES.MODE_CBC)
decryptor.decrypt(base64.b64decode(""wRbCMWcWbDTmgXKCjQ3Pd//aRasZ4mQr57DgTfIvRYE=""))
# output: '\xd0\xc2\x1ew\xbb\xf1\xf2\x9a\xb9\xb6\xdc\x15l\xe7\xf3\xfa\xed\xe4\xf5j\x826\xde(m\xdf\xdc_\x9e\xd3\xb1'
</code></pre>
","<p>Here is a version with CryptoJS 3.1.2. Always beware of the following things (use the same in both languages):</p>

<ul>
<li>Mode of operation (CBC in this case)</li>
<li>Padding (Zero Padding in this case; better use PKCS#7 padding)</li>
<li>Key (the same derivation function or clear key)</li>
<li>Encoding (same encoding for key, plaintext, ciphertext, ...)</li>
<li>IV (generated during encryption, passed for decryption)</li>
</ul>

<p>If a string is passed as the <code>key</code> argument to the CryptoJS <code>encrypt()</code> function, the string is used to derive the actual key to be used for encryption. If you wish to use a key (valid sizes are 16, 24 and 32 byte), then you need to pass it as a WordArray.</p>

<p>The result of the CryptoJS encryption is an OpenSSL formatted ciphertext string. To get the actual ciphertext from it, you need to access the <code>ciphertext</code> property on it.</p>

<p>The IV must be random for each encryption so that it is semantically secure. That way attackers cannot say whether the same plaintext that was encrypted multiple times is actually the same plaintext when only looking at the ciphertext.</p>

<p>Below is an example that I have made.</p>

<p>JavaScript:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>var key = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse('1234567890123456');

function encrypt(msgString, key) {
    // msgString is expected to be Utf8 encoded
    var iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(16);
    var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(msgString, key, {
        iv: iv
    });
    return iv.concat(encrypted.ciphertext).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);
}

function decrypt(ciphertextStr, key) {
    var ciphertext = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(ciphertextStr);

    // split IV and ciphertext
    var iv = ciphertext.clone();
    iv.sigBytes = 16;
    iv.clamp();
    ciphertext.words.splice(0, 4); // delete 4 words = 16 bytes
    ciphertext.sigBytes -= 16;

    // decryption
    var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt({ciphertext: ciphertext}, key, {
        iv: iv
    });
    return decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Python code:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>BLOCK_SIZE = 16
key = b""1234567890123456""

def pad(data):
    length = BLOCK_SIZE - (len(data) % BLOCK_SIZE)
    return data + chr(length)*length

def unpad(data):
    return data[:-ord(data[-1])]

def encrypt(message, passphrase):
    IV = Random.new().read(BLOCK_SIZE)
    aes = AES.new(passphrase, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)
    return base64.b64encode(IV + aes.encrypt(pad(message)))

def decrypt(encrypted, passphrase):
    encrypted = base64.b64decode(encrypted)
    IV = encrypted[:BLOCK_SIZE]
    aes = AES.new(passphrase, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)
    return unpad(aes.decrypt(encrypted[BLOCK_SIZE:]))
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Other considerations:</strong></p>

<p>It seems that you want to use a passphrase as a key. Passphrases are usually human readable, but keys are not. You can derive a key from a passphrase with functions such as PBKDF2, bcrypt or scrypt.</p>

<p>The code above is not fully secure, because it lacks authentication. Unauthenticated ciphertexts may lead to viable attacks and unnoticed data manipulation. Usually the an encrypt-then-MAC scheme is employed with a good MAC function such as HMAC-SHA256.</p>

"5116760","RSA encryption in .NET, decryption in python","<p>I'm trying to encrypt a short message using RSA algorithm in C# and decrypt the message using a python skript.</p>

<p>I'd like to use the .NET classes on the C# side and <a href=""http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/"" rel=""nofollow"">pycrypto</a> on python side. I've managed both sides to use the same key (which was not even trivial since .NET doesn't support the standard PEM/DER format directly). Encryption/decryption works on both sides independently.</p>

<p>I'm using PKCS#1 padding on the C# side (setting the <code>fOAEP</code> parameter of <code>RSACryptoServiceProvider.Encrypt</code> to <code>false</code>), so I'd expect that after decrypting the block in python I should see some kind of clear text (i.e. my ""message"" together with padding bytes)</p>

<p>But all I see is garbage :(.</p>

<p>Are there any caveats/pitfalls I'm not aware of on either side? I'm kind of out of ideas ...</p>

<p>Thx
Martin</p>

<p><strong>Sample code</strong></p>

<p><em>C# / Encryption</em></p>

<pre><code>Console.Write(""Input string:"");
var s = Console.ReadLine();
var b = Encoding.Default.GetBytes(s);
var encrypted = rsa.Encrypt(b, false);
using (var file = new FileStream(filename, FileMode.Create)) {
  file.Write(encrypted, 0, encrypted.Length);
  file.Flush();
  file.Close();
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>Python / Decryption</em></p>

<pre><code>f = open(filename, ""rb"")
msg = f.read()
f.close()
decrypted = rsa.decrypt(msg)
print ""Decrypted message:""
print_hex(decrypted)
</code></pre>

<p>For Key transfer I'm using the <code>ToXmlString()</code> method of <code>RSACryptoServiceProvider</code>. The resulting XML is parsed in python and the <em>pycrypto</em>-RSA object is initialized with</p>

<pre><code>r = Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.construct((modulus, exponent, d, p, q))
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>modulus</code>, <code>exponent</code>, <code>d</code>, <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> are the respective fields of the .NET-<code>RSAParameters</code> structure. (as I've mentioned, I can encrypt/decrypt a message using this key in python, also <code>p*q</code> yields <code>modulus</code>, so I think the key import is working correctly ...)</p>
","<p>Ok, it was my fault, I just didn't look at the results: The leading zero (from PKCS#1 padding) is not part of the python result string, which looks (in hex) like:</p>

<pre><code>02 a2 16 4e 51 45 aa 8d 
94 b0 de 64 4d 4c 4c bd 
0b 01 b8 d2 de dc ed 23

<p>So, <code>02</code> at the beginning points to random padding (somehow I was expecting 0xff padding...). The last 6 bytes (after the zero) are exactly the ""Message"" I was expecting, but a normal <code>print</code> didn't show them just because of the zero byte...</p>

How can i do this? Converting to a string and back seems pretty error prone and since random bytes are in there, i would not trust that to be a good approach.
I was able to store random keys in a charfield by base-64 encoding it (like this: Random.new().read(16).encode('base64')). But a keypair?

","<p>you just need to store the private key, because you always can generate the public key from the private one.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
&gt;&gt;&gt; RSAkey = RSA.generate(1024)
</code></pre>

<p>The public key can be exported with</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; RSAkey.publickey().exportKey()
</code></pre>

<p>To save the private key you might want to convert it to a text with the <code>exportKey()</code> method and store it in a django-TextField:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; RSAkey.exportKey()
'-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMI...-----END'

<p>Converting the text back to a RSA key object is easy too:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto import Random
Random.get_random_bytes(5)

<p>I was wondering how this method is different from a simple generator like the following:</p>

<pre><code>import random
def get_random_bytes(N):

    return """".join(random.choice(ASCII) for _ in range(n))

<p><strong>Note</strong>: my intuition is that the Pycrypto method is more cryptographically ""sound"". Looking at <code>random</code>'s documentation, it says that it is based on a generator with a period of <code>2**19937-1</code>. Looking at <code>Random.get_random_bytes</code>, it states that it is capable of generating cryptographically-strong bytes. What does that mean?</p>

<p>Of course, I wish to use the library implementation, instead of my own. I just want to understand the cryptography concepts behind it.</p>
","<p>For a cryptographically secure random number generator any sequence of output provides you no information as for what the next output will be.</p>

<p>random is based on the Mersenne Twister. It has an internal state of 624 32-bit numbers. Given the output of 1248 values you know the entire state at some point. From that you can with 100% accuracy determine what all future outputs will be.</p>

<p>Of course it would—that's why exactly <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split"" rel=""nofollow""><code>split</code></a> has a second, optional argument <code>max_split</code>:</p>

<pre><code>key, value = line.split(':', 1)

<pre><code>key, _, value = line.partition(':')

<p>The difference between the two is what happens when there isn't a colon at all; the former will return one element, giving you a <code>ValueError</code> from trying to unpack it into two variables, while the latter will just give you an empty <code>value</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>However, it's worth noting that if you're using Base 64, <code>:</code> is never going to appear in the first place. The only character used by Base 64 are <code>A</code>-<code>Z</code>, <code>a</code>-<code>z</code>, <code>0</code>-<code>9</code>, <code>+</code>, and <code>/</code>. There are some Base 64 variants, and maybe one of them does use <code>:</code>, but the standard version, as applied by Python's <code>base64</code> module, does not.</p>

","<p>If you look at the <code>encrypt</code> method:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>plaintext</code> (byte string or long) - The piece of data to encrypt with RSA. It may not be numerically larger than the RSA module (n).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your data is not a byte string or long. If you want to input text then you first need to use a character encoding such as UTF-8 for input.</p>

<p>Note that ""plaintext"" is just the input for the cryptographic primitives. All modern ciphers operate on bytes. Historically the input may have been actual text, but not anymore.</p>

<hr>

<p>Also note that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Attention: this function performs the plain, primitive RSA encryption (textbook). In real applications, you always need to use proper cryptographic padding, and you should not directly encrypt data with this method. Failure to do so may lead to security vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use modules <code>Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEP</code> or <code>Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_v1_5</code> instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For these functions it is also required to convert your text to byte arrays.</p>

"14859006","Using PyCrypto to decrypt Perl encrypted password","<p>I'm trying to decrypt a pass phrase stored in a file.  The encryption was done with the Perl::CBC module, but I need to decrypt it for a Python script.  Frankly, I don't know much (or anything really) about encryption algorithms. </p>

<p>The pass phrase was encrypted something like this:</p>

<pre><code>use Crypt::CBC;

my $key = '0123456789';
my $iv  = '$KJh#(}q';

my $cipher = Crypt::CBC-&gt;new(
    -key    =&gt; $key,
    -cipher =&gt; 'Blowfish',
    -header =&gt; 'none',
    -iv     =&gt; $iv,
);

my $passphrase = 'You have decrypted the passphrase.';
my $hex_encrypted = $cipher-&gt;encrypt_hex($passphrase);
</code></pre>

<p>which gives an encrypted passphrase: 9033c838e4418fbdc50a9fc0813745296d195d59954008f94b2b36a8e65dca959686206960a7828a</p>

<p>Now, I need to use this in a Python script (using Python 2.7). Naively, I was hoping this would work:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import Blowfish
from binascii import hexlify, unhexlify

perl_pass =  unhexlify('9033c838e4418fbdc50a9fc0813745296d195d59954008f94b2b36a8e65dca959686206960a7828a')
key = '0123456789'
iv  = '$KJh#(}q'
print Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_CBC, iv).decrypt(perl_pass)
</code></pre>

<p>but that only seems to create a bunch of unprintable junk.  I've played around a bit without success.  I'm not really sure what I need to do here to get this password decrypted successfully.</p>
","<p>The ""key"" you give to Crypt::CBC is actually a passphrase, from which a 'literal key' is generated; Crypto.Cipher.Blowfish needs that literal key, rather than the passphrase. You can print that generated key in hex from your Perl program, then use it in Python:</p>

<pre><code>use Crypt::CBC;

my $key = '0123456789';
my $iv  = '$KJh#(}q';

my $cipher = Crypt::CBC-&gt;new(
    -key    =&gt; $key,

","<p>I am not sure this applies to your situation, but some googling led to this:</p>

<p>(from <a href=""http://wiki.python.org/jython/JythonFaq/InstallingJython"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://wiki.python.org/jython/JythonFaq/InstallingJython</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jython cannot find your Java class,
  even though it exists in the class
  path. This shows up as ""ImportError:
  cannot import name xxx"" or
  ""AttributeError: java package xxx' has
  no attribute 'yyy'""</p>
  
  <p>This happens when Jython is installed
  as a Java extension (i.e. when
  jython.jar is installed in
  java\jre\lib\ext) and your classes
  are installed in the classpath.</p>
  
  <p>The reason is Java extensions can only
  see other extensions, not other
  classes defined in the CLASSPATH or
  passed in to java using the
  --classpath option.</p>
  
  <p>There are two ways to fix this:</p>
  
  <p>1) Move your classes to the
  java\jre\lib\ext directory.</p>
  
  <p>2) Remove jython.jar from the
  java\jre\lib\ext directory and put
  jython.jar in the CLASSPATH or use the
  java --classpath option.</p>
  
  <p>(from the Jython-users mailing list)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And another, similar issue, but different nonetheless:</p>

<p>(from <a href=""http://bugs.jython.org/issue1878866"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://bugs.jython.org/issue1878866</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a similar problem in Linux with jython 2.5. Inside
  jython2.5.0/Lib/site-packages a have a foo directory where there is a
  Java class (Bar.class) and a jython class (BarPy.py). i have also put an
  empty __init__.py file. In the jython interpreter environment I can
  always import Bar like this: ""from foo import Bar"" however I cannot
  import BarPy. If I delete the java class from the directory then I can

<p>Here's what I'm doing now:</p>

<p>Generate self-signed cert and convert to DER encoding with openssl cli:</p>

<p>(I'm expecting DER in my real application)</p>

<pre><code>openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout selfsigned.key -nodes -out selfsigned.cert -sha256 -days 1000
openssl x509 -outform der -in selfsigned.cert -out self.der
</code></pre>

<p>Decode it to a <code>Crypto.Util.asn1.DerSequence</code> instance.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from Crypto.Util.asn1 import DerSequence
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
&gt;&gt;&gt; der = open('self.der').read()
&gt;&gt;&gt; cert = DerSequence()
&gt;&gt;&gt; cert.decode(der)
905L
&gt;&gt;&gt; # according to RFC5280, this is a 3-length sequence:
&gt;&gt;&gt; # tbsCertificate, signatureAlgorithm, signatureValue
&gt;&gt;&gt; # ""tbs"" == ""to be signed""
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(cert)
3
</code></pre>

<p>Then I pull the RSA public key out:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tbscert = DerSequence()
&gt;&gt;&gt; tbscert.decode(cert[0])
&gt;&gt;&gt; subjectPublicKeyInfo = tbscert[6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; rsa_key = RSA.importKey(subjectPublicKeyInfo)
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; rsa_key
&lt;_RSAobj @0x7fb27287d128 n(2048),e&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then I pull the signature out</p>

<p>This is very annoying. I'm using another library to decode the DER again because this one gives me a slightly more convenient representation of the ""bit string"" encoding of the signature value. For now, I copy and paste the base-2 string representation of the value into <code>int()</code> to get a <code>long</code> (what the <code>RSA.verify()</code> method expects).</p>

<p>Am i expecting too much of Node.js's standard libraries?</p>
","<p>The short answer to your question is: Yes, AES is the same in PyCrypto and Node.js' <code>crypto</code> module. Node's <code>crypto</code> is just a wrapper around <code>openssl</code> on your system, and PyCrypto is interoperable with OpenSSL (see <a href=""http://lists.dlitz.net/pipermail/pycrypto/2010q4/000301.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.dlitz.net/pipermail/pycrypto/2010q4/000301.html</a>).</p>

<p>Having said that, there are definitely bugs in the Node <code>crypto</code> module (though I've only experienced problems with base64 encoding, myself). So whether it's a bug or not, the problems you're experiencing are almost certainly happening in the data encoding/decoding stages.</p>

<p>What does your <code>ciphertext</code> look like? Is it a hexadecimal string? If so, then you need to do</p>

<pre><code>buf = decipher.update(buf, 'hex', 'binary')

","<p>That's not how IV works in Node, you have to use crypto.createDecipheriv(cipher, key, iv) instead, otherwise you get a default baked-in one. Even in PyCrypto you should be using the third argument to AES.new as the IV, not stuffing it into the bytestream.</p>

","<p>Documentation does not mention this, but <code>aeskey</code> you're passing to <code>crypto.createDecipher</code> is not <em>the</em> key, but a password, handled to OpenSSL's <a href=""http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/EVP_BytesToKey.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>EVP_BytesToKey</code></a> function.</p>

<p>To pass the actual raw key data one should use (presently undocumented) <code>crypto.createDecipheriv(cipher, key, iv)</code> function. This applies to ECB mode too, even though there's no IV in ECB.</p>

<p>If this fails, I think, the first step in debugging would be to try with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#Test_vectors"" rel=""nofollow"">AES KATs</a> to see whenever the decryption code is correct.</p>

I have a table of email addresses, and I would like to encrypt them for storage.  I am trying to encrypt them in the application, and then will decrypt them for viewing.  I'm not going for complete security but am mainly aiming to obfuscate the data enough were the database itself compromised.  </p>

<p>I'm using PyCrypto with AES, and have been trying to follow some posts on here and some web tutorials I found.  The closest I found so far is <a href=""http://codeghar.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/aes-encryption-with-python"" rel=""nofollow"">this post</a>, and it seems to work, at least encrypting it.  I follow that and get something like <code>""7hBAQrWhJRnL9YdBGJfRErGFwGi3aC6noGzYTrGwAoQ=""</code> stored in the database.  But the decrypt function keeps erroring with this: </p>

<pre><code>UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xa1 in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)
</code></pre>

<p>I came across some unicode presentation about Python which sort of helped me make more sense of it but I still keep getting the same error.</p>

<p>Is there a straightforward tutorial on how to encode, store in a database, pull out of database, and decode a source data string?</p>

<p>Do I need a specific collation on the database column?  Does the field need to be a certain type?  So far I've been using a default collation and setting it to VARCHAR, assuming that I was storing a string.  It sounds like I've got some encoding problem somewhere with incompatible types or something but my head is spinning on where I need to change something.</p>

<p>Any better pointers or anything else I can provide?  I can show my code but its basically a copy of the link above... I was just trying to get a proof of concept working before modifying it too much.</p>

<p>edit:
some sample source...
In MySQL, the table is 
id (int)
client_id (int)

<p>I was just trying to decode the first item just to try and get it to work but that's the part that seems to be giving it fits now....</p>
","<p>The general rule with PyCrypto is that cryptographic keys, IVs, plaintexts, paddings, and ciphertexts should always be defined as binary strings, not text. The fact you use Unicode for them is by itself a source of problems.</p>

<p>Another problems is that you pass to <code>AES.new</code> key and IV in hexadecimal encoded form, so that the former is 256 bits and the latter 128 bits. That seems still to work, but I guess your intention was to use AES128 - which has a 128 bit key. You therefore need to convert it to binary, for instance via <code>unhexlify</code>: the two character string b'34' will map to the single byte '\x34'. The IV needs to be twice as long.</p>

<p>In your code it's therefore better to have:</p>

<pre><code>from binascii import unhexlify

INTERRUPT = b'\x01'
PAD = b'\x00'
SECRET_KEY = unhexlify('a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8')
IV = unhexlify('12345678abcdefgh'*2)
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to encrypt text, you would first encode it (e.g. to UTF-8) and then pass it to your function <code>EncryptWithAES()</code>. See also this example taken from the <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.Cipher.AES-module.html"" rel=""nofollow"">PyCrypto API</a>:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto import Random

key = b'Sixteen byte key'
iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
msg = iv + cipher.encrypt(b'Attack at dawn')
</code></pre>

<p>The result of the encryption step (that is, the ciphertext) is again a binary string. In order to store it directly in the MySQL DB you must use either a <code>BINARY</code> or a <code>VARBINARY</code> type column.</p>

<p>Essentially, I do not know of a sensible way to install PyCrypto on Mac OS X 10.8 in such a way that <code>dev_appserver.py</code> will use it - other than the workaround of putting <code>Crypto/</code> into the project's root directory.</p>

<p>Unfortunately an issue seems to have just cropped up that causes a project to crash when the project is deployed with <code>Crypto/</code> in the project's root.</p>

<p>It may be possible to edit or monkeypatch the GAE code, but I am not familiar enough with GAE's code to be comfortable doing that. All of the suggestions I have seen were for Python2.5 and Mac OS X &lt; 10.8.</p>

<p>I would be grateful for thoughts about alternative, sensible ways to get PyCrypto working with the GAE development appserver on Mac OS X 10.8.</p>
","<p>This is the madness I have had to engage in:</p>

<li><p>Apply to <code>dev_appserver_import_hook.py</code> in <code>/Application/GoogleAppEngineLauncher.app/Contents/Resources/GoogleAppEngine-default.bundle/Contents/Resources/google_appengine/google/appengine/tools/</code> the patch suggested in <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1627#c1"" rel=""nofollow"">comment 1 of Issue 1627</a>, i.e. add</p>

<pre><code>try:
  import Crypto as _CryptoTest
  _CryptoBase = os.path.dirname(_CryptoTest.__file__).replace(

  del _CryptoTest
except ImportError:
  logging.info(""No Crypto could be imported"")

<p>and change all references from <code>'Crypto'</code> to <code>_CryptoBase</code> in the <code>GeneratePythonPaths</code> calls for ALLOWED_SITE_PACKAGES.</p>

<p>(I would expect if one is using dev_appserver from the command line i.e. /usr/local/google_appengine, the dev_appserver_import_hook.py would be modified there)</p></li>

<p>Actually, I don't know what does lambda do but I think that I get this error because of it. Thanks.</p>
","<p>you're reading your text file as <code>rb</code> which in python 3 returns a <code>bytes</code> object.</p>

<p>In the function, you're padding with a <code>str</code> object, hence the error. Python 3 clearly separates binary data from text data, a thing that python 2 didn't do.</p>

<pre><code>    PADDING = '{'
    pad = lambda s: s + (BLOCK_SIZE - len(s) % BLOCK_SIZE) * PADDING
</code></pre>

<p>Change <code>open('Aes/plaintext.txt', 'rb')</code> by <code>open('Aes/plaintext.txt', 'r')</code> and you'll get ascii on both sides, that will work.</p>

<p>(or change <code>PADDING</code> to <code>bytes('{',encoding=""ascii"")</code> or as James stated just <code>b""{""</code>).</p>

"31756166","Python 3 - Socket Chat Encryption with PyCrypto gives UnicodeDecodeError","<p>I am trying to setup a socket chat with encryption in Python 3, but when decoding UTF-8 it gives an error.</p>

<p>Here is the code:</p>

<p>Client:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES 
from Crypto import Random 
import socket, sys
host = 'localhost'
port = 5558
IV = Random.new().read(16) 
c = AES.new('abcd1234efgh5678', AES.MODE_CFB, IV) 
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((host,port))
data = 'hey'.encode('utf-8') # 1
data = c.encrypt(data) # 2
s.sendall(data)
</code></pre>

<p>Server:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES 
from Crypto import Random 
import socket, sys
host = ''
port = 5558
IV = Random.new().read(16) 
c = AES.new('abcd1234efgh5678', AES.MODE_CFB, IV) 
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
s.bind((host,port))
s.listen(10)
sock, addr = s.accept()
data = sock.recv(512)


data = c.decrypt(data) # 1
data = data.decode('utf-8') # 2
print(data)
</code></pre>

<p>After running these programs the server gives this error:</p>

<p>UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xa5 in position 0: invalid start byte</p>

<p>So, I tried changing 'utf-8' in the Server code to 'latin-1' and it instead kept printing different unicode characters each time the program was run. I then swapped the 2 lines marked with comments in both the client and server, and of course it gave this error:</p>

<p>AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'</p>

<p>I have tried Google but all of the programs that use PyCrypto use Python 2, not 3. Eg. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12524994/encrypt-decrypt-using-pycrypto-aes-256"">Encrypt &amp; Decrypt using PyCrypto AES 256</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2010/06/25/aes-encryption-of-files-in-python-with-pycrypto/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2010/06/25/aes-encryption-of-files-in-python-with-pycrypto/</a></p>
","<p>apart from the fact that your code above uses <code>//</code> as comments (should be <code>#</code>), i ran the code below (removed everything socket) and found the error: you re-initialize the <code>IV</code> before decrypting. this way you will not get the original value back - just some gibberish that may not be decodable in utf-8.</p>

<p>you will have to send the IV to the server (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1540491/how-to-communicate-aes-initialization-vector-to-client-for-hybrid-cryptosystem"">How to communicate AES initialization Vector to client for hybrid cryptosystem</a>).</p>

<p>I have searched every topic I could find regarding this exact error , both on this website and many other , but I could not find a fitting solution. (please , don't link me existing threads from this website)</p>

<p>Some things worth mentioning : I have tried setting up the env. variables , it didn't help. </p>

<p>I have also tried running vcvarsall.bat (inside VC) , as many have suggested. No effect.</p>

<p>Finally , I have tried reinstalling visual studio. 0 effect as well.</p>

<p>Any ideas ?</p>

<p>Edit the file <code>inttypes.h</code> and add just before the line of the error:</p>

","<p>The Javascript library (pidCrypt) uses PKCS#1 v1.5 for RSA encryption, not OAEP.</p>

<p>That is supported by PyCrypto (see <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_v1_5-module.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>). This is the example for encryption:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_v1_5
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Hash import SHA

message = 'To be encrypted'
h = SHA.new(message)

key = RSA.importKey(open('pubkey.der').read())
cipher = PKCS1_v1_5.new(key)
ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(message+h.digest())
</code></pre>

<p>And decryption:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Hash import SHA
from Crypto import Random

key = RSA.importKey(open('privkey.der').read())

dsize = SHA.digest_size
sentinel = Random.new().read(15+dsize)      # Let's assume that average data length is 15

cipher = PKCS1_v1_5.new(key)
message = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext, sentinel)

digest = SHA.new(message[:-dsize]).digest()
if digest==message[-dsize:]:                # Note how we DO NOT look for the sentinel
     print ""Encryption was correct.""
else:
     print ""Encryption was not correct.""
</code></pre>

<p>Note that PKCS#1 v1.5 encryption scheme is know to be <strong>badly</strong> broken.</p>

<pre><code>def genNewSeed(k=2048): #Generate seed for new AES key

</code></pre>

<p>Which, according to <code>sys.getsizeof()</code> is equal to 32 bits yet it still returns the error</p>
","<p>The problem is that you're slicing off only 11 bytes from a hex-encoded ""seed"" of 64 characters. Keep in mind that keys are supposed to have high entropy, otherwise it's easier to brute force them.</p>

<p>I suggest you use:</p>

<pre><code>def AESEncryptor(Seed, Block = 16): #Generate AES key and Cipher
    iv = Random.new().read(Block)
    cipher = AES.new(Seed, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    return cipher, iv

def genNewSeed(k=2048): #Generate seed for new AES key
    return hashlib.sha256(os.urandom(32)).digest()
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you a 32 byte key which makes this AES-256. If you want AES-128, then you can slice the last 16 bytes off:</p>

<pre><code>hashlib.sha256(os.urandom(32)).digest()[:16]
</code></pre>

<p>You cannot use <code>sys.getsizeof()</code> to determine the size of a key, because it includes all kinds of internal counters and data. For example, an empty string has already a size of 21 bytes. That's why you would thought that you got 32 byte when you only got 11 (21 + 11 = 32). Use the built-in <code>len(key)</code> instead.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Thanks to the accepted answer below, now I see:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My solution seems to be pretty valid for now (very few log entries, no performance considerations, more or less trusted storage). Concerning security, the best thing I can do right now is not forgetting to prohibit the user who runs my daemon from writing to the <code>.py</code> and <code>.pyc</code> files of the program. :-) However, if the user is compromised, he still may try to attach a debugger to my daemon process, so I should also disable login for him. Pretty obvious moments, but very important ones.</p></li>
<li><p>Surely there are solutions being much more scalable. A very common technique is to encrypt AES keys with slow but reliable RSA, and to encrypt data with the AES that is pretty fast. Data encryption in the case is symmetric, but retrieving the AES key requires either breaking RSA, or getting it from memory when my program is running. Stream encryption with higher-level libraries and binary log file format also are a way to go, though binary log format encrypted as a stream should be very vulnerable to log corruption, even a sudden reboot due to electricity blackout may be a problem unless I do some things at a lower level (at least log rotation on each daemon start).</p></li>
<li><p>I changed <code>.encode('hex')</code> to <code>.encode('base64').replace('\n').replace('\r')</code>. Fortunately, the base64 codec works fine with no line ends. It saves some space.</p></li>
<li><p>Using an untrusted storage may require signing records, but that seems to be another story.</p></li>
<li><p>Checking if the string is encrypted based on catching exceptions is ok, since, unless the log is tampered with by a malicious user, it's base64 codec who raises an exception, not RSA decryption.</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>You seem to encrypt data directly with RSA. This is relatively slow, and has the problem that you can only encrypt small parts of data. Distinguishing encrypted from plaintext data based on ""decryption doesn't work"" is also not a very clean solution, although it will probably work. You do use OAEP, which is good. You may want to use base64 instead of hex to save space.</p>

<p>However, crypto is easy to get wrong. For this reason, you should always use high-level crypto libraries wherever possible. Anything where you have to specify padding schemes yourself isn't ""high-level"". I am not sure if you will be able to create an efficient, line-based log encryption system without resorting to rather low-level libraries, though.</p>

<p><strong>If you have no reason to encrypt only individual parts of the log, consider just encrypting the entire thing.</strong></p>

<p>If you are really desperate for a line-based encryption, what you could do is the following: Create a random symmetric AES key from a secure randomness source, and give it a short but unique ID. Encrypt this key with RSA, and write the result to the log file in a line prefixed with a tag, e.g. ""KEY"", together with the ID. For each log line, generate a random IV, encrypt the message with AES256 in CBC mode using said IV (you don't have any length limits per line now!) and write the key ID, IV and the encrypted message to the log, prefixed with a tag, e.g. ""ENC"". After a certain time, destroy the symmetric key and repeat (generate new one, write to log). The disadvantage of this approach is that an attacker who can recover the symmetric key from memory can read the messages encrypted with said key. The advantage is that you can use higher-level building blocks and it is much, much faster (on my CPU, you can encrypt 70,000 log lines of 1 KB per second with AES-128, but only around 3,500 chunks of max. 256 bytes with RSA2048). RSA decryption is REALLY slow, by the way (around 100 chunks per second).</p>

<p>Note that you have no authentication, i.e. you won't notice modifications to your logs. For this reason, I assume you trust the log storage. Otherwise, see <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5848"" rel=""nofollow"">RFC 5848</a>.</p>

<p>I would expected it to be able to decrypt my cipher, but it doesn't. Thus I must be using pycrypto wrong. How do I fix this? The two sites can both encrypt and decrypt between each other, but mines can't. Both the websites do indeed use CBC mode.</p>

<p>Looking through its <a href=""https://github.com/mdp/gibberish-aes/blob/ba17eb3cec5c4bd41a8d52c98421cee4b99b3d48/src/gibberish-aes.js"" rel=""nofollow"">source code</a>, it seems to use a random salt for encryption. That, prepended by the string <code>Salted__</code> forms the beginning of the cyphertext before it is base64 encoded.</p>

<pre><code>randArr = function(num) {
    var result = [], i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; num; i++) {
        result = result.concat(Math.floor(Math.random() * 256));
    }
    return result;
},
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>enc = function(string, pass, binary) {
        // string, password in plaintext
        var salt = randArr(8),
        pbe = openSSLKey(s2a(pass, binary), salt),
        key = pbe.key,
        iv = pbe.iv,
        cipherBlocks,
        saltBlock = [[83, 97, 108, 116, 101, 100, 95, 95].concat(salt)];
        string = s2a(string, binary);
        cipherBlocks = rawEncrypt(string, key, iv);
        // Spells out 'Salted__'
        cipherBlocks = saltBlock.concat(cipherBlocks);
        return Base64.encode(cipherBlocks);
    },
</code></pre>

<p>For decryption, it uses picks the random portion of the salt out of the beginning of the cyphertext after base64 decoding (the first <code>slice</code> operator):</p>

<pre><code>dec = function(string, pass, binary) {
    // string, password in plaintext
    var cryptArr = Base64.decode(string),
    salt = cryptArr.slice(8, 16),
    pbe = openSSLKey(s2a(pass, binary), salt),
    key = pbe.key,
    iv = pbe.iv;
    cryptArr = cryptArr.slice(16, cryptArr.length);
    // Take off the Salted__ffeeddcc
    string = rawDecrypt(cryptArr, key, iv, binary);
    return string;
},
</code></pre>

<p>The missing piece now is the <code>openSSLkey</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>openSSLKey = function(passwordArr, saltArr) {
    // Number of rounds depends on the size of the AES in use
    // 3 rounds for 256
    // 2 rounds for the key, 1 for the IV
    // 2 rounds for 128
    // 1 round for the key, 1 round for the IV
    // 3 rounds for 192 since it's not evenly divided by 128 bits
    var rounds = Nr &gt;= 12 ? 3: 2,
    key = [],
    iv = [],
    md5_hash = [],
    result = [],
    data00 = passwordArr.concat(saltArr),
    i;
    md5_hash[0] = GibberishAES.Hash.MD5(data00);
    result = md5_hash[0];
    for (i = 1; i &lt; rounds; i++) {
        md5_hash[i] = GibberishAES.Hash.MD5(md5_hash[i - 1].concat(data00));
        result = result.concat(md5_hash[i]);
    }
    key = result.slice(0, 4 * Nk);
    iv = result.slice(4 * Nk, 4 * Nk + 16);
    return {
        key: key,
        iv: iv
    };
},
</code></pre>

<p>So basically you have to translate the <code>openSSLKey</code> function to Python and feed it your password and salt. That creates a (key, iv) tuple. Use those to encrypt your data. Prepend the string <code>Salted__</code> and the salt to the ciphertext before encoding it with base64. Then it should work, I think.</p>

","<p>First you should know how Python 3 treats strings differently than in Python 2.</p>

<p>In Python 2, <code>""""</code> is a byte array, but in Python 3 it's a unicode string. Both <code>cipher.encrypt</code> and <code>cipher.decrypt</code> expect byte arrays.</p>

<p>So even though in both pieces of code, the <em>type</em> of your parameter is fine. Your problem in Python 3 is with calling <code>str.encode</code>. It's pretty easy to see that it indeed caused a change by looking at the string length:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; len(encrypted_string)
10
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(encrypted_string.encode('utf-8'))
14
</code></pre>

<p>The solution:</p>

<p>First of all notice that in Python 2:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ""¨vóîÄdX|@9"" == '\xc2\xa8v\xc3\xb3\xc3\xae\xc3\x84dX|@9'
True
</code></pre>

<p>In Python 3, you need to mark your string with the binary prefix (<code>b""""</code>), your new definition should use: <code>encrypted_bytes = b'\xc2\xa8v\xc3\xb3\xc3\xae\xc3\x84dX|@9'</code></p>

<p>Thus your solution should be:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto import Random

key = ""18945BKJVO9W834G""
iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
encrypted_bytes = b'\xc2\xa8v\xc3\xb3\xc3\xae\xc3\x84dX|@9'
decrypted_bytes = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_bytes)

<p>Short description : <code>Byte</code> and <code>String</code> got same pattern, does not require any correction. Consider how the system is perceived if you do any encoding operation.Cryptographic logic is a byte-based function, which is not very important to which encoding system you are using.  If the input/output or output/input is important to you why do you change the encoding setting of the characters?

","<p>First, you should be encrypting only binary data, not Unicode text. That means <code>str</code> type (in Python 2.x) or <code>bytes</code> (in Python 3.x and most recent Python 2.x). You must encode text before encrypting it, and you must decode it after you decrypt.</p>

<p>Second, the byte string you are encrypting must be smaller than the RSA modulus (e.g. less than 256 bytes for RSA2048). If your data is longer, think of using an intermediate AES session key.</p>

<p>Third, if you use PyCrypto 2.5, there is no good reason for using the <code>.encrypt/.decrypt</code> methods of the RSA key object. It is better and more secure to use one of the PKCS#1 methods: <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEP-module.html"" rel=""nofollow"">OAEP</a> or <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_v1_5-module.html"" rel=""nofollow"">v1.5</a>.

Alternatively, is there a different library that I can use to decrypt the data?</p>
","<p>Thanks to the comments I implemented a suitable solution. I modified <code>rijndael.py</code> in the linked duplicate question to accept bytes rather than strings. I then use it as follows to decrypt 32-byte blocks with the 32-byte initialization vectors.</p>

<p>Note that using this rather than PyCrypto is only necessary because libmcrypt incorrectly sets the data block sizes, and thus the initialization vector sizes, to be equal to the key sizes. As far as I understand, data block sizes should always be 128 bits for AES-Rijndael.</p>

","<p>As pointed out in the comments 256 keys are quite small and can be factorized easily. First you have to reconstruct the prime numbers used in key generation. Finding the modulus and exponent is an easy one liner with openssl:</p>

<pre><code>$ openssl rsa -in &lt;your-public-key&gt; -pubin -text -modulus
</code></pre>

<p>This should output something like</p>

<pre><code>Exponent: &lt;decimal-value&gt; (&lt;hex-value&gt;)

<p>Now you can factorize the modulus with msieve or search for it within the <a href=""https://factordb.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://factordb.com/</a> database. This will give you your ""p"" and ""q"".

<p>Here they are:</p>

  <p>TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for pow(): 'str', 'int','int'</p>

","<p>In Python 3 there is a difference between strings and bytes. PyCrypto works on bytes, so you need to give it bytes, but <code>""Bob""</code> is a string. You can convert a string <code>a</code> to bytes with <code>a.encode()</code>, which uses a default encoding. If you have another encoding in mind, then you need to specify it. </p>

<p>You can also mark a literal string as bytes by prefixing it with a <code>b</code>. Example: <code>b""Bob""</code>.</p>

","<p>Using the simplest SSL/TLS (without PKI) as transport protection for REST is probably the most effective way to get the wheel right the first time.</p>

<p>Beside that, you should clarify a few topics. For instance:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Is it important that the client does not get deceived by an attacker which may be impersonating the server?</em> If it is, then you have to properly setup PKI so that the client can authenticate the server with a certificate. Alternatively you can use TLS-SRP.</li>
<li><em>Is it important that the server does not get deceived by an attacker which may be impersonating a real user?</em> If it is, then you have to setup an authentication scheme: for instance HTTP Digest, SSL client certificates, TLS-SRP, etc.</li>
<li><em>Is it important that a compromise at the client or server does not jeopardize data exchanged in previous sessions?</em> If it is, then you have to restrict the cipher suite to cipher that offer perfect forward secrecy (DHE).</li>
</ol>

<p>Only if you have troubles in setting up SSL you should consider rolling up your own protocol.</p>

"34054808","How to make Python Crypto AES faster","<p>I'm looking for a very fast way for encrypting and decrypting short text snippets. Security is secondary in my use-case. Light encryption with a constant IV is fine. I'm currently doing this:</p>

<pre><code>BS = 16
pad = lambda s: s + (BS - len(s) % BS) * chr(BS - len(s) % BS)
unpad = lambda s : s[:-ord(s[len(s)-1:])]

import base64
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

iv = '0123456789012345'
def encrypt(raw, key):
    raw = pad(raw)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    return base64.b64encode( cipher.encrypt( raw ) )

def decrypt(enc, key):
    enc = base64.b64decode(enc)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    return unpad(cipher.decrypt( enc ))

enc_text = encrypt('Hello World!','xyz1234567890abc')
print decrypt(enc_text, 'xyz1234567890abc')
</code></pre>

<p>How can I make this faster? Maybe by using another AES mode (MODE_CBC?), or is there a faster padding function, a faster way of hex-converting the output?</p>
","<p>Counter mode (<code>AES.MODE_CTR</code>) will be faster for multi-block messages, as it can be parallelized for both encryption and decryption. <code>CBC</code> is serial on encryption because the resulting output of each block-cipher operation is fed as input to be <code>XOR</code> with the plaintext of the next block before encrypting. Because <code>CTR</code> generates a keystream by encrypting each (sequential) counter value with the key, it does not rely on the output of any previous block operation and can perform the tasks in parallel. </p>

<p>In addition, because <code>CTR</code> operates as a stream cipher, no message padding is required, so you'll save time on that operation in and out. </p>

<p><strong>Note: Don't re-use counters. You mentioned that confidentiality is a secondary concern here, but while re-using IVs in CBC mode is ""bad"", re-using counters in CTR mode is <em>end of the world</em> bad.</strong> Just use a <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/11362/12569"">sequential counter (literally <code>i++</code>) combined with 64 bits of the <code>ms since epoch start</code></a> and you'll be fine.

"43466737","What's the best way to verify XML signature in python?","<p>I'm trying to validate XML message signature with given public key in Python which is validated fine on a PHP code with openssl.</p>

<p>Here's PHP code that's working fine.</p>

<pre><code>$pubKey = openssl_pkey_get_public(file_get_contents(""public_key.pem""));

$xmlDoc = new DOMDocument();
$xmlDoc-&gt;load(""message.xml"");

$signedInfo=$xmlDoc-&gt;getElementsByTagName(""SignedInfo"")-&gt;item(0)-&gt;C14N(true, true);

$ok = openssl_verify($signedInfo, $signature, $pubKey, OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA1);
</code></pre>

<p>I've found different libraries in Python to achieve this but none of them are verifying fine. I've listed the libraries and the problems I've faced on. Is there any other preferred ways to achieve this?</p>

<p><strong>1. pyOpenSSL</strong></p>

<p>It fails with following message: [('rsa routines', 'INT_RSA_VERIFY', 'wrong signature length')]</p>

<pre><code>import OpenSSL.crypto as c
from StringIO import StringIO

<p><strong>2. M2Crypto</strong></p>

<p>Tried to install M2Crypto but it fails with cannot find openssl/err.h header file. So I've installed openssl 1.1.0e and copied lib and include directories to C:/pkg directory and it throws different error like:
SWIG/_m2crypto_wrap.c(3754) : error C2065: 'CRYPTO_NUM_LOCKS' : undeclared ident ifier
And found precompiled M2Crypto msi installer but during runtime it throws following error:
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.</p>

<p>This library seems outdated and not enough documentation available.</p>

<p><strong>3. signxml</strong></p>

<p>So far it's the only library that works partially for me.
Xml verification works fine but it throws error on sign: ValueError: Could not unserialize key data.</p>

<pre><code>from xml.etree import ElementTree
from signxml import XMLSigner, XMLVerifier
from myapp import settings

cert = open(settings.STATIC_ROOT + '/file/public.cert', 'rt').read()
key = open(settings.STATIC_ROOT + '/file/public.key', 'rt').read()

root = ElementTree.fromstring('&lt;xml1&gt;12&lt;/xml1&gt;')
signed_root = XMLSigner().sign(root, key=key, cert=cert)
verified_data = XMLVerifier().verify(signed_root).signed_xml
print verified_data
</code></pre>
","<p>The answer to the question in the title is <code>signxml</code>.</p>

<p>It is the library designed for the stated purpose. <code>PyOpenSSL</code> and <code>M2Crypto</code> operate on lower-level objects than XML signature; verifying the latter would involve canonicalizing XML, digesting proper parts of it, and comparing the provided signature over the digest. While possible, this is not trivial and provides much space for errors. For example in your code for <code>PyOpenSSL</code> you do not base64-decode the signature value.</p>

<p>With <code>signxml</code>, your example is mostly correct. For verification of the signature, you do not need the private key, so the error you get is not relevant to the question. You should in general read the certificate and the key in binary, not text mode (<code>open(filename, ""rb"")</code>) - even if the files are PEM-encoded.</p>

<p>The following is a working example:</p>

<pre><code>from xml.etree import ElementTree
from signxml import XMLSigner, XMLVerifier

cert = open(""cert.pem"", ""rb"").read()
key = open(""key.pem"", ""rb"").read()

xml_obj = ElementTree.fromstring(""&lt;Example/&gt;"")
signed_xml_obj = XMLSigner().sign(xml_obj, key=key)
XMLVerifier().verify(signed_xml_obj, x509_cert=cert)
</code></pre>

<p>If your XML object has been serialized and de-serialized after signing, this simplest code might be not enough; the (complicated) details are described <a href=""https://technotes.shemyak.com/posts/xml-signatures-with-python-elementtree/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

","<p>The most often used solution is to write some ""magic"" string at the beginning of the encrypted file followed by the encrypted content. If that string is found when reading the file, further encryption is refused. For decription it is read to veryfiy that this is a file we encrypted, but otherwise it is ignored.</p>

<p>Imagine you're using ""MyCrYpT"" as the magic (although it doesn't matter <em>what</em> you use as long as it is reasonably unique.</p>

"23254181","DES Encryption and decryption of hex using hex key python","<p>How can I encrypt and decrypt hex text using 8 byte hex key using DES algorithm in python?</p>

<p>I have a hex text <code>0x3a3456abcd4ff5cd</code> to encrypt with hex keys so how can I convert these values to equivalent strings so that I can use existing libraries to work with them.</p>

<p>Here's what I've tried, but it represents 8 byte key to equivalent 13 byte string:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import DES
text =(unichr(4).decode('utf-8')*8).encode('utf-8')

key1=(unichr(0x46)+unichr(0xb2)+unichr(0xc8)+unichr(0xb6)+unichr(0x28)+unichr(0x18)+unichr(0xf8)+unichr(0x84)).encode('utf-8')

key2=(unichr(0x4a)+unichr(0x5a)+unichr(0xa8)+unichr(0xd0)+unichr(0xba)+unichr(0x30)+unichr(0x58)+unichr(0x5a)).encode('utf-8')

des = DES.new(key1,DES.MODE_ECB)
cipher_text = des.encrypt(plain_text)
print 'the cipher text is ', cipher_text

des = DES.new(key2,DES.MODE_ECB)
print 'the decrypted text is: ', des.decrypt(cipher_text)
</code></pre>
","<p>To use the two keys in your example, assign them like this:</p>

<pre><code>key1 = '\x46\xb2\xc8\xb6\x28\x18\xf8\x84'

key2 = '\x4a\x5a\xa8\xd0\xba\x30\x58\x5a'
</code></pre>

<p>block_size is a variable of AESCipher and set to 16.
Apparently it can't be changed</p>

<p>Am i right?</p>
","<p>Presumably there is no way to do this, because AES specifies a block size of 128 bits (16 bytes). Note that the <em>key size</em> is different and can vary (128, 192, or 256 bits).</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://wiki.crypto.rub.de/Buch/download/Understanding-Cryptography-Chapter4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Understanding Cryptography, chapter 4.2, Overview of the AES Algorithm</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The AES cipher is almost identical to the block cipher Rijndael. The
  Rijndael block and key size vary between 128, 192 and 256 bits.
  However, the AES standard only calls for a block size of 128 bits.
  Hence, only Rijndael with a block length of 128 bits is known as the
  AES algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want a variant that has another block size but is otherwise identical, you should be looking at implementations of Rijndael, not AES.</p>

<p>Note that the test case provides two sets of keys for Alice and Bob, the first generated by OpenSSL and the second generated by PyCrypto (uncomment the section 'Alternate keys').</p>

<p>The test case is a simple round trip:</p>

<ol>
<li>Alice generates a symmetric key and encrypts the data</li>
<li>Alice encrypts the symmetric key with Bob's public key, then signs the encrypted key with her private key (hashes are not used in this simple test case).</li>
<li>Bob verifies the signature with Alice's public key and decrypts the
symmetric key with his private key.</li>
<li>Bob decrypts the data with the symmetric key.</li>

<p>Is there any reason why PyCrypto seems to be such a basket case?</p>
","<p>First, I would consider the cases where the OpenSSL keys are used. The most important fact is that Bob's RSA modulus (<code>bn</code>) is slightly smaller than Alice's RSA modulus (<code>an</code>).</p>

<p>The error <code>Ciphertext too big</code> shows up at the ""sender"" (that is, within the <code>generation</code> function). The ciphertext you ""sign"" is guaranteed
to be smaller than <code>an</code> (because encryption is computed modulo <code>an</code>) but it may sometimes (due to the plaintext being random) happen to be larger than <code>bn</code>. In that case, signature is not possible.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the check is performed and an exception is raised only if you have the GMP library installed, which is often the case on Linux systems.
On Windows, it is difficult to install such library, and pycrypto relies on pure python code. The exception will be not be raised in that case (though it should, the two versions should behave in the same way), and you will silently get the wrong value as signature (<code>Bad signature</code>).</p>

<p>The error <code>AES key must be either 16, 24, or 32 bytes long</code> shows up when your random AES
key starts with <code>0x00</code>. Since the RSA primitive converts the byte string into an integer, the leading zero will lost in the process, and you will get back that error at the receiving end.</p>

<p>If you generate RSA keys on the fly, in 50% of the cases <code>bn&gt;an</code> and you will see fewer errors.</p>

<p>I am not able to understand why 100% of the tests fail on Linux with OpenSSL keys, but I guess there is a similar reason to explain that.</p>

<p>In general (and this holds also for all other crypto libraries), the root cause of all problems is that you are using the <em>raw</em> RSA mechanisms. Beside considerations
about limitations and correct way to use the API, you have a big security hole. Some form of secure padding must <strong>always</strong> be used, otherwise an attacker can easily break your scheme.</p>

<p>In PyCrypto, proper protocols are available via the PKCS#1 modules for both <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.Signature-module.html"" rel=""nofollow"">RSA signatures</a> and <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEP-module.html"" rel=""nofollow"">RSA encryption</a>. However, mind that signature must be done on the message hash (e.g. SHA1), and encryption on a payload which is considerably smaller than the RSA modulus.</p>

","<p><strong>Solution:</strong> exporting/importing keys using <code>exportKey()</code> and <code>importKey()</code></p>

<p><strong>Why your conversion does not work</strong></p>

<p>Converting the key to a string using <code>str()</code> does not work, as you can see from the example below.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; k = RSA.generate(1024)
&gt;&gt;&gt; pk = k.publickey()
&gt;&gt;&gt; str(pk)
'&lt;_RSAobj @0x10e518908 n(1024),e&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see from the example above, the function <code>str()</code> just returns the string <code>'&lt;_RSAobj @0x10e518908 n(1024),e&gt;'</code> which does not show the actual key.</p>

<p><strong>Converting the key object into a string</strong></p>

<p>A good way to convert the key into a string is to export it using a standard format, for example the well-known PEM format, as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; pkstring = pk.exportKey(""PEM"")
&gt;&gt;&gt; pkstring
'-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQC4SD0YSMWYAU27mFVKsHgtKWzM\n9jfvs2Xl+zCQpAHNtvYWTo6mnyWTwH4lGn7ulYdGx5gAJj6OlWg+CKoHXqPOh6e4\nP8DM97dM9QfP8d7el2ZCz1+5oMd8iQo+WPTM1qa5TMj9rZMpwAnSrS490LW6ZpTL\n7fChg3APljnspQ/7nQIDAQAB\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----'
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the string returned by <code>pk.exportKey(""PEM"")</code> corresponds to the <em>actual</em> key.</p>

<p><strong>Converting the string back to a key object</strong></p>

<p>This is also very easy, you can just type:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; importedpk = RSA.importKey(pkstring)
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can use the <code>encrypt</code> method with the <code>importedpk</code> key which has been converted from the string <code>pkstring</code>.</p>

<p>To prove you that <code>importedpk</code> has been loaded correctly, just type the following two commands on the python interpreter.</p>

<pre><code>pk.encrypt(""Hello"", 12)
importedpk.encrypt(""Hello"", 12)
</code></pre>

<p>They should return the same output. In particular, if you type</p>

<pre><code>pk.encrypt(""Hello"", 12) == importedpk.encrypt(""Hello"", 12)
</code></pre>

<p>the result should be</p>

<pre><code>True
</code></pre>

<p><strong>How to fix your code</strong></p>

<p>In server code, replace</p>

<pre><code>if c.send(str(public_key)):
  print ""Public Key Sent""
</code></pre>

<p>with</p>

<pre><code>if c.send(public_key.exportKey(""PEM"")):
  print ""Public Key Sent""
</code></pre>

<p>In client code, replace</p>

<pre><code>public_key = s.recv(1024)
</code></pre>

<p>with</p>

<pre><code>public_key = RSA.importKey(s.recv(1024))

<p>Now although the above produces a very similar output but it is not the right one. Why? Because when the output of the java code above is sent to the backend, I receive a HTTP 200 OK and the expected response. </p>

<p>However, when the output of the python code above is sent similarly to the backend, I receive a 500 internal server error, meaning (as per my assumption, given that all the other params, headers etc. remain exactly the same between the java and the python HTTP requests) the input to the backend was not correct and hence it broke (again please ignore the 500, I agree it should be something more meaningful and definitely not a 500)</p>

<p><strong>I do not have access to the backend. It is more of a red team - blue team exercise we are doing</strong></p>

<p>Also, I could possibly invoke the java code above from python and still manage to achieve the end result and get the work done, but that'd be more of a hack, which would although be sufficient, but I am more interested in knowing how exactly can I achieve the same with Python alone.</p>

<p>As per some suggestions in the comments below I tried this as well:
So I tried this as well:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_v1_5

def encryptMsg(secret):
    message = secret
    key = RSA.importKey(open('myPubkey.pem').read())
    cipher = PKCS1_v1_5.new(key)
    ciphertext = b64encode(cipher.encrypt(message))
    return ciphertext
</code></pre>

<p>and then in the while loop, this:</p>

<pre><code>localStringBuilder1 = localStringBuilder1 + encryptMsg(str(localObject)) + ':::'
</code></pre>

<p>Still doesn't seem to work. Same results as before.</p>

","<p>The problem is in deserializing the signature tuple.</p>

<p>Instead of doing this:</p>

<pre><code>signature_tuple = signature.split("","")

<pre><code>AES_Encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr, block_size=32)
</code></pre>

<p>but then I get the following error</p>

<pre><code>'block_size' is an invalid keyword argument for this function
</code></pre>

<p>If someone could point me towards the right direction that'd be great.</p>
","<p>AES is a block cipher with a fixed block size of 128 bit (16 byte). It has three valid key sizes of 128 bit, 192 bit and 256 bit. A nonce for CTR mode, also called IV sometimes, needs to be <em>at most</em> as long as the block size which is 16 bytes. </p>

<p>If you want a 256 bit block size, you can't use AES. There are several other algorithms that permit a 256 bit block size such as Rijndael, but there is no implementation of that in pycrypto. AES is a subset of Rijndael.</p>

<p>Usually, we generate a nonce of either 64 bit or 96 bit for CTR mode in order to have some control over how many blocks we can encryption without a counter collision.</p>

<pre><code>nonce = Random.get_random_bytes(8)  # 8 bytes
ctr = Counter.new(64, nonce)        # 64 bits remaining
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>nonce = Random.get_random_bytes(12) # 12 bytes
ctr = Counter.new(32, nonce)        # 32 bits remaining
</code></pre>

<p>For a 64 bit nonce, you can encrypt at most 2<sup>64</sup> blocks before running into problems. That's more than any data in the world, but the issue is that by choosing the nonce at random, you have a probability of 1 to get a nonce collision after 2<sup>32</sup> encryptions with the same key due to the birthday paradox.<br>
For 96 bit nonces, you can encryption at most 2<sup>32</sup> blocks which is roughly 68 GB of data, but you have a much lower chance of getting a nonce collision.</p>

<p>The nonce is not secret, so you can send it along with the ciphertext. Usually, it is simply prepended to the ciphertext and sliced off before decryption. Since you know how long it is supposed to be, you know how much you can slice off.</p>

<p>, but that doesn't seem to be doing anything at all. I don't even know where to begin on the decryption part because again, I need to be able to access the decrypted file without storing it to the hard drive.</p>

<p>Thanks guys.</p>
","<p>How about using <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/library/stringio.html"" rel=""nofollow"">StringIO</a> instead of an actual disc file called <code>out_filename</code>? </p>

<p>Just use a virtual disc with the same structure.  </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>import StringIO

f=StringIO.StringIO()

for line in ['line {}\n'.format(i) for i in range(25)]:
    f.write(line)

f.seek(0)

for line in f:
    print line.strip() 
</code></pre>

<p>So you would need to replace <code>with open(out_filename, 'w') as outfile: ...</code> with a call to <code>outfile=StringIO.StringIO()</code> and the rest should be the same.</p>

<p>Like so:</p>

<pre><code>with open(in_filename, 'r') as infile:
    outfile=StringIO.StringIO()
    outfile.write(struct.pack('&lt;Q', filesize))
    outfile.write(iv)

    while True:
        chunk = infile.read(chunksize)
        if len(chunk) == 0:
            break
        elif len(chunk) % 16 != 0:
            chunk += ' ' * (16 - len(chunk) % 16)

        outfile.write(encryptor.encrypt(chunk))

","<p>DISCLAIMER: I'm <strong>extremely</strong> new to Python, but try this:<br/><br/>
Try changing</p>

<pre><code>key = key[:16]

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>key = key + bytes([0,0,0,0])
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you a 24 byte key which, I think, should work.</p>

<p>DCP allows any length of key whereas Crypto insists on keys of 16, 24 or 32 bytes. By default DCP will use SHA1 to generate the key, which is then 20 bytes long. Based on this DCP uses logic for keylength &lt;= 24 and just zero pads the key rather than logic for keylength &lt;= 16 which is the effect that key[:16] is having. </p>

<p>Also, don't know if this is just a typo but try changing the AES mode</p>

<pre><code>cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
</code></pre>

<p>That will give a decryption of your input. But then you'll need to consider padding of the original source text because DCP does not pad (I think) but Crypto requires multiples of 16 for decryption.</p>

","<p>If you need to add padding to make the plaintext a multiple of 16 bytes, the extra bytes need to be stripped before you write the decrypted data. This means you will need to somehow include the number of pad bytes added with the padding before you encrypt it. See PKCS#7 for one possible technique. There are a number of other schemes as well.</p>

I followed the <a href=""http://blog.victorjabur.com/2011/06/05/compiling-python-2-7-modules-on-windows-32-and-64-using-msvc-2008-express/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""following"">following</a> directions for PyCrypto but instead tried to compile the winrandom source. </p>
","<p>Since pycrypto is part of the <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries27"" rel=""nofollow"">third-party libraries for Google App Engine</a>, it should not be necessary to manually install pycrypto to use it in your project. Instead, you need to add the library to your app.yaml:</p>

","<p>I don't have direct experience with CryptoJS, but many years of experience with a variety of other crypto libraries.  It's almost certainly the case the CryptoJS.AES.decrypt expects a different ciphertext format than the one you're using.  Your ciphertext is the contanenation of two separate Base64-encoded entities:</p>

<p>Base64(IV) + Base64(Enc(Message))</p>

<p>If CryptoJS.AES.decrypt expects the IV to be specified as part of the ciphertext (which it may not), and expects Base64-encoded ciphertext input at all (which it may not), then I would try passing:</p>

<p>Base64( (binary IV) + (binary Enc(Message)) )</p>

<p>Looking at the CryptoJS doc, I share your frustration with it.  But there's an encryption example with ""manually specified IV"" that may provide a clue.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/aes.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(""Message"", key, { iv: iv });

","<p>I ran into this problem as well and unfortunately it was very tricky to get <code>pycrypto</code> to talk to <code>crypto-js</code>.  Here are the combination that worked for me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use <code>MODE_CFB</code> with <code>segment_size=128</code> when encrypting in Python</li>
<li>You must pad your string with Pkcs7 as per RFC 2315 [Page 21]</li>
<li>Once you have received the base64 version of ciphertext in JS, you need to wrap it in
<code>CryptoJS.lib.CipherParams.create({ ... })</code></li>

<p>But I need output <code>S1NaeUFaUHdqc20rQWM1L2ZVMDJudz09</code> which will PHP decrypt to <code>secret</code>. How to modify Python code to get expected output?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.hash.php"" rel=""nofollow"">PHP's <code>hash</code></a> outputs a Hex-encoded string by default, but Python's <code>.digest()</code> returns <code>bytes</code>. You probably wanted to use <code>.hexdigest()</code>:</p>

<p>The idea of the initialization vector (IV) is to provide randomization for the encryption with the same key. If you use the same IV, an attacker may be able to deduce that you send the same message twice. This can be considered as a broken protocol.</p>

<p>The IV is not supposed to be secret, so you can simply send it along with the ciphertext. It is common to prepend it to the ciphertext during encryption and slice it off before decryption.</p>

","<p>So one way is to keep track of which numbers you have already given out and keep handing out new random numbers one at a time, consider</p>

<pre><code>import random
random.seed(0)

class RandomDeck:
      def __init__(self):
           self.usedNumbers = set()

      def draw(self):
          number = random.randint(0,2**32)

<p>As you can see we essentially have a deck of random numbers between 0 and 2^32 but we only store the numbers we have given out to ensure we don't have repeats. Then you can re-shuffle the deck by forgetting all the numbers you have already given out.</p>

<p>This should be efficient in most use cases as long as you don't draw ~1 million numbers without a reshuffle.</p>

<p>Is there any way to pull this off? Is this a feasible goal at all?</p>
","<p>If you have a continuous range of numbers, you don't need to store them at all. It is easy to devise a bidirectional mapping between the value in a shuffled list and its position in that list. The idea is to use a pseudo-random permutation and this is exactly what <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">block ciphers</a> provide. </p>

<p>The trick is to find a block cipher that matches exactly your requirement of 32-bit integers. There are very few such block ciphers, but the <em>Simon</em> and <em>Speck</em> ciphers (released by the NSA) are parameterisable and support a block size of 32-bit (usually block sizes are much larger).</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/inmcm/Simon_Speck_Ciphers/tree/master/Python"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This library</a> seems to provide an implementation of that. We can devise the following functions:</p>

<pre><code>def get_value_from_index(key, i):
    cipher = SpeckCipher(key, mode='ECB', key_size=64, block_size=32)
    return cipher.encrypt(i)

def get_index_from_value(key, val):
    cipher = SpeckCipher(key, mode='ECB', key_size=64, block_size=32)
    return cipher.decrypt(val)
</code></pre>

<p>The library works with Python's big integers, so you might not even need to encode them. </p>

<p>A 64-bit key (for example <code>0x123456789ABCDEF0</code>) is not much. You could use a similar construction that increased the key size in DES to Triple DES. Keep in mind that keys should be chosen randomly and they have to be constant if you want determinism.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you don't want to use an algorithm by the NSA for that, I would understand. There are others, but I can't find them now. The Hasty Pudding cipher is even more flexible, but I don't know if there is an implementation of that for Python.</p>

<p><strong>Design considerations</strong><br>
While Garrigan Stafford's answer is perfectly fine, the memory footprint of this solution is much smaller (a bit more than 4 GB). Another difference between our answers is that Garrigan's algorithm takes more time to generate a random number when the amount of generated numbers increases (because he keeps iterating until an unused number is found). This algorithm just looks up the next unused number if a certain number is already used. This makes the time it takes to draw a number every time practically the same, regardless of how far the pool of free numbers is exhausted.</p>

","<p>As <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/1084416/peter-wood"">Peter Wood</a> commented previously, the issue is the end-of-line format.</p>

<p>I'm working on a project using python 2.7 in CentOS, and I've got a publickey from a website, which gave me the above error.</p>

<p>The problem was that it came with \r\n end of line sequence, which made the python-jose library jwt.decode call to pyCripto library fail. </p>

<p>My fix was to just remove '\r' character before returning the response this way:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;pre&gt;
response = get(url).content
return response.replace('\r', '')
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>And this made the thing work at last. Hope this help!</p>

<p>But it's cryptographically wrong in many ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>The key looks like 32 character hex string (which would encode a 128-bit key), but you actually need to treat it as ASCII encoding a 32-byte key. That's wrong, since keys are supposed to be uniformly distributed binary string</li>
<li>Similarly an IV is supposed to be a uniform binary, but it's actually ASCII</li>
<li>The IV is fixed, but the whole point of an IV is to be different (unpredictably random for CBC mode) for <em>each message</em>.</li>
<li>CBC mode is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, which allow an active attacker to recover the plaintext if they can execute a chosen ciphertext attack where they learn which ciphertext decrypt successfully.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should use authenticated encryption with unique IVs instead.</p>

At the Python side, you must use the same padding scheme to verify the signature; that can be achieved with PyCrypto's PKCS#1 v1.5 signature module (<a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_v1_5-module.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_v1_5</a>).</p>

<p>The second problem is the one you point out: the <code>verify</code> method of an RSA PyCrypto object
oddly requires the signature to be encoded as an integer. However, by using the module I mentioned above, the problem will go away, since it accepts byte strings.</p>

","<p>Your code is fine. PKCS#1 v1.5 padding in pyCrypto is randomized (<a href=""https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/blob/v2.6.1/lib/Crypto/Cipher/PKCS1_v1_5.py#L135"" rel=""nofollow"">source</a>).

<p>If you want to check compatibility between pyCrypto and PHP's OpenSSL extension, then you would need to encrypt in one, decrypt in the other and check that you got what you expected.</p>

<p>PKCS#1 v1.5 padding should not be used nowadays, because there are efficient attacks against it. OAEP is a much better alternative.</p>

There is little to no documentation on the exact options that CommonCrypto uses, so I'm needing some help figuring out what options to set in PyCrypto.</p>

<p>Specifically, my CommonCrypto decryption setup call is:</p>

<pre><code>CCCryptorCreateWithMode(kCCDecrypt, kCCModeCFB, kCCAlgorithmAES128, ccDefaultPadding, NULL, key, keyLength, NULL, 0, 0, 0, &amp;mAESKey);

<p>My primary questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Since there is both a kCCModeCFB and kCCModeCFB8, what is CommonCrypto's definition of CFB mode - what segment size, etc?</li>
<li>What block size is the CommonCrypto AES128 using?  16 or 128?</li>
<li>What is the default padding, and does it even matter in CFB mode?</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently, the first 4 bytes of data is decrypting successfully with PyCrypto *as long as I set the segment_size to 16*.</p>

<p>Ideas?</p>
","<p>Without knowing CommonCrypto or PyCrypto, some partial answers:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>AES (in all three variants) has a block size of 128 bits, which are 16 bytes.</p></li>
<li><p>CFB (cipher feedback mode) would actually also work without padding (i.e. with a partial last block), since for each
block the ciphertext is created as the XOR of plaintext with some keystream block, which only depends on previous blocks.
(You still can use any padding you want.)</p>

<p>If you can experiment with some known data, first have a look at the ciphertext size. If it is not a multiple of a
full block (and the same as the plaintext + IV), then it is quite likely no padding.</p>

<p>Otherwise, decrypt it with noPadding mode, have a look at the result, and compare with the different known padding modes.</p>

<p>From a <a href=""http://opensource.apple.com/source/CommonCrypto/CommonCrypto-55010/Source/CommonCryptoSPI/CommonCryptorSPI.h"" rel=""nofollow"">glance at the source code</a>, it might be PKCS#5-padding.</p></li>
<li><p>CFB8 is a variant of CFB which uses only the top 8 bits (= one byte) of each block cipher call output (which takes the
previous 128 bits (= 16 bytes) of ciphertext (or IV) as input). This needs 16 times as many block cipher calls, but
allows partial sending of a stream without having to worry about block boundaries.</p></li>
<li><p>There is another definition of CFB which includes a <em>segment size</em> - here the segment size is the number of
bits (or bytes) to be used from each cipher output. In this definition, the ""plain"" CFB would have a segment size of 128 bits (= 16 bytes), CFB8 would have a segment size of 8 bits (one byte).</p></li>

"22132775","Combining WinCrypt & PyCrypto Encryption","<p>I'm writing a native-C program which (among others) handles encryption/decryption of data. The data is processed (before or after execution) using a python script, whose main purpose is to encrypt/decrypt the data (and perhaps do some additional parsing of it).</p>

<p>I'm having problems in decrypting the data generated by WinCrypt API, using PyCrypto API, and vice-versa. Specifically I've experienced this problem in AES-256 based encryption. Both sides of the encryption/decryption scheme run on the same machine, and are provided the same encryption key. They are both CBC based and (if the documentation is not lying) are initialized with a 0-based initialization vector. However, no matter what I try to do, they don't seem to get along. The resulting data (encrypted using WinCrypt &amp; decrypted using PyCrypto or vice versa) is all messed up (not even close to the original). Just to be clear - each of the mechanisms works on its own (decrypting WinCrypt-encrypted data using WinCrypt works perfectly, and the same for PyCrypto).</p>

<p>The native encryption code is based on WinCrypt's examples. It generally looks like the following code:</p>

<pre><code>HCRYPTPROV hCryptProv;
HCRYPTKEY hKey;
HCRYPTHASH hHash;
CHAR szPassword[PASSWORD_LENGTH] = """";
DWORD dwLength;
PBYTE pbBuffer = NULL;   
DWORD dwBufferLen; 
DWORD dwCount; 

CryptAcquireContext(&amp;hCryptProv, NULL, NULL, PROV_RSA_AES, 0);
CryptCreateHash(hCryptProv, CALG_MD5, 0, 0, &amp;hHash);
CryptHashData(hHash, (BYTE *)szPassword, dwLength, 0);
CryptDeriveKey(hCryptProv, CALG_AES_256, hHash, 0, &amp;hKey);

CryptEncrypt(hKey, NULL, FALSE, 0, pbBuffer, &amp;dwCount, dwBufferLen);
CryptDecrypt(hKey, 0, FALSE, 0, pbBuffer, &amp;dwCount);
</code></pre>

<p>(This is just a general scheme, and obviously the actual code contains all the necessary error handling, handles cleanup, etc).</p>

<p>First, I did an encryption by openssl as following:</p>

<pre><code>openssl enc -aes-128-ctr -in input.mp4 -out output.openssl.mp4 -K 7842f0a1ebc38f44e3e0c81943f68582 -iv d01f40dfc8ec8cd9

<p>And then, I tried to do the same thing through PyCrypto:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util import Counter
key = '7842f0a1ebc38f44e3e0c81943f68582'
iv = 'd01f40dfc8ec8cd9'

ctr_e = Counter.new(128, initial_value=int(iv, 16))
encryptor = AES.new(key.decode('hex'), AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr_e)

with open('output.pycrypto.mp4', 'wb') as fout:
    with open('input.mp4', 'rb') as fin:
        fout.write(encryptor.encrypt(fin.read()))
</code></pre>

<p>I assume they are supposed to be similar, but it is not:</p>

<pre><code>diff output.openssl.mp4 output.pycrypto.mp4
Binary files output.openssl.mp4 and output.pycrypto.mp4 differ
</code></pre>
","<p>OpenSSL behaves as expected (fortunately, as documentation to this fact is missing for the command line) and uses the given IV as leftmost bytes of a big endian counter. In other words, the bytes given are the <em>most significant</em> part of the 16 byte counter. The code in the question uses the IV as initial counter value, i.e. it is interpreted as the <em>least significant</em> part of the counter.</p>

<p>Now it took me some time to fix the Python code as there are two problems with the <code>Counter</code> class I had to work around:</p>

<ul>
<li>the size of the counter should be 64 bit instead of 128 bit if a prefix of 8 bytes is used; this is a design feature, but it may cause overflow if the amount of bits reserved for the counter is small (it's OK with the current setting of 64 bit though)</li>
<li>the default initial counter value is set to 1 while CTR mode always starts counting at 0; this is likely an off-by-one bug in the Counter design</li>
</ul>

<p>So without further ado:</p>

from Crypto.Util import Counter

key = '7842f0a1ebc38f44e3e0c81943f68582'.decode('hex')
iv = 'd01f40dfc8ec8cd9'.decode('hex')

ctr_e = Counter.new(64, prefix=iv, initial_value=0)
encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr_e)

with open('output.pycrypto.mp4', 'wb') as fout:

<p>This will print 127 (normally it would be 128 for 1024 bits key), and I don't know why.</p>
","<p>You are not using a correct encryption scheme. From the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even though you may choose to directly use the methods of an RSA key object to perform the primitive cryptographic operations (e.g. <code>_RSAobj.encrypt</code>), it is recommended to use one of the standardized schemes instead (like <code>Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_v1_5</code> or <code>Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_v1_5</code>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>although nowadays the more modern/safe <code>Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEP</code> should be preferred over <code>Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_v1_5</code>.</p>

<p>If you use one of these schemes then the output will always be 128 bytes. The reason for that is that PKCS#1 specifies a function called I2OSP, which converts the result of the modular exponentiation (which is a number bounded by the modulus/the key size) to a static number of octets, the key size to be exact.</p>

<p>The output of the direct encrypt function is what is called raw or textbook RSA: just modular exponentiation. This will just return the number, which may have leading zero bits. How many depends on chance, (somewhat) on the value of the modulus and if signed or unsigned encoding is used.</p>

"48601182","PyCryptodome RSA signature and verification","<p>I am working on a program which transfers data over the internet in python using the socket module. I am now trying to implement encryption using the pycryptodome module. I am using Salsa20 to transfer normal messages and to transfer the Salsa20 key I am using RSA. The problem is that the code is raising a ValueError when verifying the hash. This is the protocol:</p>

<ol>
<li>The client connects to the server (and generates a Salsa20 key)</li>
<li>The server generates an RSA key pair and sends the public key to the client</li>
<li>The client generates its own key pair and sends the public key</li>
<li>The client encrypts the Salsa20 key with the public key</li>
<li>The client signs and sends a hash of the encrypted Salsa20 key</li>
<li>The client sends the encrypted Salsa20 key</li>
<li>The server hashes the unsigned encrypted key, and verifies that it is the same as the signed one (this is the line where the problem happens)</li>
<li>The server decrypts the unsigned key</li>
</ol>

<p>I have checked and printed repeatedly, and the hashes are the same. The sockets are not the problem.</p>

","<p>I have done this using <code>openpgp2pem</code> from <a href=""http://web.monkeysphere.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">Monkeysphere</a>.</p>

<p>First, get the key's ID by doing:</p>

<pre><code>gpg --list-secret-keys
</code></pre>

<p>Note the 8-digit hexadecimal ID of the key. E.g. 0123ABCD</p>

<h3>Public key</h3>

<p>To get a public key:</p>

<pre><code>gpg --export --no-armor 0123ABCD | openpgp2pem 0123ABCD
</code></pre>

<h3>Secret key</h3>

<p>To get a secret key using <code>openpgp2pem</code>, unfortunately the GPG key must have its passphrase removed. Do this by:</p>

<pre><code>gpg --edit-key 0123ABCD
</code></pre>

<p>Then use the <code>passwd</code> command to remove its passphrase. (You could do this on a copy of the original GPG homedir, and use the gpg <code>--homedir</code> option to operate on the temporary copy.)</p>

<p>Then after that you can do:</p>

<pre><code>gpg --export-secret-keys --no-armor 0123ABCD | openpgp2pem 0123ABCD
</code></pre>

<h3>Convert PEM for use by Python</h3>

<p>In practice, I've found that the secret key so generated can be directly used in PyCrypto using:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

with open('secret-key.pem', 'rb') as f:
    key_secret = RSA.importKey(f.read())
</code></pre>

<p>However, the public key generated above could not be directly used with PyCrypto (it's missing something). I had to generate a PyCrypto-compatible PEM as follows:</p>

<pre><code>from base64 import b64encode, b64decode
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

def publicpem2pycrypto(public_pem):
    public_64 = public_pem.replace(b""-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----"", b"""").replace(b""-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----"", b"""")
    pub_der = b64decode(public_64)
    key_pub = RSA.importKey(pub_der)
    key_public_export = key_pub.exportKey('PEM')
    print(key_public_export.decode('ascii'))
    with open('public-key.pem', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(key_public_export)
    print(""Saved to public-key.pem"")
</code></pre>

<p>Or, it could be generated from the secret key as follows. Also, the following allows a passphrase to be added back on to the secret key:</p>

<pre><code>from base64 import b64encode, b64decode
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

def secretpem2pycrypto(out_secret_filename, out_public_filename, secret_pem, passphrase=None):
    secret_64 = secret_pem.replace(b""-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"", b"""").replace(b""-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"", b"""")
    secret_64 = secret_64.replace(b""\n"", b"""")
    #print(secret_64)
    secret_der = b64decode(secret_64)
    #print(b64encode(secret_der))
    key_secret = RSA.importKey(secret_der)
    key_secret_export = key_secret.exportKey('PEM', passphrase=passphrase)
    key_public_export = key_secret.publickey().exportKey('PEM')
    print(key_secret_export.decode('ascii'))
    with open(out_secret_filename, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(key_secret_export)
    print(""Saved to "" + out_secret_filename)
    if True:
        print()
        print(key_public_export.decode('ascii'))
        with open(out_public_filename, 'wb') as f:
            f.write(key_public_export)
        print(""Saved to "" + out_public_filename)
</code></pre>

<p>Once the secret key has a passphrase added, it can be used via:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

with open('secret-key.pem', 'rb') as f:
    key_secret = RSA.importKey(f.read(), passphrase=""xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"")

The Problem here is, that PyCrypto has problems to decrypt the encrypted string</p>

<p>This part encrypts the string:</p>

<pre><code>var encrypted = new JSEncrypt();
encrypted.setPublicKey(key); // key == '-----BEGIN PUBLIC'.....
encrypted = encrypted.encrypt('test');

<p>This part should decrypt it:</p>

<pre><code>private_rsa_key = open('rsa_1024_priv.pem', 'r').read()
rsa_key = RSA.importKey(private_rsa_key)
decrypted = rsa_key.decrypt(b64decode(encrypted_string))

<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AIIw5.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AIIw5.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The correct string is always being placed at the end, but i need to get rid of the part before it.</p>

<p>For testing purposes I tried encrypting the String in Python, using this code:</p>

<pre><code>public_rsa_key = open('rsa_1024_pub.pem', 'r').read()
rsa_key = RSA.importKey(public_rsa_key)
encrypted = rsa_key.encrypt('test', 'x')

","<p>As Java defaults to <code>""PKCS#5Padding""</code> it is pretty safe to assume you have to deal with those padding bytes (one to blocksize - in this case 16 - bytes are <em>always</em> padded). The Java <code>""PKCS#5Padding""</code> padding mode is actually PKCS#7 padding, as PKCS#5 only specifies padding for 8 byte blocks (e.g. DES mode encryption).</p>

<p>So this means you have to look for PKCS#5 padding or PKCS#7 padding. A quick search shows <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/13893208/589259"">this answer</a>.</p>

","<p>If you want to preserve the length, then you want to use a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher"" rel=""nofollow"">stream cipher</a></p>

I saw using PyCrypto I can encrypt the entire file, but I want to encrypt just the password, because other fields are subjected to future changes. </p>
","<p>I get this question a lot when doing security consulting. No best practice, but it's all about managing the risk.</p>

<p>Storing credentials in user config file (e.g. <code>~/.secret</code> or <code>~/.config</code>) is a common practice. You can set file permission to <code>0600</code> so no other user (except superusers) can read it.</p>

<p>Or, you can pass the credentials in the environment. Best if you do it from remote connection (<a href=""https://superuser.com/a/163228"">SSH</a>), but you have to manually login and pass the variables every time you restart the application.</p>

<p>Also make sure the database user has very limited privilege.</p>

However, wile the first verification will always return true, once the data is written to files and then loaded again, the verification usually fails, but is sometimes successful.</p>

<p>Even when the code fails, The outputs of the two <code>print signature</code> and <code>print hash.hexdigest()</code> calls are visually identical.</p>

<p>My test code  is:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Hash import SHA256

    seed_file = open(""Seed"")

    plaintext = seed_file.read()

    hash = SHA256.new(plaintext)
    signer = PKCS1_PSS.new(private_key)
    signature =  signer.sign(hash)

    plaintext_file = open(""plaintext"", 'w')
    plaintext_file.write(plaintext)

    file.write(private_key.exportKey())

    file.write(private_key.publickey().exportKey())

def create_seed():
    file = open(""Seed"", 'w')
    file.write(""Test"")
</code></pre>
","<p>I notice two problems with your code.</p>

<p>First, you are writing arbitrary binary data to a file what was opened for text:</p>

<pre><code>signature_file = open(""signature"", 'w')  #bad

</code></pre>

<p>should be:</p>

<pre><code>signature_file = open(""signature"", 'wb')  #good
signature_file.write(signature)

<p>Second, you never close your files. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>with open(""signature"", 'wb') as signature_file:
    signature_file.write(signature)

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES

<pre><code>eric@eric-Latitude-E5400 ~ $ dpkg -L udev | xargs grep urandom

<p>So it looks like my permissions are fine. I have also tried running the development server as root, but I get the same error. For some reason this only happens with the development server, and not when deployed to google's cloud. Any ideas on what to try next?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>The error you are getting is because GAE restricts file access, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random#Linux"" rel=""nofollow"">/dev/urandom</a> is blocked.</p>

<p>Note that the error is not when you import PyCrypto, it's when you do <code>AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)</code></p>

<p>You can fix it, either by editing <code>Crypto/Random/OSRNG/__init__.py</code>  and moving the lines</p>

<pre><code>if hasattr(os, 'urandom'):
    from Crypto.Random.OSRNG.fallback import new
</code></pre>

<p>to the top, or by modifying os.name to something different than posix or nt, at the beginning of your script. I suggest the first option.</p>

<p>ps: I assume you are using python 2.5 and pycrypto 2.2, because of your Traceback. Next time please include these details.</p>

<p>I'm trying to end up with what's in <code>xrsa</code>, but using Python. I installed pycrypto, and I'm looking at the documentation, but I'm still missing something obvious. First, the RSA.construct from Crypto.PublicKey only takes six parameters, but not the exponents one and two (DP and DQ). Also, the inputs need to be longs. In the C# code, the values were 128 and 64 bytes long, as opposed to a 4 byte long. </p>

<p>edit: also, the ""message"" to be encrypted is a sha1 hash of 0x118 bytes of the file, which contains meta data and a hash of other parts of the file.</p>

<p>edit: Thank you so much mata, I feel I'm closer to getting it working. It still doesn't match the C# signature. In C#, the signature format is being set as SHA1. What is this doing, and can it be done in Python?</p>
","<p>ok, first: long in python is not 4 byte. in python, long has no predefined size, so using a long to store a 128byte number is no problem.
to convert a bytestring to long you can use:</p>

<pre><code>long_value = long(string_value.decode('hex'), 16)
# maybe someone knows a better way?
</code></pre>

<p>couldn't it be that the file is in DER form? in that case you simply could simple read the file using:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
with open(""keyfile"", ""rb"") as f:
    key = RSA.importKey(f.read())
</code></pre>

<p>if not, it would probably be best to convert it to PEM or DER, so you don't have to read in the parameters yourself.
anyway, the last three parameters in <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.PublicKey.RSA-module.html#construct"" rel=""nofollow"">RSA.construct</a> are optional, specially <code>u</code> can be calculated as <code>1/p % q (where p &gt; q)</code>.
at least from what i've tried, it works even if you only specify the first three parameters.</p>

","<p>In your decryption routine you use:</p>

<pre><code> unhexed.split('|')
</code></pre>

<p>to find the boundary between IV and the ciphertext. However, the IV is generated randomly by the sender. Sometimes, one of its 16 bytes will be 124, that is the boundary character '|'.</p>

<p>When that happens (in roughly 6% of the cases), the decryption routine will initialize the cipher either with</p>

<ul>
<li>an IV with length between 1 and 15 bytes, which leads to the exception, or</li>
<li>an IV with length 0, which leads to the incorrect decryption, because in PyCrypto versions&lt;2.6 an all-zero 16 byte IV will be used by default</li>
</ul>

<p>In the decryption routine you should have instead:</p>

<pre><code>components = [ unhexed[:AES.block_size], unhexed[AES.block_size+1:] ]

","<p>As it stands there is no way for us to really critique your code per se.  However to re-use logins, my recommendation is to simply hit the same routines that Django uses, porting them to a new language or framework as necessary.  This means you have a single point of authority regarding security.</p>

<p>Note you cannot use SHA hashed passwords (any algorithm) with PostgreSQL per se because PostgreSQL stores the passwords as md5 hashes salted with the username.  Unless you have access to the unhashed username you cannot alter the PostgreSQL user account effectively.   You might however be able to write a function which both changes the PostgreSQL and Django password from the same inputs but you need to be careful about statement logging.  Also note that ALTER USER is not parameterized in PostgreSQL so you end up having to use pl/pgsql and do something like:</p>

<p>However, I need to use Python in the later stages of the project and consequently need to decrypt my data using it. I tried employing PyCrypto but it tells me the key length must be 16, 24 or 32 bytes long, which is not the case.

Simply extending the length of the string with 6 spaces is not working.</p>

","<p>I strongly recommend you adjust your PHP code to use (at least) a sixteen byte key, otherwise your crypto system is considerably weaker than it might otherwise be.</p>

<p>I would also recommend you switch to CBC-mode, as ECB-mode may reveal patterns in your input data. Ensure you use a random IV each time you encrypt and store this with the ciphertext.</p>

"45649856","pycrypto encrypt/decrypt, losing part of encrypted string when decrypting","<p>I am trying to encrypt/decrypt with pycrypto in python. for the most part things have worked smooth but I am getting an odd problem when decrypting data.I have tried to encrypt/decrypt some jpgs for testing and although they encrypt/decrypt without issue, the decrypted files cannot be opened/are corrupted. To try to find the problem I saved a textfile with a random sentence similar to ""test this file for integrity blah blah blah"" and it decrypts correctly only after "".... integrity blah blah blah"", everything before integrity is still in garbled characters. I'm not that knowledgable on AES, but im assuming that this is an encoding/decoding or padding error. </p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>#encryption
iv = Random.new().read( AES.block_size)

filePath = input(""Path to file for encryption: "")
selFile = open(filePath, 'rb')
getBytes = bytes(selFile.read())

</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas on what could be causing the loss of the first characters, and preventing me from encrypting/decrypting files correctly?</p>
","<p>You're generating a new IV for encryption and decryption seperately, which comes to yield such problems. Here's what I recommend doing:</p>

<pre><code>def encrypt(inpath, outpath, password):
    iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
    with open(inpath, ""rb"") as f:
        contents = f.read()
    # A context manager automatically calls f.close()
    key = pbkdf2.crypt(password, """")
    # See notes

    aes = AES.new(key, AES.Mode_CFB, iv)
    encrypted = aes.encrypt(contents)
    with open(outpath, ""wb"") as f:
        f.write(iv + b"":"")
        f.write(encrypted)
    print(""Encryption successful"")


def decrypt(inpath, outpath, password):
    with open(inpath, ""rb"") as f:
        contents = f.read()

    iv, encrypted = contents.split(b"":"")
    key = pbkdf2.crypt(password, """")
    aes = AES.new(key, AES.Mode_CFB, iv)

    decrypted = aes.decrypt(contents)
    with open(outpath, ""wb"") as f:
        f.write(decrypted)
    print(""Decryption successful"")
</code></pre>

<p>Some notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An IV is not meant to be secret, so it can be randomly generated once and then written to a file to be used later for decryption (as shown in this example)</p></li>
<li><p>A hashing algorithm is not strong enough for deriving keys, which is why there are special tools called key derivation algorithms (like PBKDF2 in python). Use those instead!</p></li>

","<p>When you encrypt a file, its contents are run through an algorithm and the contents are changed. If your file is a JPEG, its headers are also changed causing it to look-like corrupt if you try to open it using file viewers.</p>

<p>However, what's happening behind the scenes is they have just been transformed from <code>X</code> to let's say <code>Y</code>. To bring it back and have your image viewer easily open it, you will need to run the file thorough a decryption algorithm using the appropriate keys. That way your <code>Y</code> type will be transformed back exactly to <code>X</code> type and you will be able to read it.</p>

<p>The code fails in the final check of the Verify function, outputting the error <code>Failed verification</code>. I've had a look at the Go PSS verification code and if anything goes wrong, a generic verification error is returned so it's not that helpful. Even if it was more specific, either there is a compatibility problem here, a bug in one of the language implementations, or my code is wrong.</p>

<p>Much thanks for any help.</p>
","<p>So it appears I misinterpreted <code>_SALT_SIZE</code> in the Python code. With some help from the TUF developers (i.e. they told me) I discovered <strong>PyCrypto's RSA PSS code infers the salt size to be equal to the size of the hash digest of the hashing algorithm in use</strong>. In this case it was 32 bytes as the hashing algorithm was Sha256. With just the change of <code>opts := rsa.PSSOptions{SaltLength: 32, Hash: crypto.SHA256}</code> the code works.</p>

"8261535","Decrypt a a middle chunk of data using pycrypto AES or other algorithm","<p>I was looking for a way to use an encryption algorithm from pycrypto package that allows me to encrypt an original LARGE piece of data, and then decrypt only a MIDDLE chunk of this data. In other words, start decrypting the data at a certain offset, instead of starting to decrypt it at offset 0.</p>

<p>I've tried AES, as you can see below. But, it only allows me to properly decrypt the data if I go from beg of the enrypted data to the part I really need to decrypt, instead of just decrypting a middle chunk of data (of course with the proper key), and skip decrypting parts before this middle chunk. This is important in saving time and processing power. Let's say you have an original data that is 4GB. At some point in time, you only need the data from offset 3GB-3.5GB. Decrypting a whole 2GB of data to get to the 1GB chunk that you need is a waste of time and resources...</p>

<p>Is this the nature of all encryption/decryption algorithms? Perhaps you can recommend something that does what I want? That works with a key and is pretty secure..</p>

<p>To avoid creating a process everytime you want to run your Python script, you can implement server-client architecture using <strong>sockets</strong> to communicate between Python and PHP. Server being your crypto library in your case and client is your PHP script that queries the server.</p>

<p>How to check the password error during decrypt?</p>
","<p><s>AES by itself cannot check if the key is ""correct"". It is simply a pure function that transforms some bytes to some other bytes.</p>

<p>To achieve what you want, you need to implement it yourself. One way to do is to add a fixed header (like 16 bytes of zero) to the plaintext before encryption. Upon decryption, check and discard the said header if it matches or raise an error if the header mismatches.</p>

<p>A side note: you are doing encryption without any authentication, which is probably insecure.</s></p>

<h1>Edit</h1>

<p>First of all, you should add authentication. Encryption without authentication easily leads to many security flaws, many not obvious to the untrained. Especially since you are using AES in CBC mode, you may open yourself to padding oracle attacks without authentication.</p>

<p>When you do authenticated encryption the right way (encrypt-then-mac), you will get an authentication error if the user input the wrong password. If you want to further distinguish a wrong password from tampered data, you have to devise your own method, like prepending a ciphertext of magic number.</p>

","<p><code>Rfc2898DeriveBytes</code> is a streaming-response object, so concatenating two successive calls is the same as doing one call with both lengths added together.</p>

<pre><code>var pbkdf2WithTwoCalls = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(...)
var pbkdf2WithOneCall = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(sameParametersAsAbove);

byte[] twoCallA = pbkdf2WithTwoCalls.GetBytes(32);
byte[] twoCallB = pbkdf2WithTwoCalls.GetBytes(16);

byte[] oneCall = pbkdf2WithOneCall.GetBytes(32 + 16);

if (!oneCall.SequenceEquals(twoCallA.Concat(twoCallB))
    throw new TheUniverseMakesNoSenseException();
</code></pre>

<p>So your solution in Python would be to make one 48-byte call to PBKDF2, then split it into the 32-byte AES key and the 16-byte IV.</p>

<p>Your decryption response indicates that the key is correct, but the IV is not.</p>

<p>I get that AES is a block cipher algorithm. However, how should I fix my PHP code so that it generates ""padded"" cipher, any clues?</p>
","<p>The main issue here is that you're using different key-size. PHP's <code>openssl_encrypt</code> determines the key size from the encryption algorithm string  (<code>""aes-256-cbc""</code> in this case) so it expects a 256 bit key. If the key is shorter it is padded with zero bytes, so the actual key used by <code>openssl_encrypt</code> is:  </p>

<pre><code>""akshayakshayaksh\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0""
</code></pre>

<p>Pycryptodome determines the key size from the actual size of the key, so your Python code uses AES-128-CBC. Also, as mentioned in the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54176838/encrypt-text-in-php-and-decrypt-in-python#comment95183977_54176838"">coments</a> by kelalaka, the ciphertext is base64 encoded (<code>openssl_encrypt</code> base64-encodes the ciphertext by default - we can get raw bytes if we use <code>OPENSSL_RAW_DATA</code> in <code>$options</code>). Pycryptodome doesn't decode the ciphertext, so we must use <code>b64decode()</code>.  </p>

<pre><code>key = b'akshayakshayaksh\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0'
obj2 = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, b'0123456789012345')
ciphertext = b""cUXDhOEGz19QEo9XDvMzXkGFmg/YQUnXEqKVpfYtUGo=""
print(obj2.decrypt(b64decode(ciphertext)))
#b'message to be encrypted\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'
</code></pre>

<p>The extra <code>\t</code> characters at the end is the padding - CBC requires padding. Pycryptodome doesn't remove padding automatically but it provides padding functions in <code>Crypto.Util.Padding</code>.  </p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import unpad
from base64 import b64decode

key = b'akshayakshayaksh\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0'
obj2 = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, b'0123456789012345')
ciphertext = b""cUXDhOEGz19QEo9XDvMzXkGFmg/YQUnXEqKVpfYtUGo=""
plaintext = obj2.decrypt(b64decode(ciphertext))
plaintext = unpad(plaintext, AES.block_size)
</code></pre>

<hr> 

<p>Although PHP's openssl accepts arbitrary sized keys, it's best to use key size specified in the algorithm string, to prevent confusion at the very least. Also the key bytes should be as random as possible.  </p>

<p>As noted by Maarten Bodewes in the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54176838/encrypt-text-in-php-and-decrypt-in-python#comment95192652_54179062"">comments</a> this key uses a limited range of bytes and so it's very weak. Furthermore it is created by repeating a word and that makes it vulnerable to dictionary attacks (which are much faster than bruteforce attacks).  </p>

<p>In PHP we can get cryptographically secure random bytes with <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.random-bytes.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>random_bytes()</code></a>, </p>

<pre><code>$key = random_bytes(32);  
</code></pre>

<p>and in Python with <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.urandom"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>os.urandom()</code></a></p>

<pre><code>key = os.urandom(32)
</code></pre>

<p>(You can use the same functions to create the IV; you shouldn't use a static IV, the IV must be unpredictable)  </p>

<p>You could also derive a key from your password with a KDF. In this case it is important to use a random salt and a high enough number of iterations. PHP provies a PBKDF2 algorithm with the <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.hash-pbkdf2.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>hash_pbkdf2</code></a> function, and Python with <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac</code></a>.</p>

<p>Finally, I have to guarantee that the message containing those credentials, as well as the user data , maintain its integrity. Therefore, in the client side, I am signing this data with the user's private key.</p>

<p>I send the data, as well as the signature, both in ArrayBuffer type to the server, encoded in base64. </p>

<pre><code>function signData(private_key, data, callback){

    var dataForHash = str2ab(JSON.stringify(sortObject(data)));
    computeSHA(dataForHash, ""SHA-256"", function(hash){

    return btoa(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, new Uint8Array(this)));
};
</code></pre>

<p>Afterwards, when the Python Server receives this http request, it decodes data and signature from base64. </p>

<pre><code>dataForHash = base64.b64decode(dataReceived['data'])
signature = base64.b64decode(dataReceived['signature'])
</code></pre>

<p>For validating the signature, the public key is needed. Consequently:</p>

<pre><code>data = utils.byteify(json.loads(dataForHash.decode(""utf-16"")))
pub_key = base64.b64decode(data['pub_key']) # Get PEM Public Key
</code></pre>

<p>(utils.byteify() converts unicode string to regular strings)</p>

<p>Verifying signature:</p>

<pre><code>Authentication.verifySignature(signature, dataForHash, pub_key)
</code></pre>

<p>Method definition:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Signature import PKCS1_v1_5
from Crypto.Hash import SHA256
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

def verifySignature(signature, data, pub_key):
    key = RSA.importKey(pub_key)
    h = SHA256.new(data)
    verifier = PKCS1_v1_5.new(key)
    return verifier.verify(h, signature)
</code></pre>

<p>However, the signature verification returns False. I have also tried to use the m2crypto library, but it returns 0. </p>
","<p>I managed to find the problem.</p>

<p>Although in Python (PyCrypto) the sign function should receive the hash of the data to sign, using the Web Cryptography API, the sign method applies a hash function to the received data before signing it. </p>

<p>Consequently, the data in JS was being hashed twice, one before invoking the sign method and one in the sign method, before creating the signature.</p>

<pre><code>function signData(private_key, data, callback){

    var dataForHash = str2ab(JSON.stringify(sortObject(data)));

    signRSA(private_key, dataForHash, function(data){           

        callback(data.buffer.b64encode(), dataForHash.b64encode());
    });    
}

ArrayBuffer.prototype.b64encode = function(){
    return btoa(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, new Uint8Array(this)));

String.prototype.b64decode = function(){
    var binary_string = window.atob(this);

    var bytes = new Uint8Array(new ArrayBuffer(len));
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; len; i++)        {
        bytes[i] = binary_string.charCodeAt(i);
    }
    return bytes;
};
</code></pre>

<p>For small strings, like ""hello world!"", the encryption/decryption works fine.</p>

<p>But I would like to extend the encryption to text files of any reasonable size, but I've been running into this error:</p>

<p><code>ValueError: Input strings must be a multiple of 16 in length</code></p>

<p>I understand that this is because AES-256 is a block cipher, and so the texts need to be in multiples of 16 bytes, and if bytes are big, then I need to chunk them.</p>

<p>My question is, how do I exactly go about doing that? Is there a built-in <code>pycrypto</code> method for it? I'm quite new to cryptography, so I don't think I'd be able to write a chunking method on my own.</p>

<p>Now, I am trying to decrypt that encrypted file using the decrypt processor in Apache NiFi and I am not sure which <code>KDF</code> and <code>Encryption Algorithm</code> to select.</p>

<p>I do not see anything termed <code>RSA</code> in the <code>Configure Processor</code> window of Apache NiFi.</p>
","<p>Currently, the <code>EncryptContent</code> processor does not support arbitrary RSA decryption. I would suggest you <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">file a Jira</a> requesting this enhancement (don't be scared by the graph showing a discrepancy between opened &amp; closed; we're currently at the phase of the lifecycle where a release went out recently and now all the feedback is generating new tickets for the next release). </p>

<p>For immediate solutions, I have a few suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can use GPG to encrypt and decrypt the data, and NiFi provides first-class support for GPG decryption. The GPG key uses an underlying DSA/RSA key alongside AES encryption for the data, so this would be effectively the same process (asymmetric encryption). </li>
<li>You can use the <a href=""https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/components/org.apache.nifi.processors.script.ExecuteScript/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>ExecuteScript</code></a> processor to run a small script which performs the decryption. The processor supports Ruby, Groovy, Lua, Javascript, and Python*. Unfortunately the limitation on Python is that Jython doesn't support native libraries (such as pycrypto). One possible solution is to use <a href=""https://github.com/Stewori/JyNI"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JyNI</a> which allows Jython to load CPython libraries, but I have not evaluated it in this context. If you are comfortable with Groovy &amp; BouncyCastle or Ruby &amp; OpenSSL, you can write the decrypt script in either of those languages with only a few lines of code. </li>
<li>If you really want to use the Python code you already have, you can invoke it on the command-line via <a href=""https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/components/org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.ExecuteProcess/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>ExecuteProcess</code></a> or <a href=""https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/components/org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.ExecuteStreamCommand/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>ExecuteStreamCommand</code></a>. </li>
</ul>

<p>One outstanding question -- how are you using RSA to encrypt the files? RSA with a 2048 bit key length can only encrypt 245 bytes. If you are encrypting files, it is more likely you would want to use a hybrid cryptosystem, where you encrypt the arbitrary data with a randomly-generated AES key and then encrypt just that AES key with RSA. This will be much faster as well. This is the model used by SSL, S/MIME, OpenPGP, etc. </p>

<li>Pycrypto requires the input to be multiple of 16 in length, m2crypto does not.</li>

","<p>Please make sure that you understand about <a href=""/questions/tagged/character-encoding"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;character-encoding&#39;"" rel=""tag"">character-encoding</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/encoding"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;encoding&#39;"" rel=""tag"">encoding</a>.</p>

<p>Character encoding defines what text looks like if you represent it as bytes. There are many encoding standards, but the most common ones include ASCII, Windows-1252, UTF-8 and UTF-16. The first one is a limited single (7-bit) set, Windows-1252 contains mostly European/Latin characters and the latter two are encodings used for Unicode text. If a file is viewed in the wrong encoding then it may show like nonsense - but most text editors can guess the text encoding pretty well nowadays.</p>

<p>Note that not all - and sometimes even many - bytes can be interpreted as text in most encodings. Bytes may not represent a character at all, or it may encode (or encode part of) a control-character. It is possible to go around this issue by encoding your bytes as text. A common encoding uses hexadecimals. Each byte is encoded in exactly two characters, 4 bits per character. This makes it easy for programmers to see the contents of the bytes. Base64 on the other hand is not that legible as it encodes each 6 bits as a character. So base 64 is a more efficient encoding, but it is not very easy for humans to read.</p>

<p>Make sure you use a good character-encoding if you want your plaintext input to be legible. The ciphertext - despite the name - consists of bytes. If you want to create characters from that, use base 64.</p>

"48595705","Cant encrypt strings with special characters with pycrypto AES","<h1>Description</h1>

<p>I want to store people's names in MySQL database. Because the data is sensitive information i want to encrypt it with AES. I am using <code>PyCrypto AES</code> module.
The code that I am using is:</p>

<pre><code>class AESCipher(object):

    def __init__(self, key):
        self.bs = 64
        self.key = hashlib.sha256(key.encode()).digest()

    def encrypt(self, raw):
        raw = self._pad(raw)
        iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
        cipher = AES.new(self.key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
        return base64.b64encode(iv + cipher.encrypt(raw))

    def decrypt(self, enc):
        enc = base64.b64decode(enc)
        iv = enc[:AES.block_size]
        cipher = AES.new(self.key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
        return self._unpad(cipher.decrypt(enc[AES.block_size:])).decode('utf-8')

    def _pad(self, s):
        return s + (self.bs - len(s) % self.bs) * chr(self.bs - len(s) % self.bs)

    @staticmethod
    def _unpad(s):
        return s[:-ord(s[len(s)-1:])]

operator = AESCipher(data_encryption_key)
</code></pre>

<p>The key used for encryption is a random long string.</p>

<h1>Problem</h1>

<p>Lets say the string (example name) i want to encrypt is ""Strah"". I get the folowing cipher text.</p>

<pre><code>b'kA/Q5snPUHltzh3Kl8QMH/uTpfcjdXtvrx0JUrGv2tk+P86ERfkv0eTBV5j6MThkKplLLcn4f1Ei4Q1gT/FcVx+PhEnqczKhuvLzrLHYlQ4='
</code></pre>

<p>But if the name includes some special characters like č,š or ž and i want to encrypt a name like ""Štrah"" i will get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>ValueError: Input strings must be a multiple of 16 in length
</code></pre>

<p>So the question is, what should I do to encrypt strings with special characters.</p>
","<p>The problem here is that the cipher internally operates on bytes, but you're giving it a string. You're padding the string to a multiple of 16, but when that string is encoded to bytes, it's no longer a multiple a 16.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; text = 'Štrah'
&gt;&gt;&gt; padded = AESCipher('')._pad(raw)
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(padded)
64
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(padded.encode('utf8'))
65
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>The solution is to encode the string yourself instead of letting the cipher do it for you. You have to make 2 small changes:</p>

<pre><code>def encrypt(self, raw):
    raw = raw.encode('utf8')  # encode to bytes here
    raw = self._pad(raw)
    iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
    cipher = AES.new(self.key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    return base64.b64encode(iv + cipher.encrypt(raw))

def _pad(self, s):
    # pad with bytes instead of str
    return s + (self.bs - len(s) % self.bs) * \
           chr(self.bs - len(s) % self.bs).encode('utf8')

<p>So I'm using mode.openPGP, but I can't seem to encrypt anything using a public key. My public key is well over the 16byte limit they specify (and any generation I've seen is over this limit as well). Is there a different value I'm supposed to use here, like the fingerprint ID? </p>

<p>I'm trying to read the contents of a file, encrypt it with a key, then print it into a new file to be sent (both will be deleted later on).
My code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>iv = CryptoRandom.new().read(CAST.block_size)
cipher = CAST.new(public_key, CAST.MODE_OPENPGP, iv)
file = open(filename)
contents = ''.join(file.readlines())
encrypted_contents = cipher.encrypt(contents)

","<p>I think you may be misunderstanding the algorithm you're using here. <code>CAST</code> is a symmetric-key algorithm, but whilst this implementation has an ""OpenPGP mode"", that doesn't mean that you simply pass your public key to it.</p>

<p>You should be generating a unique 16 byte key and passing that to <code>CAST.new()</code>. You would then generally encrypt <em>that</em> randomly-generated key using the public-key, and store/transmit the cipher text, and encrypted random-key together. The decryption process would decrypt the random-key using the private-key, then use the decrypted random-key to decrypt the cipher text.</p>

<p>1) Why are you using an ancient version of Python?  Install Python 2.7 and be happier!</p>

<p>2) assuming you're unfortunately stuck with 2.4 for some unknown reason... it appears that Python is unable to find any of the binary extension module (.pyd) files that came with the hashlib package you installed.  Did you compile your own hashlib or install a binary version?
If so, make sure the _hashlib.pyd file is put somewhere in the PYTHONPATH or sys.path.</p>

<p>I haven't had a windows installer with precompiled binaries for hashlib up on <a href=""http://code.krypto.org/python/hashlib"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.krypto.org/python/hashlib</a> in years as I lack the ability to build and test it... and Python 2.4 is so old that I assume anyone with the ability to install a binary on their system can just install a modern version of Python itself.</p>

","<p>This string ""xVF79DzOplxBTMCwAx+hoeDJhyhifPZEoACQJcFhrXA="" is a base64-encoded value.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64</a></p>

<p>Base64 encoding is widely used lots of applications, it's a good way to encode binary data into text.  If you're looking at a long encoded value, the ""="" at the end can be a good indicator of base64 encoding.  </p>

<p>In your python code you probably need to base64 decode the data before handing it to the decryption function.</p>

<p>I have two recommendations:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If crypto isn't a comfort zone for you, consult with someone who is good in this area for your project.</p></li>
<li><p>Be aware that embedding a symmetric encryption key in an Android app that you distribute is a bad idea.  Anyone that can get a copy of your app can extract that key and use it to decrypt or spoof your messages. </p></li>

<p>So question is, how does python's AES implementation works with HALF_BLOCK/8 key size and java's not?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>The nonce (the ""left side"" of the IV; the ""right"" being the sequential counter) should be transported alongside the cipher text as the IV. There is no need to keep the nonce secret. It just <strong>must not</strong> be re-used for another message encrypted by the same key.  </p>

<p>It appears the Python code is generating a new <code>Counter</code> which is <code>64</code> bits long and sets the <code>prefix</code> (I'm assuming the <code>nonce</code> value) to be the first <code>8</code> bytes of the <code>salt</code> variable. It likely (huge assumption here because I don't have access to the Python code) starts the actual <strong>counter</strong> value at <code>0x00</code> * 8, so your initial IV would be:</p>

<pre><code>salt = '#Eg����' # =&gt; UTF-8 encoding of 0x0123456789ABCDEF (not familiar enough with Python for the actual expression)
# Really may be misunderstanding, but as the AES IV must be 16 bytes, I imagine the terminology here is prefix = 8 bytes, sequence = 8 bytes
counter = Counter.new(HALF_BLOCK, prefix=salt[:HALF_BLOCK]) # =&gt; '0x01234567 89ABCDEF 00000000 00000000'
# Perform one encryption
counter # =&gt; '0x01234567 89ABCDEF 00000000 00000001'
# etc.
</code></pre>

<p>To perform the same operation in Java, it should be as simple as initializing your <code>IvParameterSpec</code> to the same as above (i.e. right-pad the first 8 bytes of the salt with <code>0</code> to 16 bytes).</p>

<pre><code>// Intentionally verbose for demonstration; this can obviously be compacted
byte[] salt = org.bouncycastle.util.encoders.Hex.decode(""0123456789ABCDEF"");
byte[] nonceAndCounter = new byte[16];
System.arraycopy(salt, 0, nonceAndCounter, 0, ((int) (HALF_BLOCK / 8)));
IvParameterSpec iv = new IvParameterSpec(nonceAndCounter);
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a full test case which asserts that the encrypt and decrypt are internally compatible; you could also run this with data from the Python side to verify. </p>

<pre><code>    @Test

<p>Why is that when im only slicing bit strings of that size? It should not limit the string length.

"2798998","using crypto++ on iphone sdk with pycrypto on app engine","<p>I'm trying to encrypt http requests using crypto++ and decrypt them with pycrypto on the app engine server end. Using Arc4 encryption, I can successfully encrypt and decrypt on the iphone end but when I try decrypting on app engine, the result is garbled.  The ciphertext after encrypting on the client is the same as the text received on the server when I check logging, so if they are visually the same, why would decrypting fail? </p>

<p>I thought maybe it has something to do with the encoding of the NSString, as I find I need to call encode() on the cipher on the server end before decrypting just to avoid decrypt() failing on it attempting to encode the cipher in ascii. I have a separate post that delves a bit into this. Can anyone offer some advice?</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2794942/crypto-pycrypto-with-google-app-engine"">crypto++ / pycrypto with google app engine</a></p>

<p>Update:
I have discovered that the ciphertext resulting from encrypting in C with Crypto++ is not the same as the ciphertext from encrypting in python with PyCrypto.  Could there be something I'm doing wrong with initializing the keys?  I do something like:</p>

<pre><code>    ARC4::Encryption enc(""a"");
</code></pre>

<p>in C. And in python I do:</p>

<pre><code>testobj=ARC4.new('a')
</code></pre>

<p>The %-encoded resulting cipher is different in C than in python.  I noticed that in C, I can pass a 2nd parameter for keylength, which I guessed should be 1 for ""a"", resulting in a different cipher than when putting no parameter.  The %-encoded result was still different from the python encoding, though.</p>

<p>Does anything look particularly amiss with my init perhaps?</p>
","<p>I've discovered that the problem was not with the init of either crypto impl but rather mistakenly trying to stuff the encrypted cipher text into an NSString which cant simply take raw binary data with no particular encoding. The trick was to encode the data in base64 or base16 so that it is is readable, then use unhexlify on the server end before decrypting. </p>

","<p>It seems like PyCrypto does not provide PKCS#7 padding / unpadding (as it should). So you should implement this using <code>data = data[:-data[-1]]</code>. So you should perform this on variable <code>c</code> directly after the call to <code>decrypt</code>.</p>

<p>You could check all the (in this case 7) padding bytes, but if you want to protect against invalid ciphertext, you should really add a MAC (HMAC) instead.</p>

<p>I believe that I can complete the Diffie-Hellman key exchange in Python, as I can generate the same public and private keys without error. I've based my Diffie-Hellman key exchange on <a href=""https://github.com/lowazo/pyDHE/blob/master/DiffieHellman.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this repository</a>.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to test this, however as I can't seem to get the shared secret exported from the C++ code (similar to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/87694/im-using-wincrypt-for-diffie-hellman-can-i-export-the-shared-secret-in-plain"">this thread</a>, that was never satisfactorily answered). I can however get the RC4 session key with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>// Get the key length
DWORD keylen;
CryptExportKey(   
    hSessionKey1,
    NULL,    
    PLAINTEXTKEYBLOB,
    0,
    NULL,
    &amp;keylen);

// Get the session key
CryptExportKey(   
    hSessionKey1,
    NULL,     
    PLAINTEXTKEYBLOB,   
    0,  
    encKey,    
    &amp;keylen);
</code></pre>

<p>The output from this function gets me:</p>

<pre><code>08 02 00 00 01 68 00 00 10 00 00 00 75 2c 59 8c 6e e0 8c 9f ed 30 17 7e 9d a5 85 2b
</code></pre>

<p>I know there is a 12 byte header+length on this, so that leaves me with the following 16 byte RC4 session key:</p>

<pre><code>75 2c 59 8c 6e e0 8c 9f ed 30 17 7e 9d a5 85 2b
</code></pre>

<p>So I am currently trying to validate that I can encrypt the same plaintext using the RC4 that I have acquired from the <code>CryptExportKey</code>. I am currently trying to encrypt <code>g_rgbData</code> from the C++ code above, which is set to:</p>

<pre><code>BYTE g_rgbData[] = {0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08};
</code></pre>

<p>With the C++ code I get the following encrypted output:</p>

<pre><code>cc 94 aa ec 86 6e a8 26
</code></pre>

<p>Using pycrypto I have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import ARC4
key = '75 2c 59 8c 6e e0 8c 9f ed 30 17 7e 9d a5 85 2b'
key = key.replace(' ', '').decode('hex')

plaintext = '0102030405060708'
plaintext = plaintext.replace(' ', '').decode('hex')

rc4 = ARC4.new(key)
encrypted = rc4.encrypt(plaintext)

print encrypted.encode('hex')
</code></pre>

<p>This results in the following output:</p>

<pre><code>00 5b 64 25 4e a5 62 e3
</code></pre>

<p>Which doesn't match the C++ output. I've played around with endianess, but I suspect something else might be going on. </p>

<p>Sorry if this is long winded, but it brings me to my two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Whenever you transition from the shared key to RC4 (using <code>CryptSetKeyParam</code> with <code>CALG_RC4</code>), what is actually going on under the hood here? I can't seem to find any information about this process anywhere so that I can implement it in Python.</p></li>
<li><p>Any idea why my RC4 will not work with the same key and the same plaintext in Python?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
","<p>According to the PyCrypto <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.Cipher.ARC4-module.html"" rel=""nofollow"">docs</a> your key must be minimum 40 bytes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>key (byte string) - The secret key to use in the symmetric cipher. It can have any length, <strong>with a minimum of 40 bytes</strong>. Its cryptograpic strength is always capped to 2048 bits (256 bytes).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but then there is a contradiction just above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>key_size = xrange(1, 257)</p>
  
  <p>Size of a key (in bytes)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>allowing key-lengths to be from 1-256, so I'm not sure if this even helps.</p>

<p>I believe that I can complete the Diffie-Hellman key exchange in Python, as I can generate the same public and private keys without error. I've based my Diffie-Hellman key exchange on <a href=""https://github.com/lowazo/pyDHE/blob/master/DiffieHellman.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this repository</a>.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to test this, however as I can't seem to get the shared secret exported from the C++ code (similar to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/87694/im-using-wincrypt-for-diffie-hellman-can-i-export-the-shared-secret-in-plain"">this thread</a>, that was never satisfactorily answered). I can however get the RC4 session key with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>// Get the key length
DWORD keylen;
CryptExportKey(   
    hSessionKey1,
    NULL,    
    PLAINTEXTKEYBLOB,
    0,
    NULL,
    &amp;keylen);

// Get the session key
CryptExportKey(   
    hSessionKey1,
    NULL,     
    PLAINTEXTKEYBLOB,   
    0,  
    encKey,    
    &amp;keylen);
</code></pre>

<p>The output from this function gets me:</p>

<pre><code>08 02 00 00 01 68 00 00 10 00 00 00 75 2c 59 8c 6e e0 8c 9f ed 30 17 7e 9d a5 85 2b
</code></pre>

<p>I know there is a 12 byte header+length on this, so that leaves me with the following 16 byte RC4 session key:</p>

<pre><code>75 2c 59 8c 6e e0 8c 9f ed 30 17 7e 9d a5 85 2b
</code></pre>

<p>So I am currently trying to validate that I can encrypt the same plaintext using the RC4 that I have acquired from the <code>CryptExportKey</code>. I am currently trying to encrypt <code>g_rgbData</code> from the C++ code above, which is set to:</p>

<pre><code>BYTE g_rgbData[] = {0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08};
</code></pre>

<p>With the C++ code I get the following encrypted output:</p>

<pre><code>cc 94 aa ec 86 6e a8 26
</code></pre>

<p>Using pycrypto I have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import ARC4
key = '75 2c 59 8c 6e e0 8c 9f ed 30 17 7e 9d a5 85 2b'
key = key.replace(' ', '').decode('hex')

plaintext = '0102030405060708'
plaintext = plaintext.replace(' ', '').decode('hex')

rc4 = ARC4.new(key)
encrypted = rc4.encrypt(plaintext)

print encrypted.encode('hex')
</code></pre>

<p>This results in the following output:</p>

<pre><code>00 5b 64 25 4e a5 62 e3
</code></pre>

<p>Which doesn't match the C++ output. I've played around with endianess, but I suspect something else might be going on. </p>

<p>Sorry if this is long winded, but it brings me to my two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Whenever you transition from the shared key to RC4 (using <code>CryptSetKeyParam</code> with <code>CALG_RC4</code>), what is actually going on under the hood here? I can't seem to find any information about this process anywhere so that I can implement it in Python.</p></li>
<li><p>Any idea why my RC4 will not work with the same key and the same plaintext in Python?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
","<p>Finally had some time to look over your code. When I run your code locally, I am able to export the session key and can use it successfully in pycrypto. My guess is that you are either not exporting the session key correctly (e.g. is what you posted what you are running?) or the data you are encrypting in C++ is not the same data that you are encrypting in Python - double check that the data you are encrypting is also correct. I suspect that it's probably the latter, as there isn't really much you can screw up with the <code>CryptExportKey</code> you've posted.</p>

"20390762","Python Crypto RSA textbook encryption versus openssl - what is it doing?","<p>I have an existing set of Python code that uses the primitive (textbook) RSA encryption mechanism to encrypt small pieces of data. Specifically, the python code loads a public key into variable publickey and then encrypts this data using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>ciphertext = publickey.encrypt(plaintext,None)
</code></pre>

<p>Yes I have read the disclaimer that ""this function performs the plain, primitive RSA encryption (textbook). In real applications, you always need to use proper cryptographic padding,..."" Unfortunately, I cannot change this code at the present time, so I am stuck with using this ""textbook"" encrypt command.</p>

<p>Note that even though this command does not use any padding scheme, it still seems to be able to encrypt any (appropriately small) amount of plaintext. In other words, the plaintext can be any length up to whatever limit is imposed by RSA.</p>

<p>Now however, I want to use the OPENSSL C library in an IOS app to do an identical RSA encryption. I cannot figure out how to do the exact same thing that the python function is doing. OPENSSL has a method RSA_public_encrypt where you pass in the size of the plaintext, the plaintext itself, an RSA object pointer which contains public key information, and the RSA padding mechanism. To replicate what python is doing in the crypto library, I thought I could use RSA_NO_PADDING as the padding mechanism. The problem is that OPENSSL states in their documentation that if you use RSA_NO_PADDING, then the length of the plaintext to encrypt must be EXACTLY equal to a certain value: RSA_Size(rsa) where rsa is a pointer to the RSA object passed in (the object that contains the public key).</p>

<p>In other words, the python crypto library seems to be able to encrypt variable length plaintext with no padding, but OPENSSL requires plaintext to be fixed length. So what exactly is the python crypto library doing to handle the variable size of the plaintext, and is there any way I can replicate this in OPENSSL?</p>
","<p>If you look at the documentation for <a href=""http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/RSA_public_encrypt.html#DESCRIPTION"" rel=""nofollow"">RSA_NO_PADDING</a>, they explain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This mode should only be used to implement cryptographically sound
  padding modes in the application code. Encrypting user data directly
  with RSA is insecure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, RSA_NO_PADDING is for cases where you're going to handle padding on your own, so OpenSSL expects an input of the proper size. It doesn't mean ""textbook RSA"". </p>

<p>Is there a compelling reason you can't change the python code? Textbook RSA is insecure and you're taking a great risk by using it. </p>

<p>Either way, you shouldn't be setting the IV once and reusing it multiple times. The IV is there to provide randomization of the ciphertexts so that attackers who observe the ciphertexts cannot determine whether the plaintext that is encrypted has repeated.</p>

<p>Moving AES object creation into the function, solves this issue:</p>

<pre><code>key = r'Sixteen byte key'  # Keep this real secret

def encode(role, plaintext):
    '''Encode the message, prefix with the role specifier'''
    iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
    msg = iv + cipher.encrypt(plaintext)
    msg = msg.encode('hex')
    msg = role + '-' + msg
    return msg


def decode(msg):
    '''Decode message, return role and plaintext'''
    role, msg = msg.split('-', 1)
    msg = msg.decode('hex')
    iv = msg[:AES.block_size]
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
    plaintext = cipher.decrypt(msg[AES.block_size:])
    return role, plaintext
</code></pre>

<p>You should check out the 2.7-alpha release of pyCrypto which includes authenticated modes such as GCM, EAX, SIV. Ciphertext authentication is important, because it might be possible to use a padding oracle attack in your system to decrypt any ciphertext.</p>

<p>the code is part of an attempt to encrypt whole folders but I am currently testing the encryption and the decryption of a single file. I left the IV simple and have not salted the hash for comfort reasons. 
for some reason this code does not digest and decrypt the encrypted file correctly. </p>

<p><strong>Also, as I am pretty new in this field I have a pretty basic question, why is IV so important?</strong></p>

<p>EDIT:
I mistakenly wrote decrypt instead of encrypt, now I fixed this it seems to manage to decrypt the file other than the first 16 bytes, does this have something to do with the IV(my guess due tot the fact the IV is 16 bytes long)?</p>

<p>EDIT 2:
Solved it by making the IV the first 16 bytes of the file instead of the same IV used for encoding, sorry for the hassle. Would love to get an answer on the reason and importance of the IV, if possible. thank you.</p>

<p>Here's the premise:
I have a python script that generates a ASN.1 encoded DER key.
I then have another python script that takes that DER private key and uses it to decrypt a base64 encoded string.
I'm currently attempting to convert that second script into its C# alternative, and I've got it working--to a point.</p>

<p>When using the original python scripts, the decrypted output is 127 bytes long, while the C# code I have is 16 bytes long. 
At this point I thought the C# code I had was completely wrong, until I noticed that the last 16 bytes of both the python output and the C# output are the exact same. WAT?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the output of the C# code is only 16 bytes long, however it directly matches the last 16 bytes of the python script. I'm not sure exactly what is going on, and my (basic) understanding of RSA tells me it should be an all or nothing function--the whole text gets decrypted, or I get gibberish.</p>
","<p>The issue here is padding. RSA operations require that the message be padded with a secure padding scheme before encryption. Otherwise, certain attacks exist that could recover the private key. Here's a good article explaining <a href=""http://rdist.root.org/2009/10/06/why-rsa-encryption-padding-is-critical/"" rel=""nofollow"">why</a>.</p>

<p>For some reason, the Python crypto library is not removing the padding for you, but the C# library is. So you'll have to remove the padding manually in the Python code.</p>

<p>Lucky for you, from the data you give, it looks like the padding scheme being used here is PKCS#1.5. That's a relatively simple padding scheme that will be easy to handle. The full specs are in RFC 3447, but it boils down to this:</p>

<pre><code>EM = 0x00 || 0x02 || PS || 0x00 || M.
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>EM</code> is the padded message before encryption, <code>PS</code> is the padding, and <code>M</code> is the original, unpadded message.</p>

<p>Here's a Python function that should do the job for you:</p>

<pre><code>def RemovePKCS15Padding( padded_msg ):
    if len(padded_msg) &lt; 2 or padded_msg[0]!='\x02':
        raise PaddingError # or whatever
    p = padded_msg.find('\x00')
    if p &lt; 0:
        raise PaddingError # or whatever
    return padded_msg[p+1:]

","<p>Apparently, you have 2 <em>Python3</em> instances installed:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Python3.6</em>:

<ul>
<li>Which is the one you want to use</li>
<li>Where <em>pycrypto</em> is installed (by <em>pip3</em>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Python3.5.2</em>:

<ul>
<li>Which is launched by <em>python3</em> command</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>So, you are launching the wrong <em>Python</em> interpreter, most likely because <em>python3</em> points to <em>/usr/bin/python3</em> (you can check that by typing <code>which python3</code> in your shell), which is <em>Python3.5.2</em>, and whose path is in the <em>${PATH}</em> env var.</p>

<p>From your <em>pip</em> paths, it seems like <em>Python3.6</em> is installed under <em>/usr/<strong>local</strong></em> (and the executable would be <em>/usr/local/bin/python3</em>), so you can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Launch the <em>Python3</em> executable by its full path (<strong><em>/usr/local/bin/python3</em></strong>, as stated above)</li>
<li>Add <em>/usr/local/bin</em> to <em>${PATH}</em> <strong>before</strong> <em>/usr/bin</em>, and then simply launch <em>Python3.6</em> by typing <code>python3</code> in your shell - <strong>but I'd advise against that</strong></li>
<li>There are other methods (e.g. creating an <em>alias</em>), but I guess you got the idea</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>@EDIT0</strong></em>:</p>

<p>Some more info as requested in comments. This has nothing to do with <em>Python</em>, it' all just <em>Ubtu</em> stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li>To list packages: use <em>apt</em> or <em>dpkg</em></li>
<li>To check <em>Python2.7</em> (or any other version): use <em>which</em> (as above)</li>
<li>You don't need to uninstall <em>Python3.5</em>. Multiple version can coexist safely</li>
<li>If you want to make one as default, make an alias (like I did at the end of the example below) and if you want it to be persistent, place it in your <em>profile</em> file (e.g. <em>.profile</em>, <em>.bashrc</em>, <em>.bash_profile</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples</strong> (on my <em>VM</em>):</p>

"48280670","Pycrypto: How to view raw RSA signature data?","<p>I'm working with a service that uses raw RSA with a private key to sign a payload. The data is effectively produced using:</p>

<pre><code>openssl rsautl -inkey private_key.pem -raw -sign
</code></pre>

<p>(Also, the result of encrypting with the private key)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in Pycrypto the corresponding <code>.verify()</code> method only takes an argument to verify the data against to return true or false.</p>

<p>In openssl, this could be achieved with one of the following:</p>

<pre><code># Private key based
openssl rsautl -inkey private_key.pem -raw -verify
# Public key based
openssl rsautl -inkey public_key.pem -pubin -raw -verify
</code></pre>

<p>How can I achieve the same functionality in Pycrypto?</p>

<p>(I understand the risks of raw RSA. A custom padding mechanism has been implemented to mitigate some of those risks. Unfortunately, it's not possible to change the current implementation)</p>
","<p>Delving into the <code>.verify()</code> method, one can find how Pycrypto builds the verification signature before comparing it to the given required signature.</p>

<p>It essentially uses Python's <code>pow()</code> method with the key's public (<em>e</em>) and the key's modulus (<em>n</em>). You will first need to pack the secret message into a (long) integer and then convert the result back to bytes. Fortunately, Pycrypto provides everything you need.</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Util import number

key = RSA.importKey(private_key_str, key_password_str)

# The message must be packed as a long first.
secret_message_long = number.bytes_to_long(secret_message_bytes)
# The magic!        
verify_long = pow(encrypted_session_key_long, key.e, key.n)
# and back to bytes
verify_bytes = number.long_to_bytes(result_long)

# Convert message back to a str (Unicode str in Py2).
# Replace 'utf-8' with the correct encoding for *your* message!!!!!

","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.pyinstaller.org/export/develop/project/doc/Manual.html?format=raw#listing-hidden-imports"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the pyinstaller manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can verify that hidden import is the problem by using Python's verbose imports flag. If the import messages say ""module not found"", but the warnproject.txt file has no ""no module named..."" message for the same module, then the problem is a hidden import.</p>
  
  <p>Hidden imports are handled by hooking the module (the one doing the hidden imports) at Analysis time. Do this as follows:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>Create a file named hook-module.py (where module is the fully-qualified Python name, eg, hook-xml.dom.py) and place it somewhere. Remember the place as your private hooks directory.</p></li>
  <li><p>In the .spec file, pass your private hooks directory as hookspath argument to Analysis so will be searched. Example:</p>
  
  <p>a = Analysis(['myscript.py'], hookspath='/my/priv/hooks') 
  In most cases the hook module will have only one line:</p>
  
  <p>hiddenimports = ['module1', 'module2']
  When the Analysis finds this file, it will proceed exactly as though the module explicitly imported module1 and module2.</p></li>

<p>Can anyone help me with this problem? I have used a Python 2 to 3 tool, but it still didn't work.</p>

<p>Also, could you please fix the directory problem? It isn't necessary, but I would like it.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I have replaced <code>str</code> with <code>bytes</code> and <code>bytearray</code> but it returns the same error.</p>
","<p>Your 'password' variable is a string, but <code>SHA256.new</code> expects bytes (to allow for unicode, for example). That you need bytes is listed in the <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.Hash.SHA256-module.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Crypto.Hash.SHA256 documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The solution is to encode the password to bytes before hashing. This is almost literally what the error message says (if you know that all strings in python 3 are unicode objects):</p>

<pre><code>TypeError: Unicode-objects must be encoded before hashing
</code></pre>

<p>The solution is for example to encode with utf8 :</p>

"12468835","Errors when including DES.pyd in python 2.6 solution","<p>I have installed Python 2.7 on my windows 7 x64 system with PyCrypto 2.5 compiled and built in. In my install path of <code>D:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\Crypto\Cipher</code> I see <code>DES.pyd</code>. I have opened it with dependency walker and ensured it had <code>initDES</code> as its only export.</p>

<p>What I wanted to do was copy/paste <code>DES.pyd</code> out now that it's built and use it in my code. So now I have my project folder <code>D:\project</code> containing <code>test.py</code> and <code>DES.pyd</code>.</p>

<p><code>test.py</code> contains the code:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.append(""D:\\project\\"")
import DES
print 'hi'
</code></pre>

<p>when running <code>test.py</code>, i receive the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""test.py"", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
    import DES
SystemError: dynamic module not initialized properly&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The purpose of this exercise is to be able to send <code>DES.pyd</code> and <code>test.py</code> to my friend without having them require to build and install pycrypto (a PITA). I fully understand my code above does absolutely nothing involving DES, the fact that it cannot import it is my main curiosity. Real code using DES will follow. </p>

<p>Also, if I import <code>DES.pyd</code> directly from the python path like <code>from Crypto.Cipher import DES</code> works just fine.</p>

"47290667","Simple Python AES decryption for longer ciphertexts","<p>I am not an expert in AES and moreover I have to deliver the deciphering function to a very limited Python 2 environment.</p>

<p>I have a 32-byte <strong>key</strong> and a 16-byte initialisation <strong>vector</strong> along with a 64-byte test cipher <strong>message</strong> - all of type <code>str</code>. AES operates in a cipher-block chaining mode.</p>

<p>With <code>pycrypto</code> it all works and I get a 64-symbol decrypted message of type <code>unicode</code>.</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES

cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, vector)
decryption = cipher.decrypt(message).decode()
print(decryption)
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately the <code>pycrypto</code> itself is not supported in the final environment as I believe it has some fancy compiled dependencies for AES.
There is a purely Python alternative called <code>pyaes</code>:</p>

<pre><code>import pyaes

cipher = pyaes.AESModeOfOperationCBC(key, vector)
decryption = cipher.decrypt(message[0:16]).decode()
print(decryption)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that I sliced the first 16 bytes and got the first 16 symbols of the decrypted message (of type <code>unicode</code>) correctly.</p>

<p>However, once I try the full message I get
<code>ValueError: ciphertext block must be 16 bytes</code>.</p>

<p>Even if I slice <code>message[16:32]</code>, I get 
<code>UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xb8 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)</code>.</p>

<p>So how to use the <code>pyaes</code> and decrypt longer ciphertexts in my case?</p>

<hr>

<p>The secret plaintext looks like this</p>

<pre><code>{""valueInt"":123, ""valueFloat"":1.23, ""valueString"":""123""}
</code></pre>

<p>with trailing (padded) spaces.</p>
","<p>Possibility 1. The case of the message[16:32] is that the first part of your unencrypted text could have multibyte characters, so after taking 16 bytes, 1+ byte is leaking to the second part of your original/unencrypted string. Though this is only if you are using multibyte characters.</p>

<p>If you are also encrypting them, you could try converting the text to binary first if your encoding is utf8: </p>

<pre><code>cipher.encrypt(mystring.encode('utf8'))
</code></pre>

<p>and in reverse</p>

<pre><code>cipher.decrypt(mystring.decode('utf8'))
</code></pre>

<p>Possiblity 2. If you are decrypting with the same AESModeOfOperationCFB you should try with a new instance for decryption. The following code fails to decrypt the correct text which contains non valid ascii bytes.</p>

<pre><code>cipher = pyaes.AESModeOfOperationCBC(key, vector)
encrypted = cipher.decrypt('Hello world')
print(encrypted)
# ?Eg?m??K?(|
decrypted = cipher.decrypt(encrypted)
print(decrypted)
# ?XL=?-QE??Y?=k
</code></pre>

<p>But if you do this way:</p>

<pre><code>encrypter = pyaes.AESModeOfOperationCBC(key, vector)
encrypted = cipher.encrypt('Hello world !!!!')
print(encrypted)
# ?Eg?m??K?(|
decrypter = pyaes.AESModeOfOperationCBC(key, vector)
decrypted = decrypter.decrypt(encrypted)
# Hello world !!!!
</code></pre>

<p>If you are encrypting 2 blocks with same instance and then concatenate them, you need a new instance which decrypt 2 new blocks. Or encrypt/decrypt each block with a new instance each.</p>

<p>Can someone help me in resolving this issue?</p>
","<p>I suspect you have not correctly transferred your encrypted token. But there isn't a lot to go on.</p>

<p>I've used you example code though to help me write the below which does seem to work, (thank you for that) or at least it decrypted a value from another implementation.</p>

<p>In my case it was a node JS implementation</p>

<pre><code>var nodeRsa = require(""node-rsa"");
const key = new nodeRsa( ""-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n\
                              .
                              .
                              .
                          -----END PUBLIC KEY-----"");
key.encrypt(""passwd"",""base64"");
</code></pre>

<p>If I took the output of the above and put in a file called 'ciphertext', this following python decrypts the message correctly.</p>

<pre><code>import Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEP as rsaenc
import Crypto.PublicKey.RSA as RSA

## Load the private key and the base 64 ciphertext.
with open(""key.pem"") as f:
    keystring = f.read()

with open(""ciphertext"",""rb"") as f:
    base64msg = f.read()

# Create the binary ciphertext
binmsg=codecs.decode(base64msg,'base64')

# Setup the RSA objetcs
k = RSA.importKey(keystring)
cipher = rsaenc.new(k)

plaintext = cipher.decrypt(binmsg)

<p>Our application uses Python 2.7</p>

<p>EDIT: we have some database fields that we want protected, that need to be accessed in the code but there is no reason to leave them in the database in plain text. Obviously I'd like to make it as hard as possible to retrieve the key (understanding that it is never impossible). </p>
","<p>There is no way to absolutely protect a key if you don't trust the environment that the code is running in. You could store (part of) the key in a trusted location and only accept queries for the key from the domain/IP of your app. But then it would still be in that appengine instance's memory.</p>

<p>The best solution for outgoing messages is to use public-key crypto. Let your code use the public key of the remote party, since those don't have to be kept secret. It can then only be decrypted with the remote's private key.</p>

<p>If you can't trust the appengine's environment, you can't decrypt incoming public-key messages because that would require your secret key to be available to the application.</p>

<p>Unlike CBC where decrypting with the IV recovers at least a part of the plaintext, OFB is a streaming mode. If the alignment between actual ciphertext and generated stream (based in IV and key) is not perfect, the original plaintext cannot be recovered.</p>

<p>I'm using <a href=""http://www.jcryption.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">jCryption</a> in client side. It uses handshaking in the beginning of the connection, the procedures happen as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>client generate random AES password.</li>
<li>client request RSA publicKey form server</li>
<li>server send it</li>
<li>Client use RSA public key to encrypt the password and send it to server.</li>
<li>Now, both use that password to encrypt data they send to each other.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>My problem</em> is in the step of sending the password encrypted with RSA (step 4), since jCryption sends it in hex format, but <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/sybren/python-rsa"" rel=""nofollow"">python-rsa</a> expect binary integer ,,</p>

<p>How to convert the jCryption output to a format python-rsa can deal with, or is there are another library that can do it ?</p>

<p>Lets write views for our ajaxes</p>

<p>Getting public key. If we don't have one in project directory then generate the pair.</p>

        key = f.read()
        f.close()

<p>And the most tricky part. Our own middleware. You need to add it to MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES in settings.py . Something like 'myapp.views.JCryptionMiddleware' if you place it in your myapp's views.py file.</p>

<p>The trick is that we send the wrong POST data with only 'jCryption' attr. The middleware decrypts apropriate data in this attr and rewrites the POST data in the request object with it.
Read about middlewares in Django documentation.</p>

<p>Why don't they match? Am I doing something wrong?</p>
","<p>There are two issues here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Node's automatic padding is PKCS padding. Your python code is using null bytes for padding instead, which is a different format. The <a href=""https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/crypto.html#crypto_cipher_setautopadding_autopadding"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">node documentation</a> even explicitly mentions disabling auto padding in order to use null byte padding.</p></li>
<li><p>The JSON is formatted slightly differently between node and python. Javascript's <code>JSON.stringify()</code> removes all unnecessary whitespace, whereas python leaves <em>some</em> whitespace (e.g. between elements in an array/object). The easiest solution to this will probably be to change the python code to specify an explicit <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html#json.dump"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>separators</code> option</a>: <code>json.dumps({ ""a"": 1, ""b"": 2 }, separators=(',', ':'))</code>, since the javascript's <code>JSON.stringify()</code> isn't as flexible when it comes to changing the formatting in this way.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The node code below shows that by matching the JSON output <em>and</em> using the proper padding, you will get the same hex output as python:</p>

<pre><code>const crypto = require('crypto');

const KEY = Buffer.from([0x58, 0x86, 0x17, 0x6d, 0x88, 0x7c, 0x9a, 0xa0, 0x61, 0x1b, 0xbb, 0x3e, 0x20, 0x28, 0xa4, 0x5a]);

I'm guessing I'm doing something incorrect on the Python side, but I can not figure out what that might be. <em>EDIT</em>: For clarity, the C code is returning what I'm after, I need to make Python return the same thing. In doing some more digging, I'm thinking that my issue is that I need to specify <code>RSA_PKCS1_PADDING</code> in my Python code. When I try to decrypt on the C side, I get back;</p>

","<p>You are doing completely different operations with openssl and with Python. You are performing RSA signing with openssl, but RSA encryption with PyCrypto. With openssl, as the documentation makes clear:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;openssl/rsa.h&gt;
int RSA_private_encrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from, unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa, int padding);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>RSA_private_encrypt() <strong>signs</strong> the flen bytes at from (usually a
  message digest with an algorithm identifier) using the private key rsa
  and stores the signature in to. to must point to RSA_size(rsa) bytes
  of memory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words it perform RSA PKCS #1 ver 1.5 block type 1 signing.</p>

<p>Whereas in PyCrypto, despite the fact that you are using a private key, the encrypt method treats it as a public key (a pycrypto RSA private key is a subclass of RSA public key) and performs RSA PKCS#1 version 1.5 block type 2 encryption.
Since you give no hint of what you are trying to accomplish I can't say which result is the correct one.</p>

<p>If you want PyCrypto RSA signing, the <a href=""https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/signature/pkcs1_v1_5.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation has this example</a>:</p>

The successfull decryption of the perl passphrase was mostly for verify input params. (Taking IV straight from perl and removing Crypt::CBC's added 16 char of salt before decrypting made it work, various posts on SO helped me..).</p>

<p>Then is the unsuccessful attempt to encryption passhphrase and generate the same output as perl.
I think i just need to use the right combination of the verified input params to get it working...maybe the salt should be padded? Or padding in general is wrong? Or iv input should not be hexlified? (it need to be 8 chars..)</p>

","<p>I know the thread is old but maybe it will help someone in the future. The hints below refer to Android Keystore v3 and v4 (Oreo and Pie respectively).</p>

<p>Basically the HAL keystore (as described <a href=""https://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/interfaces/+/master/keymaster/3.0/IKeymasterDevice.hal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>) is wrapped in the keystore service.
The service API mimics the interface described in IKeymasterDevice.hal. Instead of blob you can use a string alias for the key (e.g. ""mySecretKey"").
The service stores the keyblobs (raw key material + key parameters) to the file system. Default location is /data/misc/keystore/user_0/&lt;uid&gt;_&lt;key_alias&gt;.</p>

<p>Keystore service is also the layer which checks whether requesting process is allowed to use the key (based on process uid).</p>

<p>The communication with keystore service is done via binder interface (IPC). You may want to read more about it <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Binder"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>AOSP contains reference client implementation <a href=""http://androidxref.com/9.0.0_r3/xref/system/security/keystore/keystore_client_impl.cpp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Example usage can be found in the stock CLI <a href=""http://androidxref.com/9.0.0_r3/xref/system/security/keystore/keystore_cli_v2.cpp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a></p>

<p>The AOSP comes with SW based keystore implementation which can be found <a href=""http://androidxref.com/9.0.0_r3/xref/system/keymaster/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. By default the keyblob on AOSP builds are not encrypted.</p>

<p>Note that the stock keystore_cli_v2 does NOT provide support for key import. If you plan to encrypt the data offline (e.g. pycrypto) you must extend it. If you plan to do so remember that the keystore_client_impl.cpp is linked to libkeystore_binder.so and not the keystore_cli_v2.</p>

<p>For the asymmetric key ciphers you may export the public key component using the API.</p>

I need it for keys  analysis in DES and 8 byte key requirement for associated library is creating problem in getting actual keys analysis.</p>
","<p>As explained in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard</a>, the 8-byte key for DES is just a 56-bit key in 8 bytes with odd parity check added:</p>

<p>The key is nominally stored or transmitted as 8 bytes, each with odd parity. According to ANSI X3.92-1981, section 3.5:</p>

<pre><code>One bit in each 8-bit byte of the KEY may be utilized for error detection in key generation, distribution, and storage. Bits 8, 16,..., 64 are for use in ensuring that each byte is of odd parity.
</code></pre>

<p>(end quote)</p>

<p>So given an 8-byte key I can generate a 7-byte key by dropping the parity check bits and reformatting, and given a 7-byte key I can generate an 8-byte key by reformatting and adding parity check bits. It should therefore be easy to produce wrappers to make a library for one key format look like a library for another - or are you having some other problem I haven't noticed?</p>

I need it for keys  analysis in DES and 8 byte key requirement for associated library is creating problem in getting actual keys analysis.</p>
","<p>In DES a key is comprised of 8 bytes with the LSB a parity bit, a nice and regular structure.  There's an implication there for the relationship between input bytes and Permuted Choice 1, which loads the two 28 bit C and D Registers. </p>

<p>In parlance of the NBS standard a Permuted Choice is a selection permutation not using all the values of a greater whole.</p>

<p>Historically any DES implementation that used 7 bytes wasn't compatible where there are several FIPS/Nist pubs specifying key/ciphertext/plaintext triplets.</p>

<p>If you have a need for a 56 bit number representing a key there's an implication you're using or storing them in a tabular fashion.  Otherwise you could simply guarantee the parity bit is either correct or say '0'.  'Packed' keys are only of interest for saving storage space.</p>

<p>All that said and done if you need a 56 bit number representing a key you could represent 8 bytes of key in a 64 bit value and after identifying the parity bit locations with respect to endian-ness, shift the 64 bit array value obliterating the parity bits one at a time in 8 operations on a 64 bit machine, leaving 56 'effective' key bits.</p>

<p>On a 32 bit or smaller machine you'd also have to track byte position to keep track of bit shift offsets and would have to deal with bits moving between bytes to pack bits into 7 bytes.</p>

<p>For a 32 bit machine you could pack two 32 bit values into 28 bits in opposite directions then merge the proper 4 bits of the second one into the first followed by shifting the second value down 8 bits.</p>

<p>For a big-endian bit in byte numbering system 1 to 8 with bit 8 the LSB (from the standard)
Bits 1-4 go to the C register, with only four  bit 4 values from 8 successive bytes of an input key (described as an input array of bits).  The D block shares bit 4 and uses bits 5-7 to derived 28 bits:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/byExT.jpg"" alt=""Permuted Choice 1""></p>

<p>The bigger issue here may be the ability to communicate any interesting finding in terms of keys useful to those dealing with an 8 byte key representation.  It may be handy to have an inverse function available as well.</p>

<p>There's also a relationship between round keys and the C and D concatenated block, shown in Carl Meyers and Stephen Metyas book ""Cryptography, A New Dimension in Computer Security', subtitled 'A Guide for the Design and Implementation of Secure Systems', Wiley Interscience, 1982, ISBN-0-471- 04892-5.</p>

<p>I recreated the table using a derivative of the original BSD libcrypt source.  The significance of this is that C and D bits don't mix in the two 24 bit values derived from Permuted Choice 2 (which is visible in selected key (KS) in round 16 of the table).</p>

    return crypted;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see above, Python produces <code>encrypted_hex</code> which equals to <code>d534bb96d3be74401001205b0d6567aa</code>. In Node, <code>encrypted_hex</code> contains the value mentioned above + <code>b4c31f7a76936598e5a1cc05385f3a91</code>.</p>

<p>Could anyone help me understand what is going on here:
Why does Node.js produces result which is twice longer ?</p>
","<p>I figured it out.
This happens because of different  behavior of Pythons' PyCrypto package and Nodes' Crypto module. I am using AES, and since it is a block cypher, it <strong>requires</strong> data to come in chunks of specified length.</p>

<p>PyCrypto fails if it encounters data which doesn't come in 16 bit chunks. Nodes' Crypto, by default will pad data, so data will always come in chunks of good size.</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity i've tested data having length of 16 bytes in the examples above. So why were the results different?</p>

<p>Python module did not pad data by default, and because data contained correct length, we've got expected result.</p>

<p>Node Crypto module, however, does pad the data, and apparently adds the whole 16 bit chunk of padding to original message (which really sounds like a bug). That is why the first part of encrypted Nodes' message corresponds to the one created in Python, the other one is just Node Crypto trying to encrypt its own excessive padding.</p>

<p>Anyway, to get rid of the error, i've simply added</p>

<pre><code> aes.setAutoPadding(false);

<p>in my <code>encrypt()</code> function.</p>

Because the IV is commonly forgotten (also that it has to be unique and unpredictable, e.g. random), Pycryptodome creates a random one when a cipher object is initialized.</p>

<p>The IV must be unique for each encryption and is required for decryption. Common practice (source?) is to put the IV at the start of the ciphertext (the IV does not to need to be secret).</p>

<p>To make your example work:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad, unpad

# Do not use raw passwords as keys,
# use a derivation functions to generate keys from them
key = b'Sixteen byte key'  
data = 'Jeevan B Manoj'.encode(""UTF-8"")
data = pad(data, AES.block_size)
encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC)
iv = encryptor.IV
decryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV=iv)

ciphertext = encryptor.encrypt(data)
plaintext = decryptor.decrypt(ciphertext)

assert plaintext == data
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Important note:</strong> The ciphertext and IV must be <em>authenticated</em> for security (so data cannot be tampered with). For that, Pycryptodome offers AEAD modes like EAX and GCM as pointed out by <a href=""https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome/issues/154#issuecomment-380759591"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hans-Peter Jansen on GitHub</a>.

<p>As I didn't find this documented explicitly anywhere (not even in Wikipedia) I write it here:
Any combination of Nonce, IV and Counter like concatenation, xor, or likes will work for CTR mode, but the standard that most libraries implement is to concatenate these values in order. So the value that is used in block cipher algorithm is usually: Nonce + IV + Counter. And counter usually starts from 1 (not 0).</p>

","<p>Compression works by identifying patterns in the data. Since you can't identify patterns in encrypted data (that's the whole point), you can't compress it.</p>

<p>For a perfect encryption algorithm that produced a 33,742 byte output, ideally all you would be able to determine about the decrypted original data is that it can fit in 33,742 bytes, but no more than that. If you could compress it to, say, 31,400 bytes, then you would immediately know the input data was not, say, 32,000 bytes of random data since random data is patternless and thus incompressible. That would indicate a failure on the part of the encryption scheme. It's nobody's business whether the decrypted data is random or not.</p>

","<p>The compression method used by tar -z relies on repeating patterns in the input file, replacing these patterns by a count of how many times the pattern repeated (grossly simplified).</p>

<p>However, when you encrypt a file, you are basically trying to hide any repeating patterns in as much 'random'-looking noise as possible. That makes your file nearly incompressible. Combine that with the overhead of the archive and compression file format (metadata, etc.) and your file actually ends up slightly larger instead.</p>

<p>You should reverse the process; compress first, <em>then</em> encrypt, and you'll increase the chances you end up with a smaller payload significantly.</p>

<p>I did a <code>json.dumps</code> of the above and encrypted with B's public key. After I decrypt it, I do not get the same message. I noticed that it goes wrong only if I include <code>client_pub_key</code> in the dict.</p>

<p>I have been looking for answers online and this is possibly why it might be going wrong:</p>

<ul>
<li>The message is too long to encrypt with B's public key</li>
<li>The <code>client_pub_key</code> has special characters which leads to a situation where JSON encoding is messed up</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Used <code>pickle</code> instead of JSON</li>
<li>Used <code>binascii.hexlify</code> to encode <code>client_pub_key</code></li>
<li>Used <code>base64.b64encode</code> to encode <code>client_pub_key</code></li>
<li>Used <code>Crypto.Util.RFC1751.key_to_english</code> to convert to some characters <code>client_pub_key</code></li>
<li>Set B's key 2048 bytes and A's key 1024 bytes</li>
</ul>

<p>All my above efforts failed. Hence I'm here looking for help.</p>

<p><strong>My Question: How do I encrypt a message of the above dict format so I can send it over to the server?</strong> 
(I'm using thrift's <code>TTornadoStreamTransport</code> and <code>TBinaryProtocol</code>, if that helps)</p>

<p>My test code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

import base64
import binascii
import json
import pickle
import socket

from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Util.RFC1751 import key_to_english

client_key = RSA.generate(1024)

message_dict = {
  'hostname': socket.getfqdn(),
  'request': 'MY_REQUEST',
  'client_pub_key': int(binascii.hexlify(client_key.publickey().exportKey()),16),
}

another_key = RSA.generate(2048)

print '\n\nDICT: {0}'.format(message_dict)
message = json.dumps(message_dict)

print '\n\nMESSAGE: {0}'.format(message)
encrypted = another_key.publickey().encrypt(message, 32)[0]

print '\n\nENCRYPTED: {0}'.format(encrypted)

decrypted = another_key.decrypt(encrypted)
print '\n\nMESSAGE: {0}'.format(decrypted)

result = json.loads(decrypted)
print '\n\nDICT: {0}'.format(result)
# result should be same message_dict

","<p>Your problem will be, that the message which you try to encrypt should be never larger than the n-modulo!</p>

<p>Because:</p>

<p>cipher = message ** e (mod N)</p>

<p>If your message is numerically larger than the RSA module (in your case 2048 BITS - not Bytes), you won't get the correct ciphertext, and decription will never work. (mathematically)</p>

<p>In your case this happens.</p>

<p>You should be careful, because I guess, that after the json.dumps() the message should not larger than (in your case of the 2048bit another_key) 2048//8 = 256 bytes long - you can test it after json.dumps() via len(message).
In your abovementioned example the length of your message will be larger than 700 bytes... and 700 > 256.</p>

<p>Just to show the meaning of this:
first try a message with exactly 256bytes of length:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import json
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
&gt;&gt;&gt; another_key = RSA.generate(2048)
&gt;&gt;&gt; message_dict = {'t':'a'*248}
&gt;&gt;&gt; message = json.dumps(message_dict)
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(str(message))
256
&gt;&gt;&gt; enc = another_key.publickey().encrypt(message, 32)[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; dec = another_key.decrypt(enc)
</code></pre>

<p>You will see, in this example the length of the message is exactly 256 bytes (not bits, but 256*8 = 2048 bits) long - and it works fine!</p>

<p>But now let us try a length of 257 bytes (more than the length of the n modulo (2048 bits = 256 bytes):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import json
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
&gt;&gt;&gt; another_key = RSA.generate(2048)
&gt;&gt;&gt; message_dict = {'t':'a'*249}
&gt;&gt;&gt; message = json.dumps(message_dict)
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(str(message))
257
&gt;&gt;&gt; enc = another_key.publickey().encrypt(message, 32)[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; dec = another_key.decrypt(enc)
</code></pre>

<p>In this case dec != enc - because the message is numerically larger than the n modulo.</p>

<p>If you will mathematically understand the reason for this, take a look in the meaning of ""cipher = message ** e (mod N)"" ;)</p>

<p>how can i make this edits ? thanks all</p>
","<p>You can't generally read from and write to a file at the same time.</p>

<p>So, you have two basic options.</p>

<hr>

<p>First, you can read into memory, then encrypt, then write back out. Hopefully you have an <code>encrypt</code> function that works on strings rather than files. Since you've tagged this <code>pycrypto</code>, and all of its engines work on strings, this should be trivial. But if you have to use files, you can usually use <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BytesIO"" rel=""nofollow""><code>BytesIO</code></a> (or, for 2.x, <code>cStringIO.StringIO</code>), which wraps up a byte string in a file-like object, like this:</p>

<pre><code>def encrypt_file(path, password):
    temp = io.BytesIO()
    with open(path, 'rb') as in_file:
        encrypt(in_file, temp, password)
    with open(path, 'wb') as out_file:
        out_file.write(temp.getvalue())
</code></pre>

<p>This is dead simple, but of course it could be a problem if your files are gigantic.</p>

<hr>

<p>Or you can write to a <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile"" rel=""nofollow""><code>NamedTemporaryFile</code></a>, then <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.replace"" rel=""nofollow""><code>replace</code></a> the original file with the temporary:</p>

<pre><code>def encrypt_file(path, password):
    dir = os.path.dirname(path)
    with open(path, 'rb') as in_file, tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(dir=dir, delete=False) as out_file:
        encrypt(in_file, temp, password)
    os.replace(temp.name, path)
</code></pre>

<p>This has some major advantages over the other method—it doesn't necessarily take a ton of memory (that depends on how <code>encrypt</code> is written), and there's no chance of leaving behind a partially-written file if you pull the plug (<code>os.replace</code> is atomic—it either happens completely, or not at all). But it's a little more complicated. And, before Python 3.3, there was no <code>replace</code> function. On Unix, <code>rename</code> works just as well. On Windows… well, that's a whole mess.</p>

</code></pre>
","<p>Ok, let's fix a few things that are wrong with your code. First the most obvious one - your padding would break on Python 3.5+ (and your user 'menu' would break on 2.x) because <code>infile.read()</code> would give you <code>bytes</code> array so trying to add a string formed by <code>chunk += ' ' * (16 - (len(chunk) % 16))</code> would result in an error. You would need to convert your whitespace pad to <code>bytes</code> array first:  <code>chunk += b' ' * (16 - (len(chunk) % 16))</code></p>

<p>But whitespace padding like this is a bad idea - when you're later decrypting your file how will you know how much, if any, padding you've added? You need to store this somewhere - and you do in the 'header' via the <code>filesize</code> value, telling a potential attacker how exactly big is your file and how much padding was added opening you to a padding oracle attack (which is possible with the bellow code so do not use it for passing messages without adding a proper MAC to it).</p>

<p>There are plenty of robust padding schemes that you can use - I personally prefer <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652#section-6.3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PKCS#7</a> which is simply padding your uneven block or adding a whole new block with <code>n</code> number of bytes with the value of <code>n</code> - that way, after decryption, you can pick the last byte from your block and know exactly how many bytes were padded so you can strip them. So, replace your encryption portion with:</p>

<pre><code>def encrypt(key, filename):
    outputfile = filename + ""(encrypted)""
    chunksize = 1024 * AES.block_size  # use the cipher's defined block size as a multiplier
    IV = bytes([random.randint(0, 0xFF) for _ in range(AES.block_size)])  # bytes immediately
    encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)
    with open(filename, 'rb') as infile:
        with open(outputfile, 'wb') as outfile:
            outfile.write(IV)  # write the IV
            padded = False
            while not padded:  # loop until the last block is padded
                chunk = infile.read(chunksize)
                chunk_len = len(chunk)
                # if no more data or the data is shorter than the required block size
                if chunk_len == 0 or chunk_len % AES.block_size != 0:
                    padding = AES.block_size - (chunk_len % AES.block_size)
                    chunk += bytes([padding]) * padding
                    # on Python 2.x replace with: chunk += chr(padding_len) * padding_len
                    padded = True
                outfile.write(encryptor.encrypt(chunk))
</code></pre>

<p>I've also changed your <code>chunksize</code> to match the block size you're using (multiples of <code>AES.block_size</code>) - it just happens that 64 is a multiple of 16 but you should pay attention to those things.</p>

<p>Now that we have the encryption sorted out, the decryption is all this but in reversal - decrypt all blocks, read the last byte of the last block and remove <code>n</code> amount of bytes from behind matching the value of the last byte:</p>

<pre><code>def decrypt(key, filename):
    outputfile = filename[:-11] + ""(decrypted)""
    chunksize = 1024 * AES.block_size  # use the cipher's defined block size as a multiplier
    with open(filename, 'rb') as infile:
        IV = infile.read(AES.block_size)
        decryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)
        with open(outputfile, 'wb') as outfile:
            old_chunk = b''  # stores last chunk, needed for reading data with a delay
            stripped = False
            while not stripped:  # delayed loop until the last block is stripped
                chunk = decryptor.decrypt(infile.read(chunksize))  # decrypt as we read
                if len(chunk) == 0:  # no more data
                    padding = old_chunk[-1]  # pick the padding value from the last byte
                    if old_chunk[-padding:] != bytes([padding]) * padding:
                        raise ValueError(""Invalid padding..."")
                    old_chunk = old_chunk[:-padding]  # strip the padding
                    stripped = True
                outfile.write(old_chunk)  # write down the 'last' chunk
                old_chunk = chunk  # set the new chunk for checking in the next loop

","<p>MySQL is trying to store your byte string in a character column. Because the connection character set is UTF-8 but the byte string doesn't represent a valid UTF-8 sequence, it gets mangled.</p>

<p>To get raw bytes into the database properly you need to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>make the column a BINARY type (or generally character type with a binary collation), and</p></li>
<li><p>use parameterised queries to get the data into the database instead of interpolating them into the query string where they might mix with non-binary (Unicode) content.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You should use parameterised queries anyway because the string interpolation you're using now, with no escaping, is vulnerable to SQL injection. In web.py that might look like:</p>

<pre><code>query_string= 'INSERT INTO %s (%s) VALUES ($value)' % (table, column)
db.query(query_string, vars= {'value': value})
</code></pre>

<p>(assuming that the <code>table</code> and <code>column</code> values are known-good.)</p>

<p>Doing it like this also means you don't have to worry about the dollar sign.</p>

<p>The other approach is to use a normal character string, encoding away the non-ASCII bytes. You're doing this with uucode in your current workaround, but base64 would be a more common alternative that's easier to get to in Python (<code>ciphertext.encode('base64')</code>). Hex encoding (<code>.encode('hex')</code>) is most common for the case of a hash.</p>

The client server wants to log a message with the logging server by passing over a username, password, and message over the internet.  With my current implementation I'm hitting an error when trying to decrypt the encrypted message, username, and password that was sent over the wire.  It looks like I should be trying to decrypt a ""byte string"" according to the pycrypto documentation, but I can't seem to create a byte string correctly since I haven't been able to get around this problem.  Also, it feels like my implementation is taking me down a rabbit hole of security vulnerabilities and codec confusion.  Is there a package that I should look at which already implements this type of functionality?  If so what would that implementation look like?</p>

","<p>You are very close to decrypting the values on the server. The result of the encryption on the client is a tuple. When you urllib2.unquote the items on the server, you then recreate tuples from them.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; c = public.encrypt('Hello', ""ignored"")
&gt;&gt;&gt; c
('3\xae0\x1f\xd7\xe4b\xd4\xf1\xf4\x88!Be\xff!\x1e\xda\x82\x10\x9bRy\x0c\xa0v\xed\x84\xf9\xe35\xc6QG\xcf\xb7\x1b\xea\x9fe\t\x9b\x8d\xd6\xf3\x8cw\xde\x17\xb5\xf7\x9a+\x84i%@\x8a\xdf\xf4\xdd\xc8wY',)
</code></pre>

<p>which in your code you pack into params like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; params = { ""message"" : c }
&gt;&gt;&gt; params
{'message': ('3\xae0\x1f\xd7\xe4b\xd4\xf1\xf4\x88!Be\xff!\x1e\xda\x82\x10\x9bRy\x0c\xa0v\xed\x84\xf9\xe35\xc6QG\xcf\xb7\x1b\xea\x9fe\t\x9b\x8d\xd6\xf3\x8cw\xde\x17\xb5\xf7\x9a+\x84i%@\x8a\xdf\xf4\xdd\xc8wY',)}
&gt;&gt;&gt; urllib.urlencode(params)
'message=%28%273%5Cxae0%5Cx1f%5Cxd7%5Cxe4b%5Cxd4%5Cxf1%5Cxf4%5Cx88%21Be%5Cxff%21%5Cx1e%5Cxda%5Cx82%5Cx10%5Cx9bRy%5Cx0c%5Cxa0v%5Cxed%5Cx84%5Cxf9%5Cxe35%5Cxc6QG%5Cxcf%5Cxb7%5Cx1b%5Cxea%5Cx9fe%5Ct%5Cx9b%5Cx8d%5Cxd6%5Cxf3%5Cx8cw%5Cxde%5Cx17%5Cxb5%5Cxf7%5Cx9a%2B%5Cx84i%25%40%5Cx8a%5Cxdf%5Cxf4%5Cxdd%5Cxc8wY%27%2C%29'
</code></pre>

<p>I would guess that urllib2.unquote(p[""message""]) returns this (but I did not try this):</p>

<pre><code>""('3\\xae0\\x1f\\xd7\\xe4b\\xd4\\xf1\\xf4\\x88!Be\\xff!\\x1e\\xda\\x82\\x10\\x9bRy\\x0c\\xa0v\\xed\\x84\\xf9\\xe35\\xc6QG\\xcf\\xb7\\x1b\\xea\\x9fe\\t\\x9b\\x8d\\xd6\\xf3\\x8cw\\xde\\x17\\xb5\\xf7\\x9a+\\x84i%@\\x8a\\xdf\\xf4\\xdd\\xc8wY',)""
</code></pre>

<p>then you can recreate the tuple at the server like this (m is the unquoted message):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from ast import literal_eval
&gt;&gt;&gt; literal_eval(m)
('3\xae0\x1f\xd7\xe4b\xd4\xf1\xf4\x88!Be\xff!\x1e\xda\x82\x10\x9bRy\x0c\xa0v\xed\x84\xf9\xe35\xc6QG\xcf\xb7\x1b\xea\x9fe\t\x9b\x8d\xd6\xf3\x8cw\xde\x17\xb5\xf7\x9a+\x84i%@\x8a\xdf\xf4\xdd\xc8wY',)
</code></pre>

<p>once you have the tuple back, you can decrypt it:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; private.decrypt(literal_eval(m))
'Hello'
</code></pre>

<p>It would be better to find a vetted and standard mechanism to do this rather than roll your own. For example, in your scheme, I could capture different messages between the client and server, and then mix and match messages and username/password pairs, making it appear that the messages came from different users.</p>

<p>However, with just this minor tweak (recreating the tuples from the ""unquoted"" strings) your code should decrypt just fine.</p>

I would thank you very much for your help.</p>
","<h3>Short answer (TL;DR):</h3>

<p>The <code>decrypt()</code> method is returning your <code>random_generator</code> function.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If you type</p>

<pre><code>help(PKCS1_v1_5.PKCS115_Cipher.decrypt)
</code></pre>

<p>you can read this from the official documentation:  </p>

<pre><code>decrypt(self, ct, sentinel) method of 
Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_v1_5.PKCS115_Cipher instance
Decrypt a PKCS#1 v1.5 ciphertext.

[...]    

:Parameters:
[...]
 sentinel : any type
        The object to return to indicate that an error was detected  
        during decryption.
</code></pre>

<p>As you can read from above, if there is an error during decryption then the <code>sentinel</code> object is returned instead of a byte string, then in your code the <code>decrypt()</code> method would return the <code>random_generator</code> function.   </p>

<p>This is why your <code>text</code> variable is a function and you cannot treat it as a byte string.</p>

<h3>Further note</h3>

<p>I think there is no need to pass a random generator to <code>decrypt()</code> as a sentinel object, because it is just a sentinel object used to detect errors. Please see the <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PyCrypto documentation</a> to learn more about this library (but also read <a href=""https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/issues/238"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> and <a href=""https://www.pycryptodome.org/en/latest/src/vs_pycrypto.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> and consider using <a href=""https://www.pycryptodome.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PyCryptodome</a> instead).</p>

<p>In your PowerShell code, you need to use <code>PKCS7</code> instead of <code>Zeros</code> for the padding.</p>

<p>In the PowerShell code you don't implement the key padding with zeros anywhere. This is required (I'm not sure how you get this to work at all without it).</p>

","<p>Strings (<code>str</code>) are text. Encryption does not deal in text, it deals in bytes (<code>bytes</code>).</p>

<p>In practice insert <code>.encode</code> and <code>.decode</code> calls where necessary to convert between the two. I recommend UTF-8 encoding.</p>

<p>In your case since you are already encoding and decoding the ciphertext as base-64 which is another bytes/text conversion, you only need to encode and decode your plaintext. Encode your string with <code>.encode(""utf-8"")</code> when passing it into the encryption function, and decode the final result with <code>.decode(""utf-8"")</code> when getting it out of the decryption function.</p>

<p>If you're reading examples or tutorials make sure they are for Python 3. In Python 2 <code>str</code> was a byte string and it was commonplace to use it for both text and bytes, which was very confusing. In Python 3 they fixed it.</p>

"49981694","Using mysql AES encrypt and decrypt from Django","<p>In my Django app, I want to use <code>AES_ENCRYPT</code> and <code>AES_DECRYPT</code> from the mysql database to encrypt and decrypt stuff.<br>
I know that python's Crypto package has AES support but the Crypto AES doesn't produce the same result as mysql AES although I made sure that both are using the ECB mode.<br>
So, now I'm doing this:  </p>

<pre><code>sql = ""select 1 as id, AES_ENCRYPT(my_field, '16-bytes encryption key') as field_enc from appname_table""
encrypted_fields = MyModel.objects.raw(sql)
</code></pre>

<p>This gets me the field values after encryption and it works fine. The issue is that the AES algorithm encryption final result has many unprintable characters, it looks like this:  </p>

<pre><code>encrypted_fields[3].field_enc
'\x88\xc5\xe4\xa0c?\xf8\x16|^1JB\x83{\xdf'
print(encrypted_fields[3].field_enc)
���c?�|^1JB�{�
</code></pre>

<p>So, now when I try to take this same value to decrypt it, the mysql replies with an error that says </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""OperationalError: (1300, ""Invalid utf8 character string:
  '\x88\xC5\xE4\xA0c'"")""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess this is because I tried to send unprintable characters to the mysql query.  </p>

<p>So, how do I approach this?<br>
Please note that I have to use the MySQL functions because I encrypted some database fields using these functions so I need to decrypt them with the same function because Crypto's AES doesn't get the same results. Crypto keeps asking that the text to be encrypted has to be 16 bytes long like the key, while mysql doesn't require that.  </p>

<p>I also tried to see if mysql use some kind of padding for the text before encryption but it doesn't say what characters they pad on their <a href=""https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/encryption-functions.html#function_aes-encrypt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">webpage</a>:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The str and crypt_str arguments can be any length, and padding is
  automatically added to str so it is a multiple of a block as required
  by block-based algorithms such as AES. This padding is automatically
  removed by the AES_DECRYPT() function</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>After many googles, I found this <a href=""https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/05/replicating-mysql-aes-encryption-methods-with-php/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blog article</a> about replicating mysql AES Encryption in PHP.<br>
They key turned out to be that the character used for padding is the character that has an ascii code equal to the difference in length between the AES block size and the length of the text.  </p>

<pre><code>c = chr(16 - len(text_to_be_encrypted))
def align_str(s, n, char):
    if len(s) &lt; n:
        diff = n - len(s)
        for i in range(diff):
            s += char
    return s
s = align_str(text_to_be_encrypted, 16, c)
e = encryption_suite.encrypt(s)

<p>and it worked. It produced the same output as mysql encryption. </p>

On the hardware RSASSA_PSS with SHA256 data hash and MGF1 SHA1 identifier is used.</p>

<p>I get a valid signature response from the signature generated by pycrypto while the signature seems to be invalid in case of cryptography module.</p>

<p>The below implementation is for pycrpto:</p>

# Load private key and sign message
signer = PKCS1_PSS.new(private_key)
sig = signer.sign(digest)
print(binascii.hexlify(sig))

<p>and the below implementation is for cryptogrpahy module:</p>

<pre><code>from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import utils
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes

<p>I understand that the signatures obtained are not the same due to the randomness involved in the generation for PSS algorithm. The algorithm setting in both the cases is the same.</p>

<p>The HASH value from SHA256 for the data match in both the modules, but the signature generated when checked on the hardware returns invalid in case of cryptography module.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Is something wrong with the parameter usage in case of cryptography module?</p>

<p>From the documentation of the pycrypto module, I see that SHA1 is used for mgf1 and the salt length also equals the maximum length of the hash algorithm.</p>

<p>So using the same values in cryptography module should provide me a valid signature.</p>

<p>Also verifying the signature generated by cryptography APIs return sign invalid when checked using the corresponding public key with the pycrypto APIs.</p>

<p>I have tried to generate signature with mgf1 with hash Alg of sha256 as well just to check with the latest predominant embedded hardware implementations but with no progress here as well.</p>

<p>For anyone facing a similar issue, the default hash alg in MGF1 function in pycrypto or OPENSSL for RSASSA-PSS is SHA256 and a salt_length equal to the digest length of the data.</p>

<p>I am trying to build an application in Django 1.6.5 and MySQL where some database fields are encrypted in order to respect the privacy of users.

<p>However, I am running into a problem when using <code>EncryptedCharField</code> for floats.  Now, simple typecasting has been useful--this problem doesn't seem to be that problem.

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; account.current_value = float(account.current_value) - 10

<p>Not normal. With PKCS#1 v1.5 the signature should always be the same with the same private key.</p>

<p>Check the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The SHA256 hash is exactly the same on both ends</li>
<li>I'm not a Python expert, but it also seems weird that you are calling RSA.generate() when you already have key</li>
</ul>

<p>Given that your Python code is giving different signature every time, I would concentrate my investigation on that part. If a single byte is different in the input data the produced hash is different - so check with your Python code if the hash is changing with the same input data.</p>

","<p>Someone posted an answer, suggesting me to check python code and told that its NOT normal to get different signature for fixed private key. I don't know for what reason he deleted the answer, but his observation was right. Actually the way I was getting the key pairs in python is totally wrong. I am generating new key pair every time and exporting it to local variable pub_key &amp; priv_key. Instead I should do something like this;</p>

<pre><code>#key = RSA.generate(2048)
#pub_key = RSA.publickey().exportKey(public_key) 
priv_key = RSA.importKey(private_key)
pub_key = RSA.importKey(public_key)

<p>The process of getting GameCenter authentication working with Google App Engine is proving to  be very troublesome.</p>
","<p>As it turns out, the reason is because the file downloaded from Apple is actually an X.509 certificate.  The public key has to be extracted from this certificate before it can be used.  This answer is demonstrated in a similar post:</p>

","<p>Perhaps sign a hash of the transaction. At verification time you can take the hash again verify that.</p>

<p>Regarding the signing of messages, the documentation says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The piece of data to sign with RSA. It may not be numerically larger
  than the RSA module (n).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Watch out though. The documentation for <code>sign</code> and <code>verify</code> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Attention: this function performs the plain, primitive RSA encryption
  (textbook). In real applications, you always need to use proper
  cryptographic padding, and you should not directly verify data with
  this method. Failure to do so may lead to security vulnerabilities. It
  is recommended to use modules Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_PSS or
  Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_v1_5 instead.</p>

We are using Jwt for API authentication. We have one endpoint url which takes username and password (POST request) and authenticate the user using django backends. We have deployed both the application on APACHE HTTP Server and using SSL (Https) for encryption. </p>

<p>But we also want to encrypt the request payload (data sent to the django API). In current case encrypt the username and password from angular app and decrypt the corresponding data in django. For this, we are using CryptoJs in angular app and Pycrypto in Django. But we are unable to decrypt the data in django.</p>

<p>Here is the decrypt function code we are using on django app:</p>

<pre><code>MODE = AES.MODE_CBC

key = 'k%eu6sy)h&amp;vue#5yrpok#1)^1ya#l1t('

def decrypt(ciphertext,key, mode):
    encobj = AES.new('k%eu6sy)h&amp;vue#5yrpok#1)^1ya#l1t(', AES.MODE_CBC)

<p>We are using CBC mode in CryptoJs as well. </p>

<p>Above code is just a sample code. Can somebody suggest, is this the right approach to go, or we should change the approach and do something else.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance !</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Can somebody suggest, is this the right approach to go</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do you want to encrypting the payload separately (outside ssl)? </p>

<p>When it comes to credentials (username, password), if you encrypt in the browser, you need to have a key inside the script somewhere. That doesn't add anything to security, only increases the solution complexity. </p>

<p>You may use an asymmetric cipher (RSA, ECC) to encrypt data using server's public key. Oh, wait - HTTPS does that already for you.</p>

<p>Client side encryption may have its place where you don't want the server to access the data (e.g. secured messaging, password manager, ..), however for username and password the server needs to read and process the credentials anyway. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But we are unable to decrypt the data in django.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we have no idea how do you encrypt data on the client side. You may try to edit your question and add the encryption code and error message</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>or we should change the approach and do something else</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though there are definitely some issues in your code (I am unable to tell if it's all of them)</p>

<ul>
<li>ciphertext (encrypted data) are usually binary (having non-printable characters). That's why when passing as parameters, the data are usually encoded to printable common characters (hex, base64, ..). I see you directly decrypt the parameters, are you sure the data are not encoded / posted  correctly?</li>
<li>I see you are not using any IV (initialization vector for CBC mode). I assume you library used will just use zero array IV. Using static / zero IV is VERY unsafe for CBC mode (or any mode generally). Are you sure the client doesn't include some sort of IV? </li>
<li>CBC mode is malleable, you should apply some integrity check (with the integrity secret in the client script it doesn't add any value either)</li>
</ul>

<p>This all is already done (and done well) using HTTPS, so so you are just trying to implement another layer of encryption with not really added value (and as well with apparent weaknesses). I believe common advice here is to lean on HTTPS with confidence</p>

"42568468","RSA : decrypt openSSL certificate","<p>I am trying to decrypt an encrypted openSSL certificate using the Crypto library.
For that, I use the following function :</p>

<pre><code>def decryptMessage(privateKeyString, encryptedMessage):

    print 'Enter private key pass phrase'
    passPhrase = raw_input()

    privateKey= RSA.importKey(privateKeyString, passPhrase)

    return privateKey.decrypt(ast.literal_eval(str(encryptedMessage)))
</code></pre>

<p>This function works fine with small strings such as <code>foo</code> or <code>lorem ipsum</code>.
However, when I try to decrypt a larger string such as an OpenSSL certificate, the decryption fails and returns this</p>

<p><code> #«$,^5ô¦┬{<em>¯9██─╚áW¸ÍÀóÂ╗ö▓├ô{Òv&amp;s´À;d▒§= I×òòòÿÞ:Mu▄ñ├Zc╬a╣fÙ╚g╝z¯¹þÞÖ*└²}?õÑ:~Ì ôı*▓açõ─░3Ñz{³é├     p}7Ä¬/tıN®╣¥‗Pzô£</em>▄¤▄╩Ý,æQ'mfî.«¯┴C%tÏ­ýõ/ñlÚ0╗ò¼(Ï5▓ø5Ì└ûƒuƒä£█ÂF=)─y@O~§LßÆ▄Ð░mËÅ9Uwõh▀Û/▓Ï,APð HÑªm■Îç¼""§Ô,XvÓÏÄÃM■▓v╠@örÂùuE­</code></p>

<p>Thus, I'd like to know how my function fails to decrypt bigger strings.</p>
","<p>RSA is for en/decrypting small chunks of data, e. g. a random number which is then used for en/decrypting the communication using a block cipher like AES.  Large chunks of data are simply not supported by asymmetric encryption algorithms like RSA.</p>

<p>Your approach seems to lack the knowledge needed for doing encryption right.  This is very dangerous.  I propose to have a look at the ""cryptography"" Python package which contains everything you will need: <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cryptography"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cryptography</a></p>

<p>There are also some very nice Youtube videos of presentations before an audience the developers of this package made in which they explain how to use what and how they develop <code>cryptography</code>.</p>

My implementation in python using pycrypto is as follows.</p>

<pre><code>import base64
from Crypto.Cipher import DES3

key1 = b'key1____'
key2 = b'key2____'
key3 = b'key3____'
key = key1 + key2 + key3

print('key = {}'.format(key.hex()))
print('iv = {}'.format(initialization_vector.hex()))
print('encrypted = {}'.format(b64.decode()))

<p>Why does the outputs vary even though the algorithm and the mode are same? Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
","<p>I have solved the problem by myself. The difference was the default segment size for CFB. pycrypto's default is 8 bits, but openssl's default is 64bits. I've got a same result by specifying segment size in <code>openssl</code> command as follows.</p>

<p>Thanks </p>
","<p>You probably need gmp-devel installed, too. This gives pycrypto the headers it needs to build using libgmp.</p>

<p>On Ubuntu, I only had <code>libgmp10 installed</code>. I hit the same warning when trying to install <code>pycrypto</code>. After installing the Ubuntu package <code>libgmp-dev</code>, the warning went away and the build script indicated it was using the _fastmath extension.</p>

<p>If you already installed pycrypto without _fastmath, you can reinstall it with the -I flag, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>sudo pip install -I pycrypto

"43799066","xoring bytes and str (AES CBC)","<p>Hi I would really appreciate the help on this one since i'm really lost and I don't get why it's not working.</p>

<p>I have a 16 byte key and 16 byte block
but the key type is 'str' and the block type is 'bytes' and I want to xor between them but the value is incorrect(I think)
this code is based on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5734691/fastest-bitwise-xor-between-two-multibyte-binary-data-variables"">this</a> post</p>

<pre><code>def xor(data, key):
  if type(key) != str:
    key = str(key)

  l = len(key)
  buff=""""
  for i in range(0,len(data)):
    buff+=chr(data[i]^ord(key[i]))
  return str.encode(buff)
</code></pre>

<p>and in context:(<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_Block_Chaining_.28CBC.29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ref to CBC</a>)</p>

<pre><code>def CBC_decrypt(blocklist,IV,decrypter):
'''

:param blocklist: a 16 byte item list(or other iteratable)
:param IV: 16 byte sized iv
:param decrypter: decrypter: a generic decrypter-must provide an decrypt(plaintext) method

:return:  a list of decrypted blocks of 16 bytes
'''
 decrypted_msg=[]

 prev = IV
 for x in blocklist:
     r = xor(decrypter.decrypt(x),prev)
     decrypted_msg.append(r)
     prev = x
 return decrypted_msg


a = FileTo16ByteBlocks(path) #just read 16 bytes at a time and return a list
cipher2= AES.new(loadKey(),AES.MODE_ECB) #init AES in ECB cause we had to implement CBC
d = CBC_decrypt(a,iv[0],cipher2)
</code></pre>

<p>and here i'm writing it all to the file </p>

<pre><code># create new file iterate through the deciphered data and write it to that file
with open(str(fileSeq)+'.mp4','wb') as f:
    for i in d:
        f.write(i)
    f.write(b'')
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried other things regarding the xor (since the ECB decryption is made by the library-pycrypto) like using it's number.bytes to long and xoring that
and I've tried to cast it to ints and see how it goes, all goes really bad
and the xor thing is just a hunch I can't really lay my finger on why this is not working properly!
thanks for all the helpers</p>
","<p>I've managed to solve it!
the problem was indeed with the xor function as i thought, apparently the length of the result of the xor wasn't 16 but because of conversions it was variant(why is that though?)</p>

<p>I'm adding the code here incase anyone will need it in the future</p>

<pre><code>def xor(data, key1):
  b=key1
  if type(key1) is str:
    b = bytes(key1,encoding='utf8')

  iData = int.from_bytes(data, sys.byteorder)
  iKey = int.from_bytes(b, sys.byteorder)
  xored = iData ^ iKey
  xored = xored.to_bytes(len(data), sys.byteorder)
  return xored

<p>So here are my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If i run it I get this Error: <em>ValueError: Error 65537 while instantiating the CBC mode</em>. It occurs when it runs line 8 (cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv) and i don't know why. I saw the other Question about that error, but there he tried to decrypt an input, that wasn't declarated, which doesn't seem to be the case here.<br>
<strong>Solved:</strong> Like 'SquareRootOfTwentyThree' said, the length of my IV wasn't correct... Base64 encodes 8b to 6b. I will post the updated code with the (new) Questions under this.</p>

<p>Here is the complete sample code for <em>BlowFIsh Encryption</em> and <em>Decryption</em>, not sure what padding I need to add extra, I'm aware of the fact that BlowFISH  has a fixed data block size of 8 bytes and its keys can vary in length from <em>32 to 448 bits</em> (4 to 56 bytes).</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import Blowfish
from Crypto import Random
from struct import pack
bs = Blowfish.block_size

encryptedpass = ""myverystrongpassword""
plaintextMessage = ""Hello 8gwifi.org""

iv = os.urandom(Blowfish.block_size)
bs = Blowfish.block_size


# ENcryption
cipher = Blowfish.new(encryptedpass, Blowfish.MODE_CBC, iv)
plen = bs - divmod(len(plaintextMessage),bs)[1]
padding = [plen]*plen
padding = pack('b'*plen, *padding)

#Decryption
cipher = Blowfish.new(encryptedpass, Blowfish.MODE_CBC, iv)
msg = cipher.decrypt(ct[bs:])

print msg
</code></pre>
","<p>You failed to remove the padding after decrypt. Your padding is 8 bytes of the ASCII character ""\x08"", also known as the backspace character. When you printed it your terminal dutifully ""backspaced"" over and erased the previous 8 characters which were ""wifi.org"".</p>

<p>Now aside from the first 16 bytes of the decrypted text, you have everything decrypted correctly with a totally random choice of IV.  Can someone help me figure out where I am going wrong?</p>
","<p>That's normal for cipher block chaining. In CBC decryption, the IV is only necessary to reconstruct the first block of plaintext.

Let's say that I encrypt a file with the code I have written below, and send it over the internet. What I'm concerned about is the security of the file between computers A and B. Let's assume that the computers themselves are secure and the key is transported securely. Have I implemented things correctly? Anything else I should know about? Using Python 2.7 and PyCrypto 2.6</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for any answer.</p>

","<p>You are missing one of the most important considerations in implementing crypto, which is message integrity. Unfortunately just encrypting a message isn't enough to ensure it isn't tampered with, especially in the case of streaming modes like CTR, CFB, and OFB. </p>

<p>It looks like you are using CFB mode (MODE_CFB). The way this works is a random keystream is generated with AES, and the result is XOR-ed against the plaintext. This means that if someone flips a bit in the ciphertext, the corresponding bit will flip in the decrypted plaintext. An attacker could alter your message to mean something entirely different, and there'd be no way for you to detect it. For reference of how CFB mode (decryption) works:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/W7rYo.png"" alt=""CFB Mode""></p>

<p>If I flip the first bit of the first block of the ciphertext, it'll flip the first bit of the first block of the decrypted plaintext. </p>

<p>You need to either apply an <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HMAC</a> or use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AES-GCM</a> mode, which will handle confidentiality and integrity together. </p>

<p>There are better mode choices than CFB, so if there's no strong reason for preferring it, I would recommend AES-GCM first, then AES-CTR with HMAC second. </p>

"35228597","pyqtdeploy: add external modules","<p>is there someone who has experience with <code>pyqtdeploy</code> and adding external modules? I am currently using <code>pyqtdeploy</code> (version 1.2) together with <code>PyQt 5.5.1</code> to write an application that can be deployed to an Android device. Without any external modules, the freezing with <code>pyqtdeploy</code> works pretty well. However, I am not really sure how I can add external modules (not pure Python ones) to my application. </p>

<p>In particular, I want to add the external module <code>pycrypto</code>. Therefore, I downloaded the <code>pycrypto</code> sourcecode, compiled it with the Android toolchain (from the Android NDK) and now I have a bunch of *.py and *.so files. How can I add them to my application? </p>

<p>My initial attempt was to add the *.py and the *.so files (so basically the whole pycrypto module) to the ""Other Packages"" tab in pyqtdeploy. 
But now, when I import something pycrypto related in my application (<code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES</code>) i get the following error message: </p>

<p><code>File: "":/Crypto/Cipher/_AES.py"", line 20 in __bootstrap__
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable</code> </p>

<p>The _AES.py file where the error is thrown, looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>def __bootstrap__():
   global __bootstrap__, __loader__, __file__
   import sys, pkgutil, imp
   __file__ = pkgutil.get_data(__name__,'_AES.cpython-34m.so')
   __loader__ = None; del __bootstrap__, __loader__
   imp.load_dynamic(__name__,__file__)
__bootstrap__()
</code></pre>

<p>At first I thought, that the *.so filename was just wrong and therefore, I got the NoneType Error, so I changed the filename in _AES.py to something other like 'test.so'. Surprisingly, now, I get a different error message than before:</p>

<p><code>File "":/pkgutil.py"" line 629, in get_data
ImportError: qrcimporter: error opening file :/Crypto/Cipher/test.so</code></p>

<p>Ok, so the filename should be fine, right? But why do i get the 'NoneType` error message? What am I doing wrong? Is this the right way to accomplish this? </p>

<p>Any help is highly appreciated. I am pretty sure, that i'm only one small step away from getting this thing to work, but I can't figure out what i'm doing wrong. </p>

RSA  requires you to use the public key (now private - not distributed) to encrypt it however you cannot decrypt something encrypted with the private key with the public key. Instead you distribute the ‘private key’ for decryption and keep the ‘public key’ for encryption so no one else can encrypt or sign the data.</p>

<h1>WHAT are you doing!</h1>

<p>There is a relationship between public and private keys! You cannot just use random byte arrays.</p>

"20418696","Increasing the diffusion of the AES-CBC encryption algorithm in pycrypto for python","<p>When encryption is done using the AES-CBC algorithm, the encryption can be thought of as chaining the cipher texts with the previous ones and an IV. However, if its on CBC mode, we give our cipher text forward diffusive properties (i.e. if we change but i in our cipher, plaintext is change for all blocks after that). To make malleability attacks harder, one can chain the cipher texts during encryption on both directions (or implement something similar as in the bitLocker paper).</p>

<p>Does anyone know if there a implementation of pyCrypto that provides a chaining of the cipher texts using both direction?</p>

<p>One way that I thought of solving this was getting the original cipher text, reversing it using python and then feed it to pyCrypto. However, this seemed a little brute force because the whole point of pyCrypto is to take advantage of their C level implementation (while reversing a string would introduce a obvious unfortunate performance hit).</p>
","<p>No, as far as I know there are <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.Cipher.AES-module.html#MODE_ECB"" rel=""nofollow"">no modes in pyCrypto</a> that do this. This strong diffusion of the plaintext after an error in the ciphertext is called <em>error propagation</em>. Error propagation is nowadays not considered that important anymore; if you want to provide integrity of the plaintext then you add a MAC (say, <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.Hash.HMAC-module.html#new"" rel=""nofollow"">HMAC</a>) over the ciphertext instead, or you use an authenticated cipher (which basically provides integrity on top of confidentiality). Unfortunately I didn't see any authenticated cipher modes in pyCrypto.</p>

I'm new to Python (using 2.7) so I am having a hard time understading the input output data types. iv is generated with os.urandom(16), and I understand the output is random bytes. Is that the same as a byte string? the block_list is supposed to be 16 byte blocks of a message to encrypt (assuming no padding), where the msg is a plaintext string. When I encrypt, I want to xor a message block with a ciphertext block (I figured out how to do that with some added code) and then turn it back to a byte string.

I have read that this module cannot be loaded as it is not pure python, which is, aparently, not supported by Nifi.</p>

<p>Any suggestion of what can I use as an alternative to this module?</p>
","<p>It's not that NiFi doesn't support native Python modules per se, rather it is the Jython engine that we use in NiFi (as NiFi is a pure Java implementation) that does not support it. If you have a Python interpreter on the node(s) running NiFi, you could use <code>ExecuteStreamCommand</code> to shell out to Python using your script (with native imports), you'd get the contents of the flow file as <code>stdin</code> and you'd write your encrypt/decrypt logic to output to <code>stdout</code>, which would become the contents of the outgoing flow file.</p>

<p>I'm looking into a Py4J processor so we can get around Jython's limitation on native modules, but you'd still have to Bring Your Own Python (BYOP). For now, as long as you don't want to do anything more complex than taking in flow file content and writing out flow file content, ExecuteStreamCommand should do the trick.</p>

I get the keys from the IPFS configuration file as strings, so I will not explain this process here.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do:</p>

<pre><code>import base64, Crypto

publicKey = ""CAASpgIwgE ... jkupAgMBAAE=""
privateKey = ""CAASqQkwgg ... Xmzva/Km7A==""

publicKey = base64.b64decode(publicKey)
key = Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.import_key(publicKey)
crypter = Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEPPKCS1_OAEP.new(key)
encryptedData = crypter.encrypt(data.encode())
result = base64.b64encode(encryptedData).decode()
</code></pre>

<p>I get the following exception:</p>

<pre><code>key = Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.importKey(publicKey)
  File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/Crypto/PublicKey/RSA.py"", line 754, in import_key
    raise ValueError(""RSA key format is not supported"")
</code></pre>

<p>Similar problem with privateKey. In what format is the key and how to convert it to an acceptable format? </p>

<p>import_key function source code is there: <a href=""https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome/blob/master/lib/Crypto/PublicKey/RSA.py#L682"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome/blob/master/lib/Crypto/PublicKey/RSA.py#L682</a></p>
","<p>The solution was not as straightforward as it seemed to me at first glance.</p>

<p>For a start, you need to understand that the contents of the PrivateKey and PublicKey variables are not just a pure key encoded in Base64, it is a protobuf object serialized in ByteArray and then encoded in Base64. In order to get a key out of it, you first need to get a schema of this object, which is available by <a href=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-crypto/master/pb/crypto.proto"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reference</a>.</p>

<p>We save this file and follow the instructions on <a href=""https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this page</a>. In short, I ran the command <code>protoc --python_out=. crypto.proto</code> to create a Python module called <code>crypto_pb2.py</code>.</p>

<p>All preparations are complete and now go to the code:</p>

<pre><code>import crypto_pb2
import base64

publicKey = ""CAASpgIwgE ... jkupAgMBAAE=""
privateKey = ""CAASqQkwgg ... Xmzva/Km7A==""
</code></pre>

<p>You must first decode the base64 string to a byte array:</p>

<pre><code>decoded = base64.b64decode(publicKey) 
</code></pre>

<p>This function deserializes an array of bytes into a familiar Python protobuf object, I took it from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/44946680/7592204"">this answer</a> and modified a little:</p>

<pre><code>def deserialize(byte_message, proto_type):
    module_, class_ = proto_type.rsplit('.', 1)
    class_ = getattr(crypto_pb2, class_) # crypto_pb2 is a name of module we recently created and imported
    rv = class_()
    rv.ParseFromString(byte_message) # use .SerializeToString() to reverse operation
    return rv
</code></pre>

<p>Further we call the function, pass the decoded base64 and the name of the class to which it corresponds (<code>PublicKey</code> for <code>publicKey</code> and <code>PrivateKey</code> for <code>privateKey</code>), I'm interested in the <code>Data</code> property.</p>

<pre><code>publicKey = deserialize(decoded, 'crypto.pb.PublicKey').Data
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can transfer it to the import_key function as ByteArray. Do not perform additional conversions.</p>

<pre><code>key = Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.import_key(publicKey)
crypter = Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEPPKCS1_OAEP.new(key)
encryptedData = crypter.encrypt(data.encode())
result = base64.b64encode(encryptedData).decode()

<p><strong>Are there any good alternatives if not?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Help would be amazing guys!!!</p>
","<p>You'll need to build pycrypto before you upload it. This will need to be done on a machine with as similar an environment to your server as possible.</p>

<p>To build, run <code>python setup.py build</code> from inside the pycrypto-2.1.0 directory. This will create <code>build\lib.win32-2.6\Crypto</code> (the name of the libxxx directory might be a little different).</p>

<p>FTP the <code>Crypto</code> folder to somewhere on your server's python path. Inside the Django project folder may or may not work. A safe bet is to put it right in your <code>site-packages</code> folder, if you have access to it.</p>

<p>I don't know much about deploying on Windows, but usually you need to restart the server to reload the application whenever you make any changes. Hopefully that's what you meant by 'code refresh'</p>

","<p>It seems as though you're asking the question which inspired your title, about python verson 2.7.x, as a way to get insight into your <em>actual</em> problem, which is related to pycrypto. Tim's answer dealt with the question of which sub-versions of 2.7.x are supported.</p>

<p>It appears you're using both the app.yaml libraries stanza <em>and</em> pip to get an instance of pycrypto. So:</p>

<p>Is the pip-installed <code>pycrypto</code> residing on your dev-box somewhere like <code>/usr/local/lib/python-2.7</code>, or is it in the app's folder, specifically?</p>

<p>When the dev-server is running, is it possible your python path has it using the  <code>pycrypto</code> installed by pip on your system, with that <code>pycrypto</code> being a different version than the one in production? This might cause different behaviour on the dev-server vs. production.</p>

<hr>

<p>...All this said, it still seems odd, as Tim has pointed out, that you should see a disruption to logging based on this. What is it you're logging, and are you using any exception handling which might be dropping the responsibility to log?</p>

<p>Finally, is there a setting when running the dev-server which you can use that would <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/"" rel=""nofollow"">enable more verbosity</a>? Try that to see if you can raise the logging level enough to make the exceptions you're looking for visible.</p>

<p>These are my thoughts so far on how to get out of your jam. </p>

<p>Your expected value <code>b'\x00\x7e\x15\x16\x28\xae\xd2\xa6\xab\xf7\x15\x88\x09\xcf\x4f\x3c'</code> contains several ASCII characters that are printable, so Python shows those instead of the <code>\xhh</code> byte value:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; output = b'\x00\x7e\x15\x16\x28\xae\xd2\xa6\xab\xf7\x15\x88\x09\xcf\x4f\x3c'
&gt;&gt;&gt; output 
b'\x00~\x15\x16(\xae\xd2\xa6\xab\xf7\x15\x88\t\xcfO&lt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt; output == b'\x00\x7e\x15\x16\x28\xae\xd2\xa6\xab\xf7\x15\x88\x09\xcf\x4f\x3c'
True
</code></pre>

<p>The bytestring is still 16 bytes long:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; len(output)
16
</code></pre>

<p>That <code>~</code> is ASCII codepoint 126, or 0x7E in hexadecimal:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; output[1]
126
&gt;&gt;&gt; hex(output[1])
'0x7e'
</code></pre>

<p>The same applies to <code>\x28</code> and <code>(</code>, <code>\x09</code> and <code>\t</code> (the tab character escape sequence), <code>\x4f</code> and <code>O</code>, and <code>\x3c</code> and <code>&lt;</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>\xhh</code> escape sequence is just notation in a <code>bytes</code> object literal to define a given byte value, but you can produce the exact same value with <code>~</code>. Ditto for <code>\t</code>, you can express that same value as <code>\x09</code>, but Python prefers using the <code>\t</code> sequence when showing the representation.</p>

<pre><code>cipher = Blowfish(self.masterKey)
cipher.initCTR()

<p>can someone help me?</p>
","<p>First, a few warnings:</p>

<ol>
<li>Blowfish is not a secure cipher by today's standard. Use AES.</li>
<li>Counter mode (CTR) is not secure because it does not detect malicious modification of the encrypted data. Use other modes like GCM, CCM or EAX.</li>
<li>Counter mode really requires a random IV for every message. However, you are using a fixed IV fixed which is <strong>very wrong</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>To answer your question, you should initialize the cipher as:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Util import Counter

ctr = Counter.new(64, initial_value=0, little_endian=True)
cipher = Blowfish.new(self.masterKey, Blowfish.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr)
</code></pre>

<p>The Counter object is documented <a href=""https://www.pycryptodome.org/en/latest/src/util/util.html#crypto-util-counter-module"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. It allows the definition of a little-endian counter (typically CTR is big-endian).</p>

<p>NOTE: <a href=""https://github.com/MyNameIsMeerkat/EncryptedYAML/blob/master/blowfish.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>blowfish.py</code></a> encrypts differently in big-endian machines than on little-endian ones.</p>

"18596577","Why is decryption failing after separate writes to this file-like object?","<p>I'm working on a toy module to encrypt tempfiles.  The idea is to expose an interface similar to that found in the <code>tempfile</code> module, but to have data transparently encrypted using session keys.  Again, it's just a toy project and not production code.</p>

<p>First, a few technical details.  This project is implemented with <code>pycrypto</code> and is employing:</p>

<ul>
<li>AES-CTR</li>
<li>A counter with a 1-bit randomized prefix</li>
</ul>

<p>The basic class is structured so as to mimic the file object interface.  When a method such as <code>read</code> or <code>write</code> is called, we initialize a <code>Crypto.Cipher.AES</code> object using the class' <code>_cipher</code> property.  This property is implemented as follows:</p>

<pre><code>def _cipher():
    doc = doc = ""Returns a stateful AES object ready to decrypt at the required \
                 stream position""

    def fget(self):
        ctr = Counter.new(nbits=64,
                          initial_value=self.tell()  # alias of self._file.tell
                          prefix=self._nonce)  # set by `Random.new().read(8)
        return AES.new(self._key, counter=ctr, mode=self._opmode)  # self._opmode = Crypto.Cipher.AES.MODE_CTR

    def fset(self, value):
        raise AttributeError('Cannot set _cipher')

    def fdel(self, value):
        raise AttributeError('Cannot delete _cipher')

    return locals()
        _cipher = property(**_cipher())
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example of how the <code>_cipher</code> property is used to encrypt transparently during a call to the <code>write</code> method.</p>

<pre><code>def write(self, data):
    if not isinstance(data, str):
        raise TypeError('Data must be str (or bytestring)')
    self._file.write(self._cipher.encrypt(data))
</code></pre>

<p>When decrypting, we apply the opposite transaction as such:</p>

<pre><code>def read(self, size=-1):
    return self._cipher.decrypt(self._file.read(size))
</code></pre>

<p>This works when making single calls to <code>write</code>, but fails when multiple calls to <code>write</code> are chained.  For instance:</p>

<pre><code>ep = EphemeralFile()  # the class in question
ep.write('Now is the winter of our discontent')
ep.seek(0)
print ep.read()

&gt;&gt; Now is the winter of our discontent
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good... but here's where it fails</p>

<pre><code>ep.write(' made glorious summer by this sun of York')
ep.seek(0)
print ep.read()

&gt;&gt; Now is the winter of our discontent""d_""��U�L~ �w���S��h��]""U(��P^��9k
</code></pre>

<p>What am I doing wrong?  Shouldn't the use of <code>self._file.tell()</code> in the <code>_cipher</code> property yield the appropriate counter position for decryption?</p>

<p>Please note that I first suspected that I might be off by one counter tick, so I tried modifying the <code>initial_value=self.tell()</code> line to <code>initial_value=self.tell() + 1</code> (also tried with <code>-1</code>), but to no avail.</p>

<p>At this point I really don't see where the problem is, so please feel free to nag me with questions and suggest possible solutions.</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance!</p>
","<p>I believe one problem is that the <code>Counter</code> object should receive as <code>initial_value</code> the AES block number, not the byte offset. In other words, you need to have:</p>

<pre><code>ctr = Counter.new(nbits=64,
                  initial_value=self.tell() % 16,
                  prefix=self._nonce)
</code></pre>

<p>That's needed because in AES CTR mode you increase the value each time you cross the AES data boundary (16 bytes).</p>

<p>That also means that the correct sequence for any <code>write</code> operation roughly is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start the cipher object as shown above - in encryption mode.</li>
<li>Encrypt <code>self.tell() % 16</code> bytes of any data and throw away the result.</li>
<li>Encrypt the input data and write it to the file.</li>
</ol>

<p>Similarly for reading:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start the cipher object as shown above - in decryption mode.</li>
<li>Decrypt <code>self.tell() % 16</code> bytes of any data and throw away the result.</li>
<li>Decrypt the data read from the file.</li>
</ol>

<p><strike>From a quick look at the code, a second problem could also be that you use the same AES object for both encryption and decryption. You need two separate objects, one for each direction.</strike></p>

<p>I tried to encode a sample file and it raised this ValueError . Then I try to work with a file which contain only one char directly on the Python interpreter. Encryption worked well but decryption broke with the same error as above.</p>
","<p>The main problem with the code is the use of newline characters to separate the chunks of encrypted data.  The encrypted data may already contain newline characters, so attempting to split the encrypted data into lines may produce partial chunks, which will raise the <code>ValueError</code> that you see when decrypted.</p>

<p>A second problem is that the encrypted files are being opened in text mode.  When dealing with encrypted data open files in binary mode.  Encrypted <code>bytes</code> are unlikely to be decodable to <code>str</code>, so using text mode will result in encoding or decoding errors.</p>

<p>Rather than splitting the encrypted data on newlines, this code reads from the file in chunks of 256 bytes, as the encryption process seems to generate 256 bytes for each chunk of input.

<p>And this is the source of the problem: you're assuming each character is <em>one</em> byte long, but that's not the case.</p>

<p>You can generate a random IV of N bytes with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>import os

N = 16
IV = os.urandom(N)
</code></pre>

<p>Another issue in your code is that you're opening all your files in <code>'rb'</code> mode, which stands for ""read binary"", but attempting to write to it instances of <code>str</code>, like your <code>IV</code>. That won't work because in this mode you're only allowed to read and write <code>bytes</code>, not <code>str</code>. In my solution for calculating the <code>IV</code> this issue completely disappears.</p>

<pre><code>from setuptools import setup

setup(

&gt; sudo cat /tmp/clear.txt | openssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin -inkey veeip2.pub &gt; /tmp/encrypted.txt
# ""clear.txt"" contains ""foo""
# ""encrypted.txt"" is always 256 bytes long, which is correct.

<p>There seems to be a loss (or an addition??) somewhere between the client and the server, related to padding. But for the life of me, I have no idea what it could be.

<p>The program performs fine if I directly use the dataframe to perform decryption without storing it in csv file.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time. </p>
","<p>When encrypting, the salt is stored as <em>bytes</em> literal in the csv-file. When decrypting, the salt is interpreted as a <em>string</em> literal, which factually means that a different salt and thus a different key is used. The wrong decryption also leads to an invalid padding, which results in the error message <em>Padding is incorrect</em>. </p>

<p>The different salts during encryption and decryption can be easily checked with the debugger by comparing the value and type of <code>key_salt_pair[1]</code> in <code>encrypt_cols</code> and (the corresponding) <code>encrypted_dict['salt'][index]</code> in <code>decrypt_cols</code>.</p>

<p>The determination of the original salt is easiest if it is stored as a hexadecimal string, and can be implemented in <code>get_private_key_salt</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def get_private_key_salt(password, salt=None):
    if salt == None:
        saltBin = os.urandom(16)
        salt = saltBin.hex()
    else:                             
        saltBin = bytes.fromhex(salt)    

    kdf = PBKDF2(password, saltBin, 64, 100000)
    key = kdf[:32]

    return [key,salt]
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, the change can also be made in <code>encrypt_cols</code> and <code>decrypt_cols</code>.</p>

<p>Another point is: In the current code, the csv-files still have the <code>DataFrame</code>-column. This can be removed by setting the index-parameter in <code>pandas#DataFrame#to_csv</code> to <code>False</code>, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/36572039/9014097"">here</a>. </p>

<p>I have completed the backend python code which will import modules from OpenSSL.Crypto library.. </p>

<p>How to execute the same in client side?.. i.e signing operation should be done in client side, </p>

<p>In google i found like Brython, skulpt, pyjams help in this.. But i m confused to start.. Any suggestions?</p>
","<p>So, first things first: it is not usueal to have the same code to run on server side and client side.</p>

<p>Second thing: be aware that no authentication (or ""signing"") done on client side can be regarded as safe. At most, the client side can take care of closely coupling the signing with the UI to give the user dynamic feedback - but since whatever requests the client side send to the server can very easily be impersonated by an script, authentication <strong>must</strong> be performed server side for each request -  for example, a variable saying the current user has authenticated correctly can just be sent as ""True"", regardless of usernames and passwords actually known.</p>

<p>Third thing: despite all this, since there are these frameworks for using Python or a Python like language client side, it is indeed possible to have some modules in  a code base that are used both client side and server side. Of those, I am most familiar with Brython which has achieved a nice level of Python 3.x compatibility and I indeed have a project sharing code client side and server side.   </p>

<p>The re-used code would have to be refactored to abstract any I/O (like getting user input, or getting values from a database), of couse, since these are fundamentally different things on server side, and client side. Still, some core logic can be in place that is reused both sides. </p>

<p>However third party python modules, like Pycrypto won't work client side (you could probably code a xmlrpc/jsonrpc like call to use it server side) -
and although Python's hashlib is not implemented now in Brython, the project has got a momentum that opening a feature request for at least the same codecs that exist in javascript could be fulfilled in a matter of days. 
(bugs/features requests can be open at github.com/brython-dev/brython)</p>

<p>(PS. I just found out, to my dismay, that currently there is no standard way to compute any hash, not even md5, in Javascript without third party modules - that just emphasize the utilities of frameworks like Brython or coffescript which can bring up a bundle of functionality in a clean way)</p>

<p>For instance, if I wanted to encrypt <code>123456789</code>, then the resulting plain text of the encrypted data should be the same no matter which machine I use to encrypt the data.

<p>Next, I went to <a href=""http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#pycrypto"" rel=""nofollow"">VoidSpace</a> and downloaded PyCrypto 2.6 for Python 2.7 64bit (<code>pycrypto-2.6.win-amd64-py2.7.exe</code>).

<pre><code>The installation file has to be ""Run as administrator.""

<p>In other words, right click the file name and select ""Run as administrator.""</p>

<p>It's as simple as that.</p>

<p>Here's what I did to figure that out:</p>

<p>Looking at the StackOverflow post, <em><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11405549/how-do-i-install-pycrypto-on-windows"">How do I install PyCrypto on Windows?</a></em>, I noticed some suggestions to run the installation file using <code>easy_install</code>, so I tried that. (<code>easy_install</code> is in the <code>Python27\Scripts</code> folder.) That gave me a long error message, which said something about signing in as an administrator. I am the administrator, but this gave me the idea that maybe the file wants to run as an administrator. So I tried that and Voila! The installation proceeded to completion.</p>

<p>I don’t know if there’s a reason that I had to do that and other people don’t have to. I've sent an e-mail to Michael at VoidSpace suggesting that he add a note near the download links suggesting that it be run that way.</p>

","<p>The easiest way I can think of introducing some noise to the <code>encoded</code> string is to alter every nth character in it. You can play around with string manipulation to introduce more or less random noise (make the nth a random character, change it on every iteration, etc).</p>

<p>Add this function and imports somewhere before your code:</p>

<pre><code>import string
import random

def noise_every_n(input, n, first=0):
    output = """"
    for i, c in enumerate(input, -first):
        if i % n == 0: # using ascii_letters and digits is just what came to mind, there's other ways to get random characters.
            output += random.choice(string.ascii_letters + string.digits)
        else:
            output += c
    return output
</code></pre>

<p>Then call the following between <code>encode</code> and <code>decode</code>:</p>

<pre><code>every_n = random.randint(3, 5) # or just set it to a small integer
encoded = noise_every_n(encoded, every_n) 
</code></pre>

"48631472","Key Kollision in DES3 Implementation of PyCrypto","<p>I'm pretty new to cryptography and only a user really. I stumbled however over a very interesting ""vulnerability"" of the DES3 Cipher of the PyCrypto library. </p>

<p>I experimented with generating Private Keys and encrypting them with DES3. Everything is fine with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import DES3
from Crypto import Random

random_generator = Random.new().read
key = RSA.generate(1024,random_generator)
public_key = key.publickey()
enc_data = public_key.encrypt('abcdefgh', 32)

exported_key = key.exportKey('PEM', '12345678abcdefgh', pkcs=1)
print(exported_key)
imported_key = RSA.importKey(exported_key,'12345678abcdefgi')

print(imported_key.exportKey('PEM'))
</code></pre>

<p>Note the minor change in the passphrase when importing the key. As expected, the result of the import is a fail, as the Private Key can not be decrypted correctly with the 16 byte passphrase provided. When I change the passphrase to the correct one, everything is fine.</p>

<p>However, when I experimented with encrypting something with DES3 (the standard encryption used in passphrase encrypting in this code), I stumbled accross something.</p>

<p>Regard the code:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import DES3

des = DES3.new(""12345678abcdefgh"")
secret = des.encrypt(""1234abcd"")
print(secret)

des2 = DES3.new(""12345678abcdefgi"")
result = des2.decrypt(secret)
print(result)
</code></pre>

<p>Which produces the following result:</p>

<pre><code>��@e���
1234abcd
</code></pre>

<p>I can decode the message despite having an unauthorized key. For every other change I have tried so far (""12345678absdefgj"" e.g.), encryption works as expected.</p>

<p>Is this a vulnerability in the DES3 cipher, an incorrect implementation or a fault in my ""experiment""?</p>

(using <a href=""http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/aes.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/aes.js</a>)</p>
","<h1>1. Sending public key to the client</h1>

<p>The client only needs the public key to encrypt something that the server can then decrypt. An RSA public key is made up of the modulus <em>n</em> and the public exponent <em>e</em>. The easy way would be to send both parts as hex-encoded strings.</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>modulus = hex(key.publickey().n)[2:-1]
exponent = hex(key.publickey().e)[2:-1]
</code></pre>

<h1>2. Using public key to encrypt</h1>

<p>CryptoJS doesn't provide an RSA implementation, but <a href=""http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/"" rel=""nofollow"">jsbn</a> (<a href=""https://github.com/jasondavies/jsbn"" rel=""nofollow"">GitHub</a>) does. It's a good thing that we sent the public components as hex, because jsbn expects the modulus and public exponent as hex-encoded strings:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>var rsa = new RSA();
rsa.setPublic(n_string, e_string);
var res = rsa.encrypt(plaintext);
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that RSA can only encrypt data that is not bigger as the modulus. If you generate 1024-bit keys, then you can't encrypt data bigger than 1024-bit. If you want to encrypt bigger data, you need <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_cryptosystem"" rel=""nofollow"">Hybrid Encryption</a> with for example AES.</p>

<p>jsbn also only uses PKCS#1 v1.5 padding which pycrypto supports. You can try the non-yet merged <a href=""https://github.com/jasondavies/jsbn/pull/3"" rel=""nofollow"">pull request #3</a> to get PKCS#1 v2 OAEP which is more secure than v1.5 padding.</p>

<h1>3. Decryption in python</h1>

<p>jsbn returns a hex-encoded ciphertext. You can safely send it as you wish, but you need to decode (not shown) it to bytes before decryption in python.</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>sentinel = Random.new().read(32) # denotes the error result of the decryption 
cipher = PKCS1_v1_5.new(key) # private key
message = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext, sentinel)
if sentinel != message:
    print(""success: "" + str(message))

<ol>
<li>Create a RSA keyset for both the sender and the receiver and a seperate AES key</li>
<li>The sender:

<ol>
<li>Encrypts the message with the AES key using the ECB encryption mode ECB</li>
<li>Encrypts the AES key with the senders private key</li>
<li>Concats their own name to the result of the last step</li>
<li>Encrypts the result from the last step with the receivers public key</li>
<li>Combines the results from step 1 and 4 into 1 message and sends it to the receiver</li>
</ol></li>
<li>And the receiver

<ol>
<li>Splits the message into the actual message and the double encrypted key (which also contains the senders name)</li>
<li>Decrypts the double encrypted key using their own private key</li>
<li>Uses the name of the sender to retrieve the senders public key</li>
<li>Decrypts the AES key with the senders public key</li>
<li>Decrypts the message with the AES key</li>

","<p>First, in a secure crypto system, you should <em>expect</em> the output to be different every time you encrypt, even using the same code. That fact that yours doesn't indicates it's an insecure cipher. Typically this is done by adding a random IV.</p>

<p>Your IV is ""11869021012"", which is horrible (because it's not random, and not even 16 bytes), but it does seem you're using it the same way in both, so that's fine.</p>

<p>Your password is the SHA-256 of a string, which is a horrible way to create a key, but still, you seem to be doing it the same way in both cases, so that's fine.</p>

<p>Your problem is that the Python code emits the IV followed by the cipher text. Your JS code does not emit the IV; it only emits the cipher text. So you probably meant this in the Python:</p>

<pre><code>return base64.b64encode(cipher.encrypt(cleartext))
</code></pre>

<p>Or you need to rework the JavaScript to glue together the IV and the cipher text before Base64 encoding.</p>

<p>How does crypto change logging and how can I fix it so that I can use logging normally again in my python app?</p>

<p>Update1:</p>

<p>It seems that some python errors are also not displayed in the logging from app engine, as well as correct python code also giving a '500 internal server error' which is only visible in a browser console when testing the app in localhost.</p>

<p>Update2:</p>

<p>I have completely disabled any imports of Python Crypto ( which is provide by Google App Engine ), and now my logging works correctly, displaying all my own testing logging lines and python errors. This of course does not solve the problem as I need the Crypto module. Using Crypto in this case blocks the ability to test any code because you can not see errors in the logging.</p>

<p>To be clear, I have included the crypto library in app.yaml exactly as instructed by Google App Engine docs. The crypto library itself works fine, the problem is that it breaks logging in my python app engine app.</p>

<p>the results for both the cases is different but after decryption they both tend to give the same correct result.</p>

<p>what might be the issue here?</p>
","<p>You didn't specify what different results are you getting but those two should produce same-ish result. The only difference I see is in the base64 alphabet you're using.</p>

<p>In Python you're calling <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/base64.html#base64.urlsafe_b64encode"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>base64.urlsafe_b64encode()</code></a> which differs from the <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3548.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong><em>standard</em> Base64</strong></a> in what characters it uses for values for <code>62</code> and <code>63</code> (<code>-</code> and <code>_</code> instead of <code>+</code> and <code>/</code>). To get the same result, either in Python return:</p>

<pre><code>return base64.b64encode(encrypted)
</code></pre>

<p>Or post-process the base64 encoded string in Node.js:</p>

<pre><code>encoded = encoded.replace(/_/g, '/').replace(/-/g, '+');
</code></pre>

<p>All this being said, as I've mentioned in my comment, never derive an IV from your password/key (or anything else deterministic and unchanging). Use a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cryptographically secure PRNG</a> for it.</p>

","<p>Although you cannot find a unique mapping from a hashing and the data it was generated to, you can still maintain a database describing mappings between certain data and their hash.
By doing a reverse research on the hash, you can find instances of data that would produce the particular hash you are looking for (if you get a match in your database).</p>

<p>Of course the database could have no match or contain multiple matches of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hash</a>, because of the mathematical definition of a hash as being <strong>unilateral</strong>.</p>

","<p>Cryptographic hash functions like SHA2, SHA3, Shake, Blake2, etc. are all one-way functions. They can hash arbitrary length inputs to a fixed size like 256 in SHA-256. Due to the pigeon principle, there are <strong>collisions</strong> and they are <strong>inevitable</strong>. But we expect to find if hard. We expect them to have;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>preimage-resistance</strong> — for essentially all pre-specified outputs, it is computationally infeasible to find any input which hashes to that output, i.e., to find any preimage <code>x'</code> such that <code>h(x') = y</code> when given any y for which a corresponding input is not known.</li>
<li><strong>2nd-preimage resistance, weak-collision</strong> — it is computationally infeasible to find any second input which has the same output as any specified input, i.e., given <code>x</code>, to find a 2nd-preimage <code>x' != x</code> such that <code>h(x) = h(x')</code>.</li>
<li><strong>collision resistance, strong-collision</strong> — it is computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs <code>x</code>, <code>x'</code> which hash to the same output, i.e., such that <code>h(x) = h(x')</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In your case, it is the pre-image attack. Generic pre-image attacks on cryptographic hash functions have <code>O(2^x)</code>-time complexity where <code>x</code> is the output length of the hash function. In SHA-256 <code>O(2^256)</code></p>

<p>The web site you have mentioned <strong>has a trick</strong>, then you want to SHA256 hash some text, they immediately store it on their database. When you asked about the hash value that you got from their site, they search for it on their database. It exists since they store it when you asked the hash value. So, you helped them to increase the hashes of their DB. They only have <code>6,128,202,407 sha256 hash database</code> which is a tiny amount compared to possible outputs od SHA-256 that is <code>2^256</code></p>

<p>I have also found some ideas in stackoverflow. but can't able to understand very well.</p>
","<p>The way you have configured this cipher is highly insecure. <strong>DO NOT USE THIS CODE.</strong></p>

<p>By setting:</p>

<pre><code>counter = lambda : iv
</code></pre>

<p>while initializing the AES cipher in Python, you have forced AES-CTR to use the exact same counter for every block. This reduces the cipher from AES-CTR to a simple rolling XOR. Observe:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; key = ""abcd1234abcd1234""
&gt;&gt;&gt; iv = '\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0'
&gt;&gt;&gt; encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter = lambda : iv)
&gt;&gt;&gt; encryptor.encrypt(""example block 01"")
'\xda\x7f\x00\xbdp\x1c\xe4\xf3=|\x88\xe2\xe5%\x80\xab'
&gt;&gt;&gt; encryptor.encrypt(""example block 01"")
'\xda\x7f\x00\xbdp\x1c\xe4\xf3=|\x88\xe2\xe5%\x80\xab'
&gt;&gt;&gt; encryptor.encrypt(""example block 02"")
'\xda\x7f\x00\xbdp\x1c\xe4\xf3=|\x88\xe2\xe5%\x80\xa8'
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Encrypting the same block repeatedly results in the same output.</p></li>
<li><p>Encrypting similar blocks results in similar output. (Technically, <code>a XOR b = E(a) XOR E(b)</code>.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To fix this, you need to use the <code>Counter</code> class you have already imported:</p>

<pre><code>encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=Counter.new(128))
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have configured AES-CTR correctly, your existing Java code should be able to decrypt it.</p>

<p>However, note that <strong>this mode is still insecure</strong> if the same key is reused to encrypt multiple files. You must use a different key for every file.</p>

The script automatically runs a couple of times a day and reads the login information for the server from a YAML configuration file.
For security reasons, I want to encrypt the YAML file so that nobody form outside (internet) or inside (my roommates) can read the file and steal the login information without permission. So far, I've come up with a script that uses PyCrypto for AES encryption and decryption.</p>

<p>I don't get how to securely hide the key (used to encrypt and decrypt) the YAML config. Can somebody recommend a good strategy?
The script needs to have access each time it is scheduled to run, in order to get the login information. Providing the key manually is thus not very handy.</p>

<p>This is the equivalent Python version that Im trying to create:</p>

<ol>
<li>If a passphrase has been used instead of a key then It will use AES
256 by default. </li>
<li>The mode is CBC.</li>
<li>The padding is PKCS7.</li>
</ol>

<p>However Pycrypto by default is forcing me to use a 16 bytes IV not a 32 as the documentation from CryptoJS proposed..so Im a bit confused on the correct way to do the decryption here..

"50412705","How to reduce the length of a message encrypted with Hybrid encryption","<p>I was looking for a good encryption scheme to encrypt my message and i founded that the Hybrid encryption is good for large and small messages. but i have a problem with the length of the output cipher message which is large.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if the input was ""hello"", then the length of the output message will be 586, and twice if if the message larger</p>
</blockquote>

<p>here is the Encrypt function that i use:</p>

<pre><code>def encrypt(username, msg):
    #get the reciever's public key
    f = open(""{}.pem"".format(username)) # a.salama.pem
    recipient_key = RSA.import_key(f.read())
    f.close()

    # Encrypt the session key with the reciever's public RSA key
    cipher_rsa = PKCS1_OAEP.new(recipient_key)

    # Encrypt the data with the AES128 session key
    session_key = get_random_bytes(16)  
    cipher_aes = AES.new(session_key, AES.MODE_EAX)
    ciphertext, tag = cipher_aes.encrypt_and_digest(msg)

    #finishing your processing
    encrypted_data = cipher_rsa.encrypt(session_key) + cipher_aes.nonce + tag +  ciphertext 
    encrypted_data = hexlify(encrypted_data).decode(""utf-8"")
    return encrypted_data
</code></pre>
","<p>There's a fixed number of extra bytes in the header regardless of the amount of plaintext being encrypted. That's evident from your line of code</p>

<pre><code>encrypted_data = cipher_rsa.encrypt(session_key) + cipher_aes.nonce + tag +  ciphertext 
</code></pre>

<p>This extra data will be dominated by the RSA-encrypted session key. A more space-efficient choice would be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Encryption_Scheme"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ECIES</a> using a well-known 256-bit elliptic curve.</p>

<p>However, you also have expansion of the data due to encoding. Your choice of encoding is hex encoding which <strong>doubles</strong> the amount of data. A more efficient and well-supported encoding is base64 encoding. Base64 encoding expands the data by a factor of 4/3. The most space-efficient is avoid encoding altogether and just store and transmit raw bytes. You only need to encode the data if it will transit over channel that cannot handle binary data. </p>

    iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    return base64.b64encode(iv + cipher.encrypt(pad(str(tupla))))

def pad(s):

<p>I have also the decrypt function written in python:</p>

    text = base64.b64decode(ciphertext)

    dec = cipher.decrypt(text[16:]).decode('utf-8')
    return dec
</code></pre>

<p>And it works fine, but I need to decrypt this ciphertext with nodejs.</p>

<p>The encryption key is this:</p>

<pre><code>key = b'\x13\xe3`X\x06J\x0b\x04\xeb\xc4\x82\xbdV\\\x83\xb7'
</code></pre>

<p>I tried everything but I cannot make it work.
I followed <a href=""https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/70518/how-to-decrypt-aes-256-in-node-js"">this example</a> but nothing...</p>

<pre><code>var crypto = require('crypto');

password = 'abcabcabc1abcabcabc1abcabcabc132';
var cryptoStr = 'Q336OpFur65nt1NgGUebbgx5hmwpcH3iUEd4mXq8qVwXL91qpLSaFecgKpsVvQEiT0DOMwK3TpUksPnjbr3wKA==';

var buf = new Buffer(cryptoStr, 'base64');
var iv = buf.toString('binary', 0, 16);
var crypt = buf.toString('base64', 16);

var decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv('aes-256-cbc', password, iv);
decipher.setAutoPadding(false);
var dec = decipher.update(crypt,'base64','utf-8');
dec += decipher.final('utf-8'); 

console.log('Decrypted content: ' + dec);
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>My nodejs decrypt function is this:</p>

<pre><code>var buf = new Buffer(data, 'base64');
var keyBuff = new Buffer('\x13\xe3`X\x06J\x0b\x04\xeb\xc4\x82\xbdV\\\x83\xb7');
var iv = buf.toString('binary', 0, 16);
var crypt = buf.toString('base64', 16);
var decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv('aes-128-cbc', keyBuff, iv);
decipher.setAutoPadding(false);
var dec = decipher.update(crypt,'base64','utf-8');
dec += decipher.final('utf-8'); 
</code></pre>

<p>But it does not work... it throws this error: </p>

<pre><code>Invalid IV length
</code></pre>
","<p>Here what I did to solve the problem:</p>

<p>I took the key:</p>

<pre><code>key = b'\x13\xe3`X\x06J\x0b\x04\xeb\xc4\x82\xbdV\\\x83\xb7'
</code></pre>

<p>And on the python shell I converted it to base64 with this command:</p>

<pre><code>base64.b64encode(b'\x13\xe3`X\x06J\x0b\x04\xeb\xc4\x82\xbdV\\\x83\xb7')
</code></pre>

<p>The result was this:</p>

<pre><code>b'E+NgWAZKCwTrxIK9VlyDtw=='
</code></pre>

<p>Then I copied this string without the first character ('b') and I pasted it inside my nodeJs script replacing the old key.</p>

<p>I also changed the code of the decrypt function, this is the new one:</p>

<pre><code>function decypherData(data){
    var buf = new Buffer(data, 'base64');
    var key = new Buffer('E+NgWAZKCwTrxIK9VlyDtw==', 'base64');
    var iv = buf.slice(0, 16);
    var crypt = buf.slice(16);
    var decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv('aes-128-cbc', key, iv);
    decipher.setAutoPadding(false);
    var dec = decipher.update(crypt,'base64','utf-8');
    dec += decipher.final('utf-8'); 
    return dec;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I'm not using the old key anymore, instead I'm using the base64 version.</p>

<p>Here the output of the decryption:</p>

Pycrypto can be built but it won't run properly. The workaround is to avoid firebase (which requires pycrypto) altogether. Use requests and json instead for simple get and post methods. </p>

<p><code>configure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH</code>
 
when running <code>make docker-build</code> 
(after placing <code>pycrypto==2.6.1</code> at <code>requirements.txt</code> file).</p>

<p>There's <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19816275/no-acceptable-c-compiler-found-in-path-when-installing-python"">this thread</a> and someone said about the same problem:
 </p>

<p>""The gcc compiler is not in your $PATH. It means either you dont have gcc installed or it's not in your $PATH variable"".</p>

<p>So tried placing <code>apt-get install build-essential</code> at Dockerfile, but I got</p>

<p><code>/bin/sh: apt-get: command not found</code></p>

<p>Then, I tried with <code>yum install gcc</code></p>

<p>only to get</p>

There are also a set of build images that include packages like gcc-c++, git, zip and the aws-cli for compiling and deploying.

<p>So I guess I shouldn't be needing to install gcc. Maybe the gcc compiler is not in $PATH, but I don't know what to do to fix that.</p>

<pre><code>./toolchain.py build pycrypto

"56733079","Encrypt data with accents using python crypto library","<p>I am implementing DES3 in Python using Crypto library. I was doing some test when I’ve stumbled upon the next problem: </p>

<p>If the plain text that I want to encrypt contains strange charactes, as accents, fails. </p>

<p>For example, my code is working fine when I try to encrypt the next word: </p>

<p>Text to be encrypted(multiple of 8 in length) : <code>""Hello Jose      ""</code></p>

<p>However, it fails if I try to encrypt the same text but containing an accent:
Text to be encrypted (multiple of 8 in length)= <code>""Hello José      ""</code></p>

<p>The error that I am getting is “ValueError: Input strings must be a multiple of 8 in length”.</p>

<p>If I check the length of the word, it is a multiple of 8. </p>

<pre><code>plaintext=""Hello Jose      ""
print("" Plain text:"" + plaintext)
print("" Plain Text length:"" + str(len(plaintext)))
</code></pre>

<p>Result: Plain Text length : 16</p>

<p>Find next a reduced example of my code: </p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import DES3
import binascii
import base64

plaintext=""Hello Jose      ""
print("" Plain text:"" + plaintext)
print("" Plain Text length:"" + str(len(plaintext)))

#### ENCRYPTION 
key ='173JKL3D93A9CNI1G6NP9A14'
key=bytes(key, 'utf-8')
plaintext_bytes=bytes(plaintext, 'utf-8')
print("" Plain Text length:"" + str(len(plaintext_bytes)))


cipher_encrypt=DES3.new(key)
encrypted_text=cipher_encrypt.encrypt(plaintext_bytes)
print( "" Encrypted word:"" + str(encrypted_text))

#### DECRYPTION
cipher_encrypt=DES3.new(key)
decrypted_text=cipher_encrypt.decrypt(encrypted_text)
print("" Decripted text:"" + str(decrypted_text,'utf-8') + ""\n"")
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone help me to understand why it is not working correctly?</p>
","<p>Goyo is right. The algorithm reads the plain text as a byte-string. Knowing that, the length in bytes of one character with accent is 2. See next example: </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; a='a'
&gt;&gt; print(""length:"" + str(len(a.encode('utf-8'))))
length:1
</code></pre>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; a='á'
&gt;&gt; print(""length:"" + str(len(a.encode('utf-8'))))
length:2
</code></pre>

<p>So, firstly you have to encode the text to bytes and then calculate the length. </p>

<p>What you could do is calculate the next multiple of 8 and that should be the length of the plain text. After that, you could fill out the string with whitespace to that length. </p>

<p>I am using tcpdump to get the packet information for the connection and there is a sequence number (code shown below), but it does not seem to work.

For my decryption I want to decrypt packet by packet, so now my question is:</p>

My strategy is to write <code>seal</code> and <code>open_seal</code> below to handle en(de)cryption of data as a single byte array.

<p>The program works when doing 1 whole chunk. For large files, I'd call <code>dark</code> to encrypt, which works by calling <code>seal</code> on each chunk read off the stream.

"42883438","Python DES encryption strange behavior","<p>I have a text file containing the following text:</p>

<h1>message.txt</h1>

<pre><code>this is my secret message
</code></pre>

<p>I wrote a small python code to read that file and encode it using <code>Crypto.Cipher</code></p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import DES
f = open('message.txt','rb')
text = f.read()
f.close()

iv   = Random.get_random_bytes(8)
des1 = DES.new('01234567', DES.MODE_CFB, iv)

secret = des1.encrypt(text)  
print(""Encrypted text: "" + secret)   
</code></pre>

<h1>output:</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Encrypted text: Å..GH.ÿì.Vs~ö.~.wôÇ.k5â</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I then saved the output string to a text file:</p>

<pre><code>w = open('encrypted.txt','wb')
w.write(secret)
w.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Then I tried to open the same encrypted file and decrypt the content back to its original message:</p>

<pre><code>d = open('encrypted.txt','rb')
secret = d.read()
d.close()

text = des1.decrypt(secret)
print(""decreypted text is: "" + text)
</code></pre>

<h1>output:</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>decrypted text is: óF2â.}1Úmy secret message</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is very strange that the encryption works partially. I was under the impression that you would either encryption would produce the whole original message intact, or it would yield an unreadable gibberish text. But never expected a mixture of the two.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>*Edit: I have edited my question: I always read binary and write binary. The half decrypted output happens when I read/write binary. When I don't read binary, the output is completely gibberish.</p>

"57048483","Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.generate with randfunc set to read from mouse input","<p>When generating a new RSA private key with the randfunc set to a custom function that reads from /dev/input/mice, it continuously reads and never stops.</p>

<p>I've tried feeding the raw MOUSEFILE.read function instead of my wrapper but that didn't help. However, by feeding pre-read data from mouse input into a function that uses random.choice to select random bytes from said data, it works fine.</p>

<p>Variables:</p>

<p><code>MOUSEFILE = open(""/dev/input/mice"",""rb"")</code></p>

<p>My end goal (doesn't work for some reason):</p>

<pre><code>def randfunc(n):
    return MOUSEFILE.read(n)```

<p>The pre-read function with random.choice that works:</p>

        res += bytes([random.choice(MOUSEDATA)])

<p>I can confirm that my randfunc is actually reading from mouse input correctly by throwing a couple print statements in there. It appears to be in a continuous loop of reading 1 and then 63 bytes from the randfunc. My randfunc2 works perfectly, but I want to get randfunc to work and read from live mouse movements. The function I use to generate the key is:</p>

<pre><code>k = RSA.generate(1024, randfunc=x)

","<p>The only bytes that you should treat as a string are the bytes that have been encoded as a string in the first place. As ciphertext contains random bytes, there will likely be bytes that do not represent a character - almost any encoding has unused / reserved byte values and / or unprintable characters. If you want to convert ciphertext to actual text, you should use a (binary-to-text) encoding such as base 64.</p>
