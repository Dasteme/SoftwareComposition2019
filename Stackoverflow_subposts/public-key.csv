","<p><strong>the user have not generated a ssh public/private key pair set before ?</strong></p>

<p>This info is working on theChaw but can be applied to all other git repositories which support SSH pubkey authentications. (See <a href=""https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite"" rel=""noreferrer"">gitolite</a>, gitlab or github for example.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First start by setting up your own public/private key pair set. This
  can use either DSA or RSA, so basically any key you setup will work.
  On most systems you can use ssh-keygen.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>First you'll want to cd into your .ssh directory. Open up the terminal and run:
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><code>cd ~/.ssh &amp;&amp; ssh-keygen</code></p>
  </blockquote></li>
  <li>Next you need to copy this to your clipboard.
  
  <ul>
  <li>On OS X run: <code>cat id_rsa.pub | pbcopy</code> </li>
  <li>On Linux run: <code>cat id_rsa.pub | xclip</code></li>
  <li>On Windows (via Cygwin/Git Bash) run: <code>cat id_rsa.pub | clip</code></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Add your key to your account via the website.</li>
  <li>Finally setup your .gitconfig.
  
  <ul>
  <li><code>git config --global user.name ""bob""</code></li>
  <li><code>git config --global user.email bob@...</code>
  (don't forget to restart your command line to make sure the config is reloaded)</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Thats it you should be good to clone and checkout.</p>

","<p>This error can happen when you are accessing the SSH URL (Read/Write) instead of Git Read-Only URL but you have no write access to that repo.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just want to clone your own repo, e.g. deploy to a server. In this case you actually only need READ-ONLY access. But since that's <em>your own</em> repo, GitHub may display SSH URL if that's your preference. In this situation, if your remote host's public key is not in your GitHub SSH Keys, your access will be denied, <strong>which is expected to happen</strong>.</p>

<p>An equivalent case is when you try cloning someone else's repo to which you have no write access with SSH URL.</p>

<p>In a word, <strong>if your intent is to clone-only a repo, use HTTPS URL</strong> (<code>https://github.com/{user_name}/{project_name}.git</code>) instead of SSH URL (<code>git@github.com:{user_name}/{project_name}.git</code>), which avoids (unnecessary) public key validation.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: GitHub is displaying HTTPS as the default protocol now and this move can probably reduce possible misuse of SSH URLs.</p>

Is it possible that your system variables have recently changed?  Per <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20226147/where-does-github-for-windows-keep-its-ssh-key"">this</a> SO answer, ssh keys live at <code>%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\.ssh\id_rsa.pub</code>.  So if <code>%HOMEDRIVE%</code> recently changed, git doesn't know where to look for your key, and thus all of the authentication stuff.  </p>

<p>Try running <code>ssh -vT git@github.com</code>.  Take note of where the <code>identity file</code> is located.  For me, that was pointing <em>not</em> to my normal <code>\Users\MyLogin</code> but rather to a network drive, because of a change to environment variables pushed at the network level.</p>

","<p>Guys this is how it worked for me:</p>

<p>1- Open terminal and go to user [See attached image]</p>

<p>2- Open .ssh folder and make sure it doesn't have any file like id_rsa or id_rsa.pub otherwise sometimes it wont properly rewrite files</p>

<p>3 - git --version [Check for git installation and version]</p>

<p>4- git config --global user.email ""your email id""</p>

<p>5- git config --global user.name ""your name""</p>

<p>6- git config --list [make sure you have set your name &amp; email]</p>

<p>7- cd ~/.ssh</p>

<p>8- ssh-keygen, it prompts for saving file, allow it</p>

<p>9- cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  [Access your public key &amp; copy the key to gerrit settings]</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You should not be using the sudo command with Git. If you have a very good reason you must use sudo, then ensure you are using it with every command (it's probably just better to use su to get a shell as root at that point). If you generate SSH keys without sudo and then try to use a command like sudo git push, you won't be using the same keys that you generated</p>

","<p>I was struggling with same problem that's what i did and i was able clone the repo. I followed these procedure for <strong>iMac</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>First Step : Checking if we already have the public SSH key.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Open Terminal.</li>
<li>Enter <code>ls -al ~/.ssh</code> to see if existing SSH keys are present:</li>
</ol>

<p>Check the directory listing to see if you already have a public SSH key.Default public are one of the following d_dsa.pub,id_ecdsa.pub,id_ed25519.pub,id_rsa.pub</p>

<p>If you don't find then go to step 2 otherwise follow step 3</p>

<p><strong>Step 2 : Generating public SSH key</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Open Terminal.</li>
<li>Enter followong command with you valid email address that you use for github <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C ""your_email@example.com""</code></li>
<li>You will see following in terminal <code>Generating public/private rsa key pair</code>. When it prompts to<code>""Enter a file in which to save the key,""</code> press Enter. This accepts the default file location. When it prompts to <code>Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]</code> Just press enter again.
At the prompt, type a secure passphrase.</li>
<li><code>Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]</code> press enter if you don't want to <code>Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]</code> press enter again</li>
</ol>

<p>This will generate <code>id_rsa.pub</code> </p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Interminal type <code>eval ""$(ssh-agent -s)""</code></li>
<li>Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent. If you are using an existing SSH
key rather than generating a new SSH key, you'll need to replace
id_rsa in the command with the name of your existing private key
file. Enter this command <code>$ ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Now copy the SSH key and also add it to you github account </p>

<ol>
<li>In terminal enter this command with your ssh file name <code>pbcopy &lt;
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> This will copy the file to your clipboard
Now open you github account Go to <strong>Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key</strong> Enter title and paste the key from clipboard and save it. Voila you're done. </li>
</ol>

","<p>Let me share my experience too, </p>

<p>I was trying to clone some project from the Gerrit repo where I got my public keys in account settings.</p>

<p>On the first attempt to make <code>git clone</code> I got the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Unable to negotiate with XX.XX.XX.XX port XXX: no matching key exchange
method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
</code></pre>

<p>I figured out that I need to pass the SSH option <code>-oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1</code> somehow to <code>git clone</code>.</p>

<p>Hopefully <code>GIT_SSH_COMMAND</code> environment variable did the job:</p>

<pre><code>export GIT_SSH_COMMAND=""ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1""
</code></pre>

<p>But <code>git clone</code> still didn't start to work.. Now it throws the (on topic):</p>

<pre><code>Permission denied (publickey).
</code></pre>

<p>I got already SSH keys and didn't want to regenerate them. I checked plain SSH connection to the host and it was ok:</p>

<pre><code>****    Welcome to Gerrit Code Review    ****

  Hi XXXXX, you have successfully connected over SSH.

  Unfortunately, interactive shells are disabled.
  To clone a hosted Git repository, use:

  git clone ssh://xxxxx@xx.xx.xx:xxx/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
</code></pre>

<p>I was confused a bit. I started again and turned on the debug for SSH via <code>-vvv</code> option. And I saw the following:</p>

<pre><code>debug1: read_passphrase: can't open /dev/tty: No such device or address
</code></pre>

<p>Possibly, it was an overhead for the <code>GIT_SSH_COMMAND</code> env variable - my key was secured with passphrase (and I entered it when I was checking the login to the git repo host).</p>

<p>So, I decided to get rid of the phasphrase then. A simple command helped me:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -p
</code></pre>

<p>Then I entered my passphrase for the ""old passphrase"" and just hit <kbd>ENTER</kbd> twice on the ""new passphare"" to leave it empty i.e. with no passphrase at all and to confirm my choice.</p>

","<p>Got same error report.</p>

<p>Fixed with using HTTP instead. Since I don't want set ""SSH keys"" for a test PC.</p>

<p>Change URL to HTTP when clone:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
</code></pre>

<p><strong>My problem is a little bit different</strong>: I have URL set when adding a existing local repo to remote, by using:</p>

<pre><code>git remote add origin ssh://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
</code></pre>

<p>To fix it, reset URL to HTTP:</p>

<pre><code>git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
</code></pre>

<p>BTW, you may check your URL using command:</p>

<pre><code>git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)

<p>Then it asks for passphase after the above log.  Why isn't it logging me in without a password?</p>
","<p>setting <strong>ssh authorized_keys</strong> seem to be simple but hides some traps I'm trying to figure</p>

<p>-- SERVER --</p>

<p>in <strong>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</strong> set  <code>passwordAuthentication yes</code> to let server temporary accept password authentication</p>

<p>-- CLIENT -- </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>consider  <a href=""https://www.cygwin.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">cygwin</a> as linux emulation and install &amp; run openssh</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>1.</strong>  generate private and public keys (client side)
<code># ssh-keygen</code></p>

<p>here pressing just ENTER you get <strong><em>DEFAULT</em></strong>
2 files ""<strong>id_rsa</strong>"" and ""<strong>id_rsa.pub</strong>"" in <strong>~/.ssh/</strong> but if you give a <strong>name_for_the_key</strong> the generated files are saved in your <strong>pwd</strong> </p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> place the <strong>your_key.pub</strong> to target machine <code>ssh-copy-id user_name@host_name</code></p>

<p>if  you didn't create default key this is the first step to go wrong 
... you should use</p>

<p><code>ssh-copy-id -i path/to/key_name.pub user_name@host_name</code></p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> logging <code>ssh user_name@host_name</code> will  work only for default id_rsa so here is 2nd trap for you need to <code>ssh -i path/to/key_name user@host</code></p>

<p>(use <strong>ssh -v ...</strong> option to see what is happening)</p>

<p>If <strong>server still asks for password</strong> then  you gave smth.  to <strong>Enter passphrase:</strong> when you've  created keys ( so it's normal)  </p>

<p>if ssh is not listening default port 22 must use <code>ssh -p port_nr</code> </p>

<p>-- SERVER -----</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong>  modify  <strong>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</strong> to have</p>

<pre><code>RSAAuthentication yes
PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile  %h/.ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre>

<p>(uncoment if case)</p>

<p>This tells ssh to accept authorized_keys and look in user home directory for key_name sting written  in .ssh/authorized_keys file</p>

<p><strong>5</strong>  set permissions in target machine</p>

<pre><code>chmod 755 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre>

<p>Also turn off pass auth </p>

<p><code>passwordAuthentication no</code> </p>

<p>to close the gate to all ssh root/admin/....@your_domain  attempts</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> ensure ownership and group ownership of all non-root home directories are appropriate.</p>

<pre><code>chown -R ~ usernamehere
chgrp -R ~/.ssh/ user 
</code></pre>

","<p>It seems like a permission problem. Usually it happens if the permission of some file/directory is not correctly set up. In most case they are <code>~/.ssh</code> and <code>~/.ssh/*</code>. In my case they are <code>/home/xxx</code>.</p>

Since v7.0 OpenSSH <a href=""https://www.gentoo.org/support/news-items/2015-08-13-openssh-weak-keys.html"" rel=""nofollow"">disables</a> DSS/DSA ssh keys by default due to their inherit weakness. So if you have OpenSSH v7.0+, make sure your key is not <code>ssh-dss</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are stuck with DSA keys, you can re-enable support locally by
  updating your <code>sshd_config</code> and <code>~/.ssh/config</code> files with lines like so: <code>PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-dss</code></p>

<p>In my case the problem was that I was generating the ssh-key without using sudo but when using git commands I needed to use sudo.
This comment in the above link ""If you generate SSH keys without sudo, then when you try to use a command like sudo git push, you won't be using the SSH key you generated."" helped me.</p>

<p>So, the solution was that I had to use sudo with both key generating commands and git commands.
Or for others, when they don't need sudo anywhere, do not use it in any of the two steps. (key generating and git commands).</p>

","<p>I faced a similar issue when running SSH or Git Clone in Windows. Following findings helps to solve my problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>When you run “rhc setup” or other ssh methods to generate ssh key, it will create the private key file id_rsa in .ssh folder in your home folder, default is C:\User\UserID</li>
<li>Git for windows has its own .ssh folder in its installation directory. When you run git/ssh, it will look for private key file id_rsa in this folder</li>
<li>Solved the problem by copying id_rsa from the home folder .ssh folder to the .ssh folder in the git installation directory</li>
</ul>

","<p>The process of using SCP to copy files from a local machine to an AWS EC2 Linux instance is covered step-by-step (including the points mentioned below) in <a href=""https://youtu.be/GFTsU_XRXEg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this video</a>.</p>

<p>To correct this particular issue with using SCP:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You need to specify the correct Linux user. From <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Amazon</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>For Amazon Linux, the user name is ec2-user. </li>
<li>For RHEL, the user name is ec2-user or root. </li>
<li>For Ubuntu, the user name is ubuntu or root. </li>
<li>For Centos, the user name is centos. </li>
<li>For Fedora, the user name is ec2-user. </li>
<li>For SUSE, the user name is ec2-user or root. </li>
<li>Otherwise, if ec2-user and root don't work, check with your AMI provider. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Your private key must not be publicly visible. Run the following command so that only the root user can read the file.</p>

<pre><code>chmod 400 /path/to/yourKeyFile.pem
</code></pre></li>

<ol>
<li>Note the spaces between the three parameters given after the <code>-i</code></li>
<li><code>scp</code> stands for secure copy protocol. Knowing the words makes it easier to remember the command.</li>
<li><code>-i</code> dictates that you need to give the <code>.pem</code> file as the next param. If there is no <code>-i</code>, than you do not need a <code>.pem</code>.</li>

<p><strong><code>Permission denied (publickey).</code></strong></p>

<p>From the above you could observe that ssh looks for the keys in the <code>/c/Wrong/Directory/.ssh</code> directory which is not where we have the public keys that we just added to heroku ( using <code>heroku keys:add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> ) ( <strong>Please note that in windows OS <code>~</code> refers to the <code>HOME</code> path which in win 7 / 8 is <code>C:\Users\UserName</code></strong> )</p>

<p>To view your current home directory do : <code>echo $HOME</code> or <code>echo %HOME%</code> ( Windows )</p>

<p>To set your <code>HOME</code> directory correctly ( by correctly I mean the parent directory of <code>.ssh</code> directory, so that ssh could look for keys in the correct directory ) refer these links :</p>

","<p>The above given answer DOES work, but found out I needed to do some extra steps before it worked.</p>

<ol>
<li>I removed all id_rsa* files and generated a new SSH using <a href=""http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git/"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> guide.</li>
<li>Then, I destroyed the heroku app. Removed the ~/.heroku/credentials file.</li>
<li>'heroku create' command (and since the credentials file is removed, it will prompt you for your email/password.</li>
<li>FINALLY type 'heroku keys:add' and it will upload the default ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file.</li>
<li>It works! Well.... YMMV but I really do hope this can be some help as I struggled the whole day trying to figure this out! Haha </li>

","<p>Instead of dealing with SSH keys, you can also try Heroku's new  <a href=""https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-git"" rel=""nofollow"">beta HTTP Git</a> support. It just uses your API token and runs on port 443, so no SSH keys or port 22 to mess with.</p>

<p>To use HTTP Git, first make sure Toolbelt is updated and that your credentials are current:</p>

<pre><code>$ heroku update
$ heroku login
</code></pre>

<p>(this is important because Heroku HTTP Git authenticates in a slightly different way than the rest of Toolbelt)</p>

<p>During the beta, you get HTTP by passing the <code>--http-git</code> flag to the relevant <code>heroku apps:create</code>, <code>heroku git:clone</code> and <code>heroku git:remote</code> commands. To create a new app and have it be configured with a HTTP Git remote, run this:</p>

<pre><code>$ heroku apps:create --http-git
</code></pre>

<p>To change an existing app from SSH to HTTP Git, simply run this command from the app’s directory on your machine:</p>

<pre><code>$ heroku git:remote --http-git
Git remote heroku updated
</code></pre>

<p>Check out the <a href=""https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-git"" rel=""nofollow"">Dev Center documentation for details on how set up HTTP Git for Heroku</a>.</p>

","<p>Windows uses .cer extension for an X.509 certificate. These can be in ""binary"" (ASN.1 DER), or it can be encoded with Base-64 and have a header and footer applied (PEM); Windows will recognize either. To verify the integrity of a certificate, you have to check its signature using the issuer's public key... which is, in turn, another certificate.</p>

<p>Windows uses .pfx for a PKCS #12 file. This file can contain a variety of cryptographic information, including certificates, certificate chains, root authority certificates, and private keys. Its contents can be cryptographically protected (with passwords) to keep private keys private and preserve the integrity of root certificates.</p>

<p>Windows uses .pvk for a private key file. <strike>I'm not sure what standard (if any) Windows follows for these.

","<p>As <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/42864089/3068190"">Roland</a> mentioned in their answer, it's a warning that the <code>ssh-agent</code> doesn't understand the format of the public key and even then, the public key will not be used locally.</p>

<p>However, I can also elaborate and answer why the warning is there. It simply boils down to the fact that the <em>PuTTY Key Generator</em> generates <strong>two different public key formats</strong> depending on what you do in the program.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Throughout my explanation, the key files I will be using/generating will be named <code>id_rsa</code> with their appropriate extensions. Furthermore, for copy-paste convenience, the parent folder of the keys will be assumed to be <code>~/.ssh/</code>. Adjust these details to suit your needs as desired.</p>

<h2>The Formats</h2>

<p><a href=""https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.69/htmldoc/Chapter8.html#puttygen-savepub"" rel=""noreferrer"">Link to the relevant PuTTY documentation</a></p>

<h3>SSH-2</h3>

<p>When you <strong>save</strong> a key using the <em>PuTTY Key Generator</em> using the ""Save public key"" button, it will be saved in the format defined by <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4716#section-3"" rel=""noreferrer"">RFC 4716</a>.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----
Comment: ""github-example-key""
AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEAhl/CNy9wI1GVdiHAJQV0CkHnMEqW7+Si9WYF

tBjh7cOyuU/c4M4D6o2mAVYdLAWMBkSoLG8Oel6TCcfpO/nElw==
---- END SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----
</code></pre>

<h3>OpenSSH</h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, this format doesn't get saved by the generator. However it is generated and shown in the text box titled ""Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file"". To save it as a file, you have to manually copy it from the text box and paste it into a new text file.</p>

<p>For the key shown above, this would be:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEAhl/CNy9wI1GVdiHAJQV0CkHnMEqW7+Si9WYFi2fSBrsGcmqeb5EwgnhmTcPgtM5ptGBjUZR84nxjZ8SPmnLDiDyHDPIsmwLBHxcppY0fhRSGtWL5fT8DGm9EfXaO1QN8c31VU/IkD8niWA6NmHNE1qEqpph3DznVzIm3oMrongEjGw7sDP48ZTZp2saYVAKEEuGC1YYcQ1g20yESzo7aP70ZeHmQqI9nTyEAip3mL20+qHNsHfW8hJAchaUN8CwNQABJaOozYijiIUgdbtSTMRDYPi7fjhgB3bA9tBjh7cOyuU/c4M4D6o2mAVYdLAWMBkSoLG8Oel6TCcfpO/nElw== github-example-key
</code></pre>

<p>The format of the key is simply <code>ssh-rsa &lt;signature&gt; &lt;comment&gt;</code> and can be created by rearranging the SSH-2 formatted file.</p>

<h2>Regenerating Public Keys</h2>

<p>If you are making use of <code>ssh-agent</code>, you will likely also have access to <code>ssh-keygen</code>.</p>

<p>If you have your OpenSSH Private Key (<code>id_rsa</code> file), you can generate the OpenSSH Public Key File using:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -y &gt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
</code></pre>

<p>If you only have the PUTTY Private Key (<code>id_rsa.ppk</code> file), you will need to convert it first.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the <em>PuTTY Key Generator</em></li>
<li>On the menu bar, click ""File"" > ""Load private key""</li>
<li>Select your <code>id_rsa.ppk</code> file</li>
<li>On the menu bar, click ""Conversions"" > ""Export OpenSSH key""</li>
<li>Save the file as <code>id_rsa</code> (without an extension)</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that you have an OpenSSH Private Key, you can use the <code>ssh-keygen</code> tool as above to perform manipulations on the key.</p>

<h2>Bonus: The PKCS#1 PEM-encoded Public Key Format</h2>

<p>To be honest, I don't know what this key is used for as I haven't needed it. But I have it in my notes I've collated over the years and I'll include it here for wholesome goodness. The file will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----

6o2mAVYdLAWMBkSoLG8Oel6TCcfpO/nElwIBJQ==
-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
</code></pre>

<p>This file can be generated using an OpenSSH Private Key (as generated in ""Regenerating Public Keys"" above) using:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -y -e -m pem &gt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pem
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can use an OpenSSH Public Key using:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -e -m pem &gt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pem

<p>In summary, when <code>ssh-add -l</code> returns <code>The agent has no identities</code> it means that keys used by <code>ssh</code> (stored in files such as ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa, etc) are either missing, they are not known to the authentication agent (<code>ssh-agent</code>), or their permissions are set incorrectly (e.g., world writable).</p>

<p>If your keys are missing (i.e., you have not generated any keys), use 'ssh-keygen' (e.g., <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa</code>) to generate them, then use <code>ssh-add</code> to add them.</p>

<p>If keys exist but are not known to <code>ssh-agent</code> (e.g., they may be in a non-standard folder) use 'ssh-add' (e.g., <code>ssh-add /path/to/my-ssh-folder/id_rsa</code>) to add them.</p>

<p>See this <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17846529/could-not-open-a-connection-to-your-authentication-agent"">answer</a> if you are having trouble with <code>ssh-add</code> or <code>ssh-agent</code>.</p>

<p>Can someone help me with this issue?</p>
","<p>I have been stucked a while on the same problem, which I eventually resolved.</p>

<p><strong>My problem</strong>: I could not execute any push. I could check &amp; see my remote (using <code>git remote -v</code>), but when I executed <code>git push origin master</code>, it returned : <code>Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository.</code> and so.</p>

<p><strong>How I solved it :</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>I generated a key</strong> using <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa</code>. Entering a name for the key file (when asked) was useless.</li>
<li>I could then <strong>add the key (to git)</strong>: <code>ssh-add /Users/federico/.ssh/id_rsa</code> , which successfully returned <code>Identity added: /Users/myname/.ssh/id_rsa (/Users/myname/.ssh/id_rsa)</code></li>
<li><strong>I added the SSH key to github</strong> <a href=""https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/"" rel=""noreferrer"">using this help page</a>. </li>
<li>Having tried all the commands in Github's 'Permission denied publickey' help page, only the <code>ssh-add -l</code> command worked / seemed useful (after having ran the previous steps), it successfully returned my key. <a href=""https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey/#verify-the-public-key-is-attached-to-your-account"" rel=""noreferrer"">The last step</a> shows you where to check your public key on your GitHub page. And this command will help you check all your keys : <code>ls -al ~/.ssh</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then the push command eventually worked !</p>

<p>I hope this will help !
Best luck to all.</p>

","<p><strong>THE 2019 ANSWER for macOS Sierra &amp; High Sierra &amp; Catalina:</strong> </p>

<p><em>PS: most of the other answers will have you to create a new ssh key ... but you don't need to do that :)</em> </p>

<p><em>As described in detail on <a href=""https://openradar.appspot.com/27348363"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://openradar.appspot.com/27348363</a>, macOS/OS X till Yosemite used to remember SSH keys added by command <code>ssh-add -K &lt;key&gt;</code></em></p>

<p><strong>So here are the 4 steps i had to take in order for it to work:</strong> </p>

<p><strong>1:</strong> <code>ssh-add ~/.ssh/PATH_TO_YOUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY (e.g. ~/.ssh/id_rsa)</code></p>

<p><strong>2:</strong> Add the following in <code>~/.ssh/config</code></p>

<pre><code>Host * 
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile PATH_TO_YOUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY (e.g. ~/.ssh/id_rsa)

<p><strong>3:</strong> make sure to remove any gitconfig entry that use osxkeychain helper:</p>

I could check &amp; see my remote (using git remote -v), but when I executed git push origin master, it returned : Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository. </p>

<p>I already had an SSH folder and SSH keys, and adding them via Terminal (<code>ssh-add /path/to/my-ssh-folder/id_rsa</code>) successfully added my identity, but I still couldn't push and still got the same error.

My account had 2-factor authentication set up. When this is the case, if Terminal requests credentials, use your username - but NOT your Github password.  For 2-factor authentication, you need to use your authentication code (for me, this was generated by Authy on my phone, and I had to copy it into Terminal for the pw).</p>

","<p>I just thought I'd share that I found the answer to my own question.</p>

<p>Writing out my problem made it even more clear to me, and I further investigated into where I thought my problem lay: the ssh key</p>

<p>Turns out I was right. The issue wasn't with the key itself, but rather that I had not added it to my local Mac's list of known ssh keys. So even though my Heroku account had the correct key uploaded, my Mac could not authenticate with it because it could not find that key on my computer. The solution?</p>

<pre><code>ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
#and, to confirm it's been added to the known list of keys
ssh-add -l
</code></pre>

","<p>I know this has already been answered. But I would like to add my solution as it may helpful for others in the future..</p>

<p>A common key error is: <code>Permission denied (publickey)</code>. You can fix this by using <code>keys:add</code> to notify Heroku of your new key.</p>

<p>In short follow these steps: <a href=""https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/keys"">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/keys</a></p>

<p><strong>First you have to create a key if you don't have one:</strong></p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Second you have to add the key to Heroku:</strong></p>

<pre><code>heroku keys:add

","<p>I had the exact same error (on windows 7) and the cause was different.  I solved it in a different way so I thought I'd add the cause and solution here for others.  </p>

<p>Even though the error seemed to point to heroku really the error was saying <code>""Heroku can't get to the git repository""</code>.  I swore I had the same keys on all the servers because I created it and uploaded it to one after the other at the same time.  </p>

<p>After spending almost a day on this I realized that because git was only showing me the fingerprint and not the actual key. I couldn't verify that it's key matched the one on my HD or heroku.  I looked in the known hosts file and guess what... it shows the keys for each server and I was able to clearly see that the git and heroku public keys did not match.</p>

<p>1) I deleted all the files in my key folder, the key from github using their website, and the key from heroku using git bash and the command <code>heroku keys:clear</code></p>

<p>2) Followed github's instructions <a href=""https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys"">here</a> to generate a new key pair and upload the public key to git</p>

<p>3) using <code>git bash-</code> <code>heroku keys:add</code>
to upload the same key to heroku.  </p>

<p>Now <code>git push heroku master</code> works.</p>

<p>what a nightmare, hope this helped somebody.</p>

","<p>i had the same case on linux ubuntu and just fixed it, it seems that OS was confused between the /root/.ssh/ and home/user/.ssh/ dir, what i did was:</p>

<ol>
<li>removed all keys from root and home/user .shh directory.</li>
<li><a href=""https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys"" rel=""noreferrer"">generated a new key</a> make sure to pay attention to the path of creation (/home/you/.ssh/id_rsa) or (/root/.ssh/id_rsa)</li>
<li>check heroku keys <code>heroku keys</code></li>
<li>if keys in there clear <code>heroku keys:clear</code></li>
<li><code>heroku keys:add</code> now in here if heroku couldn't find a key and asked to generate one right no, and this mean you have the same issue as mine, do the add command like this <code>heroku keys:add /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> the path that you'll add will be the one that you got in step 2.</li>
<li>try <code>git push heroku master</code> now</li>

","<p>I had a similar heroku ssh error that I could not resolve.  </p>

<p>As a workaround, I used the new heroku http-git feature (http transport for ""heroku"" remote instead of ssh).  Details here: <a href=""https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-git"" rel=""nofollow"">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-git</a></p>

<p>(Short version: if you have a project already setup the standard way, run heroku git:remote --http-init to change ""heroku"" remote to http.)</p>

","<p>If you have SSH installed, you should be able to run..</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen
</code></pre>

<p>Then go through the steps, you'll have two files, <code>id_rsa</code> and <code>id_rsa.pub</code> (the first is your private key, the second is your public key - the one you copy to remote machines)</p>

<p>Then, connect to the remote machine you want to login to, to the file <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> add the contents of your that <code>id_rsa.pub</code> file.</p>

<p>Oh, and <code>chmod 600</code> all the <code>id_rsa*</code> files (both locally and remote), so no other users can read them:</p>

<pre><code>chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa*
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, ensure the remote <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file is <code>chmod 600</code> also:</p>

<pre><code>chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre>

<p>Then, when you do <code>ssh remote.machine</code>, it should ask you for the key's password, not the remote machine.</p>

<hr>

<p>To make it nicer to use, you can use <code>ssh-agent</code> to hold the decrypted keys in memory - this means you don't have to type your keypair's password every single time. To launch the agent, you run (including the back-tick quotes, which eval the output of the <code>ssh-agent</code> command)</p>

<pre><code>`ssh-agent`
</code></pre>

<p>On some distros, ssh-agent is started automatically. If you run <code>echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> and it shows a path (probably in /tmp/) it's already setup, so you can skip the previous command.</p>

<p>Then to add your key, you do</p>

<pre><code>ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
</code></pre>

<p>and enter your passphrase. It's stored until you remove it (using the <code>ssh-add -D</code> command, which removes all keys from the agent)</p>

<p>How do you retrieve the public <code>exponent</code> and <code>modulus</code> part from an RSA file?</p>
","<p>It depends on the tools you can use. I doubt there is a JavaScript too that could do it directly within the browser. It also depends if it's a one-off (always the same key) or whether you need to script it.</p>

<h2>Command-line / OpenSSL</h2>

<p>If you want to use something like OpenSSL on a unix command line, you can do something as follows.
I'm assuming you public.key file contains something like this:</p>

<pre><code>-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAmBAjFv+29CaiQqYZIw4P
J0q5Qz2gS7kbGleS3ai8Xbhu5n8PLomldxbRz0RpdCuxqd1yvaicqpDKe/TT09sR

5xVkSp3kxcNcNb/mePSKQIPafQ1sAmBKPwycA/1I5nLzDVuQa95ZWMn0JkphtFIh
HQIDAQAB
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
</code></pre>

<p>Then, the commands would be:</p>

<pre><code>PUBKEY=`grep -v -- ----- public.key | tr -d '\n'`
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can look into the ASN.1 structure:</p>

<pre><code>echo $PUBKEY | base64 -d | openssl asn1parse -inform DER -i
</code></pre>

<p>This should give you something like this:</p>

<pre><code>    0:d=0  hl=4 l= 290 cons: SEQUENCE          
    4:d=1  hl=2 l=  13 cons:  SEQUENCE          
    6:d=2  hl=2 l=   9 prim:   OBJECT            :rsaEncryption
   17:d=2  hl=2 l=   0 prim:   NULL              
   19:d=1  hl=4 l= 271 prim:  BIT STRING 
</code></pre>

<p>The modulus and public exponent are in the last BIT STRING, offset 19, so use <code>-strparse</code>:</p>

<pre><code> echo $PUBKEY | base64 -d | openssl asn1parse -inform DER -i -strparse 19
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you the modulus and the public exponent, in hexadecimal (the two INTEGERs):</p>

<pre><code>    0:d=0  hl=4 l= 266 cons: SEQUENCE          
    4:d=1  hl=4 l= 257 prim:  INTEGER           :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

</code></pre>

<p>That's probably fine if it's always the same key, but this is probably not very convenient to put in a script.</p>

<p>Alternatively (and this might be easier to put into a script),</p>

<pre><code>openssl rsa -pubin -inform PEM -text -noout &lt; public.key

<p>It depends on the input format. If it's an X.509 certificate in a keystore, use <code>(RSAPublicKey)cert.getPublicKey()</code>: this object has two getters for the modulus and the exponent.</p>

<p>If it's in the format as above, you might want to use <a href=""http://www.bouncycastle.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">BouncyCastle</a> and its <code>PEMReader</code> to read it. I haven't tried the following code, but this would look more or less like this:</p>

<pre><code>PEMReader pemReader = new PEMReader(new FileReader(""file.pem""));
Object obj = pemReader.readObject();
pemReader.close();
if (obj instanceof X509Certificate) {
   // Just in case your file contains in fact an X.509 certificate,
   // useless otherwise.
   obj = ((X509Certificate)obj).getPublicKey();
}
if (obj instanceof RSAPublicKey) {
   // ... use the getters to get the BigIntegers.
}

","<p>Copying the desired public key would fall squarely into the <a href=""http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">provisioning</a> phase. The exact answer depends on what provisioning you fancy to use (shell, Chef, Puppet etc). The most trivial would be a <code>file</code> provisioner for the key, something along this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-rb prettyprint-override""><code>config.vm.provision ""file"", source: ""~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"", destination: ""~/.ssh/me.pub""

<p>Well, actually you need to append to authorized_keys. Use the the shell provisioner, like so:</p>

  cat /home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys

<p>Proceed like this to see the path to existing private key (look below for <em>IdentityFile</em>): </p>

<p>run <pre> vagrant ssh-config </pre></p>

<p>result:</p>

<pre>
$ vagrant ssh-config
Host magento2.vagrant150
  HostName 127.0.0.1
  User vagrant

  PasswordAuthentication no
  IdentityFile ""/Users/madismanni/m2/vagrant-magento/.vagrant/machines/magento2.vagrant150/virtualbox/private_key""
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  LogLevel FATAL

<p>Then you can use the private key like this, note also the switch for switching off password authentication</p>

<pre>
ssh -i /Users/madismanni/m2/vagrant-magento/.vagrant/machines/magento2.vagrant150/virtualbox/private_key -o PasswordAuthentication=no vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p 3150

<li>View ""id_rsa.pub"" and copy contents</li>
<li>On openshift create a key from the UI and paste the contents from your ""*.pub"" file</li>

Furthermore I can add every deployment key to only one repository, whereas I would like to be able to deploy multiple repositories on one and the same deployment server.</p>

<p>Is there a way to provide read-only access for private repositories to selected users on Github?</p>
","<p>For Organizations:
I suggest creating a new team specifically for the user. This team can then grant read-only access to the repositories you specify. I hope this helps!</p>

<p>Looking around here I found ""<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/11367152/1350308"">Reading PEM RSA Public Key Only using Bouncy Castle</a>"".
I guess what you want is this:
</p>

<pre><code>using (StreamReader reader = File.OpenText(@""c:\RSA.txt""))
{
    Org.BouncyCastle.OpenSsl.PemReader pr = 
        new Org.BouncyCastle.OpenSsl.PemReader(reader);
    Org.BouncyCastle.Utilities.IO.Pem.PemObject po = pr.ReadPemObject();

    Console.WriteLine(""PemObject, Type: "" + po.Type);
    Console.WriteLine(""PemObject, Length: "" + po.Content.Length);

<p>However, with your file I get an error: <code>System.IO.IOException : base64 data appears to be truncated</code>.</p>

<p>So changing your file to something like:</p>

<p>Just call the 'RSA' method with the text you want to encrypt and you're done.</p>
","<p>You can create an <code>RSACryptoServiceProvider</code> from a PEM file using the following class (<code>GetRSAProviderFromPemFile</code> method).</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong>
<strong>Don't just copy code from StackOverflow without verification! Especially not crypto code! This code has bugs (see comments). You may want to write and run tests before using this in production (if you really have no better option).</strong> I refuse to edit the code to fix it, as it would be just as unreliable as before without tests and an active maintainer.</p>

","<p>I wanted to help explain what's going on here. </p>

<p>An RSA <em>""Public Key""</em> consists of two numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>the modulus (e.g. a 2,048 bit number)</li>
<li>the exponent (usually 65,537)</li>
</ul>

<p>Using your RSA public key as an example, the two numbers are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Modulus</strong>: 297,056,429,939,040,947,991,047,334,197,581,225,628,107,021,573,849,359,042,679,698,093,131,908,015,712,695,688,944,173,317,630,555,849,768,647,118,986,535,684,992,447,654,339,728,777,985,990,170,679,511,111,819,558,063,246,667,855,023,730,127,805,401,069,042,322,764,200,545,883,378,826,983,730,553,730,138,478,384,327,116,513,143,842,816,383,440,639,376,515,039,682,874,046,227,217,032,079,079,790,098,143,158,087,443,017,552,531,393,264,852,461,292,775,129,262,080,851,633,535,934,010,704,122,673,027,067,442,627,059,982,393,297,716,922,243,940,155,855,127,430,302,323,883,824,137,412,883,916,794,359,982,603,439,112,095,116,831,297,809,626,059,569,444,750,808,699,678,211,904,501,083,183,234,323,797,142,810,155,862,553,705,570,600,021,649,944,369,726,123,996,534,870,137,000,784,980,673,984,909,570,977,377,882,585,701</li>
<li><strong>Exponent</strong>: 65,537</li>
</ul>

<p>The question then becomes how do we want to store these numbers in a computer. First we convert both to hexadecimal:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Modulus</strong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li>
<li><strong>Exponent</strong>: 010001</li>
</ul>

    publicExponent    INTEGER   -- e
}

<p>They chose to use the DER flavor of the ASN.1 binary encoding standard to represent the two numbers <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#appendix-A.1.1"" rel=""noreferrer"">[1]</a>:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Five hyphens, and the words <code>BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY</code>. That is your <strong>PEM DER ASN.1 PKCS#1 RSA Public key</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>PEM: synonym for <em>base64</em></li>
<li>DER: a flavor of ASN.1 encoding</li>
<li>ASN.1: the binary encoding scheme used</li>
<li>PKCS#1: The formal specification that dictates representing a public key as structure that consists of modulus followed by an exponent </li>
<li>RSA public key: the public key algorithm being used</li>
</ul>

<h2>Not just RSA</h2>

<p>After that, other forms of public key cryptography came along:</p>

<ul>
<li>Diffie-Hellman</li>
<li>Ellicptic Curve</li>
</ul>

<p>When it came time to create a standard for how to represent the parameters of <strong>those</strong> encryption algorithms, people adopted a lot of the same ideas that RSA originally defined:</p>

<ul>
<li>use ASN.1 binary encoding</li>
<li>base64 it</li>
<li>wrap it with five hyphens</li>
<li>and the words <code>BEGIN PUBLIC KEY</code></li>
</ul>

<p>But rather than using:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----</code></li>
<li><code>-----BEGIN DH PUBLIC KEY-----</code></li>
<li><code>-----BEGIN EC PUBLIC KEY-----</code></li>
</ul>

<p>They decided instead to include the Object Identifier (OID) of what is to follow. In the case of an RSA public key, that is:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>RSA PKCS#1</strong>: <code>1.2.840.113549.1.1.1</code></li>
</ul>

<p>So for RSA public key it was essentially:</p>

<pre><code>public struct RSAPublicKey {
   INTEGER modulus,
   INTEGER publicExponent 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now they created <strong>SubjectPublicKeyInfo</strong> which is basically:</p>

<pre><code>public struct SubjectPublicKeyInfo {
   AlgorithmIdentifier algorithm,
   RSAPublicKey subjectPublicKey
}
</code></pre>

<p>In actual DER ASN.1 definition is:</p>

<pre><code>SubjectPublicKeyInfo  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
    algorithm  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
        algorithm               OBJECT IDENTIFIER, -- 1.2.840.113549.1.1.1 rsaEncryption (PKCS#1 1)
        parameters              ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL  },
    subjectPublicKey     BIT STRING {
        RSAPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
            modulus            INTEGER,    -- n
            publicExponent     INTEGER     -- e
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That gives you an ASN.1 of:</p>

<pre><code>SEQUENCE (2 elements)
   SEQUENCE (2 elements)
      OBJECT IDENTIFIER 1.2.840.113549.1.1.1

<h2>Do it right, or hack it</h2>

<p>Now that you know that the encoding isn't magic, you can write all the pieces needed to parse out the RSA modulus and exponent. Or you can recognize that the first 24 bytes are just added new stuff on top of the original PKCS#1 standard</p>

<pre><code>30 82 01 22          ;SEQUENCE (0x122 bytes = 290 bytes)

|  03 82 01 0F 00    ;BIT STRING  (0x10f = 271 bytes)
|  |  ...
</code></pre>

<p>And due to an extraordinary coincidence of fortune and good luck:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>24 bytes happens to correspond <strong>exactly</strong> to 32 base64 encoded characters</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means if you take your second X.509 public key, and separate the first 32 characters:</p>

<p>...which takes us right back where we started. What have we learned?</p>

<p>Summary: the keys internally are the same, they just look different. An earlier comment pointed out the RSA key format was defined in PKCS#1, and the plain old 'public key' format was defined in PKCS#8. However, editing one form doesn't turn it into the other. Hopefully I've now beaten this distinction to death.</p>

<p>In case there's still a spark of life left, though, let's flog this a bit more and reference the certificate that was originally generated with the RSA private key so long ago, examining its public key and modulus:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;openssl x509 -in newclient_cert.pem -pubkey -noout -modulus

</code></pre>

<p>...and they all lived happily ever after: the certificate has the same modulus value as the RSA public key, RSA private key, and plain old 'public key'. The certificate contains the same plain old 'public key' value that we saw earlier, although it was signed with a file marked as an RSA private key. It's safe to say there's a consensus.</p>

<p>There's no 'RSAPublicKey_out' equivalent keyword in the X509 quadrant of the OpenSSL galaxy, so we can't try that, although the modulus value is described as the ""RSA key modulus"" which I suppose is as close as we'll get. </p>

<p>How this would all look with a DSA-signed certificate, I don't know.</p>

<p>I realize this doesn't answer the original question, but perhaps it provides some useful background. If not, my apologies. At the very least, things not to do and assumptions not to make.</p>

<p>No doubt one has noted the slightly irritating repetition of ""writing RSA key"", when it's not doing any such thing. I assume what's meant is that the rsa module recognizes the plain old public key as a true RSA key, and that's why it keeps harping on ""RSA key"" (plus it is the rsa module, after all). If I recall properly, the generic EVP_PKEY structure has a union for all the key types, with each key type having its own special set of values (the helpfully named g, w, q, and other consonants).</p>

<p>In conclusion, I note there was a complaint regarding programming &amp; development; now, every OpenSSL command obviously has corresponding code, and if one wishes to explore all the wonders that is OpenSSL programming today, the command line would seem a reasonable place to start. In this particular case (as I'm using a recent cygwin at the moment) one might start by reviewing \openssl-1.0.2f\apps\rsa.c and (given one has a high tolerance for macros) \openssl-1.0.2f\crypto\pem\pem_all.c</p>

<p>My understanding was that public keys encrypt, private keys decrypt... can anyone help me understand? </p>
","<p>Your understanding of ""public keys encrypt, private keys decrypt"" is correct...  for data/message ENCRYPTION.  For digital signatures, it is the reverse.  With a digital signature, you are trying to prove that the document signed by you came from you.  To do that, you need to use something that only YOU have:  your private key.</p>

<p>A digital signature in its simplest description is a hash (SHA1, MD5, etc.) of the data (file, message, etc.) that is subsequently encrypted with the signer's private key.  Since that is something only the signer has (or should have) that is where the trust comes from.  EVERYONE has (or should have) access to the signer's public key.   </p>

<p>So, to validate a digital signature, the recipient </p>

<ol>
<li>Calculates a hash of the same data (file, message, etc.),</li>
<li>Decrypts the digital signature using the sender's PUBLIC key, and </li>
<li>Compares the 2 hash values.    </li>
</ol>

<p>If they match, the signature is considered valid.  If they don't match, it either means that a different key was used to sign it, or that the data has been altered (either intentionally or unintentionally).</p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>

"18257185","How does a public key verify a signature?","<p>I am trying to get a better grapple on how public/private keys work. I understand that a sender may add a digital signature to a document using his/her private key to essentially obtain a hash of the document, but what I do not understand is how the public key can be used to verify that signature. </p>

<p>My understanding was that public keys encrypt, private keys decrypt... can anyone help me understand? </p>
","<p>Thought I'd provide a supplemental explanation for anyone looking for something more intuitively revealing.</p>

<p>A big part of this confusion arises from naming 'public keys' and 'private keys' as such because how these things actually work is directly at odds with how a 'key' is understood to be.</p>

<p>Take encryption for example. It could be thought of as working like so:</p>

<ul>
<li>The parties that want to be able to read the secret messages each keep a key
hidden (i.e. a private key)</li>
<li>The parties that want to be able to send secret messages all have the ability to obtain an unlocked locked (i.e. a public lock)</li>
<li>Then sending a secret message is as easy as locking it with an unlocked lock, but unlocking it afterwards can only be done with one of the hidden keys.</li>
</ul>

<p>This allows secret messages to be sent between parties, but from an intuitive standpoint here, 'public lock' is a more suitable name than 'public key'.</p>

<p>However, for sending digital signatures the roles are somewhat reversed:</p>

<ul>
<li>The party that wants to sign messages is the only one with access to the unlocked locks (i.e. a private lock)</li>
<li>The parties that want to verify the signature all have the ability to obtain a key (i.e. a public key)</li>
<li>Then what the signer does is create two identical messages: the one that anyone can read and one to accompany it, but which they lock with one of their private locks.</li>
<li><p>Then when the receiver gets the message, they can read it, and then use the public key to unlock the locked message and compare the two messages. If the messages are the same, then they know that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The unlocked message wasn't tampered with during travel and,</p></li>
<li><p>The message must have been from the person who has the matching lock to their public key.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>And finally, this entire system only works if anyone who wants to validate a signer's signature has an authoritative place to go to to get the matching key to the signer's locks. Otherwise, anyone can say ""Hey, here's the key to so-and-so's private lock"", send you a message pretending to be them but lock it with their private lock, you perform all the above steps and believe the message must actually be from the person you thought, but you're fooled because you were mislead as to the true owner of a public key.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So long as there's a trust-worthy source for retrieving a signer's public key, you'll know who the rightful owner of a public key is, and will be able to validate their signature.</p>

<p>My understanding was that public keys encrypt, private keys decrypt... can anyone help me understand? </p>
","<p>The public key encrypts and only the private key can decrypt it, and the reverse is true. They both encrypt to different hashes but each key can decrypt the other's encryption. </p>

<p>There are a few different ways to verify that a message came from some expected sender. For example:</p>

<p>The sender sends:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The message</p></li>
<li><p>The hash of the message encrypted with their private key</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The receiver:</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Decrypts the signature (2) with the public key to obtain a message, supposedly the same message as (1) but we don't know yet. We now have two messages that we need to verify are identical. So to do this, we will encrypt them both with our public key and compare the two hashes. So we will ....</li>
<li>Encrypt the original message (1) with the public key to obtain a hash</li>
<li>Encrypt the decrypted message (3) to get a second hash and compare to (4) to verify that they are identical. </li>
</ol>

<p>If they aren't identical it means either the message was tampered with or it was signed with some other key and not the one we thought...</p>

<p>Another example would be for the sender to use a common hash that the receiver might know to use as well. For example:</p>

<p>The sender sends:</p>

<ol>
<li>A message </li>
<li>Takes a known hash of the message, then encrypts the hash with the private key</li>
</ol>

<p>The receiver:</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Decrypts (2) and gets a hash value</li>
<li>Hashes the message (1) with the same hash used by the sender</li>
<li>Compares the two hashes to make sure they match</li>
</ol>

<p>This again ensures the message wasn't tampered with and it is from the expected sender. </p>

<p>Step 1 – generates a private key</p>

<p>They keys are different, even in length. Why?</p>
","<p>If it's just the public key string that you want, it's easier to get the <code>publickey.cert</code> file, as it is a plain text file. Assuming that you have the full path of the file (like ""/home/users/iprogrammer/publickey.cert"" or ""D:\MyDocuments\publickey.cert"" )  you do something like:</p>

<pre><code>public String getPublicKeyString( Path path ) throws IOException {
    byte[] fileBytes = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(path));
    return new String( fileBytes, ""US-ASCII"" );
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you the whole file, including the <code>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----</code> and <code>-----END CERTIFICATE-----</code>.</p>

<p>Once you have the whole file, you can use the BouncyCastle library to open it:</p>

<pre><code>    PEMParser pemParser = new PEMParser(new StringReader(certPEMData));
    Object parsedObj = pemParser.readObject();
    System.out.println(""PemParser returned: "" + parsedObj);
    if (parsedObj instanceof X509CertificateHolder)
    {
        X509CertificateHolder x509CertificateHolder = (X509CertificateHolder) parsedObj;
        return x509CertificateHolder.getSubjectPublicKeyInfo().getPublicKeyData().getString();
    }
    else
    {
        throw new RuntimeException(""The parsed object was not an X509CertificateHolder."");
    }

<p>e.g.: if the file is <code>‘public.pem’</code> I just want check inside that it’s a genuine RSA public key file not just a file with texts or file is not corrupted .
I’m already checking that file is not zero sized and md5 . </p>

<p>other possible checks I found 
check file got text <code>‘BEGIN PUBLIC KEY’</code> and <code>‘END PUBLIC KEY’</code>
Also found this command in google , Is there a better way to do this using openssl </p>

","<p>It's possible to use any public key format parser, including <code>openssl</code> or even parse key yourself as the format is not that difficult.</p>

    echo ""this was definitely not a RSA public key in PEM format""

","<p>Be careful with implementing RSA. In fact, you probably shouldn't use RSA at all. (<a href=""https://paragonie.com/blog/2015/09/how-to-safely-implement-cryptography-in-any-application"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Use libsodium instead!</a>)</p>

<p>Even if you're using a library (e.g. PHP's OpenSSL extension directly or, until recently, <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/security/advisory/ZF2015-10"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Zend\Crypt</code></a>), there's still plenty that can go wrong. In particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>PKCS1v1.5 padding, which is the <em>default</em> (and in many cases the only supported padding mode), is vulnerable to a class of chosen-ciphertext attacks called a padding oracle. This was first discovered by Daniel Bleichenbacher. <strong>In 1998.</strong></li>
<li>RSA is not suitable for encrypting large messages, so what implementors often do is take a long message, break it up into fixed-size blocks, and encrypt each block separately. Not only is this slow, it's analogous to <a href=""https://blog.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the dreaded ECB mode</a> for symmetric-key cryptography.</li>
</ul>

<h1>The Best Thing to Do, with Libsodium</h1>

<p>You might want to read <a href=""https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2011/august/javascript-cryptography-considered-harmful/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>JavaScript Cryptography Considered Harmful</em></a> a few times before going down this route. But that said...</p>

<ol>
<li>Use TLSv1.2 with HSTS and HPKP, preferably with ChaCha20-Poly1305 and/or AES-GCM and an ECDSA-P256 certificate (important: when the IETF christens Curve25519 and Ed25519, switch to that instead).</li>
<li>Add <a href=""https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium.js"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">libsodium.js</a> to your project.</li>
<li>Use <code>crypto_box_seal()</code> with a public key to encrypt your messages, client-side.</li>
<li>In PHP, use <a href=""https://paragonie.com/book/pecl-libsodium/read/08-advanced.md#crypto-box-seal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>\Sodium\crypto_box_seal_open()</code></a> with the corresponding secret key for the public key to decrypt the message.</li>
</ol>

<h2>I need to use RSA to solve this problem.</h2>

<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/tqbf/be58d2d39690c3b366ad"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Please don't</a>. Elliptic curve cryptography is faster, simpler, and far easier to implement without side-channels. Most libraries do this for you already. (Libsodium!)</p>

<h2>But I <em>really</em> want to use RSA!</h2>

<p>Fine, follow <a href=""http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-06-11-cryptographic-right-answers.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">these recommendations to the letter</a> and don't come crying to StackOverflow when you make a mistake (like <a href=""http://www.cryptofails.com/post/70059600123/saltstack-rsa-e-d-1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SaltStack did</a>) that renders your cryptography useless.</p>

<li>It avoids the padding oracles by using <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/32050/what-specific-padding-weakness-does-oaep-address-in-rsa"">RSA-OAEP with MGF1+SHA256</a> instead of PKCS1v1.5.</li>
<li>It avoids the ECB mode by clever protocol design:</li>
</ul>

<h3>The EasyRSA Encryption Protocol</h3>

<ol>
<li>EasyRSA generates a random 128-bit key for symmetric key cryptography (via AES).</li>
<li>Your plaintext message is encrypted with <a href=""https://github.com/defuse/php-encryption"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">defuse/php-encryption</a>.</li>
<li>Your AES key is encrypted with RSA, provided by <a href=""https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">phpseclib</a>, using the correct mode (mentioned above).</li>
<li>This information is packed together as a simple string (with a checksum).</li>
</ol>

<p>But, really, if you find a valid use case for public key cryptography, you want libsodium instead.</p>

<h2>Bonus: Encryption with JavaScript, Decryption with PHP</h2>

<p>We're going to use <a href=""https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sodium-plus</a> to accomplish this goal. (Adopted from <a href=""https://dev.to/paragonie/message-encryption-in-javascript-and-php-cg9"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this post</a>.)</p>

<pre><code>const publicKey = X25519PublicKey.from('fb1a219011c1e0d17699900ef22723e8a2b6e3b52ddbc268d763df4b0c002e73', 'hex');

async function sendEncryptedMessage() {
    let key = await getExampleKey();
    let message = $(""#user-input"").val();
    let encrypted = await sodium.crypto_box_seal(message, publicKey);
    $.post(""/send-message"", {""message"": encrypted.toString('hex')}, function (response) {
        console.log(response);
        $(""#output"").append(""&lt;li&gt;&lt;pre&gt;"" + response.message + ""&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;"");
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then the congruent PHP code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);
require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // Composer
header('Content-Type: application/json');
$keypair = sodium_hex2bin(
    '0202040a9fbf98e1e712b0be8f4e46e73e4f72e25edb72e0cdec026b370f4787' .

);

$encrypted = $_POST['message'] ?? null;
if (!$encrypted) {
    echo json_encode(
        ['message' =&gt; null, 'error' =&gt; 'no message provided'],
        JSON_PRETTY_PRINT
    );
    exit(1);
}
$plaintext = sodium_crypto_box_seal_open(sodium_hex2bin($encrypted), $keypair);

echo json_encode(
    ['message' =&gt; $plaintext, 'original' =&gt; $encrypted],
    JSON_PRETTY_PRINT

","<p>Your question should be on server fault. It's a basic trouble or I should say two :</p>

<ul>
<li>on the server side : when you upload your keys on epadmin in your .ssh directory, you have to rename your id_rsa_auto_epmc.pub file in authorized_keys</li>
<li>on the client side : you use a non-default key name for your private key so you have to specify the path to your key by using -i option : ssh -i ~/id_rsa_auto_epmc</li>
</ul>

<p>No changes is needed to default sshd_config file for key authentification. 
For your question, it should be better to put the ssh command line you use.</p>

","<p>If you are using mls-software.com's version of OpenSSH here is another note.</p>

<p>If you install using the SSHD_SERVER account and privilege separation you will be able to use public key authentication (per <a href=""http://www.mls-software.com/opensshd-pki.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mls-software.com/opensshd-pki.html</a>). However if UAC is enable you will not be successful with the install. The user(s) will not be created properly and the service will not be created. Manually trying to get these items up after the fact is very difficult. Simply disabling UAC before installation will allow the installation process to properly create the user(s) and the service. After installation you can re-enable UAC.</p>

<p>When I created the SSHD_SERVER account manually authentication succeed when using password authentication but the client termination the connection with ""/bin/bash: Operation not permitted"". Authentication with public keys was closed by the server (original error posted by Cambolie). </p>

","<p>Following are setup steps for OpenSSH shipped with Windows 10 v.1803 (April 2018 update. See comments to this post, it might not work with 1809).</p>

<p>Server setup (elevated powershell):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install OpenSSH server: <code>Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Start agent and sshd services: <code>Start-Service ssh-agent; Start-Service sshd</code> (this will generate host keys and default configuration automatically in <code>$env:ProgramData\ssh</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>[Optional] Install OpenSSHUtils powershell module: <code>Install-Module -Force OpenSSHUtils</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Client setup (non-elevated powershell):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Generate user key: <code>cd $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh; ssh-keygen.exe</code>, follow prompts, agree to the default suggested file location. This will create 2 files: <code>id_rsa</code> and <code>id_rsa.pub</code>;</p></li>
<li><p>[Optional] add key to authentication agent, so you don't have to enter password each time you use it: <code>ssh-add .\id_rsa</code> (or whatever file was generated);</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Server setup continued (non-elevated powershell):</p>

<ol>
<li>Log in as a user, for which public key auth to be used</li>
<li><code>cd $env:USERPROFILE; mkdir .ssh; cd .ssh; New-Item authorized_keys</code>;</li>
<li>Paste the contents of the <code>id_rsa.pub</code> file from the client to the <code>.ssh\authorized_keys</code> file from the previous step.</li>
<li>Setup permissions properly (important!!!): 

<ol>
<li>Run <code>start .</code> to open explorer with the current folder (<code>$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh</code>);</li>
<li>Right click <code>authorized_keys</code>, go to <code>Properties -&gt; Security -&gt; Advanced</code></li>
<li>Click ""Disable inheritance"";</li>
<li>Choose ""Convert inherited permissions into explicit permissions on this object"" when prompted;</li>
<li>(really, really important) Remove all permissions on file except for the <code>SYSTEM</code> and <em>yourself</em>. There must be <strong>exactly two</strong> permission entries on the file. Some guides suggest running the <code>Repair-AuthorizedKeyPermission $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\authorized_keys</code> - this will try to add the <code>sshd</code> user to the permission list and it <em>will</em> break the authentication, so, don't do that, or at least do not agree on adding the <code>sshd</code> user). Both <code>SYSTEM</code> and yourself should have full control over the file.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If your Windows build is 1809 or later, it is required to comment out the following lines in <code>C:\ProgramData\ssh\sshd_config</code> file. Then restart the <code>sshd</code> service.

<pre><code># Match Group administrators                                                    
#       AuthorizedKeysFile __PROGRAMDATA__/ssh/administrators_authorized_keys  
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Client:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run <code>ssh &lt;serverusername&gt;@&lt;serverhostname&gt;</code>. It should work at this point.</li>
</ol>

<p>Tried that with Windows 10 as server and both itself and a Debian Linux as a client.</p>

","<p>Yes, with BouncyCastle, creating an X509 cert from 2 public keys (the key for the cert and the one for the CA) is done <a href=""https://github.com/pcarrier/identify/blob/master/src/main/java/identify/X509CertificateFactoryImpl.java"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks all.</p>
","<p>You can also generate a certificate using only JDK classes. The disadvantage is that you have to use two classes from the sun.security.x509 package.
The code would be:</p>

<pre><code>KeyStore keyStore = ... // your keystore

// generate the certificate
// first parameter  = Algorithm
// second parameter = signrature algorithm
// third parameter  = the provider to use to generate the keys (may be null or
//                    use the constructor without provider)
CertAndKeyGen certGen = new CertAndKeyGen(""RSA"", ""SHA256WithRSA"", null);
// generate it with 2048 bits
certGen.generate(2048);

// prepare the validity of the certificate
long validSecs = (long) 365 * 24 * 60 * 60; // valid for one year
// add the certificate information, currently only valid for one year.
X509Certificate cert = certGen.getSelfCertificate(
   // enter your details according to your application
   new X500Name(""CN=My Application,O=My Organisation,L=My City,C=DE""), validSecs);

// set the certificate and the key in the keystore
keyStore.setKeyEntry(certAlias, certGen.getPrivateKey(), null, 
                        new X509Certificate[] { cert });
</code></pre>

<p>Retrieve the private key from the key store to encrypt or decrypt data.

","<p>'genrsa' generates just an RSA key.</p>

<p>'req' then uses that key to make a x509 style request.</p>

<p>If you just need a rsa key pair - use genrsa.</p>

<p>If you need a keypair and a signed x509 request you use 'genrsa' and then 'req'.</p>

<p>Optionally 'req' can also generate that key for you (i.e. it encapsulates the 'genrsa' command (and the gendh). </p>

<p>So:</p>

<pre><code> openssl genrsa -aes128 -out privkey.pem 2048
 openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem 
</code></pre>

<p>is almost equivalent to</p>

<pre><code> openssl req -new -x509 -keyout privkey.pem  -newkey rsa:2048
</code></pre>

<p>except that unlike 'genrsa', 'req' does not allow you to specify aes128 as the encryption.</p>

<p>So in a lot of enterprise settings one does it in two steps as to get sufficient control over the key encryption applied.</p>

","<p>It's a public key, so theoretically, the channel you use does not have to be encrypted.</p>

<p>Yet, it has to be a channel that prevents a potential attacker from tampering with the key/message. In the worst case the attacker might replace your public key with his own public key, potentially gaining an access instead of you.</p>

<p>My keys are in the ~/.ssh folder, so whats the issue, and why am i able to commit to the repository if there is a key issue??</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
I did notice something when I went into my .ssh folder. There is a new keypair that was created when I installed Github for Mac... why couldn't it just use my existing keypair i don't know.</p>
","<p>I met with the same problem after installing GitHub for Mac OS X. The application created a new ssh private key in ~/.ssh/github_rsa and added it to the ssh authentication agent.</p>

<p>Check which key the ssh auth agent has cached:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh-add -l
2048 63:0c:a6:51:63:c1:35:76:5d:02:77:97:39:48:0e:4a /Users/jiangxin/.ssh/github_rsa (RSA)
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever you connect to github.com or another ssh services, this key is used first.</p>

<p>Clear the cached keys from ssh-agent using this command:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh-add -D
</code></pre>

<p>Now the ssh client should work normally, using the key defined in ~/.ssh/config or ~/.ssh/id_rsa.</p>

","<p>Normally, you use public key encryption to encrypt a symmetric key, in part because public key encryption is very slow. Typically, you'd send the recipient the following, so that they can decrypt your message:</p>

<ol>
<li>The symmetric key, encrypted with the recipient's public key.</li>
<li>Parameters for the algorithms used, usually an initialization vector for the symmetric cipher.</li>
<li>Identifiers for the encryption algorithms used.</li>
<li>The ciphertext&mdash;the actual message, encrypted under the symmetric cipher.</li>

<p>The standard format for bundling all of this information up is the Cryptographic Message Syntax, or CMS, which is used by S/MIME in email applications.

","<p>RSA keys work on pairs. You can generate ssh private and public keys any number of times..it does not break anything. It simply replaces the old one with a newly generated keys.

","<p>Just in case someone else comes here looking for an answer to the OP's question... and to directly answer that question (namely, how can you re-generate the .pub key in a situation where it is missing, and you only have the private key)... </p>

<p>Here is the answer:</p>

<h2>Regenerating a .pub key from the private key</h2>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa &gt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

<p>The <code>-y</code> option is the command teling <code>ssh-keygen</code> to output your public key.</p>

<p>This will re-generate the .pub part of the pair. Just as the OP pointed out, if you simply generate a new pair, and replace the old private key, you will lose access to whatever servers you have already provided your public key to. Sure, you can go through the process of providing a new public key to those servers, but why go through that hassle if it can be easily avoided?</p>

<p>My Cygwin is set up, and I checked (with <code>netstat -a -b</code> ) that it's running.</p>
","<p>Aside: by ""Cygwin"" I assume you mean sshd or sftpd, because Cygwin itself doesn't do SSH.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you want Jsch client to accept any key from the host, move the <code>.setConfig</code> calls that sets <code>StrictHostKeyChecking no</code> so it is <strong>before</strong> <code>session.connect()</code>. Alternatively you must provide access to a store containing the correct key(s) for your hosts(s) as @Martin explains -- and you should always do that when connecting to anything other than ""localhost"" or possibly a machine certain to be on the same, physically-secure network segment (such as a wired LAN hub within a single room).</p>

<p>My Cygwin is set up, and I checked (with <code>netstat -a -b</code> ) that it's running.</p>
","<p>You are trying to skip a host key checking by setting <code>StrictHostKeyChecking</code> to <code>no</code>.</p>

<p>But you have to do that before the checking, i.e. before the <code>session.connect()</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Anyway, you should never do this, unless you do not care about security. The host key checking is there to protect you from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack"" rel=""noreferrer"">man-in-the-middle attacks</a>.</p>

<p>Instead, set up an expected host key to let JSch verify it.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Call <a href=""https://epaul.github.io/jsch-documentation/javadoc/com/jcraft/jsch/JSch.html#setKnownHosts-java.lang.String-"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>JSch.setKnownHosts</code></a> providing a path to a <code>.ssh/known_hosts</code>-like file.</p>

<p>To generate the <code>.ssh/known_hosts</code>-like file, you can use an <code>ssh-keyscan</code> command from OpenSSH. If you are connecting from a *nix server, you should have the command available, just run</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keyscan example.com &gt; known_hosts
</code></pre>

<p>It will have a format like:</p>

<pre><code>example.com ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEA0hVqZOvZ7yWgie9OHdTORJVI5fJJoH1yEGamAd5G3werH0z7e9ybtq1mGUeRkJtea7bzru0ISR0EZ9HIONoGYrDmI7S+BiwpDBUKjva4mAsvzzvsy6Ogy/apkxm6Kbcml8u4wjxaOw3NKzKqeBvR3pc+nQVA+SJUZq8D2XBRd4EDUFXeLzwqwen9G7gSLGB1hJkSuRtGRfOHbLUuCKNR8RV82i3JvlSnAwb3MwN0m3WGdlJA8J+5YAg4e6JgSKrsCObZK7W1R6iuyuH1zA+dtAHyDyYVHB4FnYZPL0hgz2PSb9c+iDEiFcT/lT4/dQ+kRW6DYn66lS8peS8zCJ9CSQ==
</code></pre>

<p>And reference the generated <code>known_hosts</code> file in your JSch code.</p>

<p>If you are on Windows, you can get a Windows build of <code>ssh-keyscan</code> from <a href=""https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases"" rel=""noreferrer"">Win32-OpenSSH project</a> or Git for Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Call <code>JSch.getHostKeyRepository().add()</code> to provide the expected host key (e.g. hard-coded, as your other credentials).</p>

<p>See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/29604333/850848"">Creating JSch HostKey instance from a public key in .pub format</a>.</p></li>

"11691462","Verifying a signature with a public key","<p>I have an external service which call me back after some defined event, and sign his request with its private key.</p>

<p>I have stored the public key which look like :</p>

<pre><code>-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
........................................
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
</code></pre>

<p>So my work is to check if request's content has not been alterned by verifying signature.</p>

<p>Here is my algorithm :</p>

<pre><code>// 1 - reading public key :
Scanner scanner = new Scanner( new File( keyPath ) );


//            encodedPublicKey.toString( );
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder( );
while ( scanner.hasNextLine( ) )
{
    sb.append( scanner.nextLine( ) );
    sb.append( '\n' );
}

byte[] encodedPublicKey = sb.toString( ).getBytes( ""utf-8"" );

// 2 - loading public key in a relevant object :
X509EncodedKeySpec publicKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec( publicKeyBytes );

KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance( ""DSA"" );

PublicKey publicKey = keyFactory.generatePublic( publicKeySpec );

// 3 - verifying content with signature and content :
Signature sig = Signature.getInstance( ""SHA1withDSA"" );
sig.initVerify( publicKey );
sig.update( message.getBytes( ) );
ret = sig.verify( sign.getBytes( ) );
</code></pre>

<p>But for now my algorithm is stoped at ""PublicKey publicKey = keyFactory.generatePublic( publicKeySpec )"" step by this message :</p>

<pre><code>java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException: Inappropriate key specification: invalid key format
</code></pre>

<p>So how can I load my key in a way that is accepted by java api ?</p>
","<p>Actually I've found the solution.</p>

<p>The problem was to load in the public key file in the right way.</p>

<p>I'va added bouncycastle library to my dependencies :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.bouncycastle&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;bcprov-jdk15on&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.47&lt;/version&gt;

"10332022","RSA decryption with a public key","<p>I've got some decryption problems in my Android project. </p>

<p>I'm getting a string signed with a private key and I have to verify(decrypt) it with a public key. 
I'd like to get exactly the same result as if I were using a PHP function - openssl_public_decrypt ( <a href=""http://php.net/manual/pl/function.openssl-public-decrypt.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://php.net/manual/pl/function.openssl-public-decrypt.php</a> )</p>

<p>I have to do this in my Java project, so I can use Java libs (e.g BouncyCastle, or something else, any recommendations? ) </p>

<p>Any ideas how to solve this?</p>

<p>Ok, here's my code.
I'm getting the public key like this</p>

<pre><code>PEMReader reader = new PEMReader(new InputStreamReader(ctx
                .getAssets().open(""pubkey.pem"")));
        Object obj;
        while ((obj = reader.readObject()) != null) {
             if (obj instanceof RSAPublicKey) {
                pubKey = (RSAPublicKey) obj;
                return pubKey;
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>And I always get the public key without any problems.</p>

<pre><code>Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/NONE/NoPadding"", ""SC"");
c.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, pubKey);
byte[] result = c.doFinal(data_to_decrypt.getBytes());
</code></pre>

<p>And as a result(after converting bytes to string) I get <code>022c06571c6a263b389fcd93159cb311abb880bddf51b7c916dd1ae...</code> </p>

<p>where php functions returns 
<code>sd8dsa348acvcx87|00454|OK|15000|CDE</code> and this is a correct output.</p>
","<p>Java has got the Java Cryptography Extension Framework, which is just designed for these things.</p>

<p>BouncyCastle is a Cryptography Provider for this framework. This means, it provides your Java Cryptography Extension with implementations of cryptography algorithms.</p>

<p>You'll find the basic classes for this in the packages <code>java.security</code> and <code>javax.crypto</code></p>

<p>To decrypt your message with a public key you could try the following:</p>

<pre><code>// Use RSA/NONE/NoPadding as algorithm and BouncyCastle as crypto provider
Cipher asymmetricCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/NONE/NoPadding"", ""BC"");

// asume, that publicKeyBytes contains a byte array representing
// your public key
X509EncodedKeySpec publicKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(publicKeyBytes);

KeyFactory keyFactory;
keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(publicKeySpec.getFormat());
Key key = keyFactory.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);

// initialize your cipher
asymmetricCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key);
// asuming, cipherText is a byte array containing your encrypted message
byte[] plainText = asymmetricCipher.doFinal(cipherText);
</code></pre>

<p>Please note, that this example is <strong>very</strong> basic and lacks several try catch blocks. Also, you should not use an asymmetric cipher without padding as this makes you vulnerable to replay attacks. You may also encounter issues with the key length. In some Java packages, the maximum allowed key length is restricted. This may be solved by using the unlimited strength policy files.</p>

<p>I hope, this helps you in getting started with the Java cryptography.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Problem happens at SecCertificateCreateWithData, it always return nil even through read file is ok.
Anybody has done this please help me, thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT: The cert file was MD5 signature.</p>
","<p>I struggled a lot with the same problem and finally found a solution. My problem was that I needed to use both an external private and public key for encrypting/decrypting data in an iOS app and didn't want to use the keychain.
It turns out you also need a signed certificate for the iOS security library to be able to read the key data and of course the files have to be in the correct format.
The procedure is basically as follows:</p>

<p>Say you have a private key in PEM format (with the -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- and -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----- markers): rsaPrivate.pem </p>

<pre><code>//Create a certificate signing request with the private key
openssl req -new -key rsaPrivate.pem -out rsaCertReq.csr

//Create a self-signed certificate with the private key and signing request
openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in rsaCertReq.csr -signkey rsaPrivate.pem -out rsaCert.crt

//Convert the certificate to DER format: the certificate contains the public key
openssl x509 -outform der -in rsaCert.crt -out rsaCert.der

//Export the private key and certificate to p12 file
openssl pkcs12 -export -out rsaPrivate.p12 -inkey rsaPrivate.pem -in rsaCert.crt
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have two files which are compatible with the iOS security framework: rsaCert.der (public key) and rsaPrivate.p12 (private key). The code below reads in the public key assuming the file is added to your bundle:</p>

<pre><code>- (SecKeyRef)getPublicKeyRef {

    NSString *resourcePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""rsaCert"" ofType:@""der""];
    NSData *certData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:resourcePath];
    SecCertificateRef cert = SecCertificateCreateWithData(NULL, (CFDataRef)certData);
    SecKeyRef key = NULL;
    SecTrustRef trust = NULL;
    SecPolicyRef policy = NULL;

    if (cert != NULL) {
        policy = SecPolicyCreateBasicX509();
        if (policy) {
            if (SecTrustCreateWithCertificates((CFTypeRef)cert, policy, &amp;trust) == noErr) {
                SecTrustResultType result;
                OSStatus res = SecTrustEvaluate(trust, &amp;result);

                //Check the result of the trust evaluation rather than the result of the API invocation.
                if (result == kSecTrustResultProceed || result == kSecTrustResultUnspecified) {
                    key = SecTrustCopyPublicKey(trust);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    if (policy) CFRelease(policy);
    if (trust) CFRelease(trust);
    if (cert) CFRelease(cert);
    return key;
}
</code></pre>

<p>To read in the private key use the following code:</p>

<pre><code>SecKeyRef getPrivateKeyRef() {
    NSString *resourcePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""rsaPrivate"" ofType:@""p12""];
    NSData *p12Data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:resourcePath];

    NSMutableDictionary * options = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];

    SecKeyRef privateKeyRef = NULL;

    //change to the actual password you used here
    [options setObject:@""password_for_the_key"" forKey:(id)kSecImportExportPassphrase];

    CFArrayRef items = CFArrayCreate(NULL, 0, 0, NULL);

    OSStatus securityError = SecPKCS12Import((CFDataRef) p12Data,
                                             (CFDictionaryRef)options, &amp;items);

    if (securityError == noErr &amp;&amp; CFArrayGetCount(items) &gt; 0) {
        CFDictionaryRef identityDict = CFArrayGetValueAtIndex(items, 0);
        SecIdentityRef identityApp =
        (SecIdentityRef)CFDictionaryGetValue(identityDict,
                                             kSecImportItemIdentity);

        securityError = SecIdentityCopyPrivateKey(identityApp, &amp;privateKeyRef);
        if (securityError != noErr) {
            privateKeyRef = NULL;
        }
    }
    [options release];
    CFRelease(items);
    return privateKeyRef;

<p>Problem happens at SecCertificateCreateWithData, it always return nil even through read file is ok.
Anybody has done this please help me, thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT: The cert file was MD5 signature.</p>
","

<p>Starting with iOS 10, it is actually possible to import PEM private keys w/o converting them to <em>PKCS#12</em> (which is a very universal container format for everything related to cryptography) and thus also w/o using OpenSSL on command line or statically linking apps with it. On macOS it's even possible since 10.7 using a different function than the ones mentioned here (but so far it doesn't exist for iOS). Exactly the way described below will also work on macOS 10.12 and later, though.</p>

<p>To import a certificate, it's enough to just strip the </p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>-----END CERTIFICATE-----
</code></pre>

<p>lines, then run base64 decoding over the data left, the result is a certificate in standard DER format, which can just be fed to <code>SecCertificateCreateWithData()</code> to get a <code>SecCertificateRef</code>. This has always been working, also prior to iOS 10.</p>

<p>To import a private key, a little bit of extra work may be required. If the private key is wrapped with </p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
</code></pre>

<p>then it is very easy. Again, the first and last line needs to be stripped, the remaining data needs to be base64 decoded and the result is a RSA key in <em>PKCS#1</em> format. This format can only hold RSA keys and it is directly readable, just feed the decoded data into <code>SecKeyCreateWithData()</code> to obtain a <code>SecKeyRef</code>. The <code>attributes</code> dictionary just need the following key/value pairs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kSecAttrKeyType</code>: <code>kSecAttrKeyTypeRSA</code></li>
<li><code>kSecAttrKeyClass</code>: <code>kSecAttrKeyClassPrivate</code> </li>
<li><code>kSecAttrKeySizeInBits</code>: <code>CFNumberRef</code> with then number of bits in the key (e.g. 1024, 2048, etc.) If not known, this information can actually be read from the raw key data, which is ASN.1 data (it's a bit beyond the scope of this answer, but I will provide some helpful links below about how to parse that format). <em>This value is maybe optional! In my tests it was actually not necessary to set this value; if absent, the API determined the value on its own and it was always set correctly later on.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In case the private key is wrapped by <code>-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----</code>, then the base64 encoded data is not in <em>PKCS#1</em> format but in <em>PKCS#8</em> format, however, this is a just a more generic container that can also hold non-RSA keys but for RSA keys the inner data of that container is equal to <em>PKCS#1</em>, so one could say for RSA keys <em>PKCS#8</em> is <em>PKCS#1</em> with an extra header and all you need to do is stripping that extra header. Just strip the first 26 bytes of the base64 decoded data and you have <em>PKCS#1</em> again. Yes, it's really that simple.</p>

<p>To learn more about PKCS#x formats in PEM encodings, <a href=""https://tls.mbed.org/kb/cryptography/asn1-key-structures-in-der-and-pem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">have a look at this site</a>. To learn more about ASN.1 format, <a href=""https://www.obj-sys.com/asn1tutorial/node4.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's a good site for that</a>. And if you need a simple, yet powerful and interactive online ASN.1 parser to play around with different formats, one that can directly read PEM data, as well as ASN.1 in base64 and hexdump, <a href=""https://lapo.it/asn1js"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">try this site</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Very important:</strong> When adding a private key to keychain, that you created as above, please be aware that such a private key doesn't contain a public key hash, yet a public key hash is important for they keychain API to form an identity (<code>SecIdentityRef</code>), as using the public key hash is how the API finds the correct private key that belongs to an imported certificate (a <code>SecIdentityRef</code> is just a <code>SecKeyRef</code> of a private key and a <code>SecCertificateRef</code> of a cert forming a combined object and it's the public key hash, that binds them together). So when you plan to add the private key to keychain, be sure to set a public key hash manually, otherwise you won't ever be able to get an identity for it and without that you cannot use keychain API for tasks like signing or decrypting data. The public key hash must be stored in an attribute named <code>kSecAttrApplicationLabel</code> (stupid name, I know, but it's really not a label and nothing the user can ever see, check out the documentation). E.g.:</p>

<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>OSStatus error = SecItemAdd(
    (__bridge CFDictionaryRef)@{
        (__bridge NSString *)kSecClass: 
            (__bridge NSString *)kSecClassKey,
        (__bridge NSString *)kSecAttrApplicationLabel: 
             hashOfPublicKey, // hashOfPublicKey is NSData *
#if TARGET_OS_IPHONE
        (__bridge NSString *)kSecValueRef: 
            (__bridge id)privateKeyToAdd, // privateKeyToAdd is SecKeyRef
#else
        (__bridge NSString *)kSecUseItemList: 
              @[(__bridge id)privateKeyToAdd], // privateKeyToAdd is SecKeyRef
              // @[ ... ] wraps it into a NSArray object,
              // as kSecUseItemList expects an array of items
#endif
     },
     &amp;outReference // Can also be NULL,
                   // otherwise reference to added keychain entry
                   // that must be released with CFRelease()

<p>or anything that doesn't put the key in base64 plaintext in a single string. Probably also something that doesn't store the key in base64 would be a good idea too, since raw base64 text fragments are pretty easy to spot.</p>

<p>It's not a particularly GOOD way to protect the key. But it protects against a trivial attack where somebody just searches through literal strings in you APK looking for something that looks like a base64-encoded public key. At least you make the #$<em>#</em>$ers work a little bit.</p>

<p>Presumably evil people can do bad things if they identify your public key. Google seems to think so, apparently. I can guess what this step does, but I'm not sure I really want to speculate on that in an open forum, and give anyone any ideas.  You want to do it though.</p>

<p>The basic plot summary would be that you're making it more difficult for somebody to write an application that programmatically de-LVLs an applciation.</p>

<p>One assumes that anyone who's doing this makes a living cracking 20 or 30,000 android apps and republishing them. Chances are, I suppose that they're not going to take the extra ten minutes to add your app to the list of 20,000 Android apps that have already been broken by a program, if they actually have to do a little bit of manual work. Unless you have a top tier application. And then the battle is potentially endless, and probably ultimately futile.</p>

<p>Splitting the key into consecutive chunks (as proposed in another answer) probably isn't good enough. Because the key will end up in consecutive strings in the string constant tables in the APK. Too easy to find that with a program.</p>

<p>How can we create the same key programmatically using any bit manipulation process? Has someone done it before? Is there any sample code on how to do this?</p>
","<p>An alternative is to do some basic transforms on the key.</p>

<pre><code>// Replace this with your encoded key.
String base64EncodedPublicKey = """";

// Get byte sequence to play with.
byte[] bytes = base64EncodedPublicKey.getBytes();

// Swap upper and lower case letters.
for (int i = 0; i &lt; bytes.length; i++) {
    if(bytes[i] &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; bytes[i] &lt;= 'Z')
        bytes[i] = (byte)( 'a' + (bytes[i] - 'A'));
    else if(bytes[i] &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; bytes[i] &lt;= 'z')
        bytes[i] = (byte)( 'A' + (bytes[i] - 'a'));
}

// Assign back to string.
base64EncodedPublicKey = new String( bytes );
</code></pre>

<p>So the idea would be to put your original key in as <code>base64EncodedPublicKey</code> and run the above code, it would swap lower and uppercase letters and put the result back in <code>base64EncodedPublicKey</code>. You can then copy the result from the debugger and paste it into code as the original <code>base64EncodedPublicKey</code> value. At this point your key will be transformed (upper and lower case switched) and at runtime it'll fix it back to the correct casing, and continue to work.</p>

<p>The above is obviously quite a basic transcode, but you can be more creative, reverse the ordering of A-Z, swap odd and even numbers, swap vowels for even numbers. The issue here is that if I put code in the above snippet that does a bunch of more interesting transcodes, and then everyone copy and pastes that into their projects, a cracker will easily be able to see and use the transcode themselves (from looking at this post)! So you just have to come up with a few transforms yourself.</p>

<p>I've purposely made the above work in both direction (so if you run it twice, you'll get your original value back) as it makes it easy to run the algorithm on your original key. I think it is kind of neat it looks like the real key is sitting there as plain text, a casual cracker may try to switch this and then be confused when it doesn't work.</p>

","<p>The key of asymmetric cryptography is to have an asymmetric function which allow decrypting message encrypted by the asymmetric key, without allowing to find the other key. In RSA, the function used is based on factorization of prime numbers however it is not the only option (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography"">Elliptic curve</a> is another one for example).</p>

<p>So, basically you need two prime numbers for generating a RSA key pair. If you are able to factorize the public key and find these prime numbers, you will then be able to find the private key. <strong>The whole security of RSA is based on the fact that it is not easy to factorize large composite numbers</strong>, that's why the length of the key highly change the robustness of the RSA algorithm.</p>

<p>There are competitions to factorize large prime numbers with calculators each years with nice price. The last step of factorizing RSA key was done <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_Factoring_Challenge"">in <strong>2009 by factorizing 768 bits</a> keys</strong>. That's why at least 2048 bit keys should be used now.</p>

<p>As usual, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28algorithm%29"">Wikipedia</a> is a good reference on RSA.</p>

","<p>RSA uses the idea of one-way math functions, so that it's easy to encrypt and decrypt if you have the key, but hard (as in it takes lots and lots of CPU cycles) to decrypt if you don't have the key. Even before they thought of using prime numbers, mathematicians identified the need for a one-way function.</p>

<p>The first method they hit upon was the idea that if your ""key"" is a prime number, and your message is another number, then you can encrypt by multiplying the two together. Someone with the key can easily divide out the prime number and get the message, but for someone without the prime number, figuring out the prime number key is hard.</p>

","<p>All public key algorithms are based on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapdoor_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">trapdoor functions</a>, that is, mathematical constructs that are ""easy"" to compute in one way, but ""hard"" to reverse unless you have also some additional information (used as private key) at which point also the reverse becomes ""easy"".</p>

<p>""Easy"" and ""hard"" are just qualitative adjectives that are always more formally defined in terms of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">computational complexity</a>. ""Hard"" very often refers to computations that cannot be solved in polynomial time <strong>O(n<sup>x</sup>)</strong> for some fixed <strong>x</strong> and where <strong>n</strong> is the input data.</p>

<p>In the case of RSA, the ""easy"" function is the modular exponentiation <em>C = M<sup>e</sup> mod N</em> where the factors of <em>N</em> are kept secret. The ""hard"" problem is to find the <em>e</em>-th root of C (that is, <em>M</em>). Of course, ""hard"" does not mean that it is <em>always</em> hard, but (intuitively) that increasing the size of <em>N</em> by a certain factor increases the complexity by a much larger factor.</p>

<p>The sizes of the modulus which are recommended (2048 bits, or 617 decimal digits) relate to the availability of computation power at present time, so that if you stick to them you are assured that it will be extremely expensive for the attacker to break it. For more details, I should refer you to <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1978/how-big-an-rsa-key-is-considered-secure-today/1982#1982"">a brilliant answer on cryptography.SE</a> (go and upvote :-)).</p>

<p>Finally, in order to have a trapdoor, <em>N</em> is built so as to be a composite number. It theory, for improved performance, N may have more than 2 factors, but the general security rule is that all factors must be balanced and have roughly the same size. That means that if you have <em>K</em> factors, and <em>N</em> is <em>B</em> bits long, each factor is roughly <em>B/K</em> bits longs.</p>

<p>This problem to solve is not the same as the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">integer factorization problem</a> though. The two are related in that if you manage to factor <em>N</em> you can compute the private key by re-doing what the party that generated the key did. Typically, the exponent <em>e</em> being used is very small (3); it cannot be excluded that someday <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/16/Drevil_million_dollars.jpg/200px-Drevil_million_dollars.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">somebody</a> devises an algorithm to compute the <em>e</em>-th without factoring <em>N</em>.</p>

<p>EDIT: Corrected the number of decimal digits for the modulus of a 2048 bits RSA key.</p>

<li>Generated the RSA key and added it to the authorized_keys file.</li>
<li>net start sshd</li>
<li>ssh localhost</li>

<p>There are a couple of issues as well:
 - The group is displayed as mkgroup.
 - The user ""xxxxxxxx"" does not exist in the localhost, I guess. 
   It was not displayed in ""net user sshd"". ""xxxxxxxx"" is a Domain account. 
   Could this be causing the public key authentication issue?</p>

<p>Just to see if there is any difference in the output, I deleted the authorized_keys file and tried. There was no difference in the output. It still sends a packet and proceeds to the next mode of authentication. There is no error message. Is there any other way to get more details (I'm a Cygwin and SSH n00b)?

","<p>It appears that there are some problems with your cygwin setup, which is why the user/group is not showing up correctly.  You need to run mkgroup to generate your /etc/group, and possibly mkpasswd as well.   I had a similar problem - I had to run mkpasswd to regenerate my /etc/passwd.  After running mkpasswd, I could finally ssh into my localhost.  It's a shame the debug info does not log enough info to easily diagnose the problem.</p>

","<p>Quick double-check, did you add your public key or private key to authorized_keys? It needs to be your public key.</p>

<p>I notice that the server is not responding with a ""Server accepts key..."" upon receipt of your pubkey_test and I have seen that when the public key is missing from the authorized_keys file on the server you're connecting to.  You should see:</p>

<pre><code>debug3: send_pubkey_test
debug2: we sent a publickey packet, wait for reply
debug1: Server accepts key: pkalg ssh-rsa blen 279
</code></pre>

<p>Easiest way to set it up is to use ssh-copy-id to do the work, e.g.,:</p>

<pre><code># ssh-copy-id localhost
</code></pre>

<p>That will create your authorized_keys file with the correct permissions.  When you run this, you will be prompted for your password, because the server doesn't have the key.  Once this command runs successfully, you'll be able to simply ssh to the server using your identity file.  Note that ssh_config defaults the identity file to ~/.ssh/identity, ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa, so if you want to use a different file, you should set up an alias in ~/.ssh/config.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

","<p>I had a similar problem setting up public key authentication (with similar verbose output from the client), though I was trying to do it from an Ubuntu client to a Cygwin SSHD server, and it was a very old Cygwin environment (version 1.5.12 on Windows 2000!).   I had copied the public key using ssh-copy-id.</p>

<p>In my case, making the authorized_keys files world readable (mode 644) on the Cygwin side appeared to allow public key authentication to succeed.   </p>

<p>From what I've seen, mode 600 is standard, so perhaps this ""fix"" in my case is actually a sign of a problem elsewhere in the Cygwin SSHD setup. But now that pub key authentication is finally working, I probably won't be digging any deeper.</p>

","<p>My problem was that I thought cygwin is OK if its files gets copy and pasted, so if I wanted to clone the installation I just copied and pasted <code>C:\cygiwn64</code> folder somewhere else and ran the <code>.bat</code> file.  </p>

<p>But I was wrong. Every time you copy a file with windows explorer the permission and ownerships gets corrupted in cygwin. So <strong>dont use windows explorer for making changes to any of the cygwin files</strong>, only use the command line apps like <code>cp</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>vim</code>, <code>nano</code> and others.  </p>

<p>Also If you want to create a new installation just use the <code>setup_x86_64.exe</code> file and simply choose a new <code>root</code> directory for it and let the setup install packages and do the rest for you.</p>

<p>This way you make sure that nothing gets corrupted and you wont get surprised by some amazing error messages in the future.</p>

<pre><code>de = 1 mod phi(m)

<p>For RSA encryption, <code>e</code> is the encryption key, <code>d</code> is the decryption key,  and encryption
and decryption are both performed by exponentiation mod <code>m</code>.  If you encrypt a message <code>a</code>

since <code>de = 1 mod phi(m)</code>, <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulersTotientTheorem.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Euler's totient theorem</a> tells us that a<sup>de</sup> is congruent 
to a<sup>1</sup> mod m -- in other words, you get back the original <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>There are no known efficient ways to obtain the decryption key <code>d</code> knowing only the
encryption key <code>e</code> and the modulus <code>m</code>, without knowing the factorization <code>m = pq</code>, so

","<p>To extend <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/17300024/474189"">Uwe's answer</a>, the reason you see different values is your strange handling of the public key data:</p>

<pre><code>RSAPublicKey pubkey = (RSAPublicKey) cert.getPublicKey();
tempPub = pubkey.getEncoded();
sPub = new String( tempPub );
field=hex(sPub);
System.out.println(""Public key : \n"" + field );
</code></pre>

<p>Here you are creating a string from a stream of bytes (never a good idea) and then hex-encoding the result. No wonder it looks weird! In fact, your <code>hex</code> method looks very strange and probably should be thrown away.</p>

<p>Instead, just try this:</p>

<pre><code>RSAPublicKey pubkey = (RSAPublicKey) cert.getPublicKey();
field = DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(pubkey.getEncoded());
System.out.println(""Public key : \n"" + field );
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using Java 5 or below, Google for a decent byte-to-hex function as <code>DatatypeConverter</code> is not available.</p>

","<p>You cannot generate either key directly from the other. It is mathematically impossible. If you had a key blob that contained <em>both</em> the public and private keys, you could extract either one of them with relative ease.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT, 2017:</strong> Many years and a much better understanding of crypto later, and it's now clear to me that this answer isn't really correct.</p>

<p>To quote Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The public key consists of the modulus n and the public (or encryption) exponent e. The private key consists of the modulus n and the private (or decryption) exponent d, which must be kept secret. p, q, and λ(n) must also be kept secret because they can be used to calculate d.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The public modulus n can be computed as p &times; q. The only thing missing from a raw private key is e, but this value is usually selected as 65537, and if not you can still compute e from d and λ(n).</p>

<p>However, many private key storage formats actually contain the public modulus n alongside the other components, so you can just do a direct extraction of the values.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT, 2018:</strong> Still getting downvotes for this, and rightly so! I'm leaving this answer up so people can see why I was originally wrong, and to remind myself not to be wrong in future.</p>

","<p>The assumption is that we are talking about RSA private and Public keys. Then, if you are working from a PEM format file, then first you need to read the private key from the file into a PrivateKey object:</p>

<pre><code>    public PrivateKey readPemRsaPrivateKey(String pemFilename) throws
            java.io.IOException,
            java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException,
            java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException
    {
            String pemString = File2String(pemFilename);

            pemString = pemString.replace(""-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"", """");
            pemString = pemString.replace(""-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"", """");

            byte[] decoded = Base64.decodeBase64(pemString);

            PKCS8EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(decoded);
            KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");

            return kf.generatePrivate(keySpec);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>where File2String is something like:</p>

<pre><code>    private static String File2String(String fileName) throws
            java.io.FileNotFoundException, java.io.IOException
    {
            File file = new File(fileName);

            char[] buffer = null;

            BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));

            buffer = new char[(int)file.length()];

            int i = 0;
            int c = bufferedReader.read();

            while (c != -1) {
                    buffer[i++] = (char)c;
                    c = bufferedReader.read();
            }
            return new String(buffer);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can generate the corresponding PublicKey with code like this:</p>

<pre><code>    import java.security.interfaces.RSAPrivateCrtKey;
    import java.security.spec.RSAPublicKeySpec;
</code></pre>

<p>...</p>

<pre><code>    PrivateKey myPrivateKey = readPemRsaPrivateKey(myPrivateKeyPemFileName);
    RSAPrivateCrtKey privk = (RSAPrivateCrtKey)myPrivateKey;

    RSAPublicKeySpec publicKeySpec = new java.security.spec.RSAPublicKeySpec(privk.getModulus(), privk.getPublicExponent());

    KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
    PublicKey myPublicKey = keyFactory.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);

The <code>chmod</code> on the parent directories of your config file might be different between your two computers.<br>
(and I am not talking about just the immediate parent directory <code>.ssh</code>, but also <em>all</em> the parent directories)</p>

<p>See ""<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13425811/git-ssh-authentication/13428529#13428529"">Git SSH authentication</a>"", but also know that if any of the parent directories is writable for group or world, ssh won't work.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note also that your second command is not right, and should be:</p>

<pre><code>git clone ubuntu@ec2xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com/var/www/project.git
</code></pre>

<p><strong>no '<code>:</code>'</strong> (a '<code>:</code>' means using a <code>config</code> file, with an <code>scp</code>-like syntax)</p>

<p>it can only work if you have <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code> and <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> though.<br>
If you have mykey.pem, then you <em>need</em> a <code>config</code> file for ssh to know where are your public and private keys, which means only this can work:</p>

","<p>Recently I had to re-install the system which held the working configuration and I have not managed to replicate it, so it's not about the linux version (very likely). What I managed to do, is that I managed to use the mentioned original script to clone the repository into my home directory. Here it picked up the name correctly, but if I navigated into /var/www, what I was doing before, it just gave me the same error: could ec2server not found ... . So I figure the problem has to do something with the permissions + commands combination. If anyone can figure it out how to make it work, I will mark he's response as a correct answer, until then I am marking mine as the correct one, since this is the closest to the correct.</p>

<p>UPDATE </p>

<p>I figured it out what was the problem: I had to change the permission on /var/www folder in order to be able to clone into that directory. Now it's 777 ( used only for dev on a local machine).</p>

"2012645","Can you help me get my head around openssl public key encryption with rsa.h in c++?","<p>I am trying to get my head around public key encryption using the openssl implementation of rsa in C++. Can you help? So far these are my thoughts (please do correct if necessary)</p>

<ol>
<li>Alice is connected to Bob over a network</li>
<li>Alice and Bob want secure communications</li>
<li>Alice generates a public / private key pair and sends public key to Bob</li>
<li>Bob receives public key and encrypts a randomly generated symmetric cypher key (e.g. blowfish) with the public key and sends the result to Alice</li>
<li>Alice decrypts the ciphertext with the originally generated private key and obtains the symmetric blowfish key</li>
<li>Alice and Bob now both have knowledge of symmetric blowfish key and can establish a secure communication channel </li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I have looked at the openssl/rsa.h rsa implementation (since I already have practical experience with openssl/blowfish.h), and I see these two functions:</p>

<pre><code>int RSA_public_encrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa, int padding);
int RSA_private_decrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
 unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa, int padding);
</code></pre>

<p>If Alice is to generate *rsa, how does this yield the rsa key pair? Is there something like rsa_public and rsa_private which are derived from rsa? Does *rsa contain both public and private key and the above function automatically strips out the necessary key depending on whether it requires the public or private part? Should two unique *rsa pointers be generated so that actually, we have the following:</p>

<pre><code>int RSA_public_encrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa_public, int padding);
int RSA_private_decrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
 unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa_private, int padding);
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly, in what format should the *rsa public key be sent to Bob? Must it be reinterpreted in to a character array and then sent the standard way? I've heard something about certificates -- are they anything to do with it?</p>

<p>Sorry for all the questions,
Best Wishes,
Ben.</p>

","<p>Actually, no problem, I have just read that basically, the RSA object is a structure that contains both public and private fields. One can extract the public field data and only send that to Bob.</p>

<p>I.e. basically, to extract the public fields from rsa and store each in two different buffers (which are char arrays and can then be sent to Bob), you do:</p>

<pre><code>sprintf(keyBufferA,""%s\r\n"",BN_bn2hex(rsa-&gt;n));
sprintf(keyBufferB,""%s\r\n"",BN_bn2hex(rsa-&gt;e));

BN_hex2bn(&amp;rsa-&gt;n, keybufA);
BN_hex2bn(&amp;rsa-&gt;e, keybufB);

</code></pre>
","<p>You should actually be using the higher-level ""Envelope Encryption"" functions from <code>openssl/evp.h</code>, rather than the low-level RSA functions directly.  These do most of the work for you and mean you don't have to reinvent the wheel.</p>

<p>In this case, you'd use the <code>EVP_SealInit()</code>, <code>EVP_SealUpdate()</code> and <code>EVP_SealFinal()</code> functions.  The corresponding decryption functions are <code>EVP_OpenInit()</code>, <code>EVP_OpenUpdate()</code> and <code>EVP_OpenFinal()</code>.  I would suggest using <code>EVP_aes_128_cbc()</code> as the value of the cipher type parameter.</p>

<p>Once you've got the public key loaded into an <code>RSA *</code> handle, you use <code>EVP_PKEY_assign_RSA()</code> to put it into an <code>EVP_PKEY *</code> handle for the EVP functions.</p>

<p>Once you've got this going, to solve the authentication problem I mentioned in my comment, you'll need to established a trusted authority (""Trent"").  Trent's public key is known to all users (distributed with the application or similar - just load it from a PEM file).  Instead of exchanging bare RSA parameters, Alice and Bob exchange x509 certificates that contain their RSA public keys together with their name, and are signed by Trent.  Alice and Bob then each verify the certificate they recieved from the other (using Trent's public key, which they already know), including checking that the associated name is the right one, before continuing the protocol.  OpenSSL includes functions for loading and verifying certificates in the <code>x509.h</code> header.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's an example of how to use <code>EVP_Seal*()</code> to encrypt a file given the recipient's public key.  It takes the PEM RSA Public Key file (ie as generated by <code>openssl rsa -pubout</code>) as a command line argument, reads the source data from stdin and writes the encrypted data to stdout.  To decrypt, use <code>EVP_Open*()</code> instead, and <code>PEM_read_RSAPrivateKey()</code> to read a private key rather than public key.</p>

<p>It's not really that hard - and certainly less error prone than messing about generating padding, IVs and so on yourself (the Seal function does both the RSA and AES parts of the deal).  Anyway, the code:</p>

<hr>

<p>The code you've posted illustrates nicely why you should use the higher-level functions - you've fallen into a couple of pitfalls:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>rand()</code> is emphatically <strong>not</strong> a cryptographically strong random number generator! Generating your symmetric key using <code>rand()</code> is enough to make the entire system completely insecure. (The <code>EVP_*()</code> functions generate the necessary random numbers themselves, using a cryptographically strong RNG, seeded from an appropriate entropy source).</p></li>
<li><p>You are setting the IV for CFB mode to a fixed value (zero).  This negates any advantage of using CFB mode in the first place (allowing attackers to trivially perform block-replacement attacks and worse).  (The <code>EVP_*()</code> functions generate an appropriate IV for you, when required).</p></li>
<li><p><code>RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING</code> should be used if you're defining a new protocol, rather than interoperating with an existing protocol.</p></li>

<ol>
<li>Alice is connected to Bob over a network</li>
<li>Alice and Bob want secure communications</li>
<li>Alice generates a public / private key pair and sends public key to Bob</li>
<li>Bob receives public key and encrypts a randomly generated symmetric cypher key (e.g. blowfish) with the public key and sends the result to Alice</li>
<li>Alice decrypts the ciphertext with the originally generated private key and obtains the symmetric blowfish key</li>
<li>Alice and Bob now both have knowledge of symmetric blowfish key and can establish a secure communication channel </li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I have looked at the openssl/rsa.h rsa implementation (since I already have practical experience with openssl/blowfish.h), and I see these two functions:</p>

<pre><code>int RSA_public_encrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa, int padding);
int RSA_private_decrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
 unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa, int padding);

<p>If Alice is to generate *rsa, how does this yield the rsa key pair? Is there something like rsa_public and rsa_private which are derived from rsa? Does *rsa contain both public and private key and the above function automatically strips out the necessary key depending on whether it requires the public or private part? Should two unique *rsa pointers be generated so that actually, we have the following:</p>

<pre><code>int RSA_public_encrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa_public, int padding);
int RSA_private_decrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
 unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa_private, int padding);
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly, in what format should the *rsa public key be sent to Bob? Must it be reinterpreted in to a character array and then sent the standard way? I've heard something about certificates -- are they anything to do with it?</p>

<h3>M2Crypto by J.F. Sebastian</h3>

<p>Sorry, that I had not thought of a possibility where I cannot correlate the certificate to the connection. I've added the requirement that I have to store the public key inside the protocol instance. Thus, using <code>peerX509.as_pem()</code> inside the <code>postConnectionCheck</code> function as suggested by J.F. Sebastian does not work. Furthermore, at least in version 0.21.1-2ubuntu3 of python-m2crypto I have to call <code>peerX509.get_rsa().as_pem()</code> to get the right public key. Using <code>peerX509.as_pem(None)</code> (since <code>peerX509.as_pem()</code> still wants a passphrase) yields excactly the same output as <code>crypto.dump_privatekey(PKey)</code> in PyOpenSSL. Maybe there is a bug.</p>

<p>Besides this, the answer showed me a possible way to write another workaround by using the following <code>Echo</code> protocol class:</p>

<pre><code>class Echo(Protocol):
    def dataReceived(self, data):
        """"""As soon as any data is received, write it back.""""""
        if self.transport.checked and not self.pubkeyStored:
            self.pubkeyStored = True
            x509 = m2.ssl_get_peer_cert(self.transport.ssl._ptr())
            if x509 is not None:
                x509 = X509.X509(x509, 1)
                pk = x509.get_pubkey()
                self.pubkey = pk.get_rsa().as_pem()
                print pk.as_pem(None)
            print self.pubkey
        self.transport.write(data)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see this uses some internal classes which I'd like to prevent. I'm hesitating submitting a small patch which would add a <code>getCert</code> method to the <code>TLSProtocolWrapper</code> class in M2Crypto.SSL.TwistedProtocolWrapper. Even if it was accepted upstream, it would break compatibility of my script with any but the most cut-of-the-edge versions of m2crypto. What would you do?</p>

<h3>External OpenSSL call by me</h3>

<p>Well, its an ugly workaround based on external system commands just which seems to me even worse than accessing non-public attributes.</p>
","<p>The analog of <code>openssl rsa -in client.key -pubout &gt; client.pub</code> command in <a href=""http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto"" rel=""nofollow""><code>M2Crypto</code></a> (a more complete openssl wrapper than pyOpenSSL) is:</p>

<pre><code>def save_pub_key(cert, filename):
    cert.get_pubkey().get_rsa().save_pub_key(filename)
</code></pre>

<p>You can use <code>M2Crypto</code> instead of <code>pyOpenSSL</code> with twisted. To add ssl capabilities to the echo server:</p>

<pre><code>from twisted.internet import protocol, reactor

class Echo(protocol.Protocol):
    def dataReceived(self, data):
        self.transport.write(data)

class EchoFactory(protocol.Factory):
    def buildProtocol(self, addr):
        return Echo()
</code></pre>

<p>You could:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
from twisted.python import log

from M2Crypto import SSL, X509
from M2Crypto.SSL import Checker
from M2Crypto.SSL.TwistedProtocolWrapper import listenSSL

log.startLogging(sys.stderr)    
cert = X509.load_cert('client.crt')
check = Checker.Checker(peerCertHash=cert.get_fingerprint('sha1'))

def postConnectionCheck(peerX509, expectedHost):
    log.msg(""client cert in pem format:\n"", peerX509.as_pem())
    save_pub_key(peerX509, 'client.pub')
    return check(peerX509, host=None) # don't check client hostname

class SSLContextFactory:
    def getContext(self):
        ctx = SSL.Context()
        ctx.load_verify_locations(cafile='ca.crt')
        ctx.load_cert(certfile='server.crt', keyfile='server.key',
                      callback=lambda *a,**kw: 'keyfile passphrase')
        ctx.set_verify(SSL.verify_peer | SSL.verify_fail_if_no_peer_cert,
                       depth=9, callback=None)
        return ctx
listenSSL(8000, EchoFactory(), SSLContextFactory(),
          interface='localhost',  reactor=reactor,
          postConnectionCheck=postConnectionCheck)
reactor.run()
</code></pre>

<p>To try it, create self-signed certificates:</p>

<pre><code>$ openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out server.crt -keyout server.key
# NOTE: server.key is unencrypted!
$ cp {server,client}.crt
$ cp {server,client}.key
$ cp {server,ca}.crt
</code></pre>

<p>and connect to the server:</p>

<pre><code>$ openssl s_client -cert client.crt -key client.key -CAfile ca.crt \
   -verify 9 -connect localhost:8000 -no_ssl2
</code></pre>

<p>The server saves the client's public key to the <code>client.pub</code> file. It is identical to the one created by <code>openssl</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ openssl rsa -in client.key -pubout &gt; openssl_client.pub
$ diff -s {openssl_,}client.pub

<p>Well, its an ugly workaround based on external system commands just which seems to me even worse than accessing non-public attributes.</p>
","<p>I made it working finally using pyOpenSSL and DerSequence class from Crypto.Util.asn1 (pyasn1 library).</p>

<p>Here is a method from my RSAKey class (pkey is a OpenSSL.crypto.PKey instance)  :</p>

<pre><code>from OpenSSL.crypto import dump_privatekey, FILETYPE_ASN1
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Util.asn1 import DerSequence
from base64 import b64decode, b64encode

...

def fromPKey_PublicKey(self, pkey):
    src = dump_privatekey(FILETYPE_ASN1, pkey)
    pub_der = DerSequence()
    pub_der.decode(src)
    self.key = RSA.construct((long(pub_der._seq[1]), long(pub_der._seq[2])))
</code></pre>

<p>The key here is that first item in pub_der._seq is zero and we dont need it.
Than you can convert RSA key stored in self.key to any format you want:</p>

<pre><code>def toPEM_PublicKey(self):
    pemSeq = DerSequence()
    pemSeq[:] = [ self.key.key.n, self.key.key.e ]
    s = b64encode(pemSeq.encode())
    src = '-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----\n'
    while True:
        src += s[:64] + '\n'
        s = s[64:]
        if s == '':
            break
    src += '-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----'
    return src
</code></pre>

<p>I am currently working with CSpace project, it uses ""ncrypt"" library ( this is another OpenSSL wrapper ) wich is not supported anymore and it gives SegFault on Linux. So I decided to replace ncrypt library with pyOpenSSL because I am using it in my project called DataHaven.NET. And getting a public key from the peer certificate in PEM format really was a problem for me. Now it is working just fine.</p>

"13845470","Extract Public Key using pyOpenSSL from certificate or other connection information","<p>I'm currently trying to write a python server script which should authenticate the current client based on its public key. Since I'm using twisted, the <a href=""http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/11.0.0/core/howto/ssl.html#auto7"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example in the twisted documenteation</a> got me started.</p>

<p>While I can generate keys, connect and communicate using the example code, I have not yet found a way to get the public key of the client in a usable format. In <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10362965/how-to-get-public-key-using-pyopenssl"">this stackexchange question</a> somebody extracts the public key from an <code>OpenSSL.crypto.PKey</code> object but cannot transform it to a readable format. Since in I have access to the <code>PKey</code> object of the x509 certificate in the <code>verifyCallback</code> method or via <code>self.transport.getPeerCertificate()</code> from any method of my Protocol, this would be a good way to go. The (not accepted) answer suggests to try <code>crypto.dump_privatekey(PKey)</code>. Unfortunately, this does not really yield the expected result:
While the <code>BEGIN PRIVATE KEY</code> and <code>BEGIN PRIVATE KEY</code> in the answer could be fixed by an easy text replacement function, the base64 string seems not match the public key. I've extracted the public key with <code>openssl rsa -in client.key -pubout &gt; client.pub</code> as mentioned <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10271197/openssl-how-to-extract-public-key"">here</a>. It does not match the result of the <code>dump_privatekey</code> function.</p>

<p>While there still is an <a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/pyopenssl/+bug/780089"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">open bug towards OpenSSL on launchpad</a>, it is not yet fixed. It was reported 19 Month ago, and there is some recent (October 2012) activity on it, I do not have any hope of a fast fix in the repos.</p>

<p>Do you have any other ideas how I could get the public key in a format comparable to the <code>client.pub</code> file I have mentioned above? Perhaps there is a twisted or OpenSSL connection specific object which holds this information. Please note that I have to store the public key in the protocol object such that I can access it later. </p>

<h2>Why is no Answer accepted?</h2>

<h3>M2Crypto by J.F. Sebastian</h3>

<p>Sorry, that I had not thought of a possibility where I cannot correlate the certificate to the connection. I've added the requirement that I have to store the public key inside the protocol instance. Thus, using <code>peerX509.as_pem()</code> inside the <code>postConnectionCheck</code> function as suggested by J.F. Sebastian does not work. Furthermore, at least in version 0.21.1-2ubuntu3 of python-m2crypto I have to call <code>peerX509.get_rsa().as_pem()</code> to get the right public key. Using <code>peerX509.as_pem(None)</code> (since <code>peerX509.as_pem()</code> still wants a passphrase) yields excactly the same output as <code>crypto.dump_privatekey(PKey)</code> in PyOpenSSL. Maybe there is a bug.</p>

<p>Besides this, the answer showed me a possible way to write another workaround by using the following <code>Echo</code> protocol class:</p>

<pre><code>class Echo(Protocol):
    def dataReceived(self, data):
        """"""As soon as any data is received, write it back.""""""
        if self.transport.checked and not self.pubkeyStored:
            self.pubkeyStored = True
            x509 = m2.ssl_get_peer_cert(self.transport.ssl._ptr())
            if x509 is not None:
                x509 = X509.X509(x509, 1)
                pk = x509.get_pubkey()
                self.pubkey = pk.get_rsa().as_pem()
                print pk.as_pem(None)
            print self.pubkey
        self.transport.write(data)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see this uses some internal classes which I'd like to prevent. I'm hesitating submitting a small patch which would add a <code>getCert</code> method to the <code>TLSProtocolWrapper</code> class in M2Crypto.SSL.TwistedProtocolWrapper. Even if it was accepted upstream, it would break compatibility of my script with any but the most cut-of-the-edge versions of m2crypto. What would you do?</p>

<h3>External OpenSSL call by me</h3>

<p>Well, its an ugly workaround based on external system commands just which seems to me even worse than accessing non-public attributes.</p>
","<p>Some of previous answers produce (apparently?) working PEM public key files, but so far as I've tried, none of them produce the same output that the 'openssl rsa -pubout -in priv.key' does. This is pretty important to my test suite, and after poking around in the (0.15.1) PyOpenSSL code, this works well for both standard PKey objects and the public-key-only PKey objects created by the x509.get_pubkey() method:</p>

<pre><code>from OpenSSL import crypto
from OpenSSL._util import lib as cryptolib


def pem_publickey(pkey):
    """""" Format a public key as a PEM """"""
    bio = crypto._new_mem_buf()
    cryptolib.PEM_write_bio_PUBKEY(bio, pkey._pkey)
    return crypto._bio_to_string(bio)


key = crypto.PKey()

<p>Once this is done, you need to build the <a href=""http://luca.ntop.org/Teaching/Appunti/asn1.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">ASN.1</a> public key structure somehow.</p>

<p>What OpenSSL exports between BEGIN/END PUBLIC KEY is an <a href=""http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509-200508-I/en"" rel=""noreferrer"">X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure</a>.</p>

<pre><code>SubjectPublicKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {

<pre><code>RSAPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {

<p>This structure needs to be serialized in DER form, then base64-encoded and then placed between the BEGIN/END delimiters.</p>

<p>Where <code>E_PREFIX</code> and <code>N_PREFIX</code> are constants that (as far as I can tell) depend on the exponent and key length. Here is a quick table I have constructed:</p>

E_PREFIX = '\x00\x00\x00\x03' # 0x10001 (65537)

","<p>AFAIK X509 encoded keys are binary files encoded using ASN.1. Therefore the question on new-lines at the end does not make any sense. </p>

<p>If you have a text file you have a PEM encoded file and I am currently not sure which KeySpec you have to use in this case. </p>

<p>You may convert the PEM encoded key to a DER encoded key (e.g. using OpenSSL) or you can use <a href=""http://www.bouncycastle.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">BouncyCastle</a> which as support for loading PEM encoded keys. </p>

<p>BTW: Using <code>keyfis.read(encKey);</code> is dangerous as the read method only reads up encKey bytes but don't have to. Better create a DataInputStream from the InputStream and use readFully(encKey):</p>

","<p>Found the solution but not sure yet if its the right solution coz I still have to get the PrivateKey and decrypt the file but for now I was able to encrypt it using the supplied PublicKey as the modulus but I don’t have the exponent and I just used some common number “65537” as the exponent
Which I read that it is not a critical part of the encryption.</p>

<p>I had to change the logic to use the RSAPublicKeySpec (which uses BigInteger and Base64Decoder)instead of X509EncodedKeySpec to set the KeySpec
And continue to use the KeyFactory object to generate the public key.
Now this logic NEEDS the modulus and exponent.</p>

<pre><code>byte[] buffer = new byte[(int) new File(file).length()];
BufferedInputStream f = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(file));
f.read(buffer);
String modulusBase64 = new String(buffer);
BASE64Decoder b64dec = new BASE64Decoder();
String exponentBase64 = ""65537"";
RSAPublicKeySpec publicKeySpec = new RSAPublicKeySpec(new BigInteger    (1,                      b64dec.decodeBuffer(modulusBase64)), new BigInteger(1,     b64dec.decodeBuffer(exponentBase64)));
KeyFactory publicKeyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
publicKey = publicKeyFactory.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);

<p>I am using gerrit + http + mysql, I am now have following problem:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As I checked my database, I can not find 'login_type' and 'login_http_head' from ""system_config"" in my database, which is described <a href=""http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn-history/r243/documentation/2.0/config-sso.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn-history/r243/documentation/2.0/config-sso.html</a></p></li>
<li><p>When I click admin->projects, a prompt said ""missing project all-projects""</p></li>
<li><p>When I checked my accounts from database, there are two empty users (I think it's because I did not set them in the UIweb page)</p></li>
<li><p>I cannot register new accounts from UIweb page, I cannot use command line create new users also.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Following are my steps for ssh-key and register:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I used <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048</code>  (Searchign from internet, I don't know what does 2048 mean)</p></li>
<li><p>I use <code>git config</code> to config a nickname and email, I registered <code>ssh-key</code> by the UIweb page.</p></li>
<li><p>use <code>ssh -p 29418 admin@localhost gerrit create-project --name example.git</code>
I got a prompt: ""Permission denied (publickkey).""</p></li>
<li><p>After searching from internet, I used <code>ssh -vv -p 29418 admin@localhost gerrit</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>I got the following output:</p>

","<p>It's been a long time since I asked this question, though due to the number of views, I would like to describe how I managed to make it worked.</p>

<p>By using the OpenSSL API, we can easily print the DER certificate in a pretty readable way. Even though its features are very limited, this is an example.</p>

<pre><code>print OpenSSL.crypto.dump_certificate(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_TEXT,x509)

<p>However, I wanted to have control over the keys in a var directly (it was needed to send it to other function), and in order to do that, I made the following function</p>

<pre><code>def parse_asn1_der(derfile):
    from pyasn1_modules import  rfc2437,rfc2459
    from pyasn1.codec.der import decoder
    certType = rfc2459.Certificate(); 
    raw=derfile #the result of open(fname,""rb"").read()
    cert,rest = decoder.decode(raw, asn1Spec=certType)
    RSAKEYSDATA=frombits(cert.getComponentByName(""tbsCertificate"").getComponentByName(""subjectPublicKeyInfo"").getComponentByName(""subjectPublicKey""))
    SignatureCert=frombits(cert.getComponentByName(""signatureValue"")).encode(""hex"")
    rsaType=rfc2437.RSAPublicKey();
    rsadata,rsadata_rest = decoder.decode(RSAKEYSDATA, asn1Spec=rsaType)
    print ""----""
    print ""Certificate Plain Data""

","<p>The above answers are somewhat old (as of 2017).</p>

<p>You can use <a href=""https://github.com/wbond/asn1crypto/"" rel=""noreferrer"">asn1crypto</a> to do this in a nicer way:</p>

<pre><code>from asn1crypto.x509 import Certificate

with open(""mycert.der"", ""rb"") as f:
    cert = Certificate.load(f.read())

n = cert.public_key.native[""public_key""][""modulus""]
e = cert.public_key.native[""public_key""][""public_exponent""]

print(""{:#x}"".format(n))    # prints the modulus (hexadecimal)
print(""{:#x}"".format(e))    # same, for the public exponent
</code></pre>

<p>It's relatively new (from what I can see, mid-2015), provides a nicer interface than the libraries already mentioned, and is much faster than <code>pyasn1</code> according to the author.</p>

","<p>I see a couple issues here.  First, the actual signing code should be included with your question as well.  Without being able to see the signing code, it's more difficult to debug the problem.  Check if your signing algorithm is the same as your verification algorithm (SHA256withRSA).  </p>

<p>Next, if you're using the <code>SHA256withRSA</code> algorithm, you don't need to calculate a message digest first.  The algorithm will calculate it for you and sign the digest.  You just pass in the entire file to be signed.</p>

<p>In your verification step, you are updating the Signature object with the same file that you are saying is the signature.  Both files are <code>Digital Signature Doctor.txt</code>.  You should update the Signature object with the file to be signed, which I believe from your example is <code>2.jpg</code>.  Then when you call the <code>verify()</code> method, pass in the signature bytes.</p>

<p>Finally, you are misinterpreting the return value of <code>verify()</code>.  It returns a boolean.  It does not return the message digest or the original message.  When your code does <code>String.valueOf(decryptmd2)</code>, the value will either be ""false"" or ""true"".</p>

<p>I'm not sure why you are trying to compare the message digests.  Let's say you are sent a message with a signature signed by a private key corresponding to a public key that you trust.  IF the <code>verify()</code> method returns true, you can be sure that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the message was signed by that person</li>
<li>the message you received is identical to the message that was signed</li>
</ul>

<p>That should be sufficient for what you need.</p>

"51228645","How can I encrypt with a RSA private key in python?","<p>Is it possible to encrypt a message with a private key in python using pycryptodome or any other library? I know that you are not supposed to encrypt with the private key and decrypt with the public key, but my purpose is to encrypt with the private one so the receiver could be sure that the message was send by the real author. More than secure encryption I'm looking for some kind of obfuscation. I want to do an app where the message is public but it can only be seen if you have the public key.
I've tried to do this:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto import Random

<ul>
<li>the code that you are using doesn't allow you to do that for security reasons</li>
<li>alternative code below</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Long answer</strong> </p>

<p>I was curious about your problem and then I started to try to code</p>

<p>After a while I realized that if you run this snippet you will see that it correctly works:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP

def generate_keys():
    modulus_length = 1024

    key = RSA.generate(modulus_length)
    #print (key.exportKey())

    pub_key = key.publickey()
    #print (pub_key.exportKey())

    return key, pub_key

def encrypt_private_key(a_message, private_key):
    encryptor = PKCS1_OAEP.new(private_key)
    encrypted_msg = encryptor.encrypt(a_message)
    print(encrypted_msg)

    decoded_decrypted_msg = encryptor.decrypt(decoded_encrypted_msg)
    print(decoded_decrypted_msg)
    #return decoded_decrypted_msg

def main():
  private, public = generate_keys()
  print (private)
  message = b'Hello world'
  encoded = encrypt_private_key(message, public)
  decrypt_public_key(encoded, private)

<p>but if you now change two of the final lines [i.e. the role of the keys] into:</p>

<pre><code>    encoded = encrypt_private_key(message, private)
    decrypt_public_key(encoded, public)
</code></pre>

<p>and rerun the program you will get the <code>TypeError: No private key</code></p>

<p>Let me quote from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/10970540/4092588"">this great answer</a>: </p>

<p>""As it turns out, PyCrypto is only trying to prevent you from mistaking one for the other here, OpenSSL or Ruby OpenSSL allow you for example to do both: public_encrypt/public_decrypt and private_encrypt/private_decrypt</p>

And that's why there is a dedicated <a href=""https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_PSS-module.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">signature package</a> in PyCrypto - this effectively does what you described, but also additionally takes care of the things I mentioned""</p>

<p>Adapting <a href=""https://gist.github.com/dennislwy/0194036234445776d48ad2fb594457d4"" rel=""noreferrer"">this link</a> I came to the following code that should solve your question:</p>

<p>Final notes: </p>

<ul>
<li>the last <code>print</code>s have <code>ascii</code> because as stated <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/45151058/4092588"">here</a> ""In case of base64 however, all characters are valid ASCII characters""</li>
<li>in this case we are using the same key - the private one - both for encrypting and decrypting, so yes: we would end up to be symmetric but...</li>
<li>but - as stated <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/20059249/4092588"">here</a> - ""The public key is PUBLIC - it's something you would readily share and thus would be easily disseminated. There's no added value in that case compared to using a symmetric cipher and a shared key"" plus ""Conceptually, ""encrypting"" with the private key is more useful for signing a message whereas the ""decryption"" using the public key is used for verifying the message""</li>
<li>the same identical last principle is expressed in <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/2124"">this answer</a> - ""Typically [...] we say sign with the private key and verify with the public key""</li>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>After being downvoted, here some more detail how I see it:</p>

<p>The OP provided this link: <a href=""https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/PLINK/Picketlink+as+SP,+Salesforce+as+IDP?_sscc=t"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/PLINK/Picketlink+as+SP,+Salesforce+as+IDP?_sscc=t</a> where it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After certificate will be generated in Salesforce, you can download it to your computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This certificate will be used to sign SAMLResponse messages sent from Salesforce IDP.</p>
  
  <p>Type self-signed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>after that, OP is told to import that cert, from which he would now like to retrieve the public key:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>keytool -import -file salesforce_idp_cert.cer -keystore jbid_test_keystore.jks -alias salesforce-idp</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it seems obvious that</p>

<ul>
<li>OP does not have the private key for that cert</li>
<li>There is no chain for this cert</li>
</ul>

","<p>Public and Private keys are encoded differently. Whilst private keys are encoded in PKCS #8, public keys are not. They are instead encoded in X.509 according to the ASN.1 specifications.</p>

<p>Description from the Key.getFormat() method:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Returns the name of the primary encoding format of this key, or null if this key does not support encoding. The primary encoding format is named in terms of the appropriate ASN.1 data format, if an ASN.1 specification for this key exists. For example, the name of the ASN.1 data format for public keys is SubjectPublicKeyInfo, as defined by the X.509 standard; in this case, the returned format is ""X.509"". Similarly, the name of the ASN.1 data format for private keys is PrivateKeyInfo, as defined by the PKCS #8 standard; in this case, the returned format is ""PKCS#8"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to this, instead of reading public keys as PKCS #8, you should read it as X.509.</p>

<p>Consider changing your public key reading code from:</p>

<pre><code>PKCS8EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(data);
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>X509EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(data);

","<p>You don't encrypt the IV. Bundle it with the encrypted key and send it (in the clear) to the recipient.</p>

<p>Standards for this do exist. This scheme is called ""KeyTransRecipientInfo"" in CMS (upon which S/MIME is based), and PGP offers a similar mode. TLS also includes the initialization vector as a parameter in the key encryption algorithm identifier, using the same ASN.1 syntax as CMS. A robust, open-source library to perform this operation is available for many, many platforms.</p>

<p>At the very least, studying the CMS specification might help avoid some of the many pitfalls in a home-brew implementation. See <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3369.txt"" rel=""noreferrer"">&sect;6.1 and &sect;6.2.1 of RFC 3369.</a></p>

<p>Assuming <code>realContact</code> is a public key ring that only contains subkeys, you don't actually need to run it through <code>getPublicKey()</code>.</p>

"25591844","WinSCP commandline: Hostkey not found in cache error","<p>I am trying to connect to Unix server from WinSCP commandline for the first time. </p>

<p>It closes with the the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The server's host key was not found in the cache. You have no guarantee that the
   server is the computer you think it is.</p>
  
  <p>The server's rsa2 key fingerprint is:

<p>In the WinSCP commandline, it does not ask for any input (Yes or No). It closes with <em>Authentication failed</em>. If I connect through the WinSCP tool, I'll get the same error. However, I'll be able to press YES. </p>

<p>I also know that If I add <code>-hostkey</code> switch in the command line, I'll be able to connect. But, I don't want pass hostkey in my batch script as I will be connecting to various servers. So, my requirement is to pass ""YES"" input from the commandline in case of this error. Can someone help?</p>
","<p>A host key fingerprint verification is a crucial step in securing your SSH connection. Even if you are using a set of sessions with your script, it does not excuse you. The fingerprint should be part of a set of information you have for each of the sessions (in addition to a hostname, an username and a password).</p>

<p>Skipping the fingerprint verification means that you lose any security and there's no point using an SSH/SFTP anymore.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you do not care about a security, you can use the <a href=""https://winscp.net/eng/docs/scriptcommand_open#hostkey"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>-hostkey=*</code> switch</a> to unconditionally accept any host key.  </p>

<p>This is a known issue with RH where directories get mislabelled and PAM prevends sshd from reading authorized_hosts when run as init script. You'll see the errors if you stumble across <code>/var/log/audit/audit.log</code>. Rare it seems but painful when it happens!</p>

<p>More details at <a href=""https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=499343"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=499343</a></p>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL POST</strong></p>

<p>I've just hit what looks like exactly this problem. I had a poorly tuned VirtualBox (I hadn't told vbox to use 64bit) -- which when I cloned and restarted (in vbox RedHat 64-bit mode), started asking me for a password.</p>

<p>The original image was fine -- with identical settings -- so I think the suggestion of being networking-related might be relevant, or else to do with server keys.</p>

<p>The weird thing however is that if on the box, I kill the sshd process which autostarted, then manually run /usr/sbin/sshd as root, I can log in passwordless fine.  <strong>A silly workaround, but usable.</strong></p>

<p>So it is an /etc/init.d/sshd issue.  But I haven't been able to track down what it is ... have tried chucking out most of the stuff in that script but it still prompts for password when invoked as <code>/etc/init.d/sshd start</code> but not when at <code>/usr/sbin/sshd</code>.</p>

<p>Maybe these comments can help, and someone can then help further!?</p>

","<p>Let's say <code>alice</code> is a github.com user, with 2 or more private repositories <code>repoN</code>.
For this example we'll work with just two repositories named <code>repo1</code> and <code>repo2</code></p>

<p><code>https://github.com/alice/repo1</code></p>

<p><code>https://github.com/alice/repo2</code></p>

<p>You need to be to pull from these repositories without entering a passwords probably on a server, or on multiple servers.
You want to perform <code>git pull origin master</code> for example, and you want this to happen without asking for a password.</p>

<p>You don't like dealing with ssh-agent, you have discovered (or you're discovering now) about <code>~/.ssh/config</code> a file that let's your ssh client know what private key to use depending on Hostname and username, with a simple configuration entry that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile /home/alice/.ssh/alice_github.id_rsa
  IdentitiesOnly yes
</code></pre>

<p>So you went ahead and created your <code>(alice_github.id_rsa, alice_github.id_rsa.pub)</code> keypair, you then also went to your repository's <code>.git/config</code> file and you modified the url of your remote <code>origin</code> to be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[remote ""origin""]
        url = ""ssh://git@github.com/alice/repo1.git""
</code></pre>

<p>And finally you went to the repository <code>Settings &gt; Deploy keys</code> section and added the contents of <code>alice_github.id_rsa.pub</code></p>

<p>At this point you could do your <code>git pull origin master</code> without entering a password without issue.</p>

<h3>but what about the second repository?</h3>

<p>So your instinct will be to grab that key and add it to <code>repo2</code>'s Deploy keys, but github.com will error out and tell you that the key is already being used.</p>

<p>Now you go and generate another key (using <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -C ""alice@alice.com""</code> without passwords of course), and so that this doesn't become a mess, you will now name your keys like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>repo1</code> keypair: <code>(repo1.alice_github.id_rsa, repo1.alice_github.id_rsa.pub)</code></li>
<li><code>repo2</code> keypair: <code>(repo2.alice_github.id_rsa, repo2.alice_github.id_rsa.pub)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You will now put the new public key on <code>repo2</code>'s Deploy keys configuration at github.com, but now you have an ssh problem to deal with. </p>

<h3>How can ssh tell which key to use if the repositories are hosted on the same <code>github.com</code> domain?</h3>

<p>Your <code>.ssh/config</code> file points to <code>github.com</code> and it doesn't know which key to use when it's time to do the pull.</p>

<p>So I found a trick with github.com. You can tell your ssh client that each repository lives in a different github.com subdomain, in these cases, they will be <code>repo1.github.com</code> and <code>repo2.github.com</code></p>

<p>So first thing is editing the <code>.git/config</code> files on your repo clones, so they look like this instead:</p>

<p>For repo1</p>

<pre><code>[remote ""origin""]
        url = ""ssh://git@repo1.github.com/alice/repo1.git""
</code></pre>

<p>For repo2</p>

<p>[remote ""origin""]
        url = ""ssh://git@repo2.github.com/alice/repo2.git""</p>

<p>And then, on your <code>.ssh/config</code> file, now you will be able to enter a configuration for each subdomain :)</p>

<pre><code>Host repo1.github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile /home/alice/.ssh/repo1.alice_github.id_rsa
  IdentitiesOnly yes

Host repo2.github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile /home/alice/.ssh/repo2.alice_github.id_rsa
  IdentitiesOnly yes
</code></pre>

<p>Now you are able to <code>git pull origin master</code> without entering any passwords from both repositories.</p>

<p>If you have multiple machines, you could copy the keys to each of the machines and reuse them, but I'd advise doing the leg work to generate 1 key per machine and repo. You will have a lot more keys to handle, but you will be less vulnerable if one gets compromised.</p>

<p>FTP is working fine, but working with SFTP it requires host key.</p>

<p>When I worked with WinSCP application directly it warns for the host key and user is able to copy host key by clicking on ""Copy key"" button.</p>

<p>Host key will be copied to clipboard and we can use this key to download files from SFTP or SCP.</p>

<p>There is also an option that user can suppress the use of host key.</p>

<p>I want to suppress the use of host key programmatically.</p>

<p>Let me know if there required any other information.</p>
","<p>What do you mean by <em>""suppress the use of host key""</em>?</p>

<p>There's no option to suppress use of the host key in WinSCP application. You have an option to accept the host key and remember it, to accept the key without remembering it, and to reject the key (and abandon the connection).<br>
<a href=""https://winscp.net/eng/docs/ssh_verifying_the_host_key"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://winscp.net/eng/docs/ssh_verifying_the_host_key</a></p>

<p>The WinSCP .NET assembly does not have the first option built-in, as it (by default) does not keep any configuration, so it cannot store the accepted keys anywhere. That's by design. It's your task to set the <a href=""https://winscp.net/eng/docs/library_sessionoptions#sshhostkeyfingerprint"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>SessionOptions.SshHostKeyFingerprint</code></a>. Either:</p>

<ul>
<li>hard-code the host key fingerprint;</li>
<li>or load it from any configuration your application have (i.e. possibly from the same configuration you load host name or user name); </li>
<li>or <a href=""https://winscp.net/eng/docs/library_example_known_hosts"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">implement SSH host key cache (known hosts)</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your code does not show implementation of <code>OpenSession</code>, what is a key piece here, so it's not clear what you are trying to do.</p>

<p>If you do not care about the host key (<em>meaning you do not care about security at all</em>), you can make WinSCP accept any host key unconditionally using the <a href=""https://winscp.net/eng/docs/library_sessionoptions#giveupsecurityandacceptanysshhostkey"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>SessionOption.GiveUpSecurityAndAcceptAnySshHostKey</code></a>.<br>
But that's for use in exceptional situations only, where SSH security is unnecessary overhead. Like when both your application and server are within an isolated network.</p>

","<p>Be aware, that <code>Get-PfxCertificate</code> temporarily stores your private key at <code>%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys</code>, where <strong>everyone</strong> could read it.</p>

<p>If that is not a desirable behavior, than you should probably use either <code>import</code> method or constructor of the <code>X509Certificate2</code> .NET object with <code>EphemeralKeySet</code> as a key storage flag, which indicates that private key should be created in memory and not persisted on disk when importing a certificate, e.g.:</p>

<pre class=""lang-bsh prettyprint-override""><code>$Cert = New-Object -TypeName System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2
$FullPathToCert = Resolve-Path -Path .\cert.pfx
$Password = Read-Host 'Password' -AsSecureString
$X509KeyStorageFlag = 32
$Cert.Import($FullPathToCert, $Password, $X509KeyStorageFlag)
$Cert.GetPublicKey()

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>EphemeralKeySet</code> flag supported by <em>.NET Framework 4.7.2</em>, <em>.NET Core 2.0</em> and above;</li>
<li><code>$X509KeyStorageFlag = 32</code> is just a shorthand for the <code>$X509KeyStorageFlag = [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509KeyStorageFlags]::EphemeralKeySet</code></li>

<p>But something goes wrong.It gives InvalidKeySpecException. I thing this cannot read the keys from file.How can i fix this problem? Thank you.</p>
","<p>Thanks for the accepted code above (maybe below). However, in my case, the 'getPrivatekey()' throws an InvalidKeySpecException. It says 'Unknown KeySpc type: java.secrity.spec.X509EncodedKeySpec'. The solution I used is to replace X509EncodedKeySpec with PKCS8EncodedKeySpec. Then it works!

","<p>There is a few options for you...</p>

<h3>GEM SERVER</h3>

<p>Install the gem on any server you want to distribute it from. Then run <code>gem server</code> on the machine. This will start up a small gem server that can be queried by anyone. Then just add the new gem source to the client machines. <code>gem sources -a &lt;server&gt;</code>. </p>

<ul>
<li>Pros: Extremely easy to setup. Can be launched on any port.</li>
<li>Cons: Doesn't offer key based authentication.</li>
</ul>

<h3>GITOSIS</h3>

<p>Setup a gitosis server and store the gem source code on there. Then just pull from the repo and build the gem when you need to update it. Yes it is an extra couple of steps to build and install the gem, however you will get key based authentication for better security.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pros: Offers key based authentication</li>
<li>Cons: Have to pull the source, build, then install the gem on each update. You also have to actually setup the gitosis server.</li>
</ul>

<h3>GITHUB</h3>

<p>Exact same thing as gitosis, but you have to pay to make it private. This requires no setup if you can afford it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pros: Offers key based authentication</li>
<li>Cons: Have to pull the source, build, then install the gem on each update. Costs a little money.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, none of the major gem services do exactly what you need. Github stopped building gems, and RubyGems doesn't offer any private gem hosting. Hopefully one of the tools above will work well enough for you. Personally I would just go with the gem server option, then lock the machine down by IP, or some other access restriction. I know its not perfect, but it works and is quick/easy to setup.</p>

","<p>A public key by itself would let them decrypt any encrypted information sent out by the server. That's it. Going from public key to private key is <em>exceptionally</em> hard; that's how public key cryptography works. (By “exceptionally” I mean that it's designed to be resistant to well-funded government efforts; if it keeps the NSA from cracking you, it'll be sure good enough for stopping Joe Blow.)</p>

<p>Note that it doesn't help with DRM, which it sounds a bit like you're trying to do. DRM is just plain broken by design; if the attacker has the information and the key to unlock it in devices local to him, it's already game over. If you give a key to an attacker, it might as well be public since he's sure not going to be willing to keep it secret…</p>

","<p>The point is that this sort of encryption is designed to protect the content of the message and to verify sender authenticity which in this case is clearly known to the user i.e. Name and Vendor etc. Much nicer would be to protect a section of the code with this sort of encryption such that crucial bits of code stays garbled until the proper key is used.</p>

","<p>Public keys are used everywhere -- logon forms, security of banking transactions, client-side authentication etc. So the short answer is that you shouldn't worry, cause lots of other, smarter people have looked at this problem and accepted the distribution of public keys to endpoints.</p>

<p>What can people tell from your public key? They would obviously know a key name and key length. I assume that the key is part of a certificate, which could also contain some details about your company and website URL.</p>

<p>My questions to you are:</p>

<p>1) Why are you worried about a public key in an executable? Any half-decent cracker would just change your executable to bypass the public key check altogether. The fact that the encryption is strong is meaningless when you're giving a binary to the client that can be modified.</p>

<p>2) Are you aware of the mess you may be getting yourself into? There's nothing inherently wrong with using public key encryption to secure a binary, but you may end up with problems as the system develops. Things such as expired keys, key roll-overs and key issuance (I believe this is a tool you're developing to sell) can become a major pain. And, yet, you'll still be stuck with the reality that your bigger challenge is stopping crackers from just rerouting the binary to avoid your security check altogether.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you are talking about the key to verify apps on install : you can use any key to sign an app and install it via adb. <em>But</em>, you will have to use the same key to re-install an app. In that case, keys are not checked against a global repo like with Google Play, they are just checked locally.</p>

<p>For testing, things are a bit different, I believe it's due to interaction of instrumentation runner and the code under test, they have to be run in the same process so, if you install an app's test package with a debug certificate, then you can't install the app using a release certificate, either you install the app with debug certificate as well, or you uninstall the tests.</p>

<p>Some parts of the link will resolve your question
Embed your public key for licensing</p>

<p>For each application, the Google Play service automatically generates a 2048-bit RSA public/private key pair that is used for licensing and in-app billing. The key pair is uniquely associated with the application. Although associated with the application, the key pair is not the same as the key that you use to sign your applications (or derived from it).</p>

<p>The Google Play Developer Console exposes the public key for licensing to any developer signed in to the Developer Console, but it keeps the private key hidden from all users in a secure location. When an application requests a license check for an application published in your account, the licensing server signs the license response using the private key of your application's key pair. When the LVL receives the response, it uses the public key provided by the application to verify the signature of the license response.</p>

<p>To add licensing to an application, you must obtain your application's public key for licensing and copy it into your application. Here's how to find your application's public key for licensing:</p>

<p>Go to the Google Play Developer Console and sign in. Make sure that you sign in to the account from which the application you are licensing is published (or will be published).
In the application details page, locate the Services &amp; APIs link and click it.
In the Services &amp; APIs page, locate the Licensing &amp; In-App Billing section. Your public key for licensing is given in the Your License Key For This Application field.
To add the public key to your application, simply copy/paste the key string from the field into your application as the value of the String variable BASE64_PUBLIC_KEY. When you are copying, make sure that you have selected the entire key string, without omitting any characters.</p>

<p>Here's an example from the LVL sample application:</p>

<pre><code>public class MainActivity extends Activity {
    private static final String BASE64_PUBLIC_KEY = ""MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG ... ""; //truncated for this example
...
}

","<p>An embedded key can be replaced. Generally speaking, if the client's machine is not secured by non-software means, you cannot prevent hacking of your client by a sufficiently motivated attacker. Even a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>TPM</code></a> is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">no panacea</a>. The question becomes one of trade-off: attackers' man-hours vs. utility (profit, fame &amp;c) gained. The only really secure way to license a program which does computations is to perform all licensable computations on a server you physically control; <code>https</code> or <code>SSL</code> can be made sufficiently secure by choosing appropriate key lengths, hashing schemes, ciphers &amp;c (a subject of which I know little).</p>

<p>The principle here is actually rather simple: you need to engineer a situation in which it will be in your clients' best interests to protect their passwords/license keys/data/whatever. E.g. if you have a computation server and charge your clients for server time, client keys are proxies to owners' bank accounts.</p>

","<p>Well private key algorithms usually offers better performances (by an order of magnitude or more as far as I can remember) then their public key counterpart. In that sense Diffie-Hellman would be more efficient then say RSA for a client-server architecture.</p>

<p>If you have far far more clients then servers, you could implement a public-key algorithm to reduce the exchanges between them.</p>

<p>Still, like many people said, you should consider asking/hiring an expert on the matter as there is many different types of attacks (most of them targeting only the implementation and not the algorithm per se).

// verify signature of contents matches signature passed to method somehow (and this is where I'm stuck)

","<p>Encryption and keying methods are a very deep and complex topic that only the smartest mathematical minds in the world can fully understand, but there are top-level views that most people can understand.</p>

<p>The primary difference is that symmetric algorithms require a much, much smaller key than asymmetric (PKI) methods. Because symmetric algorithms work on a ""shared secret"" (such as <code>abcd1234</code>) which is transferred inside a trusted communication method (for example, I'm going to call you on the telephone and ask you for the shared secret) then they don't need to be as long as they rely on other methods of security (i.e. I trust you not to tell that to anyone).</p>

<p>PK infrastructure involves sending that ""key"" over the internet, over un-trusted space, and involves using huge prime numbers and massive keys (1024-bit or 2048-bit rather than 128 or 256-bit for example).</p>

<p>A general rule of thumb is that PKI methods are approximately 1,000 times slower than a symmetric key.</p>

","<p><a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Public-key_cryptography#Computational_cost"" rel=""noreferrer"">Public-key cryptography</a> is a form of <a href=""http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Asymmetric_key_algorithm"" rel=""noreferrer"">asymmetric cryptography</a>, in which the difference is the use of an extra cryptographic key.</p>

<p><a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Symmetric_key_algorithm"" rel=""noreferrer"">Symmetric algorithms</a> use a ""shared secret"" in which two systems each use a single cryptographic key to encrypt <em>and</em> decrypt communications.</p>

<p>Public-key cryptography does not use a single shared key, instead it uses mathematical key-pairs: a public and private key.  In this system the communications are encrypted with the public key and is decrypted with the private key.  Here is a better explanation from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The distinguishing technique used in
  public key cryptography is the use of
  asymmetric key algorithms, where the
  key used to encrypt a message is not
  the same as the key used to decrypt
  it. Each user has a pair of
  cryptographic keys—a public encryption
  key and a private decryption key. The
  publicly available encrypting-key is
  widely distributed, while the private
  decrypting-key is known only to the
  recipient. Messages are encrypted with
  the recipient's public key and can
  only be decrypted with the
  corresponding private key. The keys
  are related mathematically, but the
  private key cannot feasibly (ie. in
  actual or projected practice) be
  derived from the public key. The
  discovery of algorithms that could
  produce public/private key pairs
  revolutionized the practice of
  cryptography beginning in the middle
  1970s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The computational overhead is then quite obvious:  the public key is available to any system it's exposed to (a public-key system on the internet, for example exposes the public-key to the <em>entire</em> internet).  To compensate, both public and private keys will have to be quite large to ensure a stronger level of encryption.  The result, however, is a much stronger level of encryption, as the private decryption key (so far) cannot be reverse-engineered from the public encryption key.</p>

<p>There is more that can affect the ""speed"" of a <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure"" rel=""noreferrer"">public-key infrastructure</a> (PKI).  Since one of the issues with this system is trust, most implementations involve a <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Certificate_authority"" rel=""noreferrer"">certificate authority</a> (CA), which are entities that are trusted to delegate key pairs and validate the keys' ""identity"".</p>

<p>So to summarize:  larger cryptographic key sizes, two cryptographic keys instead of one, and with the introduction of a certificate authority: extra DNS look-ups, and server response times.</p>

<p>It's because of this extra overhead that most implementations benefit from a <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Hybrid_cryptosystem"" rel=""noreferrer"">hybrid algorithm</a>, where the public and private keys are used to generate a session key (much like a shared secret in symmetrical algorithms) to gain the best of both worlds.  </p>

","<p>Public key algorithms rely on ""trapdoor"" calculations, ones that are computationally expensive to encrypt and computationally intractable to decrypt with the secret key.  If the first step is too easy (which correlates with speed), the second step becomes less hard (more breakable).  Consequently, public key algorithms tend to be resource intensive.</p>

<p>Private key algorithms already have the secret during the encryption phase, so they don't have to do as much work as an algorithm with a public secret.</p>

<p>The above is an over-generalization but should give you a feel for the reasons behind the relative speed differences.  That being said, a private key algorithm can be slow and a public key algorithm may have an efficient implementation.  The devil is in the details :-)</p>

<li><p>You are confusing the SSH server public host key verification with the client public key authentication. These are two completely different things. This first involves the public key of the server, while the latter involves your account public key.</p>

<li><p>FileZilla <strong>cannot</strong> connect without verifying the server's public host key either. On the first connection it always prompts you to accept the key. Once you do, it optionally caches the key and won't prompt you again, unless the key changes.</p>

<p>SUMMARY:</p>

<p>Thank you all for setting me on the right path, it was difficult to choose just one answer! :)</p>

<p>I've concluded that I need to use SSL, and while I yet have a lot of confusion about the how-tos, I know that this requires a certificate, and that once the certificate is set up, the client can request encryption by asking for ""Encrypt=yes"" in the connection string. Luckily I believe I already have one I can use.</p>

<p>Another thing to note - TDE is the consensus on what is good for encrypting data that is just sitting in the database, while SSL is what to use for transmitting encrypted data.</p>

","<p>You don't generate prime numbers exactly. You generate a large odd number randomly, then test if that number is prime, if not generate another one randomly.  There are some laws of prime numbers that basically state that your odds of ""hitting"" a prime via random tries is (2/ln n) </p>

<p>For example, if you want a 512-bit random prime number, you will find one in 2/(512*ln(2))
So roughly 1 out of every 177 of the numbers you try will be prime.  </p>

<p>There are multiple ways to test if a number is prime, one good one is the ""Miller-Rabin test"" <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/1146285/106092"">as stated in another answer to this question</a>. </p>

<p>I need to convert this into the following format</p>

<p>Basically, the issue is that I am working with a third party library which is written in Java.</p>

</ol>

<p><code>
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
xxxxxxxx
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
</code></p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>After poking around with the code a bit, I could see that if I use the java class ""X509EncodedKeySpec"" to load this public key, the signature verification portion of my code works perfectly. However, since the code is a third-party library, I don't have an option of changing the class type in their code. I would need to somehow make sure that the input I am supplying to the library is compatible with ""RSAPublicKeySpec"" class so that the public key is loaded correctly.</li>
</ol>
","<p>The ""RSA PUBLIC KEY"" format was used in very early SSLeay, which evolved into OpenSSL, but obsoleted before 2000 I believe, which was very early days for Java and I <em>think</em> before Java had <em>any</em> crypto even the restricted kind then allowed for export from the US. In short, the ""RSA PUBLIC KEY"" format is the RSA-specific format from PKCS#1, whereas ""PUBLIC KEY"" is the X.509 generic structure that handles numerous (and extensible) algorithm. So it would be interesting to know how the developers of your Java library got themselves into this bizarre limitation. But anyway ...</p>

<p>Although this format is long obsolete, <strong>OpenSSL still supports</strong> it. If you have the openssl commandline available (could be on another system which you copy the file/data to and back) just do:</p>

<pre><code>openssl rsa -in publickey.pem -out rsapublickey.pem -pubin -RSAPublicKey_out 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Argh!</strong> having written the below, now I notice the (more general) dupe at <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7611383/generating-rsa-keys-in-pkcs1-format-in-java?rq=1"">Generating RSA keys in PKCS#1 format in Java</a>
(plus several links onward from there) if you use BouncyCastle in Java (or OpenSSL library in C, but you already have the OpenSSL commandline option above).</p>

<p>Anyway, here is an outline of two ways to code in <strong>plain Java</strong> if you prefer that:</p>

<p>0) Both of them <strong>start by converting the input PEM to bytes</strong>. Read the ""----BEGIN"" line and preferably check it's correct; read all following lines (of base64) up to but not including the ""-----END"" line; concatenate and decode the base64 to bytes. Java8 provides <code>java.util.Base64</code>; before that you had to fiddle with ""internal"" classes or add one of several common (but not builtin) libraries like commons-codecs or write it yourself (which isn't that hard). Now choose either step 1 or step 2.</p>

<p>1) <strong>Parse</strong> those bytes as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ASN.1 DER</a> encoding of an <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo as shown in RFC 5280</a> including the <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.1.2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AlgorithmIdentifier</a>. To be exact: skip the tag and length of the outer sequence; skip the tag, length and contents of the AlgorithmIdentifier -- or better extract the contents and check it is a SEQUENCE of an OID for rsaEncryption and NULL (or possibly omitted) params; then skip the tag and length and first byte (unused-bits) for the <strong>BIT STRING</strong> and take the (remaining) <strong>contents</strong> as the encoded key -- which is already the PKCS#1 RSAPublicKey structure you want. Proceed to step 3.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Or</strong> use standard JCE to <strong>read the X.509 format</strong> key: wrap the bytes in an <code>X509EncodedKeySpec</code>, give it to <code>.generatePublic()</code> of a <code>KeyFactory</code> for RSA, and cast the result to <code>RSAPublicKey</code>. Then call <code>.getModulus()</code> and <code>.getPublicExponent()</code> to <strong>get the mathematical values and encode them</strong> in ASN.1 DER with the structure <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#appendix-A.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RSAPublicKey defined in PKCS#1 rfc3447</a> (used for PKIX/X.509 in rfc3279 2.2.1). <code>BigInteger.toByteArray()</code> gives exactly the big-endian signed two's-complement form that ASN.1 wants, so this consists of:
get both <code>.toByteArray()</code> values, add tag=INTEGER (0x02) and length prefixes to each one, then add a tag=SEQUENCE-composite (0x30) and length prefix to their concatenation. Then proceed to step 3.</p>

<p>3) Now you have the bytes constituting a PKCS#1 RSAPublicKey, <strong>convert to PEM</strong>: encode to base64; break into lines (at 64 chars) if needed, or always to be safe; and add ""BEGIN"" and ""END"" lines, unless not needed.</p>

","<p>Actually, if you use RSA <em>properly</em>, then you cannot even guess your 'XXX' by trying the 1000 possibilities.

<p>The <a href=""https://www.emc.com/emc-plus/rsa-labs/standards-initiatives/pkcs-rsa-cryptography-standard.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PKCS#1 RSA standard</a> specifies two types of padding; both include a bunch of random bytes. A consequence is the following: if you encrypt twice the same message with the same key, you will get two <em>distinct</em> encrypted messages. The point is, precisely, to avoid the situation which you allude to: being able to ""guess"" the encrypted message and verify whether the guess is right or not, with only the public key (which is public, hence assumed to be known by every attacker).</p>

<p>Therefore, to answer your question: <em>if</em> you can find your 'XXX', either by trying only 1000 RSA encryption, or through any kind of clever shortcut, <em>then</em> your RSA is very wrong.</p>

<p>Some things will be more difficult than others. For example, its obvious what a <code>RSA PUBLIC KEY</code> is, but its not so obvious what a <code>PUBLIC KEY</code> is. In this case, you do one of two things. First, you ASN.1/DER decode the thing and then look ups its OID if available. Second, you try and load into a data structure that you expect the thing to be.</p>

<p>As an example of the second strategy, you would attempt to load a PEM blob into a RSA private key with <code>PEM_read_bio_RSAPrivateKey</code>. If it succeeds, then its a RSA private key. If its fails, then it may be a damaged RSA private key, or it may be an EC private key, or it may not be a PEM blob.</p>

<li>When the user tries to login later, the website asks the user for his corresponding private key.</li>
<li>User is authenticated if the private key matches the public key which the user provided while signing up.</li>

<ol>
<li>The user signs up, using the plain old username and password pair. He is also asked to enter at least one public key (other ones can be added later from a profile administration panel)</li>
<li>The server stores the user's public key and associates it with its user in a certificate</li>
<li>Next time the client makes a request presenting his certificate (this should be handled by the browser, thus happening transparently to the user), the SSL engine on the server side checks if it <em>knows</em> the client and if it does the request is processed and the <em>application</em> code will authenticate and authorize the user since it knows the link between a public key and an user. If the client is <strong>not</strong> identified, the server should redirect to some page to allow signin up or manual login (maybe to add a new public key)</li>

<p><strong>[umask]</strong> However, when a user logs in and <code>put</code>s a file, the uploaded file takes the permissions that it had originally (I'm testing using OS X and Linux as clients, so that makes sense). I have not tested the pure FTP solution, but I'd rather provide SFTP.</p>

<p><strong>[pk auth]</strong> When I attempt a PK authentication, the client correctly offers the right key, and says</p>

<pre><code>debug2: we sent a publickey packet, wait for reply
debug1: Server accepts key: pkalg ssh-rsa blen 535
debug2: input_userauth_pk_ok: fp SHA256:Eft1LIOozSylL20lfMc9gUdl3gKtd0zEdeyNtCb1p8Q
</code></pre>

<p>but then concludes with</p>

<pre><code>debug1: Authentications that can continue: password
</code></pre>

<p>which confuses me to no end. On the server side, I have</p>

<pre><code>no account for user 'sftpuser' found
sending userauth failure; remaining userauth methods: password
</code></pre>

<p>which is funny because the user does indeed exist (and can successfully perform a password login). I even converted my OpenSSH key to the RFC4716 format that ProFTPD appears to prefer.</p>

<p>I admit I have a grand total of about 4 hours of experience with ProFTPD, but I've been reading all I could, and the config files make sense to me. This all is running in a Docker container. What am I missing?</p>
","<p>Unlike FTP, SFTP uploads often contain their own permissions <em>as part of the SFTP <code>OPEN</code> request</em>.  To make SFTP uploads behave more like FTP uploads, with regard to ProFTPD configuration (<em>e.g.</em> <code>Umask</code>), you want to configure <code>mod_sftp</code> to <em>ignore</em> the upload permissions using the <code>IgnoreSFTPUploadPerms</code> <a href=""http://www.proftpd.org/docs/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPOptions"" rel=""nofollow""><code>SFTPOptions</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_sftp.c&gt;
  ...
  SFTPOptions IgnoreSFTPUploadPerms
  ...
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For the publickey authentication issue, the <code>SFTPLog</code> you configured should have more clues as to what might be the issue.  Perhaps the configured file does not exist, or does not have the necessary permissions?  Keep in mind that <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> is often used by OpenSSH, <em>and</em> that the format that file is different that what ProFTPD desires.  For that reason, I often use:</p>

<pre><code>SFTPAuthorizedUserKeys file:~/.sftp/authorized_keys
</code></pre>

<p><em>i.e.</em> a <em>different</em> file from what OpenSSH wants, in a different format (RFC 4716), to avoid any possible confusion/collision.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

"25978461","StrictHostKeyChecking config on PSFTP.EXE","<p>I come accross <code>StrictHostKeyChecking</code> configuration when I needed to setup <code>sftp</code> communication between two servers (e.g. Windows Server ---> Linux Server). As defined <a href=""http://www.computerhope.com/unix/sftp.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> (use find for string match ""StrictHostKeyChecking""): </p>

<p>If this flag is set to “yes”, ssh will never automatically add host keys to the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, and refuses to connect to hosts whose host key has changed. This option forces the user to manually add all new hosts. If this flag is set to “no”, ssh will automatically add new host keys to the user known hosts files.</p>

<p>I want to use <code>PSFTP.EXE</code> to transfer files to the Unix server from Windows machine and there is obviously no concept of <code>~/.ssh/known_hosts</code>. My question is then...what is the equivalent for <code>StrictHostKeyChecking</code> for <code>PSFTP.EXE</code>. Is it simple <code>-batch</code> which avoids interactive prompts ?</p>
","<p>By default all PuTTY tools (including <code>psftp</code>) behave as <code>StrictHostKeyChecking=ask</code>.</p>

<p>With <code>-batch</code>, <code>psftp</code> (and <code>pscp</code> and <code>plink</code>) behave as <code>StrictHostKeyChecking=yes</code>. 
If you use this switch and <code>psftp</code> finds that server's host key has changed you will get:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WARNING - POTENTIAL SECURITY BREACH! The server's host key does not
  match the one PuTTY has cached in the registry. This means that either
  the server administrator has changed the host key, or you have
  actually connected to another computer pretending to be the server.<br>
  The new ... key fingerprint is:<br>
  ...<br>
  <strong>Connection abandoned.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While without the switch (the default behavior), you will get an interactive prompt.</p>

<p>Likewise for the host key of a new server.</p>

<p>The <code>psftp</code> (nor any other PuTTY tool) <strong>never</strong> behaves as <code>StrictHostKeyChecking=no</code>.  </p>

<p>Obviously the <code>-batch</code> affects all other prompts too, not just host key prompts (comparing with <code>StrictHostKeyChecking</code>). There are these prompts in <code>psftp</code> (<code>pscp</code> and <code>plink</code>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Username, passphrase, password, password change and keyboard-interactive prompts (connection aborts with <code>-batch</code>)</li>
<li>Insecure algorithm prompt (the same behavior as with host key prompt)</li>

","<p>Symmetric and asymmetric ciphers are two completely different things. You cannot directly compare them.</p>

<p>Symmetric ciphers are used to encrypt a message with a shared secret. These are algorithms such as DES, AES, blowfish, etc.</p>

<p>Asymmetric ciphers deal with an other issue, namely key-sharing and signatures. By being able to have a public key, it is possible to distribute that key through a channel that cannot be modified. Others can read the key; as long as they cannot alter it there is no problem.</p>

<p>If others can alter the messages (this is usually the case anywhere) then it becomes more complicated. Then you need to use digital signatures. There is basically a central authority who signs public keys (certificates are also public keys). Everybody has the public keys of the certificate authority pre-installed (usually bundled with the OS) and therefore can verify that certificates are authentic by checking the signature using the authority's public key. This is referred to as a PKI (public key infrastructure) and it is used all over the place. Most prominent example is SSL.</p>

","<p>As Krystian says, Diffie-Hellman lets you establish a secure connection, but doesn't let you verify <em>who</em> that secure connection is with.</p>

<p>However, DH can be used in combination with a public key algorithm like RSA.  This allows you to verify the other party's identity (using an RSA signature), and the Diffie-Hellman key exchange brings to the party a property called <em>perfect forward secrecy</em>.  This means that if you and I talk today, and next year somebody steals your RSA private key, they still can't go back and decrypt today's conversation.

","<p>You can store in Blob, you can read the public key file and get java public key object. You can directly store this publickey object in database as blob. First do :</p>

<pre><code> byte [] bytes = publicKey.getEncoded();
</code></pre>

<p>then store bytes in database.
For retrieving public key do as:</p>

<pre><code>public PublicKey blobToPublicKey(final byte[] blob) 
    {
        Object result = null;
        final ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(blob);

        try

            ois = new ObjectInputStream(bais);
            result = ois.readObject();
        }

<p>Well, the key on disk is likely PEM encoded. Because its a public key, it probably has the pre- and post- encapsulated boundaries of <code>-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----</code> and <code>-----END PUBLIC KEY-----</code>. You can read it like that using standard library functions.</p>

<p>You can also read the public key with <a href=""http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/pem.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>PEM_read_PUBKEY</code></a>. The function returns a <code>EVP_PKEY*</code>. I believe you can convert the <code>EVP_PKEY*</code> to a <code>EC_KEY*</code> with:</p>

<pre><code>EC_KEY* ecKey = EVP_PKEY_get1_EC_KEY(pKey);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>get1</code> above means the reference count on the key was bumped (as opposed to <code>get0</code>). Be sure to call <code>EC_KEY_free</code> when done with it.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how you would read the public key into an array given a <code>EVP_PKEY*</code> or <code>EC_KEY*</code>. At minimum, there are two pieces of information: the curve (like <code>secp256k1</code>) and the public element (a point on the curve, which consists of an <code>(x,y)</code> coordinate). If the named curve (i.e., the OID) is <em>not</em> present (i.e., the absence of the <code>OPENSSL_EC_NAMED_CURVE</code> flag), then you have all the domain parameters like <code>p</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>G</code>, etc. Perhaps you should look at an ASN.1/DER encoding. I think that's the closet you are going to get.</p>

<p>Any idea of what am I doing wrong? Thanks for the help in advance.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>As suggested by @dave_thompson_085 what I actually want is to export the whole certificate in PEM format, so the valid code is like this:</p>

<pre><code>//...
Certificate cert = keyStore.getCertificate(alias);
StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
PemWriter pemWriter = new PemWriter(writer);
pemWriter.writeObject(new PemObject(""CERTIFICATE"", cert.getEncoded()));
//...
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>Your <code>keytool</code> example does a JKS not a P12, but adding <code>-storetype pkcs12</code> would do P12 so I'll assume that's what you meant. More importantly, <code>keytool -exportcert</code> (which officially superseded <code>-export</code> in about 1.5) exports the <strong>whole certificate, not just the public key.</strong> Specifying <code>-rfc</code> does it in PEM format, and omitting <code>-rfc</code> does it in DER format, but either way it's the whole certificate. </p>

<p>Also your second code should not produce the same result; it should produce, perhaps modulo line breaks, the same as the <em>body</em> of the PEM format, but without the dashed BEGIN and END lines. The BEGIN and END lines are part of the PEM format, and without them it's not PEM. And without stating the <em>correct</em> type of the contents, which you don't, it's not correct PEM.</p>

<p>If you really want just the publickey you can do that, but don't expect it to be the same as the certificate because a publickey is not a certificate. Note that there there are very few applications that can use a publickey by itself without the other data in the certificate; the only one that springs to mind is SSH (which supposedly confirms the identity and validity manually), and OpenSSH does not use the ASN1-based ""X509"" (really SPKI) encoding supported by Java JCE but instead its own base64-MPI-based encoding.</p>

<li>Your public key is required while generating client-side page.</li>
<li>The client uses this public key to request from recaptcha: an image, a corresponding correct answer and perhaps an id. Of course the answer and the id comes encrypted, using the public key. (So the client cannot know the answer)</li>
<li>User types in the answer, sends it to your server.</li>
<li>You have: {id, answer} encrypted using public key. You send your private key and this encrypted message to recaptcha server.</li>
<li>recaptcha unencrypts the message, revealing the answer and id, and checks if they match.</li>
<li>it tells your server the result of the check.</li>

","<p>Your problem is caused because your public key is an <code>RSAPublicKey</code> object rather than a <code>SubjectPublicKeyInfo</code> object (see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/4739877/474189"">this answer</a> for a good description of the difference). You will need to convert from one to the other before your code will work.</p>

<p>BouncyCastle can do the conversion for you. The following code snippet will work, although I dislike it for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It uses a deprecated class <a href=""http://www.bouncycastle.org/docs/pkixdocs1.5on/org/bouncycastle/openssl/PEMReader.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>PEMReader</code></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>It requires the BouncyCastle provider to be loaded.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());    
PEMReader reader = new PEMReader(new StringReader(rsaPublicKeyString));    
BCRSAPublicKey key = (BCRSAPublicKey) reader.readObject();
bytes[] = key.getEncoded(); // now in SubjectPublicKeyInfo format.

// as before...
</code></pre>

<p>With BouncyCastle, there is always many ways to skin a cat. Perhaps someone can find a more elegant solution than the one above?</p>

","<p>A key contains arbitrary bytes. And those bytes don't necessarily represent valid UTF8 characters. So you shouldn't transform them to a String, because that is a lossy conversion. If you really need a String, then use Hex or Base64 encoding.</p>

<p>To make you realize what the error is, let's say that you use ASCII instead of UTF8. ASCII characters go from 0 to 127. All the other 128 byte values don't represent valid characters. So if the key contain any of those values, the transformation to a String loses them. It's basically the same thing with any encoding (except, IIRC, ISO8859-1).</p>

","<p>Do you mean the public key format used in a certificate? </p>

<p>Generally, a public key in a certificate is stored in the SubjectPublicKeyInfo field (cf. RFC 5280)</p>

<pre>
SubjectPublicKeyInfo  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
     algorithm            AlgorithmIdentifier,
     subjectPublicKey     BIT STRING  }
</pre>

<p>The specifics for DSA can be found in <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3370#section-3.1"" rel=""nofollow"">RFC 3370</a>. Usually the parameters of the AlgorithmIdentifier contain an instance of the Dss-Parms giving you p, k, g and the subjectPublicKey BIT STRING contains the public key y encoded as an DER-encoded INTEGER.</p>

<p>Concerning Base64: Strictly speaking certificates are <em>not</em> Base64-encoded but use an extended form of it, the PEM format, a plain text format which is the Base64 encoding of a X.509 certificate (RFC5280) enclosed between the lines </p>

<pre><code>""-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----"" 
...
""-----END CERTIFICATE-----"" 
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>""-----BEGIN X509 CERTIFICATE----"" 
...
""-----END X509 CERTIFICATE----"". 
</code></pre>

<p>The certificate itself is the DER encoding of the ASN.1 structure as described in RFC 5280. See <a href=""http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/languages/X.690-0207.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">X.690</a> for details of DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules).</p>

<p>Most certificates are stored either in PEM format or directly in their raw DER-encoded form.</p>

"13057948","Python: Paramiko authentication via public key ""not a valid RSA""","<p>I'm attempting to communicate between two Solaris servers via Paramiko.  I can't use my private key for security reasons so am attempting to use id_rsa.pub.  Originally I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>ssh.connect(hostname=host, username=user, key_filename=path-to-key)
</code></pre>

<p>...where ssh is an SSHClient object.  Eventually my googling led me to believe that connect really expects a private key, not public, so I tried the solution <a href=""http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576810-copy-files-over-ssh-using-paramiko/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.  The difference with this one is that it uses transport.auth_publickey to do the authentication, which I hoped would get me around any formatting hangups.  Here's the significant portion:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    ki = paramiko.RSAKey.from_private_key_file(filename=key_file)
except Exception, e:
    print 'Failed loading {0}.  {1}'.format(key_file, e)
    return
</code></pre>

<p>I've checked my key_file and it is definitely pointing at my id_rsa.pub file, which is in OpenSSH format (I think; it starts with ssh-rsa and ends with user@host).  Still, I consistently hit the exception above, with e being, ""not a valid RSA private key file"".  Looking into the code, the closest error I can find to this is in the decoding step from BER.  I don't really know anything about BER or OpenSSH, but google seems to think they're the same thing, or at least compatible.</p>

<p>There are plenty of answers to similar questions here, but nothing that indicates why my solution doesn't work.  I'm not reading some strange format, I'm not confusing the key file with the key itself, etc.</p>

<p>Anyone have success using id_rsa.pub or an equivalent with Paramiko?  Preferably on  *nix.  I'm also open to, ""Hey, idiot!  Why are you using Paramiko when there's something so much easier!""  ...so long as the criticism is constructive.</p>
","<p>You can't use the <strong>public key</strong> when connecting to the server, you have to supply the <strong>private key</strong>, that's how public/private key authentication works! The example you link to also reads the <strong>private key</strong> and uses it to connect.</p>

<p>You could generate a keypair that you only use for paramiko, that way you don't need to expose  the private key you use for e.g. ssh etc. </p>

<p>I really don't know why this has happened. I save the Base64 string generated for both private and public key in a SQLite database. Then I retrieve the Base64 string from the database, decode it and try to get the public key. But it doesn't work. Can anyone help me to understand the reason for this exception? When i tried the first time, I passed the generated Base64 string straight to the function to decode it, only to try, and it worked. But if I saved it in the database and then get it to decode, it doesn't work anymore. </p>

<p>Please help me.</p>

byte[] exponentByte = Base64.decode(exponent,Base64.DEFAULT);

<p>Above piece of code works perfectly on iPhone and I have tested that. I am able to securely communicate with my server. But when I try to run my app on iPad (in 2x mode) the above code getting crashed. After debug, I found out that secTrustCreateWithCertificate is crashing and the crash log is given below.. Certificate I used is same for both iPad and iPhone...The function above secCertificateCreateWithData returning a certificate reference and is not nil...So that is not the cause of crash..What am  I doing wrong.</p>

<pre><code>*** -[NSCFType count]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x14af24
*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '***      -[NSCFType count]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x14af24'
</code></pre>
","<p>The documentation for <code>SecTrustCreateWithCertificates</code> claims that you can pass either a single certificate OR an array.  The exception you're receiving states that <code>-[NSCFType count]: unrecognized selector sent to instance</code>.  What's happening in iOS 3.2 is that <code>SecTrustCreateWithCertificates</code> is treating the input value like a CFArray without checking first to see if it's a singular <code>SecCertificateRef</code>.  </p>

<p>To get around this, you can do something similar to the following code:</p>

<pre><code>    SecCertificateRef certs[1] = { certificate };
    CFArrayRef array = CFArrayCreate(NULL, (const void **) certs, 1, NULL);
    if(SecTrustCreateWithCertificates(array, x509Policy, &amp;trustChain) == errSecSuccess)
</code></pre>

<p>just remember to <code>CFRelease(array)</code> at the appropriate scope.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The server asks for the public key of the client</p></li>
<li><p>The public key is passed to <code>PublickeyAuthenticator#authenticate</code></p></li>
<li><p>All you are supposed to do in <code>authenticate()</code> is check that this is a public key that you want to allow</p></li>
<li><p>If <code>authenticate()</code> returns true, then <code>UserAuthPublicKey#auth</code> will check that a message has been signed with the private key. If it has then authentication has been validated.</p></li>

","<p>The below code is an example of how to perform Public Key Authentication using Apache MINA SSHD, the example code creates a SFTP server.</p>

<pre><code>import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Collections;

@Service
public class MySftpServer {

    private Log log = LogFactory.getLog(MySftpServer.class);

    @PostConstruct
    public void startServer() throws IOException {
        start();
    }

    private void start() throws IOException {
        SshServer sshd = SshServer.setUpDefaultServer();
        sshd.setHost(""localhost"");
        sshd.setPort(2222);
        sshd.setKeyPairProvider(new SimpleGeneratorHostKeyProvider(new File(""host.ser"")));
        sshd.setSubsystemFactories(Collections.singletonList(new SftpSubsystemFactory()));
        sshd.setPasswordAuthenticator((username, password, session) -&gt; username.equals(""test"") &amp;&amp; password.equals(""password""));
        sshd.setPublickeyAuthenticator(new AuthorizedKeysAuthenticator(new File(""&lt;Location of authorized_keys file&gt;"")));
        sshd.start();
        log.info(""SFTP server started"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Similar to what @northshorefiend mentioned in his answer, in this case <code>AuthorizedKeysAuthenticator</code> takes the public key passed to the server and validates it against the authorized_keys file <code>new AuthorizedKeysAuthenticator(new File(""&lt;Location of authorized_keys file&gt;"")</code> . If the specified public key exists in the file, then it passes the authentication.</p>

","<p>Anything you do in Javascript can be seen and analyzed, as it's happening on the client side. So encrypting information securely client side is pretty much impossible. That leaves the server as the only point where you can and need to do validation.</p>

<p>Also, why would you care if an input comes from your script or is hand-crafted by a user? If the input is valid and allowed as defined by your rules, it shouldn't make any difference.</p>

<hr>

<p>For this kind of situation, when in doubt, you need to see the importance of client/server separation. Your server is your app, it's the one and only critical component that you need to take care of. Every input is generally untrusted, every output must be exactly what you intend to disclose.</p>

<p>The HTML/JS interface you're handing to the user is just a help for the human to communicate with your server, but that doesn't mean it's trustworthy or securable once it has left your server.</p>

","<p>The other answers are correct: this is fundamentally impossible.

","<p>What users and paths are involved?  In the standard openssh setup, the $HOME/.ssh directory of the remote user (the one into which ssh is logging in) is the right location for the authorized_keys file.  However, it is also possible to have the files located elsewhere.</p>

<p>Also, check the file ownership.  The authorized_keys file must be owned by the user logging in.</p>

<p>A check of /var/log/messages or /var/log/secure (""ls -ltr /var/log"" after a failed attempt may help figure out the right log file) may give specifics.</p>

<p>If all else fails, you could strace the sshd process(es) to see exactly which files they are reading.  Not trivial to do, but it does get right to the guts of the operation of the server.</p>

<p>How do I fix this problem? I have been trying to work it out for so long but now am just totally stuck.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!</p>
","<ol>
<li>You must to know two things: private key can be created is putty and openssh-compatible formats - and these formats are not freely exchangeable (client-side tool can understand putty <strong>or</strong> openssh only), Linux understand only openssh-type keys</li>
<li>You must use on client-side (additional) tool, which provide non-interactive authentication by key on request</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>A consequence of points 1 and 2</strong></p>

<p><strong>Windows-client</strong>: run pageant, load putty's private key into it (enter passphrase for key). <em>Maybe</em> you have to redefine in Git ssh-client from system to plink</p>

<p><strong>Linux-client</strong>: on Windows-host load putty-type private key into puttygen and export into openssh-key. Save this file in Linux-box as <code>/.ssh/id_dsa</code>. Run ssh-agent, enter password once. ssh-agent will use password for key for all requests during session</p>

<p>Of course, you can change the Signature instance with another Algorithm. In my case I use <code>""SHA1WithRSA""</code>, but you get the point right? </p>

<p>With this, someone will encrypt their data using their private key, and send it to you. After that, you will verify the data using the public key they give.</p>

<p>In example, Bob send to you message about money amount he sent to you (<code>$5000</code>), and sign it using their private key, become encrypted. When the data arrived to you, you know Bob supposed to send $5000, then you verify the encrypted data with text <code>$5000</code> and public key Bob share, but is it really <code>$5000</code> OR <strong>does it comes from Bob?</strong></p>

<p>If the data has been changed, OR when someday you ask for some Money to Bob, but the message tapped by someone else and s/he send you the amount message with private key other than Bob's, you will know.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mik</li>
</ul>
","<p>Actually a decrypt of a signature should never fail unless you specified the wrong encoding parameters - a signature is simply the private-key encrypted hash of the data (typically SHA1); the only benefit of using the verify routine is that it decrypts the block and does the hash comparison work for you, if you wanted to be bloody minded you could instead do a decrypt operation with your public key and compare the hash bytes yourself.</p>

<p>I'm not actually sure what <code>response</code> is in the context of your program; you should <em>only</em> be passing the RSA data to it, if you're also feeding it the data that was signed in the first place you are <strong>doing it wrong</strong> - similarly, do check if that function actually accepts a string, in my experience BouncyCastle generally expects a <code>byte[]</code></p>

<p>I'd recommend using <code>SignerUtilities.GetSigner()</code> - it takes a string arg to tell it what sort of signature you're using, I would imagine <code>""SHA1WithRSA""</code> to be right for you.</p>

","<p>There's also the PyCrypto module that looks exactly like what you are looking for: <a href=""http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/</a> the API docs are here: <a href=""http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/apidoc/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/apidoc/</a> and some nice docs with basic examples of encrypting/decrypting here: <a href=""http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/doc/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/doc/</a>.</p>

<p>I'll confess I haven't used this module, but it seems like you would establish a session with a public key, then use that to encrypt/decrypt the channel with a Crypto.PublicKey object. Then do the usual activity of generating a session key, communicating that over whatever channel you have. Finally, switch the channel to a Crypto.Cipher object using the session key.</p>

<p>Also, be sure to be very, very careful about how you obtain the value for your session key if security is a real concern, particularly on multiuser or only partially trusted machine.</p>

","<p>To complete the answer of GregS, assuming that you use Java as a programming language:</p>

<ol>
<li>You should transform the Base64 encoding into binary. There are some Base64 decoders out there, e.g. <a href=""http://iharder.sourceforge.net/current/java/base64/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>, which appears to be ""public domain"", thus reusable at will. You could also implement it yourself; it is not hard. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> has the useful links for that.</li>
<li>Decode the binary blob using the <code>SubjectPublicKeyInfo</code> ASN.1 structure. This is not very easy (unless you master ASN.1) but existing code can be used for that. In particular, Java knows how to do that directly.</li>
</ol>

<p>Public key decoding in Java looks like this (assuming the binary blob is in variable <code>blob</code>):</p>

<pre><code>KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
KeySpec ks = new X509EncodedKeySpec(blob);
RSAPublicKey pk = (RSAPublicKey)kf.generatePublic(ks);
</code></pre>

<p>and from the <code>RSAPublicKey</code> instance, you have the <code>getModulus()</code> and <code>getPublicExponent()</code> methods which are self-explanatory. The relevant classes are in packages <code>java.security</code>, <code>java.security.interfaces</code> and <code>java.security.spec</code>. For your public key, this yields the following:</p>

<pre><code>modulus         = 102645155313298195029358862270152655993457886674545775623230610032728692959011417523892551564448476401788726191516935717690886291325065114613951136136194912439244754958152467056511740824446734443711392654194943771385565670988939260236433577393483222184597978937921816958725758100559250155638540637401770719799

","<p>The field of the elliptic curve is not over the field of real numbers. It's over a finite field modulo some prime. </p>

<p>For Secp256k1 the prime p = 2^256 - 2^32 - 2^9 - 2^8 - 2^7 - 2^6 - 2^4 - 1.</p>

<p>Thus: y^2= (x^3) + 7 (mod p)</p>

","<p>You need to calculate in the field <img src=""https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D_p"" alt=""Z_p"">, which mostly means that you have to reduce your number to the remainder after dividing with p after each calculation. Calculating this is called taking the modulo and is written as <code>% p</code> in python.</p>

<p>Exponentiating in this field can be done more effectively than the naive way of just multiplying and reducing many times. This is called modular exponentiation.  Python's built-in exponentation function pow(n,e,p) can take care of this.</p>

<p>The remaining problem is to find the square root. Luckily secp256k1 is chosen in a special way (<img src=""https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=p%5Cequiv3%5Cpmod+4"" alt=""p%4=3"">), so that taking square roots is easy: A square root of x is <img src=""https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=x%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7Bp%2B1%7D%7B4%7D%7D+%5Cpmod+p"" alt=""x^((p+1)/4)%p"">.</p>

<p>So a simplified version of your code becomes:</p>

<pre><code>import binascii

p_hex = 'FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEFFFFFC2F'
p = int(p_hex, 16)
compressed_key_hex = '0250863AD64A87AE8A2FE83C1AF1A8403CB53F53E486D8511DAD8A04887E5B2352'

prefix = compressed_key_hex[0:2]

y_square_square_root = pow(y_square, (p+1)/4, p)
if (prefix == ""02"" and y_square_square_root &amp; 1) or (prefix == ""03"" and not y_square_square_root &amp; 1):
    y = (-y_square_square_root) % p
else:
    y = y_square_square_root

computed_y_hex = format(y, '064x')
computed_uncompressed_key = ""04"" + x_hex + computed_y_hex

","<p>An elliptic curve point is not an integer. Putting the encoded representation of a point (G) in a <code>BigInteger</code> and trying to use it as an integer is nowhere near correct.

<blockquote>
  <p>since java 7, there are classes included in the java.security.* and java.security.spec.* packages to do this in short code</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. First, Java crypto isolates the classes you see in <code>java.security</code> and <code>javax.crypto</code> from the implementation code, which is in entirely different classes (mostly (still) under <code>sun.*</code> and <code>com.sun.*</code>) in one or more 'providers' which are separate jars and technically optional; it is possible to remove, add, or change providers without changing the calls in your code, although most people don't. The JCA 'facade' classes for EC crypto were present since java 5 (called 1.5), but no provider implementing EC algorithms was included in the standard build; to use them you had to add a third-party provider. Starting in java 7 a standard SunEC provider IS included. However, JCA (for all algorithms not just EC) keeps private and public keys strictly separate after generation, and in particular it provides no way to access the private-to-public derivation logic that exists internally for EC.</p>

<p>It does include the parameters for several standard curves, including secp256k1, which you could use to avoid the effort of copying them from the spec. There doesn't appear to be a direct way to access this data, but you can do so indirectly by generating a nonce key and discarding it. Alternatively, since you already have a private key you can create the encoding Java uses (PKCS8) and read that in, producing the same curve parameters and also a usable key. In general constructing ASN.1 DER encodings like PKCS8 is fairly complicated, but <em>for EC</em> it is simplified because (1) everybody uses the 'named' form which encodes the curve as a single OID and (2) the standard specifies an encoding of the private value which is fixed in length for a given curve; as a result the PKCS8 encoding for a given EC curve consists of a fixed prefix followed by the private key value. Example snippets:</p>

<pre><code>    KeyPairGenerator kg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance (""EC"");
    kg.initialize (new ECGenParameterSpec (""secp256k1""));
    ECParameterSpec p = ((ECPublicKey) kg.generateKeyPair().getPublic()).getParams();
    System.out.println (""p=(dec)"" + ((ECFieldFp) p.getCurve().getField()).getP() );
    ECPoint G = p.getGenerator(); 
    System.out.format (""Gx=(hex)%032x%n"", G.getAffineX());
    System.out.format (""Gy=(hex)%032x%n"", G.getAffineY());
    //
    byte[] privatekey_enc = DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary(
            ""303E020100301006072A8648CE3D020106052B8104000A042730250201010420""+

    // note fixed prefix for PKCS8-EC-secp256k1 plus your private value
    KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""EC"");
    PrivateKey k1 = kf.generatePrivate(new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(privatekey_enc));
    ECParameterSpec p2 = ((ECPrivateKey) k1).getParams();
    System.out.println (""again p=(dec)"" + ((ECFieldFp) p2.getCurve().getField()).getP() );

</code></pre>

<p>Note those coordinates for the basepoint G match your expectation. I displayed a mix of decimal and hex just to show the possibilities; this does not affect the actual numbers in the computer.</p>

<p>ADDED in response to comments:</p>

<p>The variables p and p2 are <code>ECParameterSpec</code> objects which contain the parameters of an EC curve (underlying field, curve coefficients, basepoint aka generator, order and cofactor; and internally 'name' although the API doesn't expose it). The values I print labelled 'p' are the result of calling <code>getP</code> which returns <em>one</em> item from the curve parameters, namely the modulus of the underlying prime field, and thus the value you need to use in the calculations shown in the linked post where it does <code>mod(p)</code> and <code>modInverse(p)</code> and <code>modPow(,p)</code>. Since this p (or P) is a parameter of the curve it is the same for all keys on that curve; note the two values I print are the same even though they are from different keys. There are actually two kinds of elliptic curves standardized for cryptography: curves over a prime field, denoted Fp, and curves over an extension field of characteristic two, denoted F2m. secp256k1 is the first kind, that's why the cast to <code>ECFieldFp</code> before calling <code>getP()</code>. </p>

<p>Yes my fixed prefix contains the headers and fields identifying a privatekey (PKCS8) encoding as being for EC and secp256k1 and that prefix is the same for all EC secp256k1 privatekeys. The p values are as described above, and not privatekeys or publickeys. Yes if you had the public point you could combine it with the <code>ECParameterSpec</code> into an <code>ECPublicKeySpec</code> and convert it and use it -- or you could append the point encoding to a similar but different fixed prefix to get an <code>X509EncodedKeySpec</code> which is the encoding Java uses for publickeys and convert <em>that</em> without needing the <code>ECParameterSpec</code> in advance -- but your whole problem, as I understand it, is that you don't have the public point yet and want to derive it, which requires the point multiplication calculation shown in the linked posts. </p>

<p>Public and private key are used to negotiate a symmetric encryption key, that will be used during that session. Asymmetric encryption uses two keys (private and public), symmetric encryption uses only one.</p>

<p>Your server sends its public key to a client, the client validates that key signature (check the CA and all that) then use it to encrypt a randomly selected key that will be used as symmetric encryption key, and send it to the server. Because only the private key can decrypt that message, the message is secure, only the server can decrypt it. Then the server accepts that key selected by the client, and they start to transmit data using symmetric encryption.</p>

<p>Why all this? asymmetric encryption is quite computionally expensive, so it is just used to ensure that client and server can negotiate a secure symmetric key without sending it in plain text. Symmetric encryption is cheap.</p>

<p>Symmetric encryption is also safe, the problem is that both parts must know the key before start, and that is a big issue. By using asymmetric encryption for negotiating the key, this problem is solved.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Well, it seems that @EJP does not agree with my answer, so I tried to find some more documentation that explain the thing in an easy way.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.techradar.com/news/software/how-ssl-and-tls-works-1047412"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.techradar.com/news/software/how-ssl-and-tls-works-1047412</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SSL explained</p>
  
  <p>When you visit a bank's website, the bank's server will automatically
  redirect you to its secure site using the HTTPS protocol before you
  can log in. This results in your browser and the bank's site
  negotiating a secure channel using SSL.</p>
  
  <p>This negotiation goes a little like this (note that I've simplified it
  greatly). The browser sends a message stating what the latest version
  of SSL it can support and a list of symmetric algorithms it can use.
  The web server sends back a message with the version of SSL and the
  algorithm that will be used.</p>
  
  <p>It sends its certificate as well. The client verifies the certificate
  using the known certificates that came with the browser; in other
  words, it checks that it has been signed by a trusted CA and that it
  hasn't expired.</p>
  
  <p>If the certificate is valid, the browser generates a one-time key for
  the session, encrypts it with the server's public key (it's part of
  the certificate), and sends it to the server. The server decrypts the
  key, then uses that key together with the agreed symmetric algorithm
  for the rest of the session.</p>

  <p>I assume the server will use client's public key to encrypt the response (by default? or upon configuration?).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. See below. In most SSL connections the server doesn't even know the client's public key,if indeed the client even has one. This only occurs in so-called 'mutual' SSL, Where both peers authenticate to each other.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If so, does the server knows the client's public key from the request it sends to the server, or somehow else?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It only knows the public key if the client sends its certificate, which only happens if the server is configured to request it, which it usually isn't.</p>

<p>HTTPS runs over SSL, which uses a symmetric session key negotiated independently by both peers. It is never transmitted. The server's key is only used to provide a digital signature over its certificate, which the client can verify, which proves that that server owns that certificate. From there on it is all symmetric negotiation and encryption.</p>

"23318485","Whose key is used to encrypt a HTTPS response?","<p>I have a web server built up relying on HTTPS. So, my server maintains its private key and publish a public key that any clients can use to encrypt their request. Since my server is the only one who has the private key to decrypt any message encryped using server's public key, any request sent this way can be considered secure.</p>

<p>However my question is at the response part. When the server sends the response back to the client, whose public key will the server use to encrypt the response message?</p>

<p>I assume the server will use client's public key to encrypt the response (by default? or upon configuration?). If so, does the server knows the client's public key from the request it sends to the server, or somehow else?</p>

<p><strong>Update:
If I understand it incorrectly, then during future communications how each party knows how to decrypt the message the other one sends? Is some key shared or somehow?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>Public keys are not directly used to encrypt any of the the underlying HTTP traffic on an HTTPS connection; neither the HTTP request nor the HTTP response are encrypted this way.  Rather, during the initial SSL handshake, a session specific symmetric key is negotiated between the client and the server, and it's the symmetric key that is then used to encrypt all traffic on the HTTP connection in both directions.</p>

<p>The specific mechanism by which the symmetric key is negotiated depends on the specific cipher suite that is negotiated between client and server.  This negotiation always involves the server's public key and a value sent by the client; it may also involve items like a client public key or separate connection specific public keys from the server and client.</p>

","<p>Bitbucket pipelines can use a Docker image you've created, that has the ssh client setup to run during your builds, as long as it's hosted on a publicly accessible container registry.</p>

<h3>Create a Docker image.</h3>

<p><a href=""https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/dockerimages/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Create a Docker image</a> with your ssh key available somewhere. The image also needs to have the <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/94275/22470"">host key for your environment(s) saved</a> under the user the container will run as. This is normally the <code>root</code> user but may be different if you have a <code>USER</code> command in your <code>Dockerfile</code>. </p>

<p>You could copy an already populated <code>known-hosts</code> file in or configure the file dynamically at image build time with:</p>

<pre><code>RUN ssh-keyscan your.staging-host.com
</code></pre>

<h3>Publish the image</h3>

<p>Publish your image to a publicly accessible, but <strong>private</strong> registry. You can <a href=""https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">host your own</a> or use a service like <a href=""https://hub.docker.com/billing-plans/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Docker Hub</a>.</p>

On the Java side, you're encrypting the UTF-8 encoded password, whereas on the .NET side, it's using <code>UnicodeEncoding</code> which is UTF-16. Try using UTF-16 on the Java side before encryption instead.</p>

"10970714","Adding Users to Gitolite, Permission Denied","<p>I have a Gitolite server running on EC2 that works pretty well. I've added users before and have no problem adding repositories.</p>

<p>My Macbook Pro can push code to a repository with no problem (it has the <code>RW+</code> permission on the repo). I've also added a second computer to the repository with <code>R</code> permissions so I can clone it.</p>

When I SSH into the server with Gitolite and look at the user ""git""'s authorized_keys file, I <em>do</em> see the public key of the second computer, so I'm not sure what the problem is-- it looks like it is getting added just fine.

","<p>The normal private key format for RSA includes the public key (the ""public exponent"" is useful for implementation of private key operations in a way which resists timing attacks). Therefore, it is possible to extract the public key from the private key.</p>

<p>(It is theoretically possible to have a ""pure RSA private key"" which does NOT include the public exponent, but it has drawbacks, such as much harder protection against side-channel attacks, and reduced performance. Therefore nobody in their right mind does that. You can assume that when you have the private key you actually have the complete key pair.)</p>

<p>In the C#/.NET standard library, public and private RSA keys can be represented as XML strings (<code>ToXmlString()</code> and <code>FromXmlString()</code>) or a custom <code>RSAParameters</code> structure (<code>ExportParameters()</code> and <code>ImportParameters()</code>). If you can obtain the complete private key then you just have to pick the public fields (modulus and public exponent), which constitute together the public key. Note that <code>RSACryptoServiceProvider</code> may be an interface to an underlying RSA implementation which could refuse to export the private key (but will usually accept to export the public key).</p>

","<p>Your main problem is that the <strong>XDR-style encoding</strong> used by SSH for publickey, which OpenSSH uses to compute the fingerprint, is not the same as the encoding used by Java crypto, which is an ASN.1 DER format defined by X.509 formally called <code>SubjectPublicKeyInfo</code>. In fact I'm very surprised you were able to read an OpenSSH <code>.pub</code> file in Java; there is no direct way to do so. See numerous existing Qs on this at <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46870569/ssh-keygen-and-openssl-gives-two-different-public-keys"">ssh-keygen and openssl gives two different public keys</a> (disclosure: mine) but on a quick check I don't think any of them are Java so you'll need to do something like:</p>

byte[] e = rsapubkey.getPublicExponent().toByteArray(); // and so is SSH
byte[] tag = ""ssh-rsa"".getBytes(); // charset very rarely matters here
ByteArrayOutputStream os = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
DataOutputStream do = new DataOutputStream(os);
do.writeInt(tag.length); do.write(tag);
do.writeInt(e.length); do.write(e);
do.writeInt(n.length); do.write(n);
byte[] encoded = os.toByteArray();
// now hash that (you don't really need Apache) 
// assuming SHA256-base64 (see below)
MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA256"");
byte[] result = digest.digest(encoded);
String output = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(result);
</code></pre>

<p>(Aside: Thanks linc01n for catching the bug -- I try to always compile before posting and I'm not sure how I missed this one.) </p>

<p>The second problem is that <strong>OpenSSH</strong> has never displayed SHA256 fingerprints in hex. It originally used <em>MD5</em> fingerprints in hex with colons; in 6.8 it switched by default to <strong>SHA256 in base64</strong> (using the traditional alphabet not the 'URLsafe' one preferred by JSON) although you can still get the older form (in <code>ssh</code> use <code>-oFingerprintHash=md5</code> or the equivalent config setting; in <code>ssh-keygen -l</code> use <code>-E md5</code>). Determine which one(s?) you want and code accordingly.</p>

<p>Or, if you have the <code>.pub</code> file, just read the second space-separated field of the one line, convert from base64 to <code>byte[]</code>, hash that, and display.</p>

<pre><code>byte[] publicKeyBytes = keyPair.getPublic().getEncoded();

<p>Here you're taking bytes of key and writing directly to file. So you get the appropriate result - DER-encoded file. However PEM is Base64 encoded format with line breaks each 64 symbols and header/footer.</p>

<p>There is code implementing this logic:</p>

<pre><code>String publicKeyContent = Base64.encode(publicKeyBytes);
String publicKeyFormatted = ""-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----"" + System.lineSeparator();
for (final String row: 
        Splitter
            .fixedLength(64)
            .split(publicKeyContent)
    ) 
{
    publicKeyFormatted += row + System.lineSeparator();
}
publicKeyFormatted += ""-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"";

"13795615","Keychain Assistant does not create public/private key pair, and my distribution certificates fail codesign verification","<p>My certificates were expiring today (and at this point, it's totally expired), so I set out to renew the certificates. But the problem is, I can't get matching private/public keys for proper code-signing verification with the renewed certificates.  All I've read says keychain will automatically create matching public/private keys, but it's not doing it for me.  I am totally stumped and I don't know what I can do at this point.  Please help.  Here's what I've done so far:</p>

<p>1)  I revoked the certificates from Apple Developer > iOS Provisioning Portal > Certificates > Developer and Distribution tabs.</p>

<p>2)  I launched Keychain Access.app from Applications > Utilities.</p>

<p>3)  I removed all outdated certificates, and eventually removed everything except for Apple Code Signing Certification Authority, Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority, Dashboard Advisory and Software Signing.  (By the way, I have no idea what this ""Software Signing"" certificate is for, but it won't be expiring until 2015, I'm reluctant to delete it without knowing what it would do to the system if I deleted it.)</p>

<p>4)  I generated CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest via Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority</p>

<p>5)  Got the CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest on desktop.  (At this point, I check the Keychain, and I still don't see my private or public keys.</p>

<p>6)  I submit the CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest at Apple Developer > iOS Provisioning Portal > Certificates > Developer and Distribution tabs.</p>

<p>7)  I download the certificates, install them to keychain, and it looks like my certificates are now renewed for another year.</p>

<p>8)  I renew all provisioning profiles.</p>

<p>9)  I retrieve them to my Xcode.</p>

<p>10)  I generate new distribution build, then I get the warning that ""Application failed codesign verification.  The signature was invalid, contains disallowed entitlements, or it was not signed with an iPhone Distribution Certificate.""</p>

<p>11)  I look at the Keychain again, and I don't see my private or public keys. </p>

<p>12)  Well, I exported p12 file a year ago.  So, okay, I start all over again (i.e., take the steps 1, 2 and 3.)  Then I import the p12 file.  Now I see my private key in my Keychain.</p>

<p>13)  I then resume with step 4 above (i.e., get the CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest via Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority)</p>

<p>14)  I continue on with steps 5 through 8.  Just to make sure, I reboot my machine again.  Then I check my Keychain, and public key is still missing, and taking steps 9 and 10 results exactly the same.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?  What should I do to fix this problem?  I'd so appreciate any and all help.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT:  I'm not entirely sure which steps I took actually ended up fixing this, but I got it working now. Main thing was, deleting everything from keychain and look for possible cause all over the web, and and I did read this thread too:</p>

<p><a href=""http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20060318124936642"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20060318124936642</a></p>

<p>And run these commands:</p>

<p>sudo systemkeychain -vfcC</p>

<p>systemkeychain -vt</p>

<p>I also continued to look for how to repair keychain, run disk utility, repairing any and all permission issues, etc.</p>

<p>And eventually, my keychain access app started working as expected again, and it finally generated both private and public keys.  Ahhhh.  Once it did that, everything else worked fine, doing the steps I took earlier.</p>

","<p>You will need to stop the instance (if EBS-backed instance) in order to change the key pair to be used for the instance.  If not EBS-backed volume you will just need to start another instance from your AMI with the the new key pair.</p>

<p>If you are not able to easily restart the instance or create a new instance, there is this method which purports to being able to change public keys on a running instance, but I haven;t tried it. Really the right way to do it is by stopping/starting or creating new instances.</p>

This solution works. I checked it. 
In simple steps.
login to AWS console, create a new pem key, it will ask you to save it to local, save it.
run the following command.</p>

<p>ssh-keygen -y | tee my_key.pub 
type the path to where you have saved the new pem key file along with the file name.</p>

<p>the above command will display the contents on the screen, copy it, and paste into the 
authorized_keys file of the EC2 instance, save and close. 
now you can use the saved/downloaded new pem key file to access the EC2 instance.</p>

  <p><code>&lt;some_md5_fingerprint&gt;</code></p>
  
  <p>[] Always allow from this computer</p>
  
  <p>CANCEL OK</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although I was quite sure it was my machine trying to connect, I asked myself how I would confirm that.</p>

<p>This sprang two more <strong>concrete questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Where is the RSA public key?</li>
<li>How do I get the MD5 fingerprint for an RSA public key?</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, I wanted a widely usable answer so the solution should be available to every Windows (win7 in my case) user without requiring installation of software.</p>
","<p>I'm using <code>cmd</code> and its <code>for</code> loop as well as <code>certUtil</code> which should all come pre-installed.</p>

<p>Open <code>cmd</code> by</p>

<ul>
<li>pressing <kbd><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/T0oPO.png"" alt=""Windows Key""></kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> and typing <code>cmd</code> then confirming, or</li>
<li>opening Windows' Start menu, searching for <code>cmd.exe</code> and executing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong></p>

<pre><code>for /F ""tokens=2"" %a in (id_rsa.pub) DO (echo %a) &gt; tmp.key_base64
certUtil -decode tmp.key_base64 tmp.key_bytes
certUtil -hashfile tmp.key_bytes MD5
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Where is the RSA public key?</strong></p>

<p>Usually the keys are kept in the directory <code>.ssh</code> under the user's home.</p>

<p>(Android Studio stores different(!) keys, <code>adbkey.pub</code>, in the directory <code>.android</code> under the user's home and in its installation directory, here <code>C:\Android\.android</code> - both keys were issued to the phone during the process mentioned in the preamble above.)</p>

<p>After opening the console you should already be in your home directory and only need to change into <code>.ssh</code></p>

<pre><code>C:\Users\%USERNAME%&gt;cd .ssh
</code></pre>

<p>In case you're not in your home directory type</p>

<pre><code>cd \Users\%USERNAME%\.ssh
</code></pre>

<p>and execute.</p>

<p>(For Android Studio change directory to <code>\Users\%USERNAME%\.android</code> or <code>\Android\.android</code> respectively.)</p>

<p><strong>How do I get the MD5 fingerprint for an RSA public key?</strong></p>

<p>For this I needed to know that the actual key in the file is the base64-encoded part, i.e. the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#Examples"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">long cryptic string of characters</a>. In my cases the <em>key field</em> was always followed by a <em>user-host field</em>, i.e. a string like <code>user@domain.com</code> (also <code>unknown@unknown</code>) and in some cases preceded by a field containing <code>ssh-rsa</code>.</p>

<p>In those latter cases I needed to filter the second field. In windows, apparently, this is done using a <code>for</code> loop. I also send the output to a file for subsequential digestion by <code>certUtil</code>, its output again brought into a file - containing the key no longer base64-encoded but in bytes - which is finally hashed using MD5.</p>

<p>Extracting the key which is in the second field of my <code>id_rsa.pub</code> to a file named <code>tmp.key_base64</code>:</p>

<pre><code>for /F ""tokens=2"" %a in (id_rsa.pub) DO (echo %a) &gt; tmp.key_base64
</code></pre>

<p>(First field for Android Studio's <code>adbkey.pub</code>: <code>""tokens=1""</code>)</p>

<p>Base64-decoding to receive the actual public key in file <code>tmp.key_bytes</code>:</p>

<pre><code>certUtil -decode tmp.key_base64 tmp.key_bytes
</code></pre>

<p>Hash the key using MD5:</p>

<pre><code>certUtil -hashfile tmp.key_bytes MD5

","<p>Looks like key wrapping (encryption) to me. Use bouncy castle to read the PEM file, then use <code>Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding"")</code> to encrypt the secret key, and base 64 encode the result... You could also try the mode <code>Cipher.WRAP_MODE</code> to see if that works. Note that encryption will always return a different result, the only way to test for compatibility is to decrypt it with the other software.</p>

<p>How can I get this fingerprint from public key?</p>
","<p>Generally, running <code>gpg --list-keys --with-fingerprint --with-colons</code> piping in the key will yield information on the key. You will get an easily parseable result like</p>

<pre><code>pub:-:2048:1:FEFD88729C9BDD27:2015-09-27:::-:mytest &lt;aa@aa.aa&gt;:
fpr:::::::::96E9C3DC001C10B3AE6236B1FEFD88729C9BDD27:
sub:-:2048:1:22EC13225E681EFA:2015-09-27::::
</code></pre>

<p>The fingerprint is at a fixed column in the second line of the colon-separated output.</p>

<p>But when you're importing the key anyway, have a look at the output given by the code in your question, which already contains the fingerprint in <code>$info</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Array
(
    [imported] =&gt; 1
    [unchanged] =&gt; 0
    [newuserids] =&gt; 0
    [newsubkeys] =&gt; 0
    [secretimported] =&gt; 0
    [secretunchanged] =&gt; 0
    [newsignatures] =&gt; 0
    [skippedkeys] =&gt; 0
    [fingerprint] =&gt; 96E9C3DC001C10B3AE6236B1FEFD88729C9BDD27
)
</code></pre>

<p>Importing a key anyway to receive it's fingerprint is a viable way probably not too expensive, you might even be able to somehow cache the fingerprints for the hashed keys. Calculating the fingerprint on your own is something possible, but would require writing your own OpenPGP parser code which is probably not something you want to do.</p>

<p><strong>Edit01</strong></p>

<p>I've tried this with <a href=""http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/"" rel=""nofollow"">jsch</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/hierynomus/sshj"" rel=""nofollow"">sshj</a> and all of them fail to connect. There has to be something wrong with the above code for private key extraction. What baffles me is that I can connect with <code>ssh -i</code>. Also, if I load the above private key into putty-gen, I get the same authorized_keys string as in output from my program (already present in my remote machine's <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code>). But if I save it as a ppk file and then try to establish a putty session with it, it doesn't go through either (server refused our key).</p>
","<p><strong>There's noting wrong with the code I posted.</strong> It was just a huge fail on my part. </p>

<p>I used the keystore alias name as a username which <em>did not exist as a user account</em> on the remote linux box. After creating the account, everything works. I was editing the wrong <code>authorized_keys</code> file (on some other account) and expecting it to work through some obscure dark magic known only to leprechauns, unicorns and apparently my brain.</p>

<p>As for why it worked when I did <code>ssh -i</code>... Defaults. Stupid defaults. I did not specify a username at all so it defaulted to the one Cygwin was currently using and it just so happened that it had the same name as the account on the remote where I was editing the <code>authorized_keys</code> file.</p>

<p>Great. Awesome. Just..perfect. I need to go find a bridge to throw myself off from now.</p>

<p>Doing what I do in my code works with ganymed, jsch and sshj (with some small modifications for the other two APIs).</p>

"1999234","Ruby net-ssh: How to authenticate with pubkey using a gateway","<p>I am trying to run a script in several machines I have at work, to gather some information about them, such as which OS they're running, what services run on them, some configurations, etc. I have a machine on which I log before ssh-ing to any of the other machines, because of the public key setup it has. From there, I can ssh into all of the other machines without being asked for my password.</p>

<p>What I want to do is to automate logging onto all of these machines from that one, but the script is running on my local machine. So I just learned about ruby-ssh-gateway and am trying that, but I can't seem to get pubkey authentication to work.</p>

<p>I do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>gateway = Net::SSH::Gateway.new('gatewaymachine', 'username', :password =&gt; 'password')
all_machines.each do |machine|
  gateway.ssh(machine, 'username') do |ssh|
    uname = ssh.exec!('uname -a')
    puts ""machine: #{machine}; OS: #{uname}""
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>But I get a <code>Net::SSH::AuthenticationFailed</code> exception.</p>

<p>If, instead, I provide the password, like so:</p>

<pre><code>gateway.ssh(machine, 'username', :password =&gt; 'password')
</code></pre>

<p>it does work, but that's not viable, since passwords are not the same across machines.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how I can make this work?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>Are the machines you are talking to behind a NAT firewall?  If not, you don't need ruby-ssh-gateway.</p>

<p>Have you created a public key on the origin box, for the user which runs the program, and given that key to the target user on each target box?</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -t dsa    # Only do this once
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub user@machine
(enter the password)
</code></pre>

<p>and to make sure the key is working:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh user@machine      # should not ask for a password
</code></pre>

<p>Once you've done that, it's as simple as using system or backtick to shell out to ssh:</p>

<p>So what I'm needing here is the key value of keyPair.Public as a byte[].</p>

<p>I hope you understand where I'm heading and can help me.</p>
","<p>If you have only an ECPublicKeyParameter 'pub' (i.e. from keyPair.Public), you can get the public point encoding:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] data = pub.Q.GetEncoded();
</code></pre>

<p>At the receiving end:</p>

<pre><code>ECCurve curve = ecDomPars.Curve;
ECPoint q = curve.DecodePoint(data);
ECPublicKeyParameter peerPub = new ECPublicKeyParameter(q, ecDomPars);
</code></pre>

<p>It's more typical to exchange certificates, or else you will have no assurance of whom you're ""agreeing"" with.</p>

<p>I'm a bit concerned that you might be ""rolling your own crypto protocol""; if this is for a real application, please consider using an existing protocol, maybe just TLS. </p>

"34324466","Crypto API RSA public key can decrypt data, is not asymmetric as expected","<p>The problem I am encountering is that I am able to decrypt data using the same RSA 2048-bit public key that was used to encrypt the data. It seems to me that this defeats the entire purpose of encrypting the data in the first place, if a public key can decrypt it. The only thing I can consider at this time is that I'm generating symmetric key exchange pairs when I think I'm generating asymmetric pairs.</p>

<p>The end-user purpose of this is to use it later for transmitting user credentials to be authenticated when using an application away from the office, when I am unable to use their cached credentials from their workstations on the domain. I would theoretically be able to then decrypt these credentials using <strong>only</strong> the private key. </p>

<p>I have produced a simple test class and code to reproduce my problem. The steps I'm taking are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Acquire a context to Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0</li>
<li>Generate a public / private key pair.</li>
<li>Export the public and private key BLOBs to separate files.</li>
<li>Load up the public key and encrypt some simple text.</li>
<li>Attempt to decrypt the same encrypted text using the public key (I expected it to fail here except for when I'm using the private key - yet both work).</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately I don't get the opportunity to work with C++ very often so you may notice some problems. Feel free to constructively criticize.</p>

<p>Does anyone know why I am able to decrypt data using the same public key?
My goal is to be able to irreversibly encrypt something on the client side where it can only be decrypted on the server, where the private key will hide. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
I had considered that the hKey wasn't being destroyed properly by the ImportKey method, so I wrote this test case instead (same results - public key can encrypt and decrypt the data):</p>

","<p>The problem is that for some reason Crypto API, using the Microsoft Enhanced Provider w/ RSA, produces symmetrical keys. I am unable to get it to produce asymmetrical keys. The algorithm will, however, work with asymmetrical keys. So this is good news for us. This means to get this to work we only have to generate keys. You could also export these from self signed certificates, use your companies CA, etc.</p>

<p>To solve this I produced a public/private key pair using OpenSSL. I compiled OpenSSL for Windows just for fun then ran the following statements to get myself a pair of unencrypted public/private key files:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>openssl genpkey -out private2.pem -outform PEM -des3 -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048</p></li>
<li><p>openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem</p></li>
<li>openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -out private_unencrypted.pem</li>
</ol>

<p>Once I had those I added 2 new functions to my test helper class, ImportPublicKey and ImportPrivateKey. These will only import PEM files without a passphrase. I don't consider that much of a security threat, considering the public is public and the private should hide on a secure server somewhere, perhaps encoded with a hash.</p>

"34324466","Crypto API RSA public key can decrypt data, is not asymmetric as expected","<p>The problem I am encountering is that I am able to decrypt data using the same RSA 2048-bit public key that was used to encrypt the data. It seems to me that this defeats the entire purpose of encrypting the data in the first place, if a public key can decrypt it. The only thing I can consider at this time is that I'm generating symmetric key exchange pairs when I think I'm generating asymmetric pairs.</p>

<p>The end-user purpose of this is to use it later for transmitting user credentials to be authenticated when using an application away from the office, when I am unable to use their cached credentials from their workstations on the domain. I would theoretically be able to then decrypt these credentials using <strong>only</strong> the private key. </p>

<p>I have produced a simple test class and code to reproduce my problem. The steps I'm taking are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Acquire a context to Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0</li>
<li>Generate a public / private key pair.</li>
<li>Export the public and private key BLOBs to separate files.</li>
<li>Load up the public key and encrypt some simple text.</li>
<li>Attempt to decrypt the same encrypted text using the public key (I expected it to fail here except for when I'm using the private key - yet both work).</li>

<p>Unfortunately I don't get the opportunity to work with C++ very often so you may notice some problems. Feel free to constructively criticize.</p>

<p>Does anyone know why I am able to decrypt data using the same public key?
My goal is to be able to irreversibly encrypt something on the client side where it can only be decrypted on the server, where the private key will hide. </p>

I had considered that the hKey wasn't being destroyed properly by the ImportKey method, so I wrote this test case instead (same results - public key can encrypt and decrypt the data):</p>

<p>After some fighting with the same problem I realized where the error was.</p>

<p>In your first code you were acquiring your context with the last flag set to zero:</p>

<pre><code>CryptAcquireContext(&amp;hProvider, NULL, pszProvider, dwProvType, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>But in your solution you changed it into CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT.</p>

<pre><code>CryptAcquireContext(&amp;hProvider, NULL, NULL, PROV_RSA_FULL, CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT);
</code></pre>

<p>You solved your problem by changing this flag, not by importing the keys from OpenSSL. I am pretty sure that if you test this in your initial code, it will work as expected.</p>

<p>This CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT flag is responsible for not allowing a key to achieve persistence in the system, a persistence which turned the public RSA able to encrypt and decrypt.</p>

","<p>ASCII-armored and PEM are very similar. You just need to change the BEGIN/END markers, strip the PGP headers and checksums (the checksum is the last line <code>=Zqph</code>), and add the PEM header. So, you have to change the <code>inaimathi.pubkey</code> to this file:</p>

","<p>The very first notion of signing <em>anything</em> in Git was referenced in <a href=""https://github.com/git/git/commit/ec4465adb38d21966acdc9510ff15c0fe4539468"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">commit ec4465a, Git v0.99, Apr. 2005</a> (pretty much from the very beginning)</p>

 **/
</code></pre>

<p>So your question has legs.</p>

<p>The very first signed commit used gpg, but could have used anything else (<a href=""https://github.com/git/git/commit/65f0d0ee4627dd0f0468ceded38677076d78feb5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">commit 65f0d0e</a>):</p>

gpg -bsa .tmp-tag &amp;&amp; cat .tmp-tag.asc &gt;&gt; .tmp-tag

</code></pre>

<p>Technically, you can use <a href=""https://superuser.com/a/390176/141"">gpg in place of ssh</a>. I haven't seen often the reverse though.<br>
But you can use <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/a/66482"">an ssh key-pair be used with PGP/GPG</a>.<br>
That means the first validation script might still work (<a href=""https://github.com/git/git/commit/f336e71f86560df3503c1da1f68635a184af28a9"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">commit f336e71</a>)... except it expected a PGP comment:</p>

<p>So, ""Why does git sign with GPG keys rather than using SSH keys?"": it is what GPG is meant to do, as opposed to SSH, <a href=""https://superuser.com/a/308130/141"">which cannot do with openssh alone (it needs openssl)</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45119932/why-does-git-sign-with-gpg-keys-rather-than-using-ssh-keys/45120525#comment77216257_45119932"">As commented</a> by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/1256452/torek"">torek</a>, using SSH would be theoretically possible, it's just not convenient. </p>

<p>You can create a git repo and never have it leave your local disk.

<p>My server implementation is as follows,</p>

sshd = SshServer.setUpDefaultServer();


sshd.setPort(2222);
//sshd.setPort(config.getSFTPPort());

//sshd.setKeyPairProvider(new 
sshd.setKeyPairProvider(new PEMGeneratorHostKeyProvider(""hostkey.pem""));

<p>However when I try to get a file using my SFTP client everything works. I would expect the authenticate method to fail given that it always returns false. I have tried setting the KeyPairProvider to use both the  PEMGeneratorHostKeyProvider and the SimpleGeneratorHostKeyProvider. I have also set the PublicKeyAuthenticator to use my SimpleKeyAuthenticator class.  Note, when I look at the console output I never see 'In authenticate' so I know that Authenticate is never being called. Could someone please point me to what I have missed?

","<p>At the server, both the public key and its certificate go into the KeyStore, along with the original private key, all under the same alias.</p>

<p>If the certificate is self-signed, you'll need to export it from there into the client's truststore.</p>

<p>You don't need to write code for this. Just set the system properties:</p>

javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword
javax.net.ssl.trustStore

"32433832","configuring SSLContext using existing SSL key/certificate pair in java (JSSE API)","<p>I am working on a java-project where I should implement the SSL-protokol on the server-side. Well, this is the first time I will use SSL in my application, so I read a lot about ssl/tls and now I want to implement something in java. I will implement this process using JSSE API:</p>

<p>1) client will connect to me</p>

<p>2) I will make authentification with my pubic key certificate. I means that I will send the client a public key and its corresponding certificate</p>

<p>3) the client encrypt the secret-key using my public key and RSA-algorithm and send it to me</p>

<p>I have already the private key and certificate saved on a keystore on my computer. So I am hesited how to access them from <strong>my java-application</strong>. I do not know, which are the steps to do to acess them, since it is the first time i am dealing with this kind of stuff</p>

<p>I will use an <strong>SSLEngine</strong>. So I should firstly <strong>initialize</strong> an <strong>SSLContext</strong> using this code:</p>

<pre><code>// First initialize the key and trust material.
    KeyStore ksKeys = KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS"");
    ksKeys.load(new FileInputStream(""/.../myKey""), passphrase);
    KeyStore ksTrust = KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS"");
    ksTrust.load(new FileInputStream(""/../myCertificate""), passphrase);

    sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance(""TLS"");
    sslContext.init( kmf.getKeyManagers(), tmf.getTrustManagers(), null);
    // We're ready for the engine.
    SSLEngine engine = sslContext.createSSLengine(hostname, port);

    // Use as client
    engine.setUseClientMode(true);
</code></pre>

<p>I am really new in the crypthography and  this is the first time I programming this stuff. Any Idea?</p>
","<p>After being confused, I did a lot of research and I could find the solution. First of all, I will describe the situation then I will give the steps to solve the problem. Like I said in my Post, I had the private key (.key-file)  and the certificate (.cer file) and I need to use them in my java-application (server using ssl-protocol). So the <strong>first step</strong> to do is to create a keystore named.jks-file containing the certificate/key so that I can be able to use them for your java-based-server. To do this step I used the steps described in this link <a href=""http://blog.jgc.org/2011/06/importing-existing-ssl-keycertificate.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jgc.org/2011/06/importing-existing-ssl-keycertificate.html</a></p>

<p>Now, how can I use my.jks-file in the above posted code?</p>

<p>Well this is a piece of code how to initialize your SSLEngine:</p>

<pre><code>char [] keyphrase=""xxx"".toCharArray();
char [] passphrase= ""yyy"".toCharArray();

// First initialize the key and trust material.
KeyStore ksKeys = KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS"");
InputStream readStream = new FileInputStream(new File(""/.../file.jks""));
ks.load(readStream, passphrase );
// create an factory for key-managers
KeyManagerFactory   =KeyManagerFactory.getInstance(KeyManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
kmf.init(ks, keyphrase);
SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance(""TLS"");
//initialize the ssl-context
sslContext.init(kmf.getKeyManagers(),null,null);
// We're ready for the engine.
SSLEngine engine = sslContext.createSSLEngine(host, port);
// Use as client
engine.setUseClientMode(true);

From the comment right before the above :) and it works on my system to give you a textual public key:</p>

$res=openssl_pkey_new();

// Get private key
openssl_pkey_export($res, $privkey);

According to GoDaddy:
To install a digital certificate, you must first generate and submit a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to the Certification Authority (CA). The CSR contains your certificate-application information, including your public key. Use your Web server software to generate the CSR, which will also create your public/private key pair used for encrypting and decrypting secure transactions.</p>

<h1>Repairing OSX directory permissions</h1>

<p>@AlexanderSupertramp, I said the permissions should be <code>744</code> <strong>'at most,'</strong> yes, referring to the requirements for SSH only. But I did not suggest that you should chmod the <code>/home</code> directory to that number. Each operating system has its own requirements for directory permissions, and I could only provide generic instructions since you didn't provide much information about your system. In any case, I am terribly sorry that my answer was not clear.</p>

<p>It is possible that your mac is failing to boot because <code>744</code> is too liberal. But I cannot be sure.  To resolve this you may want to pay a visit to the Genius Bar at an Apple Store or contact an authorized repair technician. You may also be able to fix the directory permissions automatically using built-in tools as follow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Boot into single-user mode by pressing <code>Command+S</code> at the same time as the power button to turn on your mac, as explained in <a href=""http://www.cultofmac.com/240390/use-single-user-mode-to-solve-wonky-mac-os-x-issues-os-x-tips/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a>.</li>
<li>Launch the OSX Disk Utility from the menu bar, and then use the repair permissions tool as described in this <a href=""http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1452"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Apple KB</a></li>

<p>So I checked other answers, maybe I should create a new instance and mount this one to add public keys. Is this the only way to solve the problem? </p>

<p>Thanks for help.</p>
","<p>Not sure if you got it sorted or not but permissions on your private key may give that error without any further specification. I´m aware that you in this specific case probably didn´t change the file permissions though.</p>

<p>However, if thats the case, just <code>sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/your_private_key</code>
Especially putty in windows enviroments seems to just deny access, linux usually tells you to change the permission.   </p>

<p>Using this, i am able to generate an encrypted text but the PHP server is not able to decrypt my encrypted text.</p>

<p>Server is working correctly as i am able to the whole exercise using a python script but it is not working for android.</p>

<p>Any idea what i might be doing wrong.. all help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Some other pointer:</p>

<ol>
<li>I get the public key as a string from the server and it can be changed at any time so cant save it in a cert file.</li>
<li>I am using android.util.Base64 class for encoding.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let me know if you need any other information.</p>

  <p>How to generate public and private keys usable for both C and Java?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generating the key pairs and representing them in memory is different than consuming them in Java or another framework/library, like OpenSSL.</p>

<p>Representing keys in memory is framework/library specific.</p>

<p>Encoding the keys so different frameworks/libraries can consume them is the trick.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>However when I try to use the keys in Java the program chokes, saying the key format is wrong. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Java, its usually enough to call <code>getBytes()</code> on the key. The key will be provided in a natural representation. For example calling it on a RSA public key will result in an ASN.1 encoding from PKCS 1.</p>

<p>Other formats you can consider for interoperability are PKCS8 for private keys and PKCS12.</p>

<p>There's also PEM, but its an older format. PEM is OK for public keys, but you should use PKCS8 or PKCS12 for private keys.</p>

<hr>

<p>The private you generated with OpenSSL is probably in encrypted PEM format (you should state the encoding you are using for them).

","<p>I was finally able to make this work.</p>

<p>The starting point was: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/alejacma/archive/2008/01/28/how-to-generate-key-pairs-encrypt-and-decrypt-data-with-cryptoapi.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/alejacma/archive/2008/01/28/how-to-generate-key-pairs-encrypt-and-decrypt-data-with-cryptoapi.aspx</a></p>

<p>Issues encountered</p>

<p>1)  Microsoft public and private keys used by CryptoAPI use a proprietary binary format (generally referred to as PUBLICKEYBLOB and PRIVATEKEYBLOB) that cannot be used by Java. Conversion of keys is required;</p>

<p>2)  The Crypto API encrypts in little-endian binary format while Java reads bytes in big-endian format. Ref: <a href=""http://www.jensign.com/JavaScience/dotnet/RSAEncrypt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jensign.com/JavaScience/dotnet/RSAEncrypt/</a>  and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness</a>
Binary conversion is required;</p>

<p>3)  The Microsoft CryptoAPI pads the message when it encrypts it. This means to decrypt in Java, the exact implementation of the RSA algorithm is required which takes into consideration the padding scheme used.</p>

<p>On the Java decrypt side, I used Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/NONE/PKCS1Padding"");</p>

<p>Hope this is helpful to someone.</p>

"42285185","SSH Public Key Authentication with Libssh2 C++","<p>I am working on a project where I am doing port forwarding to MySQL using libssh2 in C++. I've got it working for username/password authentication but I now want do it using public/private key authentication. The documentation for libssh2 is pretty poor so I am having difficult working out what I need to do. </p>

<p>What I am trying to do is have an Android app post data to my C++ app, where C++ will be given the SSH details along with the auth key and it creates the SSH tunnel. C++ is getting the key fine and then I am doing the following to do the public key authentication. </p>

<pre><code>else if (this-&gt;getAuthMethod() == SupportedAuthMethods::AUTH_PUBLICKEY)
    {

        string test = this-&gt;getSSHPrivateKey();

        boost::replace_all(test, ""\n"", """");

        unsigned char * key = (unsigned char *)test.c_str();

        size_t sizeofkey = strlen((char*)key);
        cout &lt;&lt; key &lt;&lt; endl;
        stringstream logstream;
        logstream &lt;&lt; ""Using public key authentication for SSH Host: "" &lt;&lt; this-&gt;getSSHHostnameOrIPAddress();
        this-&gt;bitsLibrary-&gt;writeToLog(logstream.str(), ""SSHTunnelForwarder"", ""authenticateSSHServer"");
        if (chosenAuthMethod &amp; SupportedAuthMethods::AUTH_PUBLICKEY)
        {
            //int result = 0;
            int result = libssh2_userauth_publickey(this-&gt;session, this-&gt;getUsername().c_str(), key, sizeofkey, SSHTunnelForwarder::publicKeyAuthComplete, 0);
            if (result != 0)
            {
                char * error = NULL;
                int len = 0;

                jsonResponse.generateJSONResponse(API_AUTH_FAILURE, ""InvalidPublicKey"");
                return jsonResponse.getJSONString();

            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I read somewhere that it shouldn't have new lines, that's why I'm replacing the \n for blank characters but with or without this it doesn't make a difference. </p>

<p>The very basic documentation mentions that one of the arguments for <code>libssh2_userauth_publickey</code> is a callback as follows:</p>

<p><code>int name(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, unsigned char **sig, size_t *sig_len, const unsigned char *data, size_t data_len, void **abstract);</code></p>

<p>but I cannot find any information anywhere as to what this callback is or what it should contain. In my function call to libssh2_userauth_publickey I pass in <code>SSHTunnelForwarder::publicKeyAuthComplete</code> and currently this function just has the following:</p>

<pre><code>int SSHTunnelForwarder::publicKeyAuthComplete(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, unsigned char **sig, size_t *sig_len,
    const unsigned char *data, size_t data_len, void **abstract)
{
    cout &lt;&lt; ""In SSH Auth Callback"" &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This method above doesn't get called, although I'm expecting that this isn't even close to being correct. </p>

<p>When I run my code above the result of libssh2_userauth_publickey is 19 and the error that is returned from the <code>get_last_message()</code> method is <code>invalid public key</code>. I know the public key file is fine as I can use it in an SSH app on Android and can successfully authenticate with my server. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1</strong></p>

<p>I've managed to make some progress, I found there is a function called:</p>

<pre><code>libssh2_userauth_publickey_frommemory(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, const char *username, size_t username_len, const char *publickeyfiledata, size_t publickeyfiledata_len, const char *privatekeyfiledata, size_t privatekeyfiledata_len, const char *passphrase);
</code></pre>

<p>The libssh2 version that I had was from NuGet Package manager and found that the latest version in this is actually quite old, so I've build the latest 1.7.0 version from GitHub inside Visual Studio and relinked my project to this new version. </p>

<p>I have now replaced the original publickey auth function I was using with this version so my code now looks like this instead:</p>

<pre><code>int result = libssh2_userauth_publickey_frommemory(this-&gt;session, username.c_str(), username.length(), nullptr, 0, test.c_str(), sizeofkey, nullptr);
</code></pre>

<p>This function confuses me a little that it wants the public key and the private key, for everything I know about SSH (admittedly not a huge amount) the public key stays on the server, and the user wanting to login only has access to the private key. </p>

<p>I found that someone else was asking this and a patch was done to allow a null pointer for the public key, so I have passed nullptr for the public key and 0 for the public key length. I've also put a nullptr for the certificate passphrase as this hasn't been set. </p>

<p>When I run this code now I now get the error -18 which is <code>invalid username/public key combination</code>. Again though, I know the username and private key file I am using is correct as I can use it in an SSH client application on Android to connect to my SSH server. </p>
","<p>I've found the solution. What I did in update 1 was the actual fix but my server key got changed for some reason not sure why, so when it said that it couldn't link the username with the key it was correct. </p>

<p>The complete fix is as follows:</p>

<p>Don't use the libssh2 from NuGet its very old. I downloaded the latest source from GitHub at <a href=""https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/releases"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/releases</a> and then completed the follwing steps to build libssh2 within Visual Studio. </p>

<ul>
<li>Shove all the .c files in libssh2/src into an empty Win32 C++ (DLL 
or Static Library) project except libgcrypt.c/openssl.c of which you 
only pick the one appropriate to your crypto library. </li>
<li>Add your OpenSSL or libgcrypt include directory to the project include path </li>
<li>Add libssh2/include to the project include path </li>
<li>Add libssh2/win32 to the project include path </li>
<li>Add the appropriate crypto libraries to the project Additonal Libraries list </li>
<li>Build </li>
<li>Job done </li>
</ul>

<p>Steps above taken from <a href=""https://www.libssh2.org/mail/libssh2-devel-archive-2012-09/0029.shtml"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.libssh2.org/mail/libssh2-devel-archive-2012-09/0029.shtml</a></p>

<p>The libssh2 was linked to openssl during compilation. </p>

<p>Link your project to the latest build you've just done for libssh2 and use the method </p>

<pre><code>libssh2_userauth_publickey_frommemory(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, const char *username, size_t username_len, const char *publickeyfiledata, size_t publickeyfiledata_len, const char *privatekeyfiledata, size_t privatekeyfiledata_len, const char *passphrase);

","<p>A certificate is not a public key although it contains one; more importantly, either a private key or public key or certificate for a public-key-crypto (aka asymmetric) scheme like RSA is not a symmetric key. Java <code>SecretKeySpec</code> is only for symmetric keys used with symmetric algorithms, like AES. </p>

<p>You need to represent your RSA keys using subtypes of <code>java.security.PrivateKey</code> and <code>java.security.PublicKey</code>. The way you do this is with a <code>KeyFactory</code> for RSA, or a <code>CertificateFactory</code> (as you already did). </p>

<p>For a PKCS#8-encoded private key, which is what you encoded and wrote out, decode it from PEM/base64 to <code>byte[]</code>, then:</p>

<pre><code>PKCS8EncodedKeySpec spec = new PKCSEncodedKeySpec (bytearray);
KeyFactory factory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
PrivateKey privkey = factory.generatePrivate (spec);
// use privkey in a Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"") to decrypt or sign
</code></pre>

<p>For a certificate do basically what you already did: </p>

<pre><code>InputStream is = /* something that returns contents of cert file */;
// you *can* decode from PEM/base64 first, but you don't need to;
// CertificateFactory-X.509 handles both
CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance (""X.509"");
Certificate cert = cf.generateCertificate (is);
// use cert.getPublicKey() for RSA encrypt or verify
</code></pre>

<p>Aside: sigAlgName for a certificate does NOT tell about the key <em>in</em> the cert. It is entirely possible for a cert signed SHA1withRSA to contain a DSA or ECC key that cannot be used for RSA, and conversely possible for a cert that contains a perfectly good RSA key to be signed with a different RSA variant (like SHA256withRSA) or an entirely different algorithm (like sha1-DSA or sha2-ECDSA).</p>

<p>Also note: you are explicitly importing <code>java.security.cert.Certificate</code>; that's good. JRE also has an older and deprecated <code>java.security.Certificate</code> which you should not use, but if you just say <code>Certificate</code> some IDEs (like mine) may get confused and give you the wrong one.</p>

"21757387","RSA algorithm in Java : How works getEncoded method on java.security.Key interface?","<p>I would like to be more familiar with the RSA algorithm and I have made small project for that. Actually everithing works fine, I can encrypt and decrypt a message correctly but I don't know if my key generation is performed correctly (my objective is to obtain a public key with a byte array representation that I can export for other parts).</p>

<p>Here comes how my keys are generated:</p>

<pre><code>KeyPairGenerator keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"");
SecureRandom random = SecureRandom.getInstance(""SHA1PRNG"", ""SUN""); 

random.nextBytes(new byte[128]);

keyGen.initialize(1024, random);

KeyPair keyPair = keyGen.generateKeyPair();

PublicKey pubKey = keyPair.getPublic();
PrivateKey privKey = keyPair.getPrivate();

byte[] publicKeyEncoded  = pubKey.getEncoded();
byte[] privateKeyEncoded = privKey.getEncoded();
</code></pre>

<p>My question is about the getEncoded method, each time my program is executed a new key pair seems to be generated (according my trace) but when I call this method I have still the same value, it seems fixed. The value is changed when the method is called a second times and is changed each times that I call it in my program, but if a new execution is performed, the first value is the same as first value of the previous execution event if the keys differs. </p>

<p>According the documentation it seems that it ""Returns the key in its primary encoding format ..."", I have checked my key format, it is X.509, but there is nothing about the described behavior.</p>

<p>Can you please give me more details about that ?</p>
","<p>I have tested the code snippet you provided in a standalone java program. Every time I call it, a new different key is generated. If your code always generate the same sequence of key it means that the random number generator produces the same sequence of number.</p>

<p>SHA1PRNG is a PRNG, it means that the sequence of number produced depends on a seed. If the PRGN is seeded twice with the same seed, it will produce the same sequence of numbers. The seed is set as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>by calling <code>setSeed(byte[])</code> on <code>SecureRandom</code></li>
<li>the first <code>next</code>/<code>nextBytes</code> is called <strong>and <code>setSeed</code> has not been previously called</strong> the PRGN is seeded with a secure mechanism provided by the underlying OS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the code you posted here does not call <code>setSeed</code>, the <code>SecureRandom</code> object should be properly seeded with some true random value.</p>

<p>My suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Are you sure that you do not call <code>setSeed</code> (with the same seed value)? This could explain this behavour. Note also that the key encoding provided by <code>getEncoded()</code> always starts with the same byte sequence <code>30819f300d06092a864886f70d010101050003818d00</code></p></li>
<li><p>Try to use <code>random = new SecureRandom()</code>. It will use the default <code>SecureRandom</code> implementation for your platform (For windows as far as I known it is the SHA1PRNG implementation but Linux and MaxOSX are using another implementation)</p></li>

"49057905","Calculating d value in RSA","<p>I saw a couple questions about this but most of them were answered in unhelpful way or didn't get a proper answer at all. <br/> I have these variables:</p>

<ul>
<li>p = 31</li>
<li>q = 23</li>
<li>e - public key exponent = 223</li>
<li>phi - (p-1)*(q-1) = 660
<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>Now I need to calculate <code>d</code> variable (which I know is equal 367). The problem is that I don't know how. I found this equation on the internet but it doesn't work (or I can't use it):</p>

<pre><code>e⋅d=1modϕ(n)
</code></pre>

<p>When I see that equation i think that it means this:</p>

<pre><code>d=(1modϕ(n))/e
</code></pre>

<p>But apparently it doesn't because 367 (1modϕ(n))/e = 1%660/223 = 1/223 != 367
<br/> Maybe I don't understand and I did something wrong - that's why I ask.</p>

<p>I did some more research and I found second equation:</p>

<pre><code>d=1/e mod ϕ(n)
or
d=e^-1 mod ϕ(n)
</code></pre>

<p>But in the end it gives the same result:
1/e mod ϕ(n) = 1/223 % 660 = 1/223 != 367</p>

<p>Then I saw some guy saying that to solve that equation you need <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">extended Euclidean algorithm</a> If anyone knows how to use it to solve that problem then I'd be very thankful if you help me.</p>
","<p>If you want to calculate something like a / b mod p, you can't just divide it and take division remainder from it. Instead, you have to find such b<sup>-1</sup> that b<sup>-1</sup> = 1/b mod p (b<sup>-1</sup> is a modular multiplicative inverse of b mod p). If p is a prime, you can use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_little_theorem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fermat's little theorem</a>. It states that for any prime p, a<sup>p</sup> = a mod p &lt;=> a<sup>(p - 2)</sup> = 1/a mod p. So, instead of a / b mod p, you have to compute something like a * b<sup>(p - 2)</sup> mod p. b<sup>(p - 2)</sup> can be computed in O(log(p))
 using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">exponentiation by squaring</a>. If p is not a prime, modular multiplicative inverse exists if and only if GCD(b, p) = 1. Here, we can use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm#Extended_Euclidean_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">extended euclidean algorithm</a> to solve equation bx + py = 1 in logarithmic time. When we have bx + py = 1, we can take it mod p and we have bx = 1 mod p &lt;=> x = 1/b mod p, so x is our b<sup>-1</sup>. If GCD(b, p) ≠ 1, b<sup>-1</sup> mod p doesn't exist.</p>

<p>Using either Fermat's theorem or the euclidean algorithm gives us same result in same time complexity, but the euclidean algorithm can also be used when we want to compute something modulo number that's not a prime (but it has to be coprime with numer want to divide by).</p>

It seems to work for checkouts, updates and commits, but if someone tries to merge or uses the ^ operator to copy, it crashes.</p>

<p>Let me give more information in the form of an example: The svn repository is in the folder /home/bob/svn/project of machine mymachine.myhost.com and belongs to user bob (aka: me). I generated a key for alice and added the following line to /home/bob/.ssh/authorized_keys:</p>

<pre><code>command=""/usr/bin/svnserve -t -r /home/bob/svn/project --tunnel-user=Alice"",no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty ssh-rsa &lt;alices key&gt; alice
</code></pre>

<p>Alice was able to checkout the repository using</p>

<pre><code>svn co svn+ssh://bob@mymachine.myhost.com@
</code></pre>

<p>She can commit changes and update. However, if she tries to merge or do svn cp using the ^ operator on her machine as follows:</p>

<pre><code>svn cp ^/trunk/ branches/alicesbranch
</code></pre>

<p>te server does not react and after a while she gets the following message</p>

<pre><code>svn: E210002: Unable to connect to a repository at URL 'svn+ssh://bob@mymachine.myhost.com/trunk/'
svn: E210002: To better debug SSH connection problems, remove the -q option from 'ssh' in the [tunnels] section of your Subversion configuration file.
svn: E210002: Network connection closed unexpectedly
</code></pre>

<p>After some research, I gave up, because in most cases I only get discussions from people where the repository could not be accessed at all. However in my case, I/Alice <strong>do</strong> have access, but not as general as some svn operations Seem to need.</p>

<p>I believe that I did something wrong with the combination of the svnserve command and the path Alice uses to checkout, but I don't know what.</p>

<p>In reality, the server is a machine for which I don't have root access. Also, the network seems to be very shielded from external access: Only ssh is allowed, but as soon as for example the above error occurs, I/Alice cannot login at all on said hostname for a while, probably because the firewall declines access for a while for security reasons because of a failed ssh connection. This is also why I cannot just go ahead and do lots of trial-and-errors with different svnserve commands and different checkout commands, because every error will force me to wait until I can do another trial.</p>

<p>This is why I hope someone here can help me. I hope I gave enough information to pin down the problem.</p>

<p>If I do </p>

<pre><code>svn cp ^/trunk ^/branches/mytestbranch
</code></pre>

<p>instead, it seems to work! However, I still cannot merge </p>

<pre><code>cd trunk 
svn merge ^/branches/mytestbranch .
</code></pre>

<p>leads to the known error.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong></p>

<p>It seems as if everything fails which tries to access anything beyond the root directory.
For example: </p>

<pre><code>svn co svn+ssh://bob@mymachine.myhost.com@
</code></pre>

<p>works, but [assuming the basic setup where ""svnserve -r /home/bob/svn/project"" is used]</p>

<pre><code>svn co svn+ssh://bob@mymachine.myhost.com/trunk
</code></pre>

<p>fails. This seems to be a common denominator to all failing and working cases.</p>
","<p>First you need to create the svn structure, by creating the directories trunk, branches and tags in the root of the project and commit this changes. Otherwise there is obviously no trunk and branches on the server an the <code>^/trunk</code> and <code>^/branches/branch</code> commands fail.</p>

<p>The problem is, you are checking out the whole repository instead of the trunk. You are supposed to work on the trunk or the branch and use <code>svn switch</code> to switch between them. To get it work, try to checkout the project with this command:</p>

<pre><code>svn co svn+ssh://bob@mymachine.myhost.co/project/trunk
</code></pre>

<p>If you now try to merge it should work. The problem is, you are trying to merge the whole repository with the branch, which is actually a subfolder of that repository. So to switch to the Alice branch use:</p>

<pre><code>svn switch ^/branches/mytestbranch
</code></pre>

<p>If you want want merge it back to trunk, switch back to it first by using</p>

<pre><code>svn switch ^/trunk
</code></pre>

<p>And then doing a </p>

<pre><code>svn merge ^/branches/mytestbranch
</code></pre>

"6460845","Standard way to hash an RSA key?","<p>What's the algorithm for creating hash (sha-1 or MD5) of an RSA public key?  Is there a standard way to do this?  Hash just the modulus, string addition of both and then take a hash?  Is SHA-1 or MD5 usually used?</p>

<p>I want to use it to ensure that I got the right key (have the sender send a hash, and I calculate it myself), and log said hash so I always know which exact key I used when I encrypt the payload.</p>
","<p>Based on the OpenSSH source code, the way that a fingerprint is generated for RSA keys is to convert n and e from the public key to big-endian binary data, concatenate the data and then hash that data with the given hash function.</p>

<p>Portions of the OpenSSH source code follows.  The comments were added to clarify what is happening.</p>

<pre><code>// from key_fingerprint_raw() in key.c
switch (k-&gt;type) {
case KEY_RSA1:
    // figure out how long n and e will be in binary form

    elen = BN_num_bytes(k-&gt;rsa-&gt;e);
    len = nlen + elen;
    // allocate space for n and e and copy the binary data into blob
    blob = xmalloc(len);
    BN_bn2bin(k-&gt;rsa-&gt;n, blob);
    BN_bn2bin(k-&gt;rsa-&gt;e, blob + nlen);

<p>From the <code>BN_bn2bin</code> <a href=""http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/BN_bn2bin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">manual page</a>:</p>

<p><code>BN_bn2bin(a, to)</code> converts the absolute value of <code>a</code> into <em>big-endian</em> form and stores it at <code>to</code>. <code>to</code> must point to <code>BN_num_bytes(a)</code> bytes of memory. </p>

"19272734","SSH connect with Putty/Win7 to OpenSSH/Debian shows Server refused public-key signature despite accepting key","<p>i'm running a server with Debian Linux 3.2.46 and OpenSSH Server 6.0 and secured the login with a 2048 bit RSA key.</p>

<p>Although connecting with OpenSSH Client from another machine works, the connection is refused when using Putty 0.63 on a Windows 7 machine with the following message:</p>

<pre><code>Server refused public-key signature despite accepting key!
</code></pre>

<p>Because the problem applies only to Putty, i think all server configuration is correct. Putty works fine when running the server with Debian 2.6.32 and OpenSSH 5.5.</p>

<p>In local (with docker on my server), I can connect to ssh with my private key to the container. But when I start container on Bluemix, I can't connect to ssh even after attribute public ip address and, of course, publish 22 tcp port.</p>

<p>Then I go to bluexmix web dashboard to attribute public ip address</p>

","<p>One principle in using containers is that a container should not start more than one process, in your case ssh and whatever the container is running.
Also there is another way to access your container with <code>exec</code></p>

<p>Scince Docker 1.3 you can access an runing container with:</p>

<p><code>docker exec COMMAND</code></p>

<p>in practice for bluemix:</p>

<p><code>cf ic exec -it CONTAINER /bin/bash</code></p>

<p>this starts the binary bash with an absolute path (/bin/bash part) and attaches the tty interactively + keeps connection open (-it part).</p>

<p>Having a friend who has got the same laptop as me (last mbp Retina 13""), with whom ssh localhost works fine, I noted that he's got the additional lines at the beginning when executing ssh -vvv localhost :</p>

<p>You will find in the server log something about not using your <code>authorized_keys</code>, because it has too wide permissions. You should change the permissions to be readable and writable only by you: <code>chmod 600 ~/.ssh.authorized_keys</code></p>

When I try the command</p>

<pre><code>    ssh localhost

<p>I still get asked for a password. So I thought that the problem could come from some parameter avoiding public keys without passphrase and I created a new publickey/privatekey couple with a passphrase. But still, I get the following message :</p>

<p>For information, I created the key couple with the command :</p>

<pre><code>    ssh-keygen -t dsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa

","<p>Certificate is actually the block of information which binds your identity (i.e. your name, email, whatever else) to some public key. It is public so everyone can know that this key belongs to you.
So when you will sign something they will know that actually you signed this. 
The other thing is validating certificate - that's for what trusted root certificates are used.</p>

","<p>A PKCS#12 file can contain <strong><em>both</em></strong> the certificate and the private key.  They are, however, stored as separate, distinct objects.  The certificate itself has the <em>public key</em> embedded within it.  Since the certificate only contains the public key, it is considered ""public"" as well.  You can feel free to distribute the certificate, as it does not contain the <strong><em>private key</em></strong>, which should be kept confidential.  This is the basis of the security in asymmetric cryptography.</p>

<p>Because a PKCS#12 file contains <strong><em>both</em></strong> items, it is encrypted with a password to protect the private key within it.  That said, you would <em>use</em> the private key to prove that the <em>certificate</em> you distribute belongs to you.  For example, through the use of a digital signature on a document.</p>

<li><p>You are giving remote command as a list and also giving <code>shell=True</code> these are in a way mutually exclusive options. If you want use shell=True then you give command as a single string.</p></li>

This abstraction requires that each stored <code>PrivateKey</code> has a corresponding chain of <code>Certificate</code> instances (one or more certificate).

KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(...);
keyStore.load(...;);
PrivateKey privateKey = (PrivateKey) keyStore.getKey(alias, null);

<p>After some research I figured out that I have to get a public key by using a certificate, and it should look like <a href=""https://github.com/seishun/node-steam/blob/master/lib/public.pub"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>.</p>

<p>I am using php, and thus I am using this code to retrieve a public key from a certificate:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$pub_key = openssl_pkey_get_public(file_get_contents('./cert.crt'));
$keyData = openssl_pkey_get_details($pub_key);
file_put_contents('./key.pub', $keyData['key']);
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I am confused as to which certificate do I use. Do I use the certificate of the Steam website? (<code>cert.crt</code> would be the certificate)</p>
","<p>I have the same doubt. I'd not tried it yet, but:</p>

<pre><code>curl -X POST ""http://store.steampowered.com/login/getrsakey/"" 
     -d username=""your_username""
</code></pre>

<p>Gives you a RSA key...</p>

","<p>The OpenSSL functions to print the public RSA key do not seem to be exported by the Python OpenSSL wrapper. By accessing the internals of the <code>crypto</code> module, you could still do it yourself (assuming that you have this package installed locally), as this code snippet shows:</p>

Since I was going to use this C# program on various devices the Keys are not the same, so I would like to print out a message box or something similar to the user giving them the option that you would normally see through WinSCP.com:</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>winscp&gt; (U)pdate,(A)dd,Can(n)cel,(C)opy Key,(S)kip: Cancel

<p>Right now I'm displaying the options to the user with <code>winscp.StandardOutput.ReadLine()</code> and giving them a choice what the return with <code>winscp.StandardInput.WriteLine([user choice])</code> but this dosn't seem to work.  I keep getting ""Host Key Wasn't Verified!"".  Any suggestions on how to approach this one?  Thanks.</p>

<p>Edit:
I believe this has something to do with WinSCP not waiting for input.  I changed the echo option to 'on' so I could see my response and my response occures after WinSCP has already rejected the connection.  </p>

<p>My options on WinSCP are currently: batch abort, confirm on, echo on.  </p>

<p>So now I guess is there anyway for WinSCP to wait for my commands from the .exe?</p>
","<p>So far I've got it working via a ""psudo"" first connection.  I know it's not very pretty and people will (and probably should) scream at me for doing it this way.  First off I make an attempted connection to the end device,</p>

<pre><code>winscp.StandardInput.WriteLine(open scp://name:pass@xx.xx.xx.xx);
</code></pre>

<p>But that's just to get the key from the end device since I can scan the outputs from winscp and find a message that happens to show that lovely key.  So then, now knowing my device's RSA key I can then prompt the user: 'You're CPU dosn't know this device... Connect anyways?' [yes/no/cancel].  If they say yes then I can explicitly give winscp the hostkey I'm looking for and connect,</p>

<pre><code>winscp.StandardInput.WriteLine(open scp://name:pass@xx.xx.xx.xx -hostkey: *****);
</code></pre>

<p>Like I said it's not the prettiest, and I'd like to do it with a single connection attempt.  But whatever gets the job done right?  I'm still looking into this for a better option.</p>

<p>Both symmetric and asymmetric encryption have there pros and cons, you should first figure out what you (or your client) want.

<p>See the OpenSSL wiki page <a href=""http://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Random_Numbers"" rel=""nofollow"">Random Numbers</a>. It takes you through it in grueling detail.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>... no mention is made of seeding when the EVP functions are used</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The EVP functions use whatever generator is in use for the library. It could be <code>md_rand</code> or a FIPS AES/CTR generator. There's nothing special to get random numbers for the EVP functions (as opposed to other functions).</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>May I assume that the seeding is done internally for me in the higher-level EVP functions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, <em>if</em> you did not seed the generator yourself. If you seeded the generator and there's sufficient entropy, then it will not auto-seed itself.</p>

<p>You should avoid allowing the generator to auto-seed itself. See the OpenSSL wiki page <a href=""http://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Random_Numbers"" rel=""nofollow"">Random Numbers</a> for the details.</p>

<p>There's nothing special about seeding/auto-seeding a generator when using EVP interfaces. Whatever you do applies to everything.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I do need to do it then which functions must I have a look at?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The OpenSSL wiki page <a href=""http://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Random_Numbers"" rel=""nofollow"">Random Numbers</a> provides more details, but you should do something like:</p>

<pre><code>int rc = RAND_load_file(""/dev/urandom"", 32);
if(rc != 32) {
    /* RAND_load_file failed */
}

/* OK to proceed */
</code></pre>

<p>You want to avoid a direct call to <code>RAND_poll</code>, and you want to avoid auto-seeding (which calls <code>RAND_poll</code> internally).</p>

","<p>Just to be sure of your requirement of this <strong>master password</strong>,  </p>

<ol>
<li>Is it expected to be used only as a '<strong><code>encrypt this</code></strong>' command that will 'seal' something<br>
which can then only be opened by someone knowing the private key in question?  Or,

<ul>
<li>Is it something you expect to open any encryption done in the enterprise?</li>
<li>I just want to be sure your phrasing is not to be interpreted in this second way</li>
<li>your phrase '<strong><code>decrypt any data</code></strong>' sounds dangerous<br>
(and not-feasible/practical with asymmetric key encryption)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Update based on the comment. </p>

<ul>
<li>You are planning for <strong>two copies of the data</strong> each encrypted with different keys

<ul>
<li><strong>one copy</strong> is to be encrypted with the <strong>master public</strong> key

<ul>
<li>can be decrypted with anyone having the <strong>master private</strong> key<br>
the master private key must then be secured (public key is not critical)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the <strong>second copy</strong> is to be encrypted with the <code>Rijndael 256</code> key</li>
</ul></li>
<li>purpose is to allow the master to decrypt the data whenever required<br>
particularly, in the absence of the individual who encrypted it</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach will work for,
easy access of the data by the individual with the Rijndael key,<br>
without need for intervention by the master private key owner.<br>
And, when the master private key owner is trusted with the secrecy of the data.  </p>

<p>Your scheme will need to update the master copy (deleting the older one and re-encrypting a new one) every time the user updates their copy.</p>

<hr>

<p>However, if the <strong>user data is trusted with the master</strong> (as is clearly the case here),  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>an easier approach</strong> would be to issue the Rijndael key from the master</li>
<li>The master could keep it encrypted with the master-public key itself</li>
<li>The data can then be encrypted with just the issued Rijndael key 

<ul>
<li>it will always be accessible with the master-private key<br>
which can open the user's Rijndael key </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>If the user needs to sign the data, that can be accomplished separately in the process.<br>
It will save you from keeping double copies and maintaining them.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>To sign the data</strong>, the user could have a a key pair generated by them.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Before encrypting the data with the Rijndael private-key</li>
<li>the <strong>master-public key</strong> encrypted with the <strong>user-private-key</strong> can be appended to it</li>
<li>the <strong>user-public key</strong> shared with the master (at least)<br>
will be sufficient to authenticate that the user has provided the data</li>
<li>In a worst-case scenario, if the user is unavailable and the key confirmation fails,<br>
the master may be trusted on the authenticity of the data -- which can still be decrypted</li>
</ul>

","<p>I don't see how that would work.  Any two-way encryption function is only going to decrypt when fed the specific password used to encrypt (unless you're the NSA and you put back doors in the algorithms).  You can't have two passwords decrypt the same file (unless there are hash collisions, but that's not something you can make happen easily).</p>

<p>As far as storing your master password in the program, it would be much better to store it in a separate file the program reads in, so you can use tighter OS-level security on that file.</p>

<p>Keep in mind mcrypt is not public key cryptography.  With public key cryptography, you might be able to do what you want, though.  For instance, with PGP/GPG, you can encrypt a file such that three different users can decrypt it using their private keys, without knowing each other's private keys.  So you can have a virtual user with the master password that can decrypt everything.</p>

<p>Another option would be to hold two copies of all encrypted data; one encrypted with the user's password, and one encrypted with the master password.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain this behaviour?</p>
","<p>That is expected.</p>

<p>The RSA cryptosystem works in group modulo some prime number. To ensure that all possible plaintexts are encrypted with the same security, the plaintexts are padded to produce a padded plaintext that is slightly smaller than the modulus. Since the padding is applied before encryption, the ciphertext looks completely different.</p>

<p>JSEncrypt is based on JSBN which in turn implements only <a href=""https://github.com/travist/jsencrypt/blob/v2.1.0/lib/jsbn/rsa.js#L28-L61"" rel=""nofollow"">PKCS#1 v1.5 padding type 2</a> (<a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2313#section-8.1"" rel=""nofollow"">RFC 2313</a>). The second type of this padding introduces random bytes that are removed after decryption because of marker bytes. At least 11 bytes are needed for the padding.</p>

<p>If you want to check the interoperability with other implementations, you need to do a full encryption-decryption cycle and make sure that you get the same plaintext back.</p>

<p>Note that nowadays, PKCS#1 v1.5 padding shouldn't be used anymore and PKCS#1 v.2 OAEP is preferred which is also randomized.</p>

<p>Then I transferred the key over to the new user on the server, ran chmod on it and then altered the SSH daemon to not allow root log in.</p>

<p>I reloaded the sshd and tried a new connection. It doesn't let me log in as root, and it does as the new user, and it seems to have the correct privileges. </p>

","<p>If you perform padding, cipher text should have fixed size equal to RSA public key modulus. If you get different size every time, then there is something with your program.</p>

<p>When you perform encryption <code>data</code> must be less than <code>RSA_size(rsa) - 11</code> and <code>encrypted</code> must point to <code>RSA_size(rsa)</code> bytes of memory.</p>

<p><code>strlen(const char * str)</code> computes length of null-terminated string. <code>encrypt</code> is not the string and is not null terminated, so using <code>strlen</code> is not valid here. Luckily for you PKCS#1 padding contains zero bytes, so you don't get segmentation fault.</p>

<p>On the other hand <code>myData</code> <strong>is</strong> a null terminated string. However, you use <code>RSA_size(rsaPub) - 11</code> as its length, which will result in occasional segmentation faults.</p>

<p>Public key auth:</p>

<p>First read RFC 4252 section 7. It describes how public key auth works. The callback provides you the public key and tells you if it is a probe of the public key or a login.</p>

<p>So first you have to read the authorized keys. Normally you have a file with all the keys in it. You use ssh_pki_import_pubkey_base64() to read the key and then call ssh_key_cmp() to compare it with the public key sent by the client. Depending if it is a probe you return partial success or auth success if it is a login.</p>

"40618715","Setting up TrustKit","<p>I am working on an application that quickly needs to include <code>https</code> for network communication. Our concern over this came about when we noticed we are sending all of our user credentials over the <code>URL</code>. This isn't good because then our usernames and passwords are out there in the open. After a lot of research it seems that pinning the public key of the server's SSL certificate is the way to go. I have decided to use <code>TrustKit</code> to pin the public key of the certificate so we do not have to pin the entire certificate in the application. That way we do not have to keep replacing the certificate overtime it expires, thus not having to build a new IPA or submit to Apple. In order to get this up and running, I need a few questions answered.</p>

<p>So I understand there are three main things I need to get started with <code>TrustKit</code>.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> I need to know the <strong>domains</strong> that we are going to be using and include them in our info.plist.</p>

<li><strong>QUESTION</strong>: Does the server at this domain need to do any preparation in order to get <code>TrustKit</code> what it needs to handle everything?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2.</strong> I need 2 public key <strong>hashes</strong> that also need to be included in the info.plist.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>QUESTION</strong>: How do I extract the public key hashes from the certificate? From where do I get these hashes?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3.</strong> I need to know what public key <strong>algorithm</strong> to use.</p>

<li><strong>QUESTION</strong>: What is this? And how do I find out which one to use?</li>

","<ol>
<li><p>The server itself does not need to do anything special but your ops/infrastructure team does; see 2. and the backup pin.</p></li>
<li><p>TrustKit provides a Python script to generate the hash and algorithm you're looking for : <a href=""https://github.com/datatheorem/TrustKit/blob/master/get_pin_from_certificate.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/datatheorem/TrustKit/blob/master/get_pin_from_certificate.py</a> . You need use the script on your domain's CA certificate (this will be the first hash), and then on another CA certificate, from which you bought a backup certificate for your domain. This backup pin is needed in case you need to quickly rotate the (first) certificate on your server, without bricking your App. This is explained in more details here: <a href=""https://noncombatant.org/2015/05/01/about-http-public-key-pinning/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://noncombatant.org/2015/05/01/about-http-public-key-pinning/</a> .</p></li>
<li><p>The script described in 2. also returns the algorithm. It is the algorithm (RSA, ECDSA) of the public key that's embedded in the server certificate. This is needed by TrustKit because iOS does not provide the APIs to automatically detect the certificate's algorithm.</p></li>

"6370470","Help verifying RSA signed text with Python","<p>Using Java I have created RSA keypairs. Using Java I can use these keys to sign and verify some text. I can also ""export"" these keys in PEM format and load them into a Python test script. Once in the Python script, I can use these keys to sign and verify some text using M2Crypto.</p>

<p>I have not yet been able to verify in Python the signature I created in Java.</p>

<p>Right now I am just trying to get cross-platform signing and verifying to work.</p>

<p>Here is Java snippet:</p>



<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>Signature sig = Signature.getInstance(""MD5WithRSA"");
sig.initSign(key.getPrivate());
sig.update(""This is a message."".getBytes(""UTF8""));
byte[] signatureBytes = sig.sign();     
return Base64.encodeBytes(signatureBytes, Base64.DO_BREAK_LINES);
</code></pre>

<p>Which generates:</p>



<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>PIp4eLhA941xmpdqu7j60731R9oWSNWcHvwoVADKxABGoUE02eDS0qZ4yQD2vYBdRDXXxHV4UjtW

<p>And here is the public key:</p>

<p>Then in Python the key is loaded and the signature is attempted to be verified:</p>

if verify_evp.verify_final(sig_string.decode('base64')) == 1:
    print ""Good""
else:
    print ""Bad""
</code></pre>

<p>And this does not verify. I suspect it is some leading or trailing characters or encoding weirdness that I don't understand.</p>

<p>I have no particular attachement to M2Crypto and have played a bit with the gdata.tlslite modules as well.</p>

<p>Please note that the keys are working, and that the text and signature above verify in Java, and the keys (public and private) can be used within Python to sign and verify text. The problem is somewhere in how Java-generated signature and/or the message text is getting into the Python code.</p>

<p>Steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the URL path to the directory containing the desired CD image.  This directory will also contain the checksum files.  (eg. <a href=""http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/8.3.0/amd64/iso-cd/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/8.3.0/amd64/iso-cd/</a> for Debian 8.3.0)</li>
<li>Download your CD image as well as the appropriate checksum and checksum signature.  (eg. SHA512SUMS and SHA512SUMS.sign)</li>
<li>Install the Debian keyring.  (sudo apt-get install debian-keyring)</li>
<li>Verify the checksum signature.  (gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-role-keys.gpg --verify SHA512SUMS.sign)  As long as ""gpg: Good signature"" is contained, you can ignore ""This key is not certified with a trusted signature!"" warnings.</li>
<li>Verify the CD image matches the checksum.  (sha512sum -c SHA512SUMS)  This must show ""debian-8.3.0-amd64-netinst.iso: OK"" or the equivalent for the CD image you downloaded.  All other images will have ""no such file"" warnings, that's fine.</li>
</ol>

<p>If (and only if) your CD image checks out as OK, you have successfully verified your image!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong><br>
Update public key field value from Chrome browser.</p>
","<p>I think what you may be seeing is that when you get the key from the browser, you're getting the whole ASN.1 raw key (denoted by the <a href=""http://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Keys_and_Formats#Hex_Encoding_and_Decoding"" rel=""nofollow"">30 82</a>), but you're getting some watered down version from <code>SSL_get_peer_certificate()</code> and/or <code>X509_get_pubkey()</code> that has removed this header and just given you the rest of the key (without the leading<code>30 82 01 0a 02 82 01 01</code> or trailing <code>02 03 01 00 01</code>).  </p>

<p>I tried to look into what exactly <code>x509_get_pubkey()</code> returns, but didn't have much luck, but this is where I would start - researching why you're getting the raw key from the browser, but something truncated from the function.</p>

# Add a new key and store the passphrase in your keychain

# After storing the private keys passphrase in the keychain,
# you can load them all, at any time

","<p>The size of the certificate and a private key depends on algorithm, key length and additional information such as names of the issuer and subject, various URLs (for CRL and OCSP shecks etc) placed to the certificate. So it is reasonable to assume the size of one certificate to be between 2 and 4 Kb (I would reserve at least 4Kb per cert + key).</p>

","<p>I'll answer your questions in order:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Where you store the key is up to you. Maybe you never want to update it. In that case you can store it as a resource or even ""hard coded"". In that case you have to create an update to your application to update it. Public keys are public, so there is no need to keep them safe. On the other hand, you may want to add some code to check if your <em>trust store</em> is not altered. You could also use a Java keystore like JKS, but in that case you need to create a certificate chain. Just sending them to the application is not a good idea; you need a secure path to avoid Man-in-the-Middle attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Asymmetric encryption with RSA is certainly defined in the PKCS#1 standards (implemented in the Sun provider, using <code>Cipher</code> in Java. There are two schemes defined, the PKCS#1 v1.5 scheme and OAEP. The latter is more safe.</p></li>

<p>I have also read this <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9619030/resolving-javax-net-ssl-sslhandshakeexception-sun-security-validator-validatore"">link</a> myt question is not duplicate since its a completly different connection type - this is a JDBC connection with conneciton manager and not a general URL connection with SSL.</p>

<p>and many more, all the stack overflow solution I found offered to trust server certificate which means skip the public key verification </p>

<p>This is my code:</p>

<pre><code>String connectionString = ""jdbc:mysql://abcd-efg.rds.amazonaws.com:3306/test?trustServerCertificate=false&amp;useSSL=true&amp;requireSSL=true&amp;verifyServerCertificate=true""


    File f = new File(""C:\\temp\\amazonPublic.pem"");
    CertificateFactory fact = null;
    fact = CertificateFactory.getInstance(""X.509"");
    X509Certificate cer = (X509Certificate) fact.generateCertificate(new FileInputStream(f));
    KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
    char[] password = new char[] {'1','2','3','4'};
    ks.load(null, password);
    ks.setCertificateEntry(""alias"", cer);
    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(new File(""C:\\temp\\ca.cer""));
    ks.store(fos, password);
    fos.close();
    Properties p = new Properties();
    p.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStore"",""C:\\temp\\ca.cer"");
    p.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword"",""1234"");
    try (java.sql.Connection connection =
            DriverManager.getConnection(connectionString,p)) {

        connection.isValid(1000);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the error:</p>

<p>What am I missing in the solution?</p>
","<p>For the sake of Humankind while working with MariaDB driver - debugging it
I find out that: 
The property should be <code>""serverSslCert""</code> or <code>""trustStore""</code>
The prefix of <code>javax.net.ssl</code>  only required when working with <code>System.setProperty</code></p>

<p>So this simple change did the trick.</p>

","<p>SubjectPublicKeyInfo - ASN1 structure for public keys which is described in rfc 3280(Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure).

<p>You're referring to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RSA</a>, I assume?</p>

<p>FYI, RSA isn't actually used to encrypt documents. It's used to exchange keys (keys for a symmetric algorithm, like AES).</p>

<p>So what you're really talking about is an approach that changes the keys.</p>

<p>Technically (mathmatically) if you put a different number in, you'll get a different number out. So that's not an issue; changing the public key in some fashion will (assuming you convince your RSA implementation to use it, or prepare an appropriately different number) result in a different symmetric key, thus an undecryptable document by Bob (because he'll expect a different key).</p>

<p>Really, though, I'm not so sure you care about this. It's a fairly useless thing to do. <em>Perhaps</em>, however, you're actually interested in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_splitting"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Key Splitting</a> (or ""Secret Sharing"" as wikipedia seems to call it).</p>

<p>HTH. I'm by no means an expert.</p>

","<p>As silky implies in his answer, the way in which RSA is usually used to encrypt a document is in combination with a symmetric algorithm, like AES.  A secure random key is generated for the AES algorithm, the documented is encrypted with that AES key, and the AES key is encrypted with the recipient's public key.  Both parts are supplied to the recipient.</p>

<p>You can adapt this to your situation simply by sending only the document encrypted with the AES key in the first step, and withholding the AES key encrypted with the recipient's public key until the second step.  The first part will be on the order of the original file size, and the second part will be a small, constant size (on the order of the RSA key size).</p>

","<p>(I assume you talk about RSA.)</p>

<p>Yes it is possible, <strong>but not 100%</strong>.</p>

<p>The public key is a part of the private key. It contains the modulus and the exponent of the key. </p>

<p>You can completely forget changing the modulus, because you would have to generate a new rsa keypair, which is the same problem as the one we are trying to solve.</p>

<p>But it is possible to change the exponent. You can select any (prime) number between 1 and your exponent as the new exponent and <strong>hope</strong> that it is coprime with the totient. Without knowing the totient it's impossible to select always a correct exponent. To find out the totient you would have to know the prime factors of the key, which means that you would have to break the key (have fun!).</p>

<p>So, <strong>it's actually impossible</strong> to have a 100% percent working method to do that, at least not while knowing only the public key.</p>

<p>I am assuming RSA for the keys generation, encryption and decryption but if it's easier to do with another scheme feel free to comment.</p>
","<p>I hope my idea works. </p>

<p>Let us assume that <code>(e,d,n)</code> is a tuple of the RSA public exponent. The RSA private exponent and the RSA modulus <em>n</em> :</p>

<p>Select a prime number, say <em>p</em>,  between 1 and a 256 bit integer.</p>

<p>To <strong>encrypt</strong> a message <em>m</em>, compute the new public exponent as <code>e*p</code> and the ciphertext as: </p>

<p><code>c= m^{e*p} mod n</code>. </p>

<p>To <strong>decrypt</strong>, the receiver should know the prime <em>p</em>, so you send this <em>p</em> later to him, with this he computes </p>

<p>(1) <code>P = p^{-1} mod phi(n)</code></p>

<p>and</p>

<p>(2) <code>m^e=c^{P} mod n</code> </p>

<p>and </p>

<p>finally <code>m=(m^e)^d mod n</code>. This works as the receiver knows phi(n). </p>

<p>By the way, where can we use this? Is there any application you have in mind for this?</p>

","<p>Cookies are sent in each request. This is really really bad because you want the private key to not sent over the network as much as possible.</p>

<p>Assuming you can't have local storage (IE7), the only way I know to store info on the cient side is cookies. I'd say : use local storage as much as possible, and when you can't, store the private key on the server side. At least, you'll be sending it once. it's bad, but less than really really bad ...</p>

<p>Or maybe you could store cookies on a dedicated subdomain that you never use again, but in order to read the cookie, even on the client side with javascript, you need to be on a page of that subdomain, and that means sending the key over the network again everytime you want to use it.</p>

","<p>The main problem is  that cookies are only meant for things you are sending to the server. They are not meant for storage and you should not be sending your private key anywhere, ever.</p>

<p>Cookies can be stolen via XSS (always assume you have an XSS vuln in your site) and the attacker can then try to decrypt it.</p>

<p>On the grand scale of things you could do a lot worse. Assuming your crypto is solid, the private key is probably safe, but the big issue is that you shouldn't be using cookies like this. Using Web Storage is probably a far better solution here.</p>

","<p>I´d say that saving your private key in a cookies isn´t a really good choice since they are not supposed to hold sensitive information due security reasons, and our colleagues already told other reasons.
It´s also important to notice that the user may clear all his cookies at any given time or disable it at all.
The applet would meet better your customer requirements and would let you for example prompt the user to save a keystore file with the private key, this kind file was designed to hold this kind of information.</p>

","<p>Two hashes are required and they must be two independent hashes. I.e. You cannot pin the cert and the intermediate cert that issued that as they are not independent. This is a safety feature to ensure you have a backup incase you need it.</p>

<p>Additionally a policy will only be accepted if it passes so you cannot put in a fake policy and watch it fail because it will never be accepted.</p>

<p>A good tool to check your policy is this one: <a href=""https://report-uri.io/home/pkp_analyse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://report-uri.io/home/pkp_analyse</a>
And also other tools on same site to actually generate your policy:
<a href=""https://report-uri.io/home/pkp_hash"" rel=""nofollow"">https://report-uri.io/home/pkp_hash</a></p>

<p>However you need to be VERY careful with HPKP. It's very easy to block your website and, hope you don't take this the wrong way, it doesn't sound like you fully understand HPKP so I would suggest you read about it some more first.</p>

<p>There is a Public-Key-Pins-Report-Only (which is only available in Chrome at present) , and which allows you to test a policy for a bit (well in Chrome at least) but for that you also need to use the report-uri option (you can also use above site to collect your reports if you don't want to write your own service for this).</p>

<p>I've an active interest in this and, if people don't mind me linking here, I've blogged about it in much more detail here: <a href=""https://www.tunetheweb.com/security/http-security-headers/hpkp/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.tunetheweb.com/security/http-security-headers/hpkp/</a>.

<p>i have an error because when i am converting it back to bytes the second time and then when it convert backs to public key it becomes invalid hence the error </p>

<p><strong>Additional Infornmation</strong></p>

<p>but when i just do this it works fine but my goal is to first convert the public key to a string some how then convert that string to type public key and the only way i can do that is by converting the public key which is in string type to a byte type and then converting it back to a public key
i can not convert a string direct to a public key as it wont work </p>
","<p>You need to use <strong>Base64</strong> encoding system while converting to String type.<br>
 <strong>tostring()</strong> method uses JVM default encoding which does not support your characters.</p>

<pre><code>PublicKey public_key = CryptographyHelper.ellipticCurveCrypto().getPublic();     
System.out.println(""PUBLIC KEY::"" + public_key);

//converting public key to byte            
byte[] byte_pubkey = public_key.getEncoded();
System.out.println(""\nBYTE KEY::: "" + byte_pubkey);

//converting byte to String 
String str_key = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(byte_pubkey);
// String str_key = new String(byte_pubkey,Charset.);
System.out.println(""\nSTRING KEY::"" + str_key);

//converting string to Bytes
byte_pubkey  = Base64.getDecoder().decode(str_key);
System.out.println(""BYTE KEY::"" + byte_pubkey);


//converting it back to public key
KeyFactory factory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""ECDSA"", ""BC"");
public_key = (ECPublicKey) factory.generatePublic(new X509EncodedKeySpec(byte_pubkey));

","<p><strong>OpenSSH public key files</strong> (<code>id_*.pub</code> also the entries in <code>known_hosts</code> and <code>authorized_keys</code>) for SSH2 use an OpenSSH-specific variant of an SSH-specific format, see <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4716"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rfc4716</a> which is in turn based on the SSH2 wire format (as linked) <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253#section-6.6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rfc4253 6.6</a>, which is <strong>not the 'X.509' format Java crypto uses</strong>. (OpenSSH file formats for SSH1 were different, but SSH1 is long broken and should not be used.)</p>

<p>To convert this in Java see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19365940/convert-openssh-rsa-key-to-javax-crypto-cipher-compatible-format"">convert openSSH rsa key to javax.crypto.Cipher compatible format</a> .</p>

<p>It's easier to avoid the problem. </p>

<p><strong>Bypass 1:</strong> If you have reasonably recent OpenSSH (6.0 is okay, not sure for earlier), use</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -e -m PKCS8 -f id_rsa.pub &gt;pub.pem # change filename as needed
</code></pre>

<p>to convert to 'X.509' (really SubjectPublicKeyInfo aka SPKI) in PEM form. (Yes they do use the name PKCS8 to mean SPKI; <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/27913/why-can-ssh-keygen-export-a-public-key-in-pem-pkcs8-format"">it's crazy</a>.) Then read this in Java by discarding the BEGIN and END lines, decode everything in between (less the line breaks) from base64 to <code>byte[]</code>, and put that in <code>X509EncodedKeySpec</code> as you have now. Or if you have OpenSSL you can convert to DER form </p>

<pre><code>openssl rsa -pubin -in pub.pem -out pub.der -outform der # any version
openssl pkey -pubin -in pub.pem -out pub.der -outform der # 1.0.0 up
</code></pre>

<p>and then read the DER file with no change at all into an <code>X509EncodedKeySpec</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Bypass 2:</strong> if you have the <strong>private key</strong>, and it is NOT OpenSSH's 'new' format (optional since 6.5 (edit) and <em>default</em> since 7.8), and you have OpenSSL, get the public key in SPKI (Java-friendly) format with one of</p>

<pre><code>openssl rsa -in id_rsa -pubout -out pub.pem # default PEM
openssl rsa -in id_rsa -pubout -out pub.der -outform der # DER

<p>Try to send the <code>y</code> to plink using the <code>strw.WriteLine(...);</code>  you already have in place or create a <code>yes.txt</code> file in which you put a single <code>y</code> and have plink read its content with <code>plink &lt; yes.txt</code>.</p>

<p>Anyway, your piping syntax does not work on its own, because it's <code>cmd.exe</code> that understands it only, so you would have to run it like:</p>

</ol>

<p>So, do not wait.</p>

<p>We do not know, what you application purpose is.</p>

<p>If just to open the tunnel, then make it wait (for a key press?) indefinitely, to keep the tunnel open.</p>

<p>If the application is going to use the tunnel, then just carry on with the other tasks, without closing the SSH session.</p>

<p>You should better use a native .NET SSH library for the tunnel, then using an external application.</p>

<p><strong>FIRST PROBLEM</strong></p>

<p>The first problem I am facing is accepting RSA key automatically, whitch I can do running</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>echo y |plink.exe -ssh -N -D 9999 user@1.2.3.4 -pw user -v
</code></pre>

<p>but it turns out that I get an error when I use <code>echo y |</code> at <code>Process p = Process.Start(psi);</code> line where <code>psi</code> variable is ok. I know how to put arguments after with <code>Arguments = String.Format(""-ssh -N -D 9999 user@1.2.3.4 -pw user -v""),</code> but i don't know how to put them in front of the command.</p>

<p><strong>SECOND PROBLEM</strong></p>

<p>The second problem is that I don't want to wait for the content because when I am creating the tunnel it says nothing, just waiting. I just want to open a SSH tunnel in background on <code>127.0.0.1:9999</code>, that's all.</p>

<p>What do I have to change?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I'm trying to export a public key from a x509certificate2 object in PEM format in c# code.</p>

<p>As far as I understand, the difference between a certificate in cer format vs pem format, is only the header and footer
(if I understand correctly, a certificate in .cer format in base 64 should be someBase64String and in pem format it's the same string including the begin and end header and footer).</p>

<p>but my question is for the public key.
let pubKey be a public key exported in .cer format from an x509certificate2 object,
is the pem format of this key, will be:</p>

<pre><code>------BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
pubKey...
------END PUBLIC KEY------
</code></pre>

<p>encoded in base 64?</p>

<p>Thanks :)</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>for the public key. let pubKey be a public key exported in .cer format from an x509certificate2 object</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Talking about a "".cer format"" only applies when you have the whole certificate; and that's all that an X509Certificate2 will export as. (Well, or a collection of certificates, or a collection of certificates with associated private keys).</p>

<p>Nothing built in to .NET will give you the DER-encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo block of the certificate, which is what becomes ""PUBLIC KEY"" under a PEM encoding.</p>

<p>You can build the data yourself, if you want.  For RSA it's not too bad, though not entirely pleasant.  The data format is defined in <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3280#section-4.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3280#section-4.1</a>:</p>

<pre><code>SubjectPublicKeyInfo  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
    algorithm            AlgorithmIdentifier,
    subjectPublicKey     BIT STRING  }

AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
    algorithm               OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
    parameters              ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL  }
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3279#section-2.3.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3279#section-2.3.1</a> describes how RSA keys, in particular are to be encoded:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rsaEncryption OID is intended to be used in the algorithm field
     of a value of type AlgorithmIdentifier.  The parameters field MUST
     have ASN.1 type NULL for this algorithm identifier.</p>
  
  <p>The RSA public key MUST be encoded using the ASN.1 type RSAPublicKey:</p>

<pre><code>RSAPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
    modulus            INTEGER,    -- n
    publicExponent     INTEGER  }  -- e
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The language behind these structures is ASN.1, defined by <a href=""https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-X.680-201508-I!!PDF-E&amp;type=items"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ITU X.680</a>, and the way they get encoded to bytes is covered by the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) ruleset of <a href=""https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-X.690-201508-I!!PDF-E&amp;type=items"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ITU X.690</a>.</p>

<p>DSA and ECDSA keys have more complex values for AlgorithmIdentifier.parameters, but X509Certificate's GetKeyAlgorithmParameters() happens to give them back correctly formatted, so you would just need to write down their OID (string) lookup key and their OID (byte[]) encoded value in the switch statement.</p>

<p>My SEQUENCE and BIT STRING builders can definitely be more efficient (oh, look at all those poor arrays), but this would suffice for something that isn't perf-critical.</p>

<p>To check your results, you can paste the output to <code>openssl rsa -pubin -text -noout</code>, and if it prints anything other than an error you've made a legally encoded ""PUBLIC KEY"" encoding for an RSA key.</p>

<p><code>ssh</code> doesn't accept a port number as part of either the <code>Host</code> or <code>Hostname</code> options here. As a result, it's not recognizing that this entry should apply to your connection attempts, and it's not applying the identity file or user.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>This runs the <code>test</code> command to test the port value. ""%p"" will be replaced by the port value that ssh would use up to that point (either the default of 22 or the value from the command line). test is also known as [; it's a command-line utility mostly used in shell scripts as part of an if statement.</p>

","<p>You don't have to distribute the certificate. One of common approaches is to include the certificate in the signed document, in the <code>KeyInfo/X509Data</code> node.</p>

<p>The validation can use the embedded certificate easily and the only required infrastructure element at the client side is the certificate thumbprint and subject name. In other words, client validates the document using included certificate and then easily checks the certificate agaist the subject name and thumbprint. In case of a match, there is the assumption that a correct certificate has been provided.</p>

<p>Read more about technical details in one of my blog entries (this is a 3 part tutorial so you can also take a look at all other entries). Anyway, no importing certificates and no including certificates with your software, rather you have two string configuration parameters.</p>

<p>The embedded certificate inside the XmlDsigned document has a const size and usually the overhead is neglectable.</p>

<p>This is my public and private key generated.</p>
","<p>The <em>RSA</em> private key includes the values that are in the <em>RSA</em> public key, and some more values that are <em>private</em>. Futhermore, the values themselves are larger.</p>

<p>The public key contains the modulus and the public exponent <em>e</em> which is short (mostly 3 or 65537). On the other hand the private key contains the private exponent <em>d</em> ≡ <em>e</em><sup>−1</sup> (mod φ(<em>n</em>)). Depending on φ(<em>n</em>), <em>d</em> can be vastly larger than <em>e</em>.</p>

<p>There are other public key algorithms where this is different. Some algorithms based on elliptic curves have a single big integer as the private key (and group description) and the public key has a curve point (and group description) which is larger than the big integer.</p>

  <p>why private key are often (are always, i don't know) longer than public key ? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer is detailed in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_1"" rel=""nofollow"">PKCS 1</a> (and friends like <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2437.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">RFC 2437</a>).</p>

<p>The public key is the pair <code>{e, n}</code>, where <code>e</code> is the public exponent and <code>n</code> is the modulus.</p>

<p>One of the private key representations is the triplet <code>{e, d, n}</code>, where <code>e</code> is the public exponent, <code>d</code> is the private exponent and <code>n</code> is the modulus.</p>

<p>The other private key representations the n-tuple<code>{e, d, n, p, q, dp, dq, qi}</code>, where <code>e</code> is the public exponent; <code>d</code> is the private exponent; <code>n</code> is the modulus; and <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> are the factors of <code>n</code>.</p>

<p>And the remaining are for the Chinese Remainder theorem, which allows a speedup in signatures (I believe). <code>dp</code> is p's exponent, a positive integer such that <code>e(dP) ≅ 1 (mod(p-1))</code>; <code>dq</code> is q's exponent, a positive integer such that <code>e(dq) ≅ 1 (mod(q-1))</code>; and <code>qi</code> is CRT coefficient, a positive integer less than <code>p</code> such that <code>q(qInv) ≅ 1 (mod p)</code>.</p>

","<p>The problem is not Gitosis itself, but that your SSH key gets rejected. This can be because it has not been authorized (is not in <em>gituser</em>’s <code>authorized_keys</code> file), because your SSH server is configured not to accept public keys, because your SSH key is weak or because you are not sending one at all.</p>

<p>Have a look at the logs of your SSH server to see whether (and why) your public key is rejected. On Ubuntu, the file should be located at <code>/var/log/auth.log</code>. Look for the word <em>publickey</em> and/or try cloning your repository to see what happens in the log file. You can use something like <code>sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log</code> to watch new entries as they arrive.</p>

without being able to see the rest of your code, I can say a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li>make sure that all of the classes that you are trying to serialize/deserialize implement Serializable.</li>
<li>If you can't do number 1, then you might try getting an encoded form of the Key object, such as <code>key.getEcnoded()</code>, which would allow you to do input/output using the bytes of the key.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
I'm not really familiar with JBoss, but maybe try using JBossObjectInputStream and JBossObjectOutputStream (org.jboss.serial.io). You will also have to add jboss-serialization.jar to your classpath. see <a href=""http://www.jboss.org/serialization"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a></p>

<p>also, I've never done this sort of thing before, but if you think the jar file is complicating things, but you should be able to use some of the classes in the <code>java.util.jar</code> package to simplify IO operations with jar files.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: I replaced ECB with CBC and hope its correct...</strong></p>
","<p>You are not getting the public key with <code>openssl_pkey_get_details()</code>. That structure contains both the public exponent <code>e</code> and private exponent <code>d</code>. It is normal that the private key also contains the public exponent. Most of the time that is a static value (such as 65537, the fourth number of Fermat).</p>

<p>According to the documentation of <code>openssl_pkey_new</code> you can get to the public key using the method <code>openssl_pkey_new()</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>openssl_pkey_new() generates a new private and public key pair. The public component of the key can be obtained using openssl_pkey_get_public().</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's not the only thing that goes wrong though:</p>

<ol>
<li>You are not using AES. Rijndael with a <em>block size</em> of 256 is not AES. AES has a block size of 128 bits.</li>
<li>Although <code>mcrypt</code> always expects an IV, ECB mode does not - but read on.</li>
<li>ECB mode is not secure for anything other than random data, you should be using CBC mode to encrypt asymmetric keys (as they almost always contain a structure that may leak information); CBC mode does require a random IV.</li>
<li>You are using the ASCII representation of a string instead of an AES key; you should use a Password Based Key Derivation function such as PBKDF2, bcrypt or scrypt instead. PHP <code>mcrypt</code> is far too forgiving regarding insecure keys.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that in general I would also advise a padding mode such as PKCS#7. Mcrypt however does not implement any sane padding method, so you would have to implement that yourself.</p>

"10642989","What, if any ""screw it up permanently"" situations are there in the App Store certificate/key-pair code signing process?","<p>My company works with several other companies to handle their iPhone development needs, and in many cases the other companies already have some existing app(s) on the App Store. </p>

<p>We handle the App Store submission for them as well and in the situations where they do already have an existing app, their iOS Dev Center account already has a Distribution certificate created. In which case we have to acquire the key pair that was generated when they (or the third party developer they hired) created the certificate. It's been my understanding this whole time that this is the necessary process in order to work with the App Store. </p>

<p>But as time goes on, I find myself wondering about several things</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What happens when the certificates expire? I know we create new ones but that means that the apps on the App Store are signed with a certificate/keypair different than the one they were created with. Is that significant? Or can I still update existing apps on the App Store even with a new certificate/keypair (from the same iOS Dev Center account)</p></li>
<li><p>What happens if the the keypair is lost for an existing certificate? Let's say the company made an app before but the Macintosh that they used prior was hit by a meteorite. And no backups of course. I'd have to revoke and recreate the certificate - would that mean anything for the existing published app? If I had the source code to that app and had to put out an update, would I be able to? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Basically I'm asking: are there any ""screw it up permanently"" scenarios involved with iOS development and distribution certificates that would keep you from being able to update existing apps? I know that if you don't backup the keystore in Android development then you're just hosed with regards to publishing updates but is there any way to just completely screw up with iOS development?</p>

<p>And a bonus question: If I can just revoke development certificates and re-issue them without consequence, has it always worked this way? Or have they modified the process? I can see where the ""chain of evidence"" could always be tied to the iOS Dev Center Agent account and that would be the root of things, but is this a new thing?</p>
","<p>A Distribution certificate is used only for submission to iTunes Connect (and Ad Hoc stuff).  Once approved, Apple signs the app with a different non-expiring certificate before putting the app in the App store, so the state of the developer's Distribution certificate no longer matters.  </p>

<p>A downloaded or purchased app will stay running on a customer's device even if the developer's certificates and iOS enrollment expires.  But a developer does have to re-enroll ($99/annum) in time if they want their app to stay visible in the App store.</p>

<p>Typically, Distribution certificates expire annually, maybe a bit more often, new ones can be created, and an updates for existing apps can just be submitted with the newest (and valid) Distribution certificate.</p>

<p>If you lose a key pair, the team leader will have to revoke and the generate new certificates and provisions, and update all their Keychains and Xcode provisioning and possibly project/target settings as well.  Confusion about which certificates and provisions are live and which are dead has caused some developers some serious headaches.</p>

"39471872","JWT RS256: Is it safe to fetch public key over https?","<p>I'm signing JWT's using the RS256 algorithm. To verify those tokens on the client, I somehow need to access the public key.</p>

<p>Are there security concerns (spoofing, ...) when I set up an unprotected API route ('/api/certificate') that returns the certificate containing the public key. And do I need to take any extra security measurements?</p>
","<p>Several concepts are often mixed up, maybe not for you, but let me try to explain a few things in this answer.</p>

<p>Assymetric cryptography obviously needs a public and a private key, both are basically just numbers. The private key is kept secret, the public is, well, public, anybody can have it. When signing stuff, you use the private key to sign and then anybody can verify using the public key that the signature was made by somebody that had the corresponding private key (ie. you).</p>

<p>But the question is then how you distribute your public key, or in your jwt example, how clients get it. As you correctly pointed out in the question, simply downloading the public key over an insecure channel is not good enough as an attacker could replace it with his own, resulting in the attacker being able to sign tokens.</p>

<p>One solution to this could be getting it over https as you proposed, which practically means using a second set of public-private keypair (keys of the webserver) to secure sending the first one. The theoretical question is still the same btw, it's just inherently solved in the background for you: how does the browser know that the public key it receives from the server upon connection actually belongs to the server. There is no secure channel yet between them.</p>

<p>Enter certificates.</p>

<p><strong>A certificate is a document that essentially ties a public key to its owner, and that is excactly what you want.</strong> When a browser connects to a website, the server sends its public key <em>along with its certificate</em>, so that the browser can verify that the public key actually belongs to the server (the domain name in this case) that sent it. How that verifies it is beyond the scope of this post, the point is that the certificate is signed by another public key, the certificate to which may be signed by another public key, etc., and the chain is terminated by a list of so called trusted root certificates already set up for your computer and/or browser by your OS/browser vendor.</p>

<p><strong>And you too should verify the public key with the certificate the same way.</strong> You don't even need the burden of SSL (https) transport for this, verifying that a public key belongs to a particular subject is the main purpose of certificates.</p>

<p>So all you have to do is not just get the public key from the API, but get it along with its certificate. You are probably already doing this, bare public keys are very rarely used. You are most probably already receiving a pfx or cer or crt or whatever from the server. Depending on the technology stack that you are developing on, you can for sure use built in mechanisms to fully verify a certificate and make sure it's valid. Please don't implement your own validation though, as that's tricky business and quite hard to get right. If the certificate passes validation, you can trust that the public key you received from the API is authentic and belongs to whatever it claims to belong to. There may be caveats though (like for example make sure that beyond basic validation, you check a combination of fields from the certificate that others can't have).</p>

<p>As an additional security measure, you can also implement <em>certificate pinning</em> to make it even more secure against certain types of attacks by having a list of fingerprints for valid certificates in the client (less so in a browser client, but still the concept is the same).</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> (what fields to check in the certificate after it passed general validation of expiry, etc):</p>

<p>In the general case it depends on who signed the certificate and what kind of certificate it is.</p>

<p>A server certificate signed by a real certificate authority (CA) can only have the server domain as its common name (CN) field, a real CA won't normally sign anything else, and they also won't sign a certificate for yourdomain.com unless you can prove you control yourdomain.com. So in this case it may be enough to check CN after the cert passed validation. You do need to check CN though, as anybody can have a valid certificate from say GlobalSign or Thawte or other trusted CAs, it just costs money. What they can't have is a certificate for yourdomain.com.</p>

<p>If you sign your own certificates, you also won't sign anything for anyone, so in that case it could be enough to check the issuer (that you signed it) and the CN (for whom). If the certificate otherwise passed validation (meaning a trusted root certificate signed it) it should be ok, as an attacker won't normally be able to have his CA certificate as trusted on your computer.</p>

<p>The point in general is that you want to check something that others can't have. It's easier, if you are relying on real CAs, and it's usually best to check the fingerprint.</p>

But I was wondering how I would generate those keys just in Java. I have tried countless times but encryption is so hard to understand for me and to work with. So I have no code to show at the moment, how would I start this or if anyone has a good method for doing so. I don't mind using bouncy castle if it is possible.</p>

<p>TL;DR: I would like to generate a unique Private and Public key in the correct format (PKCS#8, DER) using java (with or without a public library).</p>

<p>Just need these commands in java (not running through OpenSSL):</p>

<p>To generate a private key of length 2048 bits:</p>

<pre><code>openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
</code></pre>

<p>To get it into the required (PKCS#8, DER) format:</p>

<pre><code>openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -in private.pem -outform DER -out private.der -nocrypt
</code></pre>

<p>To generate a public key from the private key:</p>

<pre><code>openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -outform DER -out public.der
</code></pre>
","<p>Generating an RSA keypair is easy in Java. For example:</p>

<pre><code>import java.security.*;
import java.security.interfaces.*;

public class RSACreate {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        KeyPairGenerator kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"");
        kpg.initialize(2048, new SecureRandom());
        KeyPair kp = kpg.generateKeyPair();
        RSAPrivateCrtKey rsaPriv = (RSAPrivateCrtKey) kp.getPrivate();
        RSAPublicKey rsaPub = (RSAPublicKey) kp.getPublic();
    }

}

<p>Any idea?</p>
","<p>We ran into the exact same problem when connecting an iOS app to a Java backend. And the <a href=""https://github.com/DigitalLeaves/CryptoExportImportManager"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CryptoExportImportManager</a> mentioned by <em>pedrofb</em> helped us out too, which is awesome. However, the code in the <code>CryptoExportImportManager</code> class is a bit elaborated and might be hard to maintain. This is because a top-down approach is used when adding new components to the DER encoding. As a result, numbers contained by length fields must be calculated ahead (i.e. before the contents to which the length applies has been defined). I therefore created a new class that we now use to convert the DER encoding of an RSA public key:</p>



<pre class=""lang-swift prettyprint-override""><code>class RSAKeyEncoding: NSObject {

  // ASN.1 identifiers
  private let bitStringIdentifier: UInt8 = 0x03
  private let sequenceIdentifier: UInt8 = 0x30

  // ASN.1 AlgorithmIdentfier for RSA encryption: OID 1 2 840 113549 1 1 1 and NULL
  private let algorithmIdentifierForRSAEncryption: [UInt8] = [0x30, 0x0d, 0x06,
    0x09, 0x2a, 0x86, 0x48, 0x86, 0xf7, 0x0d, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x05, 0x00]

  /// Converts the DER encoding of an RSA public key that is either fetched from the
  /// keychain (e.g. by using `SecItemCopyMatching(_:_:)`) or retrieved in another way
  /// (e.g. by using `SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation(_:_:)`), to a format typically
  /// used by tools and programming languages outside the Apple ecosystem (such as
  /// OpenSSL, Java, PHP and Perl). The DER encoding of an RSA public key created by
  /// iOS is represented with the ASN.1 RSAPublicKey type as defined by PKCS #1.
  /// However, many systems outside the Apple ecosystem expect the DER encoding of a
  /// key to be represented with the ASN.1 SubjectPublicKeyInfo type as defined by
  /// X.509. The two types are related in a way that if the SubjectPublicKeyInfo’s
  /// algorithm field contains the rsaEncryption object identifier as defined by
  /// PKCS #1, the subjectPublicKey field shall contain the DER encoding of an
  /// RSAPublicKey type.
  ///
  /// - Parameter rsaPublicKeyData: A data object containing the DER encoding of an
  ///     RSA public key, which is represented with the ASN.1 RSAPublicKey type.
  /// - Returns: A data object containing the DER encoding of an RSA public key, which
  ///     is represented with the ASN.1 SubjectPublicKeyInfo type.
  func convertToX509EncodedKey(_ rsaPublicKeyData: Data) -&gt; Data {
    var derEncodedKeyBytes = [UInt8](rsaPublicKeyData)

    // Insert ASN.1 BIT STRING bytes at the beginning of the array
    derEncodedKeyBytes.insert(0x00, at: 0)
    derEncodedKeyBytes.insert(contentsOf: lengthField(of: derEncodedKeyBytes), at: 0)
    derEncodedKeyBytes.insert(bitStringIdentifier, at: 0)

    // Insert ASN.1 AlgorithmIdentifier bytes at the beginning of the array
    derEncodedKeyBytes.insert(contentsOf: algorithmIdentifierForRSAEncryption, at: 0)

    // Insert ASN.1 SEQUENCE bytes at the beginning of the array
    derEncodedKeyBytes.insert(contentsOf: lengthField(of: derEncodedKeyBytes), at: 0)
    derEncodedKeyBytes.insert(sequenceIdentifier, at: 0)

    return Data(derEncodedKeyBytes)
  }

  private func lengthField(of valueField: [UInt8]) -&gt; [UInt8] {
    var length = valueField.count

    if length &lt; 128 {
      return [ UInt8(length) ]
    }

    // Number of bytes needed to encode the length
    let lengthBytesCount = Int((log2(Double(length)) / 8) + 1)

    // First byte encodes the number of remaining bytes in this field
    let firstLengthFieldByte = UInt8(128 + lengthBytesCount)

    var lengthField: [UInt8] = []
    for _ in 0..&lt;lengthBytesCount {
      // Take the last 8 bits of length
      let lengthByte = UInt8(length &amp; 0xff)
      // Insert them at the beginning of the array
      lengthField.insert(lengthByte, at: 0)
      // Delete the last 8 bits of length
      length = length &gt;&gt; 8
    }

    // Insert firstLengthFieldByte at the beginning of the array
    lengthField.insert(firstLengthFieldByte, at: 0)

    return lengthField
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>You could use this class in the function <code>asBase64()</code> like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-swift prettyprint-override""><code>extension SecKey {
  func asBase64() throws -&gt; String {
    var dataPtr: CFTypeRef?
    let query: [String:Any] = [
      kSecClass as String: kSecClassKey,
      kSecAttrApplicationTag as String: ""..."", // Same unique tag here
      kSecAttrKeyType as String: kSecAttrKeyTypeRSA,
      kSecReturnData as String: kCFBooleanTrue
    ]
    let result = SecItemCopyMatching(query as CFDictionary, &amp;dataPtr)

    switch (result, dataPtr) {
    case (errSecSuccess, .some(let data)):

      // convert to X509 encoded key
      let convertedData = RSAKeyEncoding().convertToX509EncodedKey(data)

      // convert to Base64 string
      let base64PublicKey = convertedData.base64EncodedString(options: [])
      return base64PublicKey
    default:
      throw CryptoError.keyConversionError
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>UPDATE - Other Issue</h2>

<p>After using the above class for a while, we stumbled upon another issue. Occasionally, the public key that is fetched from the keychain seems to be invalid because, for some reason, it has grown in size. This behavior matches with findings described in the question (although in our case the Base64 encoded key has grown to a size of 392 characters instead of 360 characters). Unfortunately, we didn’t find the exact cause of this strange behavior, but we found two solutions. The first solution is to specify <code>kSecAttrKeySizeInBits</code> along with <code>kSecAttrEffectiveKeySize</code> when defining the query, like in the below code snippet:</p>

<pre class=""lang-swift prettyprint-override""><code>let keySize = ... // Key size specified when storing the key, for example: 2048

let query: [String: Any] = [
    kSecAttrKeySizeInBits as String: keySize,
    kSecAttrEffectiveKeySize as String: keySize,
    ... // More attributes
]

var dataPtr: CFTypeRef?

let result = SecItemCopyMatching(query as CFDictionary, &amp;dataPtr)
</code></pre>

<p>The second solution is to always delete the old key from the keychain (if any) before adding a new key with the same tag.</p>

<h2>UPDATE - Alternative Solution</h2>

<p>I published <a href=""https://github.com/nextincrement/rsa-public-key-importer-exporter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this project</a> on GitHub that can be used as an alternative to the above class.</p>

<p>i generated an ssh private key earlier and added it, seemingly without incident. can you tell what is going wrong? can someone list simple, incremental steps on the natural order of the environment that makes this thing work?</p>

<p>i know there are other posts for this, i have read through them, and tried the collective things recommended. even if you could just point me to a post where things are sequentially laid out i could read that. any help, many thanks!!</p>
","<p>If git remote origin does show you an ssh url like <code>git@aserver:auser/arepo</code>, do test:</p>

<pre><code>ssh -Tv git@aserver

<p>You will see <em>where</em> ssh is looking for the public/private key. 
It should typically be <code>%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_rsa</code></p>

<p>I guess that it is a #PCKS1 base64 encoded key but I am not sure and I don't know how to generate a similar one in Android - Androids standard is #PCKS8. However I would prefer not to include spongy castle in my project if there is a way around.</p>
","<p>You are in luck; it seems you only have to PEM encode your public key as both Java and OpenSSL use the same <code>SubjectPublicKey</code> structure used for X5.09 certificates. You can get to this by running <code>RSAPublicKey.encode()</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I don't know any other library that performs PEM encoding, but I'm sure you can strip out the code from Bouncy or Spongy if required; the Bouncy Castle libraries have a very liberal licensing structure.</p>

<p>How can I prevent Capistrano to scrumble up my SSH settings and make it use public key auth again?</p>

","<p>Not only <em>can</em> you use a public key for encryption, that is actually the normal mode of operation when you are encrypting for secrecy.  This makes sense - anyone can encrypt with the public key, and only the proper recipient can decrypt using their private key.</p>

<p>In many public key systems, signing is mathematically similar to the opposite case - ""encrypting with the private key"" - but note that the signing operation is fundamentally distinct from the encryption operation.  For example, with RSA, signing must use an invariant, verifiable padding method, whereas encryption should use random padding.</p>

","<p><em>Encryption</em> is about keeping some data confidential; the data is transformed into an opaque blob and the reverse operation requires something that the attacker does not know, i.e. a ""secret"" or ""private"" information. The whole point of encryption is that <em>decryption</em> cannot be done with only public information; hence decryption uses the private key. However, there is no problem in letting anybody encrypt data, thus encryption can use the public key.</p>

<p>There are some algorithms (in practice, only one: RSA) which, from a casual glance, appear to be ""revertible"": you might think about using the private key for encryption, and the public key for decryption. As explained above, there goes confidentiality (if the decryption key is public, then anybody can decrypt, hence the encrypted data cannot be considered as confidential anymore). Such a ""reversed encryption"" may be used as the basis for a <em>digital signature algorithm</em>, in which there is no notion of confidentiality, but, instead, of verifiable proof of key owner action.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong> there is more to RSA than the modular exponentiation. RSA encryption first transforms the input message into a big integer through an operation called ""padding"". RSA signature generation first transforms the input message into a big integer through another operation which is also called ""padding""; <strong>but</strong> this is not <em>at all</em> the same padding. Padding is essential for security, and the needed characteristics are quite distinct between encryption and signature. For instance, an encryption padding needs a high level of added randomness, whereas a signature padding requires a lot of redundancy (and a hash function, in order to accommodate long input messages).</p>

<p>Talking of signatures as ""encryption with the private key"" is the way the RSA standard historically put it (hence names such as ""md5WithRSAEncryption""), but it is inaccurate (paddings are, and must be, different) and overly specific (it applies only to RSA, not El Gamal, DSA, Diffie-Hellman, NTRU...). This is just a widespread confusion.</p>

","<p>Here is the reason why it didn't work. As numerous step-by-step tutorials suggest, one should generate the public key file, copy it to the server and then append the public key to the authorized_keys file with the cat command like this:</p>

<p><code>cat id_rsa.mypublickey.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code></p>

<p>Im my case I used PuTTYgen to generate the keys. But the resulting public key file (the one thats saved when you use the save button) was not syntactically applicable for appending to authorized_keys.</p>

<p>To get a correct formatted <strong>public key</strong> string, copy&amp;paste the generated snippet from the PuTTYgen window to <strong>one new line</strong>  in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. A correct formatted line looks like this, however, the syntax allows comments and more, too:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaEAAAAB/*...more letters...*/cPogeHB2XQBQ== rsa-key-20170831
</code></pre>

<p>To get the <strong>private key</strong> in a format that you can use with other ssh-agents  than Putty, you can use PuTTYgen's Conversion option and save the key in OpenSSH format. </p>

<p>As user ilansch suggested, more comprehensive information is found here: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2224066/how-to-convert-ssh-keypairs-generated-using-puttygenwindows-into-key-pairs-use"">How to convert SSH keypairs generated using PuttyGen(Windows) into key-pairs used by ssh-agent and KeyChain(Linux)</a></p>

<p>On server side I will encrypt a message using this public key and send the encrypted message to client , which the client decrypts using its private key.The algorithm agreed upon is 'RSA'.</p>

<p>The problem is on server side I am seeing that certain keys are working using <code>X509EncodedKeySpec</code> as key spec</p>

<p>While some keys throw exception (<code>Caused by: java.security.InvalidKeyException: IOException: algid parse error, not a sequence</code>) using <code>X509EncodedKeySpec</code> but work using <code>RSAPublicKeySpec</code>:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] publicBytes = Base64.decodeBase64(base64EncodedPubKey);
org.bouncycastle.asn1.pkcs.RSAPublicKey.RSAPublicKey pkcs1PublicKey = org.bouncycastle.asn1.pkcs.RSAPublicKey.RSAPublicKey.getInstance(publicBytes);

</code></pre>

<p>So, what I came to understand is that client and server need to agree whether to use:
<code>PKCS #1</code> or <code>X.509</code> for encoding the key . <strong>My question is which one is better for my use case?</strong> <strong>Any guidelines when to use which format?</strong></p>
","<p><strong>There's very little difference.</strong> The key format Java calls X.509, more exactly known as the ASN.1 structure <code>SubjectPublicKeyInfo</code> (or SPKI) defined in X.509 or equivalently and more conveniently in <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC5280 sec 4.1</a>, is a quite simple way to handle a large and flexible set of algorithms: it consists of a substructure <code>AlgorithmIdentifier</code> which identifies the algorithm and its parameters if applicable, then an opaque BIT STRING which contains the actual key information (encoded) in a format depending on (the algorithm identified by) the AlgorithmIdentifier. </p>

<p>For RSA, the algorithm-dependent part <em>is</em> the ASN.1 structure <code>RSAPublicKey</code> defined in PKCS1 or more conveniently <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8017#appendix-A.1.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC8017 appendix A.1.1</a> and its earlier versions, and duplicated in <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3279#section-2.3.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC3279 sec 2.3.1</a>. Thus for RSA the X.509 (SPKI) format <em>contains</em> the PKCS1 format, and since RSA doesn't have parameters (or at least key-related parameters), the only real difference is that the X.509 format explicitly specifies that the key is RSA -- which in your application you already know.</p>

<p>You have already discovered that vanilla (Oracle-was-Sun-now-OpenJDK) Java crypto, aka JCA Java Cryptographic Architecture, directly supports only the X.509 (SPKI) format, which is a minor advantage. However if you use BouncyCastle it is much easier to convert back and forth than the code in your Q; you simply use the <code>org.bouncycastle.asn1.x509.SubjectPublicKeyInfo</code> class to add or discard the AlgorithmIdentifier:</p>

<pre><code>    // test data source
    KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS""); ks.load (new FileInputStream (args[0]), args[1].toCharArray());
    byte[] spkienc = ks.getCertificate(args[2]).getPublicKey().getEncoded();
    System.out.println (DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(spkienc));

    // extract PKCS1 part of original SPKI
    byte[] pkcs1enc = SubjectPublicKeyInfo.getInstance(spkienc).parsePublicKey().getEncoded();
    System.out.println (DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(pkcs1enc));

    // rebuild SPKI from the PKCS1
    AlgorithmIdentifier algid = new AlgorithmIdentifier(PKCSObjectIdentifiers.rsaEncryption, DERNull.INSTANCE);
    byte[] spki2enc = new SubjectPublicKeyInfo (algid, pkcs1enc).getEncoded();
    System.out.println (DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(spki2enc));

<p>If you don't have BouncyCastle, it's a little harder; you need to write a partial ASN.1 parser or generator. Full ASN.1 processing is rather complicated, but for this case you need only a small subset that isn't too bad. (Yeah, that's faint praise.) I may add this later if I have more time. </p>

<p><strong>A much bigger potential issue is that your key is not authenticated.</strong> The hard part of public key distribution, much harder than tiny format details, is making sure that <em>only</em> the legitimate key is distributed. If an attacker can substitute their publickey for the correct one, then the victim encrypts the supposedly secret data in a way the attacker can easily read, and all your fancy cryptography code is completely worthless.</p>

<p>This is why most actual systems don't distribute bare publickeys, but instead certificates that allow verifying the key is the correct key. There are a few certificate schemes, but the most widespread by far is X.509 and its Internet profile PKIX -- in fact the RFCs I referenced above, 5280 and 3279, are part of PKIX. SSL-now-TLS uses X.509. Code-signing uses X.509. S/MIME email uses X.509. (PGP/GPG uses a different kind of certificates, not X.509, but still certificates.) And (vanilla) Java directly supports X.509 certificates just as well or even better than it does ""X.509"" (SPKI) publickeys.</p>

<p>It sounds like you are looking for a Probabilistic Signature Scheme with Recovery (PSSR). That way, you can extract the message from the signature after verifying the message is authentic.</p>

<p>If not, you should probably use a well established protocol like IPSec or SSL/TLS to set up a secure channel and tunnel your traffic through it. Its usually a good idea to use something that's well established; and its usually a bad idea to design your own protocols.</p>

<p>How do I make sure I get the same format in both cases, so I can compare easily?</p>
","<p>The answer of Jakuje will allow you to compare hashes, but it forces you to keep on using MD5 hashes for verification. MD5 has been shown vulnerable to collision attacks, making it a poor choice for fingerprint verification.</p>

<p>A more secure approach is to generate the SHA256 fingerprint on the server by hand. You can do this by typing:</p>

<pre><code>awk '{print $2}' /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub | base64 -d | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}' | xxd -r -p | base64 | rev | cut -c 2- | rev

</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone know how to solve this error?</p>
","<p>It turned out to be a couple of issues. Here is what I learned along the way:</p>

<p>The tx json data that is used to build the prev_tx object needs to have a output value as a string. Some sites use a number instead.</p>

<p>The key object sometimes doesn't form correctly. For whatever reason, I have an address which can only be generated using the private key with Bitcoin::Key.new. If you supply a private and public key the address associated with the key object is wrong. For different addresses, this isn't the case. So it is important to check the address of the key object after generating the object. </p>

<p>It is also important to make sure the addresses / keys generated on testnet3 are only used with one another. I had a situation where I thought I generated a testnet3 private key, but didn't. Thus, the testnet3 tx wasn't working. And vice versa for the normal bitcoin network.</p>

<p>Lastly, it's very important to verify the output address position. It is usually 0 or 1, but this isn't always the case...</p>

<p>If you want to give someone your signed message, you give them the clear-text message and the signature. They can then use your public key to validate the signature. The signature is based on a digest of the message and your private key. The validation step computes the digest of the message and validates the signature of the digest with the public key. If either the public key doesn't correspond to the private key used in the signature, or if the message digest doesn't match, then the signature is detected as invalid.</p>

<p>My <code>mvn</code> command line looks like:</p>

<pre><code>--batch-mode  release:clean release:prepare release:perform  
-s /home/[YYYY]/.m2/deploy-settings.xml 
-Dsettings.security=/home/[YYYY]/.m2/master-settings.xml 
</code></pre>

<p>When I tried the above configuration it failed.  It could not commit the modified POM file to SVN.  To help debug this problem, I set the following environment variable:</p>

<pre><code>SVN_SSH=""ssh -vvv""
</code></pre>

<p>When I did this, I saw in the debug statements too many authentication failures with a username other than the <code>[XXXX]</code> username defined in the <code>&lt;server&gt;</code> tag.</p>

<p>So then I tried to specify the username in the command line:</p>

<pre><code>--batch-mode -Dusername=[XXXX] release:clean release:prepare release:perform...
</code></pre>

<p>That didn't work.</p>

<p>So then I tried to specify the username in the POM:</p>

<pre><code>scm:svn:svn+ssh://[XXXX]@my.server.org/data1/svns_zzzz/zzzz/path/to/the/project/trunk
</code></pre>

<p>That didn't work either.</p>

<p>To debug and verify my <code>[XXXX]</code> username and <code>/home/[YYYY]/.ssh/id_rsa</code> key did in fact work, I added them to the environment variable:</p>

<pre><code>SVN_SSH=""ssh -vvv -l [XXXX] -i /home/[YYYY]/.ssh/id_rsa""
</code></pre>

<p>After setting the environment variable like this, it worked.  The release plugin was able to successfully commit the modified POM file to SVN.  So I know the username and password work.  </p>

<p>So now the question is what is wrong with my Maven configuration?  Setting the SVN_SSH environment variable helped diagnose the problem, and provides a work-around but I don't want to leave it as a long-term solution.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>
","<p>The release plugin forks the build, and doesn't pass the arguments you provide on the command line to the forked process by default.  Try adding this: <code>-Darguments=""-s /home/[YYYY]/.m2/deploy-settings.xml -Dsettings.security=/home/[YYYY]/.m2/master-settings.xml""</code> (note double quotes) to the current command line.  This should pass the changes to the forked processes.</p>

but, for that message, sshd will just check if the given publickey blob exists in <strong>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</strong> file.  If it exists in that file, ssh client will receive SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK .</p>

Would it be normal practice to pass the clients public key to the server, as part of initial session? As its the public key, when the session starts up, the initial clp command, would pass the key, along with other salient details that the server needs to know about the client. It's the public, so it doesn't need to be encrypted, it public.</p>

<p>The client/server communication is secured with ssl/tls. </p>

<p>Thanks.
 Bob.</p>
","<p>Don't you trust SSL/TLS or why do you encrypt again within the secure channel? That only makes sense if the server will pass the message on to other nodes and it will be decrypted somewhere else, thereby creating end-to-end security.</p>

<p>In any case, you should not have the client pass just the public key to the server. Instead it should pass a <em>certificate</em> to the server, which should authenticate the client based on a signature made with the private key matching the public key contained in the certificate. Also, the server will need to check the certificate itself (is it from a trusted CA, do the signatures in the chain verify, etc.).</p>

<p>If you can, you should do all this on the SSL/TLS layer by using SSL/TLS mutual authentication (client cert authentication). If you cannot, then make sure you design a secure application layer protocol for authenticating the client and it's public key. Otherwise it may be possible to impersonate other clients.</p>

"11239501","Which decryption uses a binary public key with variable length?","<p>I have a program which is obviously decrypting its data with a public, binary key of variable length.</p>

<p>I came to these facts by doing some more or less educated guesses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reverse Engineering revealed that the program needs the name of a file including a public key</li>
<li>Viewing this file in a hex editor shows totally random binary data (with no interesting pattern or anything), prefixed with the length of the file - in one version the file is only 200 bytes long, in another about 2000 bytes.</li>
<li>Thinking about the security, I guess the programs company encrypts the data files with a private key so that noone can create their own data files (which would fit the programs needs - no ""modding"" should be allowed nor the data be shown in third party programs).</li>
<li>The data files are prefixed with a human readable 64 byte long header, the rest is again completely random binary data.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd like to use the same system for my own program, if such thing is available.
Is there an encryption method capable of asymmetric encryption / decryption with a binary key of variable length, if yes, which one and how can I implement such thing?</p>
","<p>That's not the way to proceed. You can use a fixed length key for variable length data. As asymmetric crypto is pretty slow, the usual method is to generate a random symmetric secret key (say, a 128 bit AES key) and encrypt the data using e.g. CBC. Then the symmetric key is encrypted by an asymmetric public key, say RSA 2048 bits. Decryption means decrypting the secret key using the private key, then decrypting the data with the data specific secret key.</p>

<p>If you don't know how to do this you can use a library capable of creating CMS (cryptographic message syntax) to perform this scheme.</p>

<p>Note: a 2000 byte asymmetric key pair would take forever to encrypt something, even if you could create a key pair of that size.</p>

<p>If you really don't want the encryption of the ""whole connection"" (and I would strongly encourage you to reconsider that since it is basically free) you can use on the NULL cipher suites with the SSL connection.

<p>For <code>M2Crypto</code> I referred this <a href=""http://www.php2python.com/wiki/function.openssl-public-encrypt/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a>, but <code>RSA.load_pub_key_bio(bio)</code> line of code gives error.</p>

<p>Any help is really appreciated. Thank you.</p>
","<p>You can do this with the <a href=""https://cryptography.io/en/latest/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cryptography</a> library's hazmat layer (note that cryptography is now the back-end library used by pyOpenSSL; while pyOpenSSL is convenient for some uses, cryptography provides a much more complete OpenSSL binding as well as useful higher-level (safer, better) cryptographic primitives and bindings to other cryptographic libraries as well).  Before you do, note that it's very easy to shoot yourself in the foot with the hazmat layer and the cryptography team won't apologize if you do.</p>

<p>You should be sure you understand what's going with these operations before you rely on the code to provide any kind of security.  Also, if you control the full stack - from encryption to decryption - <em>stop</em> doing it this way.  Use something like PGP instead.</p>

","<p>In cryptography, the devil is in the details, like what really is meant by:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>remaining XML (without ""s"" tag)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are lucky: this ridiculously vague specification <strike>comes</strike> came with a <a href=""https://uidai.gov.in/images/offlineaadhaar20181115055017542.xml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sample XML file</a> and matching <a href=""https://uidai.gov.in/images/okyc-publickey.cer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">certificate</a>, allowing to:</p>

<ul>
<li>extract the signature signature field (converted from Base64 to binary) from the former to get <em>S</em>;</li>
<li>extract <em>N</em> and <em>e</em> from the later;</li>
<li>compute <em>V</em> = <em>S</em><sup> <em>e</em></sup> mod <em>N</em></li>
<li>check that <em>V</em> is indeed formatted per SHA256withRSA (also known as <a href=""https://www.emc.com/collateral/white-papers/h11300-pkcs-1v2-2-rsa-cryptography-standard-wp.pdf#page=31"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5</a> with SHA-256 hash),</li>
<li>on the right of <em>V</em> after a fixed DER prefix <code>3031300d060960864801650304020105000420</code> characteristic of a Digestinfo with SHA-256 we extract the 32-byte value <code>f4efef8c788058df45385ec65a49e92f806b9ffd6fc6d11b4f3c2cf89a81fe2f</code>, which thus is the expected hash for that example's signed data.</li>
</ul>

<p>So with a little trial and error we find what that signed data really is. We want to start from XML file and remove</p>

<ol>
<li>the <code>s</code> tag</li>
<li>its <code>=</code> (and, should there be any, whitespace between former <code>s</code> tag and <code>=</code>, and after <code>=</code> as allowed by the XML syntax)</li>
<li>its value field including leading and closing <code>""</code> (which contains the base64-encoded signature)</li>
<li><strong>precisely two nearby space characters</strong>, like the one before the <code>s</code> tag and the one after the closing <code>""</code> (alternatively, we might want to leave a single space where there are now several, probably three after the removals in bullet points 1-3).</li>
</ol>

<p>then hash what remains including <code>&lt; /&gt;</code> delimiters (as UTF-8), that is in the sample code pass it to <code>BlockUpdate</code> or <code>verify_update</code>. For that example:</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>To understand this question, its best to know a little about asymmetric encryption. In asymmetric encryption, you have a public key and a private key. Together they make a ""keypair."" The public key is used to encrypt. The private key is then used to decrypt. Note the private key can only decrypt files that were encrypted with the matching public key.</p>

<p>So now we know that there are 2 files needed to make everything work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can I just copy my private key from this computer among my other computers to connect to >the servers, or do I have to generate private keys on each computer and then authorize >their public keys on each server?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer simply is, yes. You can copy the public or private key to any computer and use it with any OS. As long as you have the public key, you can encrypt messages. If you have the private key, then you can decrypt those files afterwards. Its just a matter of the files being present on the computer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If not, is there a better way to do it (that would save me some time)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While theres no technical reason you cant copy and reuse the same keypair everytime, this is not a good practice in terms of security. For example, if you have a forest of 100 servers all sharing the same keypair, if 1 is compromised or hacked, the rest of the 99 servers are also compromised.

","<p>I agree with datasage's answer. Another way to get access is to create an AMI image of the current instance and then launch a new instance from that image. When you launch the new instance, you will have the option to create a new key pair or to use an existing one.</p>

<p>Once you can connect to the new instance, you can reassign the Elastic IP (if any) of the old instance to the new one and just terminate the old instance.</p>

","<p>The figure has several errors and some omissions, because it is probably a simplification:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the hash is <strong>digitally signed, not encrypted</strong>, and the signature is verified, not decrypted. The underlying cryptographic operation is not equivalent.</p></li>
<li><p>the signed data should include the certificate and <strong>the certification chain</strong></p></li>
<li><p>if you use a known format like CMS, pkcs#7 or XMLDsig the hash to sign usually includes also a  reference to the signing certificate and content-type to avoid tampering</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To validate a signed document you <strong>verify the signature using the public key of the attached certificate</strong> but it is mandatory to <strong>check that the signing certificate is trusted verifying that the certificate itself or the issuing Certification Authority is present in the client's trustore</strong>. </p>

<p>The signature includes the certification chain because usually the truststore does not contain the intermediate CAs. The certificates of the truststore are exchanged previously</p>

<p>Additionaly the verification process should check that the certificate is not expired and not revoked</p>

<p>The J2ME Midlet is shipped WITH the server's public key, on connect a message (username, password hash and random) is encrypted using that public key and sent to the server. The server then decrypts it and uses it to authenticate the client.</p>

<p>The main idea of the certificate authority is to say who is who, if the two parties know that already and agree that it won't change (unless through an already authenticated connection), then don't I bypass the need for one?</p>

","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but I think you are missing the point.  The program is shipped with the key, but there is no way of the user knowing that the program they're downloading actually came from you, and not some malicious hacker intercepting/rewriting the communication; all the user sees is bits coming in from a wire on the wall.</p>

<p>Typically what you'll do then is sign the jar with your key, and ship the key with your program.  Now we have a chicken-and-egg problem:  how do they know that the key came from you?</p>

<p>This is where the certificate authority comes in; the CA's key is <em>already</em> on their computer, so they leave it up to the CA to verify who you are and sign your public key.  Then when the user gets the public key, verifies that it was signed by the CA, and verifies that the jar was signed by the key, they <em>know</em> the key is yours and thus the jar must have come from you, since you are the only one who could have signed it with the private key.</p>

<p>Now, if your key were on their computer ahead of time (for instance, inside of a company where the keys are physically placed on the computers when they're being set up), they yes, you absolutely don't need to have the key signed.</p>

<p>Now, I know this is definetely not the correct way of using libgcrypt (as I am reading the entire key text as an MPI, and the decryption fails), but with the manual in front, I cannot find a way of reading the key... 
Should I do the parsing of the key manually?</p>

<p>I don't know how this key has been generated, I'm sorry. I have been told to take this key and verify the signature of another string that I'll call ""object"". I have been told that the algorithm that I have to use to verify ""object"" is SHA256withRSA.</p>

<p>So, I have written the following java method to read the key</p>

<pre><code>private PublicKey getPublicKey(String publicKey) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException, UnsupportedEncodingException {
    publicKey = publicKey.replaceAll(""\\n"", """");
    publicKey = publicKey.replace(""-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----"", """");
    publicKey = publicKey.replace(""-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----"", """");

    KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
    PublicKey pubKey = kf.generatePublic(publicSpec);
    return pubKey;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The point is that I get the following exception:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have read plenty of qustions as mine in stackoverflow. The code written by other users is pretty similar (sometimes identical) to mine. So I definitely don't get why it doesn't work for me. Other developers (workmates) are doing the same in php and it works great, so I would discard the hypothesis of wrong public key. Maybe didn't I understood the process clearly? Do you have any clue, please?</p>

<p>I have also tried to cope with the problem using BouncyCastle library, as suggested <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6559272/algid-parse-error-not-a-sequence"">here</a>, but I get the same exception. The following is the code I have written:</p>

<pre><code>private static PublicKey getPublicKey(String publicKey)
        throws IOException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException {
    Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());
    PemReader pp = new PemReader(new StringReader(publicKey));
    PemObject pem = pp.readPemObject();
    byte[] content = pem.getContent();
    pp.close();

    X509EncodedKeySpec spec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(content);
    KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
    return kf.generatePublic(spec);
}
</code></pre>
","<p>You can't load that key using an X509EncodedKeySpec. According to it's <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/security/spec/X509EncodedKeySpec.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JavaDoc documentation</a> it expects the following format:</p>

<p>As you may recognize your key does not contain an <code>AlgorithmIdentifier</code> therefore it can not be loaded using <code>X509EncodedKeySpec</code>. </p>

<p>My suggestion would be to use the BouncyCastle library and it's <code>PEMParser</code> class for loading this key:</p>

<pre><code>File pemFile = new File(""test.pem"");
try (PEMParser pp = new PEMParser(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(pemFile)))) {
    SubjectPublicKeyInfo subjPubKeyInfo = (SubjectPublicKeyInfo) pp.readObject();
    RSAKeyParameters rsa = (RSAKeyParameters) PublicKeyFactory.createKey(subjPubKeyInfo);

    RSAPublicKeySpec rsaSpec = new RSAPublicKeySpec(rsa.getModulus(), rsa.getExponent());
    KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
    java.security.PublicKey publicKey = kf.generatePublic(rsaSpec);
    System.out.println(publicKey);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or you manually convert the key to PKCS#8 format via openssl.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Using <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.rsacryptoserviceprovider(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>System.Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider</code></a> with 2048-bit keyword size to perform asymmetric encryption/decrpytion, initially following the example in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18850030/aes-256-encryption-public-and-private-key-how-can-i-generate-and-use-it-net"">this question, ""AES 256 Encryption: public and private key how can I generate and use it .net""</a>.</p>

<p>As a first implementation, this seems to work:</p>

<pre><code>public const int  CSPPARAMETERS_FLAG = 1;      // Specifies RSA: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms148034(v=vs.110).aspx
public const bool USE_OAEP_PADDING   = false;
public const int  KEYWORD_SIZE       = 2048;

public static byte[] Encrypt(byte[] publicKey, byte[] dataToEncrypt)
{
    var cspParameters = new System.Security.Cryptography.CspParameters(CSPPARAMETERS_FLAG);
    byte[] encryptedData = null;

    using (var rsaProvider = new System.Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider(cspParameters))
    {
        try
        {
            rsaProvider.PersistKeyInCsp = false;
            rsaProvider.ImportCspBlob(publicKey);
            encryptedData = rsaProvider.Encrypt(dataToEncrypt, USE_OAEP_PADDING);
        }
        finally
        {
            rsaProvider.PersistKeyInCsp = false;
            rsaProvider.Clear();
        }
    }
    return encryptedData;
}

public static byte[] Decrypt(byte[] privateKey, byte[] dataToDecrypt)
{
    var cspParameters = new System.Security.Cryptography.CspParameters(CSPPARAMETERS_FLAG);
    byte[] encryptedData = null;

    using (var rsaProvider = new System.Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider(cspParameters))
    {
        try
        {
            rsaProvider.PersistKeyInCsp = false;
            rsaProvider.ImportCspBlob(privateKey);
            encryptedData = rsaProvider.Decrypt(dataToDecrypt, USE_OAEP_PADDING);
        }
        finally
        {
            rsaProvider.PersistKeyInCsp = false;
            rsaProvider.Clear();
        }
    }

    return encryptedData;
}
</code></pre>

<p>After looking into these methods a bit more, it seems that the public key that I've been generating as from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18850030/aes-256-encryption-public-and-private-key-how-can-i-generate-and-use-it-net"">the example</a> seemed to have a lot of very predictable data at its start, and it was 276-bytes long.</p>

<p>Apparently <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.rsacryptoserviceprovider.exportcspblob(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>rsaProvider.ExportCspBlob(bool includePrivateParameters)</code></a> is a functional alternative to <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.rsacryptoserviceprovider.exportparameters(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>rsaProvider.ExportParameters(bool includePrivateParameters)</code></a>; the main difference is that the blob is already serialized as a <code>byte[]</code> while the other emits the object version, <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.rsaparameters(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>RSAParameters</code></a>.</p>

<p>Two observations about the methods:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>.Exponent</code> is always <code>0x010001</code>$=65537$.</li>
<li>The exported blobs contain 17 extra bytes versus the serialized typed versions.

<ul>
<li><code>rsaProvider.ExportCspBlob()</code>:

<ul>
<li>Public key is 276 bytes.</li>
<li>Private key is 1172 bytes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>RSAParameters</code>:

<ul>
<li>Public key is 259 bytes.

<ul>
<li><code>.Exponent.Length =   3</code></li>
<li><code>.Modulus .Length = 256</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Private key is 1155 bytes.

<ul>
<li><code>.D       .Length = 256</code></li>
<li><code>.DP      .Length = 128</code></li>
<li><code>.DQ      .Length = 128</code></li>
<li><code>.Exponent.Length =   3</code></li>
<li><code>.InverseQ.Length = 128</code></li>
<li><code>.Modulus .Length = 256</code></li>
<li><code>.P       .Length = 128</code></li>
<li><code>.Q       .Length = 128</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The extra 17 bytes appear to be at the header of the binary blob.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Concerns</h2>

<p>From this, two concerns:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it okay for the exponent to not be random?

<ul>
<li>If the exponent is defined as a constant, then it'd seem like that's another 3 bytes I could shave off the serialization?</li>
<li>Another question, <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/2335/should-rsa-public-exponent-be-only-in-3-5-17-257-or-65537-due-to-security-c"">Should RSA public exponent be only in {3, 5, 17, 257 or 65537} due to security considerations?</a>, seems to suggest that $\left{3, 5, 17, 257, 65537\right}$ are all common values for the exponent, so <code>0x101</code>$=65537$ seems reasonable if it's true that there's no harm in always using the same constant exponent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are the 17 extra bytes an information leak?

<ul>
<li>Do they represent the option parameters like key length and method?</li>
<li>Is it a good idea to be transmitting option parameter information when I already know that both the sender and receiver are using the same, hard-coded method?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Is <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.rsacryptoserviceprovider(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>RSACryptoServiceProvider</code></a>'s behavior a cause for concern, or are these things normal?</p>

<h2>Update 1</h2>

<p>In <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/2335/should-rsa-public-exponent-be-only-in-3-5-17-257-or-65537-due-to-security-c"">Should RSA public exponent be only in {3, 5, 17, 257 or 65537} due to security considerations?</a>, the accepted answer starts off by noting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no known weakness for any short or long public exponent for RSA, as long as the public exponent is ""correct"" (i.e. relatively prime to p-1 for all primes p which divide the modulus).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this is so, then I'd guess that the apparently-constant exponent of <code>0x010001</code>$=65537$ is sufficient as long as it's relatively prime to $p-1$.  So, presumably the .NET implementation of RSA checks for this condition.</p>

<p>But then what does <code>RSACryptoServiceProvider</code> do if that condition isn't satisfied?  If it selects a different exponent, then that'd seem to leak information about $p$ whenever the exponent isn't <code>0x010001</code>.  Or, if a different key is selected, then it'd seem like we can just assume that the exponent is always <code>0x010001</code> and omit it from the serialization.</p>
","<p>Everything reported is normal, and non-alarming.</p>

<p>It is perfectly OK for the public exponent <em>e</em> to be short and non-random. <em>e</em> = 2<sup>16</sup>+1 = 65537 = 0x010001 is common and safe. Some authorities mandate it (or some range including it). Using it (or/and something significantly larger than the bit size of the public modulus) gives some protection against some of the worst RSA paddings.</p>

<p>No, the 17 extra bytes in the public key are unlikely to be an information leak; they more likely are a header part of the data format chosen for an RSA public key by the software you use. My guess is that you are encountering the MS-specific format detailed in this <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/41874/555"">answer</a> (perhaps, within endianness), which also uses precisely 276 bytes for an RSA public key with a 2048-bit public modulus. In that case, you should find that the extra bytes are always the same (thus they demonstrably leak nothing). And there are countless more subtle ways to leak information about the private key, like in the public modulus itself.</p>

<p>Many RSA key generators used in practice, including I guess <code>RSACryptoServiceProvider</code>, first choose <em>e</em>, then somewhat avoid generating primes <em>p</em> such that gcd(<em>e</em>, <em>p</em>-1) &ne; 1. Since <em>e</em> = 65537 is prime, it is enough that ( <em>p</em> % <em>e</em> ) &ne; 1, and this is easily checked, or otherwise insured by the process generating <em>p</em>.</p>

<p>You can also go the other route and have the key generated on the remote system and try importing the private key into your Putty key chain. That might work too and will guarantee its compatible with the remote system.</p>

<p>Edit :Its for mac not iOS.</p>
","<p>There are 2 ways to do it</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use <code>SecKeyCopyAttributes</code> function</p>

<pre><code>CFDictionaryRef attrs = SecKeyCopyAttributes(key);
CFDataRef data = (CFDataRef) CFDictionaryGetValue(attrs, kSecValueData);
CFShow(data);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Use <code>SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation</code> function</p>

<pre><code>CFDataRef data = SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation(key, NULL);
CFShow(data);

I want to test it by comparing it to the output of the Cipher class in Java using RSA-OAEP and SHA-256. According to PKCS #1, RSA-OAEP requires a label, which by default is an empty string. However, I can't find a way to input a label in the built-in class. My implementation seems to work correctly for both encryption and decryption, but Cipher class produces different output. Is there a default label which the Cipher class uses?</p>
","<p>What is called label L in PKCS1v2.1 RSAES-OAEP was called encoding parameters P in v2.0; see the description of pSourceAlgorithm in A.2.1. The Java API keeps the old terminology, presumably for compatibility, and the default is indeed an empty octet string, implemented in Java as a <code>byte</code> array of length 0. See <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/crypto/spec/PSource.PSpecified.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/crypto/spec/PSource.PSpecified.html</a> . Note that even when P-call-me-L is empty, its <em>hash</em> which goes in DB before masking is not empty.</p>

<p>When you say 'different output', you do realize that OAEP is randomized (in a way that provably does not leak information to the adversary) and every encryption of the same plaintext should produce a unique ciphertext, but all of them should decrypt back to the same plaintext, right?</p>

","<p>You haven't given enough information, such as the actual signature or how it is encoded. Normally RSA means RSA in PKCS#1 1.5 mode using SHA-1 (Google it) which is more or less the default signature generation/verification algorithm in use today. In that case, the verify should proceed as you've described. The password is not needed anymore, it might just be used to decrypt the private key. You can still use the private key to see if an sign in PHP/openssl does create the same data. If not, a different hash or PKCS#1 v2.1 signature may have been used.</p>

<p>The signature is <em>not</em> the hash size. The signature is the size of the modulus (or more correctly, <strong><em><code>[0,n-1]</code></em></strong>). After protocol framing, the signature may be larger than the modulus size. Also see <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/q/3505"">What is the length of an RSA signature?</a> on the Cryptography Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>As for creating an equivalent iOS example, using the ""Raw Sign"" or ""Raw Encrypt"", see <a href=""http://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Raw_RSA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Raw RSA</a> on the Crypto++ wiki. Its usually a bad idea for you to do the low level things like a modular exponentiation. You should try to stay in the protocols and cryptosystems, like <code>RSASSA_PKCS1v15_SHA_Signer</code> and <code>RSASSA_PKCS1v15_SHA_Verifier</code>.</p>

<p>Also checkout the <a href=""http://www.cryptopp.com/docs/ref/annotated.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>RSASS</code> class</a>, which is RSA Signature Scheme. I'm guessing you will probably want a <code>RSASS&lt;PKCS1v15, SHA256&gt;::Signer</code> and <code>RSASS&lt;PKCS1v15, SHA256&gt;::Verifier</code>:</p>

<p>Initially, I was generating the incorrect key type. I was able to generate the key by concatenating the X and Y arrays from JWK. Here's my sample code I was playing with in F#. It uses BouncyCastle for the Keccak hash function.
Important thing to note is the use of ""EC-HSM"" key type. This is part of the Premium SKU for Key Vault and only this type supports SECP256K1 curve, otherwise throws an exception if using ""EC"" key type.</p>

This backend server runs on Sails behind an ELB. What I want to do, is to filter some of the routes in Sails, and the policy should look for the Certificate in the request, if it is not sent, then reject and if its (validating against the public Key) then allow it to continue.</p>

<p>In the docs of AWS API Gateway (<a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started-client-side-ssl-authentication.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started-client-side-ssl-authentication.html</a>), they suggest to use client-certificate-auth (<a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/client-certificate-auth"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.npmjs.com/package/client-certificate-auth</a>), but I can't find a way to use it on my Sails backend. </p>

<p>I've tried using serverOptions in Sails, but it crashes with:</p>

<pre><code>error: TypeError: ""listener"" argument must be a function
</code></pre>

<p>So I'm pretty much lost on this one. If anyone has experience with it, please advice :)</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p><strong>Step 0:</strong>
As mentioned in some of the comments - you'll need to change the ELB to be a classic ELB and load balance TCP on port 443 instead of HTTPS. </p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> you'll need to launch sails with HTTPS - the config looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>      http: {
        serverOptions: {
          requestCert: true,
          rejectUnauthorized: true
        }
      },
      ssl: {
        key: key.Body.toString(),
        cert: cert.Body.toString()
      }
</code></pre>

<p>So either <code>config/http.js</code> and <code>config/ssl.js</code>, or pass those to <code>sails.lift()</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> run the middleware. - there are lots of different ways to do this, but since you say you only want to do it some routes, I'd create a policy that runs client-certificate-auth, or even possibly better, just call <code>req.connection.getPeerCertificate()</code> and check the things you want to check. No need to use an extra npm module when you don't have to. </p>

<p>If yes, how to achieve that in phpseclib ( <a href=""http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/</a> ) library? Theirs examples (<a href=""http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/new/rsa/examples.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/new/rsa/examples.html</a>) aren't very clear. However, my understanding of RSA isn't very clear either (that's why I am currently playing with it), so I will need some help.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is what I have been able to do so far</p>

<pre><code>define('CRYPT_RSA_EXPONENT', $e);

<p>The Crypt_RSA class provides functions like ""loadKey($key)"" and ""setPublicKey($key)"". I guess I will be using one of them, but first I need to know public key. So .. do I know the public key? As I said, I have public key exponent and public key modulus, but is it possible to construct public key based on those two values?</p>

<p>I will be very happy for some explanation or working example.</p>
","<p>Normally RSA keys are string that have both the modulo and exponent embedded within them. eg.</p>

<pre><code>-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

</code></pre>

<p>...etc.</p>

<p>If you're working with them as distinct ""objects"" then it makes me wonder if you're trying to do textbook RSA, which shouldn't really be used outside of the classroom.</p>

<p>In any event,</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
include('Crypt/RSA.php');
include('Math/BigInteger.php');

<p>Math_BigInteger itself can optionally take two parameters. The second tells it the format, be it base-10, base-256, base-16, base-2, etc. If you have a base64 encoded number you'll need to pass it through base64_decode and (probably) tell Math_BigInteger that it's a base-256 number. By default Math_BigInteger assumes numbers are base-10.</p>

<p>To do textbook RSA after that (ie. no randomized padding - this method should not be used in real world applications) do the following:</p>

","<p>I don't think I can give a proper response because I'm not sure the goal of your system is clear. While I appreciate you getting feedback on a design, it's a bit hard without a purpose.</p>

<p>I would suggest to you this though:</p>

<p><strong>Strongly document and analyse your threat model first</strong></p>

<p>You need to come up with a fixed hard-lined list of all possible attack scenarios. Local attackers, etc, who are you trying to protect against? You also say things like 'with proper key management'; yet this is one of the hardest things to do. So don't just <em>assume</em> you can get this right; fully plan out how you will do this, with specific linking to who it will prevent attacks by.</p>

<p>The reason you need to do a threat model, is that you will need to determine on what angles you will be vulnerable; because this will be the case.</p>

<p>I will also suggest that while the theory is good; in crypto <em>implementation</em> is also very critical. Do not just assume that you will do things correctly, you really need to take care as to where random numbers come from, and other such things.</p>

<p>I know this is a bit vague, but I do think that at least coming up with formal and strong threat model, will be very helpful for you.</p>

"1452527","How secure is this architecture?","<p>I'm building a system that need to collect some user sensitive data via secured web connection, store it securely on the server for later automated decryption and reuse. System should also allow user to view some part of the secured data (e.g., <code>*****ze</code>) and/or change it completely via web. System should provide reasonable level of security.</p>

<p>I was thinking of the following infrastructure:</p>

<p><strong>App (Web) Server 1</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Web server with proper TLS support
for secured web connections.</p></li>
<li><p>Use public-key algorithm (e.g. RSA) to
encrypt entered user sensitive data
and send it to <em>App Server 2</em> via
one-way outbound secured channel
(e.g. ssh-2) without storing it
anywhere on either <em>App Server 1</em> or <em>DB
Server 1</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use user-password-dependent
symmetric-key algorithm to encrypt
some part of the entered data (e.g.
last few letters/digits) and store
it on the <em>DB Server 1</em> for later
retrieval by <em>App Server 1</em> during
user web session.</p></li>
<li><p>Re-use step 2 for data modification by user via web.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>DB Server 1</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Store unsecured non-sensitive user
data.</li>
<li>Store some part of the sensitive
user data encrypted on <em>App Server 1</em>
(see step 3 above)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>App Server 2</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> <strong>EVER</strong> send anything
<strong>TO</strong> <em>App Server 1</em> or <em>DB Server 1</em>.</li>
<li>Receive encrypted user sensitive
data from <em>App Server 1</em> and store it
in <em>DB Server 2</em>.</li>
<li>Retrieve encrypted
user sensitive data from <em>DB Server 2</em>
according to the local schedules,
decrypt it using private key
(see <em>App Server 1</em>, step 2) stored
locally on <em>App Server 2</em> with proper key management.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>DB Server 2</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Store encrypted user sensitive data (see <em>App Server 2</em>, step 2)</li>
</ol>

<p>If either <em>App (Web) Server 1</em> or <em>DB Server 1</em> or both are compromised then attacker will not be able to get any user sensitive data (either encrypted or not). All attacker will have is access to public-key and encryption algorithms which are well known anyway.

<p>How secure is this architecture? Is my understanding of how encryption algorithms and secured protocols work correct?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
","<p>I would not recommend using any form of public key to communicate from your web server to your app server.  If you control both system just a regular secret system of encryption.  You know the identity of your app server, so keeping the key secure is not an issue.  If you ever need to change or update the secret key just do so manually to prevent it from leaking across a connection.</p>

<p>What I would be most careful about is direction of data transfer from your server in your DMZ, which should only be your webserver, to those boxes residing internally to your network.  It is becoming increasingly common for legitimate domains to be compromised to distribute malware to visiting users.  That is bad, but if the malware were to turn in ward to your network instead of only outward to your users then your business would be completely hosed.</p>

<p>I also did not see anything about preventing sql injection or system hardening/patching to prevent malware distribution.  This should be your first and most important consideration.  If security were important to you then you would be your architecture to be flexible to minor customizations of inter-server communication and frequent patching.  Most websites, even major legitimate businesses, never fix their security holes even if they are compromised.  You must be continually fixing security holes and changing things to prevent holes from arise if you wish to avoid being compromised in the first place.</p>

<p>To prevent becoming a malware distributor I would suggest making hard and fast rules upon how media is served that contains any sort of client-side scripting.  Client-side scripting can be found in JavaScript, ActiveX, Flash, Acrobat, Silverlight, and other code or plugin that executes on the client system.  Policies for serving that content must exist so that anomolous code fragments can be immediately identified.  My recommendation is to <strong>NEVER</strong> embed client-side code directly into a browser, but always reference some external file.  I would also suggest conslidating like minded media to give you better asset control and save you bandwidth, such as serving one large JavaScript file instead of 8 small ones.  I would also recommend forcing all such media onto an external content distribution system that references your domain in its directory structure.  That way media is not served from your servers directly and if it served from you directly you can quickly identify it as potentially malicious and necessittating a security review.</p>

<p>While chatting 2 users say A and B. After both users logged in and have some communication between them. Now both users reload/logged out or logged in then old messages was sent was not able to decrypt as new private keys will be generated.
I so not want to stored the public and private key of users in database or in local storage.</p>
","<p>David from Virgil here. Thanks for the question and sorry for making you puzzled.</p>

<p>I believe the issue is: while the sample app generated user private &amp; public keys both for Alice and Bob, published the public keys to our Cards service, it hasn’t saved the private keys anywhere. So, the private keys remained in the browser's local storage and as such, didn’t sync to other browsers/devices where your users have logged in next. So in lack of their private keys, your users weren’t able to decrypt their messages... This is a limitation of the sample app and we should fix that ASAP (task created).</p>

<p>In order to get the app working, I.e. make your users be able to log in from another browser and decrypt messages, they need to retrieve their respected private keys from a central location. Now, it'd be too lame for me to recommend to just save the user private keys to your database (and enable others to access it + decrypt your users' messages), so we created a technology called BrainKey to encrypt the user private key with a key that we derive from the user’s password. Similar approach how Apple uses your TouchID-derived key to encrypt your keychain.</p>

<p>This is what you need to do to make it work:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>During user signup (on the client device), generate a private key for your user and publish the public key to our Cards service.</p></li>
<li><p>Then use the user's password to generate a BrainKey (which technically is a private key).</p></li>
<li><p>Generate the public key from the BrainKey and encrypt the user's previously (Step 1) generated private key.</p></li>

"51606458","How to encrypt and decrypt messages using Virgil security?","<p>I am trying to integrate Virgil security in my basic chat application but it won't as needed.</p>

<p>While chatting 2 users say A and B. After both users logged in and have some communication between them. Now both users reload/logged out or logged in then old messages was sent was not able to decrypt as new private keys will be generated.
I so not want to stored the public and private key of users in database or in local storage.</p>
","<p>I'm Dim from Virgil. Let me help you with this use-case.</p>

<p>I prepared some additional information:</p>

<p>Steps #1 and #2 from Virgil Simple JS Demo (You’ve already seen it)</p>

<p><strong>Step #1. User Registration Step.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YaVEA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">users register their Public Keys</a></p>

<p>At this step:</p>

<ul>
<li>You authenticate Alice</li>
<li>After you successfully authenticated Alice, you give her a JWT to grant her access to Virgil’s Cloud APIs</li>
<li>Alice generates her Private Key (2) -> stores her Private Key into Local Storage -> creates her Virgil Card</li>
<li>Alice Publishes (3) her Virgil Card on Virgil Cards Service (She uses her JWT to do it).</li>
<li>Then you authenticate Bob (User B): same story as Alice.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end, Alice and Bob have their own Private Keys and Virgil Cards (Public Key published into our cloud for users to find each other’s Public Keys). </p>

<p><strong>Step #2. Simple Communication (chat).</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8JzCe.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Simple e2e encrypted communication</a></p>

<p>At this step:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alice looks for &amp; finds Bob’s Public Key at Virgil Cards Service (1)</li>
<li>Alice loads her Private Key from her Local Storage in a browser</li>
<li>Alice signs (with her Private Key) and encrypts (with Bob’s Public Key) a message and sends to Bob through your Application Server</li>
<li>Bob receives the encrypted and signed message</li>
<li>Bob goes to Cards Service to find Alice’s Public Key in order to verify her signature</li>
<li>Bob loads his Private Key from his Local Storage and decrypts the message</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>As a result</strong>, Bob verified Alice’s signature and decrypted the Message from Alice.</p>

<p>And now, <strong>comes the problem</strong>: Alice decided to use another Browser (or a Device B), but she can’t encrypt Bob’s previous messages on the new device.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> you should transmit her Previous Private Key from Device A to Device B. To do this in the most secure way:</p>

<ul>
<li>is to encrypt Private Key on a device A with some Additional Secret Key.</li>
<li>transmit encrypted Private Key to Device B. </li>
<li>use the same Additional Secret Key on Device B to decrypt the encrypted Private Key from Device A.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, as you see you must use some special Additional Secret Key on both devices (some messengers do this with a QR code between the devices) to do it securely. To do it simpler though, we have a special tech for you to you generate the “Additional Secret Key” that will be the same on both devices. We call that Secret Key - a Brain Key. <strong>Brain Key</strong> - a strong cryptographic asymmetric key based on Alice’s PASSWORD. </p>

<p>You can find more information about this key here: <a href=""https://developer.virgilsecurity.com/docs/java/use-cases/v1/brainkey"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developer.virgilsecurity.com/docs/java/use-cases/v1/brainkey</a></p>

<p>So now, let’s take a look at the next step.</p>

<p><strong>Step #3. Store your Private Key in the Cloud</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EdKNy.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">store somewhere encrypted Private Key</a></p>

<p>At this step:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alice enters her Password</li>
<li>Alice generates a Brain Key from her password (1)</li>
<li>Alice encrypts her Private Key with the Brain Key (2)</li>
<li>Alice uploads her encrypted private key somewhere in Cloud (to your app’s backend/database)  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>As a result</strong>, Alice will have her encrypted Private Key in the cloud, that she used to chat with Bob.</p>

<p><strong>Step #4. Alice now uses her new Browser (or new Device)</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2pI6w.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">transmit a Private Key</a></p>

<p>At this step:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alice enters her Password (the same that she used previously for Brain Key generation).</li>
<li>This generates her Brain Key (1)</li>
<li>Alice downloads her encrypted Private Key from the Cloud / from your backend/database (2)</li>
<li>Alice decrypts the encrypted Private Key with the Brain Key</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>As a result</strong>, Alice will get her Private Key on a Device B, that she used to chat with Bob on a Device A. This way, the chat conversation survived her device change.</p>

<p>Every time when Alice uses a new device, she can re-generate the same Brain Key and easily get her Private Key, the key that she uses on all her devices to chat with Bob.</p>

<p>The implementations listed on the Wikipedia page for NTRUEncrypt don't have it included, and there's a paper covering the algorithm <a href=""https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/718.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""here"">here</a> but the language is a bit too technical for me to be able to understand it fully.</p>
","<h3>Future readers, please prove me wrong (and post your own answer).</h3>

<p>Given it is pretty new (<a href=""https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/718"" rel=""nofollow"">November 2013</a>) there probably aren't any implementations at all. Even the authors of the paper might not have implemented it themselves (you could ask them though). But as far as I can tell the protocol only uses operations that would have to be included in NTRUEncrypt implementations anyway. So it shouldn't be to difficult to write one yourself on top of an existing NTRU library. You can ask specific questions on the protocol here or on <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com"">https://crypto.stackexchange.com</a>. Probably you should try to understand the basics of NTRUEncrypt first, though.</p>

"46647976","Creating Encrypted connection for Amazon Aurora DB with public key","<p>I am using Maria JDBC driver for creating a connection to Amazon Aurora DB
I wanted to create a secured connection so I read <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Aurora.Connect.html#Aurora.Connect.SSL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To connect to a DB cluster with SSL using the MySQL utility</p>
  
  <p>Download the public key for the Amazon RDS signing certificate from
  <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem</a>.
  Note that this will download a file named rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>First Question:</strong> How exactly is it secured - anyone can download this <code>pem</code> file from <code>Amazon AWS</code>?</p>

<p>I did some research How should i connect into Aurora DB with public key
and i found these 2 links  <a href=""https://coderanch.com/t/455178/databases/SOLVED-Connection-mysql-certificates"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">First</a>, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33700647/jdbc-parameter-verifyservercertificate-false-connects-without-the-need-for-a-cli"">Second</a></p>

<p><strong>So my Code is quite Simple:</strong></p>

<pre><code>Class.forName(""org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver"");

Properties prop = new Properties();

prop.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStore"",""C:\\temp\\rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem"");
prop.setProperty(""user"",jdbcDetails.username);
prop.setProperty(""password"",jdbcDetails.getSensitiveData());

    java.sql.Connection conne = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcDetails.connectionString, prop);
    try (Statement stmt1 = conne.createStatement()) {
        // Execute all but the rest
        ResultSet rs = stmt1.executeQuery(""Select 98765 from dual limit 2"");
        while(rs.next()) {

            rs.getLong(1);
        }
    }
    conne.close();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Second Question:</strong> How is having the <code>public key file</code> relate to Encryption?</p>

<p>The above information doesn't get along with <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javadb/10.6.2.1/adminguide/cadminsslclient.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Oracle Java information</a> that says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the client wants to authenticate the server, then the client's trust store must contain the server's certificate</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Third Question:</strong> From what I understand if the client trust the server it doesn't require him to use this file</p>

<p><strong>Forth Question:</strong> I was checking the connection creation with Wireshark
both cases with and without this <code>public key file</code> i was able to create a connection and both cases in Wireshark appeared Encrypted</p>

<p>Something that looks like that:</p>

<pre><code>Encrypted Application Data:
eb:62:45:fb:10:50:f7:8c............:b9:0a:52:e7:97:1d:34
</code></pre>
","<p>Base on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33700647/jdbc-parameter-verifyservercertificate-false-connects-without-the-need-for-a-cli"">this answer</a> I understand about public key usage:</p>

<p>First,
It appears that Amazon AWS Azure documentation is misleading a bit - it is only relevant for connection with specific tool called <strong>MySQL utility</strong></p>

<p><strong>An answer for First &amp; Second &amp; third Question:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Java can definitely establish an SSL connection without a client
  validating the certificate chain of the server.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the key exchange is made to ensure that the server that it's connected to is indeed the one it was expecting (i.e non-suspicious server)
This means that it's still the same SSL connection made, but with verifyServerCertificate=false it does not verify that it is the intended server</p>

<p><strong>Answer Forth Question:</strong>
Currect, The code is in Java - and passing the SSL parameter make it encrypted.</p>

<p>So using these parameter gives what requires 
<code>?trustServerCertificate=true&amp;useSSL=true&amp;requireSSL=true&amp;verifyServerCertificate=false</code></p>

<p>Here is my inverse function but I took this from somewhere so I am almost positive it is correct.  Plus I have tested it and is working.</p>

    BigInteger s;

    BigInteger s1;
    BigInteger t1;
    BigInteger gcd = eea(b%a, a, &amp;s1, &amp;t1);
    *s = t1 - (b/a) * s1;
    *t = s1;

    return gcd;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Other than that there is only my function to reduce the amount of operations to point doublings and additions.  I have worked out many examples by hand so I know the data coming out of this function is correct.  </p>

<p>The weird thing is that I have tried this on an example in my cryptography class with values m=17 x=5 y=1 a=2 and I am getting all the values I should be getting.  I didn't code a way for the values to 'wrap around' once the inverse of the base point is reached but since with bitcoin the private key space is much much smaller than the modulo value so we shouldn't even reach that point when values start repeating themselves. I am about to cry with how frustrating this is so any help would be wonderful.  </p>

<p>Oh also there is one other weird thing.  Here is an example when I run it.</p>

<p>It's not obvious but the last 19 hex digits are the same but the rest is different? They are the same length by the way.  Could this be something wrong with the BigInteger Library?  This was a way that seemed simple to me but would you recommend I did it a different way?</p>

","<p>You normally provide the git server with <em>your</em> public key (e.g. as it is done in github - you first have to send them your public key) first. This is then used by the server for authentication. Once you connect to the git server, you sign a message with your private key. This message is validated by the server with your previously provided public key (<a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4252#section-7"" rel=""nofollow"">cf. RFC 4252 section 7</a>). If the server is able to validate the message with your public key it can be sure that you are indeed the person you claim to be.</p>

<p>On the server side, the public key is also used for authentication purposes. The server typically sends its public key to you once you connect via SSH (for RSA cf. e.g.<a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4432"" rel=""nofollow"">RFC4432</a>) - this is when you are asked to accept a certain public key fingerprint. If you do accept, during this connection and subsequent connections, the server will use its private key to sign a message for generating a session key (more on that in asecond) that is being sent to you. You try to authenticate this message by using the server's public key to be sure you are talking to the right server. The message is then used to derive a symmetric encryption key to be used throughout the rest of the session. </p>

<p>The purpose for using symmetric keys to do the actual encryption is simply for reasons of performance, symmetric cryptography is much faster. This implies that the asymmetric public/private keys are merely used for authentication purposes.</p>

","<p>To be clear: I have a hunch that your clients are probably not willing to sacrifice <em>all of the conveniences</em> that come with having your system manage some of the cryptography; you should probably present several options and their weaknesses vs convenience.</p>

<h3>General Points</h3>

<p>Before anything else, you start start with an explicit <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model"" rel=""nofollow"">threat model</a>, covering every possible attack you can think of.  Even if you choose not to address some of the attacks (it's unrealistic to handle everything), you'll ferret out the more obvious attacks, and have at least a basic set of steps for handling others should they occur.</p>

<h3>Re: Does this make any sense?</h3>

<p>I think the general premise, while overkill on the part of your customers, makes sense from a security perspective.  Your clients want a cryptographically secure system; fair enough.</p>

<p>However, some points on your proposed solution:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>By allowing the client to pass their password over the wire, an attacker (which your client seems to think could be you) needs to only man in the middle that password to gain access to the pricing data.</p>

<ul>
<li>SSL helps mitigate this, but an errant log line somewhere along the line could very well expose the client's password by accident.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>only</em> truly cryptographically secure way (as I see it) for the client to <em>ensure</em> that you don't have access to the pricing data is for them to encrypt it, and your system just acts as a broker for the encrypted data.  This, in effect, makes you a broker of encrypted packets and public keys, but your system <strong>should never see</strong> private keys.</p>

<p>The question is: are clients willing to manage their own keys, or is that too burdensome to them?  You might be able to automate most of it, at least (client app/website would handle storing the private key locally, and would also be responsible for gathering public keys of the other interested parties in order to decrypt their encrypted bids)</p>

<h3>Re: Would we generate the keys using OpenSSL, OpenPGP, or another solution?</h3>

<p>Really doesn't matter all that much; each of those options just define the container format for the public/private keys and any metadata.  Use whichever one fits your language/platform best.</p>

<p>The main decision point should be in which encryption algorithm and key strength: RSA-2048?  RSA-4096?  elliptic curve?  something else?</p>

<p>Specific to Ruby: You're probably just going to want to use the <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">OpenSSL</a> library, since it's part of the standard library.  But to reiterate my point above: It's even better if your servers never even see the private keys (if the clients are ok with the trade off of better security over convenience)</p>

<h3>Re: What happens if a user wants to change his password or generate a new key?</h3>

<p>Changing a password is trivial: the private key its self is just encrypted w/ some symmetric algorithm.  Changing the password involves decrypting the existing key, and re-encrypting it with the new key.  If the client were to lose their password, there is no recovery.</p>

<p>Generating a new key is probably safer, but requires more diligence on your part (encrypted payloads will need to identify which key they match, and clients could have multiple keys active at a time).  This is a good thing, though; it is a common practice to rotate keys regularly, even if they are not compromised.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I am a bit sceptical about this step. If you (the developer company) generate both the public and the private key used for the encryption it means you are 50% into being able to break the encryption. The only thing that protects your customer is the password, which you might be able to bruteforce (i am not suggesting that you will but you have the ability to do so)</p>

<p>If you will use PKI (or what you have described) you need to ensure that the key creation does not happen on your system. The client should create the pair on their systems and then provide you with their publoic key which you will use to encrypt the prices. The client then will be able to decrypt using the private key on which they have sole control</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What would some of the pitfalls be with this solution?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The pitfall is that you are making a complex solution. Especially if you follow my advice above, then you place your trust on the customer to not ""lose"" the private key (and/or password) or else they won't be able to decrypt the prices. In addition, if the key leaks from their side, it's difficult to prove that your application is ""innocent""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would we generate the keys using OpenSSL, OpenPGP or another solution?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to prevent the pitfall of a customer losing a key, you might want to look into PGP (the commercial version does this for sure) and into the concept of ADK (additional decryption key) and ""split keys"". The idea is that besides encrypting with the public key of the customer you also encrypt with a ""corporate"" key which can only be used if y out of x number of people come together (as an example, 10 people can possess parts of the key and if 6 of them come together they can reconstruct the key). The parts can be shared amongst your company, the client, their lawyer, etc</p>

</ul>
","<p>So here's my suggestion, if you want to solve this using encryption...</p>

<ul>
<li>Each user <em>and</em> each company should generate <a href=""http://openpgp.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">OpenPGP</a> (or <a href=""http://gnupg.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">GnuPG</a>) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography"" rel=""noreferrer"">asymmetric</a> public/private key pairs</li>
<li>Each of those public keys should be uploaded to a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_server_%28cryptographic%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">public key server</a></li>
<li>Companies could optionally ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature"" rel=""noreferrer"">sign</a>"" the public keys of the individual users, to designate a trust relationship with those users (and revoke that signature if that relationship changes)</li>
<li>The auctioneer or non-partisan arbiter would also generate a key pair and push that public key to the public key server</li>
<li>As part of an auction registration process, each user would import the public key of the auctioneer, and the auctioneer would import the public key of each user</li>
<li>A trusted third party, perhaps a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service"" rel=""noreferrer"">SaaS</a> vendor outside of the auctioneer, would host a service through which users and the auctioneer would communicate</li>
<li>Bidding users would create a bid by

<ul>
<li>signing their bid with their private key</li>
<li>encrypting their proposed price to <em>two</em> keys: their own public key <em>and</em> the auctioneer's public key</li>
<li>submitting their bid to the trusted third party service, which would need to enforce an embargo on any user retrieving bids before the auction expiration</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At auction end, and <em>only</em> after auction end, the auctioneer retrieves all of the bids, decrypts them, and verifies signatures</li>
</ul>

<p>A couple of key points:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's essential that no user or company private keys are ever shared or stored within the service -- that's the only real ""flaw"" I see in your proposed methodology in your question.  If that's the case, it would be very possible for one user to accuse an administrator of ""fraud"" or ""tampering"" with bids, as an administrator of your server would ultimately have access to the private keys of all users, since you've generated them yourself.</li>
<li>Along those same lines, it's essential that any an all communication and ""bids"" are cryptographically ""signed"" with the <em>truly</em> private keys by each user.  This is how you would know that a bid came from one particular user and <em>only</em> that user, and that the bid could not have been tampered with.</li>
<li>Encrypting the bids to the public keys of the bidding user and the auctioneer ensures that the third party SaaS vendor has no introspection into the bids themselves during the blackout period while the auction is open.  I believe this is the most important point to solving your problem as described.</li>
<li>Note that it might actually be preferred to encrypt each bid to a ring of <em>all</em> of the bidding users, if by design you want to make all bids public after the auction is closed.  That would be a slight modification to my algorithm as described above.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the interest of full disclosure and perhaps some subtle marketing, I happen to be the architect and CTO of a company called <a href=""http://gazzang.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">Gazzang</a> who has implemented a product called <a href=""http://gazzang.com/products/ztrustee"" rel=""noreferrer"">zTrustee</a> which operates exactly as described above ;-)</p>

","<p>The home directory for the git User in an Omnibus install is by default <code>/var/opt/gitlab</code>. You can either check your <code>gitlab.rb</code> config file for the key <code>user['home']</code> and see if you have modified it or do a <code>cat /etc/passwd</code>and find the home diretory for the user git there.</p>

<p>How to generate signing key with such a fancy public key?</p>
","<p>That's the ECMA Standard defined public key.</p>

<p>It's to deal with three conflicting requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>A mechanism that ensures that assemblies are signed by their creators and could not have been created by a fraudulent other party.</li>
<li>That CLI be defined openly in such a way that other people are free to implement a version (Mono would be a real-life example).</li>
<li>That there be a standard library of classes made available with every version of the framework.</li>
</ol>

<p>These three things can't happen at the same time!</p>

<p>If I create a version of .NET (point 2), then I need to provide a version of the standard library (point 3), which needs to be trusted (point 1), so I need to sign it to prove that I'm Microsoft. Oh wait, I'm not Microsoft! (eh, point 2 again).</p>

<p>Instead what happens is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I create a public-private key pair. People trusted to build new release versions of the assemblies in my framework library implementation have access to the private key, the public key can be known to anyone doing any work on the CLI implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>I mark the relevant assemblies as having been signed with the key corresponding to the public key <code>00000000000000000400000000000000</code> (defined in the ECMA standard), though really they were signed with the private key mentioned above.</p></li>
<li><p>In the code in the CLI any check on an assembly that claims to have been signed with the key corresponding to the public key <code>00000000000000000400000000000000</code> is checked with the real public key. If this checks out, then it can only have been signed by someone we trust in building those assemblies.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, MS's framework won't trust our assemblies, Mono's won't trust them, and we won't trust either of theirs, because we all have different real keys corresponding to the ECMA standard key. Which is as it should be.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the fact that <code>00000000000000000400000000000000</code> doesn't match any real valid public key means it's not possible for it to clash with any other public key.</p>

","<p>This is NOT the proper answer to the question. The only thing this answer provides is the pointer to ECMA standard, apparently ECMA-335 with CLI specs. But this ECMA standard provides only a basic definition in terms of unique/fixed value and the name it should be called. Otherwise, it provides nothing about how and where the actual public key is found. The value 00000000000000000400000000000000 is NOT a public key, it is only a marker called Standard Public Key which has nothing to do with a real public key. This value is used to compute Public Key Token for the assembly that uses it but this value is not used to as any public key of RSA algorithm when processing the assembly signature. You need a real Public Key. The proper answer to the question should be how and where the actual Public Key is found for the assembly that uses it</p>

After some looking around I discovered <a href=""https://cs.fit.edu/code/projects/cse2410_spring2015_null_pointer/repository/revisions/f7f05cfc8b67c0f4dd2fa80cac161ca38994c51f/entry/core/java/src/freenet/support/CPUInformation/CPUID.java"" rel=""nofollow"">JCPUID</a> by Iakin that is free to use and should work at most operating systems with native libs that I found <a href=""https://cs.fit.edu/code/projects/cse2410_spring2015_null_pointer/repository/revisions/e3abc25c6bf2db93edd6f9a4ed132db7259c5463/show/installer/lib/jbigi"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>My idea is to do two modules: main application that will show popup window with CPU ID and verification text field and key generator app. User will pass CPU ID to keygen owner, who will return verification code (generated with keygen) to user. After user submits correct verification code, license file with that code will be created at filesystem. Every time the application starts up, it will check the existence and correctness of that file and load main application screen after that.</p>

<p>What about code verification, I think the best option will be to use asymmetric cryptography, in particular RSA. The public key will be built-in into application and secret will be built-in into key generator. So CPUID will be passed to key generator owner and then signed with RSA. That signature will be transferred back to user, who will verify its validity with built-in public key.</p>

<p>I generated gpg key pairs using Kleopatra and gpg Linux command line tool itself. Then I tried to sign something using this method:</p>

<pre><code>    private byte[] createSignature(byte[] file) {
    byte[] signature = null;

    try {
        java.security.KeyStore keyStoreFile = java.security.KeyStore

        keyStoreFile.load(getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(""/secret.asc""),
        ""******"".toCharArray());

        PrivateKey privateKey = (PrivateKey) keyStoreFile.getKey(
                ""My Name Here"", ""******"".toCharArray());

        Signature dsa = Signature.getInstance(""SHA1withRSA"");
        dsa.initSign(privateKey);
        dsa.update(file, 0, file.length);
        signature = dsa.sign();

    } catch (Exception e) {
        // TODO Auto-generated catch block
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return signature;
}

","<p>The Java crypto framework does not support OpenPGP. X.509 keys, for example in the PKCS12 format, are incompatible with OpenPGP -- although they rely on (mostly) the same cryptographic algorithms.</p>

<p>Either use X.509 certificates (you could also create your own CA for this purpose), or rely on an implementation of OpenPGP for Java. In terms of open source libraries, you can choose between the native Java implementation <a href=""https://www.bouncycastle.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">BouncyCastle</a> (MIT license), or interface <a href=""http://www.gnupg.org"" rel=""nofollow"">GnuPG</a> (GPL) through the <a href=""http://wiki.gnupg.org/APIs"" rel=""nofollow"">Java GPGME binding</a> (LGPL).</p>

<p>BouncyCastle is probably the better way to go, as all you need to do is add another Java library, not install another software into the system.</p>

<p>You can't.</p>

<p>Private keys cannot be generated from public keys. This is absolutely fundamental to public key cryptography.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I get the following errors..</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>NameError: name 'addr' is not defined</code></p>

<p>You must define or initialize <code>addr</code> <em>before</em> using it.</p>

  <p><code>TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable</code></p>

<p>See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/3887381/477035"">TypeError: &#39;NoneType&#39; object is not iterable in Python</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>IndentationError: unexpected indent</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Python depends on <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/indentation.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">indentation</a> as part of its syntax, for example indentation is used to define blocks where other languages might use <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> or <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code>.</p>

<p>If you have too much or too little indentation it alters the meaning of the code and may not make any sense. You must pay careful attention to indentation when using Python.</p>

<p>In particular, I suspect that if you set tab-spacing to other than 8 and irregularly mix tabs with spaces in indentation, you will have problems.</p>

","<p>From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA#Attacks_against_plain_RSA"" rel=""nofollow"">wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RSA has the property that the product
  of two ciphertexts is equal to the
  encryption of the product of the
  respective plaintexts. That is m1^e m2^e≡(m1m2)^e (mod n) Because
  of this multiplicative property a
  chosen-ciphertext attack is possible.
  E.g. an attacker, who wants to know
  the decryption of a ciphertext c = m^e
  (mod n) may ask the holder of the
  private key to decrypt an
  unsuspicious-looking ciphertext c' =
  cr^e (mod n) for some value r chosen by
  the attacker. Because of the
  multiplicative property c' is the
  encryption of mr (mod n). Hence, if
  the attacker is successful with the
  attack, he will learn mr (mod n) from
  which he can derive the message m by
  multiplying mr with the modular
  inverse of r modulo n.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's actually pretty neat, thanks for asking the question that lead me to learning this.<br>
As for your question of 3020 vs 600, it's multiplicative; rarely are concatenations used in mathematics, since after all we should always be working independent of base.</p>

<p>Yes, it always possible and you can't rule it out, however is it likely to be the case, I would doubt it. (Of course it depends what are doing with your server).</p>

<p>Most of the time it will be some service or some configuration which has been change but not applied until later i.e. server restart or other automatic process restart.</p>

<p>The only option to investigate this further in my opinion would be (Assuming that you don't want to shut down the server):</p>

<ol>
<li>Take snapshot of the root volume of your affected instance.</li>
<li>Create a volume out of the snapshot.</li>

<p>I have setup the community version (V4). I have 2 web servers with replicated content, I have a virtual IP setup in the system which points to the 2 IP addresses of the web servers. The load balancer works for HTTP and HTTPS traffic correctly but shows an cert error when trying to get to the servers via HTTPS.</p>

<p>I want to combat this by adding a certificate to the load balancer. To do this I have followed the these steps:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.zevenet.com/knowledge-base/howtos/manage-certificates-with-zen-load-balancer/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.zevenet.com/knowledge-base/howtos/manage-certificates-with-zen-load-balancer/</a> (ignoring the bit about purchasing a cert from SofIntel as we use JISC for our Certs)</p>

<p>Basically I created a certificate in the load balancer, generated the CSR, purchased a certificate from JISC by uploading the CSR generated from the load balancer. </p>

<p>I then downloaded the ZIP file from JISC which contains the crt for the domain, as well as the root certificates required also in the ZIP.</p>

<p>I tried uploading the ZIP to the load balancer and it pops up an error showing that the certificate needs to be created in a PEM format.</p>

<p>I then found this here:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.zevenet.com/knowledge-base/howtos/create-certificates-pem-format/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.zevenet.com/knowledge-base/howtos/create-certificates-pem-format/</a></p>

<p>I am not really sure what this is asking me to do....does this mean the original CSR that I generated is irrelevant now? The instructions on the above link say that the PEM file needs to be the following:</p>

<pre><code>-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- Private Key (without passphrase) -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----- 
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- Certificate (CN=www.mydomain.com) -----END CERTIFICATE----- 
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- Intermediate (Intermediate CA, if exists) -----END CERTIFICATE----- 
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- Root (ROOT CA, who signs the Certificate) -----END CERTIFICATE-----
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially I already have the domain certificate, the intermediate and the root all from JISC now. But is there any way  can go about getting the Private key from the load balancer so that I can just create the PEM file manually.</p>

<p>I am pretty new to cert stuff, not sure why it wont just let me upload the zip file.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>
","<p>You haven't set up your SSH keys between EC2 and Github correctly based on the error message, but given the information you've provided, it's not possible to provide suggestions.  </p>

<p>Question - have you set up a deploy key on the EC2 server?  I'm assuming that you are trying to deploy from the EC2 server and not your local machine using SSH Agent Forwarding.  Can you do a git pull from the EC2 server to the github account?  Can you ssh to git@github.com (e.g. ""ssh -T git@github.com"")?  </p>

<p>The links below can help you setup a deploy key or figure out another way to manage deployment.  </p>

<p>Is there a way to create <strong>RSACryptoServiceProvider</strong> from public key only?</p>

<p>I have also tried to use X509Certificate2</p>

<pre><code>X509Certificate2 cert = new X509Certificate2(bytes);  //I got exception here
RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = (RSACryptoServiceProvider)cert2.PublicKey.Key;
</code></pre>

<p>But I get exception <strong>Cannot find the requested object.</strong></p>

<p>Any idea?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>I'll accepted Shaamaan answer because he is ""<strong><em>half</em></strong>"" right. You can actually use SN to sign certificate. <code>ImportCspBlob()</code> will work! However, when you tried to to import public key that generated using <code>sn -p Warehouse.snk WarehousePublic.snk</code>, it won't work.</p>

<p>In order to make it work, you need to generate public key in XML using <code>RSACryptoServiceProvider.ToXmlString(false)</code> and embed it as ""embedded resources"".</p>

<p>What I did is I create a console application. Just cut and paste my code below to generate public key in XML file.</p>

<pre><code>class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        if (args.Length &lt; 2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""Invalid Argument"");
            Console.WriteLine(""Usage:"");
            Console.WriteLine(""\tExtractPublicKey [Input SNK File] [Output XML File]"");
            return;
        }

        using (FileStream fs = File.Open(args[0], FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read))
        {
            byte[] bytes = new byte[fs.Length];
            fs.Read(bytes, 0, bytes.Length);

            using (RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider())
            {
                rsa.ImportCspBlob(bytes);
                using (StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(File.Open(args[1], FileMode.Create, FileAccess.ReadWrite, FileShare.ReadWrite)))
                    sw.Write(rsa.ToXmlString(false));
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>After you compile it, to use the executable simply call:
<code>ExtractPublicKey.exe [SNK File with Private Key] [Output Public Key in XML File]</code></p>

<p>To use the embedded certificate, simply do:</p>

<pre><code>RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();
rsa.FromXmlString(stream.ReadToEnd());
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this help someone that come across the similar problem.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<h2>UPDATED</h2>

<p>Shaamaan answer should be followed. Please READ Shaamaan comment with MSDN link. He answer stands because he is not ONLY provide a correct way for security, but also inform me why SN is not right security tool. Thank you Shaamaan!</p>

","<p>You can store the keys in Microsoft CNG formerly CSP and the SNK can be easily pointing to the Key container .. that way you can even have the keys store in an HSM, this however create a problem with sharing keys on different machine .. if the keys are on a pkcs12 file you can easily make a batch file to store it in the KeyContainer and then use it </p>

<p>I mention it in case you want to solve for the <code>y</code> coordinate yourself, populate the <code>point</code>, and then call <code>SetPublicElement</code> directly.</p>

<hr>

<p>You can also prepend <code>03</code> instead of <code>02</code>. The difference is, the decoding returns either <code>y</code> or <code>p-y</code>. The variability is introduced due to the modular square root shown above. We need to see the generation algorithm to determine what the value should be.</p>

<p>The way PGP, S/MIME and other similar messaging solutions enable a multi-party message is to:
1. Generate a Message Encryption Key (MEK), for example, an AES key for use with mode GCM,
2. Look up the public key of each recipient,
3. Encrypt the MEK to each recipient's public key,
4. Package the encrypted MEKs with the encrypted message,
5. Distribute to participants.</p>

<p>The challenge here is the secure discovery of public keys, most applications punt on this and make the user do manual thumbprint verification or rely on a third-party such as a Certificate Authority to verify the binding of a key to a subject.</p>

<p>You can find an example that does this using webcrypto with a single recipient here:

","<p>An SSL Certificate <strong>is</strong> a public key verified and signed by a <em>Certificate Authority</em>. You generate a public/private key pair, then from that generate a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Certificate Signing Request</a> (which <strong>includes</strong> the public key), which you send to the <em>CA</em>.

<p>It sounds like you already have this though, so you'd need to clarify what you're trying to achieve. It sounds like it may be a client authentication / mutual authentication scenario? If so, it depends on what the service provider requires - certificates for client authentication may need to be signed either by a public authority that the server trusts, or by the server itself.</p>

"29695955","Public key authentication in Safari","<p>I've implemented public key authentication on my website to allow users to sign in without using a password. They can request a certificate once they're signed in (the normal way). In the backend, a new certificate is generated using a self-signed server certificate. In the Apache config, the client side certificate is set to optional, in order to allow users to sign in without a certificate as well.</p>

<p>This all works splendidly, but there's a problem when visiting the website from Safari. When the website is visited for the first time, the browser offers to use a Apple-generated certificate, and the default Safari option is to do so. My server is of course unable to verify this certificate, because it was signed by Apple and not my server. The result is that users get a certificate error and can't visit the website. If a user denies to use the Apple provided certificate, everything works as expected and the user is able to log in normally.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tQ1G3.jpg"" alt=""Safari prompting to use Apple-signed certificate""></p>

<p>The problem is, if the user clicks continue on the first visit (using the Apple-signed certificate), this is remembered in the keychain. This makes the website unaccessible unless one removes the entry in the keychain, which is a pain.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>But how can I do this with a <code>BCECPublicKey</code>?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong><br>
I found out that the <code>BCECPublicKey</code> isn't similar to <code>RSAPublicKey</code> at all. I never knew that the SSH server public key is ECDSA and the client public key is RSA.  </p>

<p>Also the way the bytes are structured is way different. The RSA public key starts with a header(<code>ssh-rsa</code>). The header length can be read from the first 4 bytes(<code>readInt()</code>). But when I do this with the ECDSA the length is way to long to represent a header...</p>

<p><strong>Addition to answer</strong><br>
Something to copy paste:</p>

<pre><code>    BCECPublicKey publicKey = ...;

    byte[] point = SubjectPublicKeyInfo.getInstance(ASN1Sequence.getInstance(publicKey.getEncoded())).getPublicKeyData().getOctets();

    ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    DataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(byteArrayOutputStream);

    dataOutputStream.writeInt(""ecdsa-sha2-nistp256"".getBytes().length);
    dataOutputStream.write(""ecdsa-sha2-nistp256"".getBytes());
    dataOutputStream.writeInt(""nistp256"".getBytes().length);
    dataOutputStream.write(""nistp256"".getBytes());
    dataOutputStream.writeInt(point.length);
    dataOutputStream.write(point);

    MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA256"");
    byte[] result = digest.digest(byteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray());

    String fingerprint = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(result);
</code></pre>
","<p>The OpenSSH publickey format (and the SSH wire format on which it is based) <em>does</em> start with the type, but for ECDSA the type includes the curve id. As an example, one of my test systems has an ecdsa/p256 key as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk '{print $2}' &lt;id_ecdsa.pub |openssl base64 -d -A |xxd

</code></pre>

<p>That consists of:<br>
4 bytes 00000013 bigendian int = 19: length of type<br>
19 bytes 'ecdsa-sha2-nistp256' type<br>
4 bytes 00000008 bigendian int = 8: length of curveid<br>
8 bytes 'nistp256' curveid (redundant, but that's the wire format)<br>
4 bytes 00000041 bigendian int = 65: length of pub point<br>
65 bytes beginning 04: pub point in X9.62 format, copied more conveniently in SEC1, which is 1 byte 04=uncompressed, N bytes X-coordinate, N bytes Y-coordinate where N is the (fixed) size needed to represent the curve's underlying field as unsigned.</p>

<p>These are mostly defined in <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656#section-3.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rfc5656 section 3.1</a> and the curveid's in 6.1. The RFC allows compressed point format, but OpenSSH doesn't use that option.</p>

<p><code>BCECPublicKey.getEncoded()</code> (like all Java PublicKey classes) returns a so-called X.509 (really SubjectPublicKeyInfo, SPKI) encoding which for EC <em>includes</em> the public point in X9.62 uncompressed format, but you need some parsing to extract it. Since you have BC, it's easiest to use that:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] point = SubjectPublicKeyInfo.getInstance(ASN1Sequence.getInstance(encoded)).getPublicKeyData().getOctets();
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively <code>.getW()</code> and <code>.getQ()</code> get the point as a JCE or BC class, from either of which you can get the (affine) X and Y coordinates as <code>BigInteger</code> resp. <code>ECFieldElement</code> which in turn yields <code>BigInteger</code>, and each <code>BigInteger</code> can be converted to a <em>variable-sized</em> byte array which you must then left-pad or left-truncate to the correct size. </p>

<p>The result is the data to be hashed. In case you aren't aware, only OpenSSH versions 6.8 up use base64(sha256(pubkey)) for the fingerprint (by default). Before that it was hex-with-colons(md5(pubkey)), and newer versions can do the old fingerprint for compatibility (see option <code>FingerprintHash</code> in <code>ssh_config</code> for <code>ssh</code> and flag <code>-E</code> in <code>ssh-keygen</code>).</p>

<p>And to be clear this is only the <em>OpenSSH</em> fingerprint. Key fingerprints are also used in the PGP and X.509/PKIX (SSL/TLS, CMS/SMIME, etc) worlds and they are entirely different.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT HAS TO BE ACHIEVED</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Generate SECP256K1 key pair</li>
<li>Use public key for account creation on a blockchain</li>
<li>Store private key to Key Vault and use it for signing purposes</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>ATTEMPT #1 - GENERATE OUTSIDE KEY VAULT AND IMPORT</strong></p>

<p>I have generated SECP256K1 key pair outside Key Vault. As a result I have private key and public key available as strings.
My idea was to import the private key to Key Vault with help of Azure SDK for.NET wia following piece of code (ECParameters used are from Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault.WebKey.ECParameters namespace):</p>

<pre><code>  //this part of code is taken from https://www.scottbrady91.com/C-Sharp/JWT-Signing-using-ECDSA-in-dotnet-Core
  var privateKeyBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(privateKey);
  var privateKeyInt =
    new Org.BouncyCastle.Math.BigInteger(+1, privateKeyBytes);
  var parameters = SecNamedCurves.GetByName(""secp256k1"");
  var ecPoint = parameters.G.Multiply(privateKeyInt);
  var privateKeyX = ecPoint.Normalize().XCoord.ToBigInteger()
    .ToByteArrayUnsigned();
  var privateKeyY = ecPoint.Normalize().YCoord.ToBigInteger()
    .ToByteArrayUnsigned();

  //the following part is my code
  var ecParameters = new ECParameters();
  ecParameters.Curve = ""P-256K"";
  ecParameters.X = privateKeyX;
  ecParameters.Y = privateKeyY;
  ecParameters.D = privateKeyBytes;

  var key = new JsonWebKey(ecParameters);
  JsonWebKeyVerifier.Options options =
    JsonWebKeyVerifier.Options.DenyIncompatibleOperations
    | JsonWebKeyVerifier.Options.DenyExtraneousFields;
  string error = (string) null;

  JsonWebKeyVerifier.VerifyByKeyType(key, options, ref error);

  await client.ImportKeyWithHttpMessagesAsync(vaultBaseUri, name, key);
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting key for import looks like this (copied from Visual Studio variable view, maybe it's shortened):</p>

<pre><code>  {
    ""kty"": ""EC"",
    ""crv"": ""P-256K"",
    ""x"": ""vSUHj6deEhPI6QeILgfgf2I7VTgmiDon_5nsss560OA"",

  }
</code></pre>

<p>Although JsonWebKeyVerifier returns no error and a call to key.IsValid() returns true, the call to Key Vault failed with HTTP 400 Bad Request. I have turn on logging on Key Vault instance and following log appears there (id, username, IP addresses and GUIDs are changed intentionally, I'm not sure what is confidential; I can provide them on demand):</p>

","<p>As described, the scheme seems reasonable in that it should allow someone to send another person a message that only the recipient can read.  There are some items that come to mind that you may have already thought about but left out for brevity:</p>

<ul>
<li>When encrypting the private key, use something like PBKDF2 with salt and some fairly large number it iterations.</li>
<li>This is probably implied, but rather than encrypt with the public key, it probably makes sense to generate a random key (e.g., 32-bytes of random data if using, for example, AES-256). Encrypt the message with that key, encrypt the key with the public key, and send both pieces.</li>
<li>As described, there is no identification of the sender.  It allows purely anonymous messages to be sent. This might be intended, but if not, then some kind of identification/authentication would be necessary.</li>
<li>Somewhat similar to the previous entry, no message authentication is described. The attacker could change the encrypted message and the recipient would not be able to tell that it was changed.  Although, if it is a text message, it would be pretty clear that it had been modified, because it would be just garbled text. There are some types of data, though, that might not be so easy to tell if it had been modified.</li>

","<p>If I understand correctly, you want to create a system where two users can initiate private communication through a server that they do not trust.</p>

<p>This won't work.</p>

<p>In the scenario you lay out, the server can generate its own key pair, and publish its public key in place of the users'. When a user encrypts a message, intending it for their partner, they can't detect that the server has substituted its public key. The server decrypts the message, presents it to the server admins, and re-encrypts it (or some new message that they fabricated) with the real partner public key, and forwards it to the destination.</p>

<p>What's missing here is a certificate authority. This is a trusted third party that digitally signs a binding between a public key and a user name. This binding is called a certificate. This way, when the server presents a public key to a client to use for encryption, the client can use the CA's public key to verify the certificate, and be assured that the public key they are about to encrypt with belongs to the intended recipient, and not an attacker.</p>

<p>The users have to trust the CA, which might be more palatable than trusting the server administrators. But, there must also be a tamper-proof way to store the CA certificate. In practice, this is often done using a password-based MAC (message authentication code). Or, the CA could be digitally signed with the user's private key (never seen this done, but it would work). But the tricky part would be getting the CA certificate from a trusted source, bypassing the untrustworthy server.</p>

<p>As far as encrypting the private key with the password, that is done very often, and is as safe as the password you choose.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if the users can share a secret with each other out-of-band, you don't need public key encryption. The client could encrypt the shared secret with a user-selected password, and store the cipher text on the server.</p>

","<p>This sounds something like what hushmail did. However, there was a major problem in that, since they had the private key of the users (encrypted) they just had to push down a hacked java applet which would transmit the user's password to the server (which they did).</p>

<p>A much better solution is to avoid having that private key on the server at all. With the requirement of no local storage, that's out.</p>

<p>The long and short of it is that yes, you may re-use your public key for multiple accounts, but your first consideration is a little underweight; if your private key were compromised, <strong>all of your accounts would be compromised</strong>. If the various accounts have different expectations of security, you might want to consider using different key pairs.</p>

<p>Your email address associated with your key is for identification purposes. It has to do with the key in that it is IN the key, but it does not impact the functionality of the key.</p>

<p>If you did generate a different key pair, you can tie different keys to different hosts via ~/.ssh/config. Instructions to do should be pretty easy to find.</p>

The Mac Mini with a WD MyBook is being replaced by a Synology DiskStation. On of the backup scripts i have been using to synchronize my external HDD with VMs stopped working properly after relocation the backup destination to the Synology. The script basically starts a rsync process in a SSH session per file. Details of the script can be found here; <a href=""http://www.reddipped.com/2016/07/speeding-vm-backups-using-rsync/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddipped.com/2016/07/speeding-vm-backups-using-rsync/</a></p>

<h1>Client configuration (Mac OS X Sierra)</h1>

<li>Create the private/public keypair </li>
</ul>

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh Peter\ van\ Nes@newyork 'cat - &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
ssh Peter\ van\ Nes@newyork 'chmod 644 .ssh/authorized_keys'
ssh Peter\ van\ Nes@newyork 'chmod 755 ~ ~/.ssh'

</ul>

<h2>Server (Synology)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Open SSH session to Synology</p>

<pre><code>ssh ""Peter van Nes""@newyork
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Edit sshd_config</p>

<pre><code>vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

<pre><code># restart ssh-shell
synoservicectl --restart ssh-shell
# restart rsync daemon
synoservicectl --restart rsyncd   
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>After completing these steps i am able to logon using a public key successfully. When running the script it initially runs as expected, only after a few thousand files the passphrase for the key has to be entered again.</p>

<p>before the include (in your case, in <code>.../modal.php</code>) to see what paths PHP is running/configured with.</p>

<pre><code>set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . '/path/to/libraries');

<p>or update the <code>include_path</code> directive in your php.ini config file.</p>

<p>Also, I see that you start your path with <code>./</code>.  This means ""in the current directory"".  So, does <code>libraries</code> exist in the same directory as <code>model.php</code>?  If not, then you want the path to just be <code>google-api-php-client/src/Google/Client.php</code> after you add the <code>/path/to/libraries</code> to your <code>include_path</code>.</p>

","<p>The protocol specification must be incorrect. Digital signatures are signed with your private key.</p>

<p>Your certificate needs to <em>accompany</em> the message, and probably be included in the signature. Use the java.security.Signature class in association with your private key, possibly loaded from your KeyStore.</p>

<p>You may need to purchase a signing certificate: an SSL certificate may not be strong enough for bitcoin.</p>

<p>A signature using a public key is completely worthless. Anyone can do it. You sign with your private key. This is legally equivalent to your signature: only you can do it, and anyone can check it by verifying it with your public key, which is why the public key must accompany the signature; and at the same time they can establish whose signature it is, via the certificate which must also accompany the signature.</p>

SFTP - LAP + host key  </p>

","<p>The host key checking indeed contributes to the security of the SSH/SFTP. Though it is in no way related to the authentication (password). So it's not like there are ""levels of security"" that combine these two aspects.</p>

<p>Moreover, your probably confuse the host key checking with the public key authentication.</p>

<p>Read my <a href=""https://winscp.net/eng/docs/ssh_keys"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article on SSH keys</a> to understand the difference between the host key and the key used for authentication.</p>

<p>Host key checking: You should never set the <code>StrictHostKeyChecking</code> to <code>no</code>, unless you connect within a private network, where you do not expect any kind of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">man-in-the-middle attacks</a>.</p>

<p>Authentication: If possible, use the public key authentications. The password authentication is less secure.</p>

<p>I am using the same key that was generated by IPSwitch and have named it as id_rsa in my eclipse. Is the private key generated out of IPSwitch supposed to work for JSch as well?</p>

<p>When I connect via IPSwitch, it works all fine. Could you please help me here?Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>Thanks to  Martin Prikryl and the community for being with this while I solve this problem. </p>

<p>It was simple. As Martin mention one of his comment, I just had to generate one more set of keys using another tool like SSH-Keygen and use it instead. I used a software called VANDYKE SecureCRT to generate one more set of keys and it works just fine with JSch. Looks like IPSwitch does something while generating keys which does not seem to work with JSch. It could be that 'Pass' which is available in the config file of IPSwitch, which is specific to IPSwitch. </p>

<p>Code is as follows,</p>

<pre><code>        JSch jsch = new JSch();
        jsch.addIdentity(privateKeyPath);


        JSch.setLogger(new com.jcraft.jsch.Logger() {
            Path path = Paths.get(""target/jsch.log"");
            @Override
            public boolean isEnabled(int level){

            }

                }
            }

Is there some programmatic way of proving a key once belonged to the owner of the email account that sent the signed email? My google-fu is failing me on this one.</p>

<p>Update: ""non-repudiation"" is the word I was looking for. Still researching...</p>
","<p>Most of the time non-repudiation is achieved with cryptographic time-stamps. A time-stamp is a proof of existence of a document at a given time and is issued by a trustworthy third-party with sign the document hash along with the time at which this document was submitted.</p>

<p>I do not know GPG model very well but there is probably something like a certificate which binds the public key with the key owner identity. You have to time-stamp this certificate. Actually you should also time-stamp a proof that that Bob's key is not revoked. In X.509 this is achieved by time-stamping the current revocation list which proves the ""not revoked"" status the key.</p>

<p>For simplicity, let's say server A(manager - which is installed first) and server B have the application installed. </p>

<p>Let's say when server B installed, server A's public key will be available in server B. </p>

<p>Also assume server A will make the first request to server B. When doing so,  the server A will get server B's public key during the handshake(by verifying the fingerprint, the key will be saved in server A) and server A will send its public key to server B for authentication. As server B already has the server A's public key, authentication successful?.</p>

<p>When server B wants to request server A, the server A will send its public key during the handshake and it is verified against the server A's public key available in server B.

<p>Let's say Alice wants to send a message to Bob. She need to let Bob know the message is from her. So she encrypted the hashed message with her private key into a certificate. Then Bob can decrypted the message with public key when receiving it. Bob can know it is from Alice if the hash code of the message matches the hash code which is decrypted from certificate. Here we have the assumption that Bob already knows the public key. What if the transmission of public key is already attacked? Bob might use the wrong public key to decrypt the wrong message and get that the message if from Alice. Is there any protocal or policy to avoid the attack against public key? And shall we？</p>
","<p>Yes, the authenticity of public keys is a key component of applied cryptography. I can issue a public key that says ""I am the website of your bank, trust me"", but you shouldn't really trust it. Different schemes have been developed to establish authentication of public keys. One approach is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust"" rel=""nofollow"">web of trust model</a> in PGP and GnuPG, others are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509"" rel=""nofollow"">PKI</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_%28protocol%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Kerberos</a>. One of the main difference between these approaches is where you place your trust. I provide a <strong>simplified description</strong> only, you have to read about them to learn about the exact details (you wouldn't base your security on an extremely short summary, would you?).</p>

<p>In the <strong>web of trust</strong> there are some people who you trust, and you (ideally) verified their public keys personally. You can trust other public keys if they have been signed by several people bearing your initial trust. Using these trusted individuals you can check more and more keys.</p>

<p>In <strong>PKI</strong> (Personal Key Infrastructure) you trust several <strong>Certificate Authorities</strong> (CAs) and accept their public keys. You trust them that they thoroughly check the identity of key holders before signing their public keys. The combination of public key + signature from a CA (and some other data) forms a <strong>certificate</strong>. The PKI is used in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security"" rel=""nofollow"">SSL/TLS</a>, it is the underlying infrastructure of the secure web. You use it when you read your mail on a web interface, when you do online banking, etc. If a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority#Subversion_of_CA"" rel=""nofollow"">CA is compromised</a>, then every certificate signed by the CA will be come insecure.</p>

<p>In <strong>Kerberos</strong> is designed for computer networks and the <strong>key server</strong> is the single point of trust.

<p>Let's say Alice wants to send a message to Bob. She need to let Bob know the message is from her. So she encrypted the hashed message with her private key into a certificate. Then Bob can decrypted the message with public key when receiving it. Bob can know it is from Alice if the hash code of the message matches the hash code which is decrypted from certificate. Here we have the assumption that Bob already knows the public key. What if the transmission of public key is already attacked? Bob might use the wrong public key to decrypt the wrong message and get that the message if from Alice. Is there any protocal or policy to avoid the attack against public key? And shall we？</p>

  <p>This is an example of a self-signed certificate, as the issuer and subject are the same. There's no way to verify this certificate except by checking it against itself; instead, these top-level certificates are manually stored by web browsers. Thawte is one of the root certificate authorities recognized by both Microsoft and Netscape. This certificate comes with the web browser and is trusted by default.</p>

","<p>In the environment you described and illustrated in your question, in order to initiate a encrypted comunication, the <code>Initiator</code> has to encrypt the data with the <code>Responder</code> <code>public key</code>, so when the <code>Responder</code> receives a message, will be able to decrypt it with its <code>private key</code>.</p>

<p>So the authorities described in the diagrams, play the roles of <code>public-key</code> distribution, and trust authority, confirming that users are really who they say they are. This means that by uploading a <code>public key</code> or sign ing a <code>public certificate</code> with these authorities, you are just providing other users/machines a mechanism to comunicate with you in a secure maner.</p>

<p>If you want to cancel that public key/certificate from being available, or in other words, prevent your key/certificate to be available to anyone to initiate a secure comunication with you, is the authority who has control over it, becasue it lies in their database, and this is why, you should ask them to revoke the key or the certificate.</p>

"39260300","Preventing JSON domain spoofing","<p>Here's the scenario. A customer already has an eCommerce site where they are collecting shipping address info and credit card data. However, they sign up with a SaaS service that allows them to easily change their credit card form <strong>to also collect fullnames and emails</strong> (not credit card info) into a marketing system for other purposes. So, they paste a jQuery snippet into their page from the SaaS service and add some ""data-"" attributes to their form and form field tags so that the SaaS service knows what to intercept and where to what SaaS account to post the data.</p>

<p>Okay, but then a security problem occurs. Let's say we have two separate customers in that SaaS system. One is named Jack and owns jack.com, and his account ID is 100001. The other is Nancy, nancy.com, and 100002. Jack could add the snippet into his form and add some ""data-"" attributes, but then screw up and set his account ID in one of those data- attributes to 100002 instead of 100001. This would mean that Nancy would suddenly see Jack's data in her account. Not good! The fix, of course, is to have some setting in Jack's SaaS account so that he only accepts data from jack.com, and Nancy only accepts data from nancy.com.</p>

<p>But then a potential exploit happens. All a hacker has to do is create a spoof page on his own server where he forms similar JSON and, via a /etc/hosts file change on his workstation, makes it appear that he's jack.com. He could then fire in thousands upon thousands of bogus marketing form information into Jack's account because the SaaS service thinks it's coming from jack.com.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do in the jQuery code, or the PHP code used by the SaaS service, to ensure that a hacker can't spoof like that and that only Jack's real customer data gets sent?</p>

<p><strong>ANSWERED QUESTIONS</strong></p>

<p>Q1. ""How do you identify Jack and Nancy? By domain?""</p>

<p>A1. Jack has his domain jack.com. Nancy has her domain nancy.com. Each use this marketing SaaS service, but each are also co-opting an eCommerce form they already had before they signed up for the SaaS service. They were told in the SaaS docs, ""Just drop the scraper.js in your form page and add these data- tags to your form tag and html input, textarea, and select tags so that the scraper.js can intercept those form submits temporarily, glean the marketing data (full name and email, let's say) from that form, and then let that form submit on its workflow that you already had. The data- attributes would identify which account is to be used, as well as which marketing campaign and sub-campaign where this data should be stored at the SaaS service."" However, in the jQuery of scraper.js, it was going to pass in the JSON the location.href property so that it knows what domain was used -- jack.com or nancy.com, in this particular instance. Trouble is -- the location.href can be spoofed by a hacker who sets up an /etc/hosts file entry of 127.0.0.1 for jack.com on his workstation and runs a copy of the same JSON code.</p>

<p>Q2. ""What if you could use a callback mechanism from SaaS.com to jack.com? So, one of your data- attributes would specify the callback function to receive data back from SaaS.com, and then only save data when it gets the right response?""</p>

<p>A2. Now that's an interesting take. Yeah, so I could like drop an extra PHP page on jack.com that emits ""OK"". When SaaS.com receives a JSON data post from jack.com, it sends a request to that second PHP callback page on jack.com with file_get_contents() to ensure it not only gets the OK response back, but also gets a match on IP address and SSL certificate data. If the two are different, then most likely the request was a bogus hacker request and the transaction can be security logged and rejected. (I can do the IP address verification easily, but am not certain how to verify the same two SSL certificates in PHP, if that's even allowed or possible.) Of course, IP addresses can be spoofed.</p>

<p>Another layer of security on this is that this second PHP page can use a public/private key exchange communication check between SaaS.com and jack.com instead of simply emitting ""OK"".</p>

<p>Q3. ""Why would you want to intercept payment information and send that off through Javascript?""</p>

<p>A3. Absolutely not. Never specified sending payment information in this question. Was saying something like Full Name and Email, instead. Yes, SSL communication would need to be used as well in order to send that data securely. And, we'd have to use <a href=""https://stripe.com/blog/stripejs-and-jsonp"" rel=""nofollow"">JSONP to get around the CORS problem</a>.</p>

<p>Q4. ""Wouldn't that require jack.com to have everything saved in a database for verification? If so, why bother with the SaaS app?""</p>

<p>A4. Nope. Not at all. Check out the answer A2. With that mechanism, the SaaS app receives the data, but doesn't trust it until 2 things happen:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It calls back to jack.com to a second page, and ensures that the response it gets back has the same IP address as the one that sent the form data in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>It does a public/private key exchange check (which the hacker can't spoof obviously unless they have server access) in that second page to ensure that IP spoofing wasn't occurring.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Q5. Wait a minute. A2 and A4 have a problem. The IP address of the initial sending request will be from the user's workstation, not the server. So, you can't validate IP that way. You'll have to use another mechanism to validate that someone completed the form at jack.com and that it wasn't from a hacker spoofing jack.com.</p>

<p>A5. You're absolutely right. Forgot about that I guess because I'm slightly distracted on another project. I'll have to give this some more thought.</p>
","<p>TL;DR: If you're using a purely client-side integration (just javascript), there's no way to completely secure the request.</p>

<h3>Accidentally/intentionally sending data to the wrong client</h3>

<p>You can mitigate this by using non-sequential, random UUIDs as account IDs.  For example, if an account ID looks like 100001, then someone might try using the account ID 100002; however, if the account ID looks like <code>c3f80e491d44cd91664a0459a0777ed01</code>, it's statistically unlikely that someone will be able to send data to an unknown account.</p>

<h3>Intentional spam/fictional submissions</h3>

<p>This is a problem with any form that stores data on the internet; I'm not aware of any way around this without help from some server side code.</p>

<p>You can generate a one-time token to be included with the json payload - this can be something like a dated JWT token secured via HMAC, or a set message encrypted with a shared secret key which would then be de-duped by the SAAS server.</p>

<p>If you're going to start involve server-side programming, then this additional negotiation process becomes a bit irrelevant - it's far easier to the just give the e-commerce site an API key, and let them post the customer information over when they receive an order.</p>

<p>So, I'm playing around with Crypto++ so that I can make a signature of a file to see if the file has been edited by someone other than me. The test application that comes with the library looks like it has options (rs and rv) that do exactly what I want to do in my own program (verify the integrity of the signature of a file). Of course, before doing that I need to generate a public and private key. When doing so with the test application's g option it asks me to specify the key length in bits. What difference does the key length make?</p>
","<p>The key length determines how hard it is for someone to break your cryptography. For digital signatures, that means how hard is it for someone to generate a fake signature.</p>

<p>For RSA a key length of 1024 bits is sufficient for non-sensitive information, but it should only be used for a few years and then replaced with a new key. 2048 bits is stronger and 4096 is stronger still.</p>

<p>For a naive brute-force attacker, adding a single bit to the key length doubles the amount of work they need to do to compromise your key. However, algorithms like RSA do not scale in this way: a 2048-bit RSA key is not 2^1024 times as hard to break as a 1024-bit key (unless the attacker is <strong>really</strong> stupid).</p>

<p>Generally <em>public key</em> algorithms (e.g. RSA) need much larger keys than <em>symmetric key</em> algorithms (e.g. AES) because they rely on different mathematical properties.</p>

<p>For a good primer on cryptography you should check out <a href=""http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/tutorial/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Peter Gutmann's godzilla crypto tutorial</a>. It's pretty readable and gives you a good overview of how crypto works in its various forms.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>The client wants to make a request to the API, so asks for a nonce from the server - passing their public key.</p>

<hr>

<p>The server lookups the users private key (using the provided public key) and hashes it (sha256) with a random 32 character string (the nonce).</p>

<p>The server then responds to the client with the un-hashed version of the nonce.</p>

<p>The client takes the nonce from the response and also hashes it with it's private key (which the client has locally).</p>

<h2>A couple of general thoughts</h2>

<p>It seems like you want to roll your own which is <strong>a bad idea</strong> in any security-related area. Even more so when there are several alternatives in the wild that have been battle-tested.</p>

<p>Off the top of my head, I can name three ways for API authentication that are in wide use:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Basic authentication.</strong> Github provides this as a <a href=""https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/"" rel=""nofollow"">fall-back</a>: “intended to be used for scripts or testing (i.e., cases where full OAuth would be overkill).”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OAuth.</strong> Github, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google all use this. This protocol is well-specified but might be overkill for smaller projects. Thanks to widespread client library, it's fairly easy to implement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hash-based message authentication code (HMAC).</strong> All Amazon Webservices use this. This might be the most under-appreciated solution since it's conceptually easier than OAuth: The client uses its private key to sign requests and send the signature + public key in the request. The server looks up the private key using the public key sent by the client and in turn creates a signature of the request. If the signatures match, the request is valid. Public and private keys have to be exchanged beforehand (AWS lets you download the private key once).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>From what you describe, HMAC is the closest candidate to what you want.</p>

<h2>A couple of thoughts specific to what you suggested</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Your algorithm requires you to <strong>keep state on the server</strong> (cue “local array”). This is fine for a single server, but what do you do when you scale? When step #2 hits one server and step #3 another, the state has to be shared. You can of course use a shared DB (or cache) or whatever, but you have to think about this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roundtrips.</strong> Requiring a 2-step authentication like you suggested, every client has to either send an additional request (to get the nonce) for each (payload) request or you have think about when to invalidate your pairs on the server. <strong>HMAC essentially does the same thing without request overhead.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Possible attack:</strong> I can flood your servers with client requests for nonces. Depending on your public key length, I might come up with valid public keys and I can tie up resources that are never used for the second request. Depending on how you handle that (see also point #1), I might bring your server down.</p></li>

"55341115","How to generate RSA public key from private key?","<p>I was reading a question on SO and find out that we can generate the public key from private key using <code>openssl</code> in python. Now I wonder how this works(the mathematics part) and  how can I implement the method in python or in C, without using the <code>openssl</code> or any other library ?</p>
","<p>If the private key is stored in CRT format (Chinese Remainder Theorem), there is no math involved; the format includes the public exponent. This is how OpenSSL tools ""create"" a public key from a private key.</p>

<p>If the private is not stored in CRT format, it's generally not feasible to compute the public exponent given the private exponent. You can, however, guess common public exponents and easily verify your guess.</p>

<p>Mathematically, in order to quickly compute one exponent using the other, you need to know the totient, a number computed from the factors of the modulus. And of course the security of RSA is predicated on the infeasibility of factoring the modulus. This relationship is symmetrical; it doesn't matter whether you know the public exponent and try to compute the private exponent, or vice-versa.</p>

"52797337","How to generate entropy by myself? - RSA Golang","<p>I'm working with Golang's RSA encryption library. The following is the function to encrypt a message:</p>

<pre><code>func EncryptOAEP(hash hash.Hash, random io.Reader, pub *PublicKey, msg []byte, label []byte) ([]byte, error)
</code></pre>

<p>The random parameter is used as a source of entropy to ensure that encrypting the same message twice doesn't result in the same ciphertext. This parameter allow to use linux functions like getrandom(2) if available or /dev/urandom otherwise that serves as a random number generator by accessing environmental noise collected from devices and other sources. I don't want the EncryptOAEP function to use the functions of the operating system (getrandom(2) or /dev/urandom) to generate the random number. I need to generate a random number by myself (that is, outside the EncryptOAEP function) and then insert it into it. Is that possible with this library? In case it is not, what Golang's library could I use to achieve this behavior? I hope I was clear enough, any help will be appreciated, thanks!</p>

"54390330","RSA key signing and verifying in Java(Android)","<p>I am having a slight problem with understanding the concept of RSA signing and verifying.
The problem is that I can create key pair (public and private key) which is perfectly fine.</p>

<pre><code>        KeyPairGenerator keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"");
        random = SecureRandom.getInstance(""SHA1PRNG"");
        keyGen.initialize(2048, random);
        KeyPair pair = keyGen.generateKeyPair();
        myPrivateKey = pair.getPrivate();
        myPublicKey = pair.getPublic();
</code></pre>

<p>Signing and verifying are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>        //Singing with private key
        Signature s = Signature.getInstance(""SHA1withRSA"");
        s.initSign(javaPrivateKey);

        //Verifying with public key
        Signature s = Signature.getInstance(""SHA1withRSA"");
        s.initVerify(javaPublicKey);
</code></pre>

<p>When I print myPrivateKey and myPublicKey, I see modulus(n) and public exponent(e) are the same for public and private key.</p>

<p>I have converted public and private keys to base64 and hex and I get the different values which is perfectly fine. However, I cannot sign the message with base64 or hex. I can sign it only with what I get from this: </p>

<pre><code>         myPrivateKey = pair.getPrivate();  
</code></pre>

<p>I am aware of that verifying needs to be done with the public key which is visible to everyone. When the message is verified by the receiver, does the receiver use modulus and exponent only? What part of the public key needs to be shared by the sender? Modulus and exponent or Base64 or hex value of the key?</p>
","<p>Yes, the receiver uses modulus and exponent only; there are no other components that are required mathematically speaking to verify a signature for RSA.</p>

<p>The mathematical operations are performed using large numbers (<code>BigInteger</code> values commonly when RSA is implemented in software). To perform any kind of calculation the implementation must regenerate these numbers. How these numbers are transmitted doesn't matter to the algorithm.</p>

<p>Commonly RSA public keys are encoded using something based on PKCS#1, which specifies the public key format using ASN.1 (which defines the structure) and BER/DER (which defines the encoding of that structure). Of course, different protocols may use different encodings of public keys. PGP for instance uses an entirely different ""package format"" to encode keys.</p>

<hr>

<p>Java however returns a SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure which is defines in the X.509 (certificate and CRL) specifications; besides the modulus and exponent is also contains an algorithm identifier to show that it <em>is</em> an RSA public key. So this structure can also be used to distribute other kind of key values. It can be retrieved by calling <code>getEncoded()</code> on the <code>RSAPublicKey</code> instance - assuming that this instance is compatible with the Oracle provided one - they generally are. Android's implementations certainly should be compatible with this structure. Note that the SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure contains the PKCS#1 public key structure <em>inside of it</em>.</p>

<p>To reverse you need an <code>KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"")</code> and derive the key using <code>X509EncodedKeySpec</code>, initialized with the given byte array.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>If</strong> you need textual strings instead of binary then you can convert the bytes returned by <code>getEncoded()</code> into base 64 and hexadecimals. Of course, in that case, you need to reverse the encoding (i.e. decode) the result before being able to decode the bytes themselves.</p>

<p>It is also possible to encode the modulus and public exponent yourself. You can retrieve them using <code>RSAPublicKey.getModulus()</code> and <code>RSAPublicKey.getPublicExponent()</code>. To reverse them back into an <code>RSAPublicKey</code> you can use <code>KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"")</code> and <code>RSAPublicKeySpec</code>. That way you can for instance just create a string <code>""(&lt;modulus&gt;, &lt;exp&gt;)""</code> and use that to distribute the key. Generally you would want to keep to predefined standards though.</p>

<hr>

<p>Not covered in this answer is the fact that to verify with a public key you first need to establish <em>trust</em> in the public key. If you cannot trust the public key then you don't know who created the public key. In that case you can also not trust the result of your verification operation; the signature may have been created with a key pair of an adversary. Delving into Public Key Infrastructures (PKI / PKIX) is a bit too much for this answer though.</p>

<p>Likewise: SHA-1 is not considered secure anymore, <em>especially</em> for signature generation / verification. You would want to use at least <code>SHA256withRSA</code> or - slightly more advanced and somewhat more secure - an RSA scheme that uses PSS. 2048 bits is ever so slightly too small for comfort; using a 4096 bit key is advisable if your scheme allows it.</p>

<p>2) Yes, you should probably do this via the ""system function"" of a shell script (or system/popen, if you absolutely need to have the results inside a C program), as that will save you a great deal of trouble reimplementing things.</p>

<p>3) Public keys, yes; and while it's possible to reuse public keys on multiple hosts/users, it's not good security practice; better would be generating a keypair for each user/host and then adding the public key to .ssh/authorized_keys on the machine you need to connect to. This means that revoking keys is simply removing a line in a single text file instead of regenerating a key for multiple hosts. However, if it's not security-sensitive, or if security just plain doesn't matter in this instance(!), then using a single key may not be too insane. That is, if you need multiple clients to check for existence on a single host; if not, please update your question to be clearer in this regard.</p>

<pre><code>Host bitbucket.org
 IdentityFile /var/www/.ssh/id_rsa
</code></pre>
","<p>It is the public key that should go to BitBucket, while the private key should most likely go to the default location <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code>.</p>

<p>Mind that if you overwrite whatever existing private key is there, you will lose access to those systems you had originally access to. Better to generate or provide the matching public key to whatever private key is already located at <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code>.</p>

<p>If you do want to store a custom private key separate from it's default location, then that will have to be customized in your git settings.</p>

<p>To summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure you have a private key stored at <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code>.</li>
<li>Send the matching public key to BitBucket.</li>
<li>You can store for safekeeping a copy of the public key at <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa/pub</code>. It will however not be used.</li>
<li>Make sure that privileges are set right for the following directories:

<ul>
<li>Your home directory (<code>~</code>)</li>
<li>The <code>~/.ssh</code> directory</li>
<li>The private key - <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code>.</li>
<li>and several other important files under <code>~/.ssh</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>You can use following script to get privileges fixed if it is broken:</p>

<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code>chmod go-w ~
[[ ! -d ~/.ssh ]] &amp;&amp; mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh

[[ -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa ]] &amp;&amp; chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
[[ -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ]] &amp;&amp; chmod 640 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
[[ -f ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ]] &amp;&amp; chmod 640 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

chown ${USER}: ~
chown -R ${USER}: ~/.ssh
</code></pre>

<p>This should in most cases fix privilege related issues, as ssh will refuse to work if not setup right. If you have it any other way, you leave your system potentially vulnerable to an attack, and even if ssh doesn't work yet, your private key could get corrupted by an attack, or stolen.</p>

<p>Make sure the sample script did not get modified from it's original version (no stackoverflow edits by others), unless it was properly documented as to why the edit happened.</p>

"50336118","Why bitcoin address instead of public key?","<p>In asymmetric encryption it is quite common to publish your public key to others. With the public key everyone can verify signatures created with the according private key.</p>

<p>So why do crypto-currencies like bitcoin not simply use the public key as the output of a transaction directly?</p>

<p>Bitcoin is instead using a so called <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">address</a>. What is the reason instead of just using the curve25519 public key?</p>
","<p>There are basically two advantages to publishing an address, i.e., a RIPEMD-160 hash of the public key, instead of the public key directly:</p>

<ul>
<li>The hash is only 160 bits compared to 256 bits of public key, so we safe about 1/3 of the space that we'd use when directly using public keys. This is both data transferred and stored at the endpoints. While the transferred size is pretty clear, storage comes in two forms as well: UTXO set size and on disk size.</li>
<li>Some limited protection against ECDSA being broken: should it become computationally feasible to create a signature given a public key, because of a weakness being discovered, we can avoid all funds being stolen by having this level of indirection. Assuming that it takes a while to generate a valid signature we can switch the signature algorithm, and the owners in possession of the private key still have a timing advantage w.r.t. an attacker, which would have to grab the public key from the wire, turn around and quickly compute a signature to a competing transaction.</li>

"31596663","How is the process of signing and verifying a release and why apache says that the signature file signed by a public key?","<p>I have started learning GPG and I am a bit confused about the infos I have found. The <a href=""https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x135.html"" rel=""nofollow"">GnuPG documentation</a> says that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A signature is created using the <strong>private key</strong> of the signer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But at the <a href=""http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing#verifying-signature"" rel=""nofollow"">Apache's site</a>, they say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The signature file is a digest of the original file signed by a <strong>public key</strong>...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And on the <a href=""http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing#detach-sig"" rel=""nofollow"">same site, in another section</a>, they say the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A digital signature is created from an original document using a <strong>private key</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I suppose that the process of signing involves signing the hash of a release using the private key of the holder and not the public one like Apache says in the second link I have posted, or am I wrong? Otherwise, how could someone be ever able to decrypt the hash of a release signed with a public key if he/she doesn't have the private key of the holder? </p>

<p>Then, could someone simply explain in what the processes of signing and verifying a signature consist and what are the passages, e.g. for a software release like <a href=""https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi?Preferred=ftp://apache.mirrors.tds.net/pub/apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Apache Maven</a>?</p>
","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: There is a mistake in the documentation, your understanding of signatures is right.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The signature file is a digest of the original file signed by a public [sic, this is should be private] key...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Signing a document usually is performed by calculating the hash sum of the document (asymmetric cryptography is very slow for large amounts of data), which finally is <em>encrypted</em> using the private key, so anybody can <em>decrypt</em> it using the public key. If the decryption process results in the same hash sum as is calculated from the original document, it must have been encrypted using the private key - which is only known to the signer; thus the authorship is verified.</p>

<p>Encryption (leaving apart the aspect of hybrid cryptosystems like OpenPGP is, but the general concept stays the same) works the other way round; the public key is used for encryption, so only the private key can be used to decrypt the information.</p>

<p>I added a <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-10040"" rel=""nofollow"">bug report for the documentation issue</a> (closed/fixed since 2015-07-29).</p>

<blockquote>

<li>You need to fetch the public key used for signing the software (usually, you will download it from a keyserver using <code>gpg --recv-key [key-id]</code>.</li>
<li>Verify the key's integrity, for example by speaking with the developers, your web of trust, the products HTTPs-encrypted website (depending on how paranoid you're at verifying the authorship).</li>
<li>Issue a signature to certify the key if it is not already verified through your web of trust, if you don't want to create a public one, there are also local signatures which are never transmitted to the key server network.</li>
<li>Finally, use <code>gpg --verify</code> to check that the signature was indeed issued by the product maintainer's key.</li>

","<p>What you initially refer to is symmetric encryption (shared key), which allows 2 entities to communicate securely based on a single shared key that is only known to the two entities.  This key can be exchanged several ways, but can't be publicized for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Asymmetric encryption (public/private key) allows 2 entities to communicate securely as follows:</p>

<p>If one party wants to accept secure (encrypted) information, they need a key that isn't visible to the world (private), but they also have to be able to provide a key to anyone who wants to send encrypted information (public).</p>

<p>So I can give my public key out to the whole world and know the data is secure since only I have the private key, therefore I'm the only one who can decrypt it.</p>

"33479597","Private and public key separately","<p>οκ!I want to establish a client server communication oves SSL/TLS in java. The server is multithreaded. With openssl I acted as my own CA (created private key and self-signed certificate for the authority). Now I want to create keys and certs for my server and clients which are signed from the CA I created.</p>

<p>1)Do I have to create certs and keys from the prompt for every single client? Or is it another ""automated"" way eg with a script?</p>

<p>2) I have seen that this code for setting up keystores</p>

<pre>private void setupClientKeyStore() throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException 
    {
    clientKeyStore = KeyStore.getInstance( ""JKS"" );
    clientKeyStore.load( new FileInputStream( ""client1publickey.jks"" ),
                       ""password"".toCharArray() );
    }

    private void setupServerKeystore() throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException
    {
    InputStream keyStoreResource = new FileInputStream(""serverprivatekey.jks"");
    char[] keyStorePassphrase = ""password"".toCharArray();
    serverKeyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS"");
    serverKeyStore.load(keyStoreResource, keyStorePassphrase);
}
</pre>

<p>I have run the command to see what type of entries are these and client1publickey is a TrustedCert entry while serverprivatekey is a PrivateKey entry. This code is on my server class. I have this code on my client class <pre> private void setupServerKeystore() throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException {
    serverKeyStore = KeyStore.getInstance( ""JKS"" );
    serverKeyStore.load( new FileInputStream(""serverpublickwy.jks""), 
                        ""university"".toCharArray() );
  } 
   private void setupClientKeyStore() throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException {
    clientKeyStore = KeyStore.getInstance( ""JKS"" );
    clientKeyStore.load( new FileInputStream( ""client1privatekey.jks"" ),
                       ""university"".toCharArray() );}</pre>
The question is that how can I create these jks files separately? The publickey.jks file is cert, right? How can I have it in another file from the private key and be signed from CA? Or is it another way I can estabvlish connections between client/server? 
Firstly I had created the CA with openssl and then the two jks files for server and client included the certs and the key. Sorry for the english.</p>

"54758001","how to work with private keys and public keys in react app","<p>I am building an app where I need to decrypt messages using private keys.  The messages are encrypted with public keys that are previously communicated.  My question is, in a react type app environment (or more generic web app environment) what is the best practices in working with public/private keys?  I don't really want to store keys on behalf of the user, or is this something that is done by web apps?  Do I ask them to submit the private key every time there is data to be decrypted?  Is there a way to access the os key store from a react app?  Any recommendation is greatly appreciated.</p>

"56062594","OpenSSL ECDH setting peer's public key in C","<p>I'm trying to integrate ECDH using OpenSSL in my C-SDK (which we will refer to as client) which is running on <strong>Ubuntu</strong> and needed some help regarding how to set the peer's (server) public key on the client side and eventually generating the shared secret.</p>

<h3>Some details:</h3>

<ol>
<li>I am successfully generating a public key and can also generate a shared secret on the server side which has an embedded microcontroller using the <code>mbedTLS</code> library.</li>
<li>The public key I receive from the server is in the form of a <code>uint8_t</code> array of size <code>32 bytes</code>.</li>
<li>I now want to use OpenSSL's ECDH to generate the public key for server and the shared secret on the client side.</li>
</ol>

<p>I found a sample code on the <a href=""https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Elliptic_Curve_Diffie_Hellman"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenSSL wiki website</a> which is as below:</p>



<pre><code>#include &lt;openssl/evp.h&gt;
#include &lt;openssl/ec.h&gt;


unsigned char *ecdh(size_t *secret_len)
{
    EVP_PKEY_CTX *pctx, *kctx;
    EVP_PKEY_CTX *ctx;
    unsigned char *secret;
    EVP_PKEY *pkey = NULL, *peerkey, *params = NULL;
    /* NB: assumes pkey, peerkey have been already set up */

    /* Create the context for parameter generation */
    if(NULL == (pctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_id(EVP_PKEY_EC, NULL))) handleErrors();

    /* Initialise the parameter generation */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_paramgen_init(pctx)) handleErrors();

    /* We're going to use the ANSI X9.62 Prime 256v1 curve */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_ec_paramgen_curve_nid(pctx, NID_X9_62_prime256v1)) handleErrors();

    /* Create the parameter object params */
    if (!EVP_PKEY_paramgen(pctx, &amp;params)) handleErrors();

    /* Create the context for the key generation */
    if(NULL == (kctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new(params, NULL))) handleErrors();

    /* Generate the key */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_keygen_init(kctx)) handleErrors();
    if (1 != EVP_PKEY_keygen(kctx, &amp;pkey)) handleErrors();

    /* Get the peer's public key, and provide the peer with our public key -
     * how this is done will be specific to your circumstances */
    peerkey = get_peerkey(pkey);

    /* Create the context for the shared secret derivation */
    if(NULL == (ctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new(pkey, NULL))) handleErrors();

    /* Initialise */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_derive_init(ctx)) handleErrors();

    /* Provide the peer public key */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_derive_set_peer(ctx, peerkey)) handleErrors();

    /* Determine buffer length for shared secret */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_derive(ctx, NULL, secret_len)) handleErrors();

    /* Create the buffer */
    if(NULL == (secret = OPENSSL_malloc(*secret_len))) handleErrors();

    /* Derive the shared secret */
    if(1 != (EVP_PKEY_derive(ctx, secret, secret_len))) handleErrors();

    EVP_PKEY_CTX_free(ctx);
    EVP_PKEY_free(peerkey);
    EVP_PKEY_free(pkey);
    EVP_PKEY_CTX_free(kctx);
    EVP_PKEY_free(params);
    EVP_PKEY_CTX_free(pctx);

    /* Never use a derived secret directly. Typically it is passed
     * through some hash function to produce a key */
    return secret;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The example has a <code>peerkey = get_peerkey(pkey);</code> line where it sets the peerkey and basically leaves it on the user to implement this function. I would imagine it would be straightforward if I was using OpenSSL on the server side as well.</p>

<h3>My question:</h3>

<p>Referring to the above code,and keeping in mind that I'm receiving the server's public key as a <code>uint8_t</code> array, how do I set the <code>EVP_PKEY *peerkey</code> context so that it contains the server's public key?</p>

<p>If there's another straight-forward crypto library in C that I can use on Ubuntu then please do suggest!</p>

<p>Really appreciate any help.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

","<p>You can customize certificate checking by providing your own <code>javax.net.ssl.TrustManagerFactory</code> to Netty's <code>SslContextBuilder</code>. You'd probably want to implement <code>X509ExtendedTrustManager</code>, do your check, and then delegate to a ""real"" implementation for the rest of the cert chain checking.</p>

<p>You can do something like this to get the default-configuration <code>TrustManagerFactory</code>:</p>

<p>When I extract it, it's always not 1024 bits, but more. Has that something to do with padding or...? Looks like 136 bytes at the moment, so 64 bit too much. Not sure whether this is a constant or depends on the certificate</p>

<p>edit:
I retried with <code>openssl x509 -modulus -inform PER -in file.cer</code> and it resulted in 128 bytes. Guess that's it.</p>

<p>edit2:
So, this still is my problem. I did <code>openssl x509 -inform DER -in file.cer -text</code> and got a modulus of 129 bytes. Is my assumption correct that I can skip the first one because it is <code>0x00</code> which might just be used to make the whole thing positive again (first byte otherwise would be a <code>0xaa</code> which might be negative)?</p>

<p>I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, are there any security settings I might need to change to prevent it from locking out domain accounts?</p>
","<p>I checked the .net source code and found what causes an authentication problem in X509Certificate2.PublicKey. It is a creation of a new OID object:</p>

<pre><code>public PublicKey PublicKey {
    [SecuritySafeCritical]
    get {
        if (m_safeCertContext.IsInvalid)
            throw new CryptographicException(SR.GetString(SR.Cryptography_InvalidHandle), ""m_safeCertContext"");

        if (m_publicKey == null) {
            string friendlyName = this.GetKeyAlgorithm();
            byte[] parameters = this.GetKeyAlgorithmParameters();
            byte[] keyValue = this.GetPublicKey();
            Oid oid = new Oid(friendlyName, OidGroup.PublicKeyAlgorithm, true); // this line
            m_publicKey = new PublicKey(oid, new AsnEncodedData(oid, parameters), new AsnEncodedData(oid, keyValue));
        }

        return m_publicKey;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The OID constructor is called with lookupFriendlyName set to 'true', which leads to FindOidInfoWithFallback function:</p>

<pre><code>// Try to find OID info within a specific group, and if that doesn't work fall back to all
// groups for compatibility with previous frameworks
internal static string FindOidInfoWithFallback(uint key, string value, OidGroup group)
{
    string info = FindOidInfo(key, value, group);

    // If we couldn't find it in the requested group, then try again in all groups
    if (info == null &amp;&amp; group != OidGroup.All)
    {
        info = FindOidInfo(key, value, OidGroup.All);
    }

    return info;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The first FindOidInfo returns null and then it is called second time with OidGroup.All. Eventually it results in cryptAPI call:</p>

<pre><code>CAPIMethods.CryptFindOIDInfo(dwKeyType, pvKey, dwGroupId);
</code></pre>

<p>From <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa379938%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The CryptFindOIDInfo function performs a lookup in the active
  directory to retrieve the friendly names of OIDs under the following
  conditions:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>The key type in the dwKeyType parameter is set to    CRYPT_OID_INFO_OID_KEY or CRYPT_OID_INFO_NAME_KEY.</li>
  <li>No group identifier is specified in the dwGroupId parameter or the GroupID    refers to EKU OIDs, policy OIDs or template OIDs.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It then attempts to authentication with local user account and as a result I'm getting my domain account locked. From the comments to the code I see that the second FindOidInfo call was added for compatibility with older frameworks and potentially I can remove it. Unfortunately there is no easy was to change the code since it is in the framework itself. I may try to inherit the X509Certificate2 object and rewrite PublicKey and PrivateKey, but I don't really like that idea.</p>

","<p>What you need to understand is the Public Key Infrastructure. This structure consists of 2 keys per ""user"", one public, one private. PKI uses algorithms that can cipher a message using the public key of User1, and only knowing the private key of User1, can this message be deciphered. To use your example, Anyone can encrypt a message with Alice's Public Key, but only Alice can de-crypt it, because  Alice is the only one who has the private key counter-part. </p>

<p>PKI or asymmetric ciphers, are slower than symmetric cipher, that is why PKI is only used as a precursor of symmetric key ciphers.

<p>Yes, the message is encrypted with Bob's public key and encrypted with private key. ( Be aware that the size of the message is límited by RSA key size, so for encryption of large message RSA encryption is used to share a symmetric encryption key)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Likewise, in order for Alice to send a message that everyone can verify that it is from her, do we simply send an encrypted message with Alice's public key?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not correct. This case if known as 'digital signature'. The message is digested with a hashing algorithm like SHA, and the result is encrypted with Alice's private key. This is the signature. Bob can verify the message and signature with Alice's public key (decrypt the signature and check that the hash of the message is the same that the encrypted one). If verification is succesful you know that It has been issued by Alice because she owns the private key</p>

<p>You basically told Git now to connect and authenticate via SSH but didn’t give it a single information on how that actually works. SSH uses a a private/public key combination which requires you to generate those first on your machine and upload the <em>public</em> one to GitHub then.</p>

<p>Amazon's public key is public. Everyone knows it. The one that was issued May 3, 2018 begins ""A9 F4 4A 9B 29 84 20 A7 53 FF BA 01 B5 1E 0C 2A A7 53"". The whole point of public/private key cryptography is that the public key is not a secret. So capturing the public key is not important.</p>

<p>Your question isn't about masquerading as Amazon to you (i.e. having to do with Amazon's keys). It's about masquerading as you to Amazon. That's a completely different situation. You don't identify yourself to Amazon with a certificate (called a ""client certificate""), so certificates and public/private key cryptography have nothing to do with this. Yes; anyone could send a message to Amazon encrypted with their public key, but that's not how you prove you are who you say you are.</p>

<p>Instead, you identify yourself to Amazon with credentials, typically a user name and a password. When you do that, Amazon hands you back a session token, which is just a big random number that is mapped to you in a database table (or sometimes the session token is encrypted information about the session so that the database isn't needed). Once you're authenticated, you keep passing your session token back to Amazon to say ""you already know and trust who I am.""</p>

<p>So what if someone captures the session token? That would be a big deal. That would absolutely allow exactly what you're describing. The session token has to be protected for as long as it's valid. We protect it when we pass it to Amazon using TLS which ""prevents sniffers from knowing the content of a message"" so attackers hopefully can't discover the session id.</p>

<p>There are many attacks to steal the session id, broadly called ""session hijacking."" One of the more famous was <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firesheep"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Firesheep</a>, which relied on unsecured (HTTP) sessions. However, there are more advanced attacks against HTTPS, such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CRIME</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BREACH"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BREACH</a>. Improvements in TLS have mitigated against various known attacks, but it is always possible that new ones will emerge.</p>

<p>Very good question.  TLS prevents this by creating sessions keys between the client and server during the handshake protocol.  There are two types of keys: one for encryption (typically AES) and one for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">message integrity / message authentication</a> (MAC) (typically HMAC).  All comms during the session are encrypted with the symmetric encryption key and MAC'ed with the MAC key.  Any data that is not properly signed with the MAC key is not accepted by the server.  Thus, only one who has these keys can communicate with the server for that session.</p>

<p>So the question then reduces to how an attacker can determine the encryption and MAC keys which are set up during the initial TLS handshake.  Note during the handshake, the server provides its public key via the certificate to the client, and the client verifies that the certificate is valid -- including that it belongs to the domain that is claimed in the certificate.  This allows the client to verify that it is talking to the right server assuming nobody can bypass PKI (i.e. cert authorities are doing the right thing and nobody can break the public key crypto).  Now different clients can set up different sessions with the server, but they all are done using a private key generated by each client and uniquely known by each client.  Therefore, each client sets up its session in a unique way using a key that is known only to them and nobody else.</p>

<p>There is more to the whole design if you want to dig deep, including how sequence numbers are used to prevent replay attacks.  But I hope you get the general idea.</p>

"52687069","How to save public key in SSL certificate messages using OpenSsl?","<p>I want to save the public key and its algorithm in SSL Certificates messages.</p>

<p>in OpenSSL library, I found a function named public_key_type which returns public key algorithm. but to extract public key, I found just a function named evp_PKEY_print_public, which prints public key. but I don't want to print it. my goal is to save it in a structure.
anyone can help me?</p>
","<p>From your question, it is not entirely clear to me what you mean by ""to save it in a structure"". But I can explain how you can get access to the actual public key stored in your certificate, so you can do what you want with it.</p>

<p>First, you can use the following to get a hold of the certificate's public key, in its generic format:</p>

<pre><code>EVP_PKEY *pubkey = X509_get_pubkey(cert);
/* If it is not NULL, do what needs to be done with pubkey */
EVP_PKEY_free(pubkey);
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/crypto/X509_REQ_set_pubkey.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the documentation of <code>X509_get_pubkey()</code></a> for more information.</p>

<p>Now that you have this generic public key, you can use <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/crypto/EVP_PKEY_type.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">its lower-level key accessors</a> to get access to the underlying public key in its specific format. For example:</p>

<pre><code>RSA *rsapubkey = EVP_PKEY_get1_RSA(pubkey);
if (NULL != rsapubkey) {
    printf(""This cert has an RSA public key\n"");
    /* Do your stuff with the RSA key, for example using RSA_get0_key()
       for current versions of OpenSSL, or directly access the fields
       rsapubkey-&gt;n and rsapubkey-&gt;e for older versions */
    RSA_free(rsapubkey);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The function <code>EVP_PKEY_get1_RSA()</code> returns <code>NULL</code> if the underlying key is not an RSA key. Otherwise, you can use it to get access to the modulus (<code>n</code>) and exponent (<code>e</code>), which is basically all you need to ""save"" it. Or you can hold on to <code>rsapubkey</code>, since it contains all public key information. You have to <code>RSA_free()</code> it when you are done.</p>

<p>Similarly, you can use <code>EVP_PKEY_get1_EC_KEY()</code> if you expect an EC key.</p>

<p>In the <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/support/certificates/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">description</a> it sounds like it is a <code>public key</code> but if it is, than why do I need Certificate Signing Request (CSR) when creating it? </p>

<p>Everywhere I can find ""what is a developer certificate for"" and so on, but there is no information what the certificate — as an entity — is.  </p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is <code>.cer</code> file? (Not <code>.p12</code>)   </li>
<li>What is the difference between certificate and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">public key</a>?</li>
</ol>
","<p>A certificate certify who you are, its a kind of identity card or passport or whatever. A public key is something used to secure something, somehow like a real key closes a safety box not to let everyone have look inside.</p>

<p>Then you may have the need to certify that a public key is the one it claims. A certificate is (normally) obtained from another trusted authority (like your passport is delivered by a legal entity). If not how would you trust a public key I'll give to you? It can be a hacked public key, but if you have a certificate that belongs to it, then (if you trust the authority) you'll know it's really mine and not a forged one.</p>

<p>You may read <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Public Key Certificate</a> on Wikipedia for example.</p>

<p>The messages contain the respective public keys of the clients.</p>

<p>The server has a list of public keys.</p>

<p>If the newly received public key is not present in the list, the server adds it there.</p>

<p>I have done the part of comparing the public keys and writing the public key not present in the list.</p>

<p>Code for multithreaded server (here the server actually listens at two different ports) :</p>

<pre><code>while(!isStopped()){
        System.out.println(""Server is working"");
        try {
                serverSocket = ServerSocketChannel.open();
                serverSocket.configureBlocking(false);
                serverSocket.bind(new InetSocketAddress(serverPortRequest));

                    selector.select();
                    Set&lt;SelectionKey&gt; readyKeys = selector.selectedKeys();
                    Iterator&lt;SelectionKey&gt; iterator = readyKeys.iterator();
                    while(iterator.hasNext()){

                            SocketChannel client = serverSocket.accept();
                            (new Thread(new WorkerRunnable(client,""Multithreaded Server""))).start();
                        }
                    }
                }

        } catch (IOException e) {

<p>The WorkerRunnable thread is where I check if the client's public key is already in the server's list or not :</p>

        try {
            pk = new FileOutputStream(""contactsPK/contact""+Server.pkCounter++);

        }

    }
</code></pre>

<p>Here <code>userPK</code> is a <code>byte</code> array which stores the public key obtained from the message sent by a client.</p>

<p>How do i check at regular intervals (say 30 seconds) that a client, from the list of clients, has not sent the server a message? I would like to delete that client i.e. its public key from the list of stored public keys of the server.</p>
","<p>That's a really great question!</p>

<p>You're almost there with what you're trying to achieve, you just want to be careful about a couple of gotchas!</p>

<p>You start off your code with:</p>

<pre><code> while(!isStopped()){
 ...
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Which is a way of ensuring that you're consistently listening in on a port, but what you're also doing is creating a mutex lock for that process. You can read up on it here: </p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion</a></p>

<p>What that will do is ensure that no other processes have access to the processor while you're running this code. With that,  unfortunately you'll see that as you start to scale your code up and add on functionality, this loop will prevent you from decoupling your code, ensuring robustness, and adding functionality (I'll get back to this later!). First what you'll want to do is use a web framework for your application, this can be done using a plethora of different options. Here are two resources which can help you decide:</p>

<p><a href=""http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/the-curious-coders-java-web-frameworks-comparison-spring-mvc-grails-vaadin-gwt-wicket-play-struts-and-jsf/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/the-curious-coders-java-web-frameworks-comparison-spring-mvc-grails-vaadin-gwt-wicket-play-struts-and-jsf/</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_frameworks#Java"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_frameworks#Java</a></p>

<p>I would reccommend starting off with the Spring MVC framework, it's the most generic and widely used these days and you'll have ample resources online to help you get started.</p>

<p>Once you've picked your framework, you're going to want to create an MVC architecture web application, here are a couple of resources:</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller</a>
<a href=""http://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/</a></p>

<p>Your View isn't going to consist of too much, and in fact it can act as to just pass the public key along to your back-end (your controller and your model).</p>

<p>With the above mentioned, you can get rid of all the code that is looping and waiting to hear a ping from your ports, you can simply specify which ports to listen to in your Spring MVC configuration files. </p>

<p>Now for the fun part! You asked: </p>

<pre><code> ""How do i check at regular intervals (say 30 seconds) that a client, from the list of clients, has not sent the server a message? I would like to delete that client i.e. its public key from the list of stored public keys of the server.""
</code></pre>

<p>This can be achieved via two stores in your back end: redis - a session based key store, and a simple relation database of your flavor.</p>

<p>Your Algorithm can go simply as follows:</p>

<pre><code> 1. Every time your view forwards the information of a request to your backend, add it to your redis database, in the form &lt;id, key&gt;

 2. Simply create a thread to run every 30 seconds to do:
     2a. get the list of id's from redis
     2b. perform a left outer join on table a and b, where A is your sql table of ids, and B is the list of ids from redis.  A left outer join returns all the values from an inner join plus all values in the left table that do not match to the right table. Here is a resource for SQL Joins: http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/
     2c. The result of the join is your final answer, be sure to store this in your db.
     2d. purge all keys from redis (this is a one-liner)
</code></pre>

<p>You can create a thread to run every 30 seconds on your backend using ScheduledExecutorService as follows:</p>

<pre><code> ScheduledExecutorService exec = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();
 exec.scheduleAtFixedRate(new Runnable() {
 @Override
 public void run() {
     // 2a from above: (get the list of id's from redis)
     // 2b from above (perform a left outer join on table a and b, where A is your sql table of ids, and B is the list of ids from redis.  A left outer join returns all the values from an inner join plus all values in the left table that do not match to the right table.)
     // 2c from above (The result of the join is your final answer, be sure to store this in your db)
     // 2d from above (purge all keys from redis (this is a one-liner)
}
}, 0, 30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
</code></pre>

<p>Since this is a very concrete and repeatable task, you do have a couple of other options which have tradeoffs associated with them. You could create a crontab job which can execute a script which does the above, or even use triggers which are built into many relational databases's capabilities. The main down side to both is that you would be loosing code visibility as you choose to do so.</p>

<p>I also mentioned above about de-coupiling. Coupling (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)</a> is a very important concept as you begin to write code which scales. You want to keep code as loosely coupled as possible (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling</a>) beacuse it's going to make debugging and make writing in a OOP fashion much easier for you.</p>

<p>Problem is, I have no control over how the content is actually stored on these servers. So I might transmit the content e.g. as a JSON object with all data being base64-encoded and the signature is created using a hash of this the base64-encoded content concatenated in a certain order:</p>

<p>Hence the question: How to deal with signatures in this kinda scenario?</p>
","<p>It is still required to have a specific message representation in bits or bytes to be able to sign it. There are two ways to do this:</p>

<ol>
<li>just store the byte representation of the message and don't alter it afterwards (if the message is a string, first encode it with a well defined character encoding);</li>
<li>define a <em>canonical</em> representation of the message, you can either store the canonical representation the message directly or convert it in memory when you are updating the hash within your signature.</li>
</ol>

<p>A canonical representation of a message is a special, unique representation of the data that somehow distinguishes it from all other possible messages; this may for instance also include sorting the entries of a table (as long as the order doesn't change the meaning of the table), removing whitespace etc.</p>

<p>XML encryption for instance contains canonicalization methods for XML encoding. Obviously it is not possible to define canonicalization for data that has no intrinsic structure. Another (even) more complicated canonical representation is DER for ASN.1 messages (e.g. X509 certificates themselves as well as <em>within</em> RSA signatures). </p>

<p>Hence the question: How to deal with signatures in this kinda scenario?</p>
","<p>I think you're really asking two different questions:</p>

<p><strong>How should data be signed?</strong></p>

<p>I suggest using standard digital signature data format when possible, and ""detached signatures"" at other times. What this means in practice: PDF, Word, Excel and other file formats that provide for digital signatures should remain in those formats. </p>

<p>File formats that don't provide for digital signatures should be signed using a detached signature. The recommended standard for detached signatures is the .p7b file type–A PKCS#7 digital signature structure without the data. <a href=""http://developer.arx.com/examples/sapi_local_detached_signatures/"" rel=""nofollow"">Here is an example of signing data with a detached signature from my company.</a></p>

<p>This means that the ""Relying Party"" -- the person downloading/receiving the information -- would download two files. The first is the original data file, unchanged. The second file will be the detached signature for the first.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong> The signed file formats that directly support digital signatures can have their signatures verified using the file's usual software app. Ie, the free Adobe PDF Reader app knows how to verify digitally signed PDFs. In the same way, MS Word know how to verify signed Word files.</p>

<p>And for the other file types, the associated detached signature file will guarantee to the recipient that the file was not modified since it was signed and who the signer was (depending on the trust issue, see below).</p>

<p>Re database storage -- you don't care how the data is stored on the different servers (database, file system, etc.) In any or all cases, the data should remain unchanged.</p>

<p><strong>How to establish trust between the signer and the recipient</strong>
I suggest that the organization create its own root certificate. You can then put the certificate as a file on your SSL web site. (Your web site's SSL certificate should be from a CA, eg Comodo, VeriSign, etc.) The result is that people who trust your web site's SSL certificate can then trust your organizational certificate. And your signers' certificates should be chained to your organization's certificate, thus establishing trust for the recipients.</p>

<p>This method of creating a self-signed organizational certificate is low cost and provides a high level of trust. But relying parties will need to download and install your organization's certificate.</p>

<p>If that is not good, you can get certificates for your signers from a public Certificate Authority (CA), but that will drive up the cost by at least an order of magnitude due to the charges from the CA. My company, <a href=""http://www.arx.com"" rel=""nofollow"">CoSign</a>, supports all of these configurations.</p>

","<p>James K Polk pointed me into the right direction.
I had to Normalize the point first (""pub_key_1 =pub_key_1.Normalize()"") before I could obtain the coordinates.
I changed the code accordingly and now it gives me the correct results.</p>

","<p>With Java, you may use the well-known Bouncy Castle crypto library this way, to parse a PGP public key.</p>

<p>In your question, FilePath is the path to a file containing the PEM encoded public key, so here is a way to get the public exponent and modulus values:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a key ring object parsing the content of FilePath;</li>
<li>extract the public key from the key ring;</li>
<li>convert the generic public key object to an instance of <strong>RSAPublicBCPGKey</strong>, to access the <strong>getPublicExponent()</strong> and <strong>getModulus()</strong> methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the code snippet.</p>

<pre><code>package net.fenyo.tstpgp;

import java.io.*;
import org.bouncycastle.bcpg.*;
import org.bouncycastle.openpgp.*;
import org.bouncycastle.openpgp.jcajce.*;

public class App {
    static String FilePath = ""d:/temp/publickey.pem"";

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, PGPException {
        // Import the PEM encoded key in a key ring
        JcaPGPPublicKeyRingCollection pgpPub = new JcaPGPPublicKeyRingCollection(org.bouncycastle.openpgp.PGPUtil
                .getDecoderStream(new FileInputStream(new File(FilePath))));
        // Extract the public key from the ring
        PGPPublicKey pk = pgpPub.getKeyRings().next().getPublicKey();
        RSAPublicBCPGKey rsa = (RSAPublicBCPGKey) pk.getPublicKeyPacket().getKey();

        // Display the components of the public key
        System.out.println(""public exponent: "" + rsa.getPublicExponent().toString());
        System.out.println(""modulus: "" + rsa.getModulus().toString());
    }
}

<p>openssl pkey -in public.pem -pubin -pubout -outform DER | openssl dgst -sha256 -c</p>

<p>None of above gives me proper result. How do i now its not good. Bank sends me modulus and exponent of theirs public keys and corresponding hash values.
I've also tried with keys placed in ebics documentation but also without any success.</p>

<p>I try to recover the public key from cookie, here is what i've done, not sure if thats correct...</p>

<p>1) Register and login to get the cookie:</p>

<p>4) Decode the part of cookie after ""--"" as a ECDSA (DER) lets say its 'sig'.</p>

<pre><code>    ECDSA::Format::SignatureDerString.decode(sig)

"58520237","OpenSSL server public key from buffer to EVP_PKEY","<p>I'm programming a client that partecipates in a TLS 1.2 handshake by sending messages through a TCP socket connected to Google's server. I'm using the ECDH key exchange method.</p>

<p>I am trying to derive the shared secret using <a href=""https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Elliptic_Curve_Diffie_Hellman#Using_ECDH_in_OpenSSL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> code.</p>

<p>I received the key through the serverKeyExchange message and stored it in a buffer, so <strong>my question is: how do I generate a EVP_PKEY from a buffer?</strong>
I found a possible solution in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2918923/evp-pkey-from-char-buffer-in-x509-pkcs7"">this</a> post and tried with:</p>

<pre><code>i2d_PublicKey(peerkey, (unsigned char **) &amp;server_pub_key)
</code></pre>

<p>but when I run the code I get an error in this step:</p>

<pre><code>/* Provide the peer public key */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_derive_set_peer(ctx, peerkey)) handleErrors();
</code></pre>

<p>Which makes me think that I have not succeded at retrieving the server Public key.</p>

<p>Any Suggestions? How do I even know if the key was succesfully encoded?</p>
","<p>If you have the raw public key you must create an EC_Key with the correct parameters.</p>

<pre><code>EVP_PKEY * get_peerkey(const unsigned char * buffer, size_t buffer_len)
{
    EC_KEY *tempEcKey = NULL;
    EVP_PKEY *peerkey = NULL;

    // change this if another curve is required
    tempEcKey = EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name(NID_X9_62_prime256v1);
    if(tempEcKey == NULL) {
        handleErrors();
    }

    if(EC_KEY_oct2key(tempEcKey, buffer, buffer_len, NULL) != 1)  {
        handleErrors();
    }

    if(EC_KEY_check_key(tempEcKey) != 1) {
        handleErrors();
    }

    peerkey = EVP_PKEY_new();
    if(peerkey == NULL) {
        handleErrors();
    }

    if(EVP_PKEY_assign_EC_KEY(peerkey, tempEcKey)!= 1) {
        handleErrors();
    }

    return peerkey;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you have the public key as an ASN.1 sequence you can use the internal conversion methods:</p>

<pre><code>EVP_PKEY* get_peerkey(const unsigned char *buffer, size_t buffer_len)
{
    EVP_PKEY *peerkey = NULL;       
    const unsigned char *helper = buffer;

    // from ""openssl/x509.h""
    peerkey = d2i_PUBKEY(NULL, &amp;helper, buffer_len);
    if (!peerkey) {
        handleErrors();
        return NULL;

"28693811","Creating a globally unique user ID","<p>I am building a system in which each user has an account with a linked public key pair. The matching private key is used to sign messages. Data describing the accounts is stored in a p2p-system, so we need a lookup key for each account, which is globally unique (i.e. a globalID (GID).<br>
Question is: how do I choose these global IDs wisely? I mean in a manner that if there is an attack on the underlying p2p-system, an attacker would have a really hard time to exchange the keys.</p>

<p>I was thinking: Hashing the public key (with a salt), using this as the GID and signing the result would do the trick.<br>
This way, if an attacker exchanges the key the GID wouldn't match any more (even though the attacker would be able to create a new valid signature). The only way for the attack to succeed is to find a collision for the GID, which can then be used as the public key, while there's still the problem of finding the matching private key in order to create signatures.</p>

<pre><code>First approach: sha256(PubKey + Salt) = GID
Second approach: sha256(PubKey + Salt) + md5(PubKey + Salt) = GID
Third approach: PBKDF2(PubKey, sha256, Salt) = GID
</code></pre>

<p>Any thoughts on that?</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: Some more details:</p>

<p>In this system/architecture, users should be able to setup an account with a globally unique ID, which is linked to an endpoint of some sort associated with this user. Very similar to the DNS. But without domains.<br>
For signing purposes etc (not relevant here), each user has a public key pair. So the public key needs to be published in some way. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use case: Bob knows Alice's globalID and needs to ""get"" to her endpoint. She queries some system and receives a (signed) response comprising information about the endpoint as well as Alice's public key. With the public key, Bob verifies the signature. All done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now assume that there is no central authority and noone that runs a (semi-) central trustworthy system like the DNS that Bob can query. Solution could be a p2p/DHT system. So let's assume we use a Kademlia DHT to store and distribute this data records (globalID, public Key, endpoint data, signature). Problem is: everyone can easily overwrite any kind of data in those systems.</p>

<p>Scenario: Assume, an attacker Charlie could somehow overwrite such a record in an easy way by just creating his own new pub-key, setting the globalID to Alice's GID and signing this all with HIS private key. Now Bob would not be able to detect that Charlie is impersonating Alice by just knowing her globalID.</p>

<p>Therefore, the globalID should be directly linked to the public key, e.g. by using one of the approaches mentioned above. Therefore, when Charlie tries to attack again in the same way he would need to find a collision in the hash function and use it as his public key (then ""generating"" the matching private key to create the correct signature).</p>

<p>Question is now how to generate the GID from the public key or whether there is a major flaw in the system.</p>

<p>Hope this clarifies things a bit...</p>

<p>Is it possible to renew the server's SSL certificate without replacing the client's certificate? </p>

<p>We want to follow this guide: <a href=""https://www.smashingmagazine.com/how-to-issue-a-new-ssl-certificate-with-an-old-ssl-key/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.smashingmagazine.com/how-to-issue-a-new-ssl-certificate-with-an-old-ssl-key/</a></p>

<p>However, we are not sure if it helps. </p>

<p><strong>The question is:</strong></p>

<p>Does the <code>der</code> file (on the client side) contain only public key and it is safe to renew SSL certificate using the technique described in the link above (keeping same pub/private keys). </p>

<p>Will it work on client's device without replacing <code>der</code> file? Or <code>der</code> file contains not only the public key for SSL certificate but also some other information? </p>
","<p>I'm afraid, but based on your original post and clarifications, client will expect from web server <strong>the same</strong> server certificate as stored in DER file on client device. Client performs exact binary copy comparison (not only public keys).</p>

<p>Any attempts to replace server certificate will result in a connection failure on client. If you plan to replace the certificate on web server, you will have to update client devices as well.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are a lot of flawed HPKP implementations (to be honest, didn't see any reliable implementation) that work fine until server certificate is changed. In order to properly handle server certificate replacement, client <strong>MUST be able to store at least two server certificates</strong>, existing and new one. Here is the high-level server certificate replacement process:</p>

<ol>
<li>acquire new server certificate from CA in advance.</li>
<li>make application update by including new certificate side-by-side. When client updates the application on their device, client app will trust both, existing and new certificate.</li>
<li>give clients a time to make app update on their devices. Ideally, you should wait until all clients have updated app version with updated certificate.</li>
<li>change SSL certificate in server bindings.</li>
<li>after aa time you can make another update for client certificate by removing expired certificate from trust store.</li>
</ol>

<p>only this step sequence may guarantee uninterrupted certificate pinning renewal.</p>

<p>and, we know that GET is not a good choice, but I´ll need to use it. So, I think to use something like ""public keys"", what you think about this approach?</p>

<li>Application B validate this key and authorize or not the user.</li>
</ol>
","<p>In step 3, rather than thinking of a ""public key"", think of a ""session token"". Specifically, A redirects to B with</p>

<p>Tokens should be unique and short-living.</p>

<p>B then contacts A <strong>directly</strong> and asks about the identity behind the session token:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Can a PUBLIC key be created such that it can work for both encryption and decryption? (of the same object/code, of course)</p></li>
<li><p>Can a PUBLIC key be created for decryption only? (when encryption is done with the PRIVATE key). I mean, such that if used for encryption it CANNOT decrypt what it has encrypted?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>A Public key is exactly what it describes.  <strong>Public</strong>.  If you want a public key that both encrypts and decrypts, then it is no longer a public, nor asymmetric key.  It's just a standard symmetric key, for algorithms like AES etc.  Does this sound like what you want to do?</p>

<p>For your second question, a Public Key and Private Key are derived from a mathematical relationship. The RSA Private Key actually contains the Public Exponent and Modulus (among other components) that can be used to directly create the Public Key. Thus, if you have the Private Key, you also have the Public Key. Your second scenario is then not secure.</p>

<p>You might be interested in <strong>signing</strong> data using a Private Key and <strong>verifying</strong> the data using a Public Key.  This is common in SSL Certificates.</p>

<p>Here’s what works :</p>

<ul>

<li>encrypt_public in Elixir -> decrypt_pricate in Elixir (Works)</li>
</ul>

<p>But :</p>

<p>It seems that an encrypt_public from Node, can’t be decrypted by a decrypt_private in Elixir.
I even tried the hard way directly with the Erlang module public_key, it gives me the same result.</p>

<p>Here’s what I tried :</p>

<pre><code>var fs = require(""fs"")
var crypto = require(""crypto"")

var rsa_key = fs.readFileSync('./priv/public.key').toString()
var rsa_priv = fs.readFileSync('./priv/private.key').toString()
var buffer = Buffer.from(""Hello world"")

<p>the solution is to modify the padding in Node : </p>

<pre><code>var encrypted_auth = crypto.publicEncrypt({key: rsa_key, padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_PADDING}, buffer)
</code></pre>

<p>The second issue, was that EXPublicKey was trying to Base.url_decode64 while the Base64 generated by Node is not url safe

<p>Hmm, let's see.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Export the Public Key (.p7b or .cer) and the Private Key (.pfx) from the certificate.</p>

<p>Impossible. The private key isn't <em>in</em> the certificate. And there is no reason to export the public key. It's of no use without the certificate.</p>

  <p>Set a password for your Private Key (.pfx).</p>

<p>Good.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use your private key as your signing certificate.</p>

<p>This is completed and utter nonsense. A private key cannot be used as a certificate. It isn't a certificate. [It can however be used to <em>sign</em> things: if that's what they're talking about they should have said so, clearly.]</p>

<p>Yet more nonsense. Sending the public key accomplishes nothing, and a .cer file isn't a key file, it's a certificate file.</p>

<p>They are talking rank nonsense. If those are really the directions you were sent, tell them so, send them back, get your money back, and start all over again with somebody that actually knows what they're talking about. These instructions cannot possibly have been even tested.</p>

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>I want to encrypt some files in my server, after asking other people, i realized that the most recommended method is encrypt those files (larges) using a private key.</p>

<p>Now, i was looking for the <a href=""https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_privateencrypt_privatekey_buffer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">docs</a> and saw these methods</p>

<ul>
<li><code>crypto.publicEncrypt(pubKey, buffer)</code></li>
<li><code>crypto.publicDecrypt(pubKey, buffer)</code></li>
<li><code>crypto.privateEncrypt(privKey, buffer)</code></li>
<li><code>crypo.privateDecrypt(privKey, buffer)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>this is very confusing because i don't know what of them i must to use now, ahm... i don't know what is the most appropriate way to do this securely.</p>
","<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> encrypt with the public key. Keep your private key safe.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these methods are poorly named. <code>privateEncrypt</code> should be called something like <code>sign</code> and <code>publicDecrypt</code> should be called something like <code>verify</code>.</p>

<p>When using public-key encryption (also known as asymmetric encryption), one key can be used to write a cipher and the other key can undo that operation. Your public key is potentially known to everyone, and your private key is secret.</p>

<p>If you want to keep something secret, except from the owner of a certain key, you want to encrypt a message with <em>their</em> public key. So if Alice wants to receive encrypted messages, she'll share her public key <code>A_pub</code> and her secret key <code>A_priv</code>, she'll keep to herself.. You'll encrypt your message <code>crypto.publicEncrypt(A_pub, buffer)</code>. She'll then decrypt that message with <code>crypto.privateDecrypt(A_priv, buffer)</code>.</p>

<p>Doing it the other way is known as a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>digitial signature</strong></a>. </p>

<p>Current environment:</p>

<ul>
<li>40+ *nix systems managed by 6 admins</li>
<li>Highly secure, closed network (no internet access)</li>
<li>Regularly audited (all account passwords must be changed every 90 days)</li>
</ul>

<p>Current procedures:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each administrator has a personal account with sudo access. These admin accounts are managed via Active Directory so password changes are not an issue</li>
<li>Root account is also active for specific circumstances (i.e. admin account is locked out)</li>
<li>When it comes time to change the root passwords, an admin will do so by SSHing into each system (40+)</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to write a script to make the root password changing process more efficient and everything I've read indicates that the most secure way to go about it is by using public key authentication. So my question is: If I log in as root to SYSTEM_1 and set up the public/private key pairs between that system and SYSTEM_2, SYSTEM_3, etc, does that mean I will only be able to run the script from SYSTEM_1? Is this even a good idea security wise? Are there any other ways to script this that I am missing?</p>
","<p>You can use RSA Authentication and expect script</p>

<p>Let's say you are executing expect script on system 1, create public-private key pair and store public key on all the other systems you have to login (system 2.....n) </p>

<p>Now you wont need a password when you ssh into those system.</p>

<p>Now you can use expect script to change password for either root or any other user. 
NOTE : usually expect interpreter is at     /usr/bin/expect
you can find this my doing ""whereis expect""</p>

<p>I am creating an API to be used by clients via Javascript. The client should include on his website something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
    var my_api = { 
        public_key: ""123456""
    };
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>So... how can I use a Public Key to verify the client's website?</p>

<p>I know I can get the referer and compare it in with the key on my database, but:</p>

<p>(a) If the referer may be faked, a public key won't be useful because is already public </p>

<p>And (b) if the referer can't be faked, Why would I use a public key? Is not enougth with the referer? </p>

<p>I can't ask the client to encrypt something to varify if he have the right key if anybody can knows the key... </p>

<p>I have only created APIs with both private and public key (or only private) in the past.</p>

<p>Finally, I want it all be installed on client's website by copy/pasting few lines of JS code (that's why I want only use public key). </p>

<p>I know it is possible because that's how Google Ads works, I just need help to figure out the way.</p>

<p>Now I want to reuse asymetric encryption for the following use case: The recipient publishes data and everyone who knows the recipient's public key (which is basically everyone in the system, but nobody outside the system e.g. a protection against leaking readable data to the public) can read it.

","<p>RSA signing is not the same as encrypting with the private key.</p>

<p>PKCS#1 v1.5 signature:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hash the content with a chosen algorithm.</li>
<li>Create a DigestInfo value to represent the hash.</li>
<li>Apply padding to make a message almost, but not quite, the size of the modulus (details omitted here).</li>
<li>Apply the RSA primitive with the private key</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that last step doesn’t say “encrypt”.</p>

<p>The RSA classes in .NET do the padding and such for you, so they expose Sign/Verify and Encrypt/Decrypt. You can’t use them for cross purposes, and you can’t use these classes for the RSA primitive (aka “raw RSA”).</p>

<p>Although Bouncy is fine and has many features if you want to use it, core Java can handle X.509 certificates since forever. For a cert in a file (or anything that can be accessed as a Stream) in <em>either</em> PEM or DER format (although the javadoc isn't clear on that) all you need is <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/security/cert/CertificateFactory.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CertificateFactory</a>:</p>

<pre><code>CertificateFactory fact = CertificateFactory.getInstance(""X.509"");

// from a real file
InputStream is = new FileInputStream (""filename"");
Certificate cert = fact.generateCertificate(is);
is.close(); // or use try-resources to do automatically

// from an alternate/custom filesystem, such as a ZIP
Path p = Paths.get(""somespecification""); // or any other creation of a Path
InputStream is = Files.newInputStream(p); // add open options if needed
// same as before

// from the classpath (usually a JAR)
InputStream is = ClassLoader /*or any Class&lt;?&gt; object*/ .getResourceAsStream(""name"");
// same as before

// from a byte[] in memory
InputStream is = new ByteArrayInputStream (bytearray);
// same as before, except don't really need to close

// you get the idea
</code></pre>

<p>Although JCA APIs like this one are defined to allow a lot of extension,  reading an X.509 cert will actually give you not just <code>Certificate</code> but subclass <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/security/cert/X509Certificate.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>X509Certificate</code></a> from which <code>.getNotAfter()</code> gives the expiration date-time directly. The email address if present (which isn't required by X.509 certs in general, but should always be the case in a cert used for S/MIME) will usually be an attribute in the subject name, which actually has internal structure that Java doesn't let you get at directly so you need to:</p>

<pre><code>String x500name = ((X509Certificate)cert).getSubjectX500Principal()) .toString();
// simple case: no multivalue RDN, no reserved chars ,+=""&lt;&gt;\;# or extra spaces 
for( String attr : x500name.split("", "") )
  if( attr.startsWith(""EMAILADDRESS="") ) 
    ... use attr.substring(13) ...
// other cases require slightly more complicated parsing 
</code></pre>

<p>Note there is no encryption at all in X.509, and thus no actual decryption, although many people use 'decrypt' to describe anything unfamiliar not an actual cipher.</p>

<p>See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/8777257/850848"">equals vs Arrays.equals in Java</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Btw, technically you cannot create <em>a public key from a private key</em>. But as <code>KeyPair.writePrivateKey</code> actually writes <em>a whole key pair</em>, not the private key only, it naturally contains the public key too.</p>

<p>Here is how i generate the key pair and data signing using BouncyCastle library:</p>

<pre><code>public static string GetBase64Key(AsymmetricKeyParameter key)
{
    var publicKey = (RsaKeyParameters)key;

    using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream())
    {
        byte[] buff = publicKey.Exponent.ToByteArrayUnsigned();
        ms.Write(buff, 0, buff.Length);

        buff = publicKey.Modulus.ToByteArrayUnsigned();
        ms.Write(buff, 0, buff.Length);

        ms.Flush();
        return Convert.ToBase64String(ms.ToArray());
    }
}

public static AsymmetricCipherKeyPair LoadKeyPair(string file)
{
    using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(file))
    {
        PemReader pem = new PemReader(reader);
        return pem.ReadObject() as AsymmetricCipherKeyPair;
    }
}

public static void SaveKeyPair(AsymmetricCipherKeyPair pair, string file)
{
    using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(file))
    {
        PemWriter pem = new PemWriter(writer);
        pem.WriteObject(pair.Private);
        pem.WriteObject(pair.Public);
    }
}

public static AsymmetricCipherKeyPair GenerateKeyPair(int keySize)
{
    CryptoApiRandomGenerator randomGenerator = new CryptoApiRandomGenerator();
    SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom(randomGenerator);
    var keyGenerationParameters = new KeyGenerationParameters(secureRandom, keySize);
    var keyPairGenerator = new RsaKeyPairGenerator();
    keyPairGenerator.Init(keyGenerationParameters);
    return keyPairGenerator.GenerateKeyPair();
}

public static byte[] SignDataSHA1(byte[] data, AsymmetricKeyParameter privateKey)
{
    ISigner signer = SignerUtilities.GetSigner(""SHA1WITHRSA"");
    signer.Init(true, privateKey);
    signer.BlockUpdate(data, 0, data.Length);
    return signer.GenerateSignature();
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this is how i used those helper functions:</p>

<pre><code>// Initialiizing key pair.
AsymmetricCipherKeyPair pair;

if (File.Exists(RSA_CONTAINER_NAME))
{
    pair = CryptoHelper.LoadKeyPair(RSA_CONTAINER_NAME);
}
else
{
    pair = CryptoHelper.GenerateKeyPair(RSA_KEY_STRENGTH);
    CryptoHelper.SaveKeyPair(pair, RSA_CONTAINER_NAME);
}

// Signing token.
byte[] signedData = CryptoHelper.SignDataSHA1(token, pair.Private);

// Writing data.
Message msg = new Message();
msg.Command = Message.A_AUTH;
msg.Arg0 = 2; // Private key signing.
msg.Data = signedData;
msg.DataLength = signedData.Length;
await SendMessageAsync(device, msg);

// Reading response.
Message reply = await ReadMessageAsync(device);
byte[] replyBody = new byte[reply.DataLength];
await device.ReadAsync(replyBody, 0, replyBody.Length);

if (reply.Command == Message.A_AUTH)
{
    // Sending rsa public key.
    string pem = CryptoHelper.GetBase64Key(pair.Public) + ""\0"";
    byte[] publicKey = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(pem);
    msg = new Message();
    msg.Command = Message.A_AUTH;
    msg.Arg0 = 3; // RSAPUBLICKEY
    msg.Data = publicKey;
    msg.DataLength = publicKey.Length;
    await SendMessageAsync(device, msg);

    // Reading response.
    reply = await ReadMessageAsync(device);
    replyBody = new byte[reply.DataLength];
    await device.ReadAsync(replyBody, 0, replyBody.Length);
}

if (reply.Command != Message.A_CNXN)
{
    // Something went wrong.
    throw new Exception(""Authentication error"");
}

// Done.
</code></pre>

<p>Any help would be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Note: I have completed the steps until i got the token to sign from the device for brevity. I also have tried PEM format (without including the BEGIN and END lines), didn't work either.</p>
","<p>I finally managed to fix my authentication problem. I decided to include pre generated public and private key to my app (not generated automatically anymore). I also installed bouncy castle library for C# to parse private key provided by adb. Public key problem fixed.</p>

<p>Turned out that my signing method is also wrong. Here is the correct one (using bouncy castle):</p>

<pre><code>public static byte[] SignDataSHA1(byte[] data, AsymmetricKeyParameter privateKey)
{
    // Converting bouncy castle key to native csp.
    RSAParameters rsaParam = DotNetUtilities.ToRSAParameters(privateKey as RsaPrivateCrtKeyParameters);

    using (RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider())
    {
        rsa.ImportParameters(rsaParam);

        // Signing data.
        return rsa.SignHash(data, CryptoConfig.MapNameToOID(""SHA1""));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I basically just tell the signer that the data already hashed and voila, it worked.</p>

<p>I got the hash value, which matches to the downloaded md5 file by characters, but NOT by case. 
So <strong>question #1</strong>: Is PGP Hash verification case-insensitive?</p>

"53229641","How can I tell if given data is encrypted with a public key","<p>I'm going to re-phrase my question completely so it makes more general sense (and correct my blunder with AES/RSA).</p>

<p>Alice has a large block of data to send to Bob via a local mailbox that isn't secure.  To keep her data from prying eyes, she does this:</p>

<ul>
<li>She generates a random 256-bit key</li>
<li>She uses AES-256 encryption to encrypt the data using the key</li>
<li>She uses Bob's public key to encrypt the key she's used</li>
<li>She puts the encrypted data and the encrypted key in the mailbox addressed to Bob</li>
</ul>

<p>Mike the mailman picks up the mail from the mailbox.  However, he doesn't want to lug the data all the way across the internet to Bob's place if bob isn't going to be able to decrypt it.</p>

<p>The question is, how can Mike ascertain whether the key has actually been encrypted using Bob's public key?</p>

<p>In my application I need to transport sensitive data to a data centre.  To achieve this, I have an upload process that accepts files (that have already been AES-encrypted with a key, then the key is encrypted with the recipient's public key) and sends them to the data centre.  The corresponding private key is held at the data centre and used to decrypt the files on receipt.  This is currently in the design stage so there is some flexibility on the public/private key technology to be used but it's likely to be a C# application that's doing the work.</p>

<p>I would like to protect against uploading files that have NOT been encrypted using the public key (because I may waste significant bandwidth and the receiving application at the datacentre will fail to decrypt them).</p>

<p>So, what I want to know is how can I tell at the sending end whether a file has been encrypted using a given public key?</p>

<p>In a nutshell, I have an encrypted file and a public key.  Has the file been encrypted with that key?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance etc.!</p>

","<p>The uncompressed key is too long, you are right.
The compressed key is the uncompressed key as Base58 data.
Satoshi decided to use Base58 because Base58 has only characters which do not look similar (Like ""O"" and""0""). Also Base58 strings are much smaller and more readable. There are several libraries which help you to convert data to Base58 and vice versa.</p>

"57512518","git remote -v : url is shown as ssh but it should be https","<p>I've already read through a lot of posts that have the same title, but none of the answers on them solved my problem. <strong>So please read the whole question before answering or marking as repeated!</strong></p>

<p>Summary of the problem:</p>

<p>I'm trying to push to a remote repository on Github, but it is giving me this error:</p>

<p><strong>Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '192.30.253.112' to the list of known hosts.
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.*
Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.</strong></p>

<p>Background on what I did:</p>

<p>I added a remote repo as usual by getting the url shown on Github. The command I typed was:
<code>git remote add origin https://github.com/bowtie/myremote.git</code>
Then I checked my remote repos by typing <code>git remote -v</code> and, even though I added an https url, it shows urls with ""ssh"" in front of them:
 git remote -v
<code>origin  ssh://git@github.com/bowtie/myremote.git (fetch)</code>
<code>origin  ssh://git@github.com/bowtie/myremote.git (push)</code>
Then I tried to push anyway, at which point it gave me the error I mentioned:</p>

<p><code>git push --set-upstream origin master
Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '192.30.253.112'
to the list of known hosts.
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.</code></p>

<p>Why is it showing ssh even though I added the url as https? I tried changing it using git remote set-url, nothing changed. I removed the url completely then readded it and it still added the ""ssh"" to it. I checked the git config file, and the url is written correctly with https inside it, then why is it showing ssh on the command line? </p>

<p>By the way, I had another remote and when I encountered this problem, I deleted the .git file from the local repo and reinitialised it, then created another remote, thinking maybe the problem was in the remote. But still the problem persisted. I had tried to change from https to ssh before, but I couldn't get the key. Right now, I just want git bash to show me the correct url without the ssh:// and to push my commits. Thoughts?</p>
","<p>I figured out where the problem was. I had previously made a command to replace every https with ssh using insteadOf, which applies to all git operations. I fixed it by fixing the git config --global file.</p>

<p>The command I used was something like this :
<code>git config --global url.""git@github.com:"".insteadOf ""https://github.com/""</code></p>

<p>The solution is to edit the config global file by using:
<code>git config --global --edit</code> and delete the line manually</p>

<p>I found the problem explained here: <a href=""https://discuss.bitrise.io/t/git-force-to-use-ssh-url-instead-of-https-for-github-com/4384"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://discuss.bitrise.io/t/git-force-to-use-ssh-url-instead-of-https-for-github-com/4384</a></p>

"56493202","Could SSL pinning be applied to a portion of an application's code?","<p>I know (please correct me if I'm wrong) that SSL-pinning consists of hard-coding the public key of the server in the application, so during the handshake protocol, when the client receives a <code>hello server</code> message, it will compare the server's public key to the one on the application's code, if they don't match the client will end the authentication.</p>

<p>I am trying to understand how certificate pinning works? Here is what I do:</p>

<p>I am proxing the traffic coming from an Android application to my server. The application is constantly making requests to the server so it can update it's content, but those requests are issued automatically by the application, and mimtproxy does intercept them.</p>

<p><strong>Now when I send a request from the application, mitmproxy does not intercept it. It only intercepts the ones issued automatically by the application</strong></p>

<p>Things I tried to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>I've rooted my android device, and mimtproxy still can't intercept the traffic.</li>
<li>I've installed mitmproxy certificate on the root store on my android device.</li>
</ol>

<p>The topology I'm using:</p>

<p><code>Client (Android 6.0.1) --&gt; proxy (mitmproxy running on linux) --&gt; server</code></p>

<p>According to some research I made about certificate pinning, the client ends the conversation as soon as the public key it receives is not the one it trusts. However, in my case, the proxy keeps receiving the requests that the application is sending automatically which brings me to my question: Can certificate pinning be applied to portions of an application's code? for example, when the client sends a specific request we check the public key it's received and we neglect this for other requests?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<pre><code>$ErrorActionPreference = ""Stop""
$cfg = new-object -com ""BssCfg815.BssCfg815""
$result = $cfg.settings.Load()
if ($result.failure) { Write-Error $result.Describe() }
foreach ($account in $cfg.settings.access.virtAccounts.entries)
{
    Write-Host ""Virtual account $($account.virtAccount) ""
    $filename = $account.virtAccount
    $cfg.keypairs.Load()
    $keys = $cfg.PublicKey.GetItem(0).ExportPublicKeyToBase64String($cfg.enums.PublicKeyFormat.ssh2)
    write-Host $keys
}
</code></pre>
