"20770072","AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding vs AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding with 256 key size performance java","<p>I am currently using <code>AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding</code> for encrypting files in Java with <strong>256 bytes</strong> key size, but while searching I found on stackexchange <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/9043/what-is-the-difference-between-pkcs5-padding-and-pkcs7-padding"">PKCS#5-PKCS#7 Padding</a> and  it is mentioned,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PKCS#5 padding is a subset of PKCS#7 padding for 8 byte block sizes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I want to know  </p>

<ol>
<li>Will the performance of <code>AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding</code> will be better then <code>AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding</code> for the above configuration?</li>
<li>How can we configure the block size in Java as it is mentioned

<blockquote>
  <p>PKCS#7 padding would work for any block size from 1 to 255 bytes.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>My sample code is,</p>

<pre><code>SecureRandom rnd = new SecureRandom();
IvParameterSpec iv = new IvParameterSpec(rnd.generateSeed(16));

KeyGenerator generator = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""AES"");
generator.init(256);
SecretKey k = generator.generateKey();

Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");
c.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, k, iv);
</code></pre>
","<p>The block size is a property of the used cipher algorithm. For AES it is always 16 bytes.</p>

<p>So strictly speaking, PKCS5Padding cannot be used with AES since it is defined only for a block size of 8 bytes. I assume, AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding is interpreted as AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding internally.</p>

<p>The only difference between these padding schemes is that PKCS7Padding has the block size as a parameter, while for PKCS5Padding it is fixed at 8 bytes. When the Block size is 8 bytes they do exactly the same.</p>

"7314901","How to add/remove PKCS7 padding from an AES encrypted string?","<p>I'm trying to encrypt/decrypt a string using 128 bit AES encryption (ECB). What I want to know is how I can add/remove the PKCS7 padding to it. It seems that the Mcrypt extension can take care of the encryption/decryption, but the padding has to be added/removed manually.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>
","<p>Let's see. PKCS #7 is described in RFC 5652 (Cryptographic Message Syntax).</p>

<p>The padding scheme itself is given in section <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652#section-6.3"" rel=""noreferrer"">6.3.  Content-encryption Process</a>. It essentially says: append that many bytes as needed to fill the given block size (but at least one), and each of them should have the padding length as value.</p>

<p>Thus, looking at the last decrypted byte we know how many bytes to strip off. (One could also check that they all have the same value.)</p>

<p>I could now give you a pair of PHP functions to do this, but my PHP is a bit rusty. So either do this yourself (then feel free to edit my answer to add it in), or have a look at the <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.mcrypt-encrypt.php#usernotes"" rel=""noreferrer"">user-contributed notes</a> to the mcrypt documentation - quite some of them are about padding and provide an implementation of PKCS #7 padding.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, let's look on the <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mcrypt-encrypt.php#105173"" rel=""noreferrer"">first note there</a> in detail:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

function encrypt($str, $key)
 {
     $block = mcrypt_get_block_size('des', 'ecb');
</code></pre>

<p>This gets the block size of the used algorithm. In your case, you would use <code>aes</code> or <code>rijndael_128</code> instead of <code>des</code>, I suppose (I didn't test it). (Instead, you could simply take <code>16</code> here for AES, instead of invoking the function.)</p>

<pre><code>     $pad = $block - (strlen($str) % $block);
</code></pre>

<p>This calculates the padding size. <a href=""http://de3.php.net/manual/en/function.strlen.php"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>strlen($str)</code></a> is the length of your data (in bytes), <code>% $block</code> gives the remainder modulo <code>$block</code>, i.e. the number of data bytes in the last block. <code>$block - ...</code> thus gives the number of bytes needed to fill this last block (this is now a number between <code>1</code> and <code>$block</code>, inclusive).</p>

<pre><code>     $str .= str_repeat(chr($pad), $pad);
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://de3.php.net/manual/en/function.str-repeat.php"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>str_repeat</code></a> produces a string consisting of a repetition of the same string, here a repetition of the <a href=""http://de3.php.net/manual/en/function.chr.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">character given by</a> <code>$pad</code>, <code>$pad</code> times, i.e. a string of length <code>$pad</code>, filled with <code>$pad</code>.
<code>$str .= ...</code> appends this padding string to the original data.</p>

<pre><code>     return mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_DES, $key, $str, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB);
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the encryption itself. Use <a href=""http://de3.php.net/manual/en/mcrypt.ciphers.php"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128</code></a> instead of <code>MCRYPT_DES</code>.</p>

<pre><code> }
</code></pre>

<p>Now the other direction:</p>

<pre><code> function decrypt($str, $key)
 {   
     $str = mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_DES, $key, $str, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB);
</code></pre>

<p>The decryption. (You would of course change the algorithm, as above). $str is now the decrypted string, including the padding.</p>

<pre><code>     $block = mcrypt_get_block_size('des', 'ecb');
</code></pre>

<p>This is again the block size. (See above.)</p>

<pre><code>     $pad = ord($str[($len = strlen($str)) - 1]);
</code></pre>

<p>This looks a bit strange. Better write it in multiple steps:</p>

<pre><code>    $len = strlen($str);
    $pad = ord($str[$len-1]);
</code></pre>

<p><code>$len</code> is now the length of the padded string, and <code>$str[$len - 1]</code> is the last character of this string. <a href=""http://de3.php.net/manual/en/function.ord.php"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ord</code></a> converts this to a number. Thus <code>$pad</code> is the number which we previously used as the fill value for the padding, and this is the padding length.</p>

<pre><code>     return substr($str, 0, strlen($str) - $pad);
</code></pre>

<p>So now we cut off the last <code>$pad</code> bytes from the string. (Instead of <code>strlen($str)</code> we could also write <code>$len</code> here: <code>substr($str, 0, $len - $pad)</code>.).</p>

<pre><code> }

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that instead of using <code>substr($str, $len - $pad)</code>, one can also write <code>substr($str, -$pad)</code>, as the <code>substr</code> function in PHP has a special-handling for negative operands/arguments, to count from the end of the string. (I don't know if this is more or less efficient than getting the length first and and calculating the index manually.)</p>

<p>As said before and noted in the comment by rossum, instead of simply stripping off the padding like done here, you should check that it is correct - i.e. look at <code>substr($str, $len - $pad)</code>, and check that all its bytes are <code>chr($pad)</code>. This serves as a slight check against corruption (although this check is more effective if you use a chaining mode instead of ECB, and is not a replacement for a real MAC).</p>

<hr>

<p>(And still, tell your client they should think about changing to a more secure mode than ECB.)</p>

<p>1 - Convert all certificates in DER format </p>

<pre><code>openssl x509 -in certificate.pem -outform DER -out certificate.crt
</code></pre>

<p>2 - Concat all DER certificates into one single file</p>

<pre><code>cat cert1.crt cert2.crt ... &gt; chain.der
</code></pre>

<p>3 - Now you can import the chain into your keystore with keytool </p>

<pre><code>keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -alias &lt;myalias&gt; -file chain.der -keystore keystore.jks -storepass &lt;mypassword&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>myalias</code> <strong>MUST be the same</strong> as the one used when the key was generated.</p>

<p>4 - verify that the chain was successfully imported</p>

<pre><code>keytool -list -v -keystore keystore.jks

"12426064","How to sign pdf in Java using pdfbox","<p>I am trying to sign pdf using pdfbox libraries.
I have stuck now and realy need a help.</p>

<p>This is my code:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>private static void signPdf(PDDocument document) throws Exception 
{
    PDSignature sig = new PDSignature();
    sig.setFilter(COSName.ADOBE_PPKLITE);
    sig.setSubFilter(COSName.ADBE_PKCS7_DETACHED);
    sig.setByteRange(new int[] {'a','a','a','a'});
    sig.setContents(new byte[]{(byte) 23, (byte) 23, (byte) 23, (byte) 23});

    SignatureOptions options = new SignatureOptions();

    document.addSignature(sig, new SignatureInterface() {
        public byte[] sign(InputStream content)
                throws SignatureException, IOException       {        
             //this should be made MD5 checksum?           
            return new byte[]{(byte) 'a', (byte) 'a', (byte) 'a', (byte) 'a'};
        }
    }, options);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then Iam saving my pdf, but:
1) I have noticed that sign method is never called
2) Where should I attach certyficate? in sign method?</p>

<p>pdf:</p>

<pre><code>/Type /Sig
/Filter /Adobe.PPKLite
/SubFilter /adbe.pkcs7.sha1
/Contents &lt;0000000000. a lot of zeros..000&gt;
/ByteRange [0 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000]
</code></pre>

<p>I think that i miss something, but documentation says nothing about how to sign a file.</p>

<p>Tahnks in advance JC.</p>

<p>Here is how I save my pdf:</p>

","<p>OpenSSL uses PKCS7 padding by default.  This padding means when your data is not a multiple of the block size, you pad <em>n</em> bytes of the value <em>n</em>, where <em>n</em> is however many bytes you need to get to the block size.  AES's block size is 16.</p>

"6099467","How to parse a SAML assertion request in .Net","<p>I'm trying to implement a SAML SSO solution in .Net, but I'm having a problem parsing the assertion.</p>

<p>I have a sample assertion (looks like <code>byte[]</code> data as text) and corresponding <code>.p7b</code> file.</p>

<p>I want to load the keys from the <code>.p7b</code> and decrypt the assertion to an XML document.</p>

<p>So far I think I'm reading the keys correctly:</p>

<pre><code>// get the key data
byte[] certificateData = System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(""myKeys.p7b"");

// decode the keys
var cms = new SignedCms(SubjectIdentifierType.IssuerAndSerialNumber);
cms.Decode(certificateData);

var samlCertificates = cms.Certificates;
</code></pre>

<p>Then I try to parse the assertion I get a problem:</p>

<pre><code>// we have a keychain of X509Certificate2s, we need a collection of tokens
var certificatesAsTokens =
    from X509Certificate2 cert in samlCertificates
    select new X509SecurityToken(cert) as SecurityToken;

// get a token resolver
var tokens = new ReadOnlyCollection&lt;SecurityToken&gt;(
    certificatesAsTokens.ToList());
var resolver = SecurityTokenResolver.CreateDefaultSecurityTokenResolver(
    tokens, true);

// get the SAML data in an XML reader
var reader = XmlReader.Create(assertionPostStream);

// use the WS Security stuff to parse the reader
var securityToken = WSSecurityTokenSerializer.
    DefaultInstance.ReadToken(reader, resolver) as SamlSecurityToken;
</code></pre>

<p>That last statement throws an exception, stating that it can't parse the XML content.</p>

<p>I think this means that I'm missing a step decrypting the assertion - getting the <code>byte[]</code> as text converted to a SAML format XML document.</p>

<p>Anyone know how to add this step? Am I missing something else?</p>
","<p>I've figured this out - I was missing part of the SAML specification.</p>

<p>The assertion is sent (rather weirdly, since it isn't encrypted) as base64 data, and it was being URL encoded twice as it was sent.</p>

<p>So adding this step gives us a valid assertion:</p>

<pre><code>// spec says ""SAMLResponse="" 
string rawSamlData = Request[""SAMLResponse""];

// the sample data sent us may be already encoded, 
// which results in double encoding
if (rawSamlData.Contains('%'))
{
    rawSamlData = HttpUtility.UrlDecode(rawSamlData);
}

// read the base64 encoded bytes
byte[] samlData = Convert.FromBase64String(rawSamlData);

// read back into a UTF string
string samlAssertion = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(samlData);
</code></pre>

    InputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream(certObj.getDEREncoded());
    certList.add(cf.generateCertificate(in));

CertPath certPath = cf.generateCertPath(certList);

// Load key store
//String keyStorePath = ...
KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS"");
keyStore.load(new FileInputStream(keyStorePath), null);

// Set validation parameters
PKIXParameters params = new PKIXParameters(keyStore);
params.setRevocationEnabled(false); // to avoid exception on empty CRL

// Validate certificate path

"6126388","How to verify an X509Certificate2 against an X509Certificate2Collection chain","<p>I'm writing a SAML 2.0 response parser to handle POST authentication in ASP.Net (in C# and MVC, but that's less relevant).</p>

<p>So I have a <code>.p7b</code> file to validate with and that can be read into a <code>X509Certificate2Collection</code> and a sample assertion - a base 64 encoded SAML response.</p>

<p>Ideally I want to use the built in <code>WSSecurityTokenSerializer</code>, but <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6108564"">that fails</a>, so I'm looking for a way that works.</p>

<p>I'm reading the XML directly instead:</p>

<pre><code>// get the base 64 encoded SAML
string samlAssertionRaw = GetFromHttpRequest();

// load a new XML document
var assertion = new XmlDocument { PreserveWhitespace = true };
assertion.LoadXml(samlAssertionRaw);

// use a namespace manager to avoid the worst of xpaths
var ns = new XmlNamespaceManager(assertion.NameTable);
ns.AddNamespace(""samlp"", @""urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol"");
ns.AddNamespace(""saml"", @""urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion"");
ns.AddNamespace(""ds"", SignedXml.XmlDsigNamespaceUrl);

// get the signature XML node
var signNode = assertion.SelectSingleNode(
    ""/samlp:Response/saml:Assertion/ds:Signature"", ns);

// load the XML signature
var signedXml = new SignedXml(assertion.DocumentElement);
signedXml.LoadXml(signNode as XmlElement);

// get the certificate, basically:
// signedXml.KeyInfo.OfType&lt;KeyInfoX509Data&gt;().First().
//     Certificates.OfType&lt;X509Certificate2&gt;().First()
// but with added checks
var certificate = GetFirstX509Certificate(signedXml);

// check the key and signature match
if (!signedXml.CheckSignature(certificate, true))
{
    throw new SecurityException(""Signature check failed."");
}

// go on and read the SAML attributes from the XML doc
</code></pre>

<p>That lot works, but all it's doing is checking that the signature and the <code>X509Certificate2</code> public key in the SAML response match. It doesn't in any way verify who it's from, and I need to do that before accepting the SAML authentication.</p>

<p>There appear to be two ways to check the certificate found in the SAML response - I can do <code>certificate.Verify()</code> or I can do the check with the signature <code>signedXml.CheckSignature(certificate, false)</code>.</p>

<p>However both return false.</p>

<p>I think this is because they're being checked against the machine store or possibly online (I'm not sure how to check). I want to check them against the <code>X509Certificate2Collection</code> retrieved from the <code>.p7b</code> file instead - the certificates registered on the machine should be ignored and just the <code>.p7b</code> certificates checked.</p>

<p>There doesn't appear to be any way to pass the <code>X509Certificate2Collection</code> to either the <code>Verify</code> or <code>CheckSignature</code> methods.</p>

<p>Is this the right check to be doing on the SAML response?</p>

<p>Is there any way to use the <code>.p7b</code> certificates the way I want to?</p>
","<p>Have you tried using a custom <code>X509Chain</code> configured to search an <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.x509certificates.x509chainpolicy.extrastore.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ExtraStore</code></a> of certificates during the validation process. Something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>// Placeholder for the certificate to validate
var targetCertificate = new X509Certificate2();
// Placeholder for the extra collection of certificates to be used
var certificates = new X509Certificate2Collection();

var chain = new X509Chain();

chain.ChainPolicy.RevocationMode = X509RevocationMode.NoCheck;
chain.ChainPolicy.ExtraStore.AddRange(certificates);

bool isValidCertificate = chain.Build(targetCertificate);
</code></pre>

<p>In the example the revocation check is also disabled but if you have online or offline access to the CRL you could enable it. </p>

<hr />

<p>The <code>ExtraStore</code> should allow to include intermediate certificates that are not in the machine/user store. However, the trusted root certificate may need to be in the machine or user store depending on the one specified in <code>X509Chain</code> because otherwise you'll get an <code>UntrustedRoot</code> fail. If not even the root can be available in a machine or user store you could try to walk up the resulting chain and guarantee that the only error you have is due to an untrusted root and at the same time guaranteeing that the chain root is what you would expect based on the <code>X509Certificate2Collection</code> you have for validation.</p>

<p>Alternatively you could create your own custom <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.identitymodel.selectors.x509certificatevalidator.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>X509CertificateValidator</code></a> to validate a certificate taking only in consideration a provided <code>X509Certificate2Collection</code>.</p>

<p>I'm struggling with this issue for almost 5 days - I'm surely not expert on digital signature or certificates.</p>

<p>From what I learned so far - to create message like that I should do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sign the <code>xml</code> with my <code>private key</code></li>
<li>Envelope that blob with my <code>public key</code></li>
</ol>

<p>But how could the recipient check whether I am the real sender? Should I add to <code>HttpWebRequest</code> parameter with my certificate? Or that step 2 - Enveloping the message is enough for him to check that?</p>

<p>Thank you everyone for your time and replies. </p>

<p>I'm struggling with this issue for almost 5 days - I'm surely not expert on digital signature or certificates.</p>

<p>From what I learned so far - to create message like that I should do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sign the <code>xml</code> with my <code>private key</code></li>
<li>Envelope that blob with my <code>public key</code></li>
</ol>

<p>But how could the recipient check whether I am the real sender? Should I add to <code>HttpWebRequest</code> parameter with my certificate? Or that step 2 - Enveloping the message is enough for him to check that?</p>

<p>Thank you everyone for your time and replies. </p>
","<p>Your code tries digitally sign byte representation of XML, but signing XML requires more processing before signing. For example XML requires to be canonicalized (or signed message can be injected with unsigned data), and there is a special format for enveloped signatures. I don't know what is actual method Danovy Portal uses, but if it uses standard way, you can follow the links below and sign your data.   </p>

<p>I've got the key-chain and SAML XML, despite <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6099467"">a few issues</a>.</p>

<p>First I get the SAML assertion from the HTTPS POST:</p>

<pre><code>// spec says ""SAMLResponse="" 
string rawSamlData = Request[""SAMLResponse""];

// read the base64 encoded bytes
byte[] samlData = Convert.FromBase64String(rawSamlData);

// read back into a UTF string
string samlAssertion = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(samlData);

// get the SAML data in an XML reader
var assertionPostStream = new StringReader(samlAssertion);
var reader = XmlReader.Create(assertionPostStream);
</code></pre>

<p>Then I get the keys provided by my IdP:</p>

<pre><code>// get the key data
byte[] certificateData = System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(""myKeys.p7b"");

// decode the keys
var cms = new SignedCms(SubjectIdentifierType.IssuerAndSerialNumber);
cms.Decode(certificateData);

// we have a keychain of X509Certificate2s, we need a collection of tokens
var certificatesAsTokens =
    from X509Certificate2 cert in cms.Certificates
    select new X509SecurityToken(cert) as SecurityToken;

// get a token resolver
var tokens = new ReadOnlyCollection&lt;SecurityToken&gt;(
    certificatesAsTokens.ToList());
var resolver = SecurityTokenResolver.CreateDefaultSecurityTokenResolver(
    tokens, true);
</code></pre>

<p>Finally I get an error thrown here: </p>

<pre><code>// use the WS Security stuff to parse the reader
var securityToken = WSSecurityTokenSerializer.
    DefaultInstance.ReadToken(reader, resolver) as SamlSecurityToken;
</code></pre>

<p>When calling that <code>ReadToken</code> I get the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cannot read the token from the 'Response' element with the 'urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol' namespace for BinarySecretSecurityToken, with a '' ValueType. If this element is expected to be valid, ensure that security is configured to consume tokens with the name, namespace and value type specified.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My SAML XML starts with:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Response xmlns=""urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol"" ...
</code></pre>

<p>So clearly I have a <code>Response</code> element in the <code>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol</code> namespace.</p>

<p>Any idea what's wrong/missing here?</p>
","<p>It looks like you are receiving a SAML2 response. Although there is support for SAML2 in .NET 4.5, there is unfortunately only support for the assertions - not the protocol itself (including the Response message).</p>

<p>To process the SAML2 response in .NET you have to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Validate the signature on the entire response message.</li>
<li>Extract the assertion part of the message.</li>
<li>Read the token with <code>Saml2SecurityTokenHandler.ReadToken()</code>.</li>
<li>Validate the token with <code>Saml2SecurityTokenHandler.DetectReplayedToken()</code>.</li>
<li>Validate the token with <code>Saml2SecurityTokenHandler.ValidateConditions()</code></li>
<li>Use <code>Saml2SecurityTokenHandler.CreateClaims()</code> to create a claims identity.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately most of those methods are protected, but you can subclass <code>Saml2SecurityTokenHandler</code> and get access to them.</p>

","<p>OK, finally got it.</p>

<p>First of all, PKCS messages are complex structures binary-encoded using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ASN1</a>.</p>

<p>Second, they can be serialized to binary files (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Encoding_Rules#DER_encoding"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DER encoding</a>) or text PEM files using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Base64</a> encoding.</p>

<p>Third, <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2315"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PKCS#7 format</a> specifies several package types from which my is called Signed Data. These formats are distinguished by OBJECT IDENTIFIER value in the beginning of the ASN1 object (1st element of the wrapper sequence) — you can go to <a href=""http://lapo.it/asn1js/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://lapo.it/asn1js/</a> and paste the <a href=""http://pastebin.com/7ay7F99e"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">package text</a> for the fully parsed structure.</p>

<p>Next, we need to parse the package (Base64 -> ASN1 -> some object representation). Unfortunately, there's no npm package for that. I found quite a good project <a href=""https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">forge</a> that is not published to npm registry (though npm-compatible). It parsed PEM format but the resulting tree is quite an unpleasant thing to traverse. Based on their Encrypted Data and Enveloped Data implementations I created partial implementation of Signed Data in my own fork. <strong>UPD:</strong> my pull request was later merged to the forge project.</p>

<p>Now finally we have the whole thing parsed. 
At that point I found a great (and probably the only on the whole web) explanative article on signed PKCS#7 verification: <a href=""http://qistoph.blogspot.com/2012/01/manual-verify-pkcs7-signed-data-with.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://qistoph.blogspot.com/2012/01/manual-verify-pkcs7-signed-data-with.html</a></p>

<p>I was able to extract and successfully decode the signature from the file, but the hash inside was different from the data's hash. God bless Chris who <a href=""http://qistoph.blogspot.com/2012/01/manual-verify-pkcs7-signed-data-with.html?showComment=1366358745362#c7080164702597052179"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">explained</a> what actually happens.</p>

<p>The data signing process is 2-step:</p>

<ol>
<li>original content's hash is calculated</li>
<li>a set of ""Authorized Attributes"" is constructed including: type of the data singed, signing time and data hash</li>
</ol>

<p>Then the set from step 2 is signed using the signer's private key.</p>

<p>Due to PKCS#7 specifics this set of attributes is stored inside of the context-specific constructed type (class=0x80, type=0) but should be signed and validated as normal SET (class=0, type=17).</p>

<p>As Chris mentions (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/16154756/108533"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/16154756/108533</a>) this only verifies that the attributes in the package are valid. We should also validate the actual data hash against the digest attribute.</p>

<p>So finally here's a code doing validation (<code>cert.pem</code> is a certificate file that the provider sent me, <code>package</code> is a PEM-encoded message I got from them over HTTP POST):</p>

<pre><code>var fs = require('fs');
var crypto = require('crypto');
var forge = require('forge');
var pkcs7 = forge.pkcs7; 
var asn1 = forge.asn1;
var oids = forge.pki.oids;

var folder = '/a/path/to/files/';
var pkg = fs.readFileSync(folder + 'package').toString();
var cert = fs.readFileSync(folder + 'cert.pem').toString();


var res = true;

try {
    var msg = pkcs7.messageFromPem(pkg);
    var attrs = msg.rawCapture.authenticatedAttributes;
    var set = asn1.create(asn1.Class.UNIVERSAL, asn1.Type.SET, true, attrs);
    var buf = Buffer.from(asn1.toDer(set).data, 'binary');

    var sig = msg.rawCapture.signature;

    var v = crypto.createVerify('RSA-SHA1');
    v.update(buf);
    if (!v.verify(cert, sig)) {
        console.log('Wrong authorized attributes!');
        res = false;
    }

    var h = crypto.createHash('SHA1');
    var data = msg.rawCapture.content.value[0].value[0].value;
    h.update(data);

    var attrDigest = null;
    for (var i = 0, l = attrs.length; i &lt; l; ++i) {
        if (asn1.derToOid(attrs[i].value[0].value) === oids.messageDigest) {
            attrDigest = attrs[i].value[1].value[0].value;
        }
    }

    var dataDigest = h.digest();
    if (dataDigest !== attrDigest) {
        console.log('Wrong content digest');
        res = false;
    }

}
catch (_e) {
    console.dir(_e);
    res = false;
}

if (res) {
    console.log(""It's OK"");

","<p>Your answer is a big step in the right direction. You are however missing out an essential part of the validation!</p>

<p>You should verify the hash of the data against the digest contained in the signed attributes. Otherwise it would be possible for someone to replace the content with malicious data. Try for example validating the following 'package' with your code (and have a look at the content): <a href=""http://pastebin.com/kaZ2XQQc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/kaZ2XQQc</a></p>

<pre><code>$ openssl smime -verify -in data.p7s -CAfile root-certificate.pem 
Verification successful
Signed data
</code></pre>

<p>But when I extract the signed part, I do not see that it is actually the same as what was signed. I mean the following steps:</p>

<pre><code>$ openssl asn1parse -in data.p7s
...
   35:d=4  hl=2 l=   9 prim: OBJECT            :pkcs7-data
   46:d=4  hl=2 l=inf  cons: cont [ 0 ]        
   48:d=5  hl=2 l=inf  cons: OCTET STRING      
   50:d=6  hl=2 l=   5 prim: OCTET STRING      :(my data is here in plaintext)
...
(then the signed block starts:)
 2861:d=6  hl=2 l=   9 prim: OBJECT            :rsaEncryption
 2872:d=6  hl=2 l=   0 prim: NULL              
 2874:d=5  hl=4 l= 256 prim: OCTET STRING      [HEX DUMP]:&lt;signed data is here&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I cut the <code>[HEX DUMP]</code> with the signed data:</p>

<pre><code>$ dd if=data.p7s of=signed-part.bin bs=1 skip=2878 count=256
</code></pre>

<p>Decrypt it with the corresponding public key:</p>

<pre><code>$ openssl rsautl -verify -in signed-part.bin -pubin -inkey root-public-key.pem -out verified-data.bin
</code></pre>

<p>and look inside the result:</p>

<pre><code>$ openssl asn1parse -inform der -in verified-data.bin
    0:d=0  hl=2 l=  33 cons: SEQUENCE          
    2:d=1  hl=2 l=   9 cons: SEQUENCE          
    4:d=2  hl=2 l=   5 prim: OBJECT            :sha1
   11:d=2  hl=2 l=   0 prim: NULL              
   13:d=1  hl=2 l=  20 prim: OCTET STRING      [HEX DUMP]:&lt;hash here&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This <code>[HEX DUMP]</code> is <em>not</em> the SHA1 sum of my original data.</p>

<p>I do not understand why the hash is different. Obviously, it's a hash of something different than my original data. Does the hash also cover any ""Authenticated attributes""? If yes, how to see what exactly attributes have been hashed and signed?</p>
","<p>OK, you don't provide a full sample, but I'll try to navigate you nevertheless, with a different sample.</p>

<p>OpenSSL <code>asn1parse</code> does not help much identifying the authenticated attributes. You can use OpenSSL <code>cms</code>:</p>

<pre><code>openssl cms -in data.p7s -noout -cmsout -print
</code></pre>

<p>Look for <code>signedAttrs</code> (""signed attributes"" is how the ""authenticated attributes"" are now called, in CMS terminology)</p>

<p>It will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>    ...
    signerInfos:
        ...
        signedAttrs:
            object: contentType (1.2.840.113549.1.9.3)
            value.set:
              OBJECT:pkcs7-data (1.2.840.113549.1.7.1)    
            object: signingTime (1.2.840.113549.1.9.5)
            ...
</code></pre>

<p>Now go back to <code>asn1parse</code> output, and find the corresponding part, which may look like:</p>

<pre><code> ...
 1343:d=5  hl=3 l= 216 cons:      cont [ 0 ]
 1346:d=6  hl=2 l=  24 cons:       SEQUENCE
 1348:d=7  hl=2 l=   9 prim:        OBJECT            :contentType
 1359:d=7  hl=2 l=  11 cons:        SET
 1361:d=8  hl=2 l=   9 prim:         OBJECT            :pkcs7-data
 1372:d=6  hl=2 l=  28 cons:       SEQUENCE
 1374:d=7  hl=2 l=   9 prim:        OBJECT            :signingTime
 ...
</code></pre>

<p>(for this nice indentation, add <code>-i</code> option)</p>

<p>Now, extract (<code>dd ...</code>) the data, including the DER context tag header, i.e. offset 1343, length 219, in this case. Then replace the <code>0xa0</code> byte at the beginning by <code>0x31</code>.

<p>I still cant get the right encryption. Anyone can help or give suggestion?</p>
","<p>Guessing from the given input, you should run into Javas restriction of the key length:
Since the US doesn't allow usage of hard security keys, Java is restricted to a key length of 128bit per default.</p>

<p>To enable keys >128bit you have to change the policy of your Java version with the offical ""unlimited"" policies (<a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here for SE8</a>)</p>

I have two certificates (stored into smartcard) and the first works fine; I create the p7s and next I validate correctly, but the second certificate allows me to create the p7s, file but when I validate it, it returns the SignatureException.

<p>In this code, (extracted from an example in the net), I changed the generators key and took it from my card. I got the exception again, without using PKCS7 files.</p>

<p>Looking at all providers (with Security.getProviders() you can get all of them; they are defined in java.security file, but it can be added to or taken from in runtime), and I used everyone to sign and validate, I found out that:</p>

<ol>
<li>If no one provider is selected when Signature is instantiated, it uses SunRsaSign by default.</li>
<li>My Signature is validated with 2 providers:<br>
a) With SunMSCAPI provider, which uses Microsoft Crypt API.<br>
b) With the provider created by smart card reader, in my case Siemens.</li>
<li>Reading another smart card that does not belong to Siemens, it is validated with SunRsaSign and SunJSSE.</li>
</ol>

<p>At this moment, I find out the problem and a workarournd using SunMSCAPI to validate, but I have to validate into an IBM machine.  Siemens software provides an option to install into Unix, but I cannot get it to work. And using SunMSCAPI, I suppose it isn't available for IBM.</p>

<p>So, I have to find out a provider that validates correctly in IMB the Signature that SunRsaSign returns SignatureException.</p>

<p>So how can I load this .p7b file ?</p>
","<p>Finally I did it with BouncyCastle library.</p>

<p>PKCS#7 is a complex format, also called CMS. Sun JCE has no direct support to PKCS#7.</p>

<p>This is the code that I used to extract my content:</p>

<pre><code>// Loading the file first
   File f = new File(""myFile.p7b"");
   byte[] buffer = new byte[(int) f.length()];
   DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(new FileInputStream(f));
   in.readFully(buffer);
   in.close();

   Store cs = signature.getCertificates();
   SignerInformationStore signers = signature.getSignerInfos();
   Collection c = signers.getSigners();
   Iterator it = c.iterator();

   //the following array will contain the content of xml document
   byte[] data = null;

   while (it.hasNext()) {
        SignerInformation signer = (SignerInformation) it.next();
        Collection certCollection = cs.getMatches(signer.getSID());
        Iterator certIt = certCollection.iterator();
        X509CertificateHolder cert = (X509CertificateHolder) certIt.next();

        CMSProcessable sc = signature.getSignedContent();
        data = (byte[]) sc.getContent();
    }

<p>If you want to verify the signature of this PKCS7 file against X509 certificate, you must add the following code to the while loop:</p>

<pre><code>// ************************************************************* //
// ********************* Verify signature ********************** //

<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9869828/message-level-security-in-rest-web-services"">Message Level Security in Rest Web services</a></p>

<p>only partially helpful. </p>

<p>We currently support standard SSL transport security and several authentication methods including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic http auth (required by some network equipment services that
talk to our API's)</li>
<li>HMAC with pre-shared secrete key in both SHA1 and    SHA256 flavors.</li>
<li>Client identity certs sent @ the TLS level. </li>
<li>SAML 2.0</li>
</ul>

<p>Why we need message level security because:</p>

<ul>
<li>Customer industries include health care, financial and government, among others, and they often frown on SSL only.</li>
<li>Need to guarantee end to end security. Through reverse proxies, SSL accelerators, etc... </li>
<li>Some data passed through the services will include very sensitive data. </li>
<li>Need to have a good answer for customers that insist that SOAP's WS-* security standards are  ""Enterprise strength"" web services and REST APIs are not.</li>
</ul>

<p>My initial thought is to use an PKCS#7 envelope, as an option, if client applications understand how to process enveloped responses. </p>

<p>I want client applications to tell the API that they want a secured response or tell the API that the message they are POSTing or PUTing is secured.</p>

<p>My real question is, should this be communicated through a media type? E.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li>Content-Type: application/vnd.resourcetype1+json+pkcs7</li>
<li>Content-Type: txt/csv+pkcs7</li>
</ul>

<p>i don't want to loose information on the media type that is enveloped. </p>

<p>It gets complicated as in some cases the signature is enough. Others require encryption as well. The term ""pkcs7"" is vague as to how the envelope is constructed. </p>

<p>I want the client and server to tell each other the type of content they are sending and the type of content they understand through standard HTTP headers.</p>
","<p>Of course, it is up to you how to define your API, there is no right or wrong way, however <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3851"" rel=""nofollow"">S/MIME</a> is a very well understood message format, well suited to the internet. As is <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2015"" rel=""nofollow"">PGP/MIME</a> if your prefer a de-centralised trust hierarchy. Since these are well understood formats, it will allow clients to adopt existing libraries to process these message bodies.</p>

<p>If you are adament you do not want to use a multi-part response, you may want to take a look at the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.11"" rel=""nofollow"">Content-Encoding</a> header, besides just Content-Type. You could then specify the signature/encryption format as a custom encoding type.</p>

<p>There are significant benefits to using HTTP as an application protocol and not just a transport protocol, but you seem to understand that already. Be sure you set and parse the Accept* headers correctly, including q-values. Beware of things such as the default of q=1 meaning equal (not descending) preference, and q=0.</p>

","<p>Smartcard or Token driver (PKCS#11) library has an additional layer called CSP (Crypto Service Provider) which acts like bridge between the device driver and OS Crypto services.

","<p>[Disclosure: I work for CoSign.]</p>

<p>The problem that you're running into is a common one with old-style PKI systems that store the  signer's private key at the boundary (eg in a smart card, a token, etc). This system was designed when the PC (and apps running on it) was the focus. But that isn't true this century. Now either the browser or the mobile is the focus.</p>

<p>You have tension between the nature of web apps (they're either running on the host or are sandboxed JavaScript on the browser) versus the idea of local hardware that ""protects"" the private key.</p>

<p><strong>Breaking out of the browser's sandbox</strong></p>

<p>One design direction is to try to break out of the browser's sandbox to access the local hardware private key store. You've listed a number of options. An additional one is the <a href=""http://developer.chrome.com/apps/usb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Chrome USB access library</a>. But all of these solutions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Limited to specific browsers</li>
<li>Hard (and expensive) to install</li>
<li>Hard (and expensive) to maintain</li>
<li>High level of administrative overhead to help the users with their questions about keeping the system working.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Re your question 5 ""Any other options?""</strong></p>

<p><strong>Yes: Centralized signing</strong></p>

<p>A better option (IMHO) is to sign centrally. This way the keys are kept in a centralized FIPS-secure server. Meanwhile, the signers just use a webapp to authorize the signing. The signers don't need to hold the private key since it is stored in the secure server.</p>

<p>To authenticate the signers, you can use whatever level of security your app needs: user name/password; One Time Password; two factor authentication via SMS; etc.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.arx.com/digital-signatures/sapi"" rel=""nofollow"">CoSign Signature API</a> and <a href=""http://www.arx.com/digital-signatures/cswa"" rel=""nofollow"">CoSign Signature Web Agent</a> are designed for this. Centralized PKI signing is also available from other vendors.</p>

<p><strong>Added in response to comment</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>From the 2nd part of your answer - If the certificate is stored in the server and retrieved by authenticating the user by using uname/pwd or with 2FA, then why do digital signing at all? i.e. what advantage does it offer over just authenticating the transaction with uname/pwd or 2FA?</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>A:</strong> In the centralized design, the private key does <em>not</em> leave the central server. Rather, the document or data to be signed is sent to the server, is signed, and then the signed doc or data (e.g. XML) is returned to the webapp. </p>

<p>Re: why do this? Because a digitally signed document or data set (eg XML) can be <em>verified</em> to guarantee that the document was not changed since signed and provides a trust chain to provide assurance of the signer's identity. In contrast, passwords, even when strengthed by 2FA etc, only provide the <em>app</em> with signer identity assurance, not third parties.</p>

<p>PKI digital signing enables <em>third parties</em> to assure themselves of the signer's identity through the verification process. And the strength of the assurance can be set, as needed, by choosing different CAs.</p>

"19410688","PKCS#7 Signature Verification","<p>I am trying to implement signature verification for PDFs. It is a big topic so I am taking it one step at a time, first I am trying to actually return a positive in the case of a PDF I have signed myself, using all the default values with the current Acrobat — that should be SHA256 for the digest, and a PKCS7 detached signature. So, I crack out openssl, and by reading the byte range given in the PDF and calling the <code>SHA256_*</code> functions I have a hash to compare against. So now I need to read the certificate data etc, and use the <code>PKCS7_*</code> functions. This one looks to be the one I want:</p>

<pre><code>int PKCS7_verify(PKCS7 *p7, STACK_OF(X509) *certs, X509_STORE *store, BIO *indata, BIO *out, int flags);
</code></pre>

<p>as <a href=""http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/PKCS7_verify.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">found in the documentation</a>. Except said documentation doesn't tell me how to construct any of these things. Ok, so I think the <code>BIO *indata</code> can be made with some of the functions in <a href=""http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/BIO_new.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> and the array of certs using <a href=""http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/X509_new.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">these</a> (despite having not worked out the precise details), but what about the <code>PKCS7 *p7</code>, or the <code>STACK_OF(x)</code> called for. I cannot find any documented way of initialising these structures. There are some pkcs7_ctrl functions in the <code>pkcs7.h</code> header:-</p>

<pre><code>long PKCS7_ctrl(PKCS7 *p7, int cmd, long larg, char *parg);

int PKCS7_set_type(PKCS7 *p7, int type);
int PKCS7_set0_type_other(PKCS7 *p7, int type, ASN1_TYPE *other);
int PKCS7_set_content(PKCS7 *p7, PKCS7 *p7_data);
int PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO_set(PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO *p7i, X509 *x509, EVP_PKEY *pkey, const EVP_MD *dgst);
int PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO_sign(PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO *si);
int PKCS7_add_signer(PKCS7 *p7, PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO *p7i);
int PKCS7_add_certificate(PKCS7 *p7, X509 *x509);
int PKCS7_add_crl(PKCS7 *p7, X509_CRL *x509);
int PKCS7_content_new(PKCS7 *p7, int nid);
int PKCS7_dataVerify(X509_STORE *cert_store, X509_STORE_CTX *ctx,
    BIO *bio, PKCS7 *p7, PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO *si); 
int PKCS7_signatureVerify(BIO *bio, PKCS7 *p7, PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO *si, X509 *x509);

BIO *PKCS7_dataInit(PKCS7 *p7, BIO *bio);
int PKCS7_dataFinal(PKCS7 *p7, BIO *bio);
BIO *PKCS7_dataDecode(PKCS7 *p7, EVP_PKEY *pkey, BIO *in_bio, X509 *pcert);
</code></pre>

<p>but without some guidelines this doesn't seem like a forest it would be efficacious to start blindly poking around in. </p>

<p>Have I missed something obvious? How do I go about calling this function with the data values I have parsed from the PDF?</p>
","<p>Ok, found all this out the (very) hard way. This is how you do it, so that others might learn more easily.</p>

<p>Lets say we have the signature <code>char* sig</code> of length <code>int sig_length</code>, and verification data <code>char* data</code>, <code>int data_length</code>. (There are some subtleties here for PDF signatures but these are well documented in the PDF spec.)</p>

<pre><code>OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms();
OpenSSL_add_all_digests();
EVP_add_digest(EVP_md5());
EVP_add_digest(EVP_sha1());
EVP_add_digest(EVP_sha256());

BIO* sig_BIO = BIO_new_mem_buf(sig, sig_length)
PKCS7* sig_pkcs7 = d2i_PKCS7_bio(sig_BIO, NULL);

BIO* data_BIO = BIO_new_mem_buf(data, data_length)
BIO* data_pkcs7_BIO = PKCS7_dataInit(sig_pkcs7, data_BIO);

// Goto this place in the BIO. Why? No idea!
char unneeded[1024*4];
while (BIO_read(dataPKCS7_BIO, unneeded, sizeof(buffer)) &gt; 0);

int result;
X509_STORE *certificateStore = X509_STORE_new();
X509_STORE_CTX certificateContext;
STACK_OF(PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO) *signerStack = PKCS7_get_signer_info(sig_pkcs7);
int numSignerInfo = sk_PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO_num(signerStack);
for (int i=0; i&lt;numSignerInfo; ++i) {
    PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO *signerInfo = sk_PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO_value(signerStack, i);
    result = PKCS7_dataVerify(certificateStore, &amp;certificateContext, data_pkcs7_BIO, sig_pkcs7, signerInfo);
}

X509_STORE_CTX_cleanup(&amp;certificateContext);
BIO_free(sig_BIO);
BIO_free(data_BIO);
BIO_free(data_pkcs7_BIO);
PKCS7_free(sig_pkcs7);
X509_STORE_free(certificateStore);
</code></pre>

<p>The function that does the work is actually PKCS7_dataVerify, and you don't need to run any digests yourself.</p>

<p>But wait, if you try this, it won't work! Why? Because the verification does both trust and integrity. In addition to this, you will also need to either establish trust by adding certs to the store, which is also complicated and undocumented. If you want fine grain results for you'll want to set a callback on the verification via the certificate store like this:</p>

<pre><code>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags(certificateStore-&gt;param, X509_V_FLAG_CB_ISSUER_CHECK);
X509_STORE_set_verify_cb_func(certificateStore, verificationCallback);
</code></pre>

<p>where</p>

<pre><code>static int verificationCallback(int ok, X509_STORE_CTX *ctx) {
    switch (ctx-&gt;error)
    {
        case X509_V_ERR_INVALID_PURPOSE: //...
        case X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED: //...
        case X509_V_ERR_KEYUSAGE_NO_CERTSIGN: //... 
        case X509_V_ERR_DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT: //...
        // ... etc
        default: break;
    }
    return ok;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can set the error to ok and tell it to verify, for example if you want to ignore expired certs:</p>

<pre><code>static int verificationCallback(int ok, X509_STORE_CTX *ctx) {
    switch (ctx-&gt;error)
    {
        case X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED: 
            X509_STORE_CTX_set_error(ctx, X509_V_OK);
            ok = 1;
            break;
    }
    return ok;
}

"25162605","Signature Verification (formate is PKCS#7)","<p>I have following in the XML
1.  tag : Signature in this is in the PKCS#7 format, This is an international standard. The signature includes the Signer's public key certificate as part of the PKCS#7 bag, along with the encrypted hash of data. 
2. tag: Original Data  is in this tag. </p>

<p>I don't understand how to verify the signature. Client said that ""Any API /  tool that can read the PKCS#7 Signature can give you the Public Key."" </p>

<p>The examples which I saw require public key separately to verify the signature. Is it even possible that required public key float with signature and some tool will automatically identify it and verify the data?
If yes, I am not able to find any java API which will verify this signature.</p>
","<p>As a prologue, first rule of cryptography : do not do it yourself, use proven tools in their documented use cases to perform the operations.</p>

<p>So I'd first check if you XML document is indeed signed using a standard (I don't know of an XML signature format that is based on PKCS7, but then, I sure don't know everything). If so, I'd find a library that supports this specific format. </p>

<p>XML Signature is standardized along the <code>XMLD Sig</code> umbrella, formalized here : <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/</a>. The Oracle JDK ships with a reference implementation (that is derived from an Apache implementation of the standard), using the <code>XMLSignatureFactory</code> base class.</p>

<p>PKCS7 is not used as part of XML DSig, though, so you may have to ""do it yourself"" (a small enough part of if) in the end, unless there is a protocol that I do not know of.</p>

<p>That said, indeed PKCS7 (superseeded in some cases by CMS) is a standard cryptographic format that allows the signature of arbitrary content. The structure is flexible enough to hold notably : the content to be signed (it can be embedded, or not), the signature and associated algorithm identifiers, plus X509 material linked to the signature (such as Certificates and public keys, certificate revocation lists...).</p>

<p>The Java language does not provide a generic implementation of PKCS7 processing to my knowledge, although the Oracle JDK does under the <code>sun.security.pkcs</code> package. </p>

<p>A popular, common library for PKCS7 processing in Java is BouncyCastle. I'm more familiar with it, so this is what I'll talk about.  </p>

<p>You can find a usage sample here :
<a href=""http://i-proving.com/2007/09/21/pkcs7-signatures-using-bouncy-castle/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://i-proving.com/2007/09/21/pkcs7-signatures-using-bouncy-castle/</a></p>

<p>Bouncy Castle has a fairly good example package when you download the source, and also Javadoc. So you can check it out for up-to-date usage of the API. Check for example : 
<a href=""https://www.bouncycastle.org/docs/pkixdocs1.5on/org/bouncycastle/cms/CMSSignedData.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.bouncycastle.org/docs/pkixdocs1.5on/org/bouncycastle/cms/CMSSignedData.html</a>, reproduced here for easier reference</p>

<pre><code>CMSSignedData           s = new CMSSignedData(inputStream);
Store                   certStore = s.getCertificates(); // This is where you access embedded certificates

  if (signer.verify(new JcaSimpleSignerInfoVerifierBuilder().setProvider(""BC"").build(cert)))

<p>Remember though, that checking the validity of the signature is one step, the second is to verify that the signing certificates are indeed trustworthy. An example is available here :</p>

For this I will get a signed sha256 data of PDF in PKCS#1 format and a certificate from a device, I need to use these two to embed inside the PDF. Most of the PDF reader only support PKCS#7 signature.</p>

<p>Is there any way to convert a PKCS#1 signature to PKCS#7 signature  (using certificate file) ?</p>

<p>I knew that PKCS#7 = Certificate + Optional raw data + Signature in PKCS#1 format</p>
","<p>Your question somewhat oversimplifies the situation.</p>

<p>Concerning PKCS#7 &lt;-> PKCS#1:</p>

<p>Yes, a PKCS#7 signature container contains SignerInfo objects which respectively essentially contain a PKCS#1 style signature and some attributes. BUT this PKCS#1 style signature generally is NOT merely signing the document data but instead is signing a structure of so called ""signed attributes"". One of these is a document hash, others can be the signing time, a link to the signer certificate, and other information; these extra information is required in many use cases. Only the most primitively built SignerInfo structures sign the document data directly.</p>

<p>In general, therefore, if you simply take a PKCS#1 signature of some data and wrap it in a PKCS#7 container, that signature container won't be accepted.</p>

<p>For details see <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3852.txt"" rel=""noreferrer"">RFC 3852</a>.</p>

<p>Concerning integrated PDF signatures:</p>

<p>Your description of your implementation-to-be is somewhat vague. You seem to think that the document hash to sign is a hash of the original PDF. In case of integrated PDF signatures this is wrong: In order to create an integrated PDF signature, you first extend the PDF by some data which envelop a placeholder for the PKCS#7 signature container (recommended by the specification) or the PKCS#1 signature to integrate. Then you need to hash this extended PDF except the placeholder. (By the current PDF specification you could hash less than that but this won't be accepted by the current Adobe Acrobat/Reader and shouldn't be accepted by any serious verifier).</p>

<p>For details see <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">ISO 32000-1:2008 as published by Adobe</a></p>

<p>Depending on the legal requirements you may also have to take into account PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures (PAdES) as specified by ETSI, cf. <a href=""http://www.etsi.org/website/newsandevents/200909_electronicsignature.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">ETSI standard for EU-compliant electronic signatures</a>. These will become part of ISO 32000-2, aka PDF 2.0.</p>

<p>So, are you still sure your use case allows for those very simple PKCS#7 signatures you have in mind, and are your PKCS#1 source signatures created for the right document? In that case building those containers is easily done by looking at <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3852.txt"" rel=""noreferrer"">RFC 3852</a>.</p>

<p>Anyways, you should have a look at the whitepaper <a href=""http://itextpdf.com/book/digitalsignatures"" rel=""noreferrer"">Digital Signatures for PDF documents</a> by Bruno Lowagie (iText Software).</p>

","<p>A PKCS#7 file generally contains a chain of certificates.  That is, a Root CA certificate, any intermediate CA certificates that apply, and then the endpoint certificate (SSL, e-mail, etc.)  A PKCS#7 is typically used to bundle these up into a single file.  It's useful, in that you can import the entire chain at once into a keystore or other relying application.</p>

<p>As to the key usage bits, those are set depending on the needs and purpose of a particular certificate.  For example, a Root CA certificate would typically have both digital signature and non-repudiation set.  For an SSL certificate, you may find key encipherment and digital signature.  There's really no correlation between key usage and PKCS#7 files, unless you're talking about the CA certificates contained in the PKCS#7 file.</p>

<ol>
<li>Verify the digital signature to ensure that response was sent by the provider</li>
<li>Get an Xml formatted message from this response</li>
</ol>

<p>I have been primarily using the <a href=""http://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/"" rel=""nofollow"">Bouncy Castle</a> library and the MS <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.pkcs.signedcms%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">SignedCms Class</a><br>
In summary, I am getting absolutely nowhere.</p>

<p>Please can someone guide me on what to do here as I've been at this for about 5 days and am going nowhere fast.  </p>

<p>Here is some of what I'm doing so far:</p>

<p><strong>Make the request</strong></p>

<p>Using the HttpWebRequest and HttpWebResponse i am posting data to the service using my supplied certificate</p>

<pre><code>var store = new X509Store(StoreLocation.LocalMachine);
store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly | OpenFlags.OpenExistingOnly);
X509Certificate2 cert = store.Certificates.Find(X509FindType.FindByThumbprint, ""ACLKJCLKJCLKJCLKJCLKJCLKJCLKJCLKJCLKJCLK"", false)[0];

HttpWebRequest request = null;
var uri = new Uri(endPointUri);
request = (HttpWebRequest) WebRequest.Create(uri);
request.Method = ""POST"";
request.ContentType = ""application/pkcs7-mime"";
request.ContentLength = requestString.Length;
request.ClientCertificates.Add(cert);

using (Stream writeStream = request.GetRequestStream())
{
    var encoding = new UTF8Encoding();
    byte[] bytes = encoding.GetBytes(requestString);
    writeStream.Write(bytes, 0, bytes.Length);
}
string result = null;
using (var response = (HttpWebResponse) request.GetResponse())
{
    using (Stream responseStream = response.GetResponseStream())
    {
        if (responseStream != null)
        {
            using (var readStream = new StreamReader(responseStream, Encoding.UTF8))
            {
                result = readStream.ReadToEnd();
            }
        }
    }
}

return result;
</code></pre>

<p>Here I get back the ""BEGIN PKCS7"" message from above.<br>
Now I'm trying to figure out what to do with this</p>

<p><strong>MS Signed CMS Class Approach</strong></p>

<pre><code>SignedCms signedCms = new SignedCms();
signedCms.Decode(Encoding.Default.GetBytes(resultString));
try
{
    signedCms.CheckSignature(new X509Certificate2Collection(cert1), true);
}
catch (System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException e)
{
    _Log.Error(e.Message)
}
</code></pre>

<p>This throws the exception on ""signedCms.Decode"" of ""ASN1 bad tag value met.""</p>

<p><strong>BouncyCastle ISigner</strong></p>

<p>Here the documentation is non-existent.<br>
So first I save my response to a file and use the TextReader object to try test with BouncyCastle</p>

<pre><code>using (TextReader reader = File.OpenText(@""c:\temp\resultString.txt""))
{
    PemReader pemRd = new PemReader(reader);
    ContentInfo d = (ContentInfo)pemRd.ReadObject();
    Console.WriteLine(d.ContentType.ToString());
}
</code></pre>

<p>This returns the result: ""1.2.840.113549.1.7.2""<br>
From what i can tell, this means its ""Pkcs7 Signed Data""<br>
Woohoo, something looks like its working.<br>
But from here, how do I verify, and how do I extract any information from this</p>

<p>My Verify attempt</p>

<pre><code>using (TextReader reader = File.OpenText(@""c:\temp\resultString.txt""))
{
    PemReader pemRd = new PemReader(reader);
    var signature = new CmsSignedData(pemRd.ReadObject());
}
</code></pre>

<p>Fail - signature is null</p>

<pre><code>var store = new X509Store(StoreLocation.LocalMachine);
store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly | OpenFlags.OpenExistingOnly);
X509Certificate2 cert = store.Certificates.Find(X509FindType.FindByThumbprint, ""ACLKJCLKJCLKJCLKJCLKJCLKJCLKJCLKJCLKJCLK"", false)[0]; //tried with both certs
ISigner signer = SignerUtilities.GetSigner(""RSA"");
var bouncyx509 = DotNetUtilities.FromX509Certificate(cert1);
signer.Init(true, DotNetUtilities.FromX509Certificate(cert1).GetPublicKey());
</code></pre>

<p>Fail - need private key to create signer</p>

<p><strong>In Closing</strong></p>

<p>I hope I have provided enough information to get some help here.<br>
Maybe I'm heading in completely the wrong direction.  </p>

<p>My Questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>How do I Verify the digital signature?</li>
<li>How do I get an Xml formatted message from this response?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to gtrig, i finally have a solution.<br>
Using the MS SignedCms object I had to first remove the Header and Footer form the message, then Convert.FromBase64String</p>

<p>Working Solution</p>

<pre><code>SignedCms signedCms = new SignedCms();
resultString = resultString.Replace(""\n"", """").Replace(""-----BEGIN PKCS7-----"", """").Replace(""-----END PKCS7-----"", """");
signedCms.Decode(Convert.FromBase64String(resultString));
</code></pre>

<p>Now signedCms.ContentInfo.Content contains the reponse Xml message I expect</p>
","<p>This is an incomplete answer, but it may get you a little further along.</p>

<p>If you have access to openssl, try this <a href=""http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/pkcs7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">command</a> to see if it can read the data:</p>

<p><code>openssl pkcs7 -in resultString.txt -text</code></p>

<p>After that try this in your code (The only difference from what you had is ""Content"" instead of ""ContentType"":</p>

<pre><code>Console.WriteLine(d.Content.ToString());
</code></pre>

<p>signedCms.Decode() takes a byte array, and that is probably the DER formatted message instead of the PEM formatted message that you received in the response.  To get that in a byte array, you'll have to strip the header and footer (Begin/End) lines and pass the rest to this method: </p>

<pre><code>Convert.FromBase64String()
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you could use openssl to convert the file to DER format and then read in the bytes directly from the file.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>openssl pkcs7 -in resultString.txt -outform DER -out result.der</p>

","<p>If I correctly understand your question, your pkcs#7 is signing the whole content of the PDF. That is, all PDF file bytes.
In this case the answer is you can't.</p>

<p>When you sign a PDF file you don't sign all its bytes ""as is"".
Before signing a PDF you have to create two ""byte ranges"" in the PDF, 
leaving in the midle of the PDF enough room to include the signature.
Then you have to concatenate these two byte ranges, sign these bytes and include the signature in the space you left inside the PDF.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>an XML-message is created client-side and digitally signed using mozilla's window.crypto.signText. After signing, the message and the signature are transmitted via a webservice (.net) to the server. Everything is fine until this point.</p></li>
<li><p>on the server, the XML shall be included in another XML-document, which is publicly accessible. The signature should be published as well in order to grant non-repudiation. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Q: Is there a smooth option to convert the detached Pkcs#7 into XML-DSIG (e.g. functionality within the .net framework)? </p>

<p>Q2: Or is it possible to create the XML-DSIG already client-side without using external plugins?</p>

<p>Tnx for your help!</p>

<p>Alois Paulin</p>
","<p>Due to the nature of both digital signature formats XML and PKCS#7, it is not possible to convert from one to the other. </p>

<p>In a very simplified explanation, the signature in <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2315"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PKCS#7</a> format contains, among other stuff, some specific data structure called DigestInfo that contains the data digest and an OID (object identifier), and has been ciphered with the user's private key. The <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XML-Dsig</a> format applies the final step of the cryptographic algorithm (again with the user's private key) to a different data value calculated from digesting the original XML data and some specific XML-DSig data structures. Therefore, since both ciphered values will not be the same, it is only possible to generate the XML-DSig signature by signing the data with the user's private key, which you will not have access to (thus the name private). </p>

<p>From that explanation, the answer to your first question is <strong>""No, there is no smooth option, it is not possible at all""</strong>.</p>

<p>Therefore the only option is to generate the XML-DSig directly at the client side. That is not possible using standard Javascript, definitely not with Firefox's window.crypto (which only generates PKCS7 detached signatures). At my company (<a href=""http://www.isigma.es"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">www.isigma.es</a>), we solve that by using an applet, it is a common solution in the digital signature industry (there are many commercial and also some open source solutions). That may not be an option in your case, if you do not want browser plugins. </p>

<p>CAPICOM (the windows-based active/X component that you may use in a Microsoft setup) also does not generate XML-DSig, only CMS/PKCS7.</p>

<p>There are a lot more open libraries and implementation cases and examples of XAdES on the internet, but still, I don't believe that is the reason why people decide on using XAdES over CAdES.</p>

<p>Is it because XAdES is XML oriented and software developers tend to love anything XML related? Is there any scenario where CAdES is just outright the best option to use over XAdES?</p>

<p>For reference: </p>

<ul>
<li>CAdES is CMS/PKCS#7 in advanced form (supports timestamping)</li>
<li>XAdES is XML-DSig in advanced form (supports timestamping) </li>
</ul>
","<p>One advantage of CAdES is that it <em>generally</em> causes less interoperability problems because the XML-DSig standard allows <strong>many</strong> options including XSLT, XPointer Framework, XML canonicalization and more. CAdES would be less demanding if only dealing with strictly DER-encoded signatures (The picture changes once you need to deal with BER encodings).</p>

<p>CAdES outperforms XAdES in scenarios where producing ""attached"" signatures on large data chunks is necessary (You want the result to be one single chunk of data that contains both the original data and the signature). The equivalent of an attached CAdES signature (The original input data is stored in the EncapContentInfo element of the CMS structure) is an <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core1/#def-SignatureEnveloping"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Enveloping Signature</a>. If you are required to produce such a kind of signature there is a high probability that you will run into problems when dealing with large input data if your XAdES implementation is DOM-based (those I know of are) - your machine will eventually run out of memory.</p>

<p>Performance would be another argument where CAdES is favoured. The message digest computation of CAdES is typically done directly on the raw bytes of the input data, XML signatures that are computed on XML documents involve a lot of overhead such as evaluation of XPath expressions, XSLT transforms, Base64 en-/decoding and Canonicalization, and potentially several Transform elements.   </p>

<p>If you are building an archiving system for long-term validation of signatures where a lot of signatures are stored, CAdES is the preferred format due to its compactness in comparison to the textual XAdES format.</p>

","<p>CAdES over XAdES:</p>

<ul>
<li>Less options to implement</li>

<li>Works with any sort of data, including XML</li>
<li>Easier for ASiC</li>

<li>Can be used with S/MIME</li>
<li>Allows multiple signatures</li>
<li>It is used in PAdES</li>
<li>Faster</li>
</ul>

<p>XAdES over CAdES:</p>

<ul>
<li>Signed XML files can still be read by encryption-unaware applications</li>
<li>Multiple elements can be signed with one pass</li>
<li>You do not need an ASN.1 compiler</li>
</ul>

<p>The only reason I would use XAdES is the first one, personal opinion. But then, an unaware application might modify the file, rendering the signature invalid. Also, using the *AdES types means that you want to be compatible with the EU regulations and, this usually means PDF documents signed with PAdES. When you simply want to sign an e-mail, CAdES is not very much useful as it is not validated by most S/MIME clients. The AdES stuff is european laws, so not so many US apps are aware of it.</p>

<p>Also, these forms are not just the old ones with timestamps, there are a lot of addons.

","<p>I've faced the same issue and spent too much time but I found a way in the end.</p>

<p>I found and used <a href=""https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">forge</a> open source lib. You can simply add to your project by following:</p>

<pre><code>npm install node-forge
</code></pre>

<p>Then, code snippet below performs encryption with <code>PKCS#7</code> format.</p>

<pre><code>var forge = require('node-forge');

// create cert object
var cert = forge.pki.certificateFromPem(certOrPemString);
// create envelop data
var p7 = forge.pkcs7.createEnvelopedData();
// add certificate as recipient
p7.addRecipient(cert);
// set content 
p7.content = forge.util.createBuffer();
p7.content.putString('content to be encrypted');

// encrypt
p7.encrypt();

// obtain encrypted data with DER format
var bytes = forge.asn1.toDer(p7.toAsn1()).getBytes();
</code></pre>

<p>This code block will encrypt the content you provided and return a byte array with <code>DER</code> output format. </p>

<p>You can convert byte array to <code>UTF-8</code> string by following:</p>

<pre><code>var str = Buffer.from(bytes, 'binary').toString('utf8');
</code></pre>

<p>And you can decrypt the content as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var recipient = p7.findRecipient(cert);
// decrypt
p7.decrypt(p7.recipients[0], privateKey); 
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this may help.</p>

","<p>Well, it's complicated (I would say even impossible, but who knows) to achieve this only with PHP.</p>

<p>At first, please read <a href=""https://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/DigSig/Acrobat_DigitalSignatures_in_PDF.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article about digital signature in Adobe PDF</a></p>

<p>Second, after reading this you will know that signature is stored between b and c bytes according to /ByteRange[a b c d] indicator</p>

<p>Third, we can extract b and c from document and then extract signature itself (guide says it will be hexdecoded PKCS7# object). </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

 $content = file_get_contents('test.pdf');

 $regexp = '#ByteRange\[\s*(\d+) (\d+) (\d+)#'; // subexpressions are used to extract b and c

 $result = [];
 preg_match_all($regexp, $content, $result);

 // $result[2][0] and $result[3][0] are b and c
 if (isset($result[2]) &amp;&amp; isset($result[3]) &amp;&amp; isset($result[2][0]) &amp;&amp; isset($result[3][0]))
 {
     $start = $result[2][0];
     $end = $result[3][0];
     if ($stream = fopen('test.pdf', 'rb')) {
         $signature = stream_get_contents($stream, $end - $start - 2, $start + 1); // because we need to exclude &lt; and &gt; from start and end

         fclose($stream);
     }

     file_put_contents('signature.pkcs7', hex2bin($signature));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Forth, after third step we have PKCS#7 object in file signature.pkcs7. Unfortunately, I don't know methods to extract information from signature using PHP. So you must be able to run shell commands to use openssl</p>

<pre><code>openssl pkcs7 -in signature.pkcs7 -inform DER -print_certs &gt; info.txt
</code></pre>

<p>After running this command in file info.txt you will have a chain of certificates. Last one is the one you need. You can see the structure of the file and parse needed data.</p>

<p>All values below are changed by me to something fictional.</p>

<p>What I get is a Key <code>aHjgYFutF672eGIUGGVlgSETyM9VJj0K</code> (256-bit = 32-chars * 8-bit)
and IV: <code>rxYoks3c8hRRsL2P</code> (16-bit)</p>

<p>and (I supposed) Base64 encoded encrypted result <code>ETlAHS5ZcshKxQUaHVB8==</code></p>

<p>What I need is to decrypt in Ruby this <code>ETlAHS5ZcshKxQUaHVB8==</code> to get in the and a simple string, like 'blablablabla'</p>

<p>I tried to decrypt what I got using both Ruby and just common linux console openssl command.
NOTE: Key and IV below are not the ones used in real code:</p>

<pre><code># require 'openssl'
# require 'base64'
# decryption
aes = OpenSSL::Cipher::AES256.new(:CBC)
aes.decrypt
aes.padding = 1 # actually it's on by default
aes.key = ""aHjgYFutF672eGIUGGVlgSETyM9VJj0K""

<p>Is it possible that ruby/openssl use different PKCS, let's say PKCS#7, Java uses PKCS#5 and I need to preprocess my data ? Or there is a vesion mismatch between ruby/openssl and that Java's PKCS #7 and #5? #5 is meant for 8byte data blocks and #7 is for 16byte? Just a wild guess ...</p>
","<p>The Ruby code in my first post is correct, the problem was this <code>AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding</code> used by Java part.</p>

<p>Java program should not use this scheme for <code>AES-CBC-256</code>. <code>PKCS5</code> pads to a 64 bit (8 byte) block size, but <code>AES-256-CBC</code> uses 16 byte blocks. Therefore, <code>PKCS7</code> must be used.</p>

<p>I read all answers here more or less relevant to my issue and found <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15346009/detached-pkcs7-cms-with-strong-private-key-protection"">this</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41779669/create-a-pkcs7-signed-message-in-c-sharp-with-a-precomputed-signature"">this</a> answers. All other were helpless. The first example do exactly what I need but it relies on .NetFramework.<br>
The second one use Bouncy Castle library and do little different but similar thing. I found <a href=""https://github.com/onovotny/bc-csharp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Portable.BouncyCastle</a> project worked on  .Net Core. As I can understand it is the only option for me.</p>

<p>This is the code from the first example with some modifications:</p>

<pre><code>    string s = ""data string"";
    byte[] data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(s);        
    X509Certificate2 certificate = null;
    X509Store my = new X509Store(StoreName.My,StoreLocation.CurrentUser);
    my.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);
    certificate = my.Certificates.Find(X509FindType.FindByThumbprint, ""my thumbprint"", false)[0];
    if (certificate == null) throw new Exception(""No certificates found."");

    ContentInfo content = new ContentInfo(new Oid(""1.2.840.113549.1.7.1""),data);
    SignedCms signedCms = new SignedCms(content, true);

    CmsSigner signer = new CmsSigner(certificate);
    signer.DigestAlgorithm = new Oid(""SHA256""); 

    // create the signature
    signedCms.ComputeSignature(signer);
    return signedCms.Encode();
</code></pre>

<p>It works fine in my case.  signedCms.Encode() returns 1835 bytes and this value pass validation.</p>

<p>But if I use BounceCastle I get another result. This is the code:</p>

<pre><code>                X509Certificate2 certificate = null;
        X509Store my = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.CurrentUser);
        my.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);

        certificate = my.Certificates.Find(X509FindType.FindByThumbprint, ""my thumbprint"", false)[0];
        var privKey = DotNetUtilities.GetRsaKeyPair(certificate.GetRSAPrivateKey()).Private;
        var cert = DotNetUtilities.FromX509Certificate(certificate);

        var content = new CmsProcessableByteArray(data);

        var generator = new CmsSignedDataGenerator();

        generator.AddSigner(privKey, cert, CmsSignedGenerator.EncryptionRsa, CmsSignedGenerator.DigestSha256);

        var signedContent = generator.Generate(content, false);
        return signedContent.GetEncoded();

<p>signedContent.GetEncoded() returns 502 bytes and this result can't be validated. I understand that I'm doing wrong something but I don't know what. </p>

  <p>A byte range digest shall be computed over a range of bytes in the file, that shall be indicated by the
  ByteRange entry in the signature dictionary. This range should be the entire file, including the signature
  dictionary but excluding the signature value itself (the Contents entry).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So at this point things seem fairly simple, just digest everything except the /Contents entry in the /Sig dictionary. The actual data in the /Contents entry is specified as followed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For public-key signatures, Contents should be either a DER-encoded
  PKCS#1 binary data object or a DER-encoded PKCS#7 binary data
  object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So still no problems, I can (probably) generate the digest, reserve space for the /Contents entry and attach this PKCS#7 object later on. The confusion starts when I read the following: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Revocation information is a signed attribute, which means that the
  signing software must capture the revocation information before signing. A similar requirement applies to the
  chain of certificates. The signing software must capture and validate the certificate's chain before signing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the thing I'm not quite getting: Apparently the /Contents entry (containing the certificate and signed digest) is not digested, yet the chain of certificates is a signed attribute (and thus needs to be digested?).</p>

<p>I would appreciate it if someone could further specify exactly what is digested, and perhaps better explain the signed attributes to me. The main question that I want to answer is: Can I actually create a signable digest without knowing someone's certificate beforehand? (I'm working with a pkcs7 detached signature)</p>
","<h2>In short:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can I actually create a signable digest without knowing someone's certificate beforehand?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In case of SubFilter <strong>ETSI.CAdES.detached</strong> or <strong>adbe.pkcs7.detached</strong> you can create the <strong>document digest</strong> <em>without knowing someone's certificate beforehand</em>.</p>

<p>You usually, though, have to know the signer certificate before starting to generate the CMS signature container to embed into the PDF.</p>

<h2>In detail:</h2>

<p>(Beware, the following is somewhat simplified.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can (probably) generate the digest, reserve space for the /Contents entry and attach this PKCS#7 object later on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you <em>first reserve space</em> and <em>thereafter generate the digest</em>, this indeed is how things are done.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The main fact one has to be aware of is that in case of PKCS#7/CMS signature containers <strong>signing usually does not merely include <em>one</em> hash calculation but at least <em>two</em>!</strong></p>

<p>The first hash, the document hash, is indeed calculated for <em>the entire file, including the signature dictionary but excluding the signature value itself (the <strong>Contents</strong> entry)</em> (you might want to read <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/a/35131/16096"">this answer</a> for more details).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DkekJ.png"" alt=""Graphic sketch of hashed byte ranges""></p>

<p>But this is <strong>not</strong> the hash immediately used when applying the signature algorithm.</p>

<p>During the generation of the PKCS#7/CMS signature container (unless in its most primitive form) you create a structure called ""signed attributes"".</p>

<p>You fill this structure with multiple attributes (name-value-pairs), among them the already calculated document hash but also others, e.g. the Adobe-style revocation information you read about.</p>

<p>When you have finished creating that structure, you <em>hash this structure and generate a signature for it</em>.</p>

<p>You then can put together the PKCS#7/CMS signature container using these signed attributes, the signature, and some more information not signed by this signature, e.g. certificates, signature time stamps, ...</p>

<p>For more details concerning the signature container read <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/28429984/1729265"">this answer</a>.</p>

<p>Finally you embed this signature container into the reserved space in the PDF.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main question that I want to answer is: Can I actually create a signable digest without knowing someone's certificate beforehand? (I'm working with a pkcs7 detached signature)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In case of SubFilter <strong>ETSI.CAdES.detached</strong> or <strong>adbe.pkcs7.detached</strong> you can create the <strong>document digest</strong> <em>without knowing someone's certificate beforehand</em>.</p>

<p>Depending on the CMS signature profile, though, you usually have to know the signer certificate before starting to generate the signature container because many profiles require the presence of a signed attribute referencing the signer certificate.</p>

<h2>Clarifications:</h2>

<p>The OP asked some follow-up questions in a comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1.: One of the signed attributes is the document hash(without the /contents), so if I understand correctly this is the unsigned hash?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the ""signed attributes"" eventually are hashed and signed, that document hash therein is <strong>not immediately, directly</strong> signed <strong>but</strong> it is <strong>indirectly</strong> signed as part of this structure of attributes. So I wouldn't call it unsigned...</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""2"">
  <li>In the end when the user really generates a signature, he signs the hash of the PKCS#7 object?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>No, the hash of the ""Signed attributes"" structure which is only a part of the PKCS#7 object, not all of it. There are multiple parts of the PKCS#7/CMS object which are unsigned.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""3"">
  <li>Does the /Contents entry still have a PKCS#7 object that's actually readable for us? (To extract certificates etc for verification) </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>Contents</strong> entry does contain a full-fledged PKCS#7/CMS signature container object as a binary string. Thus, yes, you can read it (by reading the value of that binary string) and (if you have code that knows how to parse such a signature container) extract information from it.</p>

<p>Beware, though, the signature container may not contain all data required for verification: E.g., if you verify using the chain (not shell) validation model, you might have to extract the signing time from the respective PDF signature dictionary entry.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""4"">
  <li>When verifying a signature, do we simply extract the embedded PKCS#7 object, recalculate the digest, recalculate the digest of the PKCS#7 object and verify this against the signature using the certificate we get from the PKCS#7 object?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>You obviously also have to calculate the digest of the signed PDF byte ranges and compare that value with the signed attribute containing the original document digest.(You might have meant that by <em>recalculate the digest</em>.)</p>

<p>As mentioned in the answer to 3, you might have to retrieve additional information from the PDF for use in the PKCS#7 verification.</p>

<p>Furthermore you say <em>the certificate we get from the PKCS#7 object</em> - please be aware that the PKCS#7/CMS signature container may contain multiple certificates. You have to find the correct one. The CMS SignerInfo SignerIdentifier and the ESS signed attributes shall be used for that.</p>

<p>Furthermore you also have to verify validity and trust of the signer certificate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""5"">
  <li>Is there any good documentation on what authenticated attributes there are?</li>
  </ol>

","<p>The decryptor is correctly removing the padding that was applied by the encryptor, thus the zero bytes in your output are simply the un-touched bytes in the original <code>plainData</code> array. The <code>cryptoStream.Read(...)</code> call returns an integer indicating the number of bytes that were read (<code>1</code> in this case), which you should be using to determine how many bytes in the output array are valid data.</p>

<p>I am trying to sign a JAR from a .Net executable. I have pretty much done the rest of the process but jarsigner creates a pkcs7 file with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>ContentInfo set to type Data and no content. So far, making new ContentInfo( CmsObjectIdentifiers.Data, null) just throws an exception while adding the content info to the CmsData</p></li>
<li><p>A SignerInfo is added, this SignerInfo includes a signature previously derived from the JAR's content.</p></li>
</ul>
","<p>As this question is specifically related to signing an APK / JAR file, I will answer in that context.</p>

<p>Assuming that:</p>

<p>You have performed all the following setup steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generated a valid MANIFEST.MF</li>
<li>Generated a valid CERT.SF</li>
<li>Have a valid PFX file loaded into an X509Certificate2 variable named ""cert""</li>
<li>Have the binary contents of the CERT.SF file in a byte array named ""manifestSFBytes""</li>
</ol>

<p>The following code will generate a valid detached pkcs7 signature which is effectively your CERT.RSA content:</p>

<pre><code>string OID_DATA = ""1.2.840.113549.1.7.1"";

// setup the data to sign
ContentInfo content = new ContentInfo( new Oid( OID_DATA ), manifestSFBytes );
SignedCms signedCms = new SignedCms( content, true );
CmsSigner signer = new CmsSigner( SubjectIdentifierType.IssuerAndSerialNumber, cert );

// create the signature
signedCms.ComputeSignature( signer );
byte[] data = signedCms.Encode();
</code></pre>

<p>This code relies on the System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs namespace and does not require BouncyCastle.</p>

<p>What is going on here is that the raw content (signature file binary data) is hashed and signed in one go by the ComputeSignature() call.</p>

<p>Therefore no ""null ContentInfo"" tricks are necessary i.e. the ContentInfo contains the raw data to be signed and hashed unlike the Java implementation which signs and hashes the content prior to PKCS7 generation.</p>

<p>HTH</p>

"11591089","Openssl PKCS#5/PKCS#7 padding","<p>I was wondering how openssl handles a message that is dividable by 8 bytes when using AES-128-CBC. How can openssl detect that there is no padding (PKCS#5/PKCS#7) to be removed? Especially when the message ends in a character with an ASCII code less than or equal to 8.</p>

<p>I hope my question is clear.
Thanks</p>
","<p>Well the answer is that padding is always added, even if the data can be divided by the block size. Thus a 8 byte string will be padded with 8 bytes (with ASCII code 8).</p>

"21555926","How to use openssl with a hardware encryption chip?","<p>I have a hardware that I use to generate RSA keys and signatures. I need two things:</p>

<p>1) Generate a certificate request. With the hardware I can get the public key for the certificate and do the signing part. I need the code to do the certificate generation, i.e., do the ASN.1/DER/PEM stuff.</p>

<p>2) Sign data using S/MIME. Again, I will use the hardware to do the signing part, but I need the code to do the format part: PKCS#7 to envelop both a signature and a x509 certificate resulting from the previous task.</p>

<p>So I could use openssl both to generate the CSR and the S/MIME formats, but openssl requires for such tasks a private key to sign, and as I said the signing I do it via hardware. I know there is a mechanism called ""engines"" to plug hardware functions to openssl, but it uses dynamic libraries, which are not supported on my platform (early uClinux for ARM).</p>

<p>So the question is: is there any other way I could force openssl to take an extern public key, and more importantly, to delegate the signing to my hardware? Otherwise, would you recommend another C/C++ library I could use to do this? I really don't need a cryptographic library, it would suffice with a library that knows how to generate those formats (certificate requests and S/MIME).</p>
","<p>Engines are still your way to go, as they are the only way to offload cryptographic tasks using OpenSSL away from the library itself. As far as I understand you, you can build anything but it has to be statically linked into OpenSSL because you cannot load shared libraries (or build them?). I don't actually know uClinux, so bear with me here.</p>

<p>From what I remember, loading shared library is actually done through an engine called <code>dynamic</code> and that is a special engine to support such loading. That means OpenSSL's default assumption is that you will link during compile time and the engine can be considered readily available inside OpenSSL.</p>

<p>So what you want to do is create an engine that is capable of performing crypto on existing keys and build it together <em>with</em> OpenSSL. As an example, try to build OpenSSL natively (without modification) and run <code>openssl engine</code>. It will readily show you all builtin engines (one of which is <code>dynamic</code> but there are others such as <code>chil</code> for nCipher HSMs.</p>

<p>I had a similar problem about two years ago (though I already had a working engine) where I first needed to create a CSR w/ private key and then do crypto with that (or a different) private key (actually PKCS#7 as well). My solution was to use the command line tools to generate the key and CSR and only use OpenSSL for the most important cryptographic operations, i.e. signing and decrypting (I actually only needed the RSA sign and dec functions).</p>

<p>OpenSSL is a horribly documented project and I had to read a lot of its source code to get thinks working correctly. To get your engine up and running, I suggest you read some source code of engines (among others, I worked with <code>e_capi.c</code> which I found fairly easy to understand). For the actual engine usage, you might find some of my <a href=""https://github.com/Javex/sscep/blob/develop/engine.c"" rel=""nofollow"">sscep</a> source code helpful.</p>

<p>The very nice thing about engines: Once they are initialized, they operate transparently which means you initialize an engine, load a key from it and then you are set: Passing this key to OpenSSLs crypto functions is no different than using a native key.</p>

The digital signature is created as PKCS1 since the original content is not downloaded to the client, only the contents' hash is sent to the client to conserve bandwidth.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to complete CMS container? Perhaps using AttributeTable to add muliple OID's for time stamps, etc., but that doesn't seem to work either.</p>
","<p>I found the answer after looking at this reference project <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/j4ops/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/j4ops/</a>. This guide was also a big help although it deals specifically with PDFs using iText which use BC from crypto operations: <a href=""http://itextpdf.com/book/digitalsignatures20130304.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itextpdf.com/book/digitalsignatures20130304.pdf</a>. The trick is to delegate the signing operation to an external provider (PKCS11, PKCS12, etc) by implementing a Signer interface that uses a sign(byte[] toEncrypt) method, for example. This way, the provider can be set and then just call the sign method and leave the implementation details on how to sign to the provider itself.</p>

<p>Bouncy Castle uses a CMSSignedDataGenerator class with a SignerInf internal class to build the CMS container and the signer information, respectively. So the trick is to build a SignerInf object that doesn't need the private key, as sign() operation should be delegated to the provider. The private key may not even be available particularly when using smart cards. Additionally, the information that needs to be added as signed attributes and/or unsigned attributes needs to be considered when signing the hash and when building the CMS container. So these are the basic steps to solve the problem:</p>

<pre><code>// Build the items to encrypt, objects for method parameters would be obtained previously.
byte[] toEncrypt = externalSignerInfoGenerator.getCmsBytesToSign(hash, 
            signingTime, 
            PKCSObjectIdentifiers.data, 
            x509Cert, 
            timeStampToken, 
            ocsp);
// The externalSignerInfoGenerator.getCmsBytesToSign is a method from a re implemention of the 
// SignerInf inner class from CMSSignedDataGenerator and is used to get a byte array from an 
// org.bouncycastle.asn1.ASN1EncodableVector. To build the vector one should add attributes to
// their corresponding OID's using the org.bouncycastle.asn1.pkcs.PKCSObjectIdentifiers interface,
// for example:
ASN1EncodableVector signedAttrVector = buildSignedAttributes (hash, signingTime, contentType,
x509Cert, ocspResp);
// This would call the buildSignedAttributes method to build the signed attributes vector
ASN1EncodableVector signedAttrVector = new ASN1EncodableVector();
// Add CMS attributes
signedAttrVector.add (new Attribute(CMSAttributes.contentType, new DERSet (contentType)));
signedAttrVector.add (new Attribute (CMSAttributes.signingTime, new DERSet(new Time (signingTime))));
signedAttrVector.add(new Attribute(CMSAttributes.messageDigest, new DERSet(new DEROctetString(hash))));
// Not all attributes are considered in BC's CMSAttributes interface, therefore one would have to add 
// an additional step:
signedAttrVector.add(buildOcspResponseAttribute(ocspResp));
// This method would call buildOcspResponseAttribute to add the object as a PKCSObjectIdentifier
protected Attribute buildOcspResponseAttribute (byte[] ocspResp) throws IOException, CMSException {
    return new Attribute (PKCSObjectIdentifiers.id_aa_ets_revocationRefs, 
    new DERSet(DERUtil.readDERObject(ocspResp)));
}  

// Call sign method from provider, such as PKCS11, PKCS12, etc.
byte [] signature = getSignProvider().sign(toEncrypt);
// Now build standard org.bouncycastle.cms.SignerInfoGenerator with hash, signed data 
// and certificate to add to CMS, create attached or detached signature
// create signed envelope
CMSSignedData envdata = externalCMSSignedDataGenerator.generate(false);                
byte[] enveloped = envdata.getEncoded();

","<p>foDigital signature in PKCS#7/CMS format is blob that contains your XML data + signer's x509 public key certificate (.cer file) + Digital signature. The entire blob is encoded in ASN 1.0 format(X690). There may be variations in the blob due to the absence of original data or the signer certificate, This variation is called detached signatures.</p>

<p>Digital signature is generated when you sign your xml file with the signer's private key. This signature can be verified when you send your XML file + signer's public key (as X509 .cer file)+ digital signature to the party who are interested in verifying it.</p>

<p>PFX/p12 is a container that contains both the signer's private key and public key. You get this key pair from either your government or your government approved key custodians. You will then use this PFX to perform digital signature.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a C library which will let me manipulate objects comforming to the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) and X.509 standards in the following way:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>create a X.509 Certificate Signing Request (CSR), <strike>setting the Subject Public Key Algorithm to RSAES-OAEP</strike></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>let me handle the signing part:</strong> my private key is only accessible via a PKCS #11 handle, so I need the library to give me the bytes to sign, and then <strong>let me set the CSR's ProofOfPossession field</strong> with what my crypto engine computed</p></li>
<li><p>export the complete CSR to something (DER or PEM)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>create CMS structures to hold something like SignedData( EnvelopedData( stuff )). The library could handle the actual encryption/key wrapping/signature, or it could let some other software engine do it and just allow me to set the octet strings</p></li>
<li><p>let me easily parse back the message and recover those octet strings</p>

<ul>
<li>meaning I want to open a DER/PEM file which contains this CMS message, and get the bytes for the signature, the wrapped key and the encrypted stuff, so that I can feed them to my PKCS #11 interface</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Before anyone suggests OpenSSL's libcrypto, I've looked at it (looked as in, ""<em>spent the last week trying to understand how the structures work, how the ASN.1 representation works, how I can recover the bytes I'm interested in from OpenSSL's structures...</em>""), and I have some issues with it (as of 1.0.1f):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strike>(cf 1.) I cannot set the Subject Public Key Algorithm to RSAE-OAEP. Starting from <code>demos/x509/mkreq.c</code>, and going all the way back to the deep reaches of <code>x509t.h</code>'s weird <code>#define IMPLEMENT_ASN1_ENCODE_FUNCTIONS_fname(stname, itname, fname)</code> macros, I think I can affirm that <code>X509_REQ_set_pubkey()</code> cannot handle OAEP.</strike></p></li>
<li><p>(cf 2.) Neither can the CMS part of the crypto lib, for that matter. <code>cms_RecipientInfo_ktri_encrypt()</code> calls <code>EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl()</code>, which I guess resolves to <code>crypto/rsa/rsa_pmeth.c:pkey_rsa_ctrl()</code>: when p2 is <code>EVP_PKEY_CTRL_CMS_ENCRYPT</code>, <code>p2</code> is not parsed, so RSA padding is not set (if it turns out I'm wrong and I just cannot read code correctly, please tell me).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So while I'm glad <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/950662/should-one-use-cryptographic-message-syntax-cms-for-this-task"">this guy</a> managed to make it ""work like a charm"", I cannot share his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I guess for 2. I <em>could</em> use OpenSSL to create CMS blank structures, compute the future EnvelopedData content (ie stuff encrypted with a symmetric key + symmetric key wrapped with RSA OAEP), and stuff this content into the structures, bypassing <code>CMS_encrypt()</code> completely, before encapsulating into a SignedData (I'm assuming <code>CMS_sign()</code> will handle ECDSA/SHA1). As long as I don't want to use fancy parameters for OAEP (although <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22373305/rsa-public-key-encryption-openssl"">this other guy</a> managed to patch the lib to use OAEP with SHA-256).</p>

<p>But this might end up requiring a tad too much fiddling with OpenSSL's ASN.1 API. Hence my interrogation: does anyone know of a C library to <strong>build CMS structures</strong> and <strong>feed them the octet strings</strong> computed by some other engines? <strike>Also how to build certificates which read ""THIS KEY IS MEANT TO BE USED WITH RSAES-OAEP"".</strike></p>

<p>I've looked at libksba and cryptlib and while I guess they could work, I cannot see how to use them yet (might have something to do with my eyes bleeding from staring at OpenSSL's code so much - I do not mean to say that OpenSSL's code is bad or anything, just that I've been looking at it <em>hard</em>, and the doc is slightly lacking).</p>

<p>Actually, I guess, I <em>could</em> drop the C requirement (mainly there because communicating with the crypto engine is done in PKCS #11/C). Here's what the library should be able to do:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>build a CSR</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strike>... featuring ""RSAES-OAEP"" as Subject Public Key Algorithm</strike></p></li>
<li><p>give me the bytes to sign for the Proof-of-Possession part</p></li>
<li><p>take the signature and output a complete X.509 CSR</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>parse a CMS structure</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>(SignedData) give me the bytes corresponding to the signedInfo->signature and encapsulatedContentInfo fields so that I can verify them with some other engine</p></li>
<li><p>(EnvelopedData) give me the bytes corresponding to the keyTransRecipientInfo->encryptedKey and encryptedContentInfo->encryptedContent fields so that I can unwrap/decrypt with some other engine</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>build a CMS structure</strong>, either...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>letting some external engine set the fields mentioned above, and letting me specify the algorithms</p></li>
<li><p>actually implementing the algorithms, and building the CMS from just the data (... with RSAES-OAEP for key wrapping)</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Right now I'm going with a ""all-OpenSSL"" approach, because I feel like I'm in too deep and should not start wandering somewhere else. If anybody has a better idea, I am all ears.</p>

<p><strike>As for setting that subject public key algorithm... Well, either I'll just leave regular RSA and have my application ""know"" that wrapping is RSAES-OAEP, or... I don't know.</strike> And as for signing the request... is POP all that useful anyway?
(This is not a serious question)</p>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> edited to remove the whole ""I want my certificate to read OAEP"", since I just found out about <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5756"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 5756</a> (also found an <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sci.crypt/lGchnopQKtY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">interesting discussion</a> from 2006 when this RFC was not out yet).</p>
","<p>Here's what I managed to get working so far.</p>

<h2>1. Building a CSR, signing it with some other engine</h2>

<p>I mostly followed <code>demos/x509/mqreq.c</code>, with some twists.</p>

<p>(NB: error checking, fancy modulus length/label/subject DN generation/handling has been left out for brevity and focus on actual flow).</p>

<pre><code>unsigned char* mod = NULL;
unsigned char* exp = NULL;
size_t mod_l = 0;
size_t exp_l = 0;

P11_handle h_key = P11_gen_rsa(&amp;mod, &amp;mod_l, &amp;exp, &amp;exp_l);

RSA* rsa = RSA_new();

rsa-&gt;n = BN_bin2bn(rsa_mod, rsa_mod_l, NULL);
rsa-&gt;e = BN_bin2bn(rsa_exp, rsa_exp_l, NULL);

EVP_PKEY* pkey = EVP_PKEY_new();

EVP_PKEY_assign_RSA(pkey, rsa);

X509_REQ* csr = X509_REQ_new();
X509_REQ_set_pubkey(csr, pkey);

/* Boring X509_NAME/X509_EXTENSION stuff */

X509_REQ_INFO* csr_req = csr-&gt;req_info;

unsigned char* pop_in = NULL;
size_t pop_in_l = ASN1_item_i2d((void*)csr_req, &amp;pop_in,
                                ASN1_ITEM_rptr(X509_REQ_INFO));

unsigned char* sig = NULL;
size_t sig_l = 0;

P11_make_pop(SIGN_RSA_PKCS, DIGEST_SHA256,
             pop_in, pop_in_l, &amp;sig, &amp;sig_l,
             h_key);

/* Add signature to CSR (heavily inspired from ASN1_item_sign_ctx())
 * (please don't ask about the flags) */

if (csr-&gt;signature-&gt;data != NULL) OPENSSL_free(csr-&gt;signature-&gt;data);
csr-&gt;signature-&gt;data = sig;
csr-&gt;signature-&gt;length = sig_l;
csr-&gt;signature-&gt;flags&amp;= ~(ASN1_STRING_FLAG_BITS_LEFT|0x07);
csr-&gt;signature-&gt;flags|= ASN1_STRING_FLAG_BITS_LEFT;

/* Add signature algorithm information to CSR */

int sig_algo_nid = 0;
OBJ_find_sigid_by_algs(&amp;sig_algo_nid,
                       EVP_MD_nid(EVP_sha256()), EVP_PKEY_RSA);

X509_ALGOR_set0(csr-&gt;sig_alg, OBJ_nid2obj(sig_algo_nid),
                V_ASN1_NULL, NULL));
</code></pre>

<p>After that, the X509_REQ structure is good for PEM export. <code>openssl req -verify</code> seems to validate the process, so as far as I'm concerned this works.</p>

<h2>2. Building nested CMS structures (as in SignedData(EnvelopedData(Data)))</h2>

<p>Finally got it, using 1.0.2 (any previous version would have needed patching or ASN.1-level parsing). Many thanks to Dr. Stephen Henson and Tom Francis for helping me with this via the mailing list.</p>

<pre><code>/* Make EnvelopedData structure */

/* NB: oaep_label must be heap-allocated, and will be freed by OSSL */

CMS_final(edata, in, NULL, flags);

BIO* tmp = BIO_new(BIO_s_mem());
i2d_CMS_bio(tmp, edata);

/* Make SignedData structure */

flags|= CMS_NOSMIMECAP | CMS_NOCERTS;
flags&amp;= ~(CMS_KEY_PARAM);

CMS_final(sdata, tmp, NULL, flags);

BIO* out = BIO_new_file(out_path, ""wb"");
i2d_CMS_bio(out, sdata);
BIO_flush(out);
</code></pre>

<h2>3. Parsing the structure and getting the fields I need.</h2>

<p>I basically wrote my own CMS parser. ASN.1 is actually simple to parse when you know the spec. I've tried compiling the ASN.1 modules in the RFC using some ""ASN.1 to C structs"" compilers but had no luck (they kept choking on the syntax).</p>

Documents are being signed correctly, and can be verified with external tools. However, due to some legal restrictions in order to store this document in an official documentary repository I have to provide the hash/digest message from the signature.</p>

<p>I have tried almost anything to get to that hash, but the closest that I can get is to obtain the whole signature (CERT+HASH/DIGEST+TIMESTAMP) as a string with this code snippet (forgive the strings and [1] since I'm just testing how to do it):</p>

<pre><code>    PdfReader reader = new PdfReader(path);
    File temp = TempFileManager.createTempFile(""aasd2sd"", ""asdasda222cff"");

<p>With that I get a DER-enconded PKCS7 Signature, as far as I know. But, I don't know how to decode/read this info in order to get to the hast.</p>

<p>Any idea?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Cris.</p>
","<p>First of all, there is not necessarily <strong><em>the</strong> hash/digest message from the signature</em>, in case of PKCS#7 / CMS signatures usually multiple hashes are involved, cf. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/28429984/1729265"">this answer to <em>Message digest of pdf in digital signature</em></a>.</p>

<p>Considering that you need the digest to fulfill some <em>legal restrictions</em>, though, I assume you are after the value of the signed attribute <code>MessageDigest</code> which (if it is present) for <strong>ETSI.CAdES.detached</strong> or <strong>adbe.pkcs7.detached</strong> type PDF signatures is the digest of the signed byte ranges.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you want to do that using iText classes (i.e. <em>not</em> security provider classes), you have to overcome the small issue that the value you are after is stored in a private member (<code>PdfPKCS7.digestAttr</code>). Some reflection allows you to access it, though:</p>

<pre><code>void extractHashes(PdfReader reader) throws Exception
{
    AcroFields acroFields = reader.getAcroFields();
    List&lt;String&gt; names = acroFields.getSignatureNames();

    for (String name: names)
    {
        PdfPKCS7 pdfPkcs7 = acroFields.verifySignature(name);
        pdfPkcs7.verify();

        Field digestAttrField = PdfPKCS7.class.getDeclaredField(""digestAttr"");
        digestAttrField.setAccessible(true);
        byte[] digestAttr = (byte[]) digestAttrField.get(pdfPkcs7);

        // process the digest value in digestAttr 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can find the method used in a more complete example <a href=""https://github.com/mkl-public/testarea-itext5/blob/master/src/test/java/mkl/testarea/itext5/signature/ExtractHash.java"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ExtractHash.java</a> which outputs gigest algorithm and digest value of signature fields in a PDF document, e.g.:</p>

mystore = OpenSSL::X509::Store.new

<p>It also works. However, if I run the following:</p>

<pre><code>openssl smime -verify -in my_data_file -noverify

<p>Which is the same command, but without specifying the inform parameter, it fails with the same error message specified before, regarding the ""no content type"", which makes it seem I need to specify the input file format. Any ideas how I can do that through PHP?</p>

But could not find the resource to generate PCKS7 Formatted Signature using IPHONE IOS SDK.</p>

<p>I need to sign a simple text message.</p>

<p>Which library I have to use?</p>

<p>Can we use openssl for this? if yes? then how to include it in the XCODE library framework?</p>

<p>Pls help out.</p>
","<p>Yes you can use openssl for this, however you will need to compile it yourself and link your App against the static library.  If you want to run it in both the iPhone Simulator and a real iPhone Device (you do), you'll need to create a 'fat' library containing both armv7 and i386 architecture code.  If you want to support iPhone 3 instead then you'll need to include armv6 architecture code.  It's best therefore to build the library with all 3 architectures.</p>

<p>Here's a couple of resources that describe how to build openssl for iOS:</p>

<p><a href=""http://atastypixel.com/blog/easy-inclusion-of-openssl-into-iphone-app-projects/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://atastypixel.com/blog/easy-inclusion-of-openssl-into-iphone-app-projects/</a>
<a href=""https://github.com/st3fan/ios-openssl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/st3fan/ios-openssl</a></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  I actually modified st3fan's build script, which I have pasted here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/94RaeqX6"" rel=""nofollow"">setenv.sh</a> and <a href=""http://pastebin.com/fxEnLzZe"" rel=""nofollow"">build_openssl.sh</a></p>

<p>Download these scripts and keep them somewhere like ~/bin (review them and then <code>chmod</code> them 0755 once you are sure they are not malicious).</p>

<p>Next edit <code>setenv.sh</code> as it assumes there is a directory where you will install your 3rd-party libraries.  By default this is <code>/opt/local/ioslibs</code> so make sure that exists and is owned by you else the final bit will fail.  It's been configured for Xcode 4.2/iOS SDK 5 using the default locations so that might need correcting too.</p>

<p><code>build_openssl.sh</code> is configured to build a specific version of openssl (1.0.0e) and will download the source tarball if it's not in the current directory (you need <code>wget</code> for that, but if you cannot be bothered to install <code>wget</code> then manually download it using the link within the script).  When you run it, it will build the library in armv6, armv7 and i386 arch's and copy the correct files to the installation directory.</p>

"17844519","Convert PKCS7 to PKCS12 using java.security.KeyStore","<p>When I try to import a renewed X509 certificate on Chrome / Firefox (and probably other browser), it does not recognize that the certificate I am trying to import uses the same private key stored in my expiring user certificate with the same DN. I don't know if this is a bug with the implementation of certificate import tool of all major browsers, but I can (somewhat) work around this problem by storing my user certificate inside a private key-less PKCS12 file using openssl tool like following.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>openssl pkcs12 -export -in usercert.pem -nokeys -name ""CN: Same Name"" -out certonly.p12
  (-nokeys is the trick here)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't know why this works, but I can then import certonly.p12 to Chrome / Firefox and it will attach my private key from the last year; although it creates a separate certificate entry so that I need to remove my old certificate manually. </p>

<p>So, I assume that, in order to renew my user certificate on my browser, I will need to package my certificate in PKCS12 format (with or without a pass-phrase).</p>

<p>Now, I need to do this in my Java application using java.security.KeyStore or similar libraries, because it is actually my web application which is generating user's renewed certificates. I don't want to ask our users to use the openssl command themselve to convert it to pkcs12 before importing to their browsers. My application should do this automatically, and provide them the renewed certificate contained inside a PKCS12 file.</p>

<p>I've looked many places, but so far I can't find a concrete example of how to do this using Java. Does anyone know how to output a pass-phrase less PKCS12 with only an issued certificate (or pkcs7) without a private key?</p>

<p>I tried something like following but it did not work.</p>

<pre><code>java.security.cert.Certificate[] chain  = CertificateManager.parsePKCS7(renewed_cert_in_pkcs7);
KeyStore p12 = KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS12"");

<p>Mono provides classes, inside <a href=""https://github.com/mono/mono/tree/master/mcs/class/Mono.Security"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Mono.Security</code></a>, to read them. They are very low-level API (with some helpers) so, in theory, they should be able to read anything... as long as you don't mind coding the processing your format itself.</p>

<p>Other libraries, <a href=""http://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/"" rel=""nofollow"">BouncyCastle</a> comes to mind, will offer similar (low or high level) API to process PKCS#7 files.</p>

<p>The AC responds well.
How I can do this with BouncyCastle and cer and key files? I am going crazy! :-(</p>
","<p>Unfortunately there seems to be <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13667828/c-sharp-resoursces-for-bouncy-castle-api"">no bouncycastle API documentation for C#</a>. Never the less there's a <a href=""https://www.bouncycastle.org/docs/pkixdocs1.4/org/bouncycastle/cms/CMSSignedData.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Java reference</a> which is said to be quite similar to the C# API.</p>

<p>Hence the <code>getEncoded()</code>-method (look for a C# equivalent, e.g. <code>GetEncoded()</code>) yields a ASN.1 encoded <code>byte[]</code>.</p>

<p>You could then go ahead and get a string from that (note that I'm not familiar with ASN.1 encoding. This is just a guess 😉):</p>

<pre><code>byte[] buffer = datosFirmados.GetEncoded();

<p><strong>Problem:: X509_verify_cert is returning Zero(0)</strong>. Any advises?</p>
","<p>X509_verify_cert returns success only for valid certificates chains i.e. each next certificate has to be signed by previous one (except 1st that has to be self-signed). To determine whether you have a valid chain full information about your pems should be provided. But considering your comments I see that CA.pem doesn't sign mid1.pem because CA.pem's subject (Verisign Inc) is not equal to mid1.pem's issuer (Thawte)</p>

<p>EDIT: I have the public key.</p>

<p>Here is the mime info:-</p>

<pre><code>Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type=enveloped-data;\r\n\tname=""Message.p7m""\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: BASE64\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=""Message.p7m""
</code></pre>
","<p>The P7M file type is primarily associated with a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/MIME"" rel=""nofollow""><code>PKCS #7 MIME Message</code></a>. See <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2311#section-3.2"" rel=""nofollow"">Section 3.2 in RFC 2311</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>3.2 The application/pkcs7-mime Type

    The application/pkcs7-mime type is used to carry PKCS #7 objects of
    several types including envelopedData and signedData. The details of
    constructing these entities is described in subsequent sections. This
    section describes the general characteristics of the
    application/pkcs7-mime type.

    This MIME type always carries a single PKCS #7 object. The PKCS #7
    object must always be BER encoding of the ASN.1 syntax describing the
    object. The contentInfo field of the carried PKCS #7 object always
    contains a MIME entity that is prepared as described in section 3.1.
    The contentInfo field must never be empty.

    Since PKCS #7 objects are binary data, in most cases base-64 transfer
    encoding is appropriate, in particular when used with SMTP transport.
    The transfer encoding used depends on the transport through which the
    object is to be sent, and is not a characteristic of the MIME type.

    Note that this discussion refers to the transfer encoding of the PKCS
    \#7 object or ""outside"" MIME entity. It is completely distinct from,
    and unrelated to, the transfer encoding of the MIME entity secured by
    the PKCS #7 object, the ""inside"" object, which is described in
    section 3.1.

    Because there are several types of application/pkcs7-mime objects, a
    sending agent SHOULD do as much as possible to help a receiving agent
    know about the contents of the object without forcing the receiving
    agent to decode the ASN.1 for the object. The MIME headers of all
    application/pkcs7-mime objects SHOULD include the optional ""smime-
    type"" parameter, as described in the following sections.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This is basically a secure E-mail file sent in encrypted form. If everything is set up properly you should have a public key necessary to decrypt the file. If not, download it.</p>

<p>In your case the transfer encoding is Base64. Decode the attachment first (if you don't have done this so far) and then process the binary data.</p>

Given that, i am trying to figure out, if instead of signing the PDF file, is it possible to just sign the Hash (ex SHA1) of that file and than the client puts it all together in the end?</p>

<p>The problem is that Adobe says the signature is invalid because the ""document has been altered or corrupted since it was signed"".
Can anyone help?</p>
","<p>In his update the OP nearly has it right, there merely are two errors:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He tries to read the <code>InputStream</code> parameter content twice:</p>

<pre><code>CMSTypedData msg = new CMSProcessableByteArray(IOUtils.toByteArray(content));
[...]
Attribute attr = new Attribute(CMSAttributes.messageDigest,
        new DERSet(new DEROctetString(md.digest(IOUtils.toByteArray(content)))));
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, all data had already been read from the stream before the second attempt which consequently returned an empty <code>byte[]</code>. So the message digest attribute contained a wrong hash value.</p></li>
<li><p>He creates the final CMS container in a convoluted way:</p>

<pre><code>return new CMSSignedData(msg, s.getEncoded()).getEncoded();
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Reducing the latter to what is actually needed, it turns out that there is no need for the <code>CMSTypedData msg</code> anymore. Thus, the former is implicitly resolved.</p>

<p>After re-arranging the digest calculation to the top of the method and additionally switching to SHA256 (as SHA1 is deprecated in many contexts, I prefer to use a different hash algorithm) and allowing for a certificate <code>chain</code> instead of a single <code>certificate</code>, the method looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Digest generation step

<hr>

<p>One remark:</p>

<p>The OP used <code>IOUtils.toByteArray(content))</code> (and so do I in the code above). But considering the OP's starting remark</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>what if the PDF file is too big to be uploaded? ex: 100mb </p>
</blockquote>

<p>doing so is not such a great idea as it loads a big file into memory at once only for hashing. If one really wants to consider the resource footprint of one's application, one should read the stream a few KB at a time and consecutively digest the data using <code>MessageDigest.update</code> and only use <code>MessageDigest.digest</code> at the end to get the result hash value.</p>

"39507483","Signing a PDF with adbe.pkcs7.detached","<p>I have a PDF generator written in C, and now I want to add digital signatures to it. I started with a minimal PDF, signed it with <a href=""http://jsignpdf.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">JSignPdf</a>, and am now trying to get my own program to produce a file that Adobe Acrobat Reader will interpret identically. I've checked the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/378247/digitally-sign-pdf-files"">Digitally sign PDF files</a> question, but the comments there seemed to conclude that one should use iText instead of trying to do it yourself. I don't want that.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em>
I have indeed also read both the PDF Reference for 1.7 and the ""32000"" specification linked below, but sometimes I get a bit lost by the number of references. Starting with a working example is often the easiest way for me to understand how everything fits together. Sorry for not making this clear in my initial post.</p>

<p>I've gotten Acrobat Reader to acknowledge that there is a signature in the file, but something is still wrong. In the Signature Panel it says ""Signed by Unknown"" instead of using the correct name from the key. When opening ""Signature Properties"" it says ""This signature is invalid because there are errors in the formatting or information contained in this signature"". On the ""Advanced Signature Properties"", the Hash Algorithm is ""Not available"".</p>

<p>The PDF from JSignPdf is correct, according to Acrobat Reader. After telling it to accept my self signed certificate, it displays a nice green checkbox for the signature. To find the minimal additions needed, I've cleared one PDF tag after another, carefully not changing the offset for the remaining tags. This gives the same ""This signature is invalid..."" error message as above, but it still shows ""The signer's identity is valid"", as well as showing the Hash Algorithm as ""SHA1"".</p>

<p>The question is what the reason is for this difference, and if there are any tools that can give a more detailed explanation of what is wrong?</p>

<p>In the /Type/Catalog dictionary, I have an /AcroForm. I've tried putting it both in place and as a reference, but that makes no difference. The /AcroForm contains /SigFlags 3 and /Fields [ x 0 R ], where x is the id of a /Type/Annot with /Subtype/Widget. (The ""endobj"" is moved to the "">>"" line to save some space here.)</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> There are some dictionaries, even though I don't remember their name right now, where the ""in place"" vs ""reference"" is significant. Especially the implementation notes in the 1.7 spec has a few of these, as well as a few ""the spec says this field is optional, but actually it's required"".</p>

<pre><code>2 0 obj &lt;&lt;
 /Type /Catalog
 /Pages 3 0 R
 /AcroForm &lt;&lt;
  /Fields [ 8 0 R ]
  /SigFlags 3
  &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; endobj
</code></pre>

<p>In the /Type/Page object, I have /Annots [ x 0 R ], which seemed to be required to get Acrobat Reader to accept that there was any signature here at all.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> With a working signature, things change a bit. Without this reference, Acrobat Reader does indeed say the signature is valid, but doesn't show any details about it. With it, the ""Signature Properties"" menu item is enabled again.</p>

<pre><code>4 0 obj &lt;&lt;

<p>The /Annot dictionary contains /T(Signature1), /FT/Sig, /Rect[0 0 0 0], and /V y 0 R, where y is a /Type/Sig object. The JSignPdf version also contains ""/F 132"" and ""/P 4 0 R"", but I can't find them in the <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">PDF Specification</a>. They don't seem to be required anyway.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Ah, I had missed the link from section 12.7.1 to 12.5.2.</p>

<pre><code>8 0 obj &lt;&lt;

 /T(Signature1)
 /V 7 0 R

<p>The /Type/Sig object contains /Filter/Adobe.PPKLite, /SubFilter/adbe.pkcs7.detached, /M(D:20160907094326+02'00'), a /ByteRange array and a /Contents string.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> I'm using this combination as it was recommended for PDF/A.</p>

<pre><code>7 0 obj &lt;&lt;
 /Contents &lt;3082031f...&gt;

<p>The /ByteArray has for values: 0, offset-of-last-byte-before-""&lt;""-in-Contents, offset-of-first-byte-after-"">"", and the length of the remainder of the file. If I take the file from JSignPdf, run this (where buf contains the file data):</p>

<pre><code>SHA1_Init(ctx);
SHA1_Update(ctx, buf + offset1, len1);
SHA1_Update(ctx, buf + offset2, len2);
SHA1_Final(digest, ctx);
</code></pre>

<p>I get the exact same data as in the PKCS7 data for the "":messageDigest"" tag. The same is true for my own file. So, I trust those values to be correct.</p>

<p>Using the same cert and key I get the exact same PKCS7 data, except of course the messageDigest and rsaEncryption hex dumps. However, copying the JSignPdf PKCS7 data to my file (as they are exactly the same length) doesn't work, it still complains about not finding the Hash Algorithm. My PKCS7 data in the JSignPdf works, but of course gives the wrong checksum. So, everything OpenSSL-related is most likely correct, the problem must be in the PDF tags somewhere. Is there a reference I've missed, or some tag or object ordering that must be followed?</p>

<p><strong>Solved:</strong> The only remaining thing to play with at this point was the values for the ByteRange tag. The first length was actually ok. However, the second offset was off by one in the implementation, being 1 too small. Adjusting this, I got a green checkbox for the signature!</p>

<p>The PDF specification is ISO 32000-1 (part 2 is under construction), and you can download a free copy with a very few changes (making clear that this is not the ISO copy) on Adobe's web site:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf</a></p>

<p>(In the middle of your question text you show that you do know that this document exists but you also show that you have not properly studied it.)</p>

<p>For a first overview on integrated PDF signatures, have a look at <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/a/35131/16096"">this answer</a> on Information Security Stack Exchange.</p>

<h3>In detail,</h3>

<p>that been said, let's look at your problems and point you to some appropriate section of the specification:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the /Type/Catalog dictionary, I have an /AcroForm. I've tried putting it both in place and as a reference, but that makes no difference. The /AcroForm contains /SigFlags 3 and /Fields [ x 0 R ], where x is the id of a /Type/Annot with /Subtype/Widget. (The ""endobj"" is moved to the "">>"" line to save some space here.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The document catalog is specified in section 7.7.2.</p>

<p>The <strong>AcroForm</strong> dictionary there is specified as</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>AcroForm</strong> dictionary <em>(Optional; PDF 1.2)</em> The document’s <em>interactive form (AcroForm) dictionary</em> (see 12.7.2, ""Interactive Form Dictionary"").</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>In particular it does not specify whether it is to be a direct object or not. Thus, <em>""that makes no difference""</em> indeed.</p>

<p>The interactive form dictionary is specified in section 12.7.2.</p>

<p>In particular,</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>SigFlags</strong> integer <em>(Optional; PDF 1.3)</em> A set of flags specifying various document-level characteristics related to signature fields (see Table 219, and 12.7.4.5, “Signature Fields”). Default value: 0.</p>
    
    <p>...</p>
    
    <p>1 ""SignaturesExist"" If set, the document contains at least one signature field. This flag allows a conforming reader to enable user interface items (such as menu items or pushbuttons) related to signature processing without having to scan the entire document for the presence of signature fields.</p>
    
    <p>2 ""AppendOnly"" If set, the document contains signatures that may be invalidated if the file is saved (written) in a way that alters its previous contents, as opposed to an incremental update. Merely updating the file by appending new information to the end of the previous version is safe (see H.7, “Updating Example”). Conforming readers may use this flag to inform a user requesting a full save that signatures will be invalidated and require explicit confirmation before continuing with the operation.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Fields</strong> array <em>(Required)</em> An array of references to the document’s root fields(those with no ancestors in the field hierarchy).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>and the whole section 12.7 describing interactive forms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the /Type/Page object, I have /Annots [ x 0 R ], which seemed to be required to get Acrobat Reader to accept that there was any signature here at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Section 12.5 describes annotations.</p>

<p>A signature field is a form field. Form fields can have visualizations on some pages. Such visualizations are <strong>Widget</strong> annotations. If a form field has only one widget annotation, the form field object and the widget object may be merged into a single object.</p>

<p>All the annotations on some page are referenced from the page's <strong>Annots</strong> array.</p>

<p>But no, you can have invisible signatures (they do appear in the Adobe Reader signature panel, merely not in the document) which do not require an annotation referenced from a page.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The /Annot dictionary contains /T(Signature1), /FT/Sig, /Rect[0 0 0 0], and /V y 0 R, where y is a /Type/Sig object. The JSignPdf version also contains ""/F 132"" and ""/P 4 0 R"", but I can't find them in the PDF Specification. They don't seem to be required anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah, so you do know the specification. Please use it!</p>

<p><strong>T</strong>, <strong>FT</strong>, and <strong>V</strong> are form field entries, cf. section 12.7.3.</p>

<p><strong>Rect</strong>, <strong>Type</strong>, <strong>F</strong>, and <strong>P</strong> are annotation entries, cf. section 12.5.2.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The /Type/Sig object contains /Filter/Adobe.PPKLite, /SubFilter/adbe.pkcs7.detached, /M(D:20160907094326+02'00'), a /ByteRange array and a /Contents string.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of these entries are specified ion section 12.8.1 and more extensively in the remainder of 12.8.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The /ByteArray has for values: 0, offset-of-last-byte-before-""&lt;""-in-Contents, offset-of-first-byte-after-"">"", and the length of the remainder of the file.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is specified as</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>ByteRange</strong> array <em>(Required for all signatures that are part of a signature field and usage rights signatures referenced from the UR3 entry in the permissions dictionary)</em> An array of pairs of integers (starting byte offset, length in bytes) that shall describe the exact byte range for the digest calculation. Multiple discontiguous byte ranges shall be used to describe a digest that does not include the signature value (theContents entry) itself.</p>
    
    <p>..</p>
    
    <p>This range should be the entire file, including the signature dictionary but excluding the signature value itself (the <strong>Contents</strong> entry).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>(Even though this merely is a recommendation, signatures not following this recommendation usually are not accepted.)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Your <em>offset-of-last-byte-before-""&lt;""-in-Contents</em> seems odd, it should be the offset of the ""&lt;"", i.e. the length of the part before the ""&lt;"".</strong></p>

<p>Aside from that you seem to have correctly recognized the values in question. If this is not the cause of your problem, therefore, I assume there are still other problems in your PDF or the signature container you inject. Please share the files in question (e.g. via a public dropbox or google drive share) for further analysis.</p>

<hr>

<p>This all being said, depending on the use case you develop your signing code for you probably should look into PAdES style signatures instead of the good ol'fashioned ones.</p>

"39507483","Signing a PDF with adbe.pkcs7.detached","<p>I have a PDF generator written in C, and now I want to add digital signatures to it. I started with a minimal PDF, signed it with <a href=""http://jsignpdf.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">JSignPdf</a>, and am now trying to get my own program to produce a file that Adobe Acrobat Reader will interpret identically. I've checked the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/378247/digitally-sign-pdf-files"">Digitally sign PDF files</a> question, but the comments there seemed to conclude that one should use iText instead of trying to do it yourself. I don't want that.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em>
I have indeed also read both the PDF Reference for 1.7 and the ""32000"" specification linked below, but sometimes I get a bit lost by the number of references. Starting with a working example is often the easiest way for me to understand how everything fits together. Sorry for not making this clear in my initial post.</p>

<p>I've gotten Acrobat Reader to acknowledge that there is a signature in the file, but something is still wrong. In the Signature Panel it says ""Signed by Unknown"" instead of using the correct name from the key. When opening ""Signature Properties"" it says ""This signature is invalid because there are errors in the formatting or information contained in this signature"". On the ""Advanced Signature Properties"", the Hash Algorithm is ""Not available"".</p>

<p>The PDF from JSignPdf is correct, according to Acrobat Reader. After telling it to accept my self signed certificate, it displays a nice green checkbox for the signature. To find the minimal additions needed, I've cleared one PDF tag after another, carefully not changing the offset for the remaining tags. This gives the same ""This signature is invalid..."" error message as above, but it still shows ""The signer's identity is valid"", as well as showing the Hash Algorithm as ""SHA1"".</p>

<p>The question is what the reason is for this difference, and if there are any tools that can give a more detailed explanation of what is wrong?</p>

<p>In the /Type/Catalog dictionary, I have an /AcroForm. I've tried putting it both in place and as a reference, but that makes no difference. The /AcroForm contains /SigFlags 3 and /Fields [ x 0 R ], where x is the id of a /Type/Annot with /Subtype/Widget. (The ""endobj"" is moved to the "">>"" line to save some space here.)</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> There are some dictionaries, even though I don't remember their name right now, where the ""in place"" vs ""reference"" is significant. Especially the implementation notes in the 1.7 spec has a few of these, as well as a few ""the spec says this field is optional, but actually it's required"".</p>

<pre><code>2 0 obj &lt;&lt;
 /Type /Catalog
 /Pages 3 0 R
 /AcroForm &lt;&lt;
  /Fields [ 8 0 R ]
  /SigFlags 3
  &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; endobj
</code></pre>

<p>In the /Type/Page object, I have /Annots [ x 0 R ], which seemed to be required to get Acrobat Reader to accept that there was any signature here at all.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> With a working signature, things change a bit. Without this reference, Acrobat Reader does indeed say the signature is valid, but doesn't show any details about it. With it, the ""Signature Properties"" menu item is enabled again.</p>

<pre><code>4 0 obj &lt;&lt;

<p><em>Update:</em> I'm using this combination as it was recommended for PDF/A.</p>

<pre><code>7 0 obj &lt;&lt;

<p>The /ByteArray has for values: 0, offset-of-last-byte-before-""&lt;""-in-Contents, offset-of-first-byte-after-"">"", and the length of the remainder of the file. If I take the file from JSignPdf, run this (where buf contains the file data):</p>

<pre><code>SHA1_Init(ctx);
SHA1_Update(ctx, buf + offset1, len1);
SHA1_Update(ctx, buf + offset2, len2);
SHA1_Final(digest, ctx);
</code></pre>

<p>I get the exact same data as in the PKCS7 data for the "":messageDigest"" tag. The same is true for my own file. So, I trust those values to be correct.</p>

<p>Using the same cert and key I get the exact same PKCS7 data, except of course the messageDigest and rsaEncryption hex dumps. However, copying the JSignPdf PKCS7 data to my file (as they are exactly the same length) doesn't work, it still complains about not finding the Hash Algorithm. My PKCS7 data in the JSignPdf works, but of course gives the wrong checksum. So, everything OpenSSL-related is most likely correct, the problem must be in the PDF tags somewhere. Is there a reference I've missed, or some tag or object ordering that must be followed?</p>

<p><strong>Solved:</strong> The only remaining thing to play with at this point was the values for the ByteRange tag. The first length was actually ok. However, the second offset was off by one in the implementation, being 1 too small. Adjusting this, I got a green checkbox for the signature!</p>
","<p>A certificate is always certified by a certification authority. So, a certificate is signed by an authority. To check a certificate, means to verify this signature and so you need the authority certificate witch must be avalable to process in some root CA.
Your signing pdf certifiacte is self certified. You need to put your self-signed certificate in root CA hive in your cert keystore.</p>

"33512409","Automate export x509 certificate w/chain from Server 2008 R2 to a p7b file WITHOUT external tools?","<p>I manage the Domain Controllers centrally, but the site admins manage their own digital senders locally. I can easily export an X509 certificate (private key not needed) with the whole chain from a Windows Server 2008 R2 Domain Controller to a p7b file through the wizard:</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>...5. The Certificate Export Wizard opens. Click Next.</p>

<ol start=""6"">
<li><p>In the Export File Format dialog box, do the following:</p>

<p>a. Select Cryptographic Message Syntax Standard – PKCS #7 Certificates (.P7B).</p>

<p>b. Check Include all certificates in the certification path if possible.</p>

<p>c. Click Next.</p></li>
<li><p>In the File to Export dialog box, click Browse.</p></li>

<p>c. Click Save.</p></li>
<li><p>In the File to Export dialog box, click Next.</p></li>
<li><p>On the Completing the Certificate Export Wizard page, click Finish.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>It works great. The resulting file imports just fine into a digital sender for authentication. It gives the site admins access to the other certs in the chain if they have not already imported them. It does not need to contain the private key, since it works fine without it. </p>

<p>The trouble is, I would need to do this manually, literally dozens of times, once for each business site, since each has their own Domain Controllers, each with their own certificate. There must be a way I can automate this certificate export (PowerShell w/.NET, certutil.exe, etc.). Maybe something that uses System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates X509IncludeOption with WholeChain, but I can't get it to work: </p>

<p>$Cert = (dir Cert:\localmachine\my)[0]</p>

<p>Set-Content -path $My_Export_Path -Value $Exported_pkcs7 -encoding Byte</p>

<p>With this code, I only get the certificate, not the rest of the certificates in its chain. I don't need the whole script, just the part that duplicates the export w/chain that I can already do manually through the GUI. </p>

","<p>That's probably a signature or an encrypted piece of data. It's old name is PKCS-7 (of RSA labs, publicly available standard) but it is also known as CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax, publicly available RFC). CMS is a container format for different kinds of encryption. You can parse it in Java using the open source Bouncy Castle libraries - ""bcmail"" in particular, but you probably need some kind of key if it is encrypted. If it is signed, you could simply parse the plain text data from it and ignore the signature, I guess, depends on the application really.</p>

<p>I've searched net, but most examples are related to signing email chunks and use M2Crypto. Is there any way of doing it in bare PyOpenSSL?</p>
","<p>The PKCS#7 OpenSSL functions that you need for this do not seem to be exported by the Python OpenSSL wrapper. You could try to do this via the internals of the crypto module, for example like the following snippet:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; with open('cleg.p12', 'r') as f:
...   p12data=f.read()
&gt;&gt;&gt; p12=crypto.load_pkcs12(p12data,'passphrase')

&gt;&gt;&gt; pkey=p12.get_privatekey()
&gt;&gt;&gt; bio_in=crypto._new_mem_buf(manifest)
&gt;&gt;&gt; PKCS7_DETACHED=0x40
&gt;&gt;&gt; pkcs7=crypto._lib.PKCS7_sign(signcert._x509, pkey._pkey, crypto._ffi.NULL, bio_in, PKCS7_DETACHED)

1
&gt;&gt;&gt; sigbytes=crypto._bio_to_string(bio_out)
</code></pre>

<p>After this, <code>sigbytes</code> contains the signature, ASN.1 DER encoded. The constant value for <code>PKCS7_DETACHED</code> is defined in the <code>pkcs7.h</code> header file in OpenSSL.</p>

<p>As you probably know, any identifiers that start with <code>_</code> are internal to the <code>crypto</code> module and are not supposed to be used by you directly. Therefore, this answer is just for illustration purposes. A proper solution (with correct memory management) should be added to the <code>crypto</code> module itself.</p>

<p>I also have a private key loaded from a certificate.</p>

<p>Is there a way after decrypting the <code>EnvelopedCms.RecipientInfos[0].EncryptedKey</code> (with the private key) to use the session key in a managed decryption algorithm to decrypt the <code>EnvelopedCms.ContentInfo.Content</code> ?</p>

<p>P.S: I don't want to use <code>EnvelopedCms.Decrypt()</code>, I know it exists, but I don't want to use it.</p>
","<p>It is easy to check for the <code>EnvelopedCms.ContentEncryptionAlgorithm.Oid.FriendlyName</code> property to know which algorithm was used to encrypt the content. The encryption algorithm is chosen by the Outlook user from (Options -> Trust Center -> Trust Center Settings -> Email Security -> Encrypted Email -> Default Settings). Since the encryption algorithm is typically a symmetric algorithm, the KeySize, BlockSize, SymmetricKey, and Initial Vector are usually needed. The value for BlockSize is known from the algorithm. The KeySize could either be known from the name of the algorithm (e.g. AES256 means the KeySize is 256) or by checking the value of <code>EnvelopedCms.ContentEncryptionAlgorithm.KeyLength</code>. The SymmetricKey is given by assumption. The Initial Vector is found in <code>EnvelopedCms.ContentEncryptionAlgorithm.Parameters</code>.</p>

<p>However, you have to watch for the padding of the content or a ""Length of data is invalid"" exception is thrown. Therefore, there's a padding of 6 characters which must be trimmed before attempting to decrypt using the symmetric cipher, <strong>however, I don't have an authoritative resource why these 6 zero-characters exist and whether is it safe to assume that they are always to be trimmed.</strong></p>

<p>For the RC2-64 algorithm, the KeyLength property returns 0, therefore make sure to set the KeySize property to 64 before invoking the cipher.</p>

However, I couldn't find way to do it with already signed data and with no access to primary key (as it is on smartcard a CANNOT be exported). So i tried it with native java libraries like this:</p>

<pre><code>X500Name xName = X500Name.asX500Name(cert.getSubjectX500Principal());
BigInteger serial   = cert.getSerialNumber();
AlgorithmId digestAlgorithmId = new AlgorithmId(AlgorithmId.SHA512_oid);
AlgorithmId signAlgorithmId = new AlgorithmId(AlgorithmId.RSAEncryption_oid);

//SignerInfo
SignerInfo sInfo = new SignerInfo(xName, serial, digestAlgorithmId, signAlgorithmId, signatureBytes);
//Create ContentInfo
ContentInfo cInfo = new ContentInfo(ContentInfo.DATA_OID, new DerValue(DerValue.tag_OctetString, dataToSign));
//create PKCS7 signature
PKCS7 p7 = new PKCS7(new AlgorithmId[] { digestAlgorithmId }, cInfo,
        new java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] { cert },
        new SignerInfo[] { sInfo });
//Write PKCS7 to bYteArray
ByteArrayOutputStream bOut = new DerOutputStream();
p7.encodeSignedData(bOut);
byte[] encodedPKCS7 = bOut.toByteArray();
</code></pre>

<p>This approach seems ""not right"" to me to be honest and I was not even able to verify it using PKCS7.verify() method (it returns null, which is unsuccessfull verification and no exceptions are thrown).</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Is there any way to get directly a CMS signature from JavaCard?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is it possible to create CMS signature from already generated signature only with signers certificate (without acces to private key)?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do you see any problem with ""conversion"" code above?</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Do you know any tool, that can be used to verify detached signatures? (to be able to check my outcomes)</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>A was looking for answers for 2 weeks now and I am really desperate. Thanks for ANY kind of information/help.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>(1) Is there any way to get directly a CMS signature from JavaCard?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As JavaCards are quite versatile if you are the one programming them, that just might be possible. The communication required to retrieve those CMS containers, though, would be quite proprietary, most likely only usable by your code (which can be good or bad for you; for the customer it generally is bad) and by code from people hacking your solution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) Is it possible to create CMS signature from already generated signature only with signers certificate (without acces to private key)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can create very primitive CMS signature containers if you already have PKCS#1 signatures, cf. the question <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12796545/how-can-we-convert-pkcs1-to-pkcs-7-if-i-have-the-certificate"">How can we Convert PKCS#1 to PKCS #7 if I have the Certificate</a> you refer to.</p>

<p>If you intend to be interoperable with other signature verification software, though, such primitive signatures (which have a huge potential for manipulation) most likely will be rejected.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(3) Do you see any problem with ""conversion"" code above?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please also supply sample PKCS#1 input signatures and sample CMS results. Furthermore, as @owlstead commented, <em>You should not use Sun inner classes, they may be altered, renamed or even removed without further notice.</em> (I actually would prefer to replace <em>should</em> by <em>shall</em>.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(4) Do you know any tool, that can be used to verify detached signatures? (to be able to check my outcomes)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OpenSSL contains verification tools. Furthermore there are many web services providing signature verification services. Which of them would be appropriate for you, does very much depend on the PKI and legal environment of your signatures.</p>

<p><strong>Ideas to consider</strong>:</p>

<p>I think that the cause lies in the generation of the signature but I suppose I am doing it according to docs. Or - the validation process may expect some kind of different structure like PKCS1 while the generator provides PKCS7. Nothing actually tells me what to search next.</p>

<p>Here is a piece of code which should illustrate the problem and output (after providing your own certificates and a private key):</p>

<p>I'd like to take p7m file and convert it to an smime message keping a valid signature.</p>

<p>The steps should be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>extract signed content from p7m</p></li>
<li><p>extract cms structure from p7m</p></li>
<li><p>pack everything in a new smime structure with detached signature</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Is this operation possible ?</p>

<p>I've searched through openssl manuals but I couldn't find a way to do it.</p>
","<p>I was able to convert opaque-signed messages to a detached ones with the following code:</p>

<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;openssl/evp.h&gt;
#include &lt;openssl/bio.h&gt;
#include &lt;openssl/pkcs7.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    BIO *data = NULL, *bin = NULL, *bout = NULL;
    PKCS7 *p7, *p7b;

    OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms();

    bin = BIO_new_file(""opaque.p7m"", ""rb"");
    p7 = SMIME_read_PKCS7(bin, &amp;data);
    p7b = PKCS7_dup(p7);

    data = PKCS7_dataInit(p7, NULL);

    PKCS7_set_detached(p7b, 1);

    bout = BIO_new_file(""detached.p7m"", ""wb"");
    SMIME_write_PKCS7(bout, p7b, data, PKCS7_BINARY | SMIME_DETACHED);
}
</code></pre>

<p>To test the program I generate the opaque.p7m with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ openssl smime -sign -in foo.txt -signer my.crt -inkey my.key -nodetach -out opaque.p7m
</code></pre>

<p>To be terse, the code above has no checks. To accept different input formats, you can change <code>SMIME_read_PKCS7</code> to <code>PEM_read_bio_PKCS7</code> (PEM) or <code>d2i_PKCS7_bio</code> (DER).</p>

<p>The OpenSSL source is probably a good place to start. OpenSSL provides the source for <code>smime</code> in <code>&lt;openssl dir&gt;/apps/smime.c</code>.</p>

<p>OpenSSL's <code>smime</code> utility just calls <code>PKCS7_sign</code> with the appropriate parameters. From around line 688:</p>

<pre><code>else if (operation &amp; SMIME_SIGNERS)
    {
    int i;
    /* If detached data content we only enable streaming if
     * S/MIME output format.

    if (operation == SMIME_SIGN)

            }
            else if (indef)

       encoding of the EXPLICIT SET OF tag, rather than of the IMPLICIT [0]
       tag, MUST be included in the message digest calculation along with
       the length and content octets of the SignedAttributes value.</p>

<p>accordingly before calculating the digest.</p>

<p>Have you furthermore considered that <em>result of decryption of encrypted digest</em> (I hope you are talking about old-fashioned RSA signing, otherwise <em>decryption</em> is not helpful) is <strong>not</strong> the naked digest but instead the digest wrapped in a <code>DigestInfo</code> structure?</p>

<p>Thus, here a bit of Java code using Bouncy Castle (maybe not used optimally, I'm more at home with a propriety crypto library) to calculate the hash of the signed attributes and extract the hash from the RSA signature:</p>

    byte[] derSignedAttributes = signerInformation.getEncodedSignedAttributes();
    MessageDigest sha1 = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-1"");
    byte[] derSignedAttributesHash = sha1.digest(derSignedAttributes);

    // Retrieving the public key from the (single) certificate in the container
    X509CertificateHolder cert = (X509CertificateHolder) cms.getCertificates().getMatches(new Selector() {
        public boolean match(Object arg0) { return true; }
        public Object clone()             { return this; }
    }).iterator().next();
    X509EncodedKeySpec publicKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(cert.getSubjectPublicKeyInfo().getEncoded());
    KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(publicKeySpec.getFormat());
    Key key = keyFactory.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);

    // Decrypting the DigestInfo from the RSA signature
    Cipher asymmetricCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"", ""BC"");
    asymmetricCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key);
    byte[] digestInfo = asymmetricCipher.doFinal(signerInformation.getSignature());
    DigestInfo digestInfoObject = new DigestInfo(ASN1Sequence.getInstance(digestInfo));

    System.out.println(""Signed Attributes: "" + toHex(derSignedAttributes));

It is almost what openssl function PKCS7_sign does, except the signing. Maybe somebody can advice something for this question, i.e. how to do this with openssl or any other c/c++ crossplatform library.
As for openssl, it seems flags PKCS7_PARTIAL or PKCS7_STREAM of PKCS7_sign function can be usefull. If i use any of this flags i can get almost full PKCS7 structure. In this case the structure is full except that it does not contain ""data"" and ""sign"". So i need only add these elements. But i did not found the way how to do this. Does anybody know?</p>
","<p>You generally do not want (or are technically blocked) from extracting the private key from a smartcard. As this is sort of the very point of a smartcard - a tamper proof bit of crypto memory and connected CPU that will never divulge your private key.</p>

<p>So instead you need to ask the chipcard nicely to do the signing for you.</p>

<p>OpenSSL can do this - but needs to know how to talk to the chipcard. That is generally done with an 'engine'. Most commonly a pkcs#11 of #15 is used for this - in conjunction with the vendors chipcard (reader) driver. </p>

<p>You then typically need to get the slot and key identifiers:</p>

<pre><code># Extracting slot, auth ids and key id's for later use/reference
#
set `pkcs11-tool --module /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so --list-slots | grep Slot | grep SCM`
SLOT=$2
set `pkcs15-tool --list-keys | grep ID`
AID=$4
KID=$7
</code></pre>

<p>After which you can do 'things' on the card:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/bin/openssl &lt;&lt; EOM
engine dynamic -pre SO_PATH:/Library/OpenSC/lib/engines/engine_pkcs11.so  -pre ID:pkcs11 -pre LIST_ADD:1 -pre LOAD -pre MODULE_PATH:opensc-pkcs11.so
XXX -engine pkcs11 -b-key slot_$SLOT-id_$KID -keyform engine  ....
EOM
</code></pre>

<p>One such thing can be signing a pkcs7. From code - pretty much do the same thing. I usually use the app/util convenience stuf from openssl it's apps directory to make live a bit easier.</p>

As I'm sure we all know, AES works on 16-byte blocks, so if I want to encrypt a file that isn't exactly a multiple of 16, then I'll have to pad the file to make it a multiple of 16. PKCS #7 padding scheme says that I should pad the last chunk with N bytes all of value N. This is how I do that in my encryption function.</p>

<pre><code>for chunk in getChunks(plainFile, chunkSizeBytes):
    padLength = ((AES.block_size - len(chunk)) % AES.block_size)
    # We have to have padding!
    if padLength == 0:
        padLength = 16

    chunk += pad.encode('utf-8')

    # Write the encrypted chunk to an output file.

You must implement an OCSP to validate those certificates and if everything checks out all right you should and must request a timestamp to a third party to vouch for your pkcs#7.

<p>SignedCms.Decode reads the encoded message and populates members. Every direct signatory to the message can be read from the SignedCms::SignerInfos property (counter-signers, or entities which have signed that they witnessed the original signature, can be read from SignerInfo::CounterSignerInfos).</p>

<p>When you call SignedCms.CheckSignature, it checks every SigerInfo and verifies that the signature can be successfully verified (or throws an exception), as well as that every counter-signer signature can be worked out.</p>

<p>What it doesn't know is that any of the signers ""made sense"".  For that check you would need to loop over each SignerInfo and look at (for example) the Certificate property; then perform a suitability check:</p>

<ul>
<li>Perhaps it is a pre-registered public key</li>
<li>Perhaps it chains up to a well-known root or intermediate CA</li>
<li>Perhaps it has some sort of Extension which shows it to be suitable</li>
</ul>

<p>This part SignedCms cannot realistically do for you, since there's no default notion of ""suitable"" for messages, unlike the hostname verification of TLS.</p>

<p>If you want to assess the signature of a single signer, you can call SignedInfo::CheckSignature, but that's redundant if you also called SignedCms::CheckSignature.</p>

It's valid to have a SignedCms message which does not embed the signer certificates, leaving it up to the recipient to have known the valid certs ahead of time (e.g. using a per-user database of pre-registered certificates).

<p>The X509 stack pointer needs to point to a stack that contains the certificates one wishes to place in the degenerate PKCS#7 object.  </p>

<p>The BIO pointer needs to point to an empty BIO structure that will later be populated with the PKCS#7 object.</p>

num = sk.push(cert)

# At this point, the X509 stack contains 2 certificates.
print('num: %d' %num)

bio = BIO.MemoryBuffer()

# Request to create the degenerate PCKS#7 object.

  <p>To create the signature file, make a PKCS #7 detached signature of the manifest file</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'll be using the <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-pkcs7-sign.php"" rel=""nofollow""><code>openssl_pkcs7_sign</code></a> function using the flag <code>PKCS7_DETACHED</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>using the private key associated with your signing certificate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'll be using the location of my ssl <code>cert.pem</code> file as the <code>signcert</code> parameter and the location of the <code>cert.key</code> file as the <code>privkey</code> parameter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Include the WWDR intermediate certificate as part of the signature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'll include the path to the WWDR certificate in the <code>extracerts</code> parameter</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Include the date and time that the pass was signed using the S/MIME signing-time attribute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'll include a an array with a key <code>signing-time</code> and value something like <code>2015-05-03 10:40:00</code> for the <code>headers</code> parameter.</p>

<h2>My code:</h2>

<pre><code>private function createSignature($dir)
{
    $cert = '/etc/ssl/cert.pem';
    $key = '/etc/ssl/private/cert.key';
    $wwdr = '/location/of/apple/wwdr/cert.cer';
    $headers = [
        'signing-time' =&gt; (new DateTime())-&gt;format('o-m-d H:i:s'),
    ];

    return openssl_pkcs7_sign(""$dir/manifest.json"", ""$dir/signature"", $cert, $key, $headers, PKCS7_DETACHED, $wwdr);
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Other questions:</h2>

<p>I've noticed in the examples of the documentation for the <code>openssl_pkcs7_sign</code> function that <em>some</em> locations of the files are prefixed with <code>file://</code>. Why is this?</p>

<p>The C# code is ""ok"" as it is.</p>

<p>""ok"" is a big word here. I would probably use SHA256 and trim it to 24 bytes:</p>

<p>C#:</p>

<pre><code>SHA256Managed sha256 = new SHA256Managed();

Array.Resize(ref keyArray, 24);

<pre><code>$key = ""6702BC24DD0527E7"";
$key = hash(""sha256"",$key,TRUE);
$key = substr($key,0,24);
</code></pre>

<p>and still would be ""lower case OK""... Normally you should use AES and one of the various block chaining modes, like CBC (that requires a IV), and the password should be ""strenghtened"" with an algorithm, like PBKDF2 (requires PHP >= 5.5)</p>

<p>I have a code which uses m2crypto to get a certificate out of it.</p>

<pre><code>bio = BIO.MemoryBuffer(pkcs7message)

<p>It works. However, certStack returns only one certificate (instead of returning the whole chain of certificates.</p>

<p>Two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Am I missing something (may be there is an option to let it know that I need the whole chain)</li>
<li>Are there other methods how to get the whole chain (may be using pyopenssl)?</li>
</ul>
","<p>I guess you are making a confusion between signers and certificate chain of a signer. <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/crypto/PKCS7_get0_signers.html"">PKCS7_get0_signers</a> return the list of signers.</p>

<p>In order to building a PKCS7 message with 2 signers, you can use following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Build key and certificate for first signer:</p>

<pre><code>openssl genrsa -out key1.pem
openssl req -new -key key1.pem -subj ""/CN=key1"" | openssl x509 -req -signkey key1.pem -out cert1.pem
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Build key and certificate for second signer:</p>

<pre><code>openssl genrsa -out key2.pem
openssl req -new -key key2.pem -subj ""/CN=key2"" | openssl x509 -req -signkey key2.pem -out cert2.pem
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Create an PKCS7 message using both signers :</p>

<pre><code>echo ""Hello"" | openssl smime -sign -nodetach \
  -out signature.der -outform DER \
  -inkey key1.pem -signer cert1.pem -inkey key2.pem -signer cert2.pem 
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Then signers could be printed running your python script:</p>

<pre><code>from M2Crypto import *

bio=BIO.File(open('signature.der'))
smime_object = SMIME.PKCS7(m2.pkcs7_read_bio_der(bio._ptr()))    
signers = smime_object.get0_signers(X509.X509_Stack())

for cert in signers:
    print(cert.get_issuer().as_text())
</code></pre>

<p>It give the signers' issuer:</p>

<p>I can get a valid TimeStamp, and I could put it into my CMSSignedData object and save it to a file writting the bytes from signedData.getEncoded() to the harddisk. But when I validate my new shinny timestamped file with a <a href=""http://www.xolido.com/lang/productosxolidosign/xolidosignescritorio/"" rel=""nofollow"">third party software</a>, this software tells the original signature is ok, but the Timestamp doesn't correspond with the signature. This software also can show me the original plain text message.</p>

<p>I think the problem is in this line:</p>

<pre><code>TimeStampRequest request =
    reqGen.generate(TSPAlgorithms.SHA1, new byte[20], BigInteger.valueOf(100));
</code></pre>

<p>I think I have to pass a digest instead of a dummy byte array, but I don't know which digest, or what are the right bytes I have to timeStamp.
I successfully could get and verify a <code>SignerInformation</code> object from my <code>signedData</code>. Then I tried to pass to the <code>reqGen.generate()</code> function the bytes from <code>mySignerInformation.getSignature()</code>. The timestamp verification failed. Then I passed a Sha1 digest of <code>mySignerInformation.getSignature()</code>, but my timestamp verification failed again.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3161.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">RFC3161 specification</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2.4.1. Request Format</p>
  
  <p>A time-stamping request is as follows:</p>
  
  <p>TimeStampReq ::= SEQUENCE  {    version                      INTEGER 
  { v1(1) },    messageImprint               MessageImprint,
       --a hash algorithm OID and the hash value of the data to be</p>
  
  <p>(...)</p>
  
  <p>The messageImprint field SHOULD contain the hash of the datum to be
  time-stamped.  The hash is represented as an OCTET STRING.  Its<br>
  length MUST match the length of the hash value for that algorithm<br>
  (e.g., 20 bytes for SHA-1 or 16 bytes for MD5).</p>
  
  <p>MessageImprint ::= SEQUENCE  {
          hashAlgorithm                AlgorithmIdentifier,
          hashedMessage                OCTET STRING  }</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it doesn't tell me where or how I get the MessageImprint data if I want to TimeStamp the bytes inside a CMSSignedData object.</p>

<p>I'm a newbie in this digital signature stuff.</p>
","<p>You're right, the problem is that you're timestamping the incorrect data. The rest of the code seems correct to me.</p>

<p>So the thing is that you've to timestamp the hash of the signature. To get the signature from your <code>CMSSignedData</code> and hash it; you can use the follow code (supposing that you've only one signer in your <code>PKCS7</code> and you're using <code>SHA1</code> hash algorithm): </p>

<pre><code>CMSSignedData signedData = ...
// get the signers of your CMSSignedData signedData
Collection ss = signedData.getSignerInfos().getSigners();
SignerInformation si = (SignerInformation) ss.iterator().next();
// hash the signature
byte[] signDigest = MessageDigest
      .getInstance(TSPAlgorithms.SHA1, new BouncyCastleProvider())
      .digest(si.getSignature()); // since you're adding the bc provider with Security.addProvider you can use ""BC"" instead of passing the new BouncyCastleProvider() 
TimeStampRequestGenerator reqGen = new TimeStampRequestGenerator();
// generate the TSRequest
TimeStampRequest request =
            reqGen.generate(TSPAlgorithms.SHA1, signDigest, BigInteger.valueOf(100));
...

<p>i've tried to do as described <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38123106/pyopenssl-to-verify-the-file-signature"">here</a>, but there is different case - i have attached signature and do not have separate signature and certificate file - i have ASN.1 encoded file, which contains as certificates as data and signature</p>
","<p>There are several hurdles to overcome to achieve what you are looking for.</p>

<p>First, the <code>pyopenssl</code> binding itself is  limited when it comes to its <code>crypto</code> module, where you desired functionality resides. In fact, <a href=""https://pyopenssl.org/en/stable/api/crypto.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the <code>pyopenssl crypto</code> documentation</a> states:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fcTyf.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fcTyf.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
The <a href=""https://github.com/pyca/cryptography"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>pyca/cryptography</code></a> module mentioned is exposed via two internal attributes of the <code>pyopenssl crypto</code> module, with the names <code>_lib</code> and <code>_ffi</code>, which need to be used to get to the required functionality.</p>

<p>Then the <code>CMS_verify()</code> function that would be your logical choice for this is not included in the <code>pyca/cryptography</code> bindings either. However, for your purpose it is probably good enough to use <code>PKCS7_verify()</code> -- you can read all about that in a StackExchange question <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/41399/59016"">OpenSSL PKCS#7 vs. S/MIME</a>. The function <a href=""https://pyopenssl.org/en/stable/api/crypto.html#OpenSSL.crypto.load_pkcs7_data"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>crypto.load_pkcs7_data()</code></a> comes in handy.</p>

<p>All that said, the following code snippet might do it for you -- although from your description it is not clear to me whether the certificate of the signer is included in the <code>.p7s</code> file (in that case you do not have to give <code>-signer</code> as an argument to <code>openssl cms -verify</code> like you did). It worked for me, so give it a try:</p>

<pre><code>from OpenSSL import crypto
from OpenSSL._util import (
    ffi as _ffi,
    lib as _lib,
)

# Or, alternatively:
# from cryptography.hazmat.bindings.openssl.binding import Binding
# _lib = Binding.lib
# _ffi = Binding.ffi

with open('message_der.p7s', 'rb') as f:
    p7data = f.read()
p7 = crypto.load_pkcs7_data(crypto.FILETYPE_ASN1, p7data)

bio_out =crypto._new_mem_buf()
res = _lib.PKCS7_verify(p7._pkcs7, _ffi.NULL, _ffi.NULL, _ffi.NULL, bio_out, _lib.PKCS7_NOVERIFY)
if res == 1:
    databytes = crypto._bio_to_string(bio_out)
    print(databytes)
else:
    errno = _lib.ERR_get_error()
    errstrlib = _ffi.string(_lib.ERR_lib_error_string(errno))
    errstrfunc = _ffi.string(_lib.ERR_func_error_string(errno))
    errstrreason = _ffi.string(_lib.ERR_reason_error_string(errno)) 
</code></pre>

<p>In case you decide to use this approach, here is <a href=""https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/bindings/openssl/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a caveat about using this OpenSSL bindings module directly</a>:

<li><p>I have an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET"" rel=""nofollow"">ASP.NET</a> webservice that makes requests to another third-party server and receives a PKCS #7 signed token in response (it's actually not important where this token comes from). My web service then checks the token's signature (and validity) and returns the enclosed data to the user that invoked the method.</p></li>
<li><p>The web service is configured to run in a dedicated application pool, which runs under a Windows <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory"" rel=""nofollow"">AD</a> user account, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services"" rel=""nofollow"">IIS</a> 6.</p></li>

</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>In order to simplify things, I wrote a little Windows Forms application with the exact same code. I logged in interactively to the same server where the web service is hosted, using the same user account in the application pool's. Run the EXE file there and it works fine, that is,  were able to verify the signature perfectly. IMO, this rules out any problem like a missing  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority"" rel=""nofollow"">certificate authority</a> (CA) certificate and so on (in fact, I have the signer's .CER file, I open it in Windows, and it tells me that the chain is OK).</p>

<p>So apparently the only difference is that in the first case my process is a web service and in the second a desktop EXE file. What else could be happening that prevents me to perform the verification in the first case?</p>

<p>This snippet of code above should normally add certificates. I took this from EJBCA.</p>

<p>Here is how I complete the signed data:    </p>

<pre><code>CMSSignedDataGenerator gen1 = new CMSSignedDataGenerator();
// I add ALL of my attributes here
// Once they're added...
Certificate caCert = this.caCertificate;
try {
    String provider = BouncyCastleProvider.PROVIDER_NAME;
    ContentSigner contentSigner = new JcaContentSignerBuilder(signatureAlgorithmName).
            setProvider(provider).
            build(signerKey);
    JcaDigestCalculatorProviderBuilder calculatorProviderBuilder = new JcaDigestCalculatorProviderBuilder().
            setProvider(provider);
    JcaSignerInfoGeneratorBuilder builder = new JcaSignerInfoGeneratorBuilder(calculatorProviderBuilder.build());
    builder.setSignedAttributeGenerator(new DefaultSignedAttributeTableGenerator(new AttributeTable(attributes)));
    gen1.addSignerInfoGenerator(builder.build(contentSigner, (X509Certificate) ca));
} catch (Handle all exceptions) {}

// Create the signed data
CMSSignedData sd = gen1.generate(msg, true);
byte[] results = sd.getEncoded();
</code></pre>

<p>The bytes array results is the DER formatted PKCS7 signed data... but no certificate is added.</p>

<p>Am I missing something? Thank you for your help!</p>
","<p>The <code>CMSSignedDataGenerator gen1</code> has to explicitly add the certificate, which I wasn't aware of.</p>

<p>It can simply be done by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adding the certificates to a <code>List</code> of <code>X509Certificates</code>;</li>
<li>Converting that <code>List</code> into a <code>Collection</code> of <code>JcaX509CertificateHolder</code>;</li>
<li>Adding this collection to a <code>CollectionStore</code> of <code>JcaX509CertificateHolder</code>;</li>
<li>Adding the store the <code>CMSSignedDataGenerator</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Code sample:</p>

<pre><code> CMSSignedDataGenerator gen1 = new CMSSignedDataGenerator();
 List&lt;X509Certificate&gt; certificates = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

 // I chose to add the CA certificate
 certificates.add((X509Certificate) this.caCertificate);

 // In this case, this is a certificate that I need to add
 if (this.certificate != null)
     certificates.add((X509Certificate) this.certificate);

 // This is the recipient certificate
 if (this.recipientCert != null)
     certificates.add((X509Certificate) this.recipientCert);
 Collection&lt;JcaX509CertificateHolder&gt; x509CertificateHolder = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

 // Of course, we need to handle the exceptions...
 for (X509Certificate certificate : certificates) {
     x509CertificateHolder.add(new JcaX509CertificateHolder(certificate));
 }
 CollectionStore&lt;JcaX509CertificateHolder&gt; store = new CollectionStore&lt;&gt;(x509CertificateHolder);

// The final stage.

<p>Could someone explain what is happening?. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>
","<p>The CMS signature container embedded in your PDF has some questionable properties. In particular it has an encapsulated content, even though it merely is a byte array of length 0. This makes iText include this value in a test which then fails. I would propose creating cleaner signature containers.</p>

<h2>In detail</h2>

<p>The CMS object type <code>EncapsulatedContentInfo</code> is specified as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>5.2.  EncapsulatedContentInfo Type</h2>
  
  <p>The content is represented in the type EncapsulatedContentInfo:</p>

<pre><code> EncapsulatedContentInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
    eContentType ContentType,
    eContent [0] EXPLICIT OCTET STRING OPTIONAL }

 ContentType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER
</code></pre>
  
  <p>The fields of type EncapsulatedContentInfo have the following
     meanings:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>eContentType is an object identifier.  The object identifier
          uniquely specifies the content type.</p>
    
    <p>eContent is the content itself, carried as an octet string.  The
          eContent need not be DER encoded.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>The optional omission of the eContent within the
     EncapsulatedContentInfo field makes it possible to construct
     ""external signatures"".  In the case of external signatures, the
     content being signed is absent from the EncapsulatedContentInfo value
     included in the signed-data content type.  If the eContent value
     within EncapsulatedContentInfo is absent, then the signatureValue is
     calculated and the eContentType is assigned as though the eContent
     value was present.</p>
  
  <p><em>(<a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652#section-5.2"" rel=""nofollow"">RFC 5652 section 5.2</a>)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So for signature containers embedded into a PDF, <code>eContent</code> should be omitted to indicate that not this <code>eContent</code> is signed but separate data, the surrounding PDF data.</p>

<p>The signature container of the OP's signed document contains this <code>EncapsulatedContentInfo</code> object:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;30 0F&gt;
  43   15:       SEQUENCE {
    &lt;06 09&gt;
  45    9:         OBJECT IDENTIFIER data (1 2 840 113549 1 7 1)
         :           (PKCS #7)
    &lt;A0 02&gt;
  56    2:         [0] {
    &lt;04 00&gt;
  58    0:           OCTET STRING
         :           }
         :         }
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, this signature container does not have omitted the <code>eContent</code> and so makes iText include this array into its checks to eventually fail.</p>

<h2>This actually is a bug, though</h2>

<p>I formulated the above in a fairly restrained manner for a simple reason: Even though that use of the <code>EncapsulatedContentInfo</code> type is misleading, it is <strong>not outright invalid</strong> in the case at hand!</p>

<p>For the original ISO 32000-1 integrated signatures, that norm specified</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When PKCS#7 signatures are used, the value of <strong>Contents</strong> shall be a DER-encoded PKCS#7 binary data
  object containing the signature. The PKCS#7 object shall conform to RFC3852 Cryptographic Message
  Syntax. Different subfilters may be used and shall be registered in accordance with Annex E. <strong>SubFilter</strong> shall
  take one of the following values:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>adbe.pkcs7.detached</strong>: The original signed message digest over the document’s byte range shall be
  incorporated as the normal PKCS#7 SignedData field. No data shall be encapsulated in the PKCS#7
  SignedData field.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>adbe.pkcs7.sha1</strong>: The SHA1 digest of the document’s byte range shall be encapsulated in the PKCS#7
  SignedData field with ContentInfo of type Data. The digest of that SignedData shall be incorporated as the
  normal PKCS#7 digest.</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><em>(<a href=""http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">ISO 32000-1</a> section 12.8.3.3 PKCS#7 Signatures as used in ISO 32000)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So for such signatures there either was no encapsulated data (not even a zero-length byte array) or the encapsulated data were a digest value to check.</p>

<p>This is why iText's verification code in one place assumes it is in the latter case: As there is some encapsulated content, it must be a hash to check.</p>

<hr>

<p>The signature at hand, though, is not of one of those original types but it uses <strong>SubFilter ETSI.CAdES.detached</strong>. These signatures are originally specified by ETSI:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>4.2 General Requirements</h2>
  
  <p>For all profiles covered in the present document: </p>
  
  <p>b) A DER-encoded SignedData object as specified in CMS (RFC 3852) shall be included as the PDF
  signature in the entry with the key <strong>Content</strong> of the signature dictionary as described in ISO 32000-1,
  clause 12.8.1. This CMS object forms a CAdES signature described in TS 101 733 as it may contain
  several attributes required by the rules given in the following clauses. </p>
  
  <p>d) Requirements specified in ISO 32000-1, clauses 12.8.3.2 (PKCS#1) and 12.8.3.3 (PKCS#7) signatures as
  used in ISO 32000-1 do not apply. </p>
  
  <h2>4.6.2 Document Digest</h2>
  
  <p>The verifier shall check that the document digest matches that in the signature as specified in ISO 32000-1,
  clause 12.8.1 </p>
  
  <p><em>(<a href=""https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102700_102799/10277803/01.01.02_60/ts_10277803v010102p.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">ETSI TS 102 778-3 V1.1.2 (2009-12)</a>)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So for signatures as in the case at hand, the section from ISO 32000-1 partially quoted before does not apply, and the hash in the signature (the message-digest attribute) has to match the document digest (calculated as defined by ISO 32000-1, i.e. only for the defined byte ranges) without consideration of the encapsulated content.</p>

<p>The next step is to use this key and certificate to create a signed PKCS7 file.  This is easy to do with openssl:</p>

<pre><code>openssl smime -binary -sign \
    -signer certificate.pem -inkey key.pem \
    -in &lt;datafile&gt; -out signature \
    -outform DER
</code></pre>

<p>The question is, what is the best way to do this in Google App Engine, assuming I have the certificate and key?  Unfortunately I'm a little new to cryptography, but I've been googling around and found PyCrypto and keyczar.  Is there an accepted way to do this on App Engine, or will I need to write something?  Any recommendations on which package to start with?<br>
I know that openssl is not available on AppEngine, but PyCrypto is if you use python 2.7, right?  And I've seen posts of people getting keyczar to work with it.  I have not been able to find a simple way of generating PKCS7-encoded data given the key and certificate, though.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any guidance.</p>

<p>The problem seems to be the choice of PHP's functions (or PHP's OpenSSL offerings). Perhaps you should use something else, like a library that provides what you need.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's what is really available from OpenSSL. From <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/PKCS7_encrypt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">PKCS7_encrypt(3)</a>:</p>

<pre><code>PKCS7 *PKCS7_encrypt(STACK_OF(X509) *certs, BIO *in, const EVP_CIPHER *cipher, int flags);
</code></pre>

<p>You use a <code>BIO</code> for the <code>in-data</code>, and that can be a memory <code>BIO</code>. There's no reason to write a disk file.</p>

<p>You have similar for <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/PKCS7_decrypt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">PKCS7_decrypt(3)</a>:</p>

<pre><code>int PKCS7_decrypt(PKCS7 *p7, EVP_PKEY *pkey, X509 *cert, BIO *data, int flags);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, for the keys. The keys can be read (and written) using <code>BIO</code>s too. That means they can use a memory bio. But I'm not sure how useful that would be since the keys have to be stored somewhere.</p>

<p>For the reference, see <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/pem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">pem(3)</a>. There's almost too many functions to list:</p>

DWORD len;

CryptDecodeObjectEx(
    X509_ASN_ENCODING | PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING,
    PKCS_CONTENT_INFO,
    pointer_to_extracted_signature,
    length_of_extracted_signature,
    CRYPT_DECODE_ALLOC_FLAG,
    NULL,
    &amp;content_info,
    &amp;len
);
</code></pre>

<p>The above call completes successfully and <code>content_info-&gt;pszObjId</code> will have an OID of ""1.2.840.113549.1.7.2"" (szOID_RSA_signedData) however I am unable to find the structures needed to continue decoding. The available OID's for CryptDecodeObjectEx are listed <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa378145(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Can anybody please advise how to decode an Authenticode PKCS#7 signature via the Windows API?</p>
","<p>I have found the correct way to decode an Authenticode PKCS#7 signature is to use <code>CryptQueryObject</code> with the <code>CERT_QUERY_OBJECT_BLOB</code> and <code>CERT_QUERY_CONTENT_FLAG_PKCS7_SIGNED</code> flags set. Code snippit below for anybody who might need to do this.</p>

<pre><code>CERT_BLOB cert_blob;
HCERTSTORE cert_store = NULL;
HCRYPTMSG cert_msg    = NULL;

cert_blob.pbData = pointer_to_extracted_signature;
cert_blob.cbData = length_of_extracted_signature;

CryptQueryObject(
    CERT_QUERY_OBJECT_BLOB,
    &amp;cert_blob,
    CERT_QUERY_CONTENT_FLAG_PKCS7_SIGNED,
    CERT_QUERY_FORMAT_FLAG_BINARY,
    0,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    &amp;cert_store,
    &amp;cert_msg,
    NULL
);

PCCERT_CONTEXT next_cert = NULL;

while( (next_cert = CertEnumCertificatesInStore( cert_store, next_cert ) ) != NULL )
{
    // process next_cert...
}

","<p>There are several situations in which Adobe calls a signer's certificate invalid even though apparently it is valid; in the case at hand in particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>Key usage or Extended key usage values not appropriate</li>
<li>PAdES signature misses an ESS signing-certificate-v2 attribute</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key usage or Extended key usage values not appropriate</h3>

<p><em>This is based on the information the OP first published as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/52763251/1729265"">an answer</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I tried below code still the pdf says Signature is invalid. Can you please check the code,</em></p>
  
  <p><em>[...]</em></p>
  
  <p><em>I have attached the pdf . <a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=14_n5-HV37SsrOYlnAYrQ9Sd6lvDMFPSD"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pdf file created</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, Adobe Reader says the signature is invalid, but look more closely:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/33XQL.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/33XQL.png"" alt=""Signature panel""></a></p>

<p>It says ""Document has not been modified since this signature was applied"" - This means that <strong>the signature is mathematically correct!</strong></p>

<p>The issue is that the ""Signer's certificate is invalid"", and the reason for this can be seen when digging into the signature property dialogues:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/g3WYb.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/g3WYb.png"" alt=""Certificate Details""></a></p>

<p>Thus, the problem is that your signer certificate is <strong>Not valid for usage</strong>.</p>

<p>This is due to the highlighted attribute, while the Key Usage <em>Digital Signature</em> is ok, the ""Extended key usage"" <em>1.3.6.1.5.5.8.2.2</em> (OID for <em>IPSEC Protection</em>) is not!</p>

<p>According to the Adobe <a href=""https://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/DigSig/changes.html#id1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Digital Signatures Guide for IT</a>, Adobe Acrobat accepts only</p>

<ul>
<li><p>one or more of the following Key usage values (if any)</p>

<ul>
<li>nonRepudiation</li>
<li>signTransaction (11.0.09 only)</li>
<li>digitalSignature (11.0.10 and later)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>and one or more of the following Extended key usage values (if any)</p>

<ul>
<li>emailProtection</li>
<li>codeSigning</li>
<li>anyExtendedKeyUsage</li>
<li>1.2.840.113583.1.1.5 (Adobe Authentic Documents Trust)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Due to its <em>IPSEC Protection</em> extended key usage value, therefore, your certificate is not considered valid for signing PDF documents.</p>

<p><em>This probably only is an issue in legacy ISO 32000-1 signatures, probably not in PAdES signatures.</em></p>

<h3>PAdES signature misses an ESS signing-certificate-v2 attribute</h3>

<p><em>This is based on the information the OP first published as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/52763251/1729265"">an answer</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I have created 2 pdf files, PDFA is signed using the digest of the pdf content with below code,</em></p>
  
  <p><em>[...]</em></p>
  
  <p><em><a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=132-P95iUEirzk0PMY5Ccnh8lmchzFU89"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PDFA</a></em></p>
  
  <p><em>PDFB is created with the same private key and certificate, but instead of digest I am using pdf document content directly which gives me valid signed pdf, PDFB code below,</em></p>
  
  <p><em>[...]</em></p>
  
  <p><em><a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_2DXCgQDbuNSCYl7POVHlXwIf86Gzp2T"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PDFB</a></em></p>
  
  <p><em>I think something is missing in the signing part of PDFA which I couldn't figure out.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here the main difference is not whether you explicitly calculate the hash yourself or allow it to be calculated implicitly, the main difference is that the signature in PDFB includes an ESS signing-certificate-v2 attribute while the one in PDFA does not. This attribute is generated between</p>

<pre><code>//PAdES - PDF Advanced Electronic Signature
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>//PAdES-end
</code></pre>

<p>As the comments already hint, this is only necessary for PAdES signatures, not for legacy ISO 32000-1 ones. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/41848320/1729265"">The answer the OP took his original code from</a> referred to creating a legacy ISO 32000-1 signature (and, therefore, works alright) while the OP creates a PAdES signature.</p>

<p>The presence of an ESS signing certificate attribute is required by the PAdES specification ETSI EN 319 142-1: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>e) Generators shall use either the signing certificate or the signing-certificate v2 attribute, depending on the hash function, in accordance with ETSI EN 319 122-1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(ETSI EN 319 142-1, section 6.3 PAdES baseline signatures)</em></p>

<p>It references the CAdES specification ETSI EN 319 122-1 which in turn requires</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>h) Requirement for SPO: ESS <code>signing-certificate</code>. The ESS <code>signing-certificate</code> attribute shall be used if the SHA-1 hash algorithm is used.</p>
  
  <p>i) Requirement for SPO: ESS <code>signing-certificate-v2</code>. The ESS <code>signing-certificate-v2</code> attribute shall be used when another hash algorithms than SHA-1 is used.</p>

","<p>There is no such thing as an hexadecimal byte. In Java a byte consists of 8 bits. When viewed as a number these bits contain a 8 bit two-complement number from -128 to 127. Hexadecimals is a textual representation of values - such as the Java byte - for human consumption.</p>

<p>Integers are usually not supported on Java Card classic, so I'll just show how to convert short values to bytes.</p>

<p>If you are already sure that the short <code>s</code> contains a byte in the lower 8 bits then conversion is simple:</p>

<pre><code>byte b = (byte) s;
</code></pre>

<p>if you are not sure you must decide if you want to allow. If you just care about the 8 lower bits: see above.</p>

<p>If you however want to have a positive number 0..255 stored in the byte, you can check using:</p>

<pre><code>if (s &lt; 0 || s &gt; BYTE_MAX_UNSIGNED) {
    // do something nasty
}
byte b = (byte) s;
</code></pre>

<p>or for the negative values -128 to 127:</p>

<pre><code>if (s &lt; BYTE_MIN || s &gt; BYTE_MAX) {
    // do something nasty
}
byte b = (byte) s;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course the values of the constants is:</p>

<pre><code>private static final short BYTE_MAX = 0x7F;
private static final short BYTE_MIN = -0x80;
private static final short BYTE_MAX_UNSIGNED = 0xFF;
</code></pre>

<p>If you keep them <code>private static final</code> then these constants will be inlined into your bytecode by the converter.</p>

<p>As you can see the final byte encoding is identical for both cases. This is why two-complement is the default encoding in about every computer on the planet.</p>

<p>Note that regardless of the value of the short, the byte will hold a value from -128 to 127. If you want to convert the byte to a positive value for calculations, you can use:</p>

<pre><code>short s = b &amp; BYTE_MAX_UNSIGNED;
</code></pre>

<p>to get back a positive value from 0 to 255.</p>

","<p>See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_(cryptography)#PKCS7"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PKCS#7 padding</a>. The reason for padding an exact multiple of the block size is there would be no way to tell if there was no padding so padding must either always or never be used. Consider if the data was 4096 bytes and the last byte was 0x01. Looks like one byte of padding but it isn't, it is part of the data.</p>

<p>As Zaph stated, PKCS#7 padding is being added. The padding is deterministic, so an exact multiple of 16 byts is also padded to ensure removal. Otherwise, how does a generalized algorithm know when (1) plain text ends on a 16-byte boundary, versus (2) plain text <em>not</em> ends on a 16-byte boundary and padded?</p>

<p>You can disable the padding behavior on the cipher object with <a href=""http://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/crypto/EVP_CIPHER_CTX_ctrl.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>EVP_CIPHER_CTX_ctrl</code></a> and <a href=""http://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/crypto/EVP_CIPHER_CTX_ctrl.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding</code></a>. <code>EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding</code> is a macro'd version of <code>EVP_CIPHER_CTX_ctrl</code>. Here is what it looks like:</p>

<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>int EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding(EVP_CIPHER_CTX *x, int padding);
</code></pre>

<p>From the man page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding() enables or disables padding. By default
  encryption operations are padded using standard block padding and the
  padding is checked and removed when decrypting. If the pad parameter
  is zero then no padding is performed, the total amount of data
  encrypted or decrypted must then be a multiple of the block size or an
  error will occur.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what I need to do to create x-pkcs messages or point me to some examples?</p>

<p>Regards</p>
","<p>There are 2 different ways to sign a message using S/MIME:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>application/[x-]pkcs7-mime; smime-type=signed-data</code></li>
<li><code>application/[x-]pkcs7-signature</code></li>
</ol>

<p>To sign the first way, do this:</p>

<pre><code>var signer = new MailboxAddress ("""", ""signer@example.com"");
var signed = ApplicationPkcs7Mime.Sign (signer, DigestAlgorithm.Sha256, entity);
</code></pre>

<p>The other way is done like this:</p>

<pre><code>using (var ctx = new WindowsSecureMimeContext ()) {
    var signer = new MailboxAddress ("""", ""signer@example.com"");
    var signed = MultipartSigned.Sign (ctx, signer, DigestAlgorithm.Sha256, entity);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In both cases, you can also use a <code>MimeKit.Cryptography.CmsSigner</code> instead of a <code>MailboxAddress</code>. You could also use a <code>SecureMailboxAddress</code> if you know the fingerprint of the certificate.</p>

<p>I could read in one or more Certificates from a PKCS#7 file, but I don't know how to write them to a PKCS#7 file. I only know that the data in this file is PEM encoded and this data is within the tags <code>--- BEGINN PKCS7 ---</code> and <code>--- END PKCS7 ---</code>.</p>
","<p>At first, read the whole RFC for PKCS#7/CMS for better understanding. Please follow this <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652"" rel=""nofollow"">RFC link</a>. 
</p>
For easy implementation use bouncycastle library. Now, There are different types of PKCS#7.CMS data (like signedData, envelopedData etc.). Lets take, you want to use signeData format. Then, you need to generate <a href=""https://www.bouncycastle.org/docs/pkixdocs1.4/org/bouncycastle/cms/CMSSignedData.html"" rel=""nofollow"">CMSSignedData</a> data. For that, you need to prepare private key and Certificate chain. Here, I am assuming, you already have those. Now prepare <a href=""https://www.bouncycastle.org/docs/pkixdocs1.4/org/bouncycastle/cms/CMSProcessableByteArray.html"" rel=""nofollow"">CMSProcessableByteArray</a>.
</p>
Sample code for CMSProcessableByteArray:</p>

<pre><code>CMSProcessableByteArray msg = new CMSProcessableByteArray(""Hello World"".getBytes());
</code></pre>

<p>hen declare CMSSignedDataGenerator and add signerInfo and certificates.</p>

<pre><code>CMSSignedDataGenerator gen = new CMSSignedDataGenerator();
gen.addSignerInfoGenerator(new JcaSignerInfoGeneratorBuilder(......));
gen.addCertificates(certs);
</code></pre>

<p>Then generate CMSSignedData with CMSSignedDataGenerator and CMSProcessableByteArray.</p>

<pre><code>CMSSignedData cmsData = gen.generate(msg, true);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, there are two formats for you to write the file in: Pem and Der. You want to write in pem encoded. So then, Take the whole data in a ContentInfo.</p>

<pre><code>ContentInfo ci = ContentInfo.getInstance(ASN1Object.fromByteArray(signedData));
</code></pre>

<p>Now, use Pemwriter to write the contentInfo object in p7b format. Open the file and see user certificates.</p>

<pre><code>PEMWriter pemWriter = new PEMWriter(new FileWriter(""Demo-CMS.p7b""));
pemWriter.writeObject(obj);
pemWriter.flush();
pemWriter.close();

cdata = open(""CERT.RSA"", ""rb"").read()
cert, rest = decode(cdata)
# The cert should be located there
realcert = encode(cert[1][3])
realcert = realcert[2 + (realcert[1] &amp; 0x7F) if realcert[1] &amp; 0x80 &gt; 1 else 2:]  # remove the first DER identifier from the front
x509.load_der_x509_certificate(realcert, default_backend())

  <p>The Signature </p>
  
  <p>The signature is a PKCS #7 detached signature of the
  manifest file. Sign the manifest file with the private key associated
  with your web push certificate that you obtained while registering
  with Apple. In PHP, you can do this with the openssl_pkcs7_sign
  function. The create_signature function in the attached
  createPushPackage.php companion file (the link is near the top of the
  page) shows how you can do this.</p>
  
  <p>If the contents of your push package ever change, you’ll need to
  recompute your signature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>in the same page apple put a example in php:</p>

<pre><code>// Creates a signature of the manifest using the push notification certificate.
function create_signature($package_dir, $cert_path, $cert_password) {
    // Load the push notification certificate
    $pkcs12 = file_get_contents($cert_path);
    $certs = array();
    if(!openssl_pkcs12_read($pkcs12, $certs, $cert_password)) {
        return;

    openssl_pkcs7_sign(""$package_dir/manifest.json"", $signature_path, $cert_data, $private_key, array(), PKCS7_BINARY | PKCS7_DETACHED);

    // Convert the signature from PEM to DER

<p>Kindly suggest what we can do to resolve this issue.</p>
","<p>I think your digital certificate and the Private key is an issue. Kindly create the Digital Certificate and Private Key with below command.</p>

<pre><code>openssl req -x509 -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout enc_key.pem -out selfcert.pem

<p>Then after that use that certificate and private key and that will work for you. It worked for me and if still you face issue do comment.</p>

"20704464","Parsing PKCS10 from PKCS7 in PHP","<p>Background: I'm implementing an MDM solution for WP8, on initial enrolment, the binary security token is a base 64 encoded PKCS10 CSR.  On certificate renewal, the soap request is exactly the same, only the token type specified is ""Renew"" and the binary security token is a base 64 encoded PKCS7.</p>

<p>I am trying to obtain a PKCS10 from a PKCS7 base64 encoded string - I've tried openssl_pkcs7_verify which takes a filename for content. I'm assuming the content that is written contains the CSR.  However, I cannot get this function to succeed and eventually resorted to the following which works - </p>

<pre><code>private function parsePKCS10( $insb64PKCS7 ) {
    $decodedPKCS7 = base64_decode( $insb64PKCS7 );

    $buffer = """";
    $b64PKCS10 = """";
    $lengthPKCS7 = strlen( $decodedPKCS7 );
    for ( $i = 0; $i &lt; $lengthPKCS7; ++$i ) {
        $currentChar = $decodedPKCS7[ $i ];
        if ( mb_detect_encoding( $currentChar ) == ""ASCII"" &amp;&amp; strlen( $currentChar ) != 0 ) {
            $buffer .= $currentChar;
        } else if ( (strlen( $currentChar ) != 0) || ($i + 1 &lt; $lengthPKCS7 &amp;&amp; strlen( $decodedPKCS7[ $i + 1 ] ) == 0) ) {
            if ( strlen( $buffer ) &gt; strlen( $b64PKCS10 ) ) {
                $b64PKCS10 = $buffer;
            }
            $buffer = """";
        }
    }

    return preg_replace( '/[\x00-\x1F\x80-\xFF]/', '', $b64PKCS10 ); //remove non-printable chars
}
</code></pre>

<p>I found an example online doing this in C# - </p>

<pre><code>private static string extractPKCS10(string PKCS7blob)
        {
            SignedCms cms = new SignedCms();
            cms.Decode(System.Convert.FromBase64String(PKCS7blob));
            byte[] csr = cms.ContentInfo.Content;

            return Encoding.Unicode.GetString(csr);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone know a better way of doing this in PHP, or should I stick with my current function which does the job?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>EDIT - </p>

<p>I found a better solution using PHPSecLib - </p>

<pre><code>$asn1 = new File_ASN1();

<p>How can I convert this <code>String</code> into a readable state? </p>

<p>So far, I've used the following website just to test: <a href=""https://certlogik.com/decoder/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://certlogik.com/decoder/</a></p>
","<p>Well, even if you never posted an approach showing us what you've tried before for achieving your task and even if you said that you are not a programmer <em>(I wonder how are you going to understand then).</em></p>

<p>I wanted to play around with this and this is what I got so far...</p>

<hr>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Since you are new to this, consider the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <strong><em>bouncycastle</em></strong> library within your project, include the <code>bcprov-jdk16-1.46.jar</code> file to the Build Path.</li>
<li>In order to use <strong><em>bouncycastle</em></strong> library, you'll need the ""Java Cryptography Extension"" JARs and, in order to do so, replace the <code>local_policy.jar</code> and <code>US_export_policy.jar</code> files located at <code>C:\path\to\Java\jdk1.7.0_79\jre\lib\security</code> with the ones from here: <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html</a> </li>
</ul>

<p><em>(the link will download a ZIP file with the JARs for Java 7 since I am using that version, you should download the right ones for the Java version that you are using)</em>.</p>

<h2>Project structure</h2>

<p>Just created a simple Java Project and defined this structure:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nGVR6.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nGVR6.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<h2>Java code</h2>

<p>Things to consider...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are many attributes to obtain from the certificate and getting some of them are a bit tricky (you'll need to do some research here in order to get them all, same way as: <a href=""https://certlogik.com/decoder/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://certlogik.com/decoder/</a> currently does).</p></li>
<li><p>I've changed the header/footer: <code>BEGIN PKCS7/END PKCS7</code> from the certificate, because of the following: <a href=""http://openssl.cs.utah.edu/docs/apps/pkcs7.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://openssl.cs.utah.edu/docs/apps/pkcs7.html</a> (read under ""Notes"" section) and because the certificate <code>String</code> can't be parsed as a <code>X509Certificate</code> object when not using the other ones, which are: <code>BEGIN CERTIFICATE/END CERTIFICATE</code>. Also, something that I noticed was that after decoding the certificate on the website that you provided, the <code>BEGIN PKCS7/END PKCS7</code> header/footer are replaced in your certificate <code>String</code> with the other ones that I was talking about before.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Obtained from above link:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The PEM PKCS#7 format uses the header and footer lines:</p>

"40685111","Why OpenSSL's PKCS7_verify() requires ""smimesign"" certificate purpose?","<p>Man page for <code>PKCS7_verify()</code> states that</p>

<p><code>...Each signer's certificate is chain verified using the smimesign purpose...
</code></p>

<p>Why is exactly this one purpose always required? I understand it so that a signed PKCS7 structure can be used for many things, S/MIME being just one of them.</p>

<p>If my signing certificate does not have <code>smimeSign</code> among its <code>extendedKeyUsage</code> extensions, <code>PKCS7_verify()</code> fails. I'd need to manually adjust the <code>purpose</code> in order to do the verification. Am I missing something here?</p>
","<p>Simply verifying the signature, checking that the signer's certificate is authentic and that the chain leads to a trusted root is not enough. Any verification code also must ensure that the certificate holder was entitled to perform the signing for the particular purpose. The vetting to get a certificate that has <code>smimeSign</code> privilege is a lot less stringent than the vetting for, say a code signing certificate.</p>

<p>Imagine a software development company where every employee has been issued a certificate for the purpose of email signing and encryption. This company also releases a software product, and provides a PKCS#7 signed distribution package of its product. If PKCS#7 verification functions did not check the purpose of the signing certificate (in this case we'd want <code>codesign</code>), a bad actor in the employ of the company could create a compromised version of the software product, and sign it with their E-Mail certificate (which only has the purpose <code>smimesign</code>.) </p>

<p>In the case of OpenSSL's <code>pkcs7_verify()</code>, the API was designed to imply a purpose instead of explicitly requiring one to be passed in, and <code>smimeSign</code> was chosen as default. I'm guessing that since S/MIME is the most common use of PKCS#7, it made sense, and it allows someone to verify PKCS#7 in most use cases without having to learn about <code>extendedKeyUsage</code>.</p>

<p>[Below my original answer, to address your pre-edit question '<em>Can I specify that I want to verify a signature in a PKCS7 against some other purpose'</em>:]</p>

<p>A certificate can contain an (optional) attribute called ""Extended Key Usage"". This attribute is used to indicate what the certificate is allowed to be used for. Some possible X509.v3 usages are:</p>

<ul>
<li>serverAuthentication</li>
<li>clientAuthentication</li>
<li>codeSigning</li>
<li>emailProtection</li>
<li>ipSecEndSystem</li>
<li>ipSecTunnel</li>
<li>timeStamping</li>
<li>ocspSigning</li>
<li>smartCardLogin</li>
<li>pkiPeerAuth</li>
</ul>

<p>You can check the <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.1/apps/x509v3_config.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">x509v3_config</a> man page for the key usage flags that openssl is aware of.</p>

<p>PKCS#7 is a general container format that allows for both signing and or encrypting the content of the container. S/MIME uses PKCS#7 for signing and/or encrypting email message, and in that case, the certificate being used should have the emailProtection usage.</p>

<p>If you wanted to distribute some code, and you want to make sure that the recipient can verify that the distribution is from you, and unaltered, you could use PKCS#7 to distribute, and in that case your certificate should have the codeSigning enhanced key usage attribute.
It is possible for a certificate to have multiple key usages, but in general it's a good idea to have a separate key (and therefore certificate) for different usage types.</p>

<p>Openssl, on the command line, supports specifying the desired purpose of the certificate when using the ""openssl smime"" command. For example,</p>

<pre><code>    openssl smime -verify -in myfile.p7b -inform DER -out my-p7-content -purpose any
</code></pre>

<p>will verify the signature in the file 'my file.p7p', it will write the content of the PKCS#7 container in file 'my-p7-content' and it will accept any valid certificate, no matter what its indicated purpose is. (-purpose any). Please note that the openssl man page for smime does not list the -purpose switch as an option, but it is indeed supported. </p>

<p>Since you quote the PKCS7_verify API documentation, programmatically, you can specify the purpose via the <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.1/crypto/X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_purpose</a> method when you're setting up your X509_STORE object. The following fragment should give you an idea of the process:</p>

<pre><code>X509_STORE store;
int purpose;

store = X509_STORE_new();
verify_params = X509_Store_get0_param(store);
purpose = X509_PURPOSE_get_by_sname(""sslclient"");
X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_purpose(verify_params, purpose)
...
PKCS7_verify(..., store, ...);
</code></pre>

<p>This will set the purpose to SSL Client when verifying.</p>

"17875035","Rolling my own PKCS#7 padding in PL/SQL","<p>I need to do some encryption in PL/SQL + Oracle using the outdated DBMS_OBFUSCATION_TOOLKIT package, but it has to be decryptable (if that's even a word) in both Java and Javascript.  The Java and JS decryptions use for PKCS#7 / PCKS#5 padding.

<p>The other employees don't need access to DBMS_CRYPTO, they just need access to <em>your</em> function.  So you can build a function which uses the restricted functionality in a specific and approved fashion, and make it widely available without violating the broader permissions issues.</p>

<p>Of course, I am assuming your application has implemented schemas in a sensible manner, which allows for dispersal of minimum necessary privileges on objects.

"17875035","Rolling my own PKCS#7 padding in PL/SQL","<p>I need to do some encryption in PL/SQL + Oracle using the outdated DBMS_OBFUSCATION_TOOLKIT package, but it has to be decryptable (if that's even a word) in both Java and Javascript.  The Java and JS decryptions use for PKCS#7 / PCKS#5 padding.  It's simple (I think) to implement Zero padding, and I could change the Java and JS, but I don't know if I'll ever have problems with the zero padding being irreversible.</p>

<p>Therefore, I'd like to roll my own PKCS#7, but I'm having some trouble producing the right output.  This code compares what I have side by size with the output from DBMS_CRYPTO, which has PKCS#5 implemented, but is not available to all employees, due to permissions issues:</p>

<p>The default IV is... I have no idea, but the OBFS toolkit and DBMS_CRYPTO have a different one.  I just had to specify it, I did the testing with a 0 IV.  Also, the default for OBFS is 2-key 3des, so I needed the <code>which =&gt; 1</code> to change it to 3key.  Thanks for the help!</p>

The original ""solution"" actually failed on Strings with length%8 == 0, due to a misinterpretation of the PKCS#7/5 spec...  I've update the solution above to show the entire/functioning code.</p>

"22063310","Adding authenticated attributes using MS CryptoApi","<p>I'm struggling adding authenticated attributes (OCSP data) to my message using CryptoApi. I first used CryptoApi's simplified message functions, but now switch to the low-level message functions, thinking that I would be able to control the message structure better. But I am once again stuck. My process is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initialize CMSG_SIGNER_ENCODE_INFO and CMSG_SIGNED_ENCODE_INFO structure</li>
<li>I create a CRYPT_ATTRIBUTE for the ocsp date and specifies it in the CMSG_SIGNER_ENCODE_INFO structure</li>
<li>I then call CryptMsgCalculateEncodedLength to get the size</li>
<li>CryptMsgOpenToEncode with CMSG_SIGNED as the message type</li>
<li>CryptMsgUpdate, to insert my content into the message</li>
<li>CryptMsgGetParam with CMSG_CONTENT_PARAM to get the encoded blob</li>
<li>CryptMsgClose, I'm done with the message for now.</li>
</ul>

<p>I open the message again to get the CMSG_ENCRYPTED_DIGEST, which is sent to a TSA and the result is added as an unaunthenticated attribute using CryptMsgControl.</p>

<p>I'm using this to sign signature tags in Adobe. So when there is no authenticated attributes, I receive three green check from Adobe:</p>

<ol>
<li>The document has not been modified...</li>
<li>The document is signed by the current user</li>
<li>The signature includes an embedded timestamp (and the timestamp is validate)</li>
</ol>

<p>But as soon as the authenticated attribute is added the signer's identity is invalidated and the timestamp data in incorrect. The CMSG_COMPUTED_HASH_PARAM when authenticated attributes are added and when not, differs. Should this not be the same? Since the document digest is of the content of the document and not of the authenticated attribute.</p>

<p>Is there another way to add authenticated attributes? I've tried to add it as a signer using CryptMsgControl, but that did not help either...</p>
","<p>how about this step on adding the authenticated attributes for signing, example time stamping,</p>

<pre><code>CryptEncodeObject(PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING, szOID_RSA_signingTime, &amp;curtime, pTime, &amp;szTime);
pTime = (BYTE *)LocalAlloc(GPTR, szTime);
CryptEncodeObject(PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING, szOID_RSA_signingTime, &amp;curtime, pTime, &amp;szTime);
time_blob.cbData = szTime;
time_blob.pbData = pTime;
attrib[0].pszObjId = szOID_RSA_signingTime;

","<p>So, I did end up switching my project to .netstandard 1.4 and using Portable.BouncyCastle to decode the Cms created on the server side.</p>

<p>Here is the code that I used to decode the Cms. I'm sort of trusting that this is also checking the signature since there is no explicit method for doing that in BouncyCastle like there is via the framework code i.e. CheckSignature().</p>

<pre><code>var cmsParser = new Org.BouncyCastle.Cms.CmsSignedDataParser(dataBytes);

<pre><code>cmsParser.GetSignedContent().Drain();
var certStore = cmsParser.GetCertificates(""Collection"");
var signerInfos = cmsParser.GetSignerInfos();
var signers = signerInfos.GetSigners();

foreach (SignerInformation signer in signers)
{
    var certCollection = certStore.GetMatches(signer.SignerID);
    foreach (Org.BouncyCastle.X509.X509Certificate cert in certCollection)
    {
        var result = signer.Verify(cert);
        if (!result)
        {

        }
    }

<p>I'm not 100% sure if this is all I need to do but my client's will communicate via SSL and they are using an HMAC auth with an appId and client secret so I'm not so concerned with in transit issues. I'm basically transferring a ""license"" file and I want to make sure the contents are not tampered with after it has been saved on the client device.</p>

<p>The pkcs7 structure should be fine as I've extracted it from the PE file <code>iexlorer.exe</code> and from its chain I've extracted the root certificate, and refer to it as a trusted one. </p>

<p>What am I doing wrong here ? </p>

<p>P.s. 
To observe the same failures I did, I've uploaded the files to the following links : </p>

<p><a href=""https://ufile.io/vrqpt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://ufile.io/vrqpt</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://ufile.io/ajgex"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://ufile.io/ajgex</a></p>
","<p>Your uploaded example files have a few properties which prevent it from being verified.</p>

<p>First, the certificate of the signer in the <code>p7</code> file has expired on <code>Apr 24 22:33:39 2014 GMT</code>. You will have to disable checking of the expiration date if you want to verify the chain. This is programmatically done with the verify flag <code>X509_V_FLAG_NO_CHECK_TIME</code>, or the option <code>-no_check_time</code> for the OpenSSL <code>smime -verify</code> tool.</p>

<p>Then, your ""root of trust"", found in the <code>mroot.pem.cer</code> file is not the right one. You extracted the <code>Microsoft Time-Stamp PCA</code> certificate whereas the signer of the <code>p7</code> file chains up to the <code>Microsoft Code Signing PCA</code> certificate.</p>

<p>Let's say that you extract that correct certificate to a file called <code>trust.pem.cer</code>. That certificate is not self-signed: its issuer is the <code>Microsoft Root Certificate Authority</code>. You will have to indicate that you are using a so-called partial chain if you want such a certificate to be at the end of the chain.  This is programmatically done with the verify flag <code>X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN</code>, or the option <code>-partial_chain</code> for the OpenSSL <code>smime -verify</code> tool.</p>

<p>Also, it looks like the OpenSSL implementation of the PKCS7 verification requires your certificate to include the extended key usage of S/MIME signing, which your certificate does not include. It looks like this can be worked around by setting a code-signing purpose for the OpenSSL <code>X509_STORE</code>. The OpenSSL <code>smime -verify</code> tool does not expose this kind of setting so you will have to do this programmatically by setting the <code>XKU_CODE_SIGN</code> purpose. <code>XKU</code> stands for eXtended Key Usage and, as a caveat, the OpenSSL documentation around that is virtually non-existent. You have to thoroughly test this if you decide to use it.</p>

<p>The piece of code below (return code checking omitted) successfully verifies the certificate chain in your <code>p7</code> file, but not the signature:</p>

<pre><code>BIO *bio_p7 = BIO_new_file(""p7"", ""r"");
PKCS7 *p7 = d2i_PKCS7_bio(bio_p7, NULL);
X509_STORE *store = X509_STORE_new();
X509_LOOKUP *lookup = X509_STORE_add_lookup(store, X509_LOOKUP_file());
X509_LOOKUP_load_file(lookup, ""trust.pem.cer"", X509_FILETYPE_PEM);
X509_STORE_set_purpose(store, XKU_CODE_SIGN); /* see caveat above */
X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags(
    X509_STORE_get0_param(store),
    X509_V_FLAG_NO_CHECK_TIME | X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN);
int retcode = PKCS7_verify(p7, NULL, store, NULL, NULL, PKCS7_NOSIGS);
</code></pre>

<p>For a verification of the signature itself: the function <a href=""https://sourceforge.net/p/osslsigncode/osslsigncode/ci/master/tree/osslsigncode.c#l2063"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">verify_pe_pkcs7() in <code>osslsigncode.c</code></a> gives example code to do that. Its <code>PKCS7_verify()</code> invocation does not verify the certificate chain, but it does check the signature. This requires extraction of a hash which is stored in a Microsoft-specific element in the p7 of a type called <code>SpcIndirectDataContent</code>, as pointed out by @dave_thompson_085 below. It is possible to verify the signature that was taken over that hash. For a complete verification, you will also need to re-calculate the hash over the PE file itself and compare it to the hash value found in the p7. </p>

<p>This answer is based on OpenSSL 1.1.1. Just now, I realize that you are using libressl, which is based on a (much) older version of OpenSSL. It might not work in your case. For example, for my version of libressl, the <code>smime -verify</code> tool does not support the <code>partial_chain</code> and <code>no_time_check</code> options because those were introduced in the OpenSSL 1.1.0 branch.</p>

<p>The output is invariably:</p>

<p>For this to work, I need the originally signed hash of the document from a trusted source, which in my case I have. Does this still verify that the signature made over the hash is correct?</p>
","<p>From </p>

<pre><code>PdfPKCS7 pkcs7Out = new PdfPKCS7(pkcs7Bytes, PdfName.Adbe_pkcs7_detached, provider.getName());

isValidSignature = pkcs7Out.verify();
</code></pre>

<p>you cannot expect a proper validation result of the signature: This <code>PdfPKCS7</code> only knows the CMS signature container, the signature <strong>SubFilter</strong>, and the security provider to provide algorithm implementations. Thus, it has no information on the very PDF the signature actually is meant to sign. So that piece of code has no means to validate the signature in question, in particular not whether it properly signs its alleged signed data!</p>

<p>If you want to validate the signature using that <code>PdfPKCS7</code> object, you have to finish initializing it so it does have the required information from the PDF.</p>

<p>To see what is required have a look at the <code>SignatureUtil</code> method <code>verifySignature</code>:</p>

<pre><code>PdfPKCS7 pk = null;
if (sub.equals(PdfName.Adbe_x509_rsa_sha1)) {
    PdfString cert = signature.getPdfObject().getAsString(PdfName.Cert);
    if (cert == null)
        cert = signature.getPdfObject().getAsArray(PdfName.Cert).getAsString(0);
    pk = new PdfPKCS7(PdfEncodings.convertToBytes(contents.getValue(), null), cert.getValueBytes(), provider);
}
else
    pk = new PdfPKCS7(PdfEncodings.convertToBytes(contents.getValue(), null), sub, provider);
updateByteRange(pk, signature);
PdfString date = signature.getDate();
if (date != null)
    pk.setSignDate(PdfDate.decode(date.toString()));
String signName = signature.getName();
pk.setSignName(signName);
String reason = signature.getReason();
if (reason != null)
    pk.setReason(reason);
String location = signature.getLocation();
if (location != null)
    pk.setLocation(location);
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, you have to </p>

<ul>
<li>update the digest of the signed data like <code>SignatureUtil.updateByteRange</code> does; this is the step that informs the <code>PdfPKCS7</code> object about the actually signed data to allow actual validation; and</li>
<li>copy several pieces of information from the signature dictionary to the <code>PdfPKCS7</code> object; for validation purposes in particular the signing time may be of interest.</li>

I also tried to manage files using std::fstream, but result is the same. Maybe the way I'm writing file to disk is wrong?</p>
","<p>Are you trying to compute the length of <code>pkcsContent</code> with <code>strlen</code> (this is my guess since you're null-terminating the buffer in <code>MyReadFil</code>)? You can't do that because PKCS#7 is binary data and it can contain 0 anywhere.</p>

<p>Am i doing it wrong?</p>
","<p>In your first step you create a signature field with an automatically generated name:</p>

<pre><code>sap.setVisibleSignature(new Rectangle(100, 100, 200, 200), 1, null);
</code></pre>

<p>Confer the associated JavaDocs:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>/**
 * Sets the signature to be visible. It creates a new visible signature field.
 * @param pageRect the position and dimension of the field in the page
 * @param page the page to place the field. The fist page is 1
 * @param fieldName the field name or &lt;CODE&gt;null&lt;/CODE&gt; to generate automatically a new field name
 */
public void setVisibleSignature(Rectangle pageRect, int page, String fieldName)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Later on, though, you act as if the signature field name was ""}"":</p>

<pre><code>MakeSignature.signDeferred(reader, ""}"", os, external);
</code></pre>

<p>Confer the associated JavaDocs:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>/**
 * Signs a PDF where space was already reserved.
 * @param reader the original PDF
 * @param fieldName the field to sign. It must be the last field
 * @param outs the output PDF
 * @param externalSignatureContainer the signature container doing the actual signing. Only the

 * @throws GeneralSecurityException 
 */
public static void signDeferred(PdfReader reader, String fieldName, OutputStream outs, ExternalSignatureContainer externalSignatureContainer) throws DocumentException, IOException, GeneralSecurityException

</blockquote>

<p>Thus, change your code to make those names match, i.e. either use a fixed name you know not to be used by some other form field in the document or query the generated name used by iText using the <code>PdfSignatureAppearance</code> method</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>/**

  -sign -binary or equivalent)  this changes the signed content, and verify fails.  Content that was canonical as sent (originally

  output without determining if sender changed it.</p>

From this <a href=""https://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/DigSig/Acrobat_DigitalSignatures_in_PDF.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">document</a> I have written this PHP code below. </p>

<p>What it does is: </p>

<ol>
<li>Extract the PKCS7 code (it works because I can get the details from Openssl)</li>
<li>Compute the SHA256 hash of the document. </li>
</ol>

<p>At the end I has a PKCS7 file and a SHA256. </p>

<p>Now, I would like to verify my signature against my PKCS7 file. How can I do this? I initially looked to the <code>digest_enc_alg</code>/<code>sha256WithRSAEncryption</code>/<code>enc_digest</code>, but it seems it is not what I am looking about. </p>

</code></pre>

<p>So inspired from <a href=""http://qistoph.blogspot.com/2012/01/manual-verify-pkcs7-signed-data-with.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> I did the following: </p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# Extract Digest (SHA256)

    perl -ne 'print $1 + $2 if /(\d+):d=\d\s+hl=(\d).*?256 prim.*HEX DUMP/m')

# Extract Public key

    tac | sed '/-----BEGIN/q' | tac &gt; client.pem

# Verify the signature
openssl rsautl -verify -pubin -inkey client.pub.pem &lt; signed-sha256.bin &gt; verified.bin

# Get Hash and compare with the computed hash from the PDF
openssl asn1parse -inform der -in verified.bin | grep -Po '\[HEX DUMP\]:\K\w+$' | tr A-F a-f

</code></pre>

<p>So unfortunately by two hashes do not match...</p>

<p>Am I missing something?</p>
","<p>The <a href=""http://qistoph.blogspot.com/2012/01/manual-verify-pkcs7-signed-data-with.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blog</a> you were <em>inspired from</em> shows the following graphics to explain the PKCS#7 signature container structure</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QTSO2.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QTSO2.png"" alt=""screen shot""></a></p>

<p>Actually, though, this represents only the most simple structure defined by PKCS#7. If you look at the <code>SignerInfo</code> specification (<code>content - signerInfos - SignerInfo</code>), you'll see</p>



<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>   SignerInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
     version Version,
     issuerAndSerialNumber IssuerAndSerialNumber,
     digestAlgorithm DigestAlgorithmIdentifier,
     authenticatedAttributes
       [0] IMPLICIT Attributes OPTIONAL,
     digestEncryptionAlgorithm
       DigestEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier,
     encryptedDigest EncryptedDigest,
     unauthenticatedAttributes
       [1] IMPLICIT Attributes OPTIONAL }

<p><em>(<a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2315#section-9.2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 2315 section 9.2 ""SignerInfo type""</a>)</em></p>

<p>In particular there are the OPTIONAL <code>authenticatedAttributes</code> which you don't find in the sketch above. But in any current signature profile to be taken seriously these <code>authenticatedAttributes</code> (aka signed attributes) are actually required!</p>

<p>Furthermore, if there are <code>authenticatedAttributes</code> in a PKCS#7 signature container signer info object, the encrypted digest is <em>not</em> the digest of the document data but instead the digest of the <code>authenticatedAttributes</code> structure. In this case the digest of the document data is stored as the value of a specific signed attribute, the ""messageDigest"" attribute. Thus, in this case you try to extract the wrong value to compare the document digest with.</p>

<p>For example in case of the example document you shared in your <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/54361974/1729265"">follow-up question</a> there are <code>authenticatedAttributes</code>, so the inspiring blog led you astray.</p>

"49451395","Swift (Linux): Extract CMS/PKCS#7 Certs and Validate Container Signature?","<p>I am writing a set of services in Swift 4 that will run on Linux.  One of the things I need to do is receive a payload that is digitally signed using the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) format, extract the certificate used to sign it, and then validate the signature.  I know that Swift on Linux doesn't contain a Security or CommonCrypto framework for this sort of thing, so I've linked in OpenSSL to try and help with this.  I'm about 2 years removed from my C/C++ programming days, so I readily admit I'm in over my head on this portion of the code.</p>

<p>I have 2 simple classes to act as wrappers for OpenSSL <code>BIO</code> and <code>PKCS7</code> data structures.  They look like this:</p>

<pre><code>import Foundation
import OpenSSL

public final class BIOWrapper {

    public var bio = BIO_new(BIO_s_mem())

    public init(data: Data) {
        data.withUnsafeBytes { pointer -&gt; Void in
            BIO_write(self.bio, pointer, Int32(data.count))
        }
    }

    public init() {}

    deinit {
        BIO_free(self.bio)
    }
}

public final class PKCS7Wrapper {

    public var pkcs7: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;PKCS7&gt;

    public init(pkcs7: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;PKCS7&gt;) {
        self.pkcs7 = pkcs7
    }

    deinit {
        PKCS7_free(self.pkcs7)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am able to successfully extract the PKCS#7 container data and validate that the data type code value is <code>NID_pkcs7_signed</code> using this code:</p>

<pre><code>let reqData = Data(bytes: reqBytes)
        guard reqData.count &gt; 0 else {
            print(""Empty request body"")
            return nil
        }

        let bioWrapper = BIOWrapper(data: reqData)
        guard let container = d2i_PKCS7_bio(bioWrapper.bio, nil) else {
            print(""No container"")
            return nil
        }

        let pkcs7Wrapper = PKCS7Wrapper(pkcs7: container)
        let dataTypeCode = OBJ_obj2nid((pkcs7Wrapper.pkcs7.pointee.d.sign).pointee.contents.pointee.type)
        print(""dataTypeCode : \(dataTypeCode)"")

        if dataTypeCode == NID_pkcs7_data {
            print(""GOT DATA!"")
        } else {
            print(""Didn't get data"")
            return nil
        }

       let pkcs7SignedTypeCode = OBJ_obj2nid(pkcs7Wrapper.pkcs7.pointee.type)
        if let signed = pkcs7SignedTypeCode == NID_pkcs7_signed {
            print(""Signed : \(signed)"")
        }
</code></pre>

<p>However, I've now reached a point where I'm stuck.  How can I obtain the X.509 certificate data from the PKCS#7 payload?  I can see that the <code>pkcs7Wrapper.pkcs7.pointee.d.sign.pointee.cert</code> data structure should contain the certificate chain data.  Its data type is <code>UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;stack_st_x509&gt;</code> and I think I can figure out the code to use OpenSSL's <code>PKCS7_verify</code> method once I get the X.509 certificate data in memory.  I just don't know how to do THAT part.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://swiftrien.blogspot.com/2015/05/osx-receipt-validation-in-swift-part-6.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this resource</a> that talks about validating receipts on OSX/iOS that touches on a lot of the same issues.  They obtain the X.509 certificate from the file system and pass the data into the <code>PKCS7_verify</code> method.  I just need to know how to get the certificate data from the PKCS#7 container to pass in.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me with this?  I recognize that calling C from Swift is not ideal, but in the absence of a good security/cryptography framework for Swift I'm not aware of any other options.</p>
","<p>The core part of the answer is in the code you linked:</p>

<pre><code>let store = X509_STORE_new()
X509_STORE_add_cert(store, appleRootX509)
OpenSSL_add_all_digests()
let result = PKCS7_verify(receiptPKCS7, nil, store, nil, nil, 0)
if result != 1 {
    log.atLevelDebug(id: 0, source: ""Main"", message: ""Receipt signature verification failed"")
    exit(errorCode)
}
</code></pre>

<p>What you seem to be missing is the fact that you don't have to extract the X509 certificate from the PKCS7 data yourself. The <code>PKCS7_verify</code> <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/crypto/PKCS7_verify.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">function will do it</a> as part of verification:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An attempt is made to locate all the signer's certificates, first looking in the certs parameter (if it is not NULL) and then looking in any certificates contained in the p7 structure itself. If any signer's certificates cannot be located the operation fails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore the only certificate you need to load yourself is the root certificate which you have observed they load from the file system in the <a href=""http://swiftrien.blogspot.com/2015/05/osx-receipt-validation-in-swift-part-6.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">linked code</a>.</p>

<p>If you still really need a Swift solution to extract the certificate out of the PKCS7 data for some reason, you will have to build an ASN.1 parser for PKCS7. Not sure if this is readily available for Swift, <a href=""https://gist.github.com/Jugale/2daaec0715d4f6d7347534d42bfa7110"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this simple code</a> is what a quick search yielded, and <a href=""https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/crypto/asymmetric_keys/pkcs7.asn1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> is a nice description of the PKCS7 data.</p>

If it's 8 bytes short I add <code>0x08 x 8</code>.<BR>
If it's 12 bytes short I add <code>0x0c x 12</code>.<BR>
I then encrypt the package using the multiple of 16 size, is this correct?</p>

<p>Next question is, do I send the full encoded packet, so it's a multiple of 16, or do I send the real length (before padding)?</p>

<p>Can anybody please help me to handle this issues?</p>
","<p>Please follow the following steps. Hope it will help you because it is tested.
<br><br>
<strong>Step 01:</strong> <br>
Read byte array from file or convert data object to byte array. <br>
Sample Code: <br></p>

<pre><code>FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);
byte fileContent[] = new byte[(int)file.length()];
fis.read(fileContent);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 02:</strong> <br>
create CMSSignedData object from the byte array. <br>
Sample Code: </p>

<pre><code>CMSSignedData data = new CMSSignedData(fileContent);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 03:</strong> <br>
Get CertStore from the CMSSignedData. <br>
Sample Code:<br></p>

<pre><code>CertStore certs = data.getCertificatesAndCRLs(""Collection"", ""BC"");
</code></pre>

<p>Be sure to add BouncyCastleProvider in Security at the first:</p>

<pre><code>Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 04:</strong> <br>
Get Certificate collection using Signer Information. <br>
Sample Code:</p>

<pre><code>SignerInformation signer = (SignerInformation) i.next();
Collection&lt;? extends Certificate&gt; certCollection = certs.getCertificates(signer.getSID());
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 05:</strong> <br>
Verify sign from signer for each certificate. <br>
Sample Code:</p>

<pre><code>if (signer.verify(new JcaSimpleSignerInfoVerifierBuilder().setProvider(""BC"").build(cert)) ) 
{   
     }
</code></pre>

<p><br> <br>
Please check that, to fulfuill your objective, you have completed above steps.
<br><br>
I am guessing, either you are making CMSSignedData from wrong data input or the dependent libraries are conflicting each other (<em>most probable cause</em>). I have used <strong>bcprov-jdk16-1.46.jar</strong> and <strong>bcmail-jdk16-1.46.jar</strong> to complete all the tasks.</p>

"46689478","Sign pdf asynchronously using digest","<p>I'm trying to do the following setup for signing pdfs, broken down into asynchronous steps between a client and a server:</p>

<ol>
<li>A server receives a pdf and computes it's digest.</li>
<li>Server sends the digest to a client.</li>
<li>Client signs the hash at a later time.</li>
<li>Client sends the signature to server.</li>
<li>Server embeds the signature into the pdf.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm basing myself mainly in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29251895/pdf-signature-digest"">PDF Signature digest</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41767351/create-pkcs7-signature-from-file-digest"">Create pkcs7 signature from file digest</a></p>

<p>The second question allowed me to write most of the code, however I'm getting that the integrity of the file has been compromised. I can't seem to serialize the intermediary pdf for embedding the signature later (to make sure no timestamps are altered, etc). But from the first SO question, it seems to be a harder problem than I thought. Can it actually be done? </p>

<p>I'm using pdfbox.</p>

<p>Server code:</p>

<pre><code>        PDDocument document = PDDocument.load(documentFile);
        PDSignature signature = new PDSignature();
        signature.setFilter(PDSignature.FILTER_ADOBE_PPKLITE);
        signature.setSubFilter(PDSignature.SUBFILTER_ADBE_PKCS7_DETACHED);
        signature.setName(""Example User"");
        signature.setLocation(""Los Angeles, CA"");
        signature.setReason(""Testing"");
        Calendar date = Calendar.getInstance();
        signature.setSignDate(date);
        document.addSignature(signature);

        ExternalSigningSupport externalSigningSupport = document.saveIncrementalForExternalSigning(null);

        byte[] content = IOUtils.toByteArray(externalSigningSupport.getContent());
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA256"", new BouncyCastleProvider());
        byte[] digest = md.digest(content); // this is sent to client
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm basically doing is sending that digest to the client to sign and then on the server redoing the above steps and setting the client signature:</p>

<pre><code>        ExternalSigningSupport externalSigning = document.saveIncrementalForExternalSigning(fos);
        externalSigning.setSignature(encodedSignature); // encodedSignature is received from client and computed based on the digest sent by the server
</code></pre>

<p>This setup ends up with the integrity of the file being corrupted, since I'm creating a new PDSignature once I have the <code>encodedSignature</code> on the server to embed it. Is there a way to serialize the PDDocument created after calling addSignature, so I can later deserialize it on the server and add the client's  signature?</p>
","<blockquote>

<p>If you want those <em>above steps</em> to generate identical documents, you need to</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure the inputs to those steps are identical and</li>
<li>provide the same revision id seed value.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do so, the outputs of the <em>above steps</em> are identical as is required for your task.</p>

<h3>Making sure the inputs are identical</h3>

<p>One step of your <em>above steps</em> is prone to result in different inputs:</p>

<pre><code>Calendar date = Calendar.getInstance();
signature.setSignDate(date);
</code></pre>

<p>To guarantee identical inputs, you have to determine <code>date</code> only once and use that single value every time you execute those steps for the same signing transaction.</p>

<h3>Providing the same revision id seed value</h3>

<p>As recommended by the specification, PDFBox attempts to give each PDF revision its unique ID. In the case at hand, though, we need the same revision ID both times the <em>above steps</em> are executed.</p>

<p>Fortunately, PDFBox allows us to provide the seed value it uses to make the revision ID unique enough. </p>

<p>As we don't want to same revision ID all the time we sign the same document but merely during the current signing transaction, we should use the same seed value only in the same transaction. As the seed value is a long, we can simply use the time in milliseconds corresponding to the <code>date</code> already discussed above, i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>pdDocument.setDocumentId(date.getTimeInMillis());

<p>here is my command:</p>

<p><code>openssl pkcs7 -inform DER -verify -noverify -in file.docx.p7s -out file.docx</code></p>

<p>is this possible to do a file verification and p7s signature using openssl?</p>

<p><strong>-- edit...</strong></p>

<p>Just to let you know. I got an p7s file with an pdf file. I'd like to know how to validate that.</p>
","<p>Finally, I understand a litte bit about p7s file. This is pretty common to securing e-mail messages, but, I can use p7s files, that contains an PKCS#7 detached signatures with an certificate, to ensure the veracity of a file.</p>

<p>So, I sepparate my explanation, in parts to get easy to explain what I'm doing here. Please, correct me if there's something wrong!</p>

<p><strong>First, Initial Config:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>create private key and certificate</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365

<li>Add to trusted certificates, to let openssl allow your certificate as valid</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>sudo cp cert.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
sudo update-ca-certificates
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Second, Creating an p7s File</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Run the command below to sign an pdf file, with private key, certificate and generate an p7s file that contains a signed hash of file and the certificate </li>
</ol>

<pre><code>openssl smime -sign -in test.pdf -inkey key.pem -outform DER -binary -signer cert.pem -out test.pdf.p7s

<p><strong>Finally, Verifying p7s File</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Now, I have to extract pkcs7 signature from p7s file</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>openssl pkcs7 -inform der -in test.pdf.p7s -out test.pdf.pkcs7
</code></pre>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>After that, I extracted the certificate from pkcs7 file</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -in test.pdf.pkcs7 -out test.pdf.pkcs7.cert
</code></pre>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Then, verify pkcs7, certificate and file together. Just to validate if that file belongs to that certificate</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>openssl smime -verify -binary -inform PEM -in test.pdf.pkcs7 -content test.pdf -certfile test.pdf.pkcs7.cert -nointern -noverify &gt; /dev/null

","<p>I don't know how to fix your code, but I have a couple of <code>openssl</code> commands and a python script to solve your task:</p>

<p>You can run the following command to get the list of all serial numbers
of the recipient keys in an encrypted file <code>MYMAIL</code>:</p>

<pre><code>openssl smime -pk7out -inform DER -in MYMAIL \
    | openssl pkcs7 -noout -print \
    | grep serial
</code></pre>

<p>This will print the serial number as decimal numbers of all recipients, i.e. serial numbers of certificates for which the file <code>MYMAIL</code> has been encrypted for. For a given certificate file <code>CERTFILE.0</code>, the command</p>

<pre><code>openssl x509 -in CERTFILE.0 -serial -noout
</code></pre>

<p>prints its serial number as a hexadecimal number. Now, you can to combine the serial numbers of the certificates you have with the serial numbers mentioned in <code>MYMAIL</code>.</p>

<p>I've wrote a python script that does this and that can be used to replace the default <a href=""http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/#smime-decrypt-command"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">smime_decrypt_command</a> in mutt, such that when decrypting an E-Mail, the correct private key is chosen for decryption: <a href=""https://github.com/t-wissmann/dotfiles/blob/master/utils/smime-recipient-list.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/t-wissmann/dotfiles/blob/master/utils/smime-recipient-list.py</a>

<p>Also tried this:</p>

<pre><code>openssl smime -encrypt -nosigs -in msg.txt -out out.txt -passin pass:SOMEPASS  certificate.pem

<p>and I receive this which is clearly different <code>smime-type</code> in header:</p>

"53527693","How to convert PEM certificate chain to PKCS7 in native Go?","<p>I am looking for any practical method for converting a <strong>PEM</strong>-encoded x509 certificate chain into <strong>PKCS7</strong> format in the Go language.</p>

<p>This openssl command line illustrates what I am trying to achieve in native Go.</p>

<pre><code>openssl crl2pkcs7 -nocrl -certfile certificate-chain.pem &gt; pkcs7.pem
</code></pre>

<p>I am able to run the openssl command line from within a Go program using the <code>exec</code> package, but I am looking for an efficient solution in Go.</p>

<p>The input file contains a sequence of certificates in PEM format, starting with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n and <code>base64</code> encoded data.  The desired output needs to be in PKCS7 format, starting with -----BEGIN PKCS7-----.</p>

<p>I am looking for an efficient solution, because I am not actually reading and writing files, but handling lots of certificates as strings in memory.</p>

<p>Any suggestions appreciated.</p>
","<p>First of all, just to be clear, both the input and output you are requesting are in PEM format. The input is a sequence of PEM-encoded X509 certificates, and the output you request is a PEM-encoded PKCS#7 degenerate ""certs only"" structure. OpenSSL can output the raw ASN.1 DER for the PKCS#7 structure if you give it the <code>-outform DER</code> option, but it will PEM-encode its output by default.</p>

<p>There are a number of Go packages out there that can build this kind of PKCS#7 structure. The following example uses <a href=""https://godoc.org/github.com/fullsailor/pkcs7"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>.</p>

<p>If you have your input in a PEM-encoded string, and you want your output to be a PEM-encoded string, then the basic steps are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Extract each PEM-block from your input, decode it, and collect its raw bytes.</li>
<li>Create a PKCS7 structure from those bytes.</li>
<li>PEM-encode that structure to an array of bytes.</li>
<li>Convert that array of bytes to a string.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's a simple example:</p>

<pre><code>package main

import (
    ""encoding/pem""
    ""fmt""
    ""log""

    ""github.com/fullsailor/pkcs7""
)

var certChain = `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

","<p>I stumbled over your post, because I wanted to achieve something very similar: sign a message in an UWP app and verifying the signature in my WCF Service.

            Certificate = cert,
            HashAlgorithmName = HashAlgorithmNames.Sha256
        };

        var signature = await CmsDetachedSignature.GenerateSignatureAsync(ms.AsInputStream(), new[] { si }, null);
        return CryptographicBuffer.EncodeToBase64String(signature);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>WCF:</p>

<pre><code>public static bool Verify(System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2 cert, string messageToCheck, string signature) {

    var ci = new ContentInfo(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(messageToCheck));
    var cms = new SignedCms(ci, true);
    cms.Decode(Convert.FromBase64String(signature));

    // Check whether the expected certificate was used for the signature.

<p>Could you please help me solve this compilation issue?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
","<p>The problem is that <code>CMSSignedData.getCertificates</code> returns an untyped <code>Store</code>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.bouncycastle.org/docs/pkixdocs1.5on/org/bouncycastle/cms/CMSSignedData.html#getCertificates()"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.bouncycastle.org/docs/pkixdocs1.5on/org/bouncycastle/cms/CMSSignedData.html#getCertificates()</a></p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>public org.bouncycastle.util.Store getCertificates()
</code></pre>

<p>The Scala compiler interprets this is <code>Store[_]</code>, which is shorthand for the existential type <code>Store[?0] forSome { type ?0 }</code> (see the answer to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3293318/what-is-scala-trying-to-tell-me-and-how-do-i-fix-this-required-java-util-lis"">this</a> question), i.e. the <code>Store</code> is parameterized with some specific, arbitrary type and not with <code>Any</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally, <code>SignerId</code> extends an untyped <code>Selector</code>.</p>

<p>Now, the following code causes a type mismatch since the type parameter values for <code>certStore</code> (<code>Store[_]</code>) and <code>signer.getSID</code> (<code>Selector[_]</code>) are not compatible.</p>

<pre class=""lang-scala prettyprint-override""><code>val certs = certStore.getMatches(signer.getSID)
</code></pre>

<p>To resolve the problem, it should help to explicitly cast <code>certStore</code> to <code>Store[X509CertificateHolder]</code> and <code>signerId</code> to <code>Selector[X509CertificateHolder]</code> (not tested):</p>

<pre class=""lang-scala prettyprint-override""><code>val certStore = signedData.getCertificates.
  asInstanceOf[Store[X509CertificateHolder]]

val certs = certStore.getMatches(
  signer.getSID.asInstanceOf[Selector[X509CertificateHolder]])

<p>I'm trying to implement my own version of <code>EnvelopedCms.Decrypt()</code>, so that I can use the certificate operations of Azure Key Vault to <code>UnwrapKey</code> and/or <code>Decrypt</code> a PKCS#7 message (CMS Object) in a correct way. I use EnevelopedCms in .Net to <code>Decode</code> the message, then I try to <code>Decrypt</code> the <code>EnvelopedCms.ContentInfo.Content</code>.</p>

<p>This is what I try to do;</p>

    var contentInfo = new ContentInfo(bytes);
    var envelopedCms = new EnvelopedCms(contentInfo);
    envelopedCms.Decode(bytes);

<p>I was hoping it could be that easy, but it gives me the following error;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unable to decrypt specified value with this key.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read something about octets in RFC 2315, so maybe the stream (byte-array) needs some reordering before I decrypt. Do I need to unwrap some symmetric key to decrypt the real payload? I'm on thin ice here.</p>

<p>I'm not a cryptography professional so I might have missed something obvious, too. I was hoping someone knew what to do in this case as I really want to keep my certificates inside the Key Vault (HSM)</p>
","<p>CMS envelope contents are encrypted using a session key, and this key is encrypted with each recipients (there can be many) public key before transmission.</p>

<p>What you need is to extract your recipient's encrypted session key, and unwrap it with the private key stored in key vault. I'm not near Visual Studio right now, but here is the pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>// Extract the first (and often only) receiver's encrypted session key
var key = envelopedCms.Receivers[0].EncryptionKey; 
// Unwrap the sessionKey using the receiver's private key stored in key vault:
var sessionKey = (await keyVaultClient.Unwrap(uri, ""certificatename"", key)).Result;

<p>Finally, using the sessionKey, you can decrypt the envelope contents (ContentInfo.Content). The encryption type is specified in the envelope's encryption algorithm-property.</p>

<h3>In short</h3>

<p>Your code hashes the signed attributes twice. Simply don't hash the bytes returned by <code>signatureContainer.getAuthenticatedAttributeBytes(hash, null, null, CryptoStandard.CMS)</code> in <code>GetHashOfPdf</code> but instead use the authenticated attribute bytes themselves as return value.</p>

<h3>In detail</h3>

<p>Analyzing the signature in your example PDF it turns out that</p>

<ul>
<li><p>indeed the hash of the signed attributes is </p>

<pre><code>92587A086A7B0D4CDACADEB612EB22AA3AF504509C4D94F85DD827301ABB41E6
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>but the hash in the RSA encrypted <code>DigestInfo</code> object of the signature is</p>

<pre><code>1DC7CAA50D88243327A9D928D5FB4F1A61CBEFF9E947D393DDA705BD61B67F25
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>which turns out to be the hash of the before mentioned hash of the signed attributes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, your</p>

<pre><code>var signature = signer.sign(toBeSignedHash);
</code></pre>

<p>call appears to hash the <code>toBeSignedHash</code> value again.</p>

<p>The most simple fix would be to replace</p>

<pre><code>byte[] signatureHash = signatureContainer.getAuthenticatedAttributeBytes(hash, null, null, CryptoStandard.CMS);
result = DigestAlgorithms.Digest(new MemoryStream(signatureHash), ""SHA256"");
</code></pre>

<p>by</p>

<pre><code>result = signatureContainer.getAuthenticatedAttributeBytes(hash, null, null, CryptoStandard.CMS);
</code></pre>

<p>in <code>GetHashOfPdf</code> to have only <code>signer.sign</code> do the hashing.</p>

<h3>Analyzing such issues</h3>

<p>In a comment you asked</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how did you figure all this out :)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, yours is not the first question with a customized iText signing process resulting in errors or at least unwanted profiles.</p>

<p>In the course of the analysis of those questions the first step usually is to extract the embedded signature container and inspect it in an ASN.1 viewer.</p>

<p>In case of your PDF the main result of that inspection was that the signature as such looked ok and that your signed attributes don't contain any variable data.</p>

<p><sup><em>If there had been some variable data (e.g. a signing time attribute) in them, a candidate for the cause of the issue would have been that you build the signed attributes twice, once explicitly in <code>GetHashOfPdf</code>, once implicitly in <code>EmbedSignature</code>, with different values for the variable data. But as mentioned above, this was not the case.</em></sup></p>

<p>The next step here was to actually check the hashes involved. Checking the document hash is simple, one calculates the signed byte range hash and compares with the value of the <code>MessageDigest</code> signed attribute, cf. the <a href=""https://github.com/mkl-public/testarea-itext5/blob/master/src/test/java/mkl/testarea/itext5/signature/ExtractHash.java#L112"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ExtractHash</a> test <code>testSotnSignedpdf</code> (in Java).</p>

<p><sup><em>The result for your PDF turned out to be ok.</em></sup></p>

<p>The following step was to inspect the signature container more thoroughly. In this context I once started to write some checks but did not get very far, cf. the <a href=""https://github.com/mkl-public/testarea-itext5/blob/master/src/main/java/mkl/testarea/signature/analyze/SignatureAnalyzer.java#L58"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SignatureAnalyzer</a> class. I extended it a bit for the test of the hash of the signed attributes making use of the signature algorithm you used, the old <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-8.2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5</a>: In contrast to many other signature algorithms, this one allows to trivially extract the signed hash.</p>

<p><sup><em>Here the result for your PDF turned out not to be ok, the hash of the signed attributes differed from the signed hash.</em></sup></p>

<p>There are two often seen causes for a mismatch here,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>either the signed attributes are signed with a wrong encoding (it must be the regular DER encoding, not some arbitrary BER encoding and in particular not an encoding with the implicit tag the value stored in the signature has --- even larger players do this wrong sometimes, e.g. Docusign, cf. <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/tracker/browse/DSS-1343"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DSS-1343</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>or the hash was somehow transformed during signing (e.g. the hash is base64 encoded or hashed again).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><sup><em>As it turned out, the latter was the case here, the hash was hashed again.</em></sup></p>

<p>Now I know I am either doing in wrong way or there is something I have missed out. My question is </p>

<ol>
<li>Is there a way out for generating .sig file with signed xml?</li>
<li>Is it possible for large xml file in PKCS7?</li>
</ol>

<p>As my requriement are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The digital signature will be generated as a part of PKCS7 envelop as a plain bytes. A PKCS7 envelop will contain the certificate used for signing as well as the digital signature itself.</li>
<li>The PKCS7 envelop will not be base-64 encoded. It will not contain any start aend identifiers. The plain PKCS7 envelop which is a sequence of bytes will be written into the .sig file.</li>
<li>The digital signature will be generated using SHA-2(512bits) algorithm for message digest and RSA-2048 algorithm for encryption</li>

"47380716","Information used to verify PKCS#7 signature in Java","<p>I have 2 files : a PKCS#7 signature and a file, which has been signed by this signature. My question is how can I verify this signature properly? Which data exactly should I use and extract from the PKCS7 in order to do that? I've heard that the order of the actions looks like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Check whether a certificate out of date or not</li>
<li>Check whether CA is out out of date or not</li>
<li>Check whether this public key is still valid</li>
<li>And perhaps extract the hash value from the attribute in PKCS7 file and check for equality to a hash file, which has been signed</li>
</ol>

<p>Am I correct? And how can I do it using Bouncy Castle? I've come across with this</p>

<pre><code>CMSSignedData data = new CMSSignedData(bytesArray)
</code></pre>

<p>But how can I check validality using only one method, if there is? This looks like overcomplicated - I should take every certificate, check it's expire date, writing custom method that does it.. And somehow check that the public key is still valid.. Is it possible to do it easier?</p>

<p>I can read the asn1 structure into a Bouncy Castle EnvelopedData. I can read all encryption parameters by hand, and I know the password to decrypt the data.</p>

<p>But how can I convert the EnvelopedData to something like CmsEnvelopedData (which has more functionality). If I feed the asn1 data to CmsEnvelopedData it fails with malformed data etc.</p>

<p>I also use Rebex, but that seems not to support the PasswordRecipientInfo structure (although they do implement the PBKDF2 key generation).</p>

<p>I did do all the decryption by hand, but do not end up with useful data, so I probably do make a mistake with all the 3Des decryption.</p>

I need to use blowfish,twofish and idea encryption algorithms in conjunction with iaik.pkcs.pkcs7.EnvelopedDataStream of IAIK library. Idea encryption algorithm Id is present in AlgorithmID class of IAIK but cant be implemented directly(probably because of variable key length). Blowfish is present as separate cipher class but I could not figure out a way to use it along with enveloped data(which is important because I will be using public key encryption method). I can actually encrypt using blowfish,then wrap using enveloped data and some algorithm such as aes and send this but the receiver won't have the algorithm info in that case. Secret key can be passed along with recepientInfo.</p>

    }
}

[...]
using (SHA256.Create())
{
    _signatureHash = SHA256.Create().ComputeHash(_signatureHash);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is wrong, this makes no sense.</p>

<h3>Injecting the wrong signature container</h3>

<p>You say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Requesting Esign services give response in PKCS7(CMS) format.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But instead of using the CMS signature container from the result as such, you try to build an own CMS container, injecting the Esign response CMS container as if it was a mere signed hash:</p>

<pre><code>XmlNodeList UserX509Certificate = xmlDoc.GetElementsByTagName(""UserX509Certificate"");
byte[] rawdat = Convert.FromBase64String(UserX509Certificate[0].InnerText);
var chain = new List&lt;Org.BouncyCastle.X509.X509Certificate&gt;
{
    Org.BouncyCastle.Security.DotNetUtilities.FromX509Certificate(new X509Certificate2(rawdat))
};
var signaturee = new PdfPKCS7(null, chain, ""SHA256"", false);
_signature = signaturee;

_signature.SetExternalDigest(Convert.FromBase64String(signature), null, ""RSA"");

byte[] encodedSignature = _signature.GetEncodedPKCS7(_hash, null, null, null, CryptoStandard.CMS);
</code></pre>

<p>According to your comments in the XML</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>    &lt;DocSignature error="""" id=""1"" sigHashAlgorithm=""SHA256""&gt;--Signature in base 64 in PKCS7(CMS)---&lt;/DocSignature&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>this <code>DocSignature</code> element contains the CMS signature container.</p>

<p>Thus, remove the code segment above and instead put the content of the <code>DocSignature</code> element (don't forget to base64 decode) into the <code>byte[] encodedSignature</code>. Now you can inject it into the prepared signature as before:</p>

<pre><code>IExternalSignatureContainer external = new MyExternalSignatureContainer(encodedSignature);

MakeSignature.SignDeferred(reader, ""sign1"", os, external);
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><em>After you fixed the issues above, two more became apparent:</em></p>

<h3>Using the wrong file mode</h3>

<p>You open the stream to write to like this:</p>

<pre><code>using (FileStream os = System.IO.File.OpenWrite(signedPdf))
</code></pre>

<p><code>File.OpenWrite</code> is <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.io.file.openwrite"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documented on docs.microsoft.com</a> to be</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>equivalent to the <code>FileStream(String, FileMode, FileAccess, FileShare)</code> constructor overload with file mode set to <code>OpenOrCreate</code>, the access set to <code>Write</code>, and the share mode set to <code>None</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The file mode <code>OpenOrCreate</code> in turn is <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.io.filemode#System_IO_FileMode_OpenOrCreate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documented</a> to specify</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>that the operating system should open a file if it exists; otherwise, a new file should be created.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, <em>if there already is a file at the given location, <strong>that file remains and you start writing into it.</em></strong></p>

<p>If the new file you create is longer than the old one, this is no problem, you eventually overwrite all the old file content and then the file grows to house the additional new content.</p>

<p>But if the new file you create is shorter than the old one, you have a problem: After the end of the new file there still is data from the old, longer file. Thus, your result is a hodgepodge of two files.</p>

<p>This happened in case of the example files you shared, your new content of ""signedPdf.pdf"" is only 175982 bytes long but there appears to have been some older file with that name which was 811986 bytes long. Thus, the ""signedPdf.pdf"" file you shared is 811986 bytes long, the first 175982 bytes containing the result of your operation, the rest data from some other file.</p>

<p>If you cut down your shared ""signedPdf.pdf"" file to its first 175982 bytes, the result looks much better!</p>

<p>To solve this issue you should use the file mode <code>Create</code> which is <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.io.filemode#System_IO_FileMode_Create"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documented</a> to be </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>equivalent to requesting that if the file does not exist, use <code>CreateNew</code>; otherwise, use <code>Truncate</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>using (FileStream os = new FileStream(signedPdf, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.None))
</code></pre>

<h3>An issue with your signing service - identity not yet valid</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, if you cut down your shared ""signedPdf.pdf"" file to its first 175982 bytes, the result looks much better! Unfortunately merely better, not yet good:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jqC5x.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jqC5x.png"" alt=""Signature Panel""></a></p>

<p>The reason for your ""identity has expired or is not yet valid"" becomes clearer by looking at the details:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/udL9B.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/udL9B.png"" alt=""Signature Properties""></a></p>

<p>I.e. the signing time claimed by the PDF is 09:47:59 UTC+1.</p>

<p>But looking at the certificate:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2HVyl.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2HVyl.png"" alt=""Certificate Viewer""></a></p>

<p>I.e. your certificate is valid not before 09:48:40 UTC+1.</p>

<p>Thus, the claimed signing time is more than half a minute before your user certificate became valid! This obviously cannot be accepted by a validator...</p>

<p>Apparently your signing service creates a short-time certificate for you on demand, valid from just then for half an hour. And the time at which you started creating the PDF signature is <em>not</em> in that interval.</p>

<p>I doubt they will change the design of the signing service for your requirements. Thus, you'll have to cheat a bit and use a signing time slightly in the future.</p>

<p>By default the signing time is set to the current by the <code>PdfSignatureAppearance</code> constructor, i.e. when this line executes:</p>

<pre><code>PdfSignatureAppearance appearance = stamper.SignatureAppearance;
</code></pre>

<p>Fortunately you can change this claimed signing time if you immediately use</p>

<pre><code>appearance.SignDate = [some other date time];
</code></pre>

<p>The date time you should use here has to be shortly (I'd propose not more than 5 minutes) after the time you will call your signing service.</p>

<p><strong>This of course implies that <em>you cannot arbitrarily wait until executing that service call.</em> As soon as you assigned the claimed signing time above, <em>you are committed to have successfully called your signing service shortly before that claimed time!</em></strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, if that signing service turns out to react only slowly or only after some retries, your software should definitively check the certificate in the signature container you retrieve from it and compare its validity interval with your claimed signing time. If the claimed signing time is not in that interval, start signing again!</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Now it became apparent that the <code>AllPagesSignatureContainer</code> you used was designed for a very special use case and still had to be adapted to your use case.</em></p>

<h3>Adapting the <code>AllPagesSignatureContainer</code> for append mode</h3>

<p>The <code>AllPagesSignatureContainer</code> implementation essentially copied from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/47762053/1729265"">this answer</a> worked fine when not signing in append mode but when signing in append mode it failed.</p>

<p>This at first was plausible because that class has to predict the object number that will be used for the signature value. This prediction depends on the exact use case, and switching on append mode changes this use case considerably. Thus, my advice in a comment was</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you need append mode, try to replace the</p>

<pre><code>PdfLiteral PRefLiteral = ...
</code></pre>
  
  <p>line in the <code>AllPagesSignatureContainer</code> by</p>

<pre><code>PdfLiteral PRefLiteral = new PdfLiteral((PRef.Number + reader.NumberOfPages) + "" 0 R"");
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In my tests that worked but in your tests it still didn't. An analysis of your signed file turned up the cause: My test file was using cross reference tables while yours was using cross reference streams.</p>

<h3>Adapting the <code>AllPagesSignatureContainer</code> for append mode and object streams</h3>

<p>iText in append mode uses the compression features of the original file, i.e. in case of your file it creates an object stream as soon as storing an indirect object that allows storage in an object stream.</p>

<p>In case of your file iText reserved an object number for the object stream, and it did so between the time the <code>AllPagesSignatureContainer</code> predicted the signature value object number and the time the signature value actually was generated. Thus, in your file the actual signature value object number was higher than the predicted number by 1.</p>

<p>To solve this for PDFs with cross reference streams, therefore, one can simply replace the <code>PdfLiteral PRefLiteral = ...</code> line by </p>

<pre><code>PdfLiteral PRefLiteral = new PdfLiteral((PRef.Number + reader.NumberOfPages + 1) + "" 0 R"");
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. by adding 1 to the originally predicted value. Unfortunately now the prediction is wrong for PDFs with cross reference tables...</p>

<p>A better way to fix this is to force iText to reserve an object number for the object stream for cross reference stream PDFs before predicting the signature value object number and then use the original prediction code. One way to do this is by creating and writing an indirect object right before the prediction, e.g. like this:</p>

<pre><code>stamper.Writer.AddToBody(new PdfNull(), stamper.Writer.PdfIndirectReference, true);

PdfIndirectReference PRef = stamper.Writer.PdfIndirectReference;
PdfLiteral PRefLiteral = new PdfLiteral((PRef.Number + reader.NumberOfPages) + "" 0 R"");

<p>Recently our Release Engineering department has tried to change the signing process to enable signature timestamp support (this thing: <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/time-of-signing.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/time-of-signing.html</a>), and since then the check above started to fail on Java 6 (only) -- my question ultimately will be why, but I have to give some details first. Release Engineering claim they use all the same certificates and all, the only change is they added ""-tsa <a href=""http://sha256timestamp.ws.symantec.com/sha256/timestamp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://sha256timestamp.ws.symantec.com/sha256/timestamp</a>"" to the jarsigner command they have.</p>

<p>I set the <code>-Djava.security.debug=jar</code> parameter for the code above and got this difference in the output (for jar files signed with and without timestamp, checked on Java 6 and Java 8):</p>

<p>Java 6, no timestamp (CERTIFICATE.RSA is under 4 KB here):</p>

<pre><code>jar: beginEntry META-INF/MANIFEST.MF

</code></pre>

<p>Note the ""warning"" about ""Unsupported signer attribute: 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.2.47""; but still, the certificate is parsed fine.</p>

<p>Now, the problem: Java 6, with timestamp (CERTIFICATE.RSA is over 7 KB here):</p>

<pre><code>jar: beginEntry META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
jar: beginEntry META-INF/CERTIFICATE.SF
jar: processEntry: processing block
jar: beginEntry META-INF/CERTIFICATE.RSA
jar: processEntry: processing block
jar: ignoring unsupported signer attribute: 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.2.47
jar: processEntry caught: sun.security.pkcs.ParsingException: Unable to parse the encoded bytes
jar: done with meta!
jar: nothing to verify!
...
</code></pre>

<p>So, Java can't parse some block, therefore it treats the whole jar as unsigned, therefore our check (above) fails: the JarEntry::getCertificates() returns null.
For the sake of completeness: running ""jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs SuperAwesome.jar"" prints everything fine for the jarsigner from JDK 8, and prints for each jar entry that it was simply ""mentioned"" (not signed) for JDK 6.</p>

<p>Debugging with some OpenJDK source code attached, I found that this is why Java 6 fails (<code>sun.security.pkcs.PKCS9Attribute#PKCS9Attribute(sun.security.util.DerValue)</code>):</p>

<pre><code>    ...
    // get the oid
    ObjectIdentifier oid = val[0].getOID();
    index = indexOf(oid, PKCS9_OIDS, 1);
    if (index == -1) {
        if (debug != null) {
            debug.println(""ignoring unsupported signer attribute: "" + oid);
        }
        throw new ParsingException(""Unsupported PKCS9 attribute: "" + oid);
    }
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>While Java 8 passes fine:</p>

<pre><code>    ...
    // get the oid
    oid = val[0].getOID();
    byte[] content = val[1].toByteArray();
    DerValue[] elems = new DerInputStream(content).getSet(1);

    index = indexOf(oid, PKCS9_OIDS, 1);
    if (index == -1) {
        if (debug != null) {
            debug.println(""Unsupported signer attribute: "" + oid);
        }
        value = content;
        return;
    }
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Also, all logic in <code>sun.security.pkcs.PKCS9Attribute</code> is ready for this.index == -1, unlike in the Java 6 version. I can even modify this class to be more like in JDK 8, and then the test passes; the problem however is that I don't have control over the user's JDK.</p>

<p>It looks like my problem could be solved if the certificate didn't have this ""1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.2.47"" oid present (the only info I could find on it is: <a href=""http://oid-info.com/get/1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.2.47"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">id-aa-signingCertificateV2</a>). I have to confess I know nothing about the whole process of signing (both in principle and how it's done by our Release Engineering -- it seems they obscure it on purpose), certificates etc.</p>

<p>Now, my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Am I right that the most straightforward way to fix this would be to get rid of this attribute ""1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.2.47""?</li>
<li>Is it possible to say having the information I provided what introduces it into the resulting certificate that ends up in the jar file? (That CERTIFICATE.RSA)</li>
<li>If not, could you hint me what my next steps could be in trying to track down or fix the problem? I am stuck.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am on Windows 7, using Oracle JDK 6 update 45 and Oracle JDK 8 update 20.
Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>It means that when calling the SEC_PKCS7Encode, it calls a method in PLDS4.DLL that make Firefox crash.</p>

<p>I tried to call SEC_PKCS7Encode using an empty SEC_PKCS7ContentInfo (with SEC_PKCS7CreateData()) and it didn't crash. It crashes only when the SEC_PKCS7ContentInfo is filled.</p>

<p>After some reaserchs , I find this issue : <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=702307"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=702307</a> 
I don't know if this issue is what makes my Firefox crash.</p>

<p>I tried to use different version of the NSS (3.12,  3.15, 3.16.2) the results are exactly the same.</p>

<p>Is there some way to avoid this problem ? is there a way to encode my SEC_PKCS7ContentInfo whithout using SEC_PKCS7Encode ?</p>

<p>thanks in advance.</p>

<p>EDIT 11/07/2014</p>

<p>As nmaier mentioned in is response, the probleme seems to be the utilisation of two different NSS (even if it is the same version of the nss because the one in mozilla has different dependencies for exemple).</p>

<p>The signature (and other processes) are done in a C++ project (the Dll used by my extension is generated from this project with visual studio 2013). But in order to compile and build the DLL, the project must have the NSS libs and includes (it is quite normal, I use NSS methods in my project).
The main question is how can I refer the MOZILLA FIREFOX NSS libs and include. I compiled a NSS of the same version of the Firefox's NSS, but the dependecies are different. 
I also tried to get the FireFox sources and compile it's NSS with mozilla build but I got errors. If I can get the Firefox's NSS libs, I could just load the Firefox's NSS dll in my extension.</p>

<p>How can I refers Mozilla firefox's NSS libs in my C++ project to build my custom DLL using the right libs ?</p>
","<p>I'd expect this to misbehave: Firefox already load nss and dependent libraries. Trying to load the ""same"" DLL again, but in a different version will cause the DLL loader to resolve dependent imports using the exports from the initially loaded DLL that comes with Firefox, not your copies of older versions of the same DLL. And this mix of new stuff and old stuff then breaks and crashes.</p>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not build and ship DLLs in the first place...</li>
<li>but use the DLLs that Firefox already comes with. (e.g. see <a href=""http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/e268bb51e084/services/crypto/modules/WeaveCrypto.js#l123"" rel=""nofollow""><code>WeaveCrypto.js</code></a>)</li>
<li>Update your <code>ctypes</code> calls if the nss API it uses changed in the meantime.</li>
<li>Make sure your <code>ctypes</code> declarations are correct and still up-to-date.</li>

<p>It means that when calling the SEC_PKCS7Encode, it calls a method in PLDS4.DLL that make Firefox crash.</p>

<p>I tried to call SEC_PKCS7Encode using an empty SEC_PKCS7ContentInfo (with SEC_PKCS7CreateData()) and it didn't crash. It crashes only when the SEC_PKCS7ContentInfo is filled.</p>

<p>After some reaserchs , I find this issue : <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=702307"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=702307</a> 
I don't know if this issue is what makes my Firefox crash.</p>

<p>I tried to use different version of the NSS (3.12,  3.15, 3.16.2) the results are exactly the same.</p>

<p>Is there some way to avoid this problem ? is there a way to encode my SEC_PKCS7ContentInfo whithout using SEC_PKCS7Encode ?</p>

<p>thanks in advance.</p>

<p>EDIT 11/07/2014</p>

<p>As nmaier mentioned in is response, the probleme seems to be the utilisation of two different NSS (even if it is the same version of the nss because the one in mozilla has different dependencies for exemple).</p>

<p>The signature (and other processes) are done in a C++ project (the Dll used by my extension is generated from this project with visual studio 2013). But in order to compile and build the DLL, the project must have the NSS libs and includes (it is quite normal, I use NSS methods in my project).
The main question is how can I refer the MOZILLA FIREFOX NSS libs and include. I compiled a NSS of the same version of the Firefox's NSS, but the dependecies are different. 
I also tried to get the FireFox sources and compile it's NSS with mozilla build but I got errors. If I can get the Firefox's NSS libs, I could just load the Firefox's NSS dll in my extension.</p>

<p>How can I refers Mozilla firefox's NSS libs in my C++ project to build my custom DLL using the right libs ?</p>
","<p>I did It.</p>

<p>In order to specify firefox's NSS in my project, I had to build an entire Firefox with the mozilla-build tool, and then recover the Libs and include for inside the OBJ directory.</p>

<p>this will generate my project as DLL that refers the good version of the DLL.</p>

<p>(this is not the greatest solution I think, as there is a NSS changement of the NSS between Firefox  21 and  22, so my solution will only work for firefox between 22 and the next version of Firefox that include NSS changes.)</p>

<p>(with a <code>byte[] hash</code>), at least this is what your example file suggests.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>adbe.pkcs7.detached</strong>: No data is encapsulated in the PKCS#7 signed-data field.</li>
  <li><strong>adbe.pkcs7.sha1</strong>: The SHA1 digest of the byte range is encapsulated in the PKCS#7 signed-data field with ContentInfo of type Data.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(section 8.7.2 ""Signature Interoperability"")</em></p>

<p>As you used the equivalent functionality for creating the CMS containers in both cases, you left the <em>PKCS#7 signed-data field</em> (by which the optional <code>eContent</code> octet string in the CMS <code>SignedData</code> field <code>EncapsulatedContentInfo</code> is meant) in your <strong>adbe.pkcs7.sha1</strong> container empty which is against the specification.</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong>: Ordinarily I would have referred to the ISO 32000 standards but unfortunately the corresponding sections in both part 1 and part 2 have been changed in a way that makes the content somewhere between even more unclear and outright wrong. Unfortunately that did not cross my mind when one could make inputs for ISO 32000-2.</p>

  <p>Is this a duplication of the same attribute? If not, what is the meaning of either?</p>

<p>In case of RPKI yes.</p>

<p>The reason is that this standard does not introduce a specialized new structure but merely a profile of an existing one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The RPKI signed object is a profile of the CMS [RFC5652] signed-data object</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>A CMS signed-data object in contrast to your RPKI one may contain multiple <strong>SignerInfo</strong> object in its <strong>signerInfos</strong> set, and each of them might make use of a different <strong>digestAlgorithm</strong>. Thus, in a CMS signed-data object the initial <strong>digestAlgorithms</strong> set may sensibly contain multiple entries.</p>

<p>Actually that field is even more liberally specified:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>digestAlgorithms is a collection of message digest algorithm
          identifiers.  There MAY be any number of elements in the
          collection, including zero.  Each element identifies the message
          digest algorithm, along with any associated parameters, used by
          one or more signer.  The collection is intended to list the
          message digest algorithms employed by all of the signers, in any

<p>I have the <a href=""https://pastebin.com/yk1Ujhjc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">raw receipt here</a>, encoded in Base64.</p>

<p>I've sent this payload, with my secret key, to Apple <a href=""https://pastebin.com/YjkrBAYX"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">and got this response</a>.  Based on WWDC videos, and documentation, I believe I should be able to read this receipt directly, and without sending it to apple. </p>

<p>I'm guessing that PEMReader in BC is the correct starting point parse it, however I'm not sure how to actually use it.  I've scanned the BC source code for the strings ""PKCS"", and looked at unit tests, however all I ever see are casts from PEMReader into another format.</p>

<pre><code> using (var stream1 = new MemoryStream(receipt.Data))
 using (var stream2 = new StreamReader(stream1))
 {
       var pp = new PemReader(stream2);
       pp.ReadObject();

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>How do I use Bouncy Castle to verify a raw receipt payload generated from Apple Store?</li>
</ul>

<p>Note to self: I intend to use this to inspect the actual binary to see if ApplicationUsername is included in the receipt, yet for some reason isn't returned in the JSON result when posting the server. (Bug on Apple's side?)</p>
","<p>I've made this using <strong>Java 7</strong> and <strong>BouncyCastle 1.56</strong>.</p>

<p>For the code below, consider that <code>pemString</code> is the PEM string you provided. But I had to make some modifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>format (break lines for every 64 characters) - I've made a small program to do that</li>
<li>include <strong>BEGIN</strong> and <strong>END</strong> headers</li>
</ul>

<p>So my PEM looks like:</p>

More specifically, I am trying to create a PKCS7 signature of an Apple Passbook pass manifest; the Passbook pass requires the PKCS7 signature file to be present in order to be a complete and valid pass.</p>

<p>I have spent almost a week researching and trying to no avail.  </p>

<p>I can successfully create the signature using openssl command line on my local PC with:</p>

<pre><code>openssl smime -binary -sign -certfile WWDR.pem -signer certificate.pem -inkey key.pem -in manifest.json -out signature -outform DER

<p>I can also successfully create the signature using M2Crypto library on my local PC with:</p>

<pre><code>from M2Crypto import BIO, SMIME, X509

s = SMIME.SMIME()
s.load_key('identity.pem')         # my certificate and private key

x509 = X509.load_cert('WWDR.pem')  # Apple's intermediate certificate
sk = X509.X509_Stack()

p7.write_der(pkcs7_buffer)

f = open('signature', 'w')
f.write(pkcs7_buffer.read())
f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>However, M2Crypto is a wrapper to OpenSSL which is not supported on GAE.</p>

<p>GAE supports the pycrypto library, but it doesn't seem this library has support for PKCS7 signing.</p>

<p>I've also looked at tlslite, which is a pure python implementation and therefore should be supported on GAE, but it also doesn't seem to have support for PKCS7 signing.</p>

<p>I'm looking for guidance from anyone that has been able to successfully create a PKCS7 signature on GAE.  If you could point me to a pure python library or any other solution, I'd really appreciate it.  </p>

<p>Otherwise, I feel like I've reached the boundary of what is possible with GAE and will be looking to move my app to another platform.  I'm a bit flabbergasted that it has been this difficult and that GAE doesn't support the openssl library given the importance of data security; it appears they aren't serious about providing a web app service that offers support for anything beyond the basics.  Unless (hopefully) I've missed the obvious.</p>

<p>thanks  </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>The question is why do I need the store in order to verify that the chain is properly signed ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You do not necessarily need a store parameter, you can set it to <code>NULL</code> as well and just verify the signature and not the entire chain of certificates. In that case, you should use the flag <code>PKCS7_NOVERIFY</code>, as explained in the <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/crypto/PKCS7_verify.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">manual for <code>PKCS7_verify()</code></a>. However, if you do want to verify the chain of certificates as well, you will somehow have to provide a mechanism to tell OpenSSL that you trust the root certificate and <code>X509_STORE</code> is a way to achieve that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, I don't have a trusted certficate store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From your question, it is not entirely clear what you situation is. But you do write that you have a separate function to ""validate the integrity of the root certificate"".</p>

<p>In that case, you can instantiate an <code>X509_STORE</code> object with <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/crypto/X509_STORE_new.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>X509_STORE_new()</code></a> and add your trusted certificate to it. There is an example in the OpenSSL source code tree of that in the <a href=""https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/OpenSSL_1_1_1/apps/apps.c#L1223"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">setup_verify()</a> function, which is for the case that the trusted certificate is available in a file. Or you could use <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man3/X509_STORE_add_cert.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">X509_STORE_add_cert()</a> if that fits your purpose better. After you have added that trusted certificate, you can use the store as a parameter to your <code>PKCS7_verify()</code> invocation.</p>

<p>You will want to decide between generating an attached or detached signature : with an attached signature, the ASN.1 structure contains the signed message, so you can read validate the signature and read the payload from the same data block (example : RSA certificates). With a detached signature, it'll be up to you to transmit the data and its signature separately (but the recipiend will need both in order to verify the signature - example : signed files available for download on a public FTP server). Usually the question is answered simply by asking yourself if the recipient may want to use the payload without verifying its signature first, or not.</p>

"56818371","What is the correct behavior of C_Decrypt in pkcs#11?","<p>I am using <code>C_Decrypt</code> with the <code>CKM_AES_CBC_PAD</code> mechanism. I know that my ciphertext which is 272 bytes long should actually decrypt to 256 bytes, which means a full block of padding was added.</p>

<p>I know that <a href=""http://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-base/v2.40/os/pkcs11-base-v2.40-os.html#_Toc416959738"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">according to the standard</a> when invoking <code>C_Decrypt</code> with a NULL output buffer the function may return an output length which is somewhat longer than the actual required length, in particular when padding is used this is understandable, as the function can't know how many padding bytes are in the final block without carrying out the actual decryption.</p>

<p>So the question is whether if I know that I should get exactly 256 bytes back, such as in the scenario I explained above, does it make sense that I am still getting a <code>CKR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL</code> error as a result, despite passing a 256 bytes buffer? (To make it clear: I am indicating that this is the length of the output buffer in the appropriate output buffer length parameter, see the parameters of <a href=""http://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-base/v2.40/os/pkcs11-base-v2.40-os.html#_Toc416959745"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C_Decrypt</a> to observe what  I mean)</p>

<p>I am encountering this behavior with a Safenet Luna device and am not sure what to make of it. Is it my code's fault for not querying for the length first by passing NULL in the output buffer, or is this a bug on the HSM/PKCS11 library side?</p>

<p>One more thing I should perhaps mention is that when I provide a 272 (256+16) bytes output buffer, the call succeeds and I am noticing that I am getting back my expected plaintext, <em>but also the padding block</em> which means 16 final bytes with the value 0x10. However, the output length is updated correctly to 256, <em>not</em> 272 - this also proves that I am not using CKM_AES_CBC instead of CKM_AES_CBC_PAD accidentally, which I suspected for a moment as well :)</p>
","<p>I have used <em>CKM.AES_CBC_PAD</em> padding mechanism with <em>C_Decrypt</em> in past. You have to make 2 calls to <em>C_Decrypt</em> <em>(1st ==> To get the size of the plain text, 2nd ==> Actual decryption)</em>. see the documentation <a href=""https://www.cryptsoft.com/pkcs11doc/v230/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> which talks about determining the length of the buffer needed to hold the plain-text. </p>

<p>Below is the step-by-step code to show the behavior of decryption:</p>

<pre><code>//Defining the decryption mechanism
CK_MECHANISM mechanism = new CK_MECHANISM(CKM.AES_CBC_PAD);

//Initialize to zero -&gt; variable to hold size of plain text
LongRef lRefDec = new LongRef();

// Get ready to decrypt 
CryptokiEx.C_DecryptInit(session_1, mechanism, key_handleId_in_hsm);

// Get the size of the plain text -&gt; 1st call to decrypt
CryptokiEx.C_Decrypt(session_1, your_cipher, your_cipher.length, null, lRefDec);

// Allocate space to the buffer to store plain text.  
byte[] clearText = new byte[(int)lRefDec.value];

// Actual decryption -&gt; 2nd call to decrypt
CryptokiEx.C_Decrypt(session_1, eFileCipher, eFileCipher.length, eFileInClear,lRefDec);
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes, decryption fails because your input encryption data was misleading (however, encryption is successful but corresponding decryption will fail) the decryption algorithm. So it is important not to send raw bytes directly to the encryption algorithm; rather encoding the input data with UTF-8/16 schema's preserves the data from getting misunderstood as network control bytes.  </p>

"53408547","Using openssl to check if root certificate in PKCS#7 is revoked","<p>Here's <code>pkcs7_verify</code> signature taken from C/C++ library: </p>

<pre><code>int PKCS7_verify(PKCS7 *p7, STACK_OF(X509) *certs, X509_STORE *store,
             BIO *indata, BIO *out, int flags);
</code></pre>

<p>It can be used with PKCS7 block (p7) and the section that it suppose to sign (in data). </p>

<p>I wonder how does this check detect if one of the certificate in the chain is revoked...</p>

<p>From what I know, revocation check can be made only if matching against another certificate outside the pkcs7 block, which is marked as revoked.</p>

<p>I checked the function arguments and found one that represent the list of store trusted certificates. </p>

<p>This arg should hold the certificate which is the issuer of the lower-most certificate in the pkcs7 chain. So my guess is that if this certificate is marked as revoked, we fail the check on <code>revocation</code> reason... </p>

<p>But what if another certificate higher in the chain is revoked ? how do I provide this piece of information to <code>pkcs7_verify</code> ?</p>

<p>Or perhaps there's another openssl method that decide if a certificate in the chain is revoked or not ?</p>

<p>UPDATE: </p>

<p>I've found an alternative way to check whether a certificate is revoked. In the example below we can see that <code>revoked_test.pem</code> is identified as revoked by matching against the list in <code>crl_chain.pem</code>. How can I do it programmatically ? </p>

<pre><code>openssl verify -crl_check -CAfile crl_chain.pem revoked-test.pem 
revoked-test.pem: OU = Domain Control Validated, OU = PositiveSSL, CN = xs4all.nl
error 23 at 0 depth lookup:certificate revoked
</code></pre>

<p>thanks </p>
","<p>Most of the rules of the certification path validation is set in the <code>X509_STORE</code> structure you are passing to the <code>PKCS7_verify</code> function.</p>

<p><s><a href=""http://itsjustsosimple.blogspot.com/2017/05/openssl-how-to-verifying-certificate.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This example</a> show how to build a complete X509_STORE and explain how to activate the CRL validation in the X509_STORE.</s> (the example is good for setting up the crl validation but not for the certificate chain handling)</p>

<p>The core functions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>X509_STORE_set_flags</code></li>
<li><code>X509_STORE_add_crl</code> </li>
<li><code>X509_STORE_add_lookup</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You use the <code>X509_STORE_set_flags</code> to tell the certificate store to perform CRL validation. The flags you need are: <code>X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK_ALL | X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK</code>. You can find all flags <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/crypto/X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_depth.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>You use the<code>X509_STORE_add_crl</code> to add CRLs for the validation. The CRL doesn't need to be from a root CA.</p>

<p>As an option to the<code>X509_STORE_add_crl</code>, you have the <code>X509_STORE_add_lookup</code>, to add a function to lookup for CRLs in any place (e.g.: file system, database, urls, etc.).</p>

<p>When performing the chain validation, OpenSSl will use the CRLs and lookup functions in the X509_STORE to validate all certificates in the chain. If any certificate in the chain is revoked, an error is returned.</p>

<p>It's important to add that <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the X.509 certification path validation</a> specification doesn't include the validation of trust anchors (usually root certificates). All certificates in the chain under the trust anchor have to be verified, but the trust anchor is trusted because the verifier set it as so (i.e.: the trust anchor validation is made out-of-bounds by the verifier).</p>

","<p>The <a href=""http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gcrypt/Cryptographic-Functions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">gcrypt manual</a> talks about ""type 1 padding"" (for signatures) and ""type 2 padding"" (for encryption). This means that it implements the ""old-style"" PKCS#1 signature and encryption methods, also called ""v1.5"" because they were the only ones specified in PKCS#1 v1.5. gcrypt does not appear (from what I see in the documentation) to implement the more recent OAEP (encryption) and PSS (signature) paddings.</p>

<p>Note, though, that the ""v1.5"" paddings are still specified in more recent versions of <a href=""http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2125"" rel=""nofollow"">PKCS#1</a>, so it can be said that gcrypt is also implemented against PKCS#1 v2.1 -- but it does not implement <em>all</em> of it.</p>

<p>It's not clear to me what output format you -- or the site you link -- want. 
Using binary/DER is fairly common, but can't be cut&amp;pasted and is harder to work with. Base64 of DER is rare but not unknown. If you or they want the standard PEM format, used by a lot of software, that is NOT merely base64 of DER; it is base64 of DER PLUS line breaks every 64 characters AND dash-BEGIN and dash-END lines added.</p>

<p>Also, SHA-1 has been broken for collision more than a year; see <a href=""https://shattered.io"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://shattered.io</a> and the numerous Qs on cryptography.SX and security.SX about this. Even before that it was prohibited for signatures by numerous authorities since 2014 or 2015, including NIST (for the US government) and CABforum (for public web certificates). I don't know anything about the data you are signing, but if it is in any way important or valuable, and you have the option to use a better hash in your signature(s), you should.</p>

<p>ADDED: also I asume you realize that <code>sun.*</code> classes are not documented, not guaranteed, and may stop working anytime Oracle feels like it.</p>

"35124071","PKCS7 Padding in JavaCard","<p>I am trying to implement my own PKCS7 padding scheme in JavaCard environment in case a smart card does not support PKCS5 or 7 padding schemes.</p>

<p>I want the block size of the PKCS padding scheme to be flexible in the event that different block size of symmetric ciphers are used. The <code>length</code> indicates the message input length and the <code>blocksize</code> indicates the size of a cipher's block.</p>

<p>My algorithm would check two scenarios in the PKCS7 padding namely if all bytes are the same bytes (e.g. <code>0A, 0A, 0A .. 0A, 0A, 0A</code>) which means there is no padding involved and would return a value <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>The second scenario is the checking if there is padding (e.g. <code>0A, 0B, 0C, 05, 05, 05, 05, 05</code>).</p>

<p>I am able to check all the scenarios successfully but when it comes to copying the data to output the result, it doesn't seem to copy correctly.</p>

<p>It seems like the <code>arrayFillGenericNonAtomic()</code> data that was filled before the <code>arrayCopyRepackNonAtomic()</code> is called is still stuck in the output byte array and doing the <code>arrayCopyRepackNonAtomic()</code> is not copying the data properly.</p>

<p>The output byte array format I am using is for the first element in the array to carry the indicator (in byte representation) of the amount of data that has been processed for output (e.g. <code>output[outputOffset] = (byte) 0x10</code> means 16 data element afterwards that has been processed). Subsequent data elements in the output byte array after the first element contains the processed data.</p>

<p>An example of the problem is I am trying to PKCS7 decode <code>A0, B0, C0, D0, E0, 04, 04, 04, 04</code> and the outcome should be <code>05, A0, B0, C0, D0, E0</code> (where the 05 represents following 5 bytes are processed) but I am getting <code>05, 04, 04, 04, 04 ..</code> instead.</p>

<p>How do I fix the problem of the <code>arrayCopyRepackNonAtomic()</code> not working as expected ?</p>

","<p>id-aa-timeStampToken is an unsigned attribute. If your implementation has no hooks to modify the message afterwards you can do it in two passes.

Paste the timestampToken in there and call final.</p>

<p>Be aware that using a timestamp usually requires a SIGNED attribute signing-time Pkcs9SigningTime (OID 1.2.840.113549.1.9.5) so save the time used on the first pass to get two identical CMS messages.</p>

","<p>Defined in <a href=""https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/OpenSSL_1_1_1/include/openssl/pkcs7.h#L61"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>pkcs7.h</code></a>, the <code>md_algs</code> attribute that you are inspecting is a stack of <code>X509_ALGOR</code> instances:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct pkcs7_signed_st {
    ASN1_INTEGER *version;      /* version 1 */
    STACK_OF(X509_ALGOR) *md_algs; /* md used */
    STACK_OF(X509) *cert;       /* [ 0 ] */
    STACK_OF(X509_CRL) *crl;    /* [ 1 ] */
    STACK_OF(PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO) *signer_info;
    struct pkcs7_st *contents;
} PKCS7_SIGNED;
</code></pre>

<p>It can be safely accessed via the <a href=""https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/STACK_API"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenSSL Stack API</a>, for example using the function <code>sk_X509_ALGOR_value()</code> to inspect its element(s).</p>

<p><code>X509_ALGOR</code> itself is defined in <a href=""https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/OpenSSL_1_1_1/include/openssl/x509.h#L59"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>x509.h</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>struct X509_algor_st {
    ASN1_OBJECT *algorithm;
    ASN1_TYPE *parameter;
} /* X509_ALGOR */ ;
</code></pre>

<p>The information you are looking for is stored in the property <code>algorithm</code>, which you can inspect using, for example, <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/crypto/OBJ_obj2txt.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>OBJ_obj2txt()</code></a>.</p>

<p>Tying it together, to get a textual representation of the first algorithm in the stack, you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>char tbuf[20];
X509_ALGOR *algor = sk_X509_ALGOR_value(Pkcs7-&gt;d.sign-&gt;md_algs, 0);
int res = OBJ_obj2txt(tbuf, sizeof tbuf, algor-&gt;algorithm, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>After that, <code>tbuf</code> should contain a value like <code>""sha1""</code> and <code>res</code> contains the length of that string. For programmatic purposes, a function like <code>OBJ_obj2nid()</code> is probably more useful.</p>

<hr>

<p>The debugger did not give you this information because the <code>data</code> field in the <code>stack</code> element is not strongly typed. You would have to cast it yourself to indicate that it is an array of pointers to <code>X509_ALGOR</code> structs. The OpenSSL Stack API provides you a set of macros that do the casting for you and access the array that way. And then, the <code>ASN1_OBJECT</code> that you end up with is hard to inspect or interpret in the debugger since it is just a bunch of bytes representing an object id in <code>ASN.1</code> format.</p>

<ul>
<li>PDF is prepared for signing and hash is calculated in the browser</li>
<li>hash is sent to the backend</li>
<li>detached CaDES signature is formed on the backend</li>
<li>detached CaDES is sent back to the browser where PaDES signature is assembled</li>

<p>We have a working example of PDF signature that works like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>PDF is prepared and hash is calculated in the browser</li>
<li>hash is sent to the backend</li>
<li>detached PKCS7 signature is made on the backend (by using BouncyCastle lib)</li>
<li>detached PKCS7 is sent back to the browsere where PDF signature is assembled</li>
</ul>

<p>This is working fine.</p>

<p>However, now instead of BouncyCastle we are using <a href=""https://github.com/esig/dss"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DSS</a> library on the backend because we are trying to create a PaDES signature. So, DSS lib is creating detached CaDES (which should be the same as detached PaDES) instead of PKCS7. However, when the signature is assembled in the browser the signature is invalid (even the certificate info isn't visible).</p>

<p>From my understanding CaDES is an extension to PKCS7 so this approach should work. </p>

<p>I'm first trying to understand if something's wrong with our approach and if not, I'll try to share the code we're using to make a detached CaDES signature to see if something's wrong there.</p>
","<p>I figured it out. It was that the size of detached CaDES signature is more than 2 times bigger then detached PKCS7 signature, so we weren't leaving enough space for the signature to fit in, so the signature was basically overwritting the PDF content. When I increased the space for the signature everything is working as it should</p>

<p>This code in .Net Framework 4.7 and in .Net Core 2.1 do different result...</p>

<p>My message length is 73 bytes</p>

<p>result in .Net Framework - 1520 bytes</p>

<p>result in .Net Core - 1523 bytes</p>

<p>Why?</p>
","<p>On .NET Framework, if your .exe is targeting 4.7 or older then <code>new CmsSigner(cert)</code> indicates that the signer should use SHA-1 as their digest, at 4.7.1 and higher the default algorithms changed to SHA-2-256.</p>

<p>On .NET Core 2.1 the default is already SHA-2-256.</p>

<p>You can change either of them to whatever digest algorithm you like by setting the <code>DigestAlgorithm</code> property of <code>CmsSigner</code>.  e.g. <code>cmsSigner.DigestAlgorithm = new Oid(""2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1"");</code> now makes both of them use SHA-2-256.</p>

<p>Additionally, .NET Framework is encoding the RSA signature algorithm identifier as <code>{ id-rsaEncryption, NULL }</code> and .NET Core is encoding it as <code>{ id-rsaEncryption }</code> (omitting the optional second value).  This part doesn't change the semantic interpretation of the content, but means that when using the same digest algorithm on both, they still won't come out to the same length.</p>

<hr>

<p>The DER encoding of the SHA-2-256 algorithm identifier is two bytes longer than the DER encoding of the SHA-1 identifier (assuming that the parameters value for SHA-2-256 is omitted, and for SHA-1 it is NULL).  This gets written down twice (+4 to core), then the difference in how the RSA signature algorithm identifier is represented makes the .NET Core version 2 bytes smaller (net: +2 to core)</p>

<p>The reason that you see a <em>three</em> byte difference, instead of two, is that some portion of your document structure ends up passing one of the thresholds where the length prefix (which is variable length) needs to gain an extra byte to hold the value.  Those points are the standard ""byte boundaries"" (255 -> 256, 65535 -> 65536, etc) in addition to 127 -> 128. Your SignerInfo block is likely 254 or 255 bytes on your .NET Framework document, and crosses over to 256 or 257 due to the longer identifier value for SHA-2-256.</p>

<p>In addition Acrobat of course validate the integrity of the document for this signature.</p>

<p>thanks in advance!</p>
","<p>Please be aware that in a <code>SignedData</code> object there are multiple hash values to consider which generally are not equal.</p>

<p>Have a look at the definition of the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) objects in <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3852"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 3852</a>.</p>

<p>(<a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3852"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 3852</a> is the RFC referenced from the current PDF specification ISO 32000-1; thus, even though it is <em>obsoleted by</em> <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 5652</a>, changes in the newer RFC might not apply in this context.)</p>

<pre><code>  SignedData ::= SEQUENCE {
    version CMSVersion,
    digestAlgorithms DigestAlgorithmIdentifiers,
    encapContentInfo EncapsulatedContentInfo,
    certificates [0] IMPLICIT CertificateSet OPTIONAL,
    crls [1] IMPLICIT RevocationInfoChoices OPTIONAL,
    signerInfos SignerInfos }

...

  SignerInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
    version CMSVersion,
    sid SignerIdentifier,
    digestAlgorithm DigestAlgorithmIdentifier,
    signedAttrs [0] IMPLICIT SignedAttributes OPTIONAL,
    signatureAlgorithm SignatureAlgorithmIdentifier,
    signature SignatureValue,
    unsignedAttrs [1] IMPLICIT UnsignedAttributes OPTIONAL }

...

  SignedAttributes ::= SET SIZE (1..MAX) OF Attribute

...

  signedAttrs is a collection of attributes that are signed.  The
  field is optional, but it MUST be present if the content type of
  the EncapsulatedContentInfo value being signed is not id-data.
  SignedAttributes MUST be DER encoded, even if the rest of the
  structure is BER encoded.  Useful attribute types, such as signing
  time, are defined in Section 11.  If the field is present, it MUST
  contain, at a minimum, the following two attributes:

     A content-type attribute having as its value the content type
     of the EncapsulatedContentInfo value being signed.  Section
     11.1 defines the content-type attribute.  However, the
     content-type attribute MUST NOT be used as part of a
     countersignature unsigned attribute as defined in section 11.4.

     A message-digest attribute, having as its value the message
     digest of the content.  Section 11.2 defines the message-digest
     attribute.

...

  The result of the message digest calculation process depends on
  whether the signedAttrs field is present.  When the field is absent,
  the result is just the message digest of the content as described
  above.  When the field is present, however, the result is the message
  digest of the complete DER encoding of the SignedAttrs value
  contained in the signedAttrs field.  Since the SignedAttrs value,
  when present, must contain the content-type and the message-digest
  attributes, those values are indirectly included in the result.
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, your observation</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>that the messageDigest field is equal to the calculated digest of the signedContent obtained using the ByteRange.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code> 5178:d=6  hl=2 l=  47 cons: SEQUENCE

</code></pre>

<p>indicates that the correct data is signed because the <em>message-digest attribute</em> shall have <em>as its value the message digest of the content</em>.</p>

<p>But as you can also read here, the data signed by the actual inner <em>signature</em> bytes (which you decrypted) is <em>not this message digest of the content</em> but instead the <em>collection of attributes signedAttrs</em>!</p>

<p><strong>Thus, you must not verify those <em>signature</em> bytes against the <em>content</em> hash but against the <em>signed attributes</em> hash as described in the RFC.</strong></p>

<p>PS: The OP meanwhile found <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/24581628/1729265"">this other answer</a> on the topic of CMS signed data verification which additionally illustrates how one can more graphically identify which attributes are signed and which are not.</p>

<p>PPS: The OP verifies by <em>decrypting</em> the signature bytes, extracting the contained hash, and comparing it with the actual one. This is ok for signatures based on RSA. Signatures based on DSA or ECDSA cannot be decrypted, though, so the hash value cannot be extracted. Special verification routines must be used for their verification.</p>

<p>PPPS: There are different styles of integrated PDF signatures. While the style (PKCS7/CAdES detached) used here is the most common and recommended one, in a generic solution one has to check beforehand and verify accordingly.</p>

<p>Both signs are valid if you insert them into online pkcs7 decoder (<a href=""https://redkestrel.co.uk/products/decoder/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://redkestrel.co.uk/products/decoder/</a> for example) but they have diferent message digest octet inside auth_attributes which is the part that government uses to check if the message is valid.</p>

<p>I know that they use/bend over <em>openssl smime</em> function which should be for email and for CMS they should use newer <em>openssl cms</em> function, but CMS should be compatible with smime which is older.</p>

<p>What I'm doing wrong in my function that the digest of the same string is different?</p>

<p>I'm using SHA256 algorithm (they too), no certs. inside PKCS#7 (they too), adding time to auth. attribute (they too).</p>

<p>Only two things are different.
1) They have generated some SMIME related information inside auth. attribute but it should be out of the game since we need the same message digest.</p>

<p>2) I'm getting certificate directly from cert. store inside windows for C# APP. OpenSSL is using .pem exported from the store. But they should be equal.</p>

<p>Is there any way how can I reproduce the same algorithm (get the same digest) used by OpenSSL smime function without linking of C++ libraries?</p>

<p>But this function is not matching the signature.
Please help me with this problem.</p>

<p>Thank you...</p>
","<p>I can't, personally, get the data to validate.  (I'm assuming that either there are trailing spaces that aren't copying correctly or that the payload has been altered (e.g. ""My address is private""))</p>

<p>The flow that I expect is happening:</p>

<ul>
<li>The pkcs7 content is a CMS SignedData with detached content.</li>
<li>The signed content was specified in the first stream</li>
</ul>

<p>So you need to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] dataBytes = ReadFirstSegment();
byte[] signatureBytes = ReadSecondSegment();

SignedCms cms = new SignedCms(new ContentInfo(dataBytes), detached: true);
cms.Decode(signatureBytes);
// This next line throws a CryptographicException if the signature can't be verified
cms.CheckSignature(true);

SignerInfoCollection signers = cms.SignerInfos;

if (signers.Count != 1)
{
    // probably fail
}

if (!IsExpectedCertificate(signers[0].Certificate))
{
    // fail
}

// success

"52376546","How to encrypt with Twofish using ECB cipher mode and PKCS7 block padding mode?","<p>I want to access an API with PHP. The specifications are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Twofish algorithm</li>
<li>ECB cipher mode</li>
<li>PKCS7 block padding mode</li>
</ul>

<p>I have tried a lot of different PHP functions and libraries, but none seems to work.</p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>function encrypt($data, $key)
{
  // Pad for PKCS7
  $blockSize = mcrypt_get_block_size(MCRYPT_TWOFISH, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB);
  $len = strlen($data);
  $pad = $blockSize - ($len % $blockSize);

  $encryptedData = mcrypt_encrypt( MCRYPT_TWOFISH, $key, $data, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB);

  return $encryptedData;

<p><strong>Do you see a problem with this code?</strong></p>
","<p><code>mcrypt_encrypt</code> does not support PKCS7 padding.  It has also been deprecated for a significant period of time.</p>

<p>If the API you want to talk to is using Twofish and ECB mode then you probably don't want to use that API at all - if they're happy to whack an incredibly insecure encryption scheme together for the front-facing API then the rest of their codebase is probably pretty shammy too.</p>

So far, the best data I've found so far pertaining to data structure is an Paypal example code which demonstrates how a encrypted button appears on your website (this can be found here:<a href=""https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/xcl/rec/ewp-techview-outside"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/xcl/rec/ewp-techview-outside</a>) </p>

<p>At first glance, my results seem to be exactly as demonstrated within the Paypal eaxmple link, except that when i proceed to click the button i get a Paypal error saying ""We were unable to decrypt the certificate id"". Therefore I think that the problem is either how the data is structured or the actual encryption itself (I've also done alot of debugging and have made sure that all certificates and keys are being successfully registered ). The code below demonstrates the button that my php code creates.</p>

","<ul>
<li><p>Two things must be taken into account:</p>

<p>1) For decryption, the IV used for encryption is required. </p>

<p>2) For security reasons, a new IV must be randomly generated for each encryption so that no IV is used more than once with the same key, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9049789/aes-encryption-key-versus-iv"">here</a>. </p>

<p>Therfore, the IV must be passed from the encryption-side to the decryption-side. This doesn't happen automatically, but has to be implemented.</p></li>
<li><p>One possibility is to concatenate the byte-arrays of IV and ciphertext. Usually the IV is placed before the ciphertext and the result is Base64-encoded (if required), e.g. in Java: </p>

<pre><code>// Concatenate IV and ciphertext
byte[] iv = ...
byte[] ciphertext = ...
byte[] ivAndCiphertext = new byte[iv.length + ciphertext.length];
System.arraycopy(iv, 0, ivAndCiphertext, 0, iv.length);
System.arraycopy(ciphertext, 0, ivAndCiphertext, iv.length, ciphertext.length);
// If required: Base64-encoding
</code></pre>

<p>This data is transmitted to the decryption-side, which separates both parts after Base64-decoding. In the case of AES-CBC, the IV is 16 bytes long, so the first 16 bytes represent the IV and the rest the ciphertext. The IV doesn't need to be encrypted because it isn't secret. </p>

<p>Specifically for your case this means that you have to concatenate IV and ciphertext on the Java-side and to Base64-encode the result. On the Dart-side you have to Base64-decode first and then both parts, IV and ciphertext, can be separated and used for the following decryption.</p></li>
<li><p>There are two ways to generate the IV before encryption: Implicit generation by the <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/javax/crypto/Cipher.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Cipher</code></a>-instance as in your example or explicit generation e.g. via <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/java/security/SecureRandom.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SecureRandom</a>. Both alternatives are discussed <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/29267873/9014097"">here</a>. If the IV is generated implicitly (via the <code>Cipher</code>-instance), then this IV must be determined via the <code>Cipher</code>-instance, since it is later required for decryption:</p>

<pre><code>// Determine IV from cipher for later decryption
byte[] iv = cipher.getParameters().getParameterSpec(IvParameterSpec.class).getIV();
</code></pre>

<p>If the IV is determined explicitly (e.g. using <code>SecureRandom</code>), it must be passed to the <code>Cipher</code>-instance so that it will be used in the running encryption. This is done using an <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/javax/crypto/spec/IvParameterSpec.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>IvParameterSpec</code></a>.</p>

<pre><code>// Assign IV to cipher so that it is used for current encryption
byte[] iv = ...
IvParameterSpec ivParameterSpec = new IvParameterSpec(iv);
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretkeySpec, ivParameterSpec);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>A hard-coded key is in general not good practice (except for testing purposes perhaps). However, the topic of key generation/management is outside the scope of this answer. There are already a lot of questions and answers on this subject. If your question is not covered by these answers, please post a new question. A hard-coded IV doesn't occur within the above architecture and should only be used for testing purposes.  </p></li>

"39651411","SMIME with BIO, char * and binary data","<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>

<p>1- I'd like to create a MIME message. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/mixed;
        boundary=""---12345""

This is a multipart message in MIME format.

---12345

This is the plain text

---12345
Content-Type: application/pdf

&gt;&gt; PDF binary code here &lt;&lt;

<p>2- Then i need to pass it to the OpenSSL functions in the form of <code>BIO * data</code>.</p>

<pre><code>PKCS7 *PKCS7_sign(..., ..., ..., BIO *data, ...);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The first approach</strong></p>

<p>Load the plain text and attachment data from the filesystem and assign it to <code>char * data</code>, manipulate the data to add the respective MIME headers, finally assign it to <code>BIO * memoryBIO</code> with <code>BIO_puts(memoryBIO, data);</code>.</p>

<p>But this approach doesnt work because the binary data contains ""\0""(NULL) which wont go well with <code>char</code> type.</p>

<p><strong>The second approach</strong></p>

<p>Assign plain text and attachment to a <code>BIO</code> <em>each</em> and then ""concatenate"" them. But couldn't find a way to do this.</p>

<p>I'd like to know if there is a way to accomplish such feat.
I'd also like to avoid using intermediary files and build everything in-memory.</p>

","<p>You are allocating a <code>PKCS7</code> object but it seems you are never calling <code>PKCS7_free</code>. For example, you would need to call it right before <code>throw ReceiptError.receiptNotSigned</code>.</p>

<p>Notice in the stack trace on the right there are stack frames missing. You can view them by clicking on the icon the looks like a square with a line above and below that. That way you know exactly which function call is responsible for the allocation (and thus likely what it is that leaked).</p>

","<p>PKCS#7 padding is deterministic. That means that unpadding should always be able to find out the padding length itself. So you first decrypt, then take the last byte (as number) and that is the padding length. <strong>For this to work, PKCS#7 padding is <em>always</em> applied. So the amount of padding, and thus the value of the bytes, is 1 to the blocksize, which is 16 bytes for AES.</strong> . If the plaintext is already dividable by 16, a full block of padding - with bytes valued 16 / 0x10 is applied. </p>

<p>In short, the calculation is:</p>

<pre><code>p = n - l % n
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>p</code> is the pad size &amp; value, <code>n</code> is the block size and <code>l</code> is the size of the plaintext.</p>

     '''
     RFC 2315: PKCS#7 page 21
     Some content-encryption algorithms assume the
     input length is a multiple of k octets, where k &gt; 1, and
     let the application define a method for handling inputs
     whose lengths are not a multiple of k octets. For such
     algorithms, the method shall be to pad the input at the
     trailing end with k - (l mod k) octets all having value k -
     (l mod k), where l is the length of the input. In other
     words, the input is padded at the trailing end with one of
     the following strings:

              01 -- if l mod k = k-1
             02 02 -- if l mod k = k-2
                         .

                         .
           k k ... k k -- if l mod k = 0

     The padding can be removed unambiguously since all input is
     padded and no padding string is a suffix of another. This
     padding method is well-defined if and only if k &lt; 256;
     methods for larger k are an open issue for further study.

"57707117","how to encrypt zip file with p7b certificate and sign it with p12","<p>I have a p7b file which includes the public key the goal is to encrypted a zip file with this public key and change the file to .zip.encrypted and then use a .p12 file to sign the content</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong> </p>

<p>Right now I'm trying to figure out how this works. Is this just pkcs#7 encryption or do I call it CMS Evelope? Since in the p7b file i only have a public rsa key how would I be able to encrypt a whole zip file with it? As far as I know you can only encrypt small bytes with RSA encryption. Is there somekind of bytestream that I can use to encrypt every single byte of a zip file by it self? Or do I generate somehow a AES key out of the public RSA key from the p7b file? Do I need to add the p7b certificate to my windows account to get access to the data inside? </p>

<p><strong>What I've tried</strong></p>

<p>I tried the .net recources and couldn't figure out how to get what I want, then I googled a lot found many examples how people encrypt a short string and tried to adapt but it was never working for me.</p>

<p>Now I'm using Bouncy Castle for c# and I think I was able to read the public key from my p7b file when I try to encrypt a normal short string, it seems to work. But when I use my zip file then I get an exception that my byte array is too big. The zip file I use for this test is only 3KB, the real files later will be up to ~200MB</p>

<p>So I guess the Way im using the p7b file aswell as bouncy castle for my problem is wrong.</p>

<p><strong>My Code</strong></p>

<pre><code> var p7bFilePath = @""key\Test.p7b"";
 var text = @""zipfile"";
 var bytesToEncrypt = File.ReadAllBytes(@""zip\test.zip"");
 var certi = ReadCertificate(p7bFilePath);
 var encodedPublicKey = certi.GetPublicKey();
 var encryptEngine = new Pkcs1Encoding(new RsaEngine());
 encryptEngine.Init(true, encodedPublicKey);
 var encrypted = Convert.ToBase64String(encryptEngine.ProcessBlock(bytesToEncrypt, 0, bytesToEncrypt.Length));

 Console.WriteLine(encrypted);

<p>I've been searching all over the net to find the correct command but couldnt find any.</p>

"34443523","PyCrypto AES decryption weirdness - python 2.7","<p>I'm encrypting files with AES using PyCrypto, but when I decrypt them they have garbage characters at the head of the file. Here's a stripped down example that encrypts a text file of Moby Dick and then attempts to decrypt it:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from os import urandom

key = urandom(32)
iv = urandom(16)
aes = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)

def encrypt_data(chunk):
    padding = AES.block_size
    if len(chunk):
        padding = AES.block_size - (len(chunk) % AES.block_size)
    return aes.encrypt(chunk + chr(padding)*padding)

with open('melville-moby-106.txt', 'r') as infile:
    with open('/tmp/test.tmp', 'w') as outfile:
        chunk = infile.read()
        while chunk:

        chunk = infile.read()
        while chunk:

            outfile.write(data)
            chunk = infile.read()
</code></pre>

<p>After I've run the script, I have these files:</p>

<pre><code>-rw-rw-r--  1 brian  brian  1223687 Dec 23 15:11 melville-moby-106.txt

-rw-rw-r--  1 brian  brian  1223696 Dec 23 15:40 test.tmp
</code></pre>

<p>The size looks right, but the checksums don't match:</p>

94b94e495d449dad919083029a66b675  melville-moby-106.txt.new
</code></pre>

<p>If I look at the files, here's what I see:</p>

<pre><code>$ head -n 1 melville-moby-106.txt

<p>The rest of the file's contents look OK.</p>

<p>Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong?</p>

<p>Here's the method for defining the algorithm inside the cert used for creating a signature:</p>

<pre><code>public static String getDigestMessageAndAlgorithmsForJcaContentSignerBuilder(X509Certificate cert)
    {
        switch (cert.getPublicKey().getAlgorithm()) 
        {
            case ""GOST3410_2012_256"": 
                return JCA_CONTENT_GOST_2012_256; //GOST3411-2012-256WITHECGOST3410-2012-256
            case ""GOST3410_2012_512"": 
                return JCA_CONTENT_GOST_2012_512; //GOST3411-2012-512WITHECGOST3410-2012-512
            case ""GOST3410EL"": 
                return JCA_CONTENT_GOST3410EL; //GOST3411withECGOST3410

            default: 
                throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Algorithm inside the certificate "" + cert.getPublicKey().getAlgorithm() + "" is not supported."");
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The code seems to halt at the following line:</p>

<pre><code>ContentSigner signer = new JcaContentSignerBuilder(AlgorithmUtils.getDigestMessageAndAlgorithmsForJcaContentSignerBuilder(signerCert)).setProvider(""BC"").build(key);
</code></pre>

<p>I figured it out because when I try to execute it I get the following output:</p>

<pre><code>preclosed ru.CryptoPro.JCP.Key.GostExchPrivateKey GOST3410DH_2012_256
1
2
3
4
5
6
</code></pre>

<p>Why is that? Is it related to using different crypto providers? I mean because <code>PrivateKey</code> is of type <code>ru.CryptoPro.JCP.Key.GostExchPrivateKey</code> whilst BC requires a different type?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

"58769162","Signed PDF verification in Origami with an Adobe PKCS#7 certificate","<p>I'm trying to verify the digital signature of a PDF. Here's what I've got:</p>

<p>A PDF that I've signed using Adobe Acrobat (tried both Pro 10 and Reader DC)</p>

<p>The key was generated in Acrobat Pro, I have access to the .p12, or exporting as FDF, PKCS#7 or just ""Certificate File"". Have also tried loading this ""Certificate File"" via Apple's ""Keychain Access"" and exporting that as a .pem from there, which had the same result (according to ruby's openssl - steps below) as me doing:</p>

<pre><code>openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -inform der -in pkcs7file.p7c -out certificate.cer
</code></pre>

<p>With the Origami gem, I've tried loading the certificate and attempting verification:</p>

<pre><code>cert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(File.read('/path/to/pem/or/cer.cer'))
Origami::PDF.read(File.open('/path/to/file.pdf', 'r')).verify(trusted_certs: [cert])
</code></pre>

<p>(just noticed that The .pem and .cer are identical, except that the .cer file includes ""subject="" and ""issue="" lines before the certificate)</p>

<p>Origami's output confirms the document has been signed, but the <code>verify(..)</code> method returns false.</p>

<p>Note that working through the code from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51984805/origami-openssl-error-while-validating-digital-signature-of-a-pdf-in-rails/54526938#54526938"">this excellent answer</a> works fine, but it only seems to work if you generate the X.509 keypair using openssl (e.g. the ruby-land bindings as per that code). Unfortunately I'm required to use the pre-existing Adobe-blessed signatures from the user's machines.</p>

<p>That said, aside from this I have very few restraints; I can ask the users to export their certificate in any other way that is useful to us (I can even run some simple code on their machines if necessary), though I mustn't transmit the private key in the procedure. I don't have to use Origami for the verification, but it does have to be a command accessible from ruby on an ubuntu server. The users are all running on Macs with reasonably up-to-date software.</p>
","<p>It's possible the ciphers are different. It could be that the Adobe cipher is not the same one that the openssl is using and would then fail the verification check. Take a look at this. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7402230/what-is-default-cipher-for-pem-format-in-openssl"">Details on ciphers</a> </p>

I was able to successfully obtain the answer I was expecting from one service.
But I have doubts about how I am treating the answer.
First of all clarify that I am a bit newbie in terms of encryption and soap web services.</p>

<p>This is the code in .NET that i want to migrate:</p>

<pre><code>using System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs;

        public string DecodeMessage(string message)
        {
            message = message.Split('-')[10].Substring(1, message.Split('-')[10].Length - 2);
            SignedCms = new SignedCms();
            SignedCms.Decode(Convert.FromBase64String(message));
            return Encoding.ASCII.GetString(SignedCms.ContentInfo.Content);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>And this is what i'm actually doing in Node:</p>

<pre><code>import * as forge from 'node-forge';

 public decodeMessage(message: string) {
        let p7 = forge.pkcs7.messageFromPem(message);
        return p7.rawCapture.content.value[0].value;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This code actually works, I'm able to recover the data from the response.
But is it correctly migrated?
Am I missing something? Like verify the signing?</p>
