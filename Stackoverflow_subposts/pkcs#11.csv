"6157550","What is the difference between a PKCS12 keystore and a PKCS11 keystore?","<p>I'm interested in Java-NSS libraries, and I'm reading the <a href=""http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Sun's P11 Guide</a>. I am confused on the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the difference between using a PKCS12 keystore and a PKCS11 keystore?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A keystore is just a keystore, right? Are there some differences? Can they be used interchangeably in any aspect?</p>
","<p>PKCS#12 is a file format (often called .p12 or .pfx) where you can store a private key and certificates. It's used for converting/transporting keys and certificates, mainly. If you export a private key + certificate from your browser, it's likely going to be in that format.</p>

<p>PKCS#11 is an interface, usually used to talk to hardware cryptographic tokens (often smart-cards or USB-tokens, which effectively are smart-cards embedded in a reader). This interface has a number of operations to make use of the keys and certificates. Some tokens are able to sign using the private key they contain, without the key being able to leave the device.
The point of this interface is to treat what handles the keys and certificates as a separate entity, without having to do the cryptographic operations that PKCS#11 offer (more specifically, the ones related to the private key).</p>

<p>When you use PKCS#11 with NSS, you're effectively using NSS as a black-box wrapped behind the PKCS#11 layer (it's effectively a software provider for what a PKCS#11 hardware token would be). There is a slight difference in the way Java uses NSS via PKCS#11 in that it doesn't require a PKCS#11 shared library (compared to other PKCS#11 libraries), so as such, it's not PKCS#11 strictly speaking, although it's very similar.</p>

<p>In Java, you may be able to get an <code>RSAPrivateKey</code> instance from a PKCS#11 store, use it to sign and decipher, without ever being able to get anything from its modulus. The security provider handling it will do the signing/deciphering via the library (and thus via the token, if that library is supported by a hardware token).</p>

<p>Coming back to the <code>KeyStore</code> in Java, it's an API that can allow you to load and use keys and certificates from files (you get various files formats such as JKS, PKCS#12, PEM, depending on your security provider) or from other underlying APIs (such as PKCS#11, more or less merged with NSS in the Sun provider, or the KeychainStore if you're on OSX and want to use the KeyChain as a KeyStore).</p>

","<p>From <a href=""http://www.pixelstech.net/article/1408345768--Different-types-of-keystore-in-Java----Overview"" rel=""nofollow"">Different types of keystore in Java -- Overview</a>, the differences between PKCS12 and PKCS11 can be described as following</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>PKCS12</strong>, this is a standard keystore type which can be used in Java and
  other languages. You can find this keystore implementation at
  sun.security.pkcs12.PKCS12KeyStore. It usually has an extension of p12
  or pfx. You can store private keys, secret keys and certificates on
  this type. Unlike JKS, the private keys on PKCS12 keystore can be
  extracted in Java. This type is portable and can be operated with
  other libraries written in other languages such as C, C++ or C#.</p>
  
  <p>Currently the default keystore type in Java is JKS, i.e the keystore
  format will be JKS if you don't specify the -storetype while creating
  keystore with keytool. However, the default keystore type will be
  changed to PKCS12 in Java 9 because its enhanced compatibility
  compared to JKS. You can check the default keystore type at
  $JRE/lib/security/java.security file:</p>
  
  <p><strong>PKCS11</strong>, this is a hardware keystore type. It provides an interface for
  the Java library to connect with hardware keystore devices such as
  SafeNet's Luna, nCipher or Smart cards. You can find this
  implementation at sun.security.pkcs11.P11KeyStore. When you load the
  keystore, you no need to create a specific provider with specific
  configuration. This keystore can store private keys, secret keys and
  certificates. When loading the keystore, the entries will be retrieved
  from the keystore and then converted into software entries.</p>

","<p>As far as I have come to understand, there are two ways of using PKCS#11 tokens in Java: using the Sun APIs, and using some proprietary implementation. Each has its advantages and disadvantages.
Sun'API main advantage is that it maps PKCS#11 tokens onto regular KeyStores. BouncyCastle can thus access the private keys in the token without actually figuring out that it is interacting with an hardware device. Moreover any native dependency is already bundled with Sun's JVM, and you don't have to worry about porting or supporting native code on different platforms. The main disadvantage is that it is non standard, so you are not guaranteed to find it on any JVM.
The commercial APIs (see IAIK's PKCS11 wrapper) are good, and even open sourced, but they have two disadvantages: they are made to work with another API (which you have to pay for...), so they do not expose the token as a KeyStore and you cannot use BouncyCastle transparently, and they have a native component which you have to maintain and distribute. If you have to work with PKCS#11 in a browser, you know what a pain that is...</p>

","<p>Currently (may 2016) it is not possible. </p>

<p>Chrome has dropped Java support. 'Windows edge' will not have. IE11 support is bad, and Oracle has decided to discontinue the java plugin. It would only be possible with Firefox, older versions of IE and the Java plugin.</p>

<p>The new WebCryptographyApi standard provides digital signature support for browsers, but it does not have pcks#11 support</p>

<p>Real e-goverment solution to solve this:
1) Install a local Java application on the user's PC. The application listens on a port as, for example 5678
2) In your page, javascript detects whether there is support for applets
3) If there is no support, connects to the application in the form <a href=""http://127.0.01:5678/sign"" rel=""nofollow"">http://127.0.01:5678/sign</a> and sends the data to sign.
4) The application is local and has no trouble using the operating system keystore, which includes drivers PKCS # 11. Make digital signature and prepares the result
5) page javascript periodically query the result and retrieves it when ready</p>

","<p>Don't do it with JavaScript. <a href=""http://www.matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/"">JavaScript cryptography has a number of problems</a>, and I don't think many browsers will let you access the PKCS#11 directly from JavaScript (running from within the page) easily.</p>

<p>A number of browsers support PKCS#11 for HTTPS authentication, that is, using PKCS#11 for client-certificate authentication as part of the SSL/TLS connection (as part of HTTPS).</p>

<p>Assuming you already have a PKCS#11 library available (let's say OpenSC in <code>/usr/lib/opensc.so</code>), you can configure Firefox to use it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Preferences -> Advanced -> Encryption, go in ""Security Devices""</li>
<li>Click on 'Load'</li>
<li>Choose a module name (for your own reference in the list) and point to the <code>/usr/lib/opensc.so</code> file (or whatever the appropriate PKCS#11 module is in your case).</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, when you connect to a website that requests a client certificate, the browser should offer you to choose a certificate from the PKCS#11-enabled device.</p>

<p>The PKCS#11 configuration mechanism will vary from one browser to another, but it's usually a matter of setting the path of the PKCS#11 module.</p>

<p>As far as I know, Internet Explorer doesn't use PKCS#11 (at least not without extra support), but should rely on MS CryptoAPI and InfoCards instead.</p>

<p>On the server side, you will need to configure the requirement for client-certificate authentication. Nothing specific to PKCS#11 there.</p>

<hr>

<p>Following your edit, you should read about Certification Authorities (CAs) and Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs). You could deploy your own internal PKI, but it sounds like your requirements are to integrate with an existing PKI. This is an administrative problem mainly, so check with those making this requirement to see on which CA they want to rely (probably theirs).</p>

<p>When using client-certificate authentication, the client will present its certificate (which contains the user's public key and other attributes, including an identifier: the Subject Distinguished Name) and the SSL/TLS handshake will ensure that the client has the private key for this public key certificate. Then, the server verifies this certificate against CAs it trusts (that's also an SSL setting on the server side).</p>

<p>Once you've configured which CAs you want to trust, the mapping is usually done using the certificate's Subject DN to an internal user name if needed. There is no hard rule for this, since it depends on your internal user naming scheme. This being said, it's often sensible to use the full Subject DN as the user name.</p>

<p>My guess it, it has something to do with openjdk or internal package <code>sun.security</code> which might usually not be used because it is an internal package. Activating Debug options might activate this internal package?</p>
","<p>I got the same problem today and I digged onto the java sources until I found the source of the problem. I know this question is quite old and already have an accepted answer, but that one is not a real answer.</p>

<p>Basically, the SunPKCS11 provider does list all available slots, then, get the slot you specified in your config, and give the error (since you do not specified any slot and fot its default value).</p>

<p>When in debug, after listing all available slots, it does list all slots with a smartcard inserted. After having print all these information about the slot list, <em>it does initialise</em> its slotid variable overwriting what you wrote (or forget to write) in your config. The new value is a correct one since it is read from the opensc defaults.</p>

<p>This is the relevant code from SunPKCS11.java from openjdk project:</p>

<pre><code>    long slotID = config.getSlotID();
    // ....
        if ((slotID &lt; 0) || showInfo) {
            long[] slots = p11.C_GetSlotList(false);
            if (showInfo) {
                System.out.println(""All slots: "" + toString(slots));
                slots = p11.C_GetSlotList(true);
                System.out.println(""Slots with tokens: "" + toString(slots));
            }
            if (slotID &lt; 0) {
                if ((slotListIndex &lt; 0) || (slotListIndex &gt;= slots.length)) {
                    throw new ProviderException(""slotListIndex is "" + slotListIndex
                        + "" but token only has "" + slots.length + "" slots"");
                }
                slotID = slots[slotListIndex];
            }
        }
        this.slotID = slotID;
</code></pre>

<p>So, a workaround is to always include in your config a negative value like <code>slot = -1</code>, so that the provider will always look for the right one.</p>

This allows me to read the public certificate and extract the data from it.</p>

"21167927","Getting certificates from PKCS11 Smartcard without PIN/password","<p>Abstract: when using JCA over PKCS11 over OpenSC, the PIN is requested when extracting certificates.</p>

<p>I have got an application that needs to sign using a smartcard. The smartcard is supported by OpenSC, so I am using the Java-built-in pkcs11 wrapper provider to use it. For functional reasons, I need to obtain the certificates in the card without a PIN requested. If the user finally signs, then, of course, the PIN is needed.</p>

<p>I see I can do it from command line without providing a PIN:</p>

<pre><code>pkcs11-tool --module C:\WINDOWS\system32\opensc-pkcs11.dll -r -a 50-MDS_Signature -y cert -o p.cer
Using slot 1 with a present token (0x1)
</code></pre>

<p>So far, so good.</p>

<p>The documentation from Oracle clearly says ""The builder will prompt for a password as needed using the previously configured callback handler"" (<a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html#Login"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html#Login</a>). However, my code does always request the pin as son as I call <code>KeyStore ks0 = ksbuilder0.getKeyStore();</code> even while only extracting public info (such as certificates).</p>

<p>Follows an extract of the code:</p>

<pre><code>private static final String PKCS11_LIB = ""C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\opensc-pkcs11.dll"";
private static final String NAME = ""OpenSCpkcs11"";
private static final String SLOT = ""1"";
private static final String PIN = ""11111111"";
private static final String ALIAS = ""myCert"";

[...]

private static CallbackHandler myCallbackHandler = new CallbackHandler() {
    @Override
    public void handle(Callback[] callbacks) throws IOException,
            UnsupportedCallbackException {
        for (Callback callback : callbacks) {
            if (callback instanceof PasswordCallback) {
                PasswordCallback passwordCallback = (PasswordCallback) callback;
                System.out.println(passwordCallback.getPrompt() + PIN);
                passwordCallback.setPassword(PIN.toCharArray());
            }
        }
    }
};

[...]

String configString = ""name = ""
  + NAME.replace(' ', '_')
  + ""\n""
  + ""library = ""
  + PKCS11_LIB
  + ""\n slot = ""
  + SLOT
  + "" ""
  + ""\n attributes = compatibility \n""
  + ""attributes(*,*,*)=\n{\nCKA_TOKEN=true\nCKA_LOCAL=true\n}"";
ByteArrayInputStream configStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(
    configString.getBytes());
SunPKCS11 pkcs11Provider0 = new SunPKCS11(configStream);
pkcs11Provider0.login(null, myCallbackHandler);
Security.addProvider(pkcs11Provider0);
KeyStore.CallbackHandlerProtection chp = new KeyStore.CallbackHandlerProtection(
    myCallbackHandler);
KeyStore.Builder ksbuilder0 = KeyStore.Builder.newInstance(
    ""PKCS11"", pkcs11Provider0, chp);
KeyStore ks0 = ksbuilder0.getKeyStore();
X509Certificate cert0 = (X509Certificate) ks0.getCertificate(ALIAS);
// System.out.println(""Cert "" + cert0.toString());
Principal p = cert0.getSubjectDN();
System.out.println(""I am: "" + cert0.getSubjectDN().getName());
</code></pre>

<p>It results on:</p>

<pre><code>Contraseña de la tarjeta de claves PKCS11 [SunPKCS11-OpenSCpkcs11]: 11111111

I am: CN=pepe perez, SURNAME=pepe, L=qwerty
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the password is requested before the certificate is got. By means of debugging I can see that the password is requested in the line <code>KeyStore ks0 = ksbuilder0.getKeyStore();</code></p>

<p>Any idea? Is there no way to configure it as I want? Any further idea or test?</p>

<p>Furthermore: do you know of any other way to access smartcards, for example directly through a JAVA2OpenSC wrapper or the like?</p>

<p>How to do it for El Capitan?
Or is there any version that is already built and can be used?</p>
","<p>El Capitan is tricky because Apple has implemented SIP (System Integrity Protection) which prevents write access to various system folders... (\system\library\security\ , \library\security, etc)</p>

<p>If you want to move forward with installing SCS or if you want to try manually adding/removing tokend files... you'll have to disable SIP first.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reboot into Recovery Mode (hold down Command+R)</li>
<li>Open Utilites > Terminal</li>
<li>Type 'csrutil disable' and hit enter</li>
<li>Reboot, and you'll be able to edit system files and/or install SCS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some extra advice regarding PKCS...
If you know what type of card you have, contact the manufacturer to get the appropriate PKCS tokend file. One size does not fit all unfortunately.</p>

<p>If you want to determine what type of card you have, plug in your reader, plug in the card, open Terminal and type pcsctest. When it asks for reader number type 01 and hit enter.</p>

<p>On that page, you'll find an ATR code. Grab that code and paste it <a href=""https://smartcard-atr.appspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>:</p>

<p>You should then have a manufacturer result. Search specifically for that smartcard manufacturer's PKCS libraries online (typically a .tokend file) </p>

<p>Good luck!!</p>

<p>My second question is regarding the dll to use for pkcs11. Currently i'm using on that is included in IBM's Rational's installation (jpkcs11.dll) but i'm really not sure that it's the good one. I do read about OpenSC but can't find the OpenSC-pkcs11.dll file. I only get to see opensc.dll.</p>

<p>I'm running on Windows7 with Java 1.6 27</p>

<p>Thank you</p>
","<p>OpenSC PKCS#11 is named ""opensc-pkcs11.dll"" and it is put to system32. But you need to make sure that your smart card is supported by OpenSC. As a general rule: you need to use the PKCS#11 provider that comes with your card (usually closed source) or supports your card (like OpenSC)</p>

<p>The easiest way will be to p-invoke into the pkcs11 library from c#, Call C_GetFunctionList to get pointers to the other functions the library exposes. then call C_Initialize, you can use this with the other new PKCS#11 stuff from thales-ncipher too,</p>

","<p>It is important to understand that <strong>PKCS#11 standard just defines the C language API</strong> to access smartcards and other types of cryptographic hardware (or even software). It is usually hardware vendor who provides software library (.dll for windows, .so for unix etc.) that implements PKCS#11 API and is able to access the hardware (smartcard in your case). Your application usually loads PKCS#11 library and uses PKCS#11 API functions it provides.</p>

<p>In most cases it is the best to use PKCS#11 library provided by your smartcard vendor but there are also many independent software vendors such as <a href=""http://www.aeteurope.nl/"" rel=""noreferrer"">A.E.T.</a> or <a href=""http://www.aloaha.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Aloaha</a> who provide smartcard middleware (software package that usually contains PKCS#11 library) that can access a bunch of widely used smartcards. You can also take a look at <a href=""https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki"" rel=""noreferrer"">OpenSC</a> project which provides an open source PKCS#11 library that supports <a href=""https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/Supported-hardware-%28smart-cards-and-USB-tokens%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">many popular smartcards and USB tokens</a>.</p>

<p>Now let's get back to your questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do I have a PKCS-11 supported smartcard?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have to check whether there exists a library (open source or commercial) that implements PKCS#11 API and supports your smartcard. If you can find such a library then the answer is yes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can I check it on Ubuntu?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you already have PKCS#11 library then you can install ""opensc"" package which provides command line application called ""pkcs11-tool"". You can use following command to list readers and cards accessible via your PKCS#11 library:</p>

<pre><code>pkcs11-tool --module your_pkcs11_library.so --list-slots
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to use PKCS#11 library provided by OpenSC project then just replace ""your_pkcs11_library.so"" with ""opensc-pkcs11.so"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What software I can use?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>PKCS#11 is widely supported standard so this question is hard to answer. I guess you would like to use open source applications with your smartcard because you have mentioned Ubuntu so here is the short list of well known applications that support PKCS#11:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mozilla Firefox - supports digital signature and client authentication</li>
<li>Mozilla Thunderbird - supports digital signing of e-mails</li>
<li>LibreOffice - supports digital signing of documents</li>
<li>TrueCrypt - supports disk encryption</li>
<li>OpenVPN - supports client authentication</li>
<li>OpenSSH - supports client authentication</li>

","<p>To verify Ubuntu sees your smartcard reader and identity card:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install libusb-1.0-0-dev pcsc-lite pcscd pcsc-tools</li>
</ol>

<p>The following tools will be installed:</p>

<ul>
<li>pcscd - systemctl status pcscd  -  sometimes the card reader crashes this daemon, so you may need to restart it.</li>
<li>opensc-explorer - it searches and displays smartcard readers attached</li>
<li>opensc-tool - Options will provide detailed information about your smartcard reader.</li>
<li>pcsc_scan - will show you smartcard reader and its status.  It should show your identity card inserted, as well as when you take it out.  If it displays waiting on reader - restart the pcscd service and try again.</li>

My question to you is, what do I do now? How can I access the certs on a token using 64 bit java libraries? Has someone written a 64 bit wrapper for such a task?</p>
","<p>PKCS11 Support was not implemented because there was no way to test that library (somehow, whatever).</p>

<p>This has changed in Java 8, though. Since J8b49 a 64 bit Version is included.

"12937138","How does JCA/JCE and PKCS#11 work (together)?","<p>I want to use a HSM (hardware security module) to create a signature of a XML file. I did a bit of research and am now a bit confused, though.</p>

<p>Can you please clarify those questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is meant with a <em>key handle</em> in JCE? I have read about it, that it is just a handle and the key is stored somewhere else. How can that be? From my understanding I either load the key into memory and use it, or the signing is done completely by a HSM and I only get the result, right?</li>
<li>Does the PKCS#11 standard define a way so that the signature is generated in the HSM? I've read about <em>tokens</em>, but I am not sure about signing.</li>
<li>The featurelist of my HSM states JCE and PKCS#11 separately. What does that mean? </li>
<li>I thought PKCS#11 is  a standard, and JCE defines classes to use that standard. Does JCE specify its own protocols?</li>
</ol>
","<ol>
<li><p><strong>What is meant with a key handle in JCE?</strong><br>
A key handle (in JCE, PKCS#11, or most other cryptographic APIs) is simply a reference that enables you to use a key without seeing its actual value. That is good: you can have the key permanently stored in a secure place (e.g. an HSM) with the assurance that nobody will be able to copy it and run away with it - as it may happen if the key is the application space. Unlike a physical safe though, you can still perform cryptographic operation without running any security risk of key leakage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Does the PKCS#11 standard define a way so that the signature is generated in the HSM?</strong><br>
PKCS#11 is a C API for cryptographic tokens. A <em>token</em> is a PKCS#11 abstraction for any device or program that offers services described by such API. The API defines which operations you can perform using the objects inside the PKCS#11 token: some objects are non sensitive, and can be extracted (e.g. public keys); some others are sensitive and can only be used, via handles.<br>
If you have a handle to an object that supports signing, you can use the C function <a href=""http://www.cryptsoft.com/pkcs11doc/v220/pkcs11__all_8h.html#aC_Sign"">C_Sign</a> to ask the token to authenticate some data provided by your application. The key does not leave the HSM.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The featurelist of my HSM states JCE and PKCS#11 separately. What does that mean?</strong><br>
Your HSM supports JCE in the sense that it comes with a native library that qualifies as a   <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html#ProviderArch"">Cryptographic Service Provider</a>.<br>
It supports PKCS#11 in the sense that it comes with a native library that offers a C PKCS#11 API.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I thought PKCS#11 is a standard, and JCE defines classes to use that standard. Does JCE specify its own protocols?</strong><br>
Indeed PKCS#11 is a standard; but it is not directly usable by languages other than C. You need a mapping layer that translates it into something compatible to your language. A PKCS#11 library (and the physical tokens that it abstracts) can be mapped to <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/security/p11guide.html"">a JCE provider</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>However, a JCE provider may have nothing to do with PKCS#11.</p>

<li>JDK 7 64bit</li>
<li>JRE 7 64bit</li>
</ul>

<p>The new funny JRE 7 64bit doesn't support Sun PKCS11 anymore (which is inside package 'sun.security.pkcs11'). And the big problem is that the end-users of the product by our company may have installed whatever version of JRE.</p>

<pre><code>(iaik-wrapper.jar)-&gt;(iaik-pkcs11-jni.dll)-&gt;(pki-token-driver.dll)
</code></pre>

<p>The PKI token driver dynamic link library is provided by the manufacturer of PKI USB token, it has the actual name of 'ca2-v34.dll'. The method to load this native driver is described in programmer's manual as below:</p>

<pre><code>import iaik.pkcs.pkcs11.*;

<p>The exception is raised at the line marked in the code above, with this detail: <strong>java.io.IOException: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.
ca2-v34.dll</strong></p>

<p>This exception surely means the IAIK library has found the .dll file, but it is not compatible somehow. I'm being stuck at this bottleneck.</p>
","<p>As noted by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/207421/ejp"">EJP</a> in the comments right below the question, <strong>ca2-v34.dll is a 32bit dll</strong>.

<p>The scenario of JRE is different:</p>

<ul>
<li>In case the client computer has JRE 32bit installed, the Java application (.jar file) can run well because the process of <strong>JVM is a 32bit process</strong>.</li>
<li>The other case is that the client computer has JRE 64bit installed, the Java application <strong>can not</strong> run normally because <strong>JVM in this case is a 64bit process</strong>, it can load the Java application (.jar file) but fails to load the file 'ca2-v34.dll' due to a reason that this dll file is 32bit dll.</li>

<p>I think your best bet would be to write a C program that calls PKCS#11 and accesses the HSM, and call that from your PHP app as an external binary.  Even if a PKCS#11 wrapper emerges for PHP, this approach will give you the full API available to the C code rather than having to make do with whatever the author of the wrapper needed to satisfy their own requirements.  PKCS#11 is a large API, and wrapper implementations are often less than complete.</p>

","<p>The openssl engine for pkcs#11 by OpenSC is needed to make interaction between openssl and smartcard by pkcs#11 possible.</p>

<p>The engine is built on top of libp11 by OpenSC, an abstraction/wrapper layer/interface, built on pkcs#11 standard API for utility purpose.</p>

<p>From top to bottom we have:</p>

<ul>
<li>openssl (by Openssl)</li>
<li>openssl pkcs#11 engine (by OpenSC)</li>
<li>libp11 (by OpenSC)</li>
<li>pkcs#11 standard api (by RSA Laboratories)</li>
<li>pkcs#11 module (by Smartcard vendor)</li>
</ul>

<p>So in an optimum case you have only to write the pkcs#11 module for you specific smartcard hardware and then load it using pkcs#11 engine.</p>

<p>The problem here is that pkcs#11 engine, at the moment, support only CKM_RSA_PKCS, so, probably, you have also to extend the current pkcs#11 openssl engine.</p>

<p>I tried to sign a PDF document with a digital certificate from PKCS # 11 type in C #. NET 4.0. As you know such a certificate requires a private key, in my case is stored on an Aladdin eToken, and then make a signature using itextsharp.</p>

<p>I tried with CAPICOM, System.Security.Cryptography, BouncyCastle, Chilkat, Net.Pkcs11, etc. But no works.</p>

<p>PdfSignatureAppearance has the method SetCrypto(key, cert, ..., ...) , where the first parameter is the key of the certificate and the second parameter is the same certificate, but I can't get the private key of the eToken. Hey read and think this is impossible.</p>

<p>I'm using C # native, using cryptography. NET in a few lines of code:</p>

<pre><code>X509Certificate2 x509 = (Certificate from X509Certificate2Collection);
CspParameters cspParams = new CspParameters(1"",eToken Base Cryptographic Provider"", ""Default"")
cspParams.Flags = CspProviderFlags.UseMachineKeyStore;
using (RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(cspParams))
{
byte[] signature = rsa.SignData(x509.RawData, ""SHA1"");
//I don't know how join it with itextsharp
rsa.PersistKeyInCsp = false;
rsa.Clear();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think I can use the method SignData(), but I'm a little confused. How I can relate itextsharp.</p>

<p>I found much documentation but nothing specific, such as java applets do not work because I have Windows 7 64 bits, and codes. NET does not work. I would, if possible, use the same core. NET or free libraries with support for Windows 7 64 bits. Someone did a real solution?</p>

<p>Also I would like to know how to delete the eToken PIN cache since it only asks me for the password once and then stays in memory.</p>

<p>Please I need your help.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>I've found this great framework to work with tokens: pkcs11.net<br>
found in here: <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/pkcs11net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pkcs11net/</a></p>

<p>The thing is:
with the rsa private key and certificate you got from the token, you it with use IText to sign. With the key, is the plain signing you are shown in IText's web site.</p>

I get back an encrypted byte array as a result. Is it possible to perform the same operation using openssl?</p>

<p>I tried using opensal as follows:</p>

<pre><code>openssl rsautl -encrypt -in symkey.data -out symkey.enc -pubin rsaPub.der -keyform DER -pkcs

symkey.data: 192 bits DES3 key

</code></pre>

<p>The resulting symkey.enc file is 128 bytes in size, but the result from my hardware is always 256 bytes. I suppose it's about padding but not sure.</p>
","<p><strong>To answer your specific case:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3447.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">RFC3447</a> says that RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 encryption scheme can operate on messages of length up to k - 11 octets (k is the octet length of the RSA modulus) so there is no way you can use 128bit RSA key to encrypt 192bit DES3 key. OpenSSL would end up with the following error:</p>

<pre><code>openssl rsautl -encrypt -in symkey.data -out symkey.enc -pubin -inkey rsaPub.der -keyform DER -pkcs

</code></pre>

<p>Are you sure that you have provided correct information in your question?</p>

<p><strong>To answer key wrapping with OpenSSL in general:</strong></p>

<p>Yes it is possible to wrap/unwrap DES3 key with the RSA key using OpenSSL. Mechanism CKM_RSA_PKCS you are using with your PKCS#11 library identifies RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 encryption scheme (RSA encryption with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding) which is fully supported by OpenSSL.</p>

<p>You can easily check out that my answer is correct with the command line OpenSSL tool and a few lines of code that use PKCS#11 library:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Generate RSA key pair:</p>

<pre><code>openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Extract RSA public key from generated RSA key pair:</p>

","<p>I don't understand why you want to do this, yet PKCS#11 is not a windows things, CSP is, though some apps use PKCS#11 like Mozilla but I really recommend if you wanna do a PKCS#11, do it in C or C++ just for the code to be portable to other platforms, this might need tweaking (#if #else) of course but the main logic code will stay the same and really PKCS#11 is linux/unix/bsd/macosx thing .. also  C# can't generate a stdlib , I assume it generates a COM/COM+ object which is totally different than a C library for PKCS#11 .. </p>

"15503514","SSL Client Authentication with smart card works in Java 6 but fails in Java 7","<p>the following code creates a client authenticated SSL context using PKCS#11 device (smart card). It all works great with Java 6:</p>

<pre><code>// Configure the SunPkcs11 provider
String pkcs11config;
pkcs11config = ""name = Cryptoki"";
pkcs11config += ""\nlibrary = /SCDriver/libbit4ipki.dylib"";
InputStream confStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(pkcs11config.getBytes());
SunPKCS11 sunpkcs11 = new SunPKCS11(confStream);
Security.addProvider(sunpkcs11);

// Specify keystore builder parameters for PKCS#11 keystores
Builder scBuilder = Builder.newInstance(""PKCS11"", sunpkcs11, new KeyStore.CallbackHandlerProtection(new PasswordRetriever()));

// Create and init KeyManagerFactory
KeyManagerFactory factory = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance(""NewSunX509"");
factory.init(new KeyStoreBuilderParameters(scBuilder));

// create and init ssl context
m_ssl_context = SSLContext.getInstance(""TLS"");
m_ssl_context.init(factory.getKeyManagers(), new TrustManager[] {new PkTrustManager()}, null);      
SSLContext.setDefault(m_ssl_context);
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>PkTrustManager</em> is simply and 'empty' class, taking any server/client certificate for good, and <em>PasswordRetriever</em> just asks for password through a dialog box
(By request I post source code for these).
On Java 7 instead I get the following exception during SSL handshake of the ssl context:</p>

<pre><code>java.security.InvalidKeyException: Class does not represent an RSA key: sun.security.pkcs11.P11Key$P11PrivateKey

</code></pre>

<p>In the best case, I'd say something has changed in Java internals, but checking the Oracle documentation, I didn't find any supposed changes on the NewSunX509 key manager, or other components. I double checked the code and it seems compliant to the specifications (through there's for sure something I missed!).</p>

<p>I tried to add the configuration flags:</p>

<pre><code>System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType"", ""pkcs11"");
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.keyStore"", ""NONE"");
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType"", ""pkcs11"");
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStore"", ""NONE"");
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.keyStoreProvider"", sunpkcs11.getName() );
JCEMapper.setProviderId(sunpkcs11.getName());
</code></pre>

<p>But no change, same error... and they are not required in Java 6 where all works.
Thanks in advance anyone can help or has any ideas!</p>

<p>I have a Smart Card SD card from Giesecke &amp; Devrient, with Java Card OS and fine applets and dev tools. I also recieved an android service to communicate with the card (the applets) with APDUs. This is quite low-level, it acceps byte codes as commands and data.</p>

<p>I need to call a web-service via SSL authentication. Now I know that SSL uses (can use) hardware tokens with PKCS#11 interfaces.</p>

<p>So the questions again:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can the Android SSL implementation use (custom) PKCS#11 interfaces in some way, if yes, how? (e.g. possibly with some security providers)</li>
<li>Can I use OpenSC (and other stuff mentioned in the linked guide) <em>without</em> patching the OS (e.g. extract the libs and include it in my application)?</li>
<li>Overall, how should I link the gap between the low-level smart card and the high level SSL? I kindly ask you for any material regarding this.</li>
</ul>
","<p>If you can access your card without patching the ROM, you can roll your own (requires knowledge of cryptography) SSL implementation on top of it.</p>

<p>If not, then AFAIK you need to patch Android to get access to the extra hardware. And the built-in SSL library has no support whatsoever for client-side ""hardware tokens"" AFAIK.</p>

<p>So the questions again:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can the Android SSL implementation use (custom) PKCS#11 interfaces in some way, if yes, how? (e.g. possibly with some security providers)</li>
<li>Can I use OpenSC (and other stuff mentioned in the linked guide) <em>without</em> patching the OS (e.g. extract the libs and include it in my application)?</li>
<li>Overall, how should I link the gap between the low-level smart card and the high level SSL? I kindly ask you for any material regarding this.</li>
</ul>
","<p>As this is a special form of a Smart-Card encapsulated inside a microSD-card I assume that the API bases on special SD-Card read and write operations. Such operation may or may not be usable on Android without root access.</p>

<p>That depends on the certain implementation of the API. Usually such a microSD card already comes with Android libraries (as it is the most open relevant mobile platform) from the vendor. You should ask there for getting more information.</p>

"9220265","Android SSL with a Smart Card through PKCS#11","<p>The reason that this question was born is that I am totally lost, so please forgive the trivial and senseless parts.</p>

<p>I have an Android app, a web-service, a MicroSD smart card (mobile security card). I need to know how can I use the card with ssl to securely communicate with the web-service. Rebuilding and flashing the OS is not an option.</p>

<p>What I know:</p>

<ul>
<li>The API used to communicate with the MSC</li>
<li>How to write/deploy applets to the MSC</li>
<li>How to call a web-service</li>
</ul>

<p>What I don't know:</p>

<ul>
<li>SSL</li>
<li>Too much about certificates and cryptography (only shady academic stuff from the university)</li>
<li>How things come together and what should I use to accomplish this</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/seek-for-android/wiki/SmartCardPKI"" rel=""nofollow"">seek-for-android</a> has an OpenSC tutorial and library, but the OS needs to be patched for that. Is there a way to avoid that and still use the solution?</p>

<p>I know I could be much further into this with a little research, but my deadline is quite close (a few days), so I need help, much help, and very soon.. Thank you in advance!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>More specifically:</p>

<p>I have a Smart Card SD card from Giesecke &amp; Devrient, with Java Card OS and fine applets and dev tools. I also recieved an android service to communicate with the card (the applets) with APDUs. This is quite low-level, it acceps byte codes as commands and data.</p>

<p>I need to call a web-service via SSL authentication. Now I know that SSL uses (can use) hardware tokens with PKCS#11 interfaces.</p>

<p>There is a project called <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/seek-for-android/wiki/SmartCardPKI"" rel=""nofollow"">seek-for-android</a> with a guide to patch the OS and have a standard PKCS#11 interface over the smart card (I believe this would be OpenSC). I CAN'T patch the OS.</p>

<p>Do this also happen to someone else? Any solution?</p>
","<p>I noticed looking at the javadoc for <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/security/Provider.html#configure-java.lang.String-"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>configure</code></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apply the supplied configuration argument to this provider instance and return the configured provider. Note that if this provider cannot be configured in-place, <strong>a new provider will be created and returned</strong>. Therefore, callers should always use the returned provider.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This indicates to me that the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_pattern"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">prototype pattern</a> is being used here, and that the new control flow for creating multiple providers would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>Provider prototype = Security.getProvider(""SunPKCS11"");
Provider provider1 = prototype.configure(...);
Provider provider2 = prototype.configure(...);
...
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>As for using arguments directly instead of a filename, I did some digging into the source code and found this in <code>sun.security.pkcs11.Config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Config(String fn) throws IOException {
    this.filename = fn;
    if (filename.startsWith(""--"")) {
        // inline config
        String config = filename.substring(2).replace(""\\n"", ""\n"");
        reader = new StringReader(config);
</code></pre>

<p>Note the line with <code>filename.startsWith(""--"")</code>, this filename comes directly from the argument to <code>configure</code>. So you <em>should</em> be able to pass in the configuration arguments as a string as long as you start the string with <code>--</code>, and then delimiting your <code>key=value</code> pairs with <code>\n</code>. (I am not currently able to test this though).</p>

<p>However, I can't find this fact publicly documented anywhere, so it might be subject to change, as well as it working differently for different providers, i.e. <strong><em>use at own risk!</em></strong>.</p>

","<p>SunPKCS11 provider is present only in 32-bit Windows version of JRE up until JRE7. Since JRE8 it is present also in 64-bit Windows version of JRE. This is the information you see in <a href=""http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/131"" rel=""nofollow"">JEP131</a>.</p>

<p>If you need to use PKCS#11 API in 64-bit Windows version of JRE older than JRE8 then you will have to use one of alternative 3rd party implementations - such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAIK-JCE"" rel=""nofollow"">IAIK-JCE</a>.</p>

<p>I have also noticed in your code sample that you are trying to directly use ""j2pkcs11.dll"" as a PKCS#11 library which is wrong because it is just a JNI wrapper sitting between JRE and the library implementing PKCS#11 interface.

<p>Is there a way to do this signing without asking the user for this location. I am OK with a solution which only works with just IE and Firefox on Windows.</p>

<p>With a few smartcards/cryptokens I have used, I have noticed that the moment I insert it, I can see the certificate in IE &amp; Firefox's personal tab of certificates. This probably means that the crypto token registers all the certificates it contains with OS when you insert the card and deregisters it when you remove it. So it must probably be exposing some interface to the OS/Browser when it does it - can this not be used for signing?</p>
","<p>We did the thing you are trying to do now (distributed signing with client-side modules) within Distributed Cryptography add-on for our SecureBlackox product and we offer ActiveX control for IE and Java applet for other browsers. </p>

<p>Unfortunately PKCS#11 DLLs are not registered anywhere so you can't avoid asking the user about location of this DLL. </p>

<p>Most hardware devices support both PKCS#11 and CryptoAPI interfaces. Within CryptoAPI interface the CSP DLL exposes hardware-based certificates to CryptoAPI engine and thus to applications. In this case you can use Java classes that work with Windows CryptoAPI.</p>

<p>PKCS#11 is an interface, implemented by hardware vendors, so Java can't implement it's own - JVM is not a hardware and doesn't contain certificates (even if it did, that would not solve your problem). I need to notice, that Firefox has built-in PKCS#11 driver via which Firefox accesses its own certificates.  This was done for uniform support for software- and hardware-stored certificates. </p>

","<p>Smartcard or Token driver (PKCS#11) library has an additional layer called CSP (Crypto Service Provider) which acts like bridge between the device driver and OS Crypto services.  Token driver, once installed also adds this CSP and thus plunging the token or smartcard makes Certificates in it available (which acts as handle to private key stored securely on the crypto device).</p>

<p>For signing from Browser as client, applets are no more supported by modern browsers. You may use Browser Extension for the purposes which has a native application running behind the browser to access Certificate Store and provide signing function through JavaScript in the browser.

<p>There are two PINs on a card.</p>

<ol>
<li>Card PIN. Used to unlock the card and read the certificates. You can handle this PIN with your own callback. PIN is only needed once.</li>
<li>Signature PIN. Used to access the qualified signature certificate. This PIN must be entered for each signature. The PIN dialog is from the Siemens middleware and you cannot dismiss it.</li>
</ol>

<p>In most cases both PINs are the same (else the users gets confused). 
I also have a card without signature PIN. With this I can sign without another PIN entry. Maybe you can remove the signature PIN or get a card without signature PIN.</p>

"804676","Using a hardware token for login","<p>I am new to the topic of cryptography and am studying PKI and PKCS etc. I understand the basic concept of PKI and how it is used for encryption/decryption. I am confused however about how a hardware token like a USB token or a smartcard is used for secure login to your computer. Here are steps as I understand them and the part I am confused by (sorry in advance for the question length):</p>

<p>Scenario: Computer xyz on the network contains data that only users who belong to the group SECRET can access. Users Bob and Joe are in this group and have been issued USB tokens that they can use to provide credentials that will enable them to access these resources. The USB token employs two-factor authentication and requires a pin to be input. The token is PKCS11 compliant.</p>

<ol>
<li>Bob inserts the USB token into Linux machine</li>
<li>A PAM-PKCS11 module recognizes this event and prompts Bob to enter his pin.</li>
<li>Once Bob correctly enters his 4-digit PIN, the module checks for the validity of the certificate on Bob's token by <strong>(this varies, but what is minimum?)</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Locating the root certificate to check for a trusted CA</li>
<li>Checking certificate validity dates and revocation lists</li>
<li>Matching ID on token against user file <strong>(where?, missing a step)</strong> or directory (LDAP, etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If all looks good, module informs PAM of the successful result.</li>
<li>This line is labeled sufficient so PAM accepts authentication and Bob is logged in and can view information restricted to users from the SECRET group.</li>
</ol>

<p>The part I am missing is where is the information stored about whether or not Bob can access this machine and how exactly he is tied to Bob the network (or even desktop) user. I understand that other identifying data about Bob will be stored on the USB including an ID (e.g., email address). However, how is this strong security? Where is crypto being employed during the login process, if at all (or is that not the real purpose of these tokens)? If someone gets hold of the USB and knows the 4-digit pin, that appears to be all that is needed, right? Moreover, is it essentially the trust in the CA that allows is to trust that another user can't get a new USB token and use a trusted CA to get a new certificate but specify all identifying data to be the same as Bob's? I know there is some critical part I am missing .. but after reading dozens of articles, explanation of this area seems glossed over.  Is it a good idea to use a hardware token as a sufficient means for authentication to login to a machine containing sensitive data?  Or is the purpose of such tokens primarily to securely store key pairs that are used in other applications?Thanks for your help!</p>
","<p>PAM (as the name suggests) only handles Authentication.  Authentication is about proving who the user is, i.e. ""Prove to me who are who you say you are.""  This is seperate from Authorization which is, i.e. ""Do you have access to this resource?"".</p>

<p>There are three aspects to Authentication:<br/>
1. I Know<br/>
2. I Have<br/>
3. I Am<br/></p>

<p>A typical username/password combination fits into 1.  While a token, or other PKCS device, fits into 2, and biometrics such as iris recognition or fingerprint reading fits into number three.</p>

<p>The more of these aspects you have in your security the better/tighter the security is.  In this case the login fits into 1 and 2 so is more secure than just a user name and passowrd.  If someone was to get his pin out of him and steal his device then yes it won't proove that it is bob using it.  But then neither would it if Bob gave his username and password to someone either.</p>

<p>The point of the token is to introduce the second factor of ""having"" something, the fact that you also need a PIN means that ""knowing"" something is also required.  So the system can then have more confidence that the person is who they claim to be.</p>

<p>The missing part you are referring to is <em>Authorization</em> this as stated is a seperate process to Authentication and happens only after the user has authenticated themselves.  In this case PAM has Authenticated Bob and provided confirmation to the OS that Bob is indeed using the system.  However, the OS would then have to perform some other check in step 5 to confirm that Bob had access to the resource.  </p>

<p>How does a user access HSM internal memory for performing different operations with it?</p>
","<p>The HSM vendor should have provided you a library. You can use this library to interact with your HSM via PKCS#11 interface. You will need the PKCS#11 header files in you project in order to do that.

<p>How does a user access HSM internal memory for performing different operations with it?</p>
","<p>Every HSM vendor supports at least one cryptographic API. PKCS#11 is a particularly common choice, but there are many other options. OpenSSL, for example, supports HSMs through an <a href=""http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/engine.html"">engine interface</a>.</p>

<p>Often the vendor will expose a proprietary API in addition to the ""standard"" APIs it implements. The proprietary API typically offers a greater degree of control over key security properties and key usage than is possible to express in the standard APIs.</p>

<p>When using an HSM, one typically issues a command to load a key from a secure store and retrieve a <em>handle</em> to the key object. This handle is the layer of abstraction that allows the HSM to perform the key operations securely without exposing the key material.</p>

<p>With regards to your project, it is important that you don't simply ""shove"" the HSM somewhere in your solution to make it appear secure. Instead, think long and hard about the security properties of your system and how cryptography may help you defend against attacks. Once you've identified your attack vectors (and your associated cryptographic defences), then consider which cryptographic API can support your use cases. Only then should you select the best vendor from those who support that API.</p>

<p>In my experience, the standard APIs only suffice for simple security systems. For complex projects, it's almost always necessary to work with the proprietary API of a particular vendor. In such cases, lean heavily on the vendor for support and proof-of-concepts before settling on a product that truly meets your needs.</p>

"14445460","PKCS11 deriveKey() and encrypt() returning different results for 3DES","<p>I am working on a key derivation problem using an HSM and PKCS11 and currently I can't understand why I see completely different results depending on whether I use the deriveKey() method as opposed to using the encrypt() method.  In both cases I'm attempting to use DESede/ECB/NoPadding algorithm for the result and yet depending on which method (deriveKey vs. encrypt) I use to generate the result, I see different outcomes.</p>

<p>Stepping back for a moment to give a high level overview... I am using a specific key derivation methodology used by Global Platform to diversify the master key for use on a smart card.  The method starts with a master key and 8 bytes of data (diversification data) that are used to derive the new key.  The div data bytes are literally just encrypted with the master key using DESede/ECB/NoPadding and the result is used as part of the new derived 3DES key.  (In actuality, there are multiple encryptions performed and the results are concatenated together to form the new key, but that is not the issue here.)</p>

<p>I've verified the master key in both cases, verified that the diversification data is the same in both cases, verified that I'm using the same algorithm with the same padding.  I've also tried changing the derived key template to DES, 2DES, 3DES.  All yield similar results that only differ in length.</p>

<p>Currently I've implemented my test case using IAIK wrapper (a pkcs11 wrapper written in Java), which I will post here.  The key is just a test key and the div data is sample div data, so there is no sensitive information here.  I'm first creating a base key in the HSM, then attempt to derive a new key by calling session.deriveKey() using the diversification data.  The derived key bytes are printed in hex (the key value is incorrect, based on my currently working implementation that derives the key in memory instead of within the HSM).  Next, I simply initialize the session to perform an encryption using the master key and then encrypt the diversification data.  This yields the expected value (again, checked against a working implementation).</p>

<p>What I'm looking for is any insight into why these operations are yielding different results, when I'm using the same base key, the same div data and the same encryption algorithm.  I don't understand what deriveKey() is doing under the surface and I'm unable to find any documentation or source code to shed any light on this.  I must be able to use the deriveKey() method since the derived key will not be available outside the HSM.</p>

<p>Any insight appreciated.</p>

","<p>Turns out that the key generated in the HSM using DeriveKey and the key bytes I generated using session.encrypt() are essentially the same if one considers how DES parity works.</p>

<p>The least significant bit of each byte in a DES key is the parity bit, which is ignored in many implementations and is not used as part of the key, thus if I properly set the parity bits on my encrypt result then both results match.</p>

"3300346","How to access a smartcard in Java on Linux?","<p>I'm trying to access a smartcard on a linux system on a VM. The USB device is mapped to the VM and can be listed via lsusb (ID 076b:3021 OmniKey AG CardMan 3121). I can access the smartcard via pkcs11-tool and pkcs15-tool. Also firefox can access the token via the /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so library. </p>

<p>But when I try to access the smartcard from Java, an empty keystore is returned. I'm using the following configuration for the sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11 provider. </p>

<pre><code>name = PKCS11Test
library = /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so
slot = 0
</code></pre>

<p>When using a different slot (I tried slot 0-15), I get CKR_PIN_INCORRECT errors or ""PKCS11 not found"". In my tests I'm loading the keystore like this:</p>

<pre><code>char[] pin = ""123456"".toCharArray();
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS11"", p);
ks.load(null, pin);
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand the pkcs11-tool returned for slot 0:</p>

<p><code>
Slot 0           CCID Compatible<br>
token model:   PKCS#15 emulated
</code></p>

<p>As Java seems to access the card on slot 0 (at least no error is returned), I'm probably doing something else wrong in accessing the keystore. How can I access the private key?</p>
","<p>Okay, I found the solution.</p>

<p>Why ever, the slot 0 seems to be empty at all. Slot 1 and 2 have private keys, but were protected with different (local) PINs. With the netkey-tool I was able to set the local PIN to the global PIN. Afterwards accessing the card worked without a flaw. </p>

Thanks</p>
","<p>In order to work with <code>PKCS#11</code> in java you need to provide a config file where you at least specify library and name parameter. In this parameters you must specify the path to native library for the token and a arbitrary identifier. Additionally you can add more parameters but they are optional, you can take a look on <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html#Config"" rel=""nofollow"">java pkcs#11 reference guide</a>. I give you a code sample to instantiate a <code>PKCS#11</code>:</p>

<pre><code>// create configuration
String pkcs11nativeLibrary = ""/path_to_native_library/library.so"";
String pkcs11ConfigSettings = ""name = mySmartCard\n"" + ""library = "" + pkcs11nativeLibrary;
byte[] pkcs11ConfigBytes = pkcs11ConfigSettings.getBytes();
final ByteArrayInputStream confStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(pkcs11ConfigBytes);

// instantiate the provider with your config
SunPKCS11 pkcs11Provider = new SunPKCS11(confStream);
Security.addProvider(pkcs11Provider);

// get the keystore
Char[] pkcs11Password = ""your_password"".toCharArray();
KeyStore myPKCS11KS = KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS11"", pkcs11Provider );
myPKCS11KS.load(null, pkcs11Password);
</code></pre>

<p>In the sample I put the pkcs11 password directly, however when you try to load a PKCS#11 from some client you have to get the password dinamically in order to do so you can change you key store instance for something like:</p>

<pre><code>// YourCallbackHandler must implements javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler
KeyStore.CallbackHandlerProtection cbhp = new KeyStore.CallbackHandlerProtection(new YourCallbackHandler());
KeyStore.Builder builder = KeyStore.Builder.newInstance(""PKCS11"", pkcs11Provider, cbhp);
KeyStore myPKCS11KS = builder.getKeyStore();

Casual smart cards on the other hand have also contactless interfaces and can be used with pinpad readers which provide higher security than USB tokens.</p>

","<p><code>pycrypto</code> is a low-level module that gives you all the pieces you need to build a cryptosystem, not a complete cryptosystem implementation.</p>

<p>Also, <code>pycrypto</code> doesn't have PKCS#11 support. And neither do the major alternatives. Even if you use one of the OpenSSL wrappers, normal builds of OpenSSL themselves don't have PKCS#11 support compiled in. You need to specify a .dll/.so/.dylib implementing PKCS#11 for your specific hardware (or multiple such libs) at configure time and build OpenSSL.</p>

<p>On top of that, if you're doing PKCS#11, one of the pieces you probably need is a way to interface with smartcards and other hardware token, and <code>pycrypto</code> doesn't do that part at all.</p>

<p>states that a method with the signature <code>void C_Initialize(Object o, boolean b)</code> should be called and doesn't exist. And you're right with your guess <code>so i am guessing there is something wrong with pkcs11wrapper.dll.</code> Based on the Javadoc this method signature has been changed
<a href=""http://javadoc.iaik.tugraz.at/pkcs11_wrapper/current/iaik/pkcs/pkcs11/wrapper/PKCS11.html#C_Initialize%28java.lang.Object,%20boolean%29"" rel=""nofollow"">PKCS#11 Wrapper version 1.3</a> and <a href=""http://javadoc.iaik.tugraz.at/pkcs11_wrapper/1.2.15/iaik/pkcs/pkcs11/wrapper/PKCS11.html#C_Initialize%28java.lang.Object%29"" rel=""nofollow"">PKCS#11 Wrapper version 1.2.15</a> (could not find one for 1.2.17).</p>

<p>So your DDL <code>pkcs11wrapper.dll</code> is for an older version. You can check the version in the file properties menu under Windows.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>
Seems the dll from version 1.2.17 is somewhere in the java.library.path. I did following tests with the GetInfo.java from iaikPkcs11Wrapper archive.</p>

"21891330","PKCS11 Import Encrypted PKCS1 RSA Private Key","<p>I have a simple straight question: Can an encrypted PKCS1 RSAPrivateKey be imported into a PKCS11 compatible security module without exposing the private key in the client's memory?</p>

<p>I know that PKCS11 explicitly mentions PKCS8's PrivateKeyInfo as the required private key format in order to import it in through the C_UnwrapKey function.</p>

<p>Any help please! </p>
","<p>Whether private key is exposed in the host memory during the unwrapping fully depends on the implementation of your PKCS#11 module.</p>

<p>RSA keys are usually wrapped with symmetric keys (i.e. AES) and sadly many PKCS#11 modules shipped with common smartcards implement symmetric encryption algorithms in software. Unwrapping in such cases consists of two steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>software based decryption of key material which is stored in the host memory</li>
<li>import of decrypted key material into the device</li>
</ol>

<p>However there are also PKCS#11 implementations (and devices) that implement symmetric encryption algorithms in hardware and these are capable of performing unwrapping of RSA keys without exposing private key into the host memory.</p>

<p>You can use C_GetMechanismInfo() function to find out whether your PKCS#11 module performs specific algorithm in hardware or not. Just examine the ""flags"" member of returned CK_MECHANISM_INFO structure for the presence of CKF_HW flag.</p>

<p><strong>Edit: PKCS#1 to PKCS#8 conversion</strong></p>

<p>As far as I know PKCS#11 does not specify any standard method for PKCS#1 key unwrapping or conversion. Also the last time I have worked with Luna SA HSM there was a statement in the documentation that it expects imported key material to be in PKCS#8 format.</p>

<p>You can try to convert PKCS#1 key to PKCS#8 in software, but I am afraid it won't be possible without decryption of private key into the host memory. It is rather easy to convert unencrypted PKCS#1 key to the PKCS#8 one - you just insert PKCS#1 RSAPrivateKey sequence into the PKCS#8 PrivateKeyInfo sequence, specify version, privateKeyAlgorithm and you are done. But to convert encrypted PKCS#1 key (whole RSAPrivateKey sequence is encrypted) you first need to decrypt it, convert it to PKCS#8 PrivateKeyInfo sequence, then encrypt PKCS#8 PrivateKeyInfo sequence, insert encrypted PrivateKeyInfo into EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo sequence and specify encryptionAlgorithm.</p>

<p><code>Esteid-pkcs11</code> file is a country-specific dll-file. I have read lot of responses on google to problems that resulted with the same error, but none of the replies seem to do the trick. I have installed JDK(64-bit) and JRE(32-bit). I thought that maybe the <code>.dll</code> file I tried opening is 32-bit and so I changed <code>JAVA_HOME</code> path to point to 32-bit JRE, but then it said something like </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>cannot load IA 32-bit .dll on a amd 64-bit platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I figured that it isn't a problem with bits. After messing around with environment variables for few hours I figured that it might be a problem with the bank-made script. Can that be the case? If not what else is there that can cause this error?</p>

<p>Edit: Apparently I tried using C-library for signing and it works, but when using Java-library, it gives me an error.</p>

<p><code>java.io.IOException: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.

<p>As you can see there is no exception thrown when encrypting using generated des key.</p>
","<p>If you perform encryption using a HSM then the encryption procedure is performed within the HSM, not in the software. <code>Cipher</code> does not implement the encryption procedure itself. The underlying <code>CipherSpi</code> of the PKCS#11 provider for <code>Cipher</code> is chosen using <em>delayed provider selection</em> depending on the key given during the call to <code>init()</code>. So although the <code>desEncrypt()</code> function seems to perform the same operations, in reality the functionality depends on the provider, and in your case, on the PKCS#11 wrapper, library and of course HSM.</p>

<p>Now PKCS#11 is an interface specification; not all mechanisms in PKCS#11 will be implemented in every token. It is likely that some encryption algorithms are too obscure or too unsafe. The latter is probably the case for DES ECB as that algorithm is extremely insecure. That does not mean that DES keys cannot be used in general - they could still play a role in e.g. MAC calculations. So please check the documentation of your HSM if DES ECB is supported (in the current setting).</p>

<p>You can get more information about the PKCS#11 method calls by adding <code>-Djava.security.debug=sunpkcs11</code> to your call to the Java interpreter (<code>java</code> or <code>javaw</code>). If DES does not work, try the much safer and more common <code>""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding""</code> or triple DES mechanism.</p>

<p>I would appreciate any hints to solve this problem, thanks...</p>
","<p>According to the PKCS#11, X509 certificates are some kind of stored objects that their data class (<code>CKA_CLASS</code> attribute) equals to <code>CKO_CERTIFICATE</code>.<br/>
If you want to retrieve a certificate object from your token, all you need is to use <code>C_GetAttributeValue</code> function.<br/>
Before doing this you may want find all x.509 certificates stored on your token:<br/></p>

<pre><code>CK_BBOOL _true = CK_TRUE;
CK_OBJECT_CLASS certClass = CKO_CERTIFICATE;
CK_CERTIFICATE_TYPE certType = CKC_X_509_ATTR_CERT;
CK_ATTRIBUTE certificateSearchTemplate[] = {
    {CKA_CLASS, &amp;certClass, sizeof(dataClass)},
    {CKA_CERTIFICATE_TYPE, &amp;certType, sizeof(certType)},
    {CKA_TOKEN, &amp;_true, sizeof(_true)}
};

CK_OBJECT_HANDLE hObject;
CK_ULONG ulObjectCount;
CK_RV rv = C_FindObjectsInit(hSession, certificateSearchTemplate, 3);
assert(rv == CKR_OK);
while (1) {
   rv = C_FindObjects(hSession, &amp;hObject, 1, &amp;ulObjectCount);
   if (rv != CKR_OK || ulObjectCount == 0)
      break;
   //hObject is handle of a x.509 certificate, so you can fetch your desired attributes from it using C_GetAttributeValue
  getCertificateAttributes(hObject);
}
rv = C_FindObjectsFinal(hSession);
assert(rv == CKR_OK);
</code></pre>

<p>and in <code>getCertificateAttributes</code> function you can get desired certificate attributes:</p>

<pre><code>void getCertificateAttributes(CK_OBJECT_HANDLE hCert)
{
   CK_ATTRIBUTE pTemplate[] = {
      //List your desired attributes here
   };
   ...
   CK_RV rv = C_GetAttributeValue(hSession, hCert, &amp;pTemplate, pTemplateLen);
   if (rv == CKR_OK) {
      //here you have your desired certificate attributes
   }
}

","<p>Apart from PKCS#11 library, <strong>Microsoft CryptoAPI</strong>(mscapi.dll) can also be used for retrieving certificate details.

"19130717","IAIK PCKS11Provider VS IAIK PKCS11Wrapper key generation","<p>I would like to understand the difference between generating RSA 2048 bit keys through IAIK PKCS11Wrapper, where I am using the example class named <code>GenerateKeyPair.java</code>, and IAIK PKCS11Provider which also uses IAIK PKCS11Wrapper and generate key pair through example class named <code>KeyPairGeneratorDemo.java</code>.</p>

<p>I am using the above libraries and classes with USB token ACS CryptoMate64.</p>

<p>When I use PKCS11Wrapper and load my pkcs11.dll everything works fine. Key pair is generated.</p>

<p>But when I am trying to do the same through IAIK PKCS11Provider class, it is throwing an exception when trying to generate key pair <code>keyPair_ = keyPairGenerator.generateKeyPair();</code>:</p>

<p>What's the difference between these two approaches? And why is key pair generation through IAIK PKCS11Provider throwing CKR_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_INVALID?

","<p><code>RSA/ECB/OAEPWITHSHA256ANDMGF1PADDING</code> and <code>RSA/ECB/OAEPWITHSHA-256ANDMGF1PADDING</code> are different alias but both refers to the same algorithms, so in this sense there is not difference at all.</p>

<p>The thing is that you're using a <code>PKCS#11</code> (cryptographic token interface) to cipher your data. According to java <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>PKCS#11</code> reference</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Sun PKCS#11 provider, in contrast to most other providers, <strong>does not implement cryptographic algorithms itself.</strong>
  Instead, it acts as a bridge between the Java JCA and JCE APIs and the
  native PKCS#11 cryptographic API, translating the calls and
  conventions between the two. This means that Java applications calling
  standard JCA and JCE APIs can, without modification, take advantage of
  algorithms offered by the underlying PKCS#11 implementations, such as,
  for example,</p>
  
  <p>Cryptographic Smartcards, Hardware cryptographic accelerators, and
  High performance software implementations. <strong>Note that Java SE only
  facilitates accessing native PKCS#11 implementations, it does not
  itself include a native PKCS#11 implementation</strong>. However, cryptographic
  devices such as Smartcards and hardware accelerators often come with
  software that includes a PKCS#11 implementation, which you need to
  install and configure according to manufacturer's instructions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Summarized, if you're using a <code>PKCS#11</code>, the use of the algorithms depends on vendors native implementation (<code>.dll</code> on windows, <code>.so</code> on linux ...) and some times on specific program connector so: check if in the both PCs you're using the same drivers/program version for your <code>PKCS#11</code> token and the both are correctly installed because probably there is an error in one of them which doesn't allows you to use <code>RSA/ECB/OAEPWITHSHA-256ANDMGF1PADDING</code> correctly.</p>

<p>Hope this helps,</p>

","<p>Even though you add 2 providers to the list of providers, the <code>SunPKCS11</code> class caches the first instance. It seems like it always uses this instance all the time. That's the reason your second provider is not picked up/identified.</p>

<p>You might have to write some sneaky code to approach your use case. Right before you use your second provider, you have to clear the cached instance. You can refer to this <a href=""https://community.oracle.com/thread/3676303"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">post</a> here. It is unanswered, but the code you should be looking for is</p>

<pre><code>Field moduleMapField = PKCS11.class.getDeclaredField(""moduleMap"");  
moduleMapField.setAccessible(true);  
Map&lt;?, ?&gt; moduleMap = (Map&lt;?, ?&gt;) moduleMapField.get(&lt;YOUR_FIRST_PROVIDER_INSTANCE&gt;);  
moduleMap.clear(); // force re-execution of C_Initialize next time

<p>What this basically does is clearing the cached instance. And now you can proceed to add your second provider instance to interact with your second token.</p>

"15244318","What is a ""mechanism"" in PKCS11?","<p>What does <em>mechanism</em> mean in PKCS11? For example: <code>CKM_RSA_PKCS</code>.</p>

<p>What is the difference between a mechanism (<code>CKM_RSA_PKCS</code>) and a signature algorithm (<code>NoneWithRSA</code>)?</p>
","<p>A mechanism is a constant value that describes a cryptographic operation. For example, <code>CKM_RSA_PKCS</code> is defined in the PKCS&nbsp;#11 manual as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The PKCS #1 v1.5 RSA mechanism, denoted <strong>CKM_RSA_PKCS</strong>, is a multi-purpose 
  mechanism based on the RSA public-key cryptosystem and the block formats initially 
  defined in PKCS #1 v1.5. It supports single-part encryption and decryption; single-part 
  signatures and verification with and without message recovery; key wrapping; and key 
  unwrapping. This mechanism corresponds only to the part of PKCS #1 v1.5 that 
  involves RSA; it does not compute a message digest or a DigestInfo encoding as 
  specified for the  <code>md2withRSAEncryption</code> and <code>md5withRSAEncryption</code>
  algorithms in PKCS #1 v1.5.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note the ""multi-purpose"" clause - this single mechanism can be used with encryption/decryption as well as signing/verifying.</p>

<p>The Java mechanism <code>NoneWithRSA</code> is <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html#Signature"">defined as</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The RSA signature algorithm which does not use a digesting algorithm (e.g. MD5/SHA1) before performing the RSA operation. For more information about the RSA Signature algorithms, please see PKCS1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Java mechanism is only for signatures.</p>

<p>From the descriptions, it appears a signature computed with <code>NoneWithRSA</code> in Java would be equivalent to a signature computed in PKCS&nbsp;#11 with <code>CKM_RSA_PKCS</code>.</p>

","<p>I'm afraid you can't reliably tell the source of the certificate, at least not on the Java level for the MS CAPI provider. But that's part of the design - MS CAPI more or less intends to encapsulate and hide the origin of certificates/keys.</p>

<p>A safe way to tell that your key/certificate comes from a PKCS#11 device would be using the <a href=""http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">SUN PKCS#11 provider</a>. This, however, has the disadvantage that you would need to specify the path to your native PKCS#11 library either statically (in the java.security file where you can statically configure providers) or dynamically request it as user input.</p>

<p>If using the PKCS#11 provider is too much trouble in your situation, I would suggest implementing a certificate choice dialog that filters for suitable certificates. There is no immediate gain in security by restricting MSCAPI to PKCS#11-originating certificates - there might be a good reason that your user has other certificates/keys installed (often in the form of PKCS#12 files). You should only check (and to help the user already filter certificates reagrding this criterion) that the certificate/key that was finally chosen meets your criteria: correct key usage (e.g. digital signature), sound extended key usage, acceptable or known policies present in the certificates etc. </p>

<p>In the EU we are slowly evolving towards the notion of ""Qualified certificates on a secure signature creation device"". This implies that certificates that are shipped on such a device (e.g. smart card) will contain a special policy, CAs are forbidden to use these policies for any other certificates, for example software certificates. So this would effectively allow you to ensure that a certificate originates from a secure hardware device. You might check if the certificates that are involved support this feature. This <a href=""http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/101800_101899/101862/01.03.02_60/ts_101862v010302p.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">ETSI document</a> lists the corresponding OIDs that you would have to look for.</p>

","<p>In Java key stores, the alias of the key and certificate should be linked. Basically, a private key entry is a private key + certificate chain. So the certificate should always have come from the key store. If the certificate came from the actual token is up to the implementation of the key store of course. The only way of checking if they were actually from the token is to retrieve them using a different method (e.g. reading the bytes of the certificate directly from the token). There is no link back to the storage device for certificates, if that is what you are after.</p>

<p>Of course, it does make sense to check the full chain of certificates up to the root certificate. If the root certificate does not change often, you might consider storing the certificate or a hash over the root certificate in a resource delivered with your application, or distributing it in the standard Java key store.</p>

","<p>According to what you show us the PKCS#11 attribute <code>CKA_SENSITIVE</code> set to false indicates that you <em>should</em> be able to view the value.

If this is true then it <em>should</em> not be possible to set <code>CKA_SENSITIVE</code> to false, but that's IT for you...</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p><strong>Update for ObjectNotFoundException:</strong></p>

<p>You are getting ObjectNotFoundException because there are two private keys with the exactly same label and ID stored in your token and therefore Pkcs11RsaSignature class cannot be sure which one should be used for signature creation. Just delete or rename one of them and it should be working.</p>

The key pair has been imported to the token in slot 0.

","<p>As documented in <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JDK 8 PKCS#11 Reference Guide</a> you need to use <code>slotListIndex</code> attribute instead of <code>slot</code> attribute in the Sun PKCS#11 Provider configuration file.</p>

<p>Following configuration file is working fine for me with the test application you have provided:</p>

<pre><code># Sun PKCS#11 provider configuration file for SoftHSMv2

  <p><strong>Question</strong>: After using C_Logout &amp; C_CloseSession is there a way to reuse same KEY(generated earlier) again by logging back and opening session again with same login credentials?</p>

<p>Yes, just set <code>CKA_TOKEN</code> to <code>CK_TRUE</code> and provide a label using <code>CKA_LABEL</code> to search for it using <code>C_FindObjects</code>. </p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question</strong>: When I use C_CreateObject does it create session object and destroy it on using C_CloseSession?</p>

<p>Well, yes, according to the PKCS#11 specifications (v2.20, 10.4, Table 21):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>CKA_TOKEN</code> is <code>CK_TRUE</code> if object is a token object; <code>CK_FALSE</code> if object is a session

<p>This exception is not because of absence of SunPkcs11 because i see the SunPkcs11 that i added, in the providers list.</p>
","<p>It is hard to find exact solution in this kind of problem because it is hard to reproduce it so according to my reading PKCS#11 is already cover this <strong>Smartcards being inserted and removed</strong> scenario according to its <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html#AppDev"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>, </p>

  <p>This is fine for an application that treats PKCS#11 tokens as static

","<p>TokenD is technically deprecated (as is the entire CDSA subsystem it sits upon) since at OSX 10.7.</p>

<p>It sounds like you want a PKCS#11 module to work with native components, you may want to take a look at Gemalto's PKCS#11 -> TokenD bridge: <a href=""https://smartcardservices.macosforge.org/trac/browser/trunk/Tokend/PKCS11"" rel=""nofollow"">https://smartcardservices.macosforge.org/trac/browser/trunk/Tokend/PKCS11</a></p>

"18244081","how do I use a smart card as KeyStore for client authentication during SSL/TLS?","<p>have been attempting to use a PKCS#11 token (Smart card) as a KeyStore (not the TrustStore) on the client side for client authentication of a TLS connection. However, the SSL handshake fails with a <code>SSLException</code> with the message: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unexpectedly, privatekey is not an RSA private key.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This cannot be true because the private key/certificate pairs on the smart card are RSA keys. Am I missing some configuration to use a smart card as a KeyStore for JSSE? </p>

<p>Here are my configuration details:</p>

<p>Firstly, configured the Sun PKCS#11 Provider to work with an 'ActivCard' dll that interfaces with the smart card. The Sun PKCS#11 Provider configuration file just contains the 'name' and 'library' attributes.</p>

<p>The instantiation of the SunPKCS#11 provider looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>java.security.AuthProvider provider = 
    new sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11.SunPKCS11(&lt;Configuration file&gt;);
</code></pre>

<p>Then, the instantiation of a <code>java.security.KeyStore</code> object from the smart card is done using this code below:</p>

<pre><code>KeyStore.ProtectionParameter thePasswordProtection = 
    new KeyStore.PasswordProtection( null );

KeyStore.Builder theBuilder = 
    KeyStore.Builder.newInstance( ""PKCS11"", provider, thePasswordProtection );

java.security.KeyStore theKeyStore = theBuilder.getKeyStore();
</code></pre>

<p>Moreover, this instantiated <code>KeyStore</code> is used to make a <code>KeyManagerFactory</code> to be used by JSSE using the code below:</p>

<pre><code>KeyManagerFactory kmf = javax.net.ssl.KeyManagerFactory.
    getInstance( ""SunX509"", ""SunJSSE"" );

kmf.init( theKeyStore, &lt;smart card pin&gt; );
</code></pre>

<p>This KeyManagerFactory is used to then initialize an SSLContext which is then used to instantiate an SSLSocket.</p>

<p>As per instructions in <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#PKCS11"" rel=""nofollow"">Oracle's JSSERefGuide for Java 6</a>, this is all I need to do for it to work. Although it is not required to set the below system properties while using the keystores programmatically, I also tried adding the system properties: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType</code> to <code>PKCS11</code>, </li>
<li><code>javax.net.ssl.keyStore</code> to <code>NONE</code> and </li>
<li><code>javax.net.ssl.keyStoreProvider</code> to the name specified for the Sun PKCS#11 provider in its configuration file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any ideas what I am doing wrong here? Any pointers or thoughts would be much appreciated.</p>

","<p>Sun PKCS#11 provider creates a TokenPoller which tries to detect the token addition and removal removal.You can do the same. You can get a reference to the PKCS11 object using the PKCS11.getInstance() method passing in the library path that you used to create the provider. Be careful though, since the library path case has to be the same (its non canoncalized). Call C_GetSlotList on it passing a null. An exception indicates token removal.

","<p>As previously stated, you can use PKCS#11 keying data by using PKCS11KeyingDataProvider. You just need to configure it with the native PKCS#11 lib of your HSM.</p>

<p>The <code>PrivateKey</code> interface is just a marker interface for opaque key representations. When your using the PKCS#11 provider, returned <code>PrivateKey</code> instances are just handles (representatives) of the key, since the key material doesn't actually leave the HSM. The signature engine will be selected using delayed provider selection, accordingly to the <code>PrivateKey</code> provider, since this provider is the one that knows how to handle that specific <code>PrivateKey</code>. In this case, both the key and the signature value calculation are fully handled by the HSM.</p>

<p>XAdES4j's <code>PKCS11KeyingDataProvider</code> is just a wrapper around a Java <code>KeyStore</code> created from a specific PKCS#11 provider instance which is configured with the supplied native lib path.</p>

<p>The issue is that the Microsoft RSA key format is proprietary and doesn't seem to be supported by either pkcs11 or the nCipher HSM my company uses.</p>

<p>If this were just an RSAPrivateKey it would be straightforward to generate the key pair in the HSM, load the wrapping key in the HSM, wrap the RSAPrivateKey and extract the wrapped key bytes.  Obviously since this key blob format isn't supported I need to take a different approach.</p>

<p>My first thought was to extend RSAPrivateKey and override getEncoded() method to return this proprietary key format.  I'm using the IAIK pkcs11 wrapper that provides a high-level API to pkcs11 in Java and there is some support for creating vendor-defined key types.  However, the interface for vendor-defined keys seems to exist only as a convenience to extend the built-in key types in client code and doesn't actually allow one to modify the key encoding within the HSM.</p>

<p>The second idea was to use a pkcs11 data object and simply treat that as the key blob and then encrypt that with the wrapping key.  The same problem here is that in order to copy the private key bytes into the data object, it seems that I need to extract the private key bytes into the application code and then create the data object from there, which defeats the entire point of having the keys in the HSM.</p>

<p>I'm looking for alternatives to these approaches or perhaps there's some feature in pkcs11 I've overlooked that would allow me to do this?  Any insight would be appreciated.</p>
","<p>I agree this looks like a data format not supported by the nShield HSMs (might be worth double-checking that with the <a href=""http://www.thales-esecurity.com/support-landing-page"" rel=""nofollow"">support team</a>, though).</p>

<p>Assuming this is the case, there is only one way to do this securely - one has to use a much lower-level API to load the private key and pass it to some bespoke code running within the HSM (making use of the CodeSafe technology), which would expose the key material, translate it into the necessary format and wrap it with the wrapping key.</p>

<p>Any other approach will result in key exposure on the host. Plus, if you've generated your key with sensible (default) permissions, you can't expose the key anyway without writing bespoke code that utilises your Administrator Card Set.</p>

<p>I would suggest you contact the support team about the issue. You might even get through to some friendly consultants, cough, who could help you with this.</p>

","<p>What you probably want to do is using a PKCS#11 wrapper. I am a little confused wheter you are interacting with the HSM from within Java (since you mention IAIK or .Net since you want to export to a Microsoft RSAPrivateKey). Anyway a PKCS11 wrapper (IAIK for Java, NCryptoki for .Net) will allow you to communicate with the HSM using <a href=""ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-11/v2-30/pkcs-11v2-30b-d6.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">PKCS#11 v2.30</a>, make sure to check supported version in your wrapper and HSM specifications as there might be incompatibilities between versions.</p>

<p>PKCS#11 allows you to generate an RSA key pair within your HSM using the C_GenerateKeyPair function. You will have to specify a Mechanism (RSA_PKCS_KEY_PAIR_GEN) and provide two templates, one for the private key and one for the public key. Make sure that the CKA_WRAP attribute for the private key is set to true.</p>

<p>To load the wrapping key in the HSM the function C_CreateObject can be used in combination with a template.</p>

<p>You could then used the C_WrapKey function to wrap the Private RSA key with the key you imported into the HSM. First use the C_FindObjectsInit, C_FindObjects and C_FindObjectsFinal to retrieve handles to the key to be wrapped and the wrapping key. Then call the C_WrapKey function with the appropriate Mechanism and the two handles.</p>

","<p>If this is an unsupported proprietary format you may have to run proprietary code within the HSM to accomplish this. Many HSM's allow you to run proprietary code, but you will need support from the HSM provider to be able to load the code in the first place. Furthermore, running your own code in a HSM could break security certification (FIPS or Common Criteria).</p>

<p>Otherwise you will have to retrieve the private key from the HSM, put it into the correct format within a secured environment, and wrap it using the normal encryption facilities of the HSM. This will of course expose the private key outside the HSM.</p>

<p>You could also ask Microsoft if they have a preferred solution.</p>

"17066191","Java applet can't access Firefox certificate storage","<p>First of all, I'm relatively new to Java (and not really advanced in programming in general either), so if I missed something obvious, I apologize in advance for wasting your time.</p>

<p>I'm trying to create an applet that would access <strong>Firefox</strong>' certificate store.
What's messed up is that I would swear that this code worked when I wrote it and first tested it; Then I hibernated the PC and upon restart it didn't work anymore and ever since.</p>

<p>It always fails at the very beginning - at <code>KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS11"");</code> with </p>

<pre><code>java.security.KeyStoreException: PKCS11 not found
at java.security.KeyStore.getInstance(Unknown Source)
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>Caused by: java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException: PKCS11 KeyStore not available
at sun.security.jca.GetInstance.getInstance(Unknown Source)
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think there's anything that's relevant in the code, but still, here's the function that fails:</p>

<pre><code>/* Process PDF with Firefox */
private static byte[] processFirefox() throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException, DocumentException {
    KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS11"");
    ks.load(null, ""myPassword"".toCharArray());
    String alias = (String) ks.aliases().nextElement();
    PrivateKey pk = (PrivateKey) ks.getKey(alias,  null);
    Certificate[] chain = ks.getCertificateChain(alias);
    @SuppressWarnings(""unused"")
    TSAClient tsaClient = null;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; chain.length; i++) {
        X509Certificate cert = (X509Certificate)chain[i];
        String tsaUrl = CertificateUtil.getTSAURL(cert);
        if (tsaUrl != null) {
            tsaClient = new TSAClientBouncyCastle(tsaUrl);
            break;
        }
    }
    List&lt;CrlClient&gt; crlList = new ArrayList&lt;CrlClient&gt;();
    crlList.add(new CrlClientOnline(chain));
    return SignPDF.sign(chain, pk, DigestAlgorithms.SHA256, ""PKCS11"", CryptoStandard.CMS, ""A Reason"", ""A Location"", null, null, null, 0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>At first I thought it's because I didn't specify a provider. Then I did and nothing changed. 
What's ""interesting"" is that I also tried running the same applet in Chrome and it gave me the exact same error. So I'm guessing that either the applet cannot access/read Firefox' certificate store or there's something else entirely going on.
The same code, works perfectly if I substitute <code>PKCS11</code> for <code>""Windows-MY"", ""SunMSCAPI""</code> and the password entry for <code>null</code>, so I think it's a problem specific to PKCS11/Firefox.</p>

<p>So there, I could really use some help with this. I've read literally every Google hit on the first couple of pages of search results, but either I'm too green for them to help or they really weren't helpful enough.</p>

<p>If I forgot to add any important piece of info that would help you to help me, please let me know.</p>

<p>Any ideas about how to extend this use to linux and MAC???</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for your help!!</p>
","<p>You can not use <code>SunMSCAPI</code> provider in Linux or MAC OS X, this provider is Windows specific which deals with Windows keystore. If you want to use a Smart Card or Firefox keystore in Linux or MAC OS X through <code>SunPKCS11</code> provider you must get an instance of <code>java.security.KeyStore</code> passing <code>SunPKCS11</code> as provider, like you are doing with <code>SunMSCAPI</code> i.e:</p>

<pre><code>        ByteArrayInputStream confStream = ...// your configuration
        SunPKCS11 pkcs11 = new SunPKCS11(confStream);
        Security.addProvider(pkcs11);
        KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS11"", pkcs11);
        ks.load(null, ""your_pin"".toCharArray());
</code></pre>

<p>With this code you load on the <code>Keystore ks</code> the keys from your configured PKCS11.</p>

<p>There is another way to do it if you want that your PKCS11 pin will be introduced by a third party later. To do so you can initialize your keystore with a <code>java.security.KeyStore.CallbackHandlerProtection</code> parameter like follows:</p>

<pre><code>        ByteArrayInputStream confStream = ...// your configuration
        SunPKCS11 pkcs11 = new SunPKCS11(confStream);
        Security.addProvider(pkcs11);
        KeyStore.CallbackHandlerProtection cbhp = new KeyStore.CallbackHandlerProtection(new PinInputHandler(msg));
        KeyStore.Builder builder = KeyStore.Builder.newInstance(""PKCS11"", pkcs11, cbhp);
        builder.getKeyStore();
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>PinInputHandler</code> in this second sample must implements: <code>javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally in your code seems that you never loads the PKCS11 keys through <code>SunPKCS11</code> provider (even in Windows case) because you are not instantiating a keystore with <code>SunPKCS11</code> you are only adding it as a provider with <code>Security.addProvider</code> method and always you are instantiating only a keystore with <code>SunMSCAPI</code>, however probably in Windows you are getting some of your Smart cards keys because if you install Windows drivers for you smart card you can get their keys through Windows keystore.</p>

<p>Hope this helps,</p>

","<p>PKCS#11 is an API definition in C to use cryptographic tokens. It explicitly does not specify any implementation details of these cryptographic tokens. In principle any security and software module may be represented by a PKCS#11 interface. So it depends completely on the PKCS#11 middleware on how the smart card is accessed. The same goes for things as logging by the PKCS#11 module - PKCS#11 does not specify how logging is performed.</p>

<p>Now most smart cards that are used for signature generation are compatible with at least ISO 7816-4 (which defines which APDU's may be used to read/write to the card and how some cryptographic APDU's may be used). Futhermore, they <em>may</em> implement ISO 7816-15 (a slightly different version of PKCS#15), which is a quite complex standard to find files and objects (such as keys) on the card. Normally these cards are accessed through PCSC, so it is best to try and get a log of the PCSC or smart card reader driver API calls.</p>

<p>With Java you can also directly use the card through <code>javax.smartcardio</code> which implements ISO 7816-4 compatible transport over PCSC. In that case you will have to implement the entire application level interface to the smart card though.</p>

<p>This is unfortunately a long text to say that this all depends on the implementation of the PKCS#11 library and the smart card. </p>

","<p>SlotID (in your case specified by <code>slot</code> variable) is unsigned long integer and it is up to the PKCS#11 library creator to choose what exact value will be used so it may be very hard to just guess the correct value.

","<p>The keystore used by your JVM is irrelevant in your case. Your keys are stored on your eToken. It's that keystore that you are trying to load when you use these lines:</p>

<pre><code>KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS11"", providerPKCS11);
ks.load(null, K.PASS_TOKEN);
</code></pre>

<p>Hence your question 1 is irrelevant. By the way: when I create the instance of the <code>KeyStore</code>, I don't pass the provider. What happens if you remove <code>providerPKCS11</code>? It should find the provider as you're adding it to the <code>Security</code> instance.</p>

<p>In your config file, you chose the name <code>eToken5100_20130805</code> and that's fine. You can use any name you want. This answers your question 2.</p>

<p>As for your question 3, there's an example on how to find the slot you need in section 4.1.2 if the book you refer to (and if which I'm the author), but if you need a more simple example, please read the answers to this question on StackOverflow: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8247115/java-keytool-with-opensc-pkcs11-provider-only-works-with-debug-option-enabled"">java keytool with opensc pkcs#11 provider only works with debug option enabled</a></p>

<p>Note that you have established that the provider works. Your config file is read correctly, otherwise you wouldn't see the name you chose in the exception (SunPKCS11-eToken5100_20130805). The problem is that you can't load the keystore. I've found <a href=""https://jira.primekey.se/browse/ECA-3453"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this post</a> about this problem. I'm not sure if it helps.</p>

<p>In any case: your attempt (A) can never work because <code>keytool</code> is unaware of the config file and thus unaware of the name you chose. Your attempt (C) fails because of a conflict between tools on Linux. I don't know the <code>modutil</code> tool you mention in (B), but if I see the output, I would assume that the library to access the token is loaded correctly, and that there are 6 USB slots in the server, but that there is no USB token in any of these slots. Maybe it's as simple as that: maybe your USB token isn't inserted in an USB slot of your server, or maybe it is inserted, but it isn't seen because of a hardware driver problem.</p>

<p>I would check with the hosting company first.</p>

","<p>Well, it is of course possible to pass the hash to the client and sign it there, but the devil is in details -- in case of such distributed signing you need to design a really secure way to pass the hash and the signature and to sign it securely on the client side. Also you need to have the code on the server that will let you calculate the hash, pass it to the client and then embed the signature to the signing format of your choice. </p>

","<p>@Eugene brings up some valid points about the details of securely passing the hash.</p>

<p>Since you have an eToken, you could use it to establish a 2-way SSL session between the client and server.  This session could be used to transfer the hash to the client, and the resulting signature back to the server.</p>

<p>For signing a hash on the client side in Java, you could use a <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/security/Signature.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Signature</a> algorithm like <code>NONEwithRSA</code> instead of one like <code>SHA256withRSA</code>.</p>

<p>""NONE"" specifies that the raw data (in this case the hash) will be signed and not hashed again by the algorithm.</p>

","<p>A first tentative analysis results in the observations that</p>

<ol>
<li>the signature is correctly embedded,</li>
<li>the <code>messageDigest</code> signed attribute contains the correct hash of the signed byte ranges of the PDF, but</li>
<li><em>the signature bytes do not constitute a signature of the signed attributes with the private key associated with the given certificate</em>.</li>

","<p>IMO there is nothing you can do about it but contact the producer of <code>libacospkcs11.so</code> and ask for an explanation. You will most likely be directed to the documentation which will state that symmetric keys can be created only as a session objects and all operations with such keys are performed in SW (not in the card) - this is rather a common practice with most of the commercially available cards and middleware suites.</p>

<p>BTW you can also try to call <code>C_GetMechanismInfo</code> for <code>CKM_AES_KEY_GEN</code> mechanism (and also other AES mechanisms you are planning to use) and check whether the <code>CKF_HW</code> flag is set in the response. This flag indicates whether the mechanism is performed by the device or in the software.</p>

","<p>Perhaps you have a special circumstance where you want to use HSM keys to sign documents. Most of the time, document signing is done with 'person-entity' PKI certificates. In this scenario, your local Certificate Authority (Windows Server), has been configured to store the CA's private key on the SafeNet HSM. Then the local CA would issue personal PKI certificates to users of that domain (Bob Smith). Then a user, Bob, could use his certificate that is local to his machine to sign documents. This would provide integrity and nonrepudiation, and the certificate would signed by that individual.</p>

<p>In your implementation, any signed document would simply display the subject name of the HSM certificate, which in most implementations would be a domain's CA name, etc.</p>

<p>As can be seen, this is NOT a very elegant way of programming as file is read and written as many times as number of pages. Is there any other way of inserting digital signature on every page of PDF document.</p>

<p>What is actually wanted to do here is that - in case the PDF document is split into pages (in future), since the contents haven't changed, so technically digital signature should be valid for the pages it is signed. But I realize the signature will get invalidated. (Rephrasing the question - Is there any way of digitally signing only one page of pdf and not entire document?)</p>

<p>To Bruno Lowagie (you are expert) : Except that it is not provided in PDF specification, it is possible to partially sign a PDF file by signing the hash computed only on selected components. Do you think it is possible to upgrade PDF specifications to accommodate such requirement. Thank you for your help.</p>
","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This train of thought is based on a misconception. Yes, you have the visualization of the signature on one specific page, but cryptographically the signature signs the whole PDF with the sole exception of the embedded CMS signature container itself.</p>

<p>But you found out about this yourself. Thus, let's consider your rephrased question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But I realize the signature will get invalidated. (Rephrasing the question - <strong>Is there any way of digitally signing only one page of pdf and not entire document?</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the past there had been two ways which <em>might</em> have allowed to sign single pages:</p>

<ul>
<li>using an <em>object digest</em> focusing on the page in question;</li>
<li>using a <em>byte range digest</em> only consisting of byte ranges covering objects related to the page in question.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nowadays, though, these techniques are not usable options anymore because</p>

<ul>
<li><em>object digests</em> have been deprecated a long time ago, the ISO PDF specification does not even mention them anymore;</li>
<li>even though ISO 32000-1 still allows <em>byte range digests</em> to cover such a collection of fragments of the PDF, PDF processors (in particular Adobe Reader) require the byte ranges to cover the whole PDF file with the sole exception of the embedded signature container; newer specifications (e.g. the ETSI PAdES specifications and the ISO 32000-2 drafts) also require this.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, no, there is no way of digitally signing only one page of pdf and not entire document, at least not in an interoperable manner.</p>

<hr>

<p>An option for achieving something similar as page-wise signatures in a multi-page PDF would be to</p>

<ul>
<li>split the PDF into multiple PDFs, each containing a single page only;</li>
<li>signing each of these single page PDFs; and</li>
<li>putting all these single-page PDFs into a PDF portable collection (aka portfolio) and arranging it to display the individual contained PDFs one after the other in the correct order.</li>

</ul>

<p>Last but not least, if your software makes use of PKCS#11 then as long as you have a PKCS#11 provider for your card (there are several CAC modules and ""generic"" vendor cards usually come with one as well) you don't need to care about the actual card, because PKCS#11 abstracts the details away.</p>

","<p>I don't have enough points to comment, but I wanted to agree with @Jay.  You probably need to configure this third-party library to trust the DoD root certs, so that when a CAC user presents his client cert, your app can trust it.</p>

<p>The DoD root certs are publicly available:
<a href=""http://dodpki.c3pki.chamb.disa.mil/rootca.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dodpki.c3pki.chamb.disa.mil/rootca.html</a></p>

<p>Also if the behavior you are observing is that the client isn't even getting prompted to choose a client cert, or you are not observing a client cert being sent in the packet trace, then this may also be because your server does not trust the DoD CA.  When when a well behaved server requests a client cert, it also advertises the distinguished names(dn) of the CA's that it trusts.  A well behaved client will then inspect that list, and compare those names the the issuers of the cleint certs that it has available.  If there is no match then the client will send a ""null"" cert.  I know IIS/Apache and Firefox/IE/Chrome behave this way.  Opera, however, does not seem to discriminate based on the advertised issuers, and will send any cert that client has lying around.</p>

","<p>I found library which solved my problem. It's <a href=""https://github.com/esig/dss"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/esig/dss</a>. I used JavaSE11(jdk-11.0.2), pkcs11.dll placed in C:/Windows/System32 directory.

"8218566","Java Sun PKCS#11 provider, HSM token LOGIN REQUIRED flag not set and empty list of aliases","<p>I'm Pavel and I'm mainly a Java developer. Here is my problem:</p>

<p>I'm trying to list aliases in HSM slot using Java Sun PKCS#11 provider and I'm getting an empty list. I have tried it with Java 6 and 7 on Windows XP/Server platforms.
I downloaded Sun PKCS#11 sources and examined them, switched on debugging, did other tricks so finally I discovered that the aliases map is empty because the token has LOGIN_REQUIRED flag not set. In Sun PKCS#11 implementation there is one IF construct so when this flag is not set even the PIN bytes are provided to the keystore there is no C_Login call!
I find it is strange! Can someone explain me if it is a bug in Sun implementation of PKCS#11 provider or there is a general idea behind it?
Anyway when I ""hack"" the original sources so if there is a PIN provided It makes a login op to token no matter if the LOGIN_REQUIRED flag is set or not and I got the aliases from the token!</p>
","<p>That's correct, the Sun PKCS#11 provider tries to look for all the private keys that are visible publicly (without logging in) when finding aliases. After that, it will try and find a viable certificate chain for the private keys (first by PKCS#11 ID, then by X509 issuer).</p>

<p>I haven't got a clue why, but it seems to me that the PKCS#11 provider came to live at the same time that the Sparc T1 processor (Niagara) was introduced, which contains a cryptographic processor. There has never been any compatability data provided by Sun/Oracle - I presume their main focus was getting the T1 working within Java - this is however a guess. The only way to know for sure it to ask.</p>

<p>If you want to have a better provider, you can take a look at the IAIK software (whose lower level, open source, implementation is used by Sun/Oracle). They do provide support and compatability statements. This is, however, a commercial product.</p>

<p>Or you can get your patch accepted, I would certainly be interested in an <em>option</em> to login before the available private keys are looked up using PKCS#11 FindObjects. If you file a bug report I will certainly vote for it.</p>

"9430343","RSA - Encryption with negative exponent","<p>Well guys I am trying to encrypt (actually sign) data using Public and Private exponent and modulus, It is in C#.NET and I can't use <code>RSACryptoServiceProvider</code> because it needs also both prime numbers and other CRT stuff.</p>

<p>So I am trying to do following:</p>

<pre><code>private Byte[] signData()
{
  BigInteger biPrivEx = new BigInteger(this.privEx); // Those are byte[]
  BigInteger biPubEx = new BigInteger(this.pubEx);
  BigInteger biMod = new BigInteger(this.mod);          

  BigInteger cyph = BigInteger.ModPow(new BigInteger(pkcs11), biPrivEx, biMod); // This raise exception

  return cyph.ToByteArray();;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But the problem is I am getting <code>Out Of Range Exception</code> because my private exponent is negative number.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? Or is possible to easily recovery CRT from this? Or maybe is there any better way how to do it?
In different program I am able to this with data I am using, so I have got reference to verify it.</p>
","<p>The problem is that you got a negative private exponent in the first place. Depending on how you got this broken exponent try:</p>

<ol>
<li>Adding <code>n</code> to it</li>
<li>Concating a <code>00</code> byte to the array, to make it parse correctly.</li>
</ol>

<p>You should also be careful about endianness issues. .net's <code>BigInteger</code> uses little endian, other binary formats might use big endian.</p>

<hr>

<p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>BigInteger ParseBinaryLE(byte[] raw)
{
   return new BigInteger(raw.Concat(new byte[]{0}).ToArray());
}

BigInteger ParseBinaryBE(byte[] raw)
{
   return new BigInteger(raw.Reverse().Concat(new byte[]{0}).ToArray());
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>AFAIK it is also possible to recover <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code> (and from those the rest of the parameters) when you know <code>e</code>, <code>d</code> and <code>n</code>.</p>

<p>I don't know if it's relevant, but when testing my server site in www.ssllabs.com, I found TLSv1.2 is supported but TLSv1.1 is not. And the algorithm which is picked here in the log is not listed in the preferred list of the server:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/q3iby.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/q3iby.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So, what can be the reason?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I have changed the <code>$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security</code>, disabling the <code>TLSv1.2</code> and <code>SSLv3</code> in the option <code>jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, TLSv1.1</code>, leaving only <code>TLSv1.1</code> because it's the server's choice, to no avail.</p></li>
<li><p>The driver I used to load the Provider is from Izenpe website. From what I got in the Console of Eclipse, it's working.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>My thought about it:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>What fails maybe the Provider <code>SunPKCS11</code>. I say this because the original code works in Windows when we use <code>SunMSCAPI</code>. Some internal mechanism of <code>SunMSCAPI</code> did the work for us to sign the challenge. But now as we must adapt the project to be multi-platformed, in Linux we have no choice but <code>SunPKCS11</code>. The JAR <code>sunpkcs11.jar</code> of Java 6 and Java 8 both failed. (In Java 7 it's not present.)</p></li>
<li><p>The original intention is to make (almost) all smart cards available for authentication in my APP, but at the moment we only want Izenpe and DNIe(Spanish electronic ID card, supported by OpenSC) to work. </p></li>
</ul>

<hr>
","<p>while I'm not too versed in PKCS#11 (nor in SSL when I think about it) from your description and log files the following items caught my attention and have me thinking:</p>

<p>Considering the InvalidKeyException thrown above and the highlighted algorithm (TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA), I'm inclined to believe that the key is an elliptic curve key, not RSA (in the screenshot, it states that security provided by TLS_ECDHE equals the one you get by using RSA with 2048 bits). 
Consequentially, somewhere along the way the wrong Signature Provider (RSA instead of ECDSA) is selected, either programmatically or by a malformed certificate.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>I don't know if it's relevant, but when testing my server site in www.ssllabs.com, I found TLSv1.2 is supported but TLSv1.1 is not. And the algorithm which is picked here in the log is not listed in the preferred list of the server:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/q3iby.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/q3iby.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So, what can be the reason?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I have changed the <code>$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security</code>, disabling the <code>TLSv1.2</code> and <code>SSLv3</code> in the option <code>jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, TLSv1.1</code>, leaving only <code>TLSv1.1</code> because it's the server's choice, to no avail.</p></li>
<li><p>The driver I used to load the Provider is from Izenpe website. From what I got in the Console of Eclipse, it's working.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>My thought about it:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>What fails maybe the Provider <code>SunPKCS11</code>. I say this because the original code works in Windows when we use <code>SunMSCAPI</code>. Some internal mechanism of <code>SunMSCAPI</code> did the work for us to sign the challenge. But now as we must adapt the project to be multi-platformed, in Linux we have no choice but <code>SunPKCS11</code>. The JAR <code>sunpkcs11.jar</code> of Java 6 and Java 8 both failed. (In Java 7 it's not present.)</p></li>
<li><p>The original intention is to make (almost) all smart cards available for authentication in my APP, but at the moment we only want Izenpe and DNIe(Spanish electronic ID card, supported by OpenSC) to work. </p></li>
</ul>

<hr>
","<p>Looks like for the SSL connection by the Java JCE, Entrust Provider is being used.</p>

","<p>CKR_HOST_MEMORY error is most likely returned by the PKCS#11 library your JRE is using as a ""plugin"" which performs cryptographic operations (digital signature creation in your case). PKCS#11 libraries are usually provided by the vendors of specialized cryptographic hardware such as smartcards or HSMs and these libraries provide standardized API which can be used by other applications to access such devices in an easy and convenient way.</p>

<p>When you look at <a href=""http://pkcs11interop.net/rsa-pkcs11-2.20/pkcs-11v2-20.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">PKCS#11 v2.20 specification</a> you will find this description of the error you are getting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CKR_HOST_MEMORY: The computer that  the Cryptoki library is running on
  has  insufficient memory to perform the requested function.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe you should contact the vendor of the PKCS#11 library you are using. He should be able to diagnose and resolve your problem.</p>

<p>I have encountered the same problem. But when I list all mechanisms supported by OpenSC, I can see the minimum keysize for RSA_PKCS is <code>512</code>. Actually, this is the <strong>modulus size</strong>. The corresponding <strong>key size is <code>4096</code></strong> . So just make sure your key pair generated is at least <code>4096</code> bits long.
In my case, it worked (using the <code>pkcs11-tool</code> command. I haven't yet implemented the <code>C</code> code fr that).</p>

","<p>The modules are used as middleware to the actual device like smart cards, USB tokens and hardware security modules (HSMs) or even software emulations for PKCS#11.</p>

<p>You can think of it as a hardware driver mapping PKCS#11 to the concrete device, with some modules offering vendor-specific algorithms, login mechanisms etc. </p>

<p>Some known modules are listed here:
<a href=""http://wiki.ncryptoki.com/Known-PKCS-11-modules.ashx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.ncryptoki.com/Known-PKCS-11-modules.ashx</a></p>

<p>Using OpenSC, you already have support for a lot of different devices:</p>

<p>Same result crash with c0000005</p>
","<p>OpenSC PKCS#11 library sees your token as ""uninitialized"". If I remember correctly ePass token initialized with Feitian middleware cannot be used with OpenSC, and vice versa. So if you want to use ePass with <code>opensc-pkcs11.dll</code> then you will need to use <code>pkcs15-init.exe</code> application shipped with OpenSC to initialize your token.</p>

<p><strong>Documentation references:</strong></p>

<p>OpenSC wiki mentions requirement for reinitialization on <a href=""https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/Feitian-ePass3000"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ePass3000 page</a> but not on <a href=""https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/Feitian-ePass2003"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ePass2003 page</a>. European distributor <a href=""http://www.gooze.eu/hu/howto/smartcard-quickstarter-guide/pkcs15-binding-failed-unsupported-card-fixed"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gooze.eu</a> also states that reinitialization is required:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason is that the ePass2003 is pre-initialized to be recognised
  under Windows7 by Feitian priprietary software. To be usable, the
  ePass2003 need to be initialized by OpenSC.</p>

<p><strong>Practical examples:</strong></p>

<p>I have initialized my ePass2003 token with Feitian middleware and tested with proprietary <code>eps2003csp11.dll</code> library - it was working fine:</p>

"31188663","Disabling PKCS11 solaris implementation","<p>I am performance testing an application which performs poorly when SunPKCS11-Solaris is enabled. The app is deployed in WebLogic which runs on Solaris. I have found that disabling SunPKCS11 by <strong>sun.security.pkcs11.enable-solaris=false</strong> fixed our problem but I am not sure what the other impacts of that switch are. Does anybody know what <strong>sun.security.pkcs11.enable-solaris</strong> switch does? </p>

<p>The other thing that puzzles me is we do use PKCS11 in our certificates but they work fine after disabling SunPKCS-Solaris with the switch above, so I am wondering if there are other providers available to the VM.</p>
","<p>Farzad -</p>

<p>Java can use any number of providers to accomplish the same task, and is highly configurable. You can disable entire providers or just certain algorithms in that provider.  I believe they are listed in the configuration file in preference order.</p>

<p>Depending on what tasks you're trying to do, the ucrypto provider on Solaris should be faster (but it is not as complete as the PKCS#11 provider, so may not have the algorithms, etc, that you need).</p>

<p>Depending on which JDK, OS and hardware platform you're on, the PKCS#11 provider may be faster than JavaNative. In other cases, JavaNative will be faster.  Please note that Java's configuration file has to work across multiple Solaris OS versions, for example, Solaris 10u11, Solaris 11.2 and Solaris 11.3, and on multiple hardware platforms that vary in crypto capabilities. As it is a generic file, it is not always perfectly tuned for your specific scenario.</p>

<p>If you are trying to utilize a hardware keystore installed on Solaris, like nCipher or SCA6000, you would likely need to go through PKCS#11.</p>

<p>Hope that helps,</p>

"25536592","iText: how to locate/obtain Linux shared-library to implement PDF Digital signatures with USB Token?","<p>I'm trying to follow the instructions documented on page 96 of the (excellent) book ""<a href=""http://itextpdf.com/book/digitalsignatures20130304.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Digital Signatures in PDF Documents</a>"" section 4.1.2 titled ""Signing a document using a USB token (part 2: PKCS#11)"".</p>

<p>Specifically, Code Sample 4.2 starts with the following line:</p>

<pre><code>public static final String DLL = ""c:/windows/system32/dkck201.dll"";
</code></pre>

<p>This code example is for a Windows machine. If I'm using Linux (CentOS 64 bit) with a USB Token (such as the example's iKey 4000), what file would I use and where does it come from (e.g. the token manufacturer, the PDF Digital Certificate provider, the CentOS operating system, Java, etc...)?</p>

<p>The text states: <code>Make you have the correct path to the CRYPTOKI (PKCS#11) DLL. If you want to make this work on Linux, you’ll need a path to a .so-file such as libCryptoki2_64.so, libpkcs11.so…</code> </p>

<p>I don't know much about this topic. I searched but those two <code>.so</code> files listed above for Linux do not appear to be on my machine. However, the following files ARE on the machine -- but I'm not sure if one might be a suitable substitute:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/lib64/pkcs11
/usr/lib64/libCrypto.so
/usr/lib64/libeTPkcs11.so
~/jre/lib/amd64/libj2pkcs11.so
~/jre/lib/ext/sunpkcs11.jar
</code></pre>

<p>Can someone advise me how to obtain (or locate) an <code>.so</code> file that could be used with a USB Token on Linux 64b? Or at least describe in general terms what this file is, where is comes from, etc.?</p>

<p>Any help much appreciated!</p>

<p>I am not into python, so please take it as a proof of concept and not as a solution. For the interesting parts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>as your PKCS#11 driver does not support RSA signature with a hash it is needed to calculate the hash and build the <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2313#section-10.1.2"" rel=""nofollow"">DigestInfo ASN.1 part</a> manually (the result is in the <code>binaryData2</code> variable)</p></li>
<li><p>as <code>RSA.new_pub_key()</code> accepts a tuple in openssl's format for <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/crypto/BN_bn2bin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">BN_mpi2bn</a> (which it uses internally), it was needed to prefix the modulus with one additional <code>\x00</code> to ensure it is interpreted as a positive number (the <code>'\x00\x00\x01\x01\x00'</code> part)</p></li>
<li><p>given the function <code>verify()</code> uses openssl's <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/crypto/RSA_sign.html"" rel=""nofollow"">RSA_verify</a> which takes as an argument a digest of signed data (and not the data itself) it was needed to obey and give it the digest (which is re-used from the signature generation part and you would have to generate a fresh one if you plan to have a separate verify function)</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Note: For e.g. SHA256, you would need to use the appropriate digestInfo magic ASN.1 string prefix (see <a href=""https://hackage.haskell.org/package/crypto-pubkey-0.2.8/docs/src/Crypto-PubKey-HashDescr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> for usable values) + appropriate digest object from the hashlib + correct 3rd verify call argument.</p>

Using dependency walker I managed to get a list of functions that dll library holds, and that list sums up to <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd627645%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Microsoft Smart Card Api</a> functions. I was wondering if there is some native wrapper that enables me to call that functions from Java? </p>

<p>Regarding the nature of smart card, it should contain cryptography functions (PKCS#11), but I wasn't able to instantiate a sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11 provider because of this error:</p>

<pre><code>Caused by: java.io.IOException: The specified procedure could not be found.
     at sun.security.pkcs11.wrapper.PKCS11.connect(Native Method)
</code></pre>

<p>Any guideline will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</p>

<p>For anyone having this problem as well, it turns out that my smart card doesn't support PKCS11 and I don't have appropriate PKCS11 dll.</p>
","<p>Well, I recently worked in a project which used to have Smart Card access for PKI Certificates and there we had the help from these two frameworks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Legion of BouncyCastle Java API (for PKI method abstractions) <a href=""http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html</a></p></li>
<li><p>IAIK JCE PKCS11 Wrapper (for generic .dll smart card access) <a href=""http://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/sic/Products/Core-Crypto-Toolkits/PKCS_11_Wrapper"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/sic/Products/Core-Crypto-Toolkits/PKCS_11_Wrapper</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think that the second option shall be something that might help you too.</p>

"33820636","Java applet to implement Digital signature using smart card","<p>How to sign a post(any document or text) in browser using smart card. 
What I have investigated so far:</p>

<p>ActiveX - IE only
<strong>Silverlight</strong> - no access to certificates at all and as a plugin faces the same limitations as Java</p>

<p><strong>Browser specific extensions</strong>; For example Firefox up until version 33 used to have window.crypto.signText but not anymore</p>

<p><strong>local applications installed on the client</strong> - not easy to install, support, develop and update for several OS and their different versions.</p>

<p><strong>Web Cryptography</strong> - ""only basic cryptographic functions"", no certificates support

<p>The <a href=""https://www.cryptsoft.com/pkcs11doc/STANDARD/pkcs-11v2-20.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">PKCS#11 documentation</a> doesn't seem to contain any information about it.</p>
","<p>I see two ways to do this; the appropriate one depends on the token (not all tokens/wrappers do all machanisms).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>As explained in this <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/47106123/903600"">other answer</a>, you could decorate the 32-octet SHA-256 that you start from into a full padded message representative. Basically, as explained in <a href=""https://www.cryptsoft.com/pkcs11doc/STANDARD/pkcs-11v2-20.pdf#page=40"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PKCS#1</a>, if the RSA key is <em>k</em> octets (with I assume <em>k</em>&ge;51+11=62 octets, that is a public modulus at least 8⋅62-7=489 bits, which is a must for security), you</p>

<ol>
<li>Append on the left the 19-octet string

<pre>30 31 30 0d 06 09 60 86 48 01 65 03 04 02 01 05 00 04 20</pre>

yielding a 51-octet string, which really is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ASN.1</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690#DER_encoding"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DER</a> encoding for the hash type and value per

<pre>
DigestInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
    digestAlgorithm DigestAlgorithm,
    digest OCTET STRING
}
</pre></li>
<li>Further append on the left the string of <em>k</em>-51 octets (of which <em>k</em>-51-3 are <code>FF</code>)

<pre>00 01 FF FF FF FF..FF FF FF FF 00</pre>

yielding a <em>k</em>-octet string</li>
<li>Sign with mechanism <strong>CKM_RSA_X_509</strong> (length <em>k</em> octets).</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Or, alternatively: perform as in [1.]; skip [2.]; and in [3.] use mechanism <strong>CKM_RSA_PKCS</strong> (length 51 octets).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Disclaimer: I did not check, and have not used a PKCS#11 device lately.</p>

<p>Note: While there is no known attack against proper implementations of it, use of PKCS#1 v1.5 signature padding is increasingly frowned at; e.g. <a href=""https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2014/11/RGS_v-2-0_B1.pdf#page=22"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">French authorities recommend</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RecomSignAsym-1. &nbsp;  Il est recommandé d’employer des mécanismes de signature asymétrique disposant d’une preuve de sécurité.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, in English:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is recommended to use asymmetric signature mechanisms featuring a security proof</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They mention RSA-SSA-PSS (<em>sic</em>). As a bonus, the PKCS#11 implementation of that is mechanism <strong>CKM_RSA_PKCS_PSS</strong> which accepts a hash, rather than the data to sign, making what's asked trivial.</p>

","<p><strong>SOLVED</strong></p>

<p>Okay, I found a solution for my problem.</p>

<p>It turned out that the provider was trying to use card's slot with id 0 by default. Card, at which there was problem, have non qualified certificates on three first slots. Tokens on these slots isn't initialized. The qualified cert I was trying to use is placed on fourth slot. </p>

<p>I used <code>IAIK PKCS11 Wrapper</code> to get info about <code>Tokens</code> of this card. Here's code sample:</p>

<pre><code>        try {
            Module module = Module.getInstance(value);
            module.initialize(null);
            Slot[] slots = module.getSlotList(true);
            TokenInfo[] infos = new TokenInfo[slots.length];
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; slots.length; i++) {
                infos[i] = slots[i].getToken().getTokenInfo();
            }
            printTokenInfos(infos);
            if (slots.length == 0) {
                System.err.println(""No token available!"");
                return;
            }
        } catch (TokenException | IOException e1) {
            e1.printStackTrace();
        }

        [...]

    private void printTokenInfos(TokenInfo[] infos) {
        int counter = 0;
        for (TokenInfo info : infos) {
            System.out.println(""Token: "" + counter++);
            System.out.println(info);
        }
    }

    //""value"" passed to Module's getInstance method is th path for .dll module 
    //used for one's type of card.
</code></pre>

<p>From this place I can determine which slot I should use. It can be accomplished by adding <code>slotListIndex</code> parameter to Provider's configuration input stream. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>    String pkcs11config = ""name = "" + PROVIDER + ""\nlibrary = \"""" + value + ""\""\nslotListIndex = "" + slotIndex;

In Java JCE, it is typically the default choice for RSA.</p>

I can successfully obtain the keystore from the smart card, containing user's certificate and a non-exportable private key (it's a regular PrivateKey object, but the ""getEncoded"" method returns null).</p>

<p>This site: <a href=""https://pst.giustizia.it/PST/authentication/it/pst_ar.wp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://pst.giustizia.it/PST/authentication/it/pst_ar.wp</a>
has a login link which changes everytime you visit. So, as a user would do, I do the same in my Java app: I visit the page once to obtain that link, and then I perform the SSL Authentication on that link (Kinda like simulating visiting the page and clicking on that link).</p>

<p>This is the code I use:</p>

<pre><code>public class SSLAuth

    private static String LOGIN_PAGE = ""https://pst.giustizia.it/PST/authentication/it/pst_ar.wp"";

<p>I need only to authenticate the first time, because once logged in, the website checks only a cookie named ""JSESSIONID"" and client's User Agent string. I have already tested this. Once you have these two valid parameters, you can visit the page even from another browser.</p>

<p>Anyway, the ""loadKeyStorePKCS11"" method gives you the keystore mentioned above, which contains the certification chain (99%, maybe 100% are only one certificate, because I tried 26 different smart cards, and they have only one certificate: the user's one), and a non-exportable private key.
I tried to look around the internet for solutions, but they are all about PKCS#12, which I don't need this.</p>

<p>I tried using different protocols (SSL and TLS) and different versions of it, but nothing!</p>

<p>Firefox can do smart card authentication, and I know for sure I'm missing something in the procedure! When I call the ""execute"" method on ""httpClient"" object, it gives me an exception: ""handshake_failure"" (SSLHandshakeException).</p>

<p>If I use ""loadKeyMaterial"" instead of ""loadTrustMaterial"", I get ""unsupported_certificate"".</p>

<p>I don't really know what I have to do at this point!
Do you have any advice?
Thanks in advance!</p>
","<p>Thanks for posting the log, I'll make this an answer since it's too much for a comment.</p>

<p>Short answer: the server is asking for a client certificate and you don't have one or are not configured to provide one that's acceptable.</p>

<p>Search in your log for this:</p>

<pre><code>main, READ: TLSv1 Handshake, length = 11296
*** CertificateRequest
Cert Types: RSA, DSS
Cert Authorities:
</code></pre>

<p>This is the server asking you for a client certificate. What follows is a list of acceptable CAs. You must have a certificate in your keystore issued by one of those CAs and client certificates must be enabled for the session on the client side.</p>

<p>The next part of the log then says this:</p>

<pre><code>*** ServerHelloDone
Warning: no suitable certificate found - continuing without client 
authentication
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately it seems you don't have a certificate acceptable to the server, or are not configured for client certificate mode and that's why it cuts you off and aborts the handshake.</p>

","<p>It depends :) What platform(s) are you targeting? On Jelly Bean, there is some support for hardware devices in the keystore, so you can write a keymaster module that uses your PKCS#11. That, however is a OS component, so it would require implementing your own ROM. You can also develop your own JCE provider that is backed by the PKCS#11 module. Then, in your browser, make sure the SSL engine uses your provider when doing client auth. </p>

I can use both, but right now I'm using the CryptoAPI one for having an easier support for all keyboards/Windows versions:</p>

<pre><code>keystore = KeyStore.getInstance(""Windows-MY"");
keystore.load(null,null);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using Javascript to comunicate with Java to sign some operations in a web application I am developing.</p>

<p>The default use case is just what I need:</p>

<ul>
<li>I get/load the Keystore</li>
<li>I try to sign something, it ask for the PIN and once introduced it remembers until the end of the session (when I extract the SmartCard or cache timeout).</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is: It's an embedded Applet. When I sign something in web page A and then I go to web page B (through a link or redirect, for ex.), the Applet is destroyed/created (just like the JVM) and the session is lost so I have to introduce again the PIN. This does not happen if I do not leave/reload the actual web page, of course.</p>

<p>Questions: Is there some way to reuse the session/Applet/JVM programmatically? or loading the Keystore in a way that can avoid this problem?</p>

<p>Possible workaround solutions I already know:</p>

<ul>
<li>Free floating Applet. I can't, it has no GUI and I need to comunicate with JS...</li>
<li>Web in a frameset/iframe. Dirty.</li>
<li>Ajaxify the web (just one page + all operations in Ajax + some kind of history JS plugin or PushState). This is the solution I like more but requires some refactoring.</li>
</ul>
","<p>I ended up doing it in a completely different way: Creating a client desktop app for the signature. This app is installed in all desktop clients (this is ok for me because it's a corporate environment).
This new app listens to a port with a <code>HttpListener</code>. I connect from the web via javascript (jsonp), send the string to be signed, and it returns the js callback with the result signed.</p>

<ul>
<li>It now remembers the PIN because it does not lose the session.</li>

After a bit of researching, I discovered NCryptoki and I believe that will provide the necessary interface between my program and a compliant token.  </p>

<p>I've got a couple of questions that I can't seem to find answers for that I hope the experienced people here can help me with.  I'm still new with PKCS#11 and cryptography principles in general so some of these questions may seem a little juvenile.</p>

<ol>
<li>My theory is that the token will be able to be inserted into a computer and, using methods in my program that implemented the NCryptoki library, the encrypted files will be able to be saved directly onto it.  The files would only be able to be accessed through a wizard in my program.  I should be able to continue saving files on the drive as long as the token has space.  Is all of this correct?</li>
<li>I will need at least 64K memory on the token and the token must be a minimum of FIPS 140-2 Level 2, preferably level 3.  I've looked and have only come across the SafeNet iKey 4000.  I KNOW there must be more PKCS#11 compliant tokens that have at least 64K storage.  I've spent hours going through the FIPS 140-1/2 Validated Crypto Modules looking for USB Storage PKCS#11 tokens but haven't had much luck.  Does anyone know of any other companies that sell what I'm looking for?  This could be a USB device or even a Smart Card.  We want to be able to provide multiple options for the customer.</li>
<li>Has anyone had any experience with this sort of implementation before that could provide me with some ""lessons learned"" or things to be aware of?</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, if this isn't the correct place to put this, please let me know where to repost.  I appreciate all of the help!</p>
","<p>While PKCS#11 supports storing of application data on the devices, the devices themselves (I am talking about USB cryptotokens and smartcards now) are designed for a different purpose. In particular, they are designed to hold small pieces of secret or sensitive data. They are not a data storage. Some vendors provide hybrid tokens, where a USB cryptotoken is combined with a flash disk. But even in this situation these would be two devices in one case. </p>

<p>It is possible that your scenario can be modified in the following way so that you:</p>

<ol>
<li>generate a session key (possibly right on the device)</li>
<li>use this key to encrypt your sensitive data.</li>
<li>store the encrypted data elsewhere (on a USB disk part of the hybrid device, for example) and use the USB cryptotoken to encrypt/decrypt the data.</li>
</ol>

<p>On a side note: almost all cryptotoken devices require their drivers to be installed to the system. Unlike USB disks and flash cards there's no universal driver in the OS that would let you plug the USB cryptotoken and use it immediately without installing the driver. This is a hassle from user's perspective, so take this into account as well. </p>

"23818785","Looking to store encrypted files on PKCS#11 Compliant Hardware Token","<p>My C# .NET4 program has been storing data in encrypted files on the regular Windows file system and one of our customers has requested that we integrate the program with a PKCS#11 token (henceforth known as the 'token').  After a bit of researching, I discovered NCryptoki and I believe that will provide the necessary interface between my program and a compliant token.  </p>

<p>I've got a couple of questions that I can't seem to find answers for that I hope the experienced people here can help me with.  I'm still new with PKCS#11 and cryptography principles in general so some of these questions may seem a little juvenile.</p>

<ol>
<li>My theory is that the token will be able to be inserted into a computer and, using methods in my program that implemented the NCryptoki library, the encrypted files will be able to be saved directly onto it.  The files would only be able to be accessed through a wizard in my program.  I should be able to continue saving files on the drive as long as the token has space.  Is all of this correct?</li>
<li>I will need at least 64K memory on the token and the token must be a minimum of FIPS 140-2 Level 2, preferably level 3.  I've looked and have only come across the SafeNet iKey 4000.  I KNOW there must be more PKCS#11 compliant tokens that have at least 64K storage.  I've spent hours going through the FIPS 140-1/2 Validated Crypto Modules looking for USB Storage PKCS#11 tokens but haven't had much luck.  Does anyone know of any other companies that sell what I'm looking for?  This could be a USB device or even a Smart Card.  We want to be able to provide multiple options for the customer.</li>
<li>Has anyone had any experience with this sort of implementation before that could provide me with some ""lessons learned"" or things to be aware of?</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, if this isn't the correct place to put this, please let me know where to repost.  I appreciate all of the help!</p>
","<p>While NCryptoki is good and you will probably have no issues using it, I would recommend you to look at <a href=""http://pkcs11interop.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">PKCS11Interop</a>. It is fully unit tested and even the unit test are documented and serve as examples. It is a joy using it :) (Disclaimer: I am not the author of this library. I just happen to know the author and have been using this library a lot.)</p>

<ol>
<li>It could be possible. As a reference how to save data objects on smartcard please look at this <a href=""https://www.assembla.com/code/cryptostick/git-4/nodes/master/Pkcs11.cs"" rel=""nofollow"">keypass plugin</a>. </li>
<li>I have worked with Gemalto cards and Siemens cards but I don't know if they had FIPS 140-2 certification. When I searched for that keypas plugin I found <a href=""https://www.crypto-stick.com/en/introduction"" rel=""nofollow"">Cryptostick</a>. Doesn't say if it has Fips, but it has Common criteria 5 certification so it might be worth looking at.</li>
<li>Look at the keypass plugin I mentioned. It is implemented using PKCS11Interop I mentioned earlier.</li>

","<p>You should not have to set both of them, they are indeed separate. In fact, there exists in recent versions of the Gemalto SafeNet HSMs a partition policy that has to be enabled before so-called ""multi-purpose keys"" are even allowed.

"40026788","nCipher HSM retarget JCE key","<p>Is it possible to ""retarget"" keys generated via the ncipher JCE API to pkcs11? I know that you can retarget via the generatekey command but I don't see how to do it to an existing JCE key. The first prompt is for the ""source application"" and the <a href=""https://docops.ca.com/ca-apm/9-6/en/administrating/apm-security/using-ncipher-with-ca-cem/working-with-ncipher-keys-and-operator-cards#WorkingwithnCipherkeysandoperatorcards-Retargetingthewebserverprivatekey"" rel=""nofollow"">options don't seem to include JCE</a>. Does it support other options beyond the ones listed there or should I be looking at a different way of retargeting?</p>

<p>The ultimate goal here is to export a couple keys (asymmetric and symmetric) that were generated via nCipher's JCE API (yes, I know that an HSM's job is to secure the keys and exporting is usually not a good idea but it is a requirement here). We are able to export keys that were generated via the PKCS11 interface but not ones that were generated via the JCE so our thinking is that if we can retarget it from JCE to PKCS11 we might be able to export these keys as well. If there is another way to do this we are open to that as well.</p>

<p>Lastly, the JCE keys show up as ""recovery enabled"" when executing the nfkminfo on them. Does that mean that they are exportable or does recovery here mean something else?</p>
","<p>Disclaimer: I work for Thales e-Security but do not speak for the company.  </p>

<p>Yes you can retarget a jcecsp key to pkcs11.  If you have any jcecsp keys in your kmdata/local, /opt/nfast/bin/generatekey will offer jcecsp as a source option.  If you have no keys of that ilk, it will quietly omit that option from the source list.  <strong>However,</strong> this retarget process may not do what you think it does.  All retargeting does is change the application type and potentially the associated metadata: it doesn't change the fundamental capabilities of the key as those were baked into the protected key blob at generation time and cannot be changed. </p>

<p>The Security World uses nShield key ACLs to limit the key's capabilities (Sign, Verify, Encrypt, Decrypt, Wrap, Be Wrapped, etc.).  PKCS#11 pulls its parameters (CKA_SIGN, etc.) directly from the key ACLs, and when generating keys through the API, the ACLs saved in the key blob are derived directly from the parameters in the key template.  If you set CKA_SENSITIVE to FALSE, and your Security World allows it, you can generate and save an exportable key. JCE is not that sophisticated: it has no concept of key capabilities at all, so the Provider has to guess at the user's intent with the key and it defaults to a fairly generous set.  However, since as you point out the whole idea of HSMs is to protect key bits and not let you have them, Export is not one of the defaults.  And what's not baked into the key file when you create it, you don't get by retargeting the key.  </p>

<p>One thing you could do if you want to use JCE is to generate the key using a different Provider and then store it in an <em>nCipher.sworld</em> KeyStore using the nCipherKM Provider: this will import the key into the Security World (if your World allows that) and save it as a key_jcecsp_* file.  However this has nothing to do with key security so from an HSM perspective it's not recommended. Another thing you could do is to drop down to the native nCore API, generate the key with the ACL entries you require, and then polymorph it to a JCE Key Object and save it in the HSM-backed KeyStore.  You can shoot yourself in the foot as many times as you want with the ACLs on the key you create.  The polymorphing is very poorly documented: ask Thales Support and they can guide you.  </p>

<p>Finally, the Recovery capability means that in addition to the Working Key blob which may be protected by an Operator Card Set, the key file has a Recovery Blob.  This is in case that Operator Card Set is lost: the Recovery Blob can be opened up by the Administrator Card Set of the Security World using the rocs utility (Replace Operator Card Set), which will write a new key file under a new OCS.  No, this does not mean the key is exportable.  It just means that you are protected against losing the OCS.  Of course losing the ACS is a non-starter as that is your Root of Trust.</p>

"25360749","Encrypting data using smart card private key","<p>I am trying to use an applet in my web application to encrypt some data using a smart card. 
i am following this link:
<a href=""http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/3587361/Java-Applet-for-Signing-with-a-Smart-Card.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/3587361/Java-Applet-for-Signing-with-a-Smart-Card.htm</a></p>

<p>I am able to read the certificates stored in the smartcard and encrypt data using the certificates.
But it requires me to pass location of <strong>PKCS#11 implementation library file(.dll)</strong> and the smart card pin.</p>

<p>My functional requirement is to load the list of certificates from a single(or multiple) smart cards connected to a system without passing any .dll filepath. Ofcourse, when the user selects a certificate for signing he/she will enter the PIN. </p>

<p>Is it possible to extract certificate details from a smartcard without passing location of PKCS#11 implementation library file(.dll)</p>

<p>Implementation:</p>

<pre><code>PKCS11LibraryFileAndPINCodeDialog localPKCS11LibraryFileAndPINCodeDialog = new PKCS11LibraryFileAndPINCodeDialog();

boolean bool;

try {
  bool = localPKCS11LibraryFileAndPINCodeDialog.run();

}
finally
{
  localPKCS11LibraryFileAndPINCodeDialog.dispose();
}
if (bool)
{
  String str2 = this.mSignButton.getLabel();
  this.mSignButton.setLabel(""Working..."");
  this.mSignButton.setEnabled(false);
  try
  {
    String str3 = localPKCS11LibraryFileAndPINCodeDialog.getLibraryFileName();
    String str4 = localPKCS11LibraryFileAndPINCodeDialog.getSmartCardPINCode();
    SmartCardSignerApplet.CertificationChainAndSignatureBase64 localCertificationChainAndSignatureBase641 = signDocument(arrayOfByte, str3, str4);
  }

","<p>The short answer is ""No.""  When interacting with smart cards, Java simply passes the PKCS#11 requests on to the .dll file that actually interacts with the card, so you need to provide this .dll file to interact with the smart card and read certificates.  </p>

<p>You might be able to do this without the .dll file, but I think it would amount to rewriting the .dll code yourself.  My understanding is that different smart cards have different APIs, and the .dll files used to access them provide a standard PKCS#11 API, so rather than implement all smart card APIs, the Java libraries for smart card access just use the PKCS#11 interface provided by the .dll file.</p>

<p>Can anyone guide me on how to sign XML in this way...</p>
","<p>Signing is supported by the PKCS#11 provider that is delivered by Oracle. You may currently have a C style handle in the wrapper class, but that is not much use. The handle must be within a JCA provider to be used with the XML signing classes. And the provider must be signed by an Oracle provided code signing certificate.</p>

<p>To use the private key with the PKCS#11 provider, make sure that a certificate with the same ID is present in the PKCS#11 token. That way the combined private key/certificate entry will show up in the <code>""PKCS11""</code> <code>KeyStore</code>. You can use that to sign the XML data.</p>

","<p>It sounds like you're creating a PKI hardware device. I think your biggest hurdle will be accessing the ATMega32. It'll be up to you to implement an interface on the ATMega side, be that a RS232-usb bridge, USB Mass Storage, or proprietary with a custom driver. </p>

<p>A simple solution might be to use a USB Mass Storage interface to present a certificate as file on a pseudo disk.</p>

<p>Taking the custom driver route, Firefox (and other Mozilla products) use libraries that have interfaces for PKI hardware. See <a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">NSS</a> and <a href=""http://www.opensc-project.org/opensc/wiki/PKCS11"" rel=""nofollow"">OpenSC</a>.
At a guess it's possible that there's a PKI / PKCS11 driver API for Windows that you can implement. </p>

","<p>You can not ""add to Firefox"" but you can expose your data to firefox and make them available for use. To do this you need to <em>implement</em> PKCS#11 API and create so-called PKCS#11 driver (the user-mode DLL which implements those 70 or so functions defined in PKCS#11 API). Those functions would talk to the hardware device in order to perform certain operations. Then you plug this PKCS#11 DLL to Firefox and Firefox can use certificates on your device. </p>

<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42161179/how-to-use-pkcs11interop-with-an-nitrokey-hsm-to-derive-an-shared-secret-with-an"">Previosly question</a></p>

<p>For this, I want to use the <code>CKM_ECDH1_DERIVE</code> mechanisms. Which is supported by this HSM, see:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/geJgGzy.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>Referring to the <a href=""https://github.com/Pkcs11Interop/PKCS11-SPECS/raw/master/v2.20/pkcs-11v2-20.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PKCS#11 specification</a> this must be considered:</p>

<ol>
<li>The mechanism <code>CKM_ECDH1_DERIVE</code> must be used with the function <code>Derive</code> (Page 188)</li>
<li>The mechanism <code>CKM_ECDH1_DERIVE</code> expects parameter <code>CK_ECDH1_DERIVE_PARAMS</code> (Page 222) with this arguments:

<ol>
<li><strong>kdf</strong>: Key derivation function used on the shared secret value (CKD)</li>
<li><strong>sharedData</strong>: Some data shared between the two parties</li>
<li><strong>publicData</strong>: Other party's EC public key value</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The function <code>DeriveKey</code> expects these arguments:

<ol>
<li>Mechanism CKM.CKM_ECDH1_DERIVE</li>
<li>ObjectHandle PrivateKey</li>
<li>ObjectAttributes (Page 338)

<ol>
<li>CKA.CKA_CLASS -> CKO.CKO_SECRET_KEY</li>
<li>CKA.CKA_KEY_TYPE -> CKK.CKK_GENERIC_SECRET</li>
<li>But ""However, since these facts are all implicit in the mechanism, there is no need to specify any of them"" so these can be null?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>So with this information, I tried to implement a method.</p>

<p>But I get this Error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Net.Pkcs11Interop.Common.Pkcs11Exception : Method C_DeriveKey returned CKR_TEMPLATE_INCOMPLETE</p>
</blockquote>

<p>at <code>Session.DeriveKey</code>.</p>

<p>Explanation of <code>CKR_TEMPLATE_INCOMPLETE</code> (Page 64):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the attribute values in the supplied template, together with any default attribute
  values and any attribute values contributed to the object by the object-creation
  function itself, are insufficient to fully specify the object to create, then the attempt
  should fail with the error code CKR_TEMPLATE_INCOMPLETE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and here (Page 98)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CKR_TEMPLATE_INCOMPLETE: The template specified for creating an object is
  incomplete, and lacks some necessary attributes. See Section 10.1 for more
  information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I used the nesseary attributes:</p>

<ol>
<li>CKA.CKA_CLASS -> CKO.CKO_SECRET_KEY</li>
<li>CKA.CKA_KEY_TYPE -> CKK.CKK_GENERIC_SECRET</li>
</ol>

<p>Ideas?</p>

<h1>Update</h1>

<p>Now with updated List of ObjectAttributes (thx to the answer) I get the exception <code>Net.Pkcs11Interop.Common.Pkcs11Exception : Method C_DeriveKey returned CKR_DATA_LEN_RANGE</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CKR_DATA_LEN_RANGE: The plaintext input data to a cryptographic operation

  This return value has higher priority than CKR_DATA_INVALID.</p>

<p>For <code>CKA.CKA_VALUE_LEN</code> I tried different values with no success:</p>

<pre><code>CKA_VALUE_LEN

40 (320)
48 (384)
</code></pre>

<p>I stumble upon the public key, I not sure if I extract the public key the right way. Because it has a length of <code>664 Bit</code>.</p>

<p><code>CKA.CKA_VALUE</code> of <code>CKO.CKO_PUBLIC_KEY</code> (<code>664 Bit</code>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is the public key different between <code>pkcs15-tool</code> and <code>CKO.CKO_PUBLIC_KEY</code>?</li>
<li>Which format does <code>CkEcdh1DeriveParams</code> expect for <code>publicData</code>? </li>
<li>Do I extract the <code>publicData</code> the right way? Or what is the right way?</li>
<li>Must the value for <code>CKA.CKA_VALUE_LEN</code> equal to the lenght of my EC (<code>320 Bit</code>)?</li>
</ul>
","<p>That's a very nice and complete description of a problem.</p>

<p><code>CKR_TEMPLATE_INCOMPLETE</code> is always very painful to deal with because almost every library vendor expect different set of attributes to be provided and this error does not reveal which exact attributes are missing.</p>

<p>After a quick look at <a href=""https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/blob/2a68395d22b3623263cfa00b89a41760dff69281/src/tools/pkcs11-tool.c#L2959"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenSC source code</a> I would try with following template:</p>

<p>However I am not sure what is the correct value of <code>CKA_VALUE_LEN</code> attribute.</p>

I have tried <strong>IAIK</strong> but it couldn't connect with native library <strong>libeTPkcs11.so</strong> or <strong>eTPKCS11.dll</strong>. <strong>BouncyCastle</strong> doesn't work with <strong>PKCS11</strong>. Do you have any advices? Thank you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Code with SunPKCS11 (<strong><em>works but slow at .update(...)</em></strong>)</p>

<pre><code>String pkcs11config;
pkcs11config = ....
ByteArrayInputStream confStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(pkcs11config.getBytes());
SunPKCS11 provider = new SunPKCS11(confStream);
Security.addProvider(provider);
char[] password = ""...."".toCharArray();
String alias = ""..."";
PrivateKey privateKey = (PrivateKey) keystore.getKey(alias, password);
Signature signer = Signature.getInstance(""SHA256withRSA"", keystore.getProvider());
signer.initSign(privateKey);
String data = ""Hello world......"";
signer.update(data.getBytes());  // SLOW HERE! THE BIGGER THE DATA, THE SLOWER IT IS.
byte[] signedData = signer.sign();
</code></pre>

<p>Code tried with IAIK:</p>

<pre><code>String pwd = System.getProperty(""user.dir"");
String dllFile = pwd + ""/libeTPkcs11.so"";
Module m = Module.getInstance(dllFile);

","<p>Most of the professionals and stakeholders are facing a problem of increasing PDF file size at the time of filing MCA &amp; LLP form such as AOC-4, LLP Form 11 etc.  Mos of us have faced problem of increasing PDF file size after signing with Digital signature. In the case of LLP return filing, we may have to affix 4 DSC ie two partner, one designated partner and one professional DSC. each time when we affix Digital signature file size is getting increased which generally cross the size of the file prescribed by MCA for form upload.
Main reason for increasing the file size is the certificate revocation list(CRL) gets embedded with the signature each time when we affix signature.
To overcome above problem one has to follow below step</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Open any PDF file
  go to Edit -> Preferences- > Security
  click on Advanced Preferences, then select the ‘Creation’ tab.
  De-select ‘Include signature’s revocation status when signing</p>

<p>Can anyone please suggest me what the best pkcs11 install is ? I need to do the bare minimum stuff with it , nothing too fancy. </p>

<p>The instructions to download would be very helpful as well and if there are any code examples available that would be a great help. </p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>What is it you want to accomplish?</p>

<p>PKCS#11 is really just a standard API middleware exposes for accessing their capabilities. You can, for example, call into an HSM using the associated PKCS#11 library without opensc or other middleware.</p>

<p>Think of OpenSC as a set of tools for working with smart cards, one of the tools being a PKCS#11 library that can talk to numerous smart cards. For example, ones that implement the PIV card-edge/protocol.</p>

<p>On Linux, in general, you will probably need to use OpenSC to work with the most common cards as many rely on it for Linux support.</p>

<p>libengine, on the other hand, is a plug-in model for OpenSSL that allows you to load a PKCS#11 library in OpenSSL. This allows you to take an application designed for OpenSSL and get it to work with an HSM or smart card (in some cases).</p>

<p>It is turtles all the way down.</p>

"27129142","How to use private key on a PKCS#11 module instead of perivate key file for mutual-authentication in OpenSSL?","<p>I've a simple SSL client that uses OpenSSL library. My server requires client authentication &amp; so I've to set client's private key stored in a password protected PEM file. I use the following code for this purpose:</p>

<pre><code>/* set the private key from KeyFile */
if (SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file(ctx, KeyFile, SSL_FILETYPE_PEM) &lt;= 0)
{
    ERR_print_errors_fp(stderr);
    abort();
}

/* verify private key */
if ( !SSL_CTX_check_private_key(ctx) )
{
    fprintf(stderr, ""Private key does not match the public certificate\n"");
    abort();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to know how can I establish a SSL connection using private key stored on a security token (with PKCS#11 interface) instead of reading it from a file?</p>
","<p>Answer is a little bit complicated. 
First You need to load Engine of your PKCS#11:</p>

<pre><code>ENGINE_load_builtin_engines();
{
    if (!(e = ENGINE_by_id(""dynamic"")))
        goto err;
    if (!ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, ""SO_PATH"", ""dstu"", 0))
        goto err;
    if (!ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, ""LIST_ADD"", ""2"", 0))
        goto err;
    if (!ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, ""LOAD"", NULL, 0))
        goto err;
    e = ENGINE_by_id(""pkcs11_engine"");
    if (!e)
      return error;

res = ENGINE_init(e);
if (!ENGINE_set_default(e, ENGINE_METHOD_ALL))
    goto err;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>then you need load EVP_PKEY* from engine
<code>EVP_PKEY* key = ENGINE_load_private_key(e, ""SecureToken"", NULL, &amp;cb_data);</code></p>

<p>and pass it to SSL:
<code>int SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey(SSL_CTX *ctx, EVP_PKEY *pkey);</code></p>

<p>strings <code>SecureToken</code> and <code>pkcs11_engine</code> you should found in documentation to your engine pkcs11 module</p>

<p>Your card probably comes with a PKCS#11 module for at least Windows. PKCS#11 is just a software interface, much like a PAM module. What happens below the API is a different story.</p>

<p>Seriously though, it is not available in Android and there is not standard PKCS#11 support either (although JB does use a proprietary PKCS#11 provider for some things). Not sure if the code is in OpenJDK, but if it is, you can try to port it. However, since it is unlikely that you actually need to use the full PKCS#11 API, it will be much easier to write JNI wrappers only for the functions you need (sighing, verifying, hashing, etc.). </p>

","<p>The PKCS#11 provider of Sun is not really suitable for that. But it has been implemented on top of the open source wrapper from IAIK, which may contain what you are looking for, see the link to <a href=""http://javadoc.iaik.tugraz.at/pkcs11_wrapper/current/iaik/pkcs/pkcs11/Session.html#setPIN%28char%5b%5d,%20char%5b%5d%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Session.setPIN()</a>.

","<p>Using applet is no more supported by modern browsers. Thus you need to use Browser Extension which accesses Host service running below the browser to access Certificate Store on Local machine which has handle to private key on the usb cryptographic token or smart card using CSP (Crypto Service Provider on Windows). Thus signing of hash would be done inside the token and signed content (Signature) would be returned by host application to browser which in turn sends it to server to complete signing operation.</p>

"1863130","Sending Complete Chain from Common Access Card (CAC)?","<p>I'm attempting to enable SSL communication from a web service client (Axis2) using the certificate on the user's CAC card.  Works like a charm....UNTIL the web server is CAC enabled.  At that point the SSL connection is rejected with the error message that the other certificates in the chain were not included.</p>

<p>I have ensured that the provider is available, either by adding it to the security.properties file or creating it programatically.</p>

<p>My current approach is to simply set the system properties:
    System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.keyStore"", ""NONE"");
    System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType"", ""PKCS11"");</p>

<p>I understand from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/752890/how-to-connect-to-https-server-using-common-access-card/753129#753129"">this</a> question/answer that this approach only sends the ""end entity"" certificate.  Apparently I need to implement my own X509KeyManager.  This is new ground for me, can anyone suggest a good reference or provide samples of how to do so?</p>

<p>Appreciate the assistance.</p>
","<p>The best key manager implementation depends on the issuer of the certificates you expect to be using.</p>

<p>If the certificate on the user's CAC will <em>always</em> be issued by a specific CA, simply store that issuer's certificate and any intermediate certificates further up the chain in a PKCS&nbsp;#7 file. In the <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/X509KeyManager.html#getCertificateChain(java.lang.String)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>getCertificateChain()</code></a> method, this collection can be appended blindly to the user's certificate and returned.</p>

<p>If things aren't quite that simple, but a complete list of possible issuers can be enumerated, obtain all of their certificates, and <em>their</em> issuer's certificates, and so on, up to the root certificates.</p>

<p>Add all of the root certificates to a key store as trusted entries. Bundle the intermediate certificates in a PKCS-#7&ndash;format file.</p>

<p>Implement <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/X509KeyManager.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>X509KeyManager</code></a> (or extend <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/X509ExtendedKeyManager.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>X509ExtendedKeyManager</code></a> if you're working with <code>SSLEngine</code>).

<p>If you notice I am making use of two objects to apply locks. Object _syncLockPkcs11 is being used to implement singleton on m_Pkcs11 and _syncLockHSMLogin  is used to synchronize Login to HSM . Earlier when I did not have these locks in place, I used to get the following errors from HSM,  CKU_USER_ALREADY_LOGGED_IN and CKR_FUNCTION_FAILED. I implemented this changes based on the information provided in this <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pkcs11interop/pVI3ZWNMEKs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a> and in the section <strong>6.7.7 Example of use of sessions</strong> of this <a href=""http://pkcs11interop.net/rsa-pkcs11-2.20/pkcs-11v2-20.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">document</a> i.e. <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rwmhq.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rwmhq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>With my current Implementation I do not get any of these errors but would like to know expert opinion here.</p>

<p>Some of the questions that I have are:</p>

<p>Is it OK to use m_Pkcs11 in this fashion i.e. not disposing it through out the process life cycle?</p>

<p>Is it Ok to apply lock over the HSM login method? I am asking because I did not find any online reference suggesting this.</p>

<p>Is there a way of achieving this in a better manner?</p>
","<p>The answers to all your questions are ""hidden"" in <a href=""https://github.com/Pkcs11Interop/PKCS11-SPECS/tree/master/v2.20"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PKCS#11 v2.20 specificiation</a>.</p>

<p>See Chapter 6.6 for more info on not disposing <code>m_Pkcs11</code> through out the process life cycle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An application becomes a ""Cryptoki application"" by calling the
  Cryptoki function <code>C_Initialize</code> (see Section 11.4) from one of its
  threads; after this call is made, the application can call other
  Cryptoki functions. When the application is done using Cryptoki, it
  calls the Cryptoki function <code>C_Finalize</code> (see Section 11.4) and ceases
  to be a Cryptoki application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words you need to create instance of <code>Pkcs11</code> class only once and then all your threads can access PKCS#11 functions. I've seen apps that do use single instance of <code>Pkcs11</code> class and do not dispose it for months. It is a perfectly valid usage.</p>

<p>See chapter 6.7.4 for more info on login state:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Cryptoki, all sessions that an application has with a token must
  have the same login/logout status (i.e., for a given application and
  token, one of the following holds: all sessions are public sessions;
  all sessions are SO sessions; or all sessions are user sessions). When
  an application's session logs into a token, all of that application's
  sessions with that token become logged in, and when an application's
  session logs out of a token, all of that application’s sessions with
  that token become logged out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words once you login into one session, you are also logged in all existing sessions, and also in all sessions opened in the future. That is the main reason why you were getting <code>CKU_USER_ALREADY_LOGGED_IN</code> error.  I've seen apps that login into a single session and keep it open for months. BTW you can use <code>Session::GetSessionInfo()</code> method to check whether your session is already logged in or not.</p>

<p>For a real world example of class similar to yours please take a look at <a href=""https://github.com/jariq/Pkcs11Interop.PDF/blob/master/src/Pkcs11Interop.PDF/Pkcs11RsaSignature.cs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Pkcs11RsaSignature</code></a> class from <a href=""https://github.com/jariq/Pkcs11Interop.PDF"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pkcs11Interop.PDF</a> project.</p>

<p>I have already checked if the dll's are locked and ran as admin etc.
If you have any clue what's  responsable for the trouble here please let me know!</p>

<p>Thank you very much!</p>
","<p>This question was one of the first that appeared in my search results when doing some research on a similar topic. As it doesn't have an answer yet, I'll outline the results of my solution:</p>

<p>For using <a href=""https://github.com/OpenSC/libp11"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">libp11</a>'s PKCS#11 engine with OpenSSL, it must be compiled as dynamic engine that is statically linked against the OpenSSL version you are using. As you are using the <a href=""https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">binaries from Shining Light Productions</a> (a good guess based on the install directory you mentioned in your question), using a MSYS2 version obtained from a third-party resource might not work, neither does using the PKCS#11 library that ships with the OpenSC projects' <a href=""https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/releases/latest"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Windows installers</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the Shining Light Productions' OpenSSL version comes with all required libraries, so you can easily compile libp11 yourself, e.g. by using <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/nmake-reference?view=vs-2017"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NMAKE</a> (follow the link to see how to obtain it and how to properly setup your command line for its use):</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the <a href=""https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenSSL binaries</a> that meet your requirements (x86 or x64) and install them to the proposed standard destinations (e.g., <code>C:\OpenSSL-Win32</code> or <code>C:\OpenSSL-Win64</code>). - The makefile of libp11 expects these folders for its bindings.</li>
<li>Download and extract, or clone the <a href=""https://github.com/OpenSC/libp11"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">libp11</a> projects' source code.</li>
<li>Open your Windows command-line with NMAKE environment variables set and change to the location of the previously downloaded libp11 files.</li>
<li><p>When building for the 64 bit version of OpenSSL, you have to set the <code>BUILD_FOR</code> environment variable accordingly. Run</p>

<pre><code>set BUILD_FOR=WIN64
</code></pre>

<p>on your command-line.</p></li>
<li><p>Now compile the libraries by running</p>

<pre><code>NMAKE /F Makefile.mak
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If everything went well, you then have two new libraries within libp11's <code>src</code> folder: <code>libp11.dll</code> and <code>pkcs11.dll</code>. The latter is the PKCS#11 engine to use with your OpenSSL. Copy it to e.g., the Windows libraries folder (<code>System32</code> for the 32 bit version, <code>SysWOW64</code> for the x64 version).</p></li>
<li><p>Adapt your <code>openssl.cnf</code> file accordingly. Copy</p>

<pre><code>openssl_conf = openssl_init
</code></pre>

<p>to the beginning of the file, and the rest to its end:</p>

<pre><code>[openssl_init]
engines = engine_section

[engine_section]
pkcs11 = pkcs11_section

[pkcs11_section]
dynamic_path = ""C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\pkcs11.dll""
module_path = ""C:\\Users\\myUser\\Desktop\\SecureTemial\\yubihsm2-sdk\\bin\\yubihsm_pkcs11.dll""
PIN = ""0001password""
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Some final notes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure, that the adapted <code>openssl.cnf</code> file really is picked up by OpenSSL. The OpenSSL installation comes with several example files. By default, the location of the config files for above binaries is <code>C:\Program Files\Common Files\SSL\openssl.cnf</code> for the x64 version and <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\SSL\openssl.cnf</code> for the x86 version. But other OpenSSL installations on your system (e.g., from OpenVPN, MingW, MSYS2, and alike that ship with bundled OpenSSL) might interfere with the settings file location. You can ensure the right settings file is used by setting the <code>OPENSSL_CONF</code> environment variable accordingly.</li>
<li>When using double quotes for the Windows paths, make sure to escape the backslashes correctly by using <code>\\</code> instead of <code>\</code>.</li>
<li>You can safely omit the <code>engine_id</code> and <code>init</code> part of your <code>openssl.cnf</code>'s <code>[pkcs11_section]</code>.</li>
<li>While libp11's dynamic PKCS#11 engine needs to be compiled against the same architecture (x86 or x64) and libraries as OpenSSL, the module library might be required as 32 bit version (even when running the 64 bit build of OpenSSL). - At least that is what happened within the scenario of our systems (we use Gemalto Safenet e-Tokens, so the Aladdin module libraries that ship with the Safenet Authentication Client).</li>

"39795787","Create 3DES key with pkcs11Interop and output key value, or proivde key value for creation","<p>I was wondering whether it is possible using pkcs11interop to create a 3DES key and specify the key value for creation, or otherwise create a key and output the generated key value. Basically I need the secret key to be exported to another device. </p>

<p>I've tried using the CKA_VALUE attribute and passing the key as a byte[] array but with no success.</p>

<p>Is such thing possible please? Can someone assist me please? </p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Here is the code I have with no luck so far:</p>

<pre><code>public ObjectHandle generate3DESKey(string keyLabel)
{
ObjectHandle key = null;
// Generate symetric key 

// Prepare attribute template of new key
List&lt;ObjectAttribute&gt; objectAttributes = new List&lt;ObjectAttribute&gt;();
objectAttributes.Add(new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_TOKEN, true));
objectAttributes.Add(new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_CLASS, CKO.CKO_SECRET_KEY));
objectAttributes.Add(new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_KEY_TYPE, CKK.CKK_DES3));
objectAttributes.Add(new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_ENCRYPT, true));
objectAttributes.Add(new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_EXTRACTABLE, true));

objectAttributes.Add(new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_LABEL, keyLabel));


// Specify key generation mechanism
Mechanism mechanism = new Mechanism(CKM.CKM_DES3_KEY_GEN);

// Generate key
key = _session.GenerateKey(mechanism, objectAttributes);

List&lt;CKA&gt; retrieveTemplate = new List&lt;CKA&gt;();
retrieveTemplate.Add(CKA.CKA_VALUE);

var test = _session.GetAttributeValue(key, retrieveTemplate);
var testval = test[0].GetValueAsString();
return key;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So what I'm trying with this code is to create a 3DES key and then get it's value using the GetAttributeValue as instructed below. I've tried the GetValueAsByteArray and GetValueAsString but all without success. What I've noticed is that the the cannotread properties on the retrieved attribute is set to true even though I've set the extractable attribute on creation. </p>

<p>Apart from this I also contemplated passing the key value on generating the 3DES key however what puzzled me is the fact that documentation says that the key value used with the CKA.CKA_VALUE should be a byte array of length 24. In my case the key that I need to create is 16 length long and not 24. I want to create a key similar to this which is represented in hex over here: 1616161616161616 1010101010101010 </p>
","<p>Secret key can be imported with <code>Session::CreateObject()</code> method. You will need to specify correct object attributes as defined in PKCS#11 specification.</p>

<p>Plain form of secret key can be exported with <code>Session::GetAttributeValue()</code> method. Key object will need to have correct attributes specified to allow you to read its plain value.</p>

<p>Please read at least <em>""Chapter 10 - Objects""</em> and <em>""Chapter 12.15.3 - DES3 secret key objects""</em> of <a href=""https://github.com/Pkcs11Interop/Pkcs11Interop/blob/master/doc/rsa-pkcs11-2.20"" rel=""nofollow"">PKCS#11 v2.20 specification</a> and then post your code may you still be unable to solve your issue.</p>

<p>Please help. Thanks</p>
","<p>You are not correctly initializing your mechanism structure. The CK_MECHANISM is a structure that requires 3 parameters to be defined:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct CK_MECHANISM {
  CK_MECHANISM_TYPE mechanism;
  CK_VOID_PTR       pParameter;
  CK_ULONG          ulParameterLen;  /* in bytes */
} CK_MECHANISM;
</code></pre>

<p>You need to initialize your mechanism as follow:</p>

<pre><code>CK_MECHANISM  mechanism = { CKM_RSA_PKCS_OAEP, NULL_PTR, 0 };
</code></pre>

<p>If you generated your private-public key-pair as RSA key-pair (using CKM_RSA_PKCS_KEY_PAIR_GEN mechanism) e.g.</p>

<pre><code>CK_MECHANISM  GenMechanism = { CKM_RSA_PKCS_KEY_PAIR_GEN, NULL_PTR, 0 };
</code></pre>

<p>Then you need to initialize your mechanism for decryption as follow:</p>

<pre><code>CK_MECHANISM  mechanism   = { CKM_RSA_PKCS, NULL_PTR, 0};
</code></pre>

<p>I presume you are already logged in with your hsession and the hObject is the located private key to be used for decryption? </p>

I can read the Certificate fine, but sadly i can't extract the private key, so i can't use it to create my KeyStore. Since i don't get any Lib from the vendor and can't use the SUN implementation of PKCS11, since that is not supported by android, i guess i have to override the SSLContext to change the way it handles the signing process, so i can encrypt and decrypt the Handshake via the card?</p>

<p>Also i can't use the full PKCS11 API i got following methods:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CK_RV C_GenerateKeyPair</p>
  
  <p>CK_RV C_GenerateRandom</p>
  
  <p>CK_RV C_Decrypt</p>
  
  <p>CK_RV C_Sign</p>
  
  <p>CK_RV C_Encrypt</p>

<p>The login to the Card is handled beforehand by a different Software, so i already have access.</p>

<p>So basically two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there an easy way to handle the authentification without access
to the private key?</p></li>
<li><p>What or Where do i have to override to handle the SSL signing via the card?</p></li>

<p>There is <em>no</em> way to handle the authentication without access to the private key.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the purposes of these mechanisms, an ECDSA signature is an octet
  string of even length which is at most two times nLen octets, where
  nLen is the length in octets of the base point order n. The signature
  octets correspond to the concatenation of the ECDSA values r and s,
  both represented as an octet string of equal length of at most nLen
  with the most significant byte first. If r and s have different octet
  length, the shorter of both must be padded with leading zero octets
  such that both have the same octet length. Loosely spoken, the first
  half of the signature is r and the second half is s. For signatures
  created by a token, the resulting signature is always of length 2nLen.
  For signatures passed to a token for verification, the signature may
  have a shorter length but must be composed as specified before.</p>

<li><p>Why does my UNMANAGED Parallel loop throw an exception always? Even if I handle those exception, 40% of signings are getting failed (session.Sign() function returns null). Why is it so?</p></li>
<li><p>With ""MANAGED Parallel Loop"" code, I can achieve max speed of 280, as I got with Sequential Signing Loop. Why my MANAGED Parallel loop is slow? Is it because of '<em>lock</em>'? If I remove the <em>lock</em>, it becomes UNMANAGED PARALLEL LOOP. How can I handle this? </p></li>
<li><p>If you feel, my multithreading coding (and entire PKCS11 programming and operations) is wrong, please suggest me some method to achieve maximum speed. </p></li>
<li><p>If you feel, there could be a problem with PCKS11Interop Wrapper which is not letting me to achieve the speed, please suggest some other wrappers. I used NCryptoki, Pkcs11.Net Wrappers, but I could not achieve max speed. </p></li>

","<p>We also encountered the same issue. Specify the provider name when getting the Signing instance. When code to sign using HSM is called, there may some other piece of code in your application adding another provider [Security.insertProvider] which implements the same signing algorithm.
When your sign, you pass a parameter of Private Key handler for PKCS11 but the provider is expecting different Key handler of RSA.
Resolution:
When you get the HSM signing instance, specify the Security provider along with the signing algorithm.</p>

<p>The error dialog you want to suppress, how does it look like? Native? or Java/Swing-like? <br>
There are many ""layers"" involved in the process.<br></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Layers</strong><br>Let's break the process in 4 layers:<br><code>1-PKCS#11(native); 2-Wrappers[IAIK, SUN, Vendors]; 3-Providers[IAIK, SUN]; 4-JCA/JCE</code>
So your ""error-dialog"" is coming from one of these layers.<br>
From Layer-1: you have less control and you can just contact the vendors, just like @Eugene wrote. <br>
From Layer-2 to Layer-4, your control increases, so you might do something about it, if you implement the right callbacks.</li>

","<p>There's a <em>README.ENGINE</em> that provides a discussion of engines. I'm not sure how useful it will be since it makes some tall claims. For example, ""... the source code is reasonably well self-documenting, but some summaries and usage instructions are needed"".</p>

<p>But here's something on the <code>dynamic</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new ""dynamic"" ENGINE provides a low-overhead way to support
  ENGINE   implementations that aren't pre-compiled and linked into
  OpenSSL-based   applications. This could be because existing
  compiled-in implementations   have known problems and you wish to use
  a newer version with an existing   application. It could equally be
  because the application (or OpenSSL   library) you are using simply
  doesn't have support for the ENGINE you   wish to use, and the ENGINE
  provider (eg. hardware vendor) is providing   you with a
  self-contained implementation in the form of a shared-library.   The
  other use-case for ""dynamic"" is with applications that wish to<br>
  maintain the smallest foot-print possible and so do not link in
  various   ENGINE implementations from OpenSSL, but instead leaves you
  to provide   them, if you want them, in the form of ""dynamic""-loadable
  shared-libraries. It should be possible for hardware vendors to
  provide   their own shared-libraries to support arbitrary hardware to
  work with   applications based on OpenSSL 0.9.7 or later. If you're
  using an   application based on 0.9.7 (or later) and the support you
  desire is only   announced for versions later than the one you need,
  ask the vendor to   backport their ENGINE to the version you need.</p>
  
  <p>How does ""dynamic"" work?</p>

<pre><code>The dynamic ENGINE has a special flag in its implementation such that
every time application code asks for the 'dynamic' ENGINE, it in fact
gets its own copy of it. As such, multi-threaded code (or code that
multiplexes multiple uses of 'dynamic' in a single application in any
way at all) does not get confused by 'dynamic' being used to do many
independent things. Other ENGINEs typically don't do this so there is
only ever 1 ENGINE structure of its type (and reference counts are used
to keep order). The dynamic ENGINE itself provides absolutely no
cryptographic functionality, and any attempt to ""initialise"" the ENGINE
automatically fails. All it does provide are a few ""control commands""
that can be used to control how it will load an external ENGINE
implementation from a shared-library. To see these control commands,
use the command-line;

   openssl engine -vvvv dynamic

The ""SO_PATH"" control command should be used to identify the
shared-library that contains the ENGINE implementation, and ""NO_VCHECK""
might possibly be useful if there is a minor version conflict and you
(or a vendor helpdesk) is convinced you can safely ignore it.
""ID"" is probably only needed if a shared-library implements
multiple ENGINEs, but if you know the engine id you expect to be using,
it doesn't hurt to specify it (and this provides a sanity check if
nothing else). ""LIST_ADD"" is only required if you actually wish the
loaded ENGINE to be discoverable by application code later on using the
ENGINE's ""id"". For most applications, this isn't necessary - but some
application authors may have nifty reasons for using it. The ""LOAD""
command is the only one that takes no parameters and is the command
that uses the settings from any previous commands to actually *load*
the shared-library ENGINE implementation. If this command succeeds, the
(copy of the) 'dynamic' ENGINE will magically morph into the ENGINE
that has been loaded from the shared-library. As such, any control
commands supported by the loaded ENGINE could then be executed as per
normal. Eg. if ENGINE ""foo"" is implemented in the shared-library
""libfoo.so"" and it supports some special control command ""CMD_FOO"", the
following code would load and use it (NB: obviously this code has no
error checking);

   ENGINE *e = ENGINE_by_id(""dynamic"");
   ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, ""SO_PATH"", ""/lib/libfoo.so"", 0);
   ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, ""ID"", ""foo"", 0);
   ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, ""LOAD"", NULL, 0);
   ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, ""CMD_FOO"", ""some input data"", 0);

For testing, the ""openssl engine"" utility can be useful for this sort
of thing. For example the above code excerpt would achieve much the
same result as;

   openssl engine dynamic \
             -pre SO_PATH:/lib/libfoo.so \
             -pre ID:foo \
             -pre LOAD \
             -pre ""CMD_FOO:some input data""

Or to simply see the list of commands supported by the ""foo"" ENGINE;

   openssl engine -vvvv dynamic \
             -pre SO_PATH:/lib/libfoo.so \
             -pre ID:foo \
             -pre LOAD

Applications that support the ENGINE API and more specifically, the
""control commands"" mechanism, will provide some way for you to pass
such commands through to ENGINEs. As such, you would select ""dynamic""
as the ENGINE to use, and the parameters/commands you pass would
control the *actual* ENGINE used. Each command is actually a name-value
pair and the value can sometimes be omitted (eg. the ""LOAD"" command).
Whilst the syntax demonstrated in ""openssl engine"" uses a colon to
separate the command name from the value, applications may provide
their own syntax for making that separation (eg. a win32 registry
key-value pair may be used by some applications). The reason for the
""-pre"" syntax in the ""openssl engine"" utility is that some commands
might be issued to an ENGINE *after* it has been initialised for use.
Eg. if an ENGINE implementation requires a smart-card to be inserted
during initialisation (or a PIN to be typed, or whatever), there may be
a control command you can issue afterwards to ""forget"" the smart-card
so that additional initialisation is no longer possible. In
applications such as web-servers, where potentially volatile code may
run on the same host system, this may provide some arguable security
value. In such a case, the command would be passed to the ENGINE after
it has been initialised for use, and so the ""-post"" switch would be
used instead. Applications may provide a different syntax for
supporting this distinction, and some may simply not provide it at all
(""-pre"" is almost always what you're after, in reality).

<p>Is the SunPKCS11 class caching some data? If so, is there any way to clear this cache?</p>

","<p>As recommended in <a href=""https://github.com/Pkcs11Interop/Pkcs11Interop/tree/3.2.0#documentation"" rel=""nofollow"">official documentation</a> before you start using Pkcs11Interop you should get familiar at least with <em>""Chapter 2 - Scope""</em>, <em>""Chapter 6 - General overview""</em> and <em>""Chapter 10 - Objects""</em> of <a href=""https://github.com/Pkcs11Interop/Pkcs11Interop/blob/master/doc/rsa-pkcs11-2.20"" rel=""nofollow"">PKCS#11 v2.20 specification</a>.</p>

<p>Your code is first finding all objects regardless of their type (keys, certificates etc.) and then tries to read <code>CKA_VALUE</code> attribute of each individual object. <code>CKA_VALUE</code> is not valid attribute for all object types and I guess this might be causing your problems. Of course well behaving unmanaged PKCS#11 library would return <code>CKR_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE_INVALID</code> error instead of segfaulting but there are many poor quality PKCS#11 libraries out there that do not handle such corner cases well.</p>

<p>I recommend you to first read mentioned chapters of specification and then change the search template passed to <code>FindAllObjects()</code> method to search only for specific object types you are really interested in.</p>

Can we access session object O1 via S2? That is can we access the session object created by session linked to different token then the token operating session linked to?</p>

<hr>

<p>The question has raised from following place in cryptoki document: ""...That is, if a single application has multiple sessions open with a token, and it uses one of
them to create a session object, then that session object is visible through any of THAT
application’s sessions..."" THAT == multiple sessions open with a token ?</p>
","<p>I don' think you can access O1 (object that resides inside Token1) via S2 (session open with Token2).</p>

<p>For instance, let's assume an application connects to 2 different tokens and then creates 2 objects:</p>

<ul>
<li>An AES encryption key on Token 1</li>
<li>A wrappable RSA private key on Token 2</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, the application commands (on either session) to have the RSA key wrapped by AES key.
That's hardly possible because the two tokens are not aware of each other at all and won't allow that operation.</p>

","<p>I think the solution is simply to use <code>ENCRYPT</code> instead of <code>WRAP</code> and <code>DECRYPT</code> instead of <code>UNWRAP</code>.</p>

<p>To understand why, it is important to see what <code>WRAP</code> and <code>UNWRAP</code> do.  Basically they perform simply <code>ENCRYPT</code> and <code>DECRYPT</code> but they simply return a key. Now if you do this in software then there is no difference <em>except</em> for the fact that you don't need to use a <code>SecretKeySpec</code> or <code>SecretKeyFactory</code> to regenerate a key from the decrypted data.</p>

<p>However if you perform it on hardware then generally the resulting key will be kept on the hardware device (or Token). This is of course fine if you possess a HSM: it can just generate a (session specific) key and return a handle. But on smart cards this is generally not possible. And even if it was: you don't want to send all of the message to the smart card to let it encrypt.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you use Java you don't directly have control over the PKCS#11 input parameters to the wrapping or unwrapping calls.</p>

<hr>

<p>So try <code>ENCRYPT</code> and <code>DECRYPT</code> and then regenerate the key in software.</p>

<p>Alternatively you could replicate the <em>PKCS#11</em> wrap and unwrap calls using the Open Source IAIK wrapper library; mimicking the C functionality. But that would not be compatible with calls that require the <code>Cipher</code> class.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that <code>RSA</code> in Sun providers in all likelihood means <code>RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding</code>. If you need a different RSA algorithm then you should experiment with the algorithm string; this could also be the problem that you are facing: that you use the wrong algorithm.</p>

","<p>In the end we used this solution for the problem of making / verifying signatures and encryption / decryption from Java 8 with smart cards. It works on both Linux and Windows using 64 bit Java.</p>

"40418104","Where to find my FireFox profile? NSS cannot find external installed module/token in secmod.db","<p>NOTE: I have found the answer to this question so I would close it. It's due to that the method returning the FireFox profile folder is not working, it just locates the directory where all profiles are located, but does not enter <strong>my profile</strong> folder. And under this folder (for example, <code>/home/myUserName/.mozilla/firefox/</code>, there are also <code>key3.db</code>, <code>cert8.db</code> and <code>secmod.db</code>, but it does not contain any user-specific settings, and I guess they serve as the base for creating all profiles the moment they are created. That's why they are not containing my added modules. Under this folder, I have <code>5yasix1g.default-1475600224376</code> where my profile is located, and that's where my <code>key3.db</code>, <code>cert8.db</code> and <code>secmod.db</code> are located.</p>

<p>I leave the question here and change the title to warn people who like me may have difficulties finding where their FF profiles are.</p>

<hr>

<p>I managed to get NSS/JSS to work in my Ubuntu 16.04, but it only finds one module, the default NSS internal one. </p>

<p>I have these modules installed:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FAtgL.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FAtgL.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>What I must load, is that one of Izenpe and DNIe. But when I debug, it only loads the first one.</p>

<p>With <code>modutil</code> shipped with NSS/NSPR, I have found the same. A checking of </p>

<pre><code>modutil -list -dbdir /home/myUserName/.mozilla/firefox
</code></pre>

<p>only shows one module.</p>

<p>(Another thing is that <code>-dbdir</code>'s value should end with the directory where <code>secmod.db</code> is located, not the file itself, or <code>modutil</code> throws confusing error message, complaining: </p>

<pre><code>modutil: function failed: SEC_ERROR_LEGACY_DATABASE: The certificate/key database is in an old, unsupported format.
</code></pre>

<p>)</p>

<p>I know I can add them and I am doing it, but it's weird that it's listed in FireFox but not in <code>secmod.db</code>. Isn't this file the database for all the installed modules that FF uses?</p>

<p>Also, after adding it, I cannot get access to external module. <code>modutil -dbdir ""/some/dir/properly/quoted"" -list</code> shows me this:</p>

<pre><code>easternfox@easternfox-Ubuntu:~$ modutil -dbdir /home/easternfox/.mozilla/firefox -list

}
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming from an exception thrown when specifying more then once the <code>name</code> property in the <code>config</code>, I suppose that I can load only one module in the Provider. </p>

<p>And, with these code I initialize the <code>CryptoManager</code>:</p>

<pre><code>try {
    InitializationValues iv = new InitializationValues(NSS_JSS_Utils.getFireFoxProfilePath());
    iv.installJSSProvider = false;
    CryptoManager.initialize(iv);
    cm = CryptoManager.getInstance();
} catch (KeyDatabaseException | CertDatabaseException | GeneralSecurityException | NotInitializedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (AlreadyInitializedException e) {
    cm = CryptoManager.getInstance();
}
CustomPasswordCallback pcb = new CustomPasswordCallback();
cm.setPasswordCallback(pcb);

Enumeration&lt; ? &gt; emModules = cm.getModules();
</code></pre>

<p>When it reaches the final line, it only loads the internal module, not mine external ones.</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated. Thanks!</p>

","<p>Unfortunately PKCS#11 API does not provide details which exact attribute from supplied template caused the error but many PKCS#11 libraries support some kind of internal logging mechanism which may reveal the real cause of error.

","<p>First of all, I have noticed the different way you insert/add <code>Provider</code> with me. Can you try to add the <code>Provider</code> this way? (it may be irrelavent)</p>

<pre><code>Provider p = new SunPKCS11(new ByteArrayInputStream(config.getBytes()));
Security.insertProviderAt(p, 1);

  <p>@will-Do, nss folks were able to track this issue down and seems like they are going to consider a change in <code>NSS_InitContext()</code>, which should include a <code>SECMOD_RestartModules(PR_FALSE)</code> after a <code>fork()</code>. Anyway, they also provided a better workaround than the one I provided you. If you set the environment variable <code>NSS_STRICT_NOFORK</code> to <code>DISABLED</code> then the code is expected to work. It worked for me and I'd like to check if it works for you as well. Looking forward to see your results.</p>

","<p>The libraries provided by Firefox in Mac OS X might actually be completely broken or non-functional if execute outside of FireFox.</p>

<p>After trying many different combination of configuration and ways, I finally got it working <strong>by NOT using the libraries from Firefox</strong>...</p>

<p>Here is the step by step ways to get it to work:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install homebrew in your Mac </li>
<li>Run <code>brew install nss</code></li>
<li>Run <code>brew install nspr</code></li>
<li>You may need to manually link them with <code>brew link nss</code> and <code>brew link nspr</code></li>
<li>In the configuration file, you need to point it to your homebrew <code>libsoftokn3.dylib</code>, like so <code>library = /usr/local/opt/nss/lib/libsoftokn3.dylib</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Then your Java code should be able to load the Firefox keystore under Mac OS X... I've filed a bug <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1418065"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. The ticket contains a working <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1418065#c1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sample code</a> on how to instantiate the PKCS11, load the Firefox keystore and list the aliases from the store.</p>

<p>This was definitely a nightmare working with Firefox... but at least I got it working... Who would've thought the libraries they provided doesn't work (but it worked in Windows!)? :P</p>

<p>For completeness, I've included the sample code directly in this post as well:</p>

","<p>The most probable cause:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your <code>ulCount</code> variable gets overwritten by <code>C_FindObjects()</code> to <code>1</code>.</li>
<li>You need to re-assign it to <code>4</code> again before calling the <code>C_GetAttributeValue</code>.</li>
<li>This way your code reads only the first attribute in the template.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Some additional (random) notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>As you do not call <code>C_Login()</code>, you can view/access only public objects (objects with set CKA_PRIVATE are hidden for you).</li>
<li>Zero <code>ulCount</code> argument for <code>C_FindObjectsInit()</code> causes that your code enumerates all token objects -- you probably wanted the <code>CKA_CLASS</code> and <code>CKA_LABEL</code> filter to be effective.</li>
<li>I would recommend not to use the same template for <code>C_FindObjectsInit()</code> and <code>C_GetAttributeValue()</code></li>
<li>Your <code>dataValue</code> buffer is quite small -- are you sure that the value will fit?</li>
</ul>

So I temporarily create a DES3 key on our HSM, then I'd like to wrap (encrypt) my RSA private key with it, then I want to unwrap it on the HSM.</p>

<p>My code looks like this:</p>

    tempKeyAttributes.Add(new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_CLASS, CKO.CKO_SECRET_KEY));

    // Encrypt (wrap) the RSA private key

<p>This doesn't work, it fails with <code>CKR_INVALID_MECHANISM</code>.</p>

<p>You do not need a virtual smart card to implement a PKCS#11 provider.</p>

<p>All you need is to develop a library implementing the <a href=""https://www.oasis-open.org/standards#pkcs11-base-v2.40"" rel=""nofollow"">PKCS#11 API</a> which leverages your server.</p>

<p>The clients then can use this library as any other PKCS#11 provider.</p>

"39233560","Verify ECDSA signature from PyKCS11","<p>I have a python program which uses PyKCS11, a python wrapper for pkcs11 interface. I can sign data with a ECC private key (Mechanism CKM_ECDSA) that is stored on a HSM and that is accessed by PyKCS11.</p>

<p>What I now want is to verify with openssl the ECDSA signature by the corresponding public key. This public key is contained in a x509 (NewCert.pem) which was created out of the private key in the HSM.</p>

<p>I tested many ways to verify the signature properly, but I didn't succeed.</p>

<pre><code>openssl dgst -ecdsa-with-SHA1 -verify &lt;(openssl x509 -noout -pubkey -in NewCert.pem) -signature &lt;(cat sign | base64 -d) file
</code></pre>

<p>The file 'signature' contains the base64 encoded signature. And the file 'file' the plain data.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>
","<p>Finally I found a solution for my problem.</p>

<p>I)
The signature output of PyKCS11 is the concatenation of the r and s value of the ECDSA signature. It is not formatted in ASN1 style. This was the first problem why verification with openssl is not possible, because the latter requires this format.</p>

<p>II)
So I wrote a function that formats the PyKCS11 output to ASN1 conformity and saves the binary signature output to a file.</p>

<p>III)
In order to use hashing functions you first have to hash the data or the file to be signed. This can be done in Python with the command <em>digest()</em> of hashlib. After this you give this <strong>binary</strong> hash of the data as input to PyKCS11 and create the signature.</p>

<p>IV)
Verification of the hashed ECDSA signature can be done with the following command in openssl:</p>

<pre><code>openssl dgst -sha384 -verify pubkey -signature file.sign file
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure that <em>pubkey</em> is the EC public key from the corresponding x509 certificate (not the x509 itself). And <em>file.sign</em> means to be the binary file which contains the ECDSA signature that represents the binary hash of the original data (see step III).</p>

<p>Hope this helps for somebody else.</p>

KeyStore keystore = KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS11"");

keystore.load(null, pwd);

keystore.deleteEntry(alias);

keystore.setCertificateEntry(alias, cert);

//now when I run the same certutil.exe command I see empty trust attributes i.e. "",,"".
</code></pre>

<p>I'm still able to reload the same keystore (and certificate) and SSL authentication works flawlessly however, when the app is restarted and the keystore is reloaded again, the certificate is unavailable in the list of trusted aliases. </p>

<p>Why things fail to work only when the app is restarted is also a mystery to me.</p>

<p>I know that I should look for errors in my own code. 
I do not know what I should do next, so I ask You for help explaining the error.</p>

<p>I use openssl function in the following order:</p>

<p><code>ENGINE_load_builtin_engines</code></p>

<p><code>ENGINE_by_id</code> returns pointer to engine</p>

<p><code>ENGINE_register_complete</code> returns 1</p>

<p><code>ENGINE_get_id</code> returns pkcs11 (engine id)</p>

<p><code>ENGINE_get_name</code> returns pkcs11 engine (engine name)</p>

<p><code>ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string</code>  (MODULE_PATH) returns 1</p>

<p><code>ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string</code>  (PIN) returns 1</p>

<p><code>ENGINE_init</code> returns 1</p>

<p><code>ENGINE_load_private_key</code> returns PEVP_PKEY &lt;> nil</p>

<p><code>SSL_CTX_use_certificate</code> returns 1</p>

<p><code>SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey</code> returns 1</p>

<p><code>SSL_CTX_check_private_key</code> returns 1</p>

<p>I tried to use <code>ENGINE_load_ssl_client_cert</code>, but I can not.
As I noticed, in struct ENGINE, field load_ssl_client_cert is nil.
I do not know if this is normal.
I have 2 cards and in all there is the same effect.
I read the certificate from the attributes of the card.</p>

<p>If anyone has an idea for a solution, please help.</p>

<p>Here's the code</p>

<p>But when I run this code it will throw the next error:</p>

<p>Could anybody tell me what I'm doing wrong and how to solve this problem ? </p>
","<p>If you want to acquire <code>ObjectHandle</code> for an existing key you need to <strong>find</strong> the key by its attributes such as label etc. Key derivation is completely different cryptographic operation.</p>

List&lt;ObjectAttribute&gt; objectAttributes = new List&lt;ObjectAttribute&gt;();
objectAttributes.Add(new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_CLASS, CKO.CKO_SECRET_KEY));
objectAttributes.Add(new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_KEY_TYPE, CKK.CKK_DES3));
objectAttributes.Add(new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_ENCRYPT, true));
objectAttributes.Add(new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_DECRYPT, true));
objectAttributes.Add(new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_DERIVE, true));
objectAttributes.Add(new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_EXTRACTABLE, true));

// Specify key generation mechanism
Mechanism mechanism = new Mechanism(CKM.CKM_RSA_PKCS);

// Generate key
ObjectHandle baseKey = session.GenerateKey(mechanism, objectAttributes);

byte[] dt = session.GenerateRandom(24);

// Specify mechanism parameters
var mechanismParams = new CkKeyDerivationStringData(dt);

// Specify derivation mechanism with parameters
Mechanism mech = new Mechanism(CKM.CKM_RSA_PKCS, mechanismParams);

// Derive key
ObjectHandle derivedKey = session.DeriveKey(mech, baseKey, null);


byte[] byteContent = (ConvertUtils.Utf8StringToBytes(""Hello World!""));
byte[] signature = session.Sign(mech, derivedKey, byteContent);
</code></pre>

<p>But when I run this code it will throw the next error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Method C_GenerateKey returned CKR_MECHANISM_INVALID</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could anybody tell me what I'm doing wrong and how to solve this problem ? </p>
","<p>First, I think I'll be referencing pkcs-11v2-20.pdf a few times, so grab it if don't already have a copy (it comes with helpful examples, too).</p>

<p>Second, I'm not a C# programmer, so anything below is unfortunately only pseudo code.</p>

<p>Let's first address the CKR_MECHANISM_INVALID issue:
According to the standard, CKM.CKM_RSA_PKCS can't be used for C_DeriveKey (Chp. 12, Table 34).</p>

<p>And now the problem at hand:
You already have a key pair on your smart card (and opened a session and logged in as required), you have to search what you need using 
C_FindObjectsInit, C_FindObjects and C_FindObjectsFinal (pg. 136 and following, also gives some example), 
where you provide C_FindObjectsInit with an attribute template of what kind of key you are looking for, e.g. </p>

<pre><code>// look for key allowing signing and decrypting
var searchCriteria = new List&lt;ObjectAttribute&gt;();
searchCriteria.Add(new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_DECRYPT, true));
searchCriteria.Add(new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_SIGN, true));

// initialize the search. The number is actually the number of search attributes.
session.FindObjectsInit(searchCriteria, 2);
...
session.FindObjects(out privateKeyHandle, ...);
... 
session.FindObjectsFinal();

// we found the requested private key, now sign the message
session.Sign(..., privateKeyHandle,...);
</code></pre>

<p>The key derivation you tried in the last snippet is meant for scenarios where the smart card and the application need to derive one or two shared secret key(s) (e.g. for secure messaging) by means of asymmetric cryptography.</p>

<p>Hope that helped.</p>

","<p>There are 2 things that i have noticed in your piece of code :-</p>

<p>While initializing the PSource don`t initialize ""<strong>iv</strong>"" parameter it again , instead use the argument value from the method . </p>

<p>So instead of using </p>

<pre><code>`PSource pSrc = (new PSource.PSpecified(new byte[256]));`
</code></pre>

<p>try using</p>

<pre><code>PSource pSrc = (new PSource.PSpecified(iv));
</code></pre>

<p>Also in the you are using SHA-256 , however while initializing OAEPParameterSpec used for OAEP padding , you are using SHA-1 instead of SHA-256 for MGF1ParameterSpec</p>

<p>So instead of using</p>

<pre><code> OAEPParameterSpec paramSpec = new OAEPParameterSpec(""SHA-256"", ""MGF1"", MGF1ParameterSpec.SHA1, pSrc);
</code></pre>

<p>try using :-</p>

<pre><code>OAEPParameterSpec paramSpec = new OAEPParameterSpec(""SHA-256"", ""MGF1"", MGF1ParameterSpec.SHA256, pSrc);

<p>Hope this will work for you...

<p>So, is it possible to connect to the multiple HSMs at any one time?</p>
","<p>I'm not sure whether this question is referring to the ability to connect to separate HSMs for separate functions, or to load-balance and provide failover between the HSMs.</p>

<p>For the first scenario, if you have multiple HSMs registered with the client, they should show up as separate slots and you can use the desired slot in your PKCS #11 code:</p>

<pre><code>Output from ckdemo option 11 (Slot Info):

Slots available:
        slot#1 - LunaNet Slot
        slot#2 - LunaNet Slot
</code></pre>

<p>As Raj mentioned, Safenet Luna HSMs do have a High Availability (HA) mode that allows load-balancing and failover.  To expand on that answer, if you configure your HSMs for HA use and create a HA group on your Safenet client using the vtl haAdmin command, you will see a virtual slot in addition to the separate slots for the individual HSMs:</p>

<p>Output from ckdemo option 11 (Slot Info):</p>

<pre><code>Slots available:
        slot#1 - LunaNet Slot
        slot#2 - LunaNet Slot
        slot#3 - HA Virtual Card Slot 
</code></pre>

<p>You can now use that Virtual slot in your PKCS #11 code to interface with the HSMs in the HA pool and the Safenet client software will take care of determining how to route the requests between the HSMs.</p>

"52220368","Unwrapping RSA encrypted AES key using Safenet HSM and Java leaks the unwrapped key","<p>I am using a Safenet HSM (Hardware Security Module) to store my cryptographic keys, and I am trying to unwrap a secret key (AES/DES) encrypted with RSA using Java APIs and SunPKCS11. I would like to do this securely, so that unwrapped AES/DES key cannot be extracted from the HSM (like the RSA private key value is invisible). However, after unwrapping the value of the unwrapped key is visible in the key object outside the HSM.</p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>Key privateKey = keyStore.getKey(""MyKeyId"", keyStorePassword);

Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"", ""SunPKCS11-Safenet"");
cipher.init(Cipher.UNWRAP_MODE, privateKey);
Key unwrappedKey = cipher.unwrap(wrappedKey, ""AES"", Cipher.SECRET_KEY);
// At this point the unwrapped key is visible in the unwrappedKey object!
</code></pre>

<p>How I can tell the code not to reveal the unwrapped key? Do I have to add something in the PKCS11 config file? I've tried adding the options below into the config file, but it doesn't seem to help:</p>

<pre><code>attributes(*,CKO_SECRET_KEY,*) = {
  CKA_SENSITIVE=true
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am not sure if revealing keys during unwrapping is expected from the API. If so, how I can import such keys securely into the HSM so that they cannot be extracted from it?</p>

<p>I've tried asking the Safenet support team, but they could not answer why this is happening. So, after lots of trying and searching the Internet, I have asked this question here.</p>
","<p>If you unwrap the key... you get back the key.  ie, unwrapping a key exposes the key.  If you are asking the HSM to unwrap the key, it is doing what you told it to do.</p>

<p>Maybe you want to <em>import</em> the key instead, if the HSM supports this operation.  The assumption on key import is that the HSM understands the format in which the key has been wrapped for security/protection/transport.  </p>

<p>It will then do the unwrap for you, and save the unwrapped key in its database.  Maybe it then hands you back the key as a <em>handle</em>, or as a differently wrapped key (ie, wrapped using its internal master key).</p>

<p>Moving a key between comparable HSMs is export/import or backup/restore, depending on the device and the devices' understanding of those verbs.</p>

<p>Moving a key between different vendor's HSMs or different cryptosystems, <em>without exposing the secrets</em> is an interesting exercise. </p>

Is there a way to achieve it programmatically? Thanks.</p>
","<p>You can, (<strong>HOWEVER, IT IS NOT ADVISABLE</strong>), provided if the hardware token manufacturer supports it and if you have created your PKCS#11 Objects as extractable.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: <em>What you are trying to do is <strong>NOT</strong> secure. You are taking away the purpose of what the hardware tokens are meant to do. Once a secret Object is created in a hardware token, it doesn't see the light of the day.</em></p>

<p>For a PKCS11 Object to be extractable, you have to set the <code>CKA_EXTRACTABLE</code> to <code>true</code>, <code>CKA_NEVER_EXTRACTABLE</code> to <code>false</code>, <code>CKA_SENSITIVE</code> to <code>false</code> and <code>CKA_ALWAYS_SENSITIVE</code> to <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>Most hardware token manufacturer's don't support this. Assuming that you have found a vendor who supports this, and you have created the PKCS11 Objects with the above attributes, you can do it as below.</p>

<p>You can loop through your PKCS11 KeyStore instance entries by calling <code>aliases()</code> and find each entry in it. It can either be a KeyPair (PublicKey and PrivateKey) or a Certificate or a Data Object (if it is PIV SmartCard token). You can have another instance of JKS KeyStore and you can now do <code>jksKS.setEntry(...)</code> or <code>jksKS.setCertificateEntry(...)</code>.</p>

<p>If the token doesn't support creation of non-sensitive data, you won't be able to create the PKCS11 Object with the above attributes in the first place.
If the token doesn't support extraction, the PKCS11 token would throw exception saying that sensitive data cannot be extracted.</p>

","<p>I think your error stems from the fact that your program has the right headers (functions definitions), but not the implementation of said functions. 
Before you start to use the PKCS#11 functions implemented in your DLL (opensc-pkcs11.so, in your case), you actually have to load it.</p>

<p>I'm no pro on DLL loading in unix systems, but i think <a href=""http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/dlopen.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> should do the trick. </p>

<p>On a side note, i'd strongly advise you to always call C_Finalize(...) after a call to C_Initialize.</p>

The protocol is proprietary but uses standard crypto mechanisms (rsa sha)</p>

<p>At a securre channel setup we receive a stack of certificates, with the last one 
the remote device personal cert.
This chain must be validated, in high level languages, no problem.
But I could not find any example how this is done with the pkcs11 interface.
I have the impression there is <strong>no</strong> cert chain verification method in pkcs11?
Must I disect every cert and calculate the signature with the basic pkcs11 
functions? And this is not very secure, you would want to pass the whole stack to a HSM, which reports back: OK or NOT. In case of OK the public key of the (in our case) device cert could be used to crypt a random channel key, etc etc.</p>

<p>So the question is , how is this normally done with pkcs11?</p>
","<p>X.509 certificate chain validation is high level operation which is not directly supported in rather low-level PKCS#11 API (same goes for certificate signing request generation, certificate issuance etc.).

","<p>When you get a certificate through the <code>pkcs#11</code> native calls you have no private key attached. The private key does the decrypting so we need it.To get around this you have two options:</p>

What is the correct way to import or generate keys other than keytool so that they are visible to java pkcs11 keystore?</p>

<p>Generate keys:</p>

<p>See the exception when trying to get the private key above.</p>
","<p>Keytool automatically generates a self-signed certificate when it generates a key entry, whereas PKCS#11 allows to create a key pair without a corresponding certificate.</p>

<p>The Java keystore API simply ignores key pair entries without a certificate. That's why <code>keytool -list ...</code> does not show the entry when it was created with <code>pkcs11-tool</code>. If you take a look at the <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html#KeyStoreRestrictions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Oracle PKCS#11 guide</a> and especially the restrictions, it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once a private key and certificate have been matched (and its certificate chain built), the information is stored in a private key entry with the CKA_LABEL value from end entity certificate as the KeyStore alias.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>Any private key or certificate object not part of a private key entry or trusted certificate entry is ignored.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, when you call <code>keyStore.getEntry(""jtest"", null);</code> it does not find a matching key entry, which causes the NPE in the following line.</p>

<pre><code>class WebServer(http.server.HTTPServer)
...
...
</code></pre>

<p>To enable <strong>ssl connections</strong> a ssl context is created within the server by</p>

<pre><code>self.ssl_context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)
self.ssl_context.load_cert_chain(certfile=cert, keyfile=key)
self.ssl_context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED
self.ssl_context.load_verify_locations(verifyCert)
</code></pre>

<p>Note: cert is a file path to the certificate, keyfile is the path to the private key.</p>

<p>Upon a request the method get_request is called:</p>

<pre><code>def get_request(self):
    request = self.socket.accept()
    if self.ssl_context:
        req_socket, addr = request
        connstream = self.ssl_context.wrap_socket(req_socket, server_side=True)
        return connstream, addr
    else:
        return request
</code></pre>

<p>The wrap_socket method is used to wrap the original socket into a ssl socket, which is returned instead. That is all to provide a ssl connection.</p>

<p><strong>Now the question:</strong></p>

<p>The solution is a first implementation and not secure. We are oblidged to use a given hardware security module (HSM) to create and store certificates and private keys. Any private keys are completely hidden and will never leave the module. All cryptographic primitives have to be executed directly within the module. The interface to the HSM is PKCS#11, for which a vendor supplied dynamic middle-ware library exists.</p>

<p>How can I use the module instead of the original ssl for setup of the ssl context under python? I know already, that ssl is based on openSSL, for which a PKCS#11 engine exists (libarary opensc-pkcs11.so). The middleware from the vendor provides the PKCS#11 API. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have no plan how the PKCS#11 engine is to be integrated into python's ssl/openSSL and how to tie all things together. Is it even possible to transparently use PKCS#11 instead of the native implementation, and if yes, how do I activate it from python? Moreover, how would I have to pass the arguments ""certfile"" and ""keyfile"", because both are not available anymore as plain files? In fact I have no access to the private key directly; there are only URL-based references to objects within the HSM used to operate on it.</p>

<p>Can PyKCS11 be a solution instead of ssl?</p>

<p>I just need to know the basic path to solving such problem. I can find all the details on my own.</p>

","<p>TEngineer,</p>

<p>Microsoft has a nice article here that will help you:
<a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/how-to-sign-xml-documents-with-digital-signatures"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/how-to-sign-xml-documents-with-digital-signatures</a></p>

<p>The key thing you need to understand is that the role of a HSM is to protect the private key, as such, largely, it is not possible to export the private key.</p>

<p>The good news it is not necessary.</p>

<p>What Windows does is give you an abstraction for cryptographic algorithms that can be implemented by hardware devices like an HSM.</p>

<p>There are actually several of those abstractions, that said the article I link to above points at Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP).</p>

<p>The basic concept is that when you go to do the cryptographic operation it is remoted to the device which does the 'math' and returns the ciphertext.</p>

<p>In other platforms a different abstraction is used, it is called PKCS#11, if you were looking to write crossplatform code you would at using a binding to that interface. Also if you needed to do other operations with the HSM you would look at using something like <a href=""https://pkcs11interop.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://pkcs11interop.net/</a> to call that interface from C#. </p>

<p>This fails always at the line <code>objects = findObjects(1);</code> with a CKR_TEMPLATE_INCONSISTENT exception. </p>

<p>As I understand from the documentation <code>session.findObjectsInit(null)</code> should just return all accessible objects on the card and you can then compare them for type. </p>

<p>I have various smartcards and they all fail like this, I've also tried calling <code>session.findObjectsInit(tempObj)</code> with a GenericTemplate object and a X509PublicKeyCertificate which both return the same exception, and with an X509AttributeCertificate which returns no objects but does not throw the exception.</p>

<p>I'd appreciate any pointers anyone can give. Or do I need to create a matching template object using GenericTemplate? I'm unsure why I'm getting the exception as I thought passing the object into the getObjectInit method filtered for thet object so anything returned should match.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
I've subsequently tried with other templates and ones for objects not on the card just return an empty array- no exception and ones I think are on the cards just throw the ckr_template_inconsistent exception, any help would be gratefully received.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2</strong>
I've now tried with some new 'V3' cards, which do infact work, all my test cards work using another technique (we currently use capicom via com4J for signing), so maybe there is an issue with the iaik wrapper, or gclib.dll (or me).  </p>

"52847522","TLS handshake error from ... tls: client didn't provide a certificate","<p>I have a C# RestFull client trying to connect to a Go server. Once I reach the TLS handshake stage it fails because <strong>client didn't provide a certificate</strong>.</p>

<p>I have verified that client certificate was associated with RestClient Object before the execution of the request.</p>

<pre><code>// Initializing the client
RestClient client = new RestClient(Config.SERVER_DOMAIN);

// Adding client certificate (exported from a smart card with no private key attributes)
client.ClientCertificates = Global.cpf.getCertCollection();

// defining our request then executing it
var request = new RestRequest(""users"", Method.GET);
var response = await client.ExecuteTaskAsync(request);
</code></pre>

<p>It works only if the certificate was read from a .PFX file where the private component is there. But when I switch to smart card certificate (which has no private key attributes because the smart card doesn't want you to have them) the server doesn't receive any certificate from the client.</p>

<p>I understand that TLS needs a private key for the handshake stage, yet the client obj doesn't see any associated private key with the given certificate and therefore doesn't recognize the certificate as a valid one for TLS establishment. </p>

<p>I know that private keys can't be exported from the smart card, and I know that there has to be a way to tell RestClient object that in order to pass handshake stage, you should communicate with the smart card, however, I gave up!</p>

<p>Can someone point me to the right direction?</p>
","<p>For most of the smartcards there should be minidriver or standalone CSP (Cryptographic Service Provider) available. These components act as a drivers that integrate the card with Windows cryptographic subsystem. They are usually provided by the device vendor and you should be able to get your certificate with reference to correct private key from your Windows Certificate Store once they're set up correctly.</p>

<p>Try to use the following method:</p>

<pre><code>private static X509Certificate2 GetCertificate()
{
    X509Store store = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.CurrentUser);
    store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);

    try

<p>BTW the smart card has no internal certificate associated with it, its just a dumb smart card with a private key store.</p>

<p>So my question is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What kind of code should I write to obtain a certificate from the PKCS#11 library, or do I need to write such code? does PKCS#11 supports exporting certificates?(I heard openssl supports using 3rd party PKCS#11 libraries. Can I use that to export a certificate from a smart card?)</p></li>
<li><p>If the answer to previous question is yes, in what kind of format is the certificate created? What kind of conversions should I to do in order to convert the raw created certificate into office supported format certificate?</p></li>
<li><p>and the last question is how to apply that certificate into microsoft office(2013) in order to digitally sign documents? It looks like that office itself doesn't like internal certificates and it keeps requesting us to get one from verisign (?) what's wrong here and how can I force office to use my own created certificate using the aforementioned method?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>PKCS#11 interface lets you read (""export"") the certificate from the hardware. However you need not just a certificate, but also a private key. Most hardware devices won't let you export a private key. PKCS#11 has a set of functions which let you perform cryptographic operations using private keys stored in the hardware, but not to export those keys. </p>

<p>The certificate is usually exported in native DER format, which can later be put to the PFX file. However without a private key it doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I don't know what MS Office expects. I assume that Office in your case accepts only certificates which can be validated up to the trusted root certificate.</p>

<p>I would like to know which attribute of PKCS#11 object is inconsistent and fix it.</p>
","<p>It is quite tricky to find exactly what attribute is missing or provided incorrectly. The only way you could fix this is by trial and error. Since this exception is thrown by the token, it wouldn't be logged, which makes it much difficult to solve.</p>

<p>I would recommend first to better understand what type of token you are dealing with. This will give you a better idea of what type of object template it would expect.</p>

<p>For example, if the token only allows you to create <code>sensitive</code> keys, if you set the attribute value as <code>false</code>, the token would complain. So you have to try a combination of attributes and see if it succeeds in creating the object.</p>

<p>Another thing you could do is, if, the token comes with its own sdk or tools, that can interact with the token and create objects, create a test object using their sdk/tool, and then use the PKCS#11 interface to extract the object and see what template it has. You could use this as a base template.</p>

<p>If it doesn't you can try to create an object starting with a minimal template, with required values, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Id (some random value)</li>
<li>Label (alias name)</li>
<li>Token (true recommended)</li>
<li>Sensitive (true recommended)</li>
<li>Algorithm/Mechanism (CKM_RSA_PKCS_KEY_PAIR_GEN / CKM_AES_KEY_GEN)</li>

","<p>As Eugene Mayevski <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/36445748/5128464"">writes</a> there is no such concept as ""object PIN"" in PKCS#11.</p>

<p>You may implement some variant of the following schema to get similar access control model:</p>

<p>Enrolling a key-pair:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Generate a key-pair via <code>C_GenerateKeyPair</code> and ensure the private key is generated as a session-only object (i.e. with <code>CKA_TOKEN==FALSE</code>). An alternative is to import the key pair somehow (not to be discussed here).</p></li>
<li><p>Generate a strong password (or use a user supplied one) and run it through some <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">KDF</a> to get ""unlocking key"". Keep this ""unlocking key"" in your application memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate a new persistent symmetric ""derivation key"" which allows key derivation only (i.e. <code>CKA_TOKEN==TRUE</code> and <code>CKA_DERIVE==TRUE</code>) using e.g. <code>CKM_AES_KEY_GEN</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Derive a new ""wrap key"" session-only key object using e.g. <code>CKM_AES_CBC_ENCRYPT_DATA</code> with the ""unblocking key"" bytes as input diversification data and using the ""derivation key"" as a master key. The new key should be a session-only object and should allow only key wrapping (i.e. <code>CKA_TOKEN==FALSE</code> and <code>CKA_WRAP==TRUE</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Wrap the private key object from step 1 using the ""wrap key"" into ""key blob"".</p></li>
<li><p>Store the ""key blob"" (inside token or outside of it).</p></li>
<li><p>Delete the private key from step 1 and the ""wrap key"". Nuke password and ""unlocking key"". (Do this step even if some of the previous steps fail)</p></li>
<li><p>The private key should not be accessible without knowing the password.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Using a key-pair:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Run the input password through the same KDF to get the ""unlocking key"".</p></li>
<li><p>Derive the ""wrap key"" in the same way as during the key enrollment but this time for unwrapping only (i.e. <code>CKA_TOKEN==FALSE</code> and <code>CKA_UNWRAP==TRUE</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Unwrap the ""key blob"" into a new session-only private key object.</p></li>
<li><p>Delete the ""wrap key"". Nuke password and ""unlocking key"". (Do this step even if some of the previous steps fail)</p></li>
<li><p>Use the key-pair at your will.</p></li>
<li><p>Delete the private key. (Do this step even if some of the previous steps fail)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Wiping the key-pair:</p>

<ol>
<li>Delete the associated ""derivation key"" and ""key blob"".</li>
</ol>

<p>Some additional (random) notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The used AES mechanisms are just examples. You would have to store the used IV together with ""key blob"" if using <code>CKM_AES_CBC_ENCRYPT_DATA</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Pay a lot of attention to all object attribute values (i.e. deny everything what is not needed). If your device supports some vendor defined extensions to control object usage then do use them (e.g. to enforce wrap/unwrap/derive mechanisms allowed).</p></li>
<li><p>Remember to wipe/delete passwords and temporary keys from memory/session.</p></li>
<li><p>Use vendor specific wrapping mechanisms as they probably provide better protection (if possible).</p></li>
<li><p>A convenient way to delete session objects is to close the session.</p></li>
<li><p>You may want to protect the integrity of the ""key blob"" if it is not provided by the wrapping mechanism.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck!</p>

","<p>The idea of PKCS#11 is to have 1 password (PIN) to protect the whole token. Secondary authentication on keys located on the same token has been completly left out of the protocol. As stated in the 2.01 specification :</p>

"48664342","IAIK PKCS#11 Wrapper: ECDH KeyAgreement Example","<p>I try to perform some ECDH key agreement, using the IAIK PKCS#11 wrapper (<a href=""https://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/sic/Products/Core_Crypto_Toolkits/PKCS_11_Wrapper"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/sic/Products/Core_Crypto_Toolkits/PKCS_11_Wrapper</a>), explizitly NOT using the JCE provider. So far I did not find any example how to do so, especially setting up the key template and mechanism (and mechanism-parameters). </p>

<p>Do you have some example, how to perform this and verify the result, optimally using BouncyCastle?</p>

<p>thank you!</p>
","<p>In the end, I made it work on my own. </p>

<p>First be aware, that the IAIK PKCS#11 wrapper does not support all key derivation functions of PKCS#11.
DHKeyDerivationParameters.KeyDerivationFunctionType specifies what it supports and sadly, although you 
provide a long, it checks if the value is known, so you can not simply provide the values defined for other KDF
functions. Still, if your PKCS#11-module supports it, you can use DHKeyDerivationParameters.KeyDerivationFunctionType.NULL
and do the derivation on your own. </p>

<p>For the following to snippets let session be some iaik.pkcs.pkcs11.Session, which is properly 
authenticated to use the selected ECDH key.</p>

<p>Do the following to derive a key, in this case for AES (2Des and 3DES or other AES lengths are mostly the same):</p>

<pre><code>final long CKA_VALUE_LEN = 0x00000161;

byte[] deriveKey(byte[] publicKey, byte[] salt, long keyDerivationFunction) throws Exception {
    // setting up mechanism:
    EcDH1KeyDerivationParameters params = new EcDH1KeyDerivationParameters(keyDerivationFunction, salt, publicKey);
    Mechanism mechanism = Mechanism.get(PKCS11Constants.CKM_ECDH1_DERIVE );
    mechanism.setParameters(params);

    // setting up keyTemplate, specifying how the derived key looks like:
    Key keyTemplate = new AESSecretKey();
    keyTemplate.putAttribute(CKA_VALUE_LEN, new Long(32));

    AESSecretKey derivedKey = ((AESSecretKey)session.deriveKey(mechanism, key, keyTemplate));
    return derivedKey.getValue().getByteArrayValue();
}
</code></pre>

<p>To retrieve the plain ECDH shared secret, proceed as follows:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] getSharedSecret(byte[] publicKey) throws Exception{
    // setting up mechanism:
    EcDH1KeyDerivationParameters params = new EcDH1KeyDerivationParameters(DHKeyDerivationParameters.KeyDerivationFunctionType.NULL, null, publicKey);
    Mechanism mechanism = Mechanism.get(PKCS11Constants.CKM_ECDH1_DERIVE );
    mechanism.setParameters(params);

    // four our PKCS#11 module, using a GenericSecretKey without length returns
    // the complete derived secret:
    Key keyTemplate = new GenericSecretKey();

    GenericSecretKey derivedKey = ((GenericSecretKey)session.deriveKey(mechanism, key, keyTemplate));
    return derivedKey.getValue().getByteArrayValue();
}
</code></pre>

<p>To perform the 'other' side and validate, that the derived value is as expected, you can use BouncyCastle and the following code:</p>

<pre><code>void testKeyDerivation(ECPublicKey otherPublic, byte[] salt) throws Exception{
    // create some keypair, which fits to the EC key, IAIK is using:        
    KeyPairGenerator keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""ECDH"", BouncyCastleProvider.PROVIDER_NAME);
    keyGen.initialize(otherPublic.getParams());
    KeyPair testKeyPair = keyGen.generateKeyPair();
    ECPublicKey publicTestKey = (ECPublicKey) testKeyPair.getPublic();

    // convert the JCE Publickey to the required format, using BouncyCastle:
    byte[] encodedPublicTestKey = EC5Util.convertPoint(publicTestKey.getParams(), publicTestKey.getW(),false).getEncoded(false);
    // format is 0x04 X Y where X and Y are byte[], containing the (padded) coordinates of the point, 
    // specifying the public key    


    // in fact, you need to do only one of these, but I want to show, how both works:
    byte[] iaikDerivedKey =  deriveKey(encodedPublicTestKey, salt, DHKeyDerivationParameters.KeyDerivationFunctionType.SHA1_KDF);
    byte[] iaikDerivedSecret =  getSharedSecret(encodedPublicTestKey);


    // verify that both sides indeed agree:
    KeyAgreement ka = KeyAgreement.getInstance(""ECDH"", BouncyCastleProvider.PROVIDER_NAME);
    ka.init(testKeyPair.getPrivate());
    ka.doPhase(otherPublic, true);
    byte [] secret = ka.generateSecret();

    Assert.assertTrue(Arrays.equals(iaikDerivedSecret,  secret));

    Digest digest = new SHA1Digest();
    KDF2BytesGenerator kdf = new KDF2BytesGenerator(digest);
    DerivationParameters derivationParameters = new KDFParameters(secret,salt);

    kdf.init(derivationParameters);
    byte[] derivedKey = new byte[iaikDerivedKey.length];
    kdf.generateBytes(derivedKey, 0, iaikDerivedKey.length);
    Assert.assertTrue(Arrays.equals(iaikDerivedKey,  derivedKey));
}
</code></pre>

<p>This does work for me with IAIK PKCS#11 Wrapper Version 1.5 and BouncyCastle Version 1.59, using my companies PKCS#11 Middleware and some Smartcard. I hope it also helps somebody else, trying to do the same.</p>

"42890583","Jarsigner - alias contains diacritic sign","<p>it's my first post here. I would like to ask for help.</p>

<p>I have a problem with signing .jar application. I don't know how to specify alias in jarsigner command, which contains diacritic sign.
 I have a Code Signing certificate. My alias (Pa Zówka) contains ó letter - Latin Small Letter O with Acute. 
I'm using JDK 8u121.
I've tried many combinantions, but every time I'm getting an error saying:</p>

<pre><code>jarsigner: key associated with &lt;my alias&gt;. not a private key
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried to convert my alias to Unicode:</p>

<pre><code>\u0050\u0061 \u007a\u00f3\u0077\u006b\u0061
</code></pre>

<p>or replace only this problematic letter:</p>

<pre><code>Pa Z\u00f3wka
</code></pre>

<p>I've changed code page for Windows Command Line between 65001, 852 and 1252. Still the same error.
This is my command:</p>

<pre><code>jarsigner -keystore NONE -certchain subca.pem -tsa ""http://server.time.pl"" -storetype PKCS11 -providerClass sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11 -providerArg ""provider.cfg"" ""fileToSign.jar"" ""Pa Z\u00f3wka""
</code></pre>

<p>Certificate is stored on smart card, that's why I'm using PKCS11 and -keystore NONE. Provider.cfg contains slot settings for smart card.</p>

<p>I have also the same certificate whitout any diacritic signs, stored on another card and it works correctly.</p>

<p>Any suggestions greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>If your supposition of an access to the token for any file is correct, then it would mean the hash of the files is also being calculated in the device, not only the signature.</p>

<p>Does your PKCS11 device have a logging option that could show which pkcs11 calls are the device receiving (hash operations are called C_Digest in PKCS11) to confirm?

<pre><code>static NettyChannelBuilder getChannel(final String host, final int port, 
  final File trustAnchorsFile) throws Exception{
  String configName = ""pkcs11.cfg""; // FIXME


  SunPKCS11 sunpkcs11 = new SunPKCS11(configName);

  KeyManagerFactory factory = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance(""NewSunX509"");  
  KeyStoreBuilderParameters param = new KeyStoreBuilderParameters(scBuilder);
  factory.init(param);
  SslContextBuilder builder = GrpcSslContexts.forClient(); 

  builder = builder.trustManager(trustAnchorsFile)
                 .keyManager(factory)
                 .clientAuth(ClientAuth.REQUIRE);

  return NettyChannelBuilder.forAddress(host, port).sslContext(builder.build());
}
</code></pre>

<p>testing that code I see, that it authenticates against the smart card (providing some wrong PIN (instead of the ""11111111"") decreases the corresponding retry counter on card. In addition, using a debug version of the pkcs11 dll, being used by the <strong>sun pkcs11 provider</strong>, I see, that the sun provider authenticates, lists all keys, reads all certificates and so (quite often), but does not try to perform some private key operation. In addition, providing <em>-Djava.security.debug=sunpkcs11</em>
to the JVM does not give any further inside (I stumbled accros that at <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15503514/ssl-client-authentication-with-smart-card-works-in-java-6-but-fails-in-java-7/15703794#15703794"">SSL Client Authentication with smart card works in Java 6 but fails in Java 7</a>). </p>

<p>Using wireshark to look into the TLS protocol handshake it looks like, the client tries to omit the client authentication part which makes the server closing the connection. This leads then to some exception on the client:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNAVAILABLE: Channel closed while
  performing protocol negotiation   at

  io.grpc.stub.ClientCalls.blockingUnaryCall(ClientCalls.java:141)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>providing the very same key and certificates from the smartcard as PEM files to the <code>SslContextBuilder</code> does result in a working connection, so I conclude, that the certificate(s) and the key itself do not form the problem, but maybe/probably some configuration of sunpkcs11?</p>

<p>Does anybody succeeded using gRPC with PKCS#15 smartcards / PKCS#11 tokens?

<p>What should be in native library to use it from Xades4J? Should this native library support some universally accepted interface. Maybe Xades4J is appropriate only for smart cards that are issued by Spain government?</p>
","<p>That is the driver that comes from the card provider.
To use your smart card, you need to install some software. That software (normally) has some nice interface but it also install drivers, (dll's for windows, so's for unix).</p>

<p>Going back to xades4j:</p>

<p>So, ""path/to/native/lib"" is correct...</p>

<p>In xades4j, see the test classes:</p>

<p>By the way, not xades4j, but interessing, for the Estonian card, <a href=""https://github.com/open-eid/digidoc4j/blob/master/test/org/digidoc4j/signers/PKCS11SignatureTokenTest.java"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">see this</a>: </p>

I found that I have to use java provider to pkcs11 to get certificate and private key from smartcard, but... it does not exists in jdk 7 (i'm using windows 7 64bit and I found info that pkcs11 is not supported in this version). 
And my question - any ideas how to do it in different way?</p>

<p>Sorry for my poor english... ;)</p>
","<p>If you are working on Windows platform and your smartcard comes with Microsoft CSP or Minidriver you can try to use it via sun.security.mscapi.SunMSCAPI provider.</p>

","<p>PKCS#11 objects can be classified by their lifetime and visibility as:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Token objects</strong> (those with <code>CKA_TOKEN</code> attribute set to <code>true</code>).<br>
They are visible to all applications connected to the token that have sufficient permission, and remain on the token even after the sessions (connections between an application and the token) are closed and the token is removed from its slot.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Session objects</strong> (those with <code>CKA_TOKEN</code> attribute set to <code>false</code>)<br>
They are more temporary - whenever a session is closed by any means, all session objects created by that session are automatically destroyed. In addition, session objects are only visible to the application which created them.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am not familiar with IAIK wrapper but it seems you are creating your key as a session object.</p>

<p>Summary: I am trying to find a solution equivalent to a SSL client side certificate, except that said certificate would optimally be generated at the first connection of the browser to the server.</p>

<p>Long version:
I want to automatically generate a security token using a PKCS#11 style authetication system so that when a user uses a certain login-code to a website, that computer can always connect to the user's page (without requiring a username).</p>

<p>I also cannot require PKCS#12 style certificates which require 5-10 steps to install in a client's browser, especially as that certificate installation may be locked down. The goal of this request is to explore the ability for a browser to provide authentic two-factor authentication in a seamless fashion. At present, it seems only sun is talking about PKCS#11 and browser support for client side certs is difficult to explain quickly.</p>

<p>As a caveat, talking about a browser-internal PKCS#11 may be incorrect, or may be a function of PKCS#15. I suspect I'm not asking the right question here. Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
","<p>You probably mean the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/En/HTML/HTML_Extensions/KEYGEN_Tag"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">KEYGEN tag</a> that generates a key pair on via browser and places the end result in some software store, as you want to generate software certificates on the fly.</p>

<p>Keygen has several problems and shortcomings, like you can't enforce a PIN/password policy and thus have the two-factor properties, and is in fact not a real standard and does not work everywhere.</p>

<p>PKCS#15 is totally out of topic here as it deals with a filesystem format on the smart card that is hidden way below the browser/https/crytpoapi layer.</p>

<p>PKCS#11 only matters with Firefox as IE and Safari both use native platform certificate stores and APIs (CryptoAPI and CDSA/Keychain respectively) internally.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I have two types of applet, one supports load of RSA private/public key to token and another not supports. It can only possible to identify if the token supports load of key is the response of transmitted APDU. So I can't take decision only to check the class attribute of C_CreateObject.</p>
","<p>If your library does not support <code>C_CreateObject</code> at all then the best choice IMO is <code>CKR_FUNCTION_NOT_SUPPORTED</code>.</p>

<p>Chapter 11 in <a href=""https://github.com/Pkcs11Interop/PKCS11-SPECS/tree/master/v2.20"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PKCS#11 v2.20</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Cryptoki library need not support every function in the Cryptoki API. However, even an unsupported function must have a ""stub"" in the library which simply returns the value <code>CKR_FUNCTION_NOT_SUPPORTED</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your library does support <code>C_CreateObject</code> for creation of other object types (e.g. certificates, data objects etc.) then the best choice IMO is <code>CKR_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_INVALID</code>.</p>

<p>Chapter 10.1.1 in <a href=""https://github.com/Pkcs11Interop/PKCS11-SPECS/tree/master/v2.20"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PKCS#11 v2.20</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the supplied template specifies an invalid value for a valid attribute, then the attempt should fail with the error code <code>CKR_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_INVALID</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>UPDATE</h3>

<p>Now that you have shared more details about your library in the comments I can add more detailed explanation:</p>

<p>It seems I can call your implementation of <code>C_CreateObject</code> with template containing <code>CKA_CLASS=CKO_CERTIFICATE</code> and it will  create certificate object on this particular token and return <code>CKR_OK</code>. If I call it with template containing <code>CKA_CLASS=CKO_PRIVATE_KEY</code> then your code will decide to return an error right after the evaluation of the supplied value of this attribute. IMO there is no doubt that chapter 10.1.1 of <a href=""https://github.com/Pkcs11Interop/PKCS11-SPECS/tree/master/v2.20"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PKCS#11 v2.20</a> recommends you to return <code>CKR_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_INVALID</code> in this case.</p>

<p>However if are not willing to follow behavior recommended by the specification and there is no predefined error code you like, you can introduce your own vendor defined code (see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/35807515/3325704"">my older answer</a> for more details):</p>

<pre><code>#define CKR_TOKEN_OPERATION_NOT_SUPPORTED (CKR_VENDOR_DEFINED|0x0000001)
</code></pre>

<p>IMO confusion level for inexperienced developer will be the same regardless of error code you return. In the end he/she will need to consult your documentation or logs produced by your library to find out the real reason why he/she received the error.</p>

If you take a certificate as a blob, you only need to care about the raw certificate data (AKA CKA_VALUE) and the subject of the certificate (CKA_SUBJECT).

<p>I don't want to import a certificate into a keystore with <code>keytool</code>. What I want, is to add a <code>java.security.cert.Certificate</code> object into a <code>java.security.KeyStore</code> object.</p>

<h1>Scenario</h1>

<p>My apps works with FireFox user certificates and those in a smartcard, with NSS + JSS. The APP first loads all user certificates via NSS and stores them into a <code>KeyStore</code> object, and stores their SN, DN, etc. Then, with <code>org.mozilla.jss.CryptoManager</code> I load all external modules, then every token of the modules, at last, with this line, I get a <code>CryptoStore</code> with all certificates of the token:</p>

<pre><code>CryptoStore store = null;
store = token.getCryptoStore();
org.mozilla.jss.crypto.X509Certificate[] certs = store.getCertificates();
</code></pre>

<p>Then, I read these certificates and store their SN, DN, etc., along with those data of user certificates, for UI part to show.</p>

<p>When doing an authentication, the user is prompted a dialog with all certificates to choose. This window has a table with rows containing <code>alias</code> of each certificate, users' + card. Then I pick the certificate from the <code>keyStore</code> with the selected <code>alias</code>.</p>

<h1>Error</h1>

<p>Here comes the problem: the <code>keyStore</code> only has entries of user certificates from FireFox, not those in the card. If I pick one from the card, and do this:</p>

<pre><code>certificate = keyStore.getCertificate(alias);
</code></pre>

<p>It returns <code>null</code>. It makes sense because those from the card are stored in <code>CryptoStore</code>. Now, if I do this:</p>

<pre><code>keyStore.setCertificateEntry(alias, cert); //cert is a certificate from card
</code></pre>

<p>no exception occurs. Then, when I do this again:</p>

<pre><code>certificate = keyStore.getCertificate(alias);
</code></pre>

<p>A <code>NullPointerException</code> from <code>sun.security.pkcs11.p11keyStore.P11KeyStore.getID()</code> happens.</p>

<p>this line is wrong, the value of CKO_DATA is 0x00000000, which means it is a 32bit integer, so the length of it is 4, and the value is an array of byte; and after some test, the value is a little endian sequence.</p>

But every time we call signature.sign(dsc); a window appear asking a password. It's possible to use the method sign and pass the PIN as param to avoid that window?</p>

<p>The method used to sign:</p>

<pre><code>XMLSignature signature = sig.newXMLSignature(si, ki); 
signature.sign(dsc);
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/loyqw.png"" alt=""Image that appear to input PIN""></p>
","<p>If you access a secure token through SUNMSCAPI with ""Windows-MY"" you are giving the authentication to the specific CSP vendor driver so you can not provide a PIN as method parameter. If you want to provide the PIN programatically you can access secure token directly with PKCS11Provider:</p>

<pre><code>// First configure the Sun PKCS#11 provider. It requires a stream (or file)
// containing the configuration parameters - ""name"" and ""library"".
String smartCardDriverPath = ""...lib\libpkcs11.so"";
String pkcs11ConfigSettings = ""name = SmartCardTest\n"" + ""library = "" + smartCardDriverPath;
byte[] pkcs11ConfigBytes = pkcs11ConfigSettings.getBytes();
final ByteArrayInputStream confStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(pkcs11ConfigBytes);

// instantiate provider
SunPKCS11 pkcs11 = pkcs11 = new SunPKCS11(confStream);
Security.addProvider(pkcs11);   

// generate the keystore and provide the password
char[] pwd = ""your_pass"".toCharArray(); 
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS11"",pkcs11);
ks.load(null, pwd); 
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can extract the Key from the keystore avoiding the password window input an use to achieve your signature.</p>

I would like to use a similar field in the which contains a string formatted value that can hold metadata information related to the key (like IV used to wrap the RSA key, date of generation of the key, etc). Is there a way to store these information in the existing pkcs11 template without tinkering with the attribute data structure in the implementation?

","<p>(AFAIK) vendor defined object types must be implemented inside the HSM unit firmware (in theory, the host-side cryptoki library could introduce some additional ""virtual"" object types, but this probably would not make any sense as the overall security model would stay the same -- because the host-side cryptoki code runs in an untrusted execution environment).</p>

<p>If you need more control than provided by the vanilla PKCS#11 you have some choices:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Use existing vendor extensions</strong> -- some vendors add their own extensions designed to solve common use-cases. Read your documentation or contact your vendor directly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement a custom firmware</strong> -- some products allow the end-user to run a custom code <em>inside</em> the HSM device. You can implement your model this way.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>SafeNet ProtectServer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SafeNet ProtectServer HSMs offer a unique level of flexibility for
  application developers to create their own firmware and execute it
  within the secure confines of the HSM. Known as functionality modules,
  the toolkits provide a comprehensive facility to develop and deploy
  custom firmware.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thales nShield:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most nShield HSMs also support the unique ability to host critical
  applications within the hardened security boundary, so you can
  establish tamper-resistant business processes in addition to
  protecting cryptographic operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Utimaco CryptoServer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The CryptoServer Software Development Kit (SDK) is the professional
  development environment for all Utimaco Hardware Security Modules. It
  enables integrators and end-users to create specific applications,
  e.g. proprietary algorithms, custom key derivation procedures or
  complex protocols that run in the tamper-proof environment of the
  CryptoServer Hardware Security Module. As the SDK provides full access
  to the Utimaco base firmware, custom firmware modules can be developed
  in a very short time frame.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong>Use some other technology</strong> -- do not use HSMs at all and leverage some other secure device. Specifically smartcards might be a viable alternative as some of them can be programmed (at least <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Card"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Java Card</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MULTOS"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MULTOS</a> ones).

<p>Now I'd like to do something similar, with EncFS. I wanted to store its xml config in a SmartCard. EncFS xml config has 1KB, so it fits, I can even store a few different config files in one SmartCard.</p>

<p>But EncFS doesn't support PKCS#11, as long as I was able to search for it. So, my idea would be to use the SmartCard as a very small and secure storage pendrive. Its readonly content would be mounted as a normal Windows drive letter, and EncFS would read its files.</p>

<p>Any idea how to achieve that?</p>
","<p>This is a very interesting task. PKCS#11 devices usually are capable of holding generic BLOBs, although the size of those blobs is severely limited (usually a few hundred bytes). BLOBs have short text labels, so you can treat them as files. </p>

<p>I know that this task can be accomplished fully user mode with our products (SecureBlackbox for PKCS#11 access and Callback File System to create a virtual drive) and maybe you will alternative options as well. I don't think you'd be able to access PKCS#11 from the pure kernel-mode driver because most PKCS#11 ""drivers"" are user-mode DLLs. </p>

<p>The only problem with this approach is that common PKCS#11 devices (smartcards, USB tokens) are very slow AND also they require that you login before providing any information. </p>

<p>Another possible problem is when exactly this file is needed to EncFS. If it's to be read after you login, that's ok. But if the file is to be read during system boot, then the task would become much more complicated (if possible at all -- that depends on what exactly stage of system booting the file is read by EncFS). </p>

<p>On the other hand, possibility to retrieve information without logging in to the device, is a kind of information leak, and as such possibility to obtain the list or the certificates themselves depends on the particular device. What works on your device might not work on other devices. </p>

","<p>PKCS#11 defines an application as a single process with single address space and one or multiple threads of control running in it.</p>

<p>Any application becomes a ""Cryptoki application"" by initializing PKCS#11 library in one of its threads with a call to <code>C_Initialize</code> function. After the library has been initialized, the application can call other functions of PKCS#11 API. When the application is done using PKCS#11 API, it finalizes PKCS#11 library with a call to <code>C_Finalize</code> function and ceases to be a ""Cryptoki application"". From application perspective, PKCS#11 library initialization and finalization are global events, so it is crucial to ensure that one thread does not finalize library while other threads are still working with it.</p>

<p>PKCS#11 function <code>C_Initialize</code> is called in constructor of <code>HighLevelAPI.Pkcs11</code> class and <code>C_Finalize</code> function is called when instance of <code>HighLevelAPI.Pkcs11</code> class is disposed. <strong>It is crucial to ensure that two instances of this class working with same PKCS#11 library do not overlap each other.</strong> My guess is that you are using more than one instance and you dispose it while you are still trying to use the other.</p>

"42587642","Verifying DSA Signature generated by PKCS#11 with OpenSSL","<p>I want to sign a SHA-256 hash with DSA using PKCS#11 Java Wrapper for the PKCS#11 API of a hardware security module. For this purpose I selected the Mechanism CKM_DSA, load the corresponding DSA key from the token and have the data (read as byte-array) signed. The key I use for testing has 1024bit length. </p>

<p>Everything seems to work fine: The key is loaded, the Session.sign() yields a byte[] array of length 40. This corresponds to the PKCS#11 Spec, which says:</p>

<p>""<em>For the purposes of this mechanism, a DSA signature is a 40-byte string, 
corresponding to the concatenation of the DSA values r and s, each represented most significant byte first.</em>""</p>

<p>Now I want to verify this signature using openSSL, i.e., using</p>

<pre><code>openssl dgst -d -sha256 -verify ${PUBLIC_KEY} -signature signature.der &lt;raw input file&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works if I </p>

<p>a) created the signature using OpenSSL</p>

<p>b) created the signature using bouncycastle and encoding the result as ASN1 encoded DER sequence.</p>

<p>Now I want to do the same with the PKCS#11 signature. My question is: how to format this 40 byte array? I tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>        //sign data
        byte[] signedData = this.pkcs11Session.sign(dataToSign);
        //convert result
        byte[] r = new byte[20];
        byte[] s = new byte[20];
        System.arraycopy(signedData, 0, r, 0, 20);
        System.arraycopy(signedData, 19, s, 0, 20);

        //encode result
        ASN1EncodableVector v = new ASN1EncodableVector();
        v.add(new ASN1Integer(r));
        v.add(new ASN1Integer(s));
        return new DERSequence(v).getEncoded(ASN1Encoding.DER);
</code></pre>

<p>The encoding part seems to be correct, because it works if I produce r and s directly with bouncycastle and another software key. Besides, openssl does accept the input format but the verification fails sometimes with an error, sometimes just with ""Verification failure"". </p>

<p>Thus, I assume the conversion of the PKCS#11 signature to r and s is wrong. Can someone help finding the mistake?</p>
","<p>You probably have to convert the <code>r</code> and <code>s</code> values to a <code>BigInteger</code> class before you do. The reason for this is that ASN.1 uses signed value encoding and DH results in unsigned value encoding. So you've got a pretty high chance of getting a negative value in your ASN.1, which will result in an error.</p>

<p>To perform the conversion, use <code>new BigInteger(1, r)</code> and <code>new BigInteger(1, s)</code> and put the result into the <code>ASN1Integer</code> instances. Here 1 indicates that the value needs to be converted to a positive value (i.e. the input is unsigned positive).</p>

<p>Wrong structure data starts from parameter <code>flags</code>, it MUST be 0 (Hex: <code>00 00 00 00</code>). But it has hex value <code>00 00 52 75</code>.</p>

<p>I can fix this error if I change type of parameter <code>flags</code> to <code>char[4]</code></p>

<p>What is wrong? Why is PKCS11 interface wrong for this structure?</p>
","<p>It is extremely important to remember, that according to PKCS#11 all structures are packed to the minimal size, supported by the platform, and not aligned to 4 or 8 bytes. Not doing this makes PKCS#11 drivers incompatible with applications. PKCS#11 standard is strict on this. </p>

<p>Testing Environment:</p>

<p>pkcs11 middleware: opensc</p>
","<p>More info about multi-threading and PKCS#11 libraries can be found in chapter 6.6.2 of PKCS#11 v2.20 specification:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>6.6.2 Applications and threads </p>
  
  <p>Some applications will access a Cryptoki library in a multi-threaded
  fashion. Cryptoki enables applications to provide information to
  libraries so that they can give appropriate support for
  multi-threading. In particular, when an application initializes a
  Cryptoki library with a call to C_Initialize, it can specify one of
  four possible multi-threading behaviors for the library:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>The application can specify that it will not be accessing the library concurrently from multiple threads, and so the library need
  not worry about performing any type of locking for the sake of
  thread-safety.</li>
  <li>The application can specify that it will be accessing the library concurrently from multiple threads, and the library must be able to
  use native operation system synchronization primitives to ensure
  proper thread-safe behavior.</li>
  <li>The application can specify that it will be accessing the library concurrently from multiple threads, and the library must use a set of
  application-supplied synchronization primitives to ensure proper
  thread-safe behavior.</li>
  <li>The application can specify that it will be accessing the library concurrently from multiple threads, and the library must use either
  the native operation system synchronization primitives or a set of
  application-supplied synchronization primitives to ensure proper
  thread-safe behavior.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>IMO the most commonly used type in multi-threaded apps is the 2nd type. To activate it you need to pass <code>CKF_OS_LOCKING_OK</code> flag to <code>C_Initialize</code> function. Following code shows how this can be achieved in C# with Pkcs11Interop library:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>Pkcs11 pkcs11 = new Pkcs11(libraryPath);

CK_C_INITIALIZE_ARGS initArgs = new CK_C_INITIALIZE_ARGS();
initArgs.Flags = CKF.CKF_OS_LOCKING_OK;

CKR rv = pkcs11.C_Initialize(initArgs);
if ((rv != CKR.CKR_OK) &amp;&amp; (rv != CKR.CKR_CRYPTOKI_ALREADY_INITIALIZED))
    throw new Pkcs11Exception(""C_Initialize"", rv);

","<p>The reality is that there are so many variants in PKCS#11 library behaviors working with HSM1 does not mean your application will work with HSM2, they just do so many oddball things you more-or-less need to test with each one. </p>

<p>With that said you can certainly get some confidence in your use of PKCS#11 by looking at other implementations.</p>

<p>Probably the cheapest way to get confidence your stuff will work with HSMs people actually use is using cloud offerings like those from Amazon (<a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/</a>).</p>

","<p>Encryption is about data, wrap about keys.
When you wrap a key, you <strong>export</strong> it <strong>encrypted</strong> under another key (symmetric or asymmetric key), which you specify in the wrap operation through a handle.
After the wrap, you don't get a handle, but the key itself (i.e. encoded data).</p>

I realise that <code>jcecsp</code> is not in the recognised app list of <code>--retarget</code> command.</p>

<p>So my questions is: is there a way to add <code>jcecsp</code> as an supported application for <code>generatekey --retarget</code> command? or this is simply not possible in nShield HSM?</p>

","<p>jcecsp is a little weird in that operations need to go through Java's KeyStore API.  You might be able to use Java keytool's -importkeystore option with SunPKCS11 as source, and nCipher.sworld as destination.  If this works, you'll have effectively retargeted the key.  The Java layer, working through the keystore file, ensures that key can be found again when JCE tries to access it.</p>

<p>You'll be dancing with a lot of options...

"34626585","How can I call a web applet method via JMeter","<p>I have a java web applet which tries to connect to a hardware token through PKCS#11 and sign a String. When the web page is loaded the sign applet is loaded either. When a dialog comes up in the web form, the user should insert the hardware token's password and after clicking the sign button, the web form call applet's sign method and sign the sending String via the certificate on the token. </p>

<p>Note that all these steps are executing on the dialog without any sending request to the server, so the JMeter can not sense what is happening until the signed text is sending through a request to the server to save in DB.</p>

<p>(The signed String is different each time and it's based on the different ID which is existed on the field of the web form)</p>

<p>The problem is how can I call the applet's sign method with JMeter because the signed String is based on the ID, It would be different in Load Test either. So The JMeter should not send a static signed String in each load and should sign the different String for every thread.</p>

<p>I tried to copy applet's jar file in the lib folder of JMeter and call Sign method via BSF Sampler but I get the PKCS#11 Exception in the line which I used <code>doPrivilaged</code> in applet's code. </p>

<p>Is there any help?</p>
","<p>I found the solution,</p>

<p>Because PKCS#11 is in package <code>sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11</code> we should use JDK1.7. </p>

<p>The problem was JMeter was not set to use the JDK7. So I edited JMeter.bat file and change </p>

"43749526","HSM via SunPKCS11 works on command line, fails in Tomcat-hosted webapp","<p>I have an application running under Tomcat 9, using JDK 1.8.0_111 as the runtime, on Windows 7 x64, that's trying to use a NitroKey HSM through the SunPKCS11 CSP and the OpenSC driver.</p>

<p>This works fine from the command line, including from a shell running under the same account as the Tomcat service uses.</p>

<p>Under Tomcat, however, the SunPKCS11 constructor throws a ProviderException with the message ""Initialization failed"". So far I've debugged this down to C_GetSlotInfo returning CKR_GENERAL_ERROR; that becomes a PKCS11Exception (with no further detail) and that gets wrapped in the ProviderException.</p>

<p>The slot number is correct - the NitroKey only has a single slot, so the number is 0. Besides the application itself, I have no problems using the HSM with keytool, OpenSSL, etc through PKCS#11. (Or through CAPI, for that matter.) It only fails under Tomcat.</p>

<p>Any ideas? Some other people have posted queries about this sort of failure if the HSM (or smart card) has been removed and re-inserted - see for example <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28603628/remove-and-insert-smartcard-using-sunpkcs11-and-tomcat"">remove and insert smartcard using sunpkcs#11 and tomcat</a> - but that's not the case here. The token hasn't been removed and remains accessible to everything else. But those questions imply that there's no inherent restriction on using SunPKCS11 and OpenSC under Tomcat.</p>

<p>I'm going to grab the JDK sources and debug further into C_GetSlotInfo, and try some other experiments such as spawning keytool with the appropriate options to see if it can talk to the card. But if anyone has any other suggestions I'd be glad to hear them.</p>

<p>In case anyone wants details: I'm invoking the SunPKCS11 constructor with a single argument, the path to the configuration file. It's reading the file successfully (I get a different exception if the file path is bogus or the file is unreadable). The file is very simple:</p>

<pre><code># PKCS#11 configuration file for Java to use NitroKey in slot 0 on Windows
name = NitroKey
library = c:/Windows/System32/opensc-pkcs11.dll
slotListIndex = 0
</code></pre>

<p>At the point of failure, SunPKCS11 hasn't seen any other details yet, such as the key container name or HSM PIN. Those would come later if the constructor didn't throw the exception.</p>

<ul>
<li>Module is available over RPC</li>
<li>Module has access to all HSM keys and services</li>
<li>Module has in-memory and persistent storage (1+ MB both)</li>
<li>Module memory is secured (FIPS 140-2 level 3+)</li>

<li>Retrieve public key and certificate with alias over the <em>PKCS11</em> interface</li>
<li>Delete keys with alias over the <em>PKCS11</em> interface</li>
</ul>

<p>As there is very little information available about HSM products due the NDA, it is very hard to evaluate the requirements and options. Are these requirement met by any standards, or by vendor specific solutions, such as <em>Utimaco</em>?</p>
","<p>If you really need to run custom code inside the HSM device you have several choices across several vendors:</p>

  complex protocols that run in the tamper-proof environment of the
  CryptoServer Hardware Security Module. As the SDK provides full access
  to the Utimaco base firmware, custom firmware modules can be developed
  in a very short time frame.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>My bet is that if you really need FIPS 140 certification you would need to certify your custom code running inside HSM as well (as such code is very powerful and can e.g. bypass access control, extract keys in plain text... -- thus it breaks any security assumptions easily).</p>

<hr>

<p>Your requirements should be fulfillable by any of the products (even <strong>without running custom code inside the HSM</strong> -- it depends on the level of control your application needs).</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>The problem is that after request generation i get CKR_USER_ANOTHER_ALREADY_LOGGED_IN error. I looked into engine_pkcs11 source code and in engine_pkcs11.c (https://github.com/OpenSC/engine_pkcs11/blob/master/src/engine_pkcs11.c) file there is a function called <code>static EVP_PKEY *pkcs11_load_key</code>. It's quite long so here is a part of it:</p>

<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>    /* Now login in with the (possibly NULL) pin */
    if (PKCS11_login(slot, 0, pin)) {
        /* Login failed, so free the PIN if present */
        if (pin != NULL) {
            OPENSSL_cleanse(pin, pin_length);
            free(pin);
            pin = NULL;
            pin_length = 0;
        }
        fail(""Login failed\n"");
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So, as i understand login is performed when key is used (PKCS#10 request generation requires key). If login is performed then i believe corresponding logout should be performed also, but i couldn't find. Here is source of ENGINE_finish() function:</p>

<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>int pkcs11_finish(ENGINE * engine)
{
    if (ctx) {
    PKCS11_CTX_unload(ctx);
    PKCS11_CTX_free(ctx);
    ctx = NULL;
}
if (pin != NULL) {
    OPENSSL_cleanse(pin, pin_length);
    free(pin);
    pin = NULL;
    pin_length = 0;
}
return 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible to somehow (maybe implicitly) make logout from security token on step 2)?</p>
","<p>Finally I could do it like this:</p>

<p>Before loading engine I open new session and login into it
After i finished working i close sessions (using closeSession() is not enough)</p>

<p>So request generation is done like this.</p>

<pre><code>    s = self.lib.openSession(self.slot, PyKCS11.CKF_RW_SESSION)
    s.login(user_pin)
    Engine.load_dynamic()
</code></pre>

<p>...
and i added after Engine cleanup</p>

<pre><code>    a.finish()
    Engine.cleanup()        
    s.logout()
    s.closeAllSessions()
</code></pre>

<p>I also had to do some patching to Session class in PyKCS11 source code because there is a typo (closeAllSession instead of closeAllSessions):</p>

<pre><code>def closeAllSessions(self):
    """"""
    C_CloseAllSessions
    """"""
    rv = self.lib.C_CloseAllSessions(self.slot)
    if rv != CKR_OK:
        raise PyKCS11Error(rv)
</code></pre>

<li>hwcrypto.js</li>
<li>graphene.js</li>

<p>Can anyone out there provide me further information or direction?</p>

<p>Thanks,

","<p>This answer aims at workarounds, rather than actual answers. </p>

<p>This is because there's <strong>no API in the browser at the moment</strong> you could use to obtain smart card certificate's private key and use it. This has been supposedly discussed in the Web Crypto API and as far as I remember - the consensus was this should not be supported for security reasons (which I stronly disagree!). </p>

<p>You, as hundreds or thousands other developers (us included), are out of luck.</p>

<p><strong>First workaround</strong> involves a .NET ClickOnce desktop app that is deployed at the server and run from the server. The app gets the security context of the current user session in runtime arguments so that the session is shared between the browser and the app that runs beside the browser. In this sense, running this app independently (without the session in the browser) would cause authorization issues during the communication with the server. </p>

<p>The app uses server's APIs to first retrieve the document user is about to sign. Then then app uses the local certificate store with no restrictions (as it's a regular desktop app), encrypts the document and sends it back to the server. </p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> ClickOnce apps can be invoked from within the browser.</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> this requires .NET runtime at the client.</p>

<p><strong>Second workaround</strong> involves a Java desktop app that is installed independently at the client's machine. You provide install packages for selected OSes (say Windows, Linux, MacOS), the user downloads the install package and installs the app in their OS.</p>

<p>Then, when the browser is supposed to sign a document, you provide an instruction that tells the user to run the app in the background. The app, when run, exposes an HTTP listener on a localhost and fixed port with <strong>two services</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>a push service that accepts the document data to be signed</li>
<li>a pull service that exposes the signed document, when it's available</li>
</ul>

<p>As you guess, it's the browser that does the request, the browser makes a request to the <code>localhost:port</code> and uploads the document data to the push service. The Java app switches from <em>waiting for the document</em> to <em>signing the document</em> state. The user is supposed to use the app - pick a cert from the store (no restrictions since is a regular Java desktop app) and sign the document. Your browser in the background <em>pings</em> the pull service of the app and when the data is ready, the browser downloads it. Then, the browser uploads the signed document to the actual server, using the actual authenticated session.</p>

<p>There's a potential security hole here, as any local app or any opened web page could ping the pull service and download the document (which of course you don't want). We are aware of two fixes to this.</p>

<p>First, you can have yet another service in the Java app that returns a one-time authentication token (a guid for example) that is meant to be read once and then supplied with every call to the pull service as an authentication token. If any other malicious app or webpage reads the token <em>before</em> your's app web page does, your page will get errors from the pull service (as the one-time token has been apparently stolen and was not available). The web page could signal a communication error here and warn the user of a potential security issue. </p>

<p>Second way to fix the hole involve an argument to the pull service call that is provided by the application server and put in the page's script as a value, a token signed by the server's certificate. Your Java app can have the public key of the server's certificate so that the Java app is able to verify the argument's signature. But no other app (and no other page) will be able to forge the token (as the token's signature's private key is only available at your server) and there's no easy way to steal the valid token from the page's body. </p>

<p>Pros: the Java app could possibly target multiple OSes
Cons: this still requires the Java runtime at the client</p>

<p>Both workarounds are tested in production and both work well for years. I hope this gives you one possible direction your final solution could be based on.</p>

","<p>@Json, you said ""it wasn't what I wanted to hear, but I'll accept your answer."" !!</p>

<p>I would suggest use of Browser Extensions for digitally signing pdf, file, or anything from modern browsers.  Browser extension will plug between browser providing JavaScript to browser connecting to extension host (application) running locally and accessing CertStore.</p>

<p>Our company has one such extension published and is free which uses .NET framework 3.5 which is generally available on all Windows clients. It does not use PKCS#11 simply eliminating need to provide PKCS#11 drivers etc and just works transparently once installed successfully. It uses Windows CertStore.</p>

<p>As per your comment, you have more clients running firefox, but we have Edge and Firefox extensions in development.</p>

<p>Setup (of host application running behind the chrome browser on windows) may be downloaded from <a href=""https://download.cnet.com/Signer-Digital-Chrome-Extension/3000-33362_4-78042540.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://download.cnet.com/Signer-Digital-Chrome-Extension/3000-33362_4-78042540.html</a>
Installing this host and restarting Chrome will automatically add Signer.Digital Chrome Extension</p>

<p>The actual working of this extension is illustrated <a href=""http://web.signer.digital/PdfSigning/Index"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a></p>

<p>Javascript to call method from extension:</p>

<pre><code>    //Calculate Sign for the Hash by Calling function from Extension SignerDigital
    SignerDigital.signPdfHash(hash, $(""#CertThumbPrint"").val(), ""SHA-256"")      //or ""SHA256""
     .then(
            function (signDataResp) {
              //Send signDataResp to Server
        },
            function (errmsg) {
                //Send errmsg to server or display the result in browser.
              }
     );
</code></pre>

<p>If success, returns Base64 encoded pkcs7 signature - use any suitable library to inject sign to pdf
If Failed, returns error msg starting with ""SDHost Error:""</p>

<p>I hope this helps!</p>

","<p><code>.ulTagBits=0</code> is very likely the issue. The tag size is the size of the <em>authentication tag</em>. You would not have an authenticated mode of encryption if you left it out. </p>

<p>Valid tag sizes of GCM are 128, 120, 112, 104 or 96 bits. Smaller tag sizes such as 64 bits may be acceptable by some API's. You are however strongly encouraged to keep to the 128 bit tag size, as the security of GCM strongly depends on it.</p>

<p>You may also want to specify either the IV len or the IV bits if the error doesn't go away.</p>

<p>The problem is when this happens, <em>the service isn't able to resume the communication when the connectivity is back, until I restart manually the service managing the HSM access</em>.</p>

<p>When the service starts, I call this:</p>

<pre><code>private Pkcs11 _pkcs11 = null;
private Slot _slot = null;
private Session _session = null;

    try

<p>When I have to use the HSM, I call something like:</p>

<pre><code>using (var LocalSession = _slot.OpenSession(SessionType.ReadOnly))
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>And, when I fail the communication due to a connectivity lack, I call a function to reset the connection and try to change the slot:</p>

<pre><code>private bool switching = false;

public async void SwitchSlot()
{
    try
    {
        if (!switching)
        {
            switching = true;

            {
                nSlot = 2;
            }
            else
            {
                nSlot = 0;
            }
            _session.Logout();
            _slot.CloseAllSessions();
            _pkcs11.Dispose();
            InitPkcs11();

        }
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But, this last snippet doens't work as expected: it tries to change the slot, but it fails always to communicate with the HSM (after a network down). If I restart the service manually (when the connectivity is back), it works like charms. So, I'm sure I'm doing something wrong in the <strong>SwitchSlot function</strong>, when I try to close the <em>_session</em> and open a new one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The PKCS#1 v1.5 RSA mechanism, denoted <code>CKM_RSA_PKCS</code>, is a
  multi-purpose mechanism based on the RSA public-key cryptosystem and
  the block formats initially defined in PKCS#1 v1.5.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>This mechanism can wrap and unwrap any secret key of appropriate
  length. Of course, a particular token may not be able to wrap/unwrap
  every appropriate-length <strong>secret key</strong> that it supports. For wrapping, 
  the ""input"" to the encryption operation is the value of the <code>CKA_VALUE</code> 
  attribute of the key that is wrapped; similarly for unwrapping.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>PKCS#11 specification uses term <strong>secret key</strong> only for symmetric keys. Moreover <code>CKA_VALUE</code> attribute is invalid for RSA private keys. This will not work.</p>

<p>Your best bet is to consolt the documentation of your device/library and choose different wrapping mechanism that suits your needs.</p>

<p>The main constraint is that I need to use a certificate on a smartcard...</p>

<p>I'm using dotnet core 2.1 for the moment.</p>

<p>First I did try to use dotnet core X509Store, but on MacOs I couln't access the PrivateKey object in any case (mandatory for XML signing.), then I discarded this lead.</p>

<p>Then I used pkcs11interop with the vendor-specific dlls to access the smartcard, and it worked well for XML signing (I wrapped pkcs11interop calls inside a RSA object, then I used this object as SigningKey inside SignedXml,) but it did not work for ClientCertificate connection.</p>

<p>Normally I use this method to connect to the server (dotnet framework 4.6.1, windows only) :</p>

<pre><code>HttpWebRequest req = WebRequest.Create(""https://sometlsserver.com/"") as HttpWebRequest;
req.ClientCertificates.Add(cert);
HttpWebResponse res = req.GetResponse() as HttpWebResponse;
using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(res.GetResponseStream(), new UTF8Encoding(false)))
{
    return sr.ReadToEnd();
}

<p>And the certificate is generated:</p>

<pre><code>var certAttr = session.GetAttributeValue(handle, new List&lt;CKA&gt;

    CKA.CKA_VALUE,

","<p><code>X509Certificate2</code> is legacy class designed only for Windows that currently has no widely usable alternative or sane multiplatform replacement.</p>

<p>When you construct <code>X509Certificate2</code> object using <code>byte[]</code> value of <code>CKA_VALUE</code> attribute you get just the certificate without the private key.</p>

<p>The closest you can get to "".NET compatible implementation"" is to implement class derived from <code>RSA</code> as I did in <a href=""https://github.com/Pkcs11Interop/Pkcs11Interop.X509Store/blob/0.2.0/src/Pkcs11Interop.X509Store/Pkcs11RsaProvider.cs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pkcs11Interop.X509Store</a> project. It will work with <code>SignedXML</code> class but as you already found out it won't be usable with most SSL classes that require <code>X509Certificate2</code> object with correctly associated <code>PrivateKey</code> property.</p>

<p>IMO you have three options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Switch to appropriate .NET Core version and create <code>X509Certificate2</code> object associated with your <code>RSA</code> implementation using <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.x509certificates.rsacertificateextensions.copywithprivatekey?view=netframework-4.8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>CopyWithPrivateKey</code> extension method</a> as pointed out by @FilipNavara in his comment.

","<p>Trying to access classes within package space <code>sun.*</code> from within a webapp inside a Servlet container is unsupported by the Servlet spec.</p>

"37293965","Support for PKCS11 on 64 bit JAVA","<p>Is there any way I can make 64 bit java support PKCS11 module?</p>

<p>PKCS11 module is supported on 32 bit Java and it also works fine. My signing process always runs out of memory when I use the 32 bit Java. I currently have 128gb ram so I would like to allocate more than 4gb for my signing process which isn't possible on 32 bit version.</p>
","<p>First of all, you should be looking at <em>why</em> the memory process is that intensive. It could be that you are able to factor out the hashing from the operation with the private key (padding, modular exponentiation, encoding). That the signing process takes so much memory indicates that something is wrong. It could be as simple as calling <code>Signature#update</code> instead of <code>Signature#doFinal</code> directly.</p>

<p>As for the 32 bit .dll, no you cannot just load that into a 64 bit application such as the JVM. For instance, take a look <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/2265023/589259"">here</a> to see that this would not work. There are of course ways around it; create a separate 64 bit process, connect to that using your own <code>SignatureSpi</code> class in your own Java provider (which requires to be signed using  a key provided by Oracle). Needless to say, that's a lot of work for fixing something that should just work.</p>

<p>It's of course a shame to go through all this trouble while you have a very high end system <strong>without a valid upgrade strategy</strong>, using a deprecated version of Java. You should focus on fixing that first. You should also wonder why you cannot get a 64 bit PKCS#11 <code>.dll</code> for your situation.</p>

","<p><code>SO_PATH</code> tells OpenSSL where to find the engine.</p>

<p><code>MODULE_PATH</code> is an engine-specific control that tells some engines where to find the module that they depend on. Basically, it's up to the engine to either execute the commands given it directly, or, in the case where third-party software is involved, pass them onto the third-party software, in which case the engine acts as a wrapper for the third-party module. It's up to the engine to figure out where this module is and load it, but some, like <a href=""https://github.com/OpenSC/libp11"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">libp11</a>, make this configurable through the <code>MODULE_PATH</code> control.</p>

<p>Anybody knows what could be the problem?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot, I will appreciate any help.</p>
","<p>I don't think there is anything wrong with the numbers returned. If you directly call the PKCS#11 module everything is fine. The number of available slots indicate the number of slots that <em>may</em> contain a token. As you can have any number of card readers, the number of slots is indeterminate. And you should not care, unless there is a token inside one of them.</p>

<p>It may be that you should not load the provider twice. You load it once directly in <code>getSlots</code>, then you let Sun PKCS#11 provider load it again. Otherwise, you should take a look at the Sun PKCS#11 logging to see why the <code>.dll</code> won't initialize. You can enable it by supplying <code>-Djava.security.debug=sunpkcs11,pkcs11</code> to your call to the VM/runtime (<code>java</code> or <code>javaw</code>).</p>

<p>I have posted this question here (even with bounty):
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13873666/pkcs11-sso-using-prior-windows-login-with-smartcard"">pkcs11 sso (using prior windows login with smartcard)</a></p>

<p>The same smartcard is used for windows login - and I would like to save the client the touble of re-logging using the smartcard (PIN).</p>

<p>Many links I have read about this issue led me to the world of SSO: NTLM, Kerberose etc.</p>

<p>I feel SSO is a bit an overspec for what I wanted to acheive - And also by the looks of it - At least kerberose requires me to create a KDC server and other new components that will elongate my development time.</p>

<p>So - some introductory questions about SSO I couldn't find an answer to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Will it actully solve the problem I presented? (The smartcards contain ""classic"" certificates signed by CA).</p></li>
<li><p>I would like a minimal solution (in terms of components) - which is the best implemnation for this? NTLM, Kerberose? I will probably have to use a jna wrapper like WAFFLE, right? By the way, I will use WINDOWS as OS.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you for your help.</p>
","<p>The only way is to set up a Windows Active Directory (a KDC impl) to use the full power of SSO with Kerberos. There is no other option. Don't use NTLM, it has a lot of drawbacks. Waffle has its drawbacks. Due its different nature, it does not integrate into JGSS and makes it unusable comprehensively in Java.
If you want to avoid licensing fees for Windows server, you may try Samba 4 which is an OSS alternative to the AD.</p>

<p>I am doing this for years in a corporate environment from Windows client to a Unix-based server.</p>

"56818371","What is the correct behavior of C_Decrypt in pkcs#11?","<p>I am using <code>C_Decrypt</code> with the <code>CKM_AES_CBC_PAD</code> mechanism. I know that my ciphertext which is 272 bytes long should actually decrypt to 256 bytes, which means a full block of padding was added.</p>

<p>I know that <a href=""http://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-base/v2.40/os/pkcs11-base-v2.40-os.html#_Toc416959738"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">according to the standard</a> when invoking <code>C_Decrypt</code> with a NULL output buffer the function may return an output length which is somewhat longer than the actual required length, in particular when padding is used this is understandable, as the function can't know how many padding bytes are in the final block without carrying out the actual decryption.</p>

<p>So the question is whether if I know that I should get exactly 256 bytes back, such as in the scenario I explained above, does it make sense that I am still getting a <code>CKR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL</code> error as a result, despite passing a 256 bytes buffer? (To make it clear: I am indicating that this is the length of the output buffer in the appropriate output buffer length parameter, see the parameters of <a href=""http://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-base/v2.40/os/pkcs11-base-v2.40-os.html#_Toc416959745"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C_Decrypt</a> to observe what  I mean)</p>

<p>I am encountering this behavior with a Safenet Luna device and am not sure what to make of it. Is it my code's fault for not querying for the length first by passing NULL in the output buffer, or is this a bug on the HSM/PKCS11 library side?</p>

<p>One more thing I should perhaps mention is that when I provide a 272 (256+16) bytes output buffer, the call succeeds and I am noticing that I am getting back my expected plaintext, <em>but also the padding block</em> which means 16 final bytes with the value 0x10. However, the output length is updated correctly to 256, <em>not</em> 272 - this also proves that I am not using CKM_AES_CBC instead of CKM_AES_CBC_PAD accidentally, which I suspected for a moment as well :)</p>
","<p>I have used <em>CKM.AES_CBC_PAD</em> padding mechanism with <em>C_Decrypt</em> in past. You have to make 2 calls to <em>C_Decrypt</em> <em>(1st ==> To get the size of the plain text, 2nd ==> Actual decryption)</em>. see the documentation <a href=""https://www.cryptsoft.com/pkcs11doc/v230/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> which talks about determining the length of the buffer needed to hold the plain-text. </p>

<p>Below is the step-by-step code to show the behavior of decryption:</p>

<pre><code>//Defining the decryption mechanism
CK_MECHANISM mechanism = new CK_MECHANISM(CKM.AES_CBC_PAD);

//Initialize to zero -&gt; variable to hold size of plain text
LongRef lRefDec = new LongRef();

// Get ready to decrypt 
CryptokiEx.C_DecryptInit(session_1, mechanism, key_handleId_in_hsm);

// Get the size of the plain text -&gt; 1st call to decrypt
CryptokiEx.C_Decrypt(session_1, your_cipher, your_cipher.length, null, lRefDec);

// Allocate space to the buffer to store plain text.  
byte[] clearText = new byte[(int)lRefDec.value];

// Actual decryption -&gt; 2nd call to decrypt
CryptokiEx.C_Decrypt(session_1, eFileCipher, eFileCipher.length, eFileInClear,lRefDec);
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes, decryption fails because your input encryption data was misleading (however, encryption is successful but corresponding decryption will fail) the decryption algorithm. So it is important not to send raw bytes directly to the encryption algorithm; rather encoding the input data with UTF-8/16 schema's preserves the data from getting misunderstood as network control bytes.  </p>

","<p>Okay, that indeed seems to be a (DER) OCTET STRING (tag 04, length 39 hex) containing a point in standard (X9.62/SEC1 et seq) uncompressed format (first octet 04) for a 28-octet (224-bit) curve. This seems silly to me, since all standard ASN.1 structures I know put a (point or other) pubkey in BIT STRING and include metadata, but apparently this is known or at least heard of because <code>asn1.x9.X9ECPoint</code> has a constructor for it. (For brevity and formatting, I omit the outer package <code>org.bouncycastle</code> that applies to everything.) </p>

<p>To use a point, you need to specify what curve it is on; I know of two 224-bit curves (more exactly, parameter sets) standardized by SECG and X9, secp224{k1,r1}, the latter of which (only) is adopted by NIST in FIPS 186-2+ as P-224, and two standardized by TeleTrusT as brainpool224{r1,t1}. Those are available built-in from <code>asn1.x9.ECNamedCurveTable</code> or <code>jce.ECNamedCurveTable</code> . There may be any number of nonstandard curves, which AFAICT you would have to create on your own. If you don't know what curve your uncompressed point is on, you can guess with effectively perfect accuracy by testing whether it satisfies the equations of candidate curves; I'm too lazy to do this for you. (A compressed point would be much harder to guess, perhaps impossible.) </p>

<p>Given the curve (from parameter set or direct) convert the DER to <code>ASN1OctetString</code> with <code>ASN1OctetString.getInstance(ASN1Primitive.fromByteArray(byte[]))</code> or just <code>ASN1OctetString.getInstance(Object/*byte[]*/)</code> which does the former for you, and then you can <a href=""https://www.bouncycastle.org/docs/docs1.5on/org/bouncycastle/asn1/x9/X9ECPoint.html#X9ECPoint-org.bouncycastle.math.ec.ECCurve-org.bouncycastle.asn1.ASN1OctetString-"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">directly construct an X9ECPoint</a> and depending on what APIs you want to use it with, either call <code>.getPoint</code> to convert to a <code>math.ec.ECPoint</code> or construct related (more complicated) structures like <code>crypto.params.ECPublicKeyParameters</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Added in response to comment since this is rather long, plus somewhat alters my answer:</p>

<p>I didn't realize you are using dotNET; my experience is with the Java version of Bouncy, and I'm impressed the two versions track closely enough your code even compiles. FWIW the Java equivalents of your revised code, with the one addition of explicitly building a <code>BCECPublicKey</code> from the parameters because JCE <code>Signature</code> takes only a <code>Key</code> type not a <code>Parameters</code> type, does work for me with a test keypair and data. You might try a similar exercise -- create a keypair and signature (for known data) in software and confirm if your code works for that case, then try to isolate the differences in the hardware-signed case. Although PKCS11 and other hardware devices are often designed to prevent device-generated keys from being exported to software, where they are presumably at greater risk of compromise, they are not always so strict on import -- you might be able to use your software-generated key in the hardware for comparison.</p>

<p>In addition to the generic reasons for any signature to not verify (wrong data, wrong hash -- which you apparently default, wrong key) another possibility <em>might</em> be the signature format. There are two commonly used formats (or encodings) for ECDSA (and DSA) signatures: either an ASN.1 SEQUENCE of INTEGERs in DER, or just the two integers in fixed binary format concatenated without any metadata. 'Standard' Java (more exactly, Java with the Sun/Oracle providers) uses only the ASN.1 format; Java with Bouncy defaults to ASN.1 but supports the fixed format for ECDSA if you change the algorithm name to <code>[hash]WITH{PLAIN,CVC}-ECDSA</code>, so I would expect Bouncy in dotNET (assuming your code is using it, though not explicitly stated) may do the same. I understand (but don't have personal experience) PKCS11 uses fixed format. If I feed Java Bouncy the wrong format it throws an exception rather than returning verify=false, but I don't know if dotNET could be different here. Look at your signature value in detail to check which format it is.</p>

","<p>Basically the Sun Provider implementation caches the <code>Provider</code> instance. Hence you are getting the instance in your application.

<p>Add a property to your provider instance <code>p</code>:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>And then finalize the <code>PKCS</code> provider manually before fetching the keys:</p>

<h2>Update #1:</h2>

<p>The Full log file for the hsid-pkcs11.dll is <a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b5t7aGfXd1YsvpO9do7QZraFRFW76Ejz"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a></p>

<h2>Update #2: (Solution!)</h2>

<p>After the remarkable comment from jariq, the HSID token doesn't like multiple calls to C_Decrypt, so I used his wrapper but instead of using the HighLevel library, I used the Lowlevel one and called C_Decrypt only once. And it worked!</p>

<p>Thanks to all of you.</p>
","<p>When executed with <code>--decrypt</code> argument <code>pkcs11-tool</code> calls (see <a href=""https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/blob/0.19.0/src/tools/pkcs11-tool.c#L1951-L1960"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source code</a>) following PKCS#11 functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>C_DecryptInit</code> to initialize operation</li>
<li><code>C_Decrypt</code> with allocated output buffer to receive the decrypted data</li>
</ul>

<p>Pkcs11Interop calls (see <a href=""https://github.com/Pkcs11Interop/Pkcs11Interop/blob/4.0.0/src/Pkcs11Interop/Pkcs11Interop/HighLevelAPI41/Session.cs#L854-L866"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source code</a>) following PKCS#11 functions in implementation of <code>session.Decrypt()</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>C_DecryptInit</code> to initialize operation</li>
<li><code>C_Decrypt</code> without allocated output buffer to determine length of decrypted data</li>
<li><code>C_Decrypt</code> with allocated output buffer to receive the decrypted data</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems that <code>hsid-pkcs11.dll</code> does not like it when application calls <code>C_Decrypt</code> twice as Pkcs11Interop does. However calling <code>C_Decrypt</code> twice is completely fine and this technique is described in chapter 11.2 of <a href=""https://github.com/Pkcs11Interop/PKCS11-SPECS/blob/master/v2.20/pkcs-11v2-20.pdf?raw=true"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PKCS#11 v2.20 specification</a>.</p>

<p>Exactly the same specification states on page 145 that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>C_Decrypt</code> uses the convention described in Section 11.2 on producing output.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IMO you need to contact vendor of your unmanaged PKCS#11 library and ask him for fix or at least explanation.</p>

","<p>(This answer was put together in the context of your other questions)</p>

<p>To read attributes of a PKCS#11 object <code>o</code> you can use the following code:</p>

<pre><code># List which attributes you want to read
attributeIds = [
    CKA_ENCRYPT,
    CKA_CLASS,
    CKA_DECRYPT,
    CKA_SIGN,
    CKA_VERIFY,
    CKA_ID,
    CKA_MODULUS,
    CKA_MODULUS_BITS,
    CKA_PUBLIC_EXPONENT,
    CKA_PRIVATE_EXPONENT
]

# Read them
attributeValues = session.getAttributeValue(o, attributeIds)

# Print them (variant 1 -- more readable)
for i in range(0,len(attributeIds)):
    attributeName = CKA[attributeIds[i]]
    print(""Attribute %s: %s"" % (attributeName, attributeValues[i]))

# Print them (variant 2 -- more consise)
for curAttrId, currAttrVale in zip(attributeIds,attributeValues):
    attributeName = CKA[curAttrId]
    print(""Attribute %s: %s"" % (attributeName, currAttrVale))

<ul>
<li><p>the <a href=""http://pkcs11wrap.sourceforge.net/api/PyKCS11.Session-class.html#getAttributeValue"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Session.getAttributeValue() method</a> method requires a list of attribute ids. You are constructing a list of ""lists containing <em>Attribute name (string)</em> and <em>Attribute id (int)</em>"" -- without any conversion -- this can't work</p></li>
<li><p>the <code>CKA_PRIVATE_EXPONENT</code> attribute is sensitive for RSA private keys. You probably won't be able to read it unless the <code>CKA_SENSITIVE</code> attribute is set to <code>False</code> (see e.g. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/14933297/5128464"">here</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>be sure to read only valid attributes for specific object (based on type, mechanism, sensitivity...)</p></li>
<li><p>the snippet above does not use the <code>PyKCS11.</code> prefix to reference PyKCS11 object members as it assumes they are imported with <code>from PyKCS11 import *</code> directive (I am not enough into python to tell you which way is the good one)</p></li>
<li><p>the attribute id &lt;-> attribute name mapping is based on fact, that the <code>PKCS11.CKA</code> dictionary contains both string keys with int values and int keys with string keys (you can dump this dictionary yourself or check the <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/PyKCS11/pykcs11/src/856b967cefb0e946d4b03614f71ddcaa9cbd8153/PyKCS11/__init__.py?at=1.3.2&amp;fileviewer=file-view-default#__init__.py-77"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source code</a>)</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remote Desktop redirection
  Notes about the redirection model:</p>
  
  <p>This scenario is a remote sign-in session on a computer with Remote
  Desktop Services. In the remote session (labeled as ""Client session""),
  the user runs <strong>net use /smartcard</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>Arrows represent the flow of the PIN after the user types the PIN at the command prompt until it reaches the user's smart card in a
  smart card reader that is connected to the Remote Desktop Connection
  (RDC) client computer.</p>
  
  <p>The authentication is performed by the LSA in session 0.</p>
  
  <p>The CryptoAPI processing is performed in the LSA (Lsass.exe). This is possible because RDP redirector (rdpdr.sys) allows per-session,
  rather than per-process, context.</p>
  
  <p>The WinScard and SCRedir components, which were separate modules in operating systems earlier than Windows Vista, are now included in
  one module. The ScHelper library is a CryptoAPI wrapper that is
  specific to the Kerberos protocol.</p>
  
  <p>The redirection decision is made on a per smart card context basis, based on the session of the thread that performs the
  SCardEstablishContext call.
  Changes to WinSCard.dll implementation were made in Windows Vista to improve smart card redirection.</p>

Also, the application is made by a client (desktop JAR executable) and a server part. The client has been developed only to interact with smart card that is connected to a USB reader, the rest happens on the web server.</p>

<p>From the legal point of view, both produce the same result.</p>

<p>My question is: from the <strong>techincal</strong> point of view, is it correct to state that when I sign a document with CAdES (RFC 5126, 140 pages I haven't been able to read all) the output file is the same both when I use a combined ""sign and timestamp"" function or use the two functions in sequence?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i2d_X509() encodes the structure pointed to by x into DER format. If
  out is not NULL is writes the DER encoded data to the buffer at *out,

<p>(Note that this snippet takes <code>i2d_X509()</code> as the example, but it works the same for <code>i2d_X509_REQ_INFO()</code>)</p>

<p>Before invoking the <code>i2d</code> function, you have to store the value of <code>tobesigned</code> so you can refer to it afterwards.</p>

<p>Recreating your example, it does seem to contain a valid DER-formatted representation of your structure, since it seems to go in the reverse direction without problems. This is illustrated by the following snippet:</p>

<pre><code>  unsigned char *ptr = tobesigned;
  int zzz = i2d_X509_REQ_INFO( req-&gt;req_info, &amp;ptr );
  const unsigned char *ptr2 = tobesigned;

  printf(""Result of i2d|d2i_X509_REQ_INFO: \n""

(Not to mention that this key is the raw shared secret, which should really be passed through a KDF/hash before being used as a cryptographic key).</p>

<p>I have a HSM, and I've generated a keypair for the sender - they're going to encrypt the message with their public key that I gave them, and I can decrypt the message using the private key I have in the HSM. </p>

<p>I'm going to then pass that message on by encrypting it with the public key of the ultimate receiver, which I have. </p>

<p>Is there any way to chain these two operations inside the HSM, without having the decrypted message anywhere near my application memory? I would like the plaintext content to never leave the boundaries of the HSM.</p>

<p>I know that some HSMs have a CodeSafe / SEE machine feature that lets me write embedded system code and run it inside the HSM, before I get into that I'd like to see if there's a way using the general PKCS / JCE / CNG APIs to do this safely.</p>

<p>This way the secret will never leave HSM.</p>

<li>create the object template with mandatory attributes such as <strong>CKA_CLASS</strong> etc. (<em>refer to the PKCS#11 specifications for details</em>)</li>
<li>set the <strong>CKA_TOKEN</strong> to <strong>TRUE</strong> if the object is to be persistent, or <strong>FALSE</strong> if it is a <strong>memory</strong> object</li>

<li>set a <strong>CKA_LABEL</strong> and <strong>CKA_APPLICATION</strong> attributes with values you want to help you find the object next time</li>

<p>Each of these Java processes creates the IAIK session and logs in:</p>

<pre><code>session = token.openSession(Token.SessionType.SERIAL_SESSION,
                    Token.SessionReadWriteBehavior.RW_SESSION, null, null);
session.login(Session.UserType.USER, XXXX);

<p>We were expecting that when a Java process updates the token (for example: adds the certificate, keys), the other java process would be able to see the changes as well( for example: <code>session.findObjectsInit(certTemplate)</code> would find the  certificate that was added by another Java process). </p>

<p>Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case. Once the session is opened and logged in, it seems to have captured the information of the token at the time.</p>

","<p>From looking at the IAIK's <code>Session</code> documentation <a href=""http://javadoc.iaik.tugraz.at/pkcs11_wrapper/current/iaik/pkcs/pkcs11/Session.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, looks like it doesn't provide an option to update/refresh the current session.</p>

<p>However, you can implement your own method that does the refresh for you. You can do it by closing the current session and logging back in with a new session.</p>

<p>however pkcs11-tool does not see the card:</p>

<pre><code>$ pkcs11-tool --module /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/opensc-pkcs11.so -L
Available slots:
Slot 0 (0x0): REINER SCT cyberJack RFID standard (9084002233) 00 00
  (empty)
</code></pre>

<p>What can be the cause of the problem? What do I miss?</p>
","<p>Apparently the toolchain of the estonian card is not compatible with pkcs-11. However the <code>chrome-token-signing</code> package contains the needed code at least for authentication to their service both for chromium and firefox, and the <code>qdigidoc4</code> package contains a tool to create and check signed/encrypted documents.
Their repo is here:</p>

<p>Another issue I have encountered that my cert is said to be invalid. That was because the certificate won't get enabled right away when you receive your ID.</p>

"53868043","What is CKA_VALUE used in AES secret key generation template?","<p>I am trying to integrate safenet HSM with our application. I am writing the program in C. I am referring to the <strong>PKCS11 v2.20 cryptoki</strong> standard document from RSA labs. I need to generate an AES 256 bit key. While defining the template for key generation I am not sure what value needs to be passed for CKA_VALUE. While generating a DES3 key, I didn't provide this attribute and I was able to generate a key.</p>

<p>I searched for sample programs for CKA_LABEL but failed to find any solid examples in C. I found a couple of Java programs where they have used CKA_VALUE_LEN instead of CKA_VALUE. I am not sure if that will work.</p>

<p>This is the snippet given in the document. Most websites give only this snippet as an example. Nothing is specified for the array value. </p>

<pre><code>CK_OBJECT_CLASS class = CKO_SECRET_KEY;
CK_KEY_TYPE keyType = CKK_AES;
CK_UTF8CHAR label[] = “An AES secret key object”;
CK_BYTE value[] = {...};
CK_BBOOL true = CK_TRUE;
CK_ATTRIBUTE template[] = {
{CKA_CLASS, &amp;class, sizeof(class)},
{CKA_KEY_TYPE, &amp;keyType, sizeof(keyType)},
{CKA_TOKEN, &amp;true, sizeof(true)},
{CKA_LABEL, label, sizeof(label)-1},
{CKA_ENCRYPT, &amp;true, sizeof(true)},
{CKA_VALUE, value, sizeof(value)}
};
</code></pre>
","<p>The <code>CKA_VALUE</code> is the actual value of the key. When you tell the HSM to generate a secret key, it will generate a key for you on the hardware based on the attributes you pass in secret key template, and set the value generated in the <code>CKA_VALUE</code>. This attribute however cannot be read/extracted nor it can be set when generating the key, because the HSM won't allow you to inject a key (directly) from the software nor allow you to extract it from the HSM (directly).</p>

<p>The <code>CKA_VALUE_LEN</code> is the length of the key you can tell the HSM to generate. The AES key can be of length 128, 192 or 256 bits. Depending on the key size you want you would set the <code>CKA_VALUE_LEN</code> as 16, 24 or 32 (key size as bytes).</p>

"47613646","How can I substitute my software application for an HSM to work with PKCS?","<p>I am trying to replace HSM(s) with my software-only application and integrate with PKCS11. The problem I have with that is all of PKCS api functions deal with slots and tokens which are not a part of my software application. Are there examples out there that I can look up to see how a software application can be used to imitate an HSM and integrate with PKCS ?</p>
","<p>When you are dealing with HSM's you have to deal with slots and tokens. You have to modify your software slightly to accommodate this.</p>

<p>There are 2 ways you can use the PKCS#11, <code>PKCS#11 Wrapper</code> or <code>PKCS#11 Provider</code>. The Wrapper is the api that calls the native functions of the HSM library (.dll or .so) directly. The Provider uses the Wrapper under the hood, but gives you the convenience of using it with Java <code>KeyStore</code> api.</p>

<p>Considering your case, the Wrapper might not be fit for you, because it involves writing new classes to integrate with the HSM. You could use the provider.</p>

<p>Java has very good documentation of the PKCS11 Provider <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. There is also a very good third-party library called <code>IAIK</code>, <a href=""https://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/sic/Products/Core_Crypto_Toolkits/PKCS_11_Provider"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> is their provider documentation. Even though you use the Provider in your software application, trivial code changes are inevitable.</p>

<p>Where ever you have used the <code>KeyStore</code> api, you may have to make changes there. And initially, when your software loads, you have to load a configuration file for the PKCS11 provider that tells which slot number and the token to connect to.</p>

<p>IAIK has very good examples too, and their provider library is only free for development purposes.</p>

<p>All of this is working fine using all of our tokens on several build servers.  However, I have one token that fails, depending on the mechanism being used.  From Java, using Jsign and the SunPKCS11 provider, everything works fine with this token.</p>

<p>However, from osslsigncode, signing fails with this token:</p>

<p>The difference between the working token and the non-working token is that the non-working token includes not just the certificate, but also its trust chain:</p>

Label:

</code></pre>

<p>My other tokens, all of which work fine, do not include these CA certs.  This token was created recently, so it may be that either the token firmware is different from my others, or the token installation process has changed since I created the other, working tokens.  The certificate is the same on all of them, working and non-working.</p>

<p>I've confirmed (via gdb) that the correct key ID is being passed into ENGINE_load_private_key.</p>

<p>I'm not sure who owns the ENGINE API in this case - is it a token driver issue?  (SafeNet)  Is it a problem with OpenSC? etc.  It would be helpful to find some other tool that uses the API in the same way so I could confirm whether the problem somehow lies with osslsigncode (which isn't actively supported) or one of the lower layers in this tower of cards.</p>

<p>P.S.  I used PKCS#11 Spy, and it shows enumeration of all of the certs in the chain, so it's finding the key pair (by ID), but then fails - no errors in PKCS#11 Spy - all CKR_OK.</p>

","<p>By returning <code>CKR_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_INVALID</code> your PKCS#11 library tells you that your template specifies an invalid value for a valid attribute(s).</p>

<p>Unfortunately PKCS#11 API does not provide details which attribute caused the error but many PKCS#11 libraries support some kind of internal logging mechanism which may reveal the real cause of error. Exact steps needed to enable logging should be present in the documentation provided by the PKCS#11 library vendor.</p>

","<p>It looks as if the problem is with your webserver providing the https.</p>

SHA-1 is disabled by default in the version of Firefox that you are using (52). MD5 is a worse hashing algorithm that SHA-1.</p>

<p>So presumably you should at least update the webserver. If you are desperate to keep using software that should have been binned, then I guess you there may still be a configuration option in Firefox, or use version 51, but I really wouldn't recommend it.</p>

<p>The second problem is that your unmanaged PKCS#11 library most likely does not support <code>CKM_PKCS5_PBKD2</code> mechanism at all because by returning <code>CKR_MECHANISM_INVALID</code> error your unmanaged PKCS#11 library is telling you that <em>""An invalid mechanism was specified to the cryptographic operation""</em>. You can use <code>GetMechanismInfo()</code> method to check whether the mechanism is supported:</p>

"20474902","How do you change from software to token client authentication?","<p>Hello and thanks for taking time to view my post.</p>

<p>I have a Client-Server suite with J2EE Applications on the server side and nothing but a browser (IE or Firefox) on the client side.  Currently I use x509 (PKCS#12) software certificates on the client for two-way authentication.</p>

<p>The server certificates are expiring at the end of the month, so I requested new certificates and received quite a surprise.  The new server certificate chain didn't match any part of my client certificates and are not interoperable.  After an in depth conversation with the Local Registration Authority (LRA) I found out that the network that these servers and the clients reside on are migrating away from software certificates and towards a hardware token (smart card).</p>

<p>I've spent the past few days scouring the web trying to figure out what it is that I need to do to change from PKCS#12 software certs to PKCS#11 token certs.  I have found a lot of information... actually too much information.  And that is my problem.</p>

<p>Pretty much all the information that I've found talks about the Common Access Card (CAC), and the token that I'll be using is very similar... but I haven't found any information that tells me how to make the client web browser prompt the user for a smart card instead of a software certificate.  I'm using WebLogic 12c servers and the server configuration is the same, regardless of what flavor of certificate I'm using.</p>

<p>I'm starting to suspect that it's the browser that makes the call as to what certificates to prompt for based upon certificates that it has 'seen' before.  I use my CAC to log onto several sites, but have never been prompted to use my CAC to log into my development servers.  The browsers only show me certificates that are compatible with the server certificate chain.</p>

<p>Is it possible that switching from software certificates to a smart card for client authentication is as simple as getting server certificates that are signed by the same Certificate Authority as the smart card?</p>

<p>This isn't something that I can just try... the process that I'd have to go through in order to get a server certificate signed by the same CA as my CAC is complex and I'd have to justify it.  It can be done, just not easily and I'm hoping for more information before I go that route.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any information you can provide.</p>

<p>v/r
Ace</p>
","<p>I decided to go ahead and climb the mountain of red tape and requested and received test server certificates, tokens, readers, token reader middleware, etc...</p>

<p>To answer my own question:  Yes, the act of changing out the server's certificate with one that contains a certificate signed by the same certificate authority chain causes the browser to prompt you for the token.</p>

<p>Note: You'll also need to install and configure whatever middleware that you need for the token reader... but you probably already knew that.  :)</p>

"48061087","PKCS 11 returns a wrong token info for my chip cards","<p>I have two smart card readers connected to my computer and each has a card plugged in. Using the PKCS 11 API I want to find out if the user PIN of the smarts cards is locked. According to the API <a href=""http://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-base/v2.40/os/pkcs11-base-v2.40-os.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation</a> we must retrieve an object of the struct <code>CK_TOKEN_INFO</code> which contains the <code>flags</code> field. There, the bit flag <code>CKF_SO_PIN_LOCKED</code> is set if the PIN is locked.</p>

<p>My problem is that the <code>flags</code> field does not change if I have a locked smart card and an unlocked one. I know that one of my two chip cards has a locked user PIN. I entered a wrong PIN 6 times and a program that we use to write on the smart cards tells me that the PIN is indeed locked. However the <code>flags</code> field is the same for both cards.</p>

<p>Here is a minimal program which demonstrates the issue:</p>

<pre><code>  #include &lt;iostream&gt;
  #include &lt;vector&gt;
  #include ""cm-pkcs11.h""

  unsigned long slotCount = 0ul;
  CK_RV result;

  std::vector&lt;CK_SLOT_ID&gt; vecSlotIds;

  int main() {

    result = C_Initialize(nullptr);

    result = C_GetSlotList(CK_TRUE, nullptr, &amp;slotCount);

    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Found "" &lt;&lt; slotCount &lt;&lt; "" slots"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;

    vecSlotIds.resize(slotCount);
    result = C_GetSlotList(CK_TRUE, vecSlotIds.data(), &amp;slotCount);

    for (const auto&amp; id : vecSlotIds) {
      CK_TOKEN_INFO tokenInfo = {};
      result = C_GetTokenInfo(id, &amp;tokenInfo);
      std::cout &lt;&lt; ""id: "" &lt;&lt; id &lt;&lt; "", flags: "" &lt;&lt; tokenInfo.flags &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>The output is:</p>

<p><code>Found 2 slots
id: 1, flags: 1037
id: 2, flags: 1037</code></p>

<p>As you can see, both <code>flags</code> are identical. Do I use the API incorrect here?</p>
","<p>I've tried the tool jariq mentioned in his comment and it seems the API implementation that we use has indeed a bug. You can see it in the image below. It says for both cards that they are not locked. But one of them is locked.

<p>Question: what can be the pkcs11 library file name? I guessed <code>opensc-hsm.so</code>, and defined PKCS11_MODULE to that path, but was not successful.
So, what can be the name of a pkcs11 library to be loaded?
Thanks</p>
","<p>According to this <a href=""https://python-pkcs11.readthedocs.io/en/latest/opensc.html#using-with-smartcard-hsm-nitrokey-hsm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pkcs11 page</a> on Nitrokey HSM, the standard OpenSC module can be used:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The OpenSC PKCS #11 module is opensc-pkcs11.so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternative is to use the HSM smart card vendor's module <code>libsc-hsm-pkcs11.so</code>:</p>

System.out.println(""deriveKey successful!"");        
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I am using a PKCS#11 wrapper (IAIK). The problem is the derivation generating different keys with the same derivation data. Is this an expected behaviour? </p>

<p>I think the derived keys are different each time because I am encrypting a known value with this key and the results are different every time:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] data = DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary(""01020304050607080C7D8B973D588B478000000000000000"");
Mechanism m = new Mechanism(PKCS11Constants.CKM_DES3_ECB);
session.encryptInit(m, deriveKey);
byte[] bytes;
bytes = session.encrypt(data);
System.out.println(DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(bytes));
</code></pre>

<p><strong>first run of key derivation and value encription</strong></p>

<pre><code>deriveKey successful!
encrypt using deriveKey: 7C4BB979F26FC78831CC83AB378E7B1D8E2F2D73B140D25D
</code></pre>

<p><strong>second run of key derivation and value encription</strong></p>

<pre><code>deriveKey successful!

<p><strong>third run of key derivation and value encription</strong></p>

<pre><code>deriveKey successful!
encrypt using deriveKey: A8D801BC1C0142B9E77576AEA0FBE677915E47144B6DCF3C
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I know the derivation is the encryption of data (derivation data) with a base key. This encrypted value is then converted to another key (derived key) and thus this value should be the same if the derivation data and base key are the same, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/32108274/2692914"">this answer</a> explain this steps.</p>
","<p>You should be using <code>CKM_DES3_ECB_ENCRYPT_DATA</code> instead of <code>CKM_DES3_ECB</code>.</p>

<p>It is strange that you are not getting an error as <code>CKM_DES3_ECB</code> should not be allowed for key derivation (see table 68 in PKCS#11 v2.40).</p>

<p>Your presumptions are correct -- this key derivation algorithm must give the same key for the same derivation data (and master key).</p>

<p>Good luck with your project!</p>

<hr>

<p>Just a note: Your example derivation data seem to have a fixed structure. This way (using DES in ECB mode) the third part of resulting DES key would be always the same (i.e. encryption of <code>8000000000000000</code>). You might want to hash the derivation data (e.g. with SHA-256) before it is used for key derivation. Or completely re-consider this algorithm.</p>

","<p>Check if CKA_MODIFIABLE is set to TRUE because this attribute indicates whether a Data Object is read-only or not. CKA_MODIFIABLE is by default TRUE and can only be changed by copying the object.</p>

<p>Also, pay attention to this note from the PKCS#11 standard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>attributes which Cryptoki specifies are modifiable may actually not be

","<p>I'm sorry, but I think this is just a shortcoming of the API. As encryption with the public key doesn't require any security, it doesn't make sense to implement it on the Yubikey. It is much faster to export the public key values and perform the encryption on the host.</p>

<p>To be fair, Yubikey could have been nice and implement the functionality in software within the Ubikey PKCS#11 library. If you really want to then you could create a new PKCS#11 ""wrapper"" library that <em>does</em> contain the missing functionality in software; all other commands that Yubikey <em>does</em> implement can be forwarded to the original Yubikey PKCS#11 library.</p>

","<p>After doing a rather extensive research and taking into consideration this thread's replies, I found that encryption not working in this token session is due to the OpenSC API limitation. As a matter of fact there is a <a href=""https://python-pkcs11.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#tested-compatibility"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">compatibility table</a> on the python-pkcs11 page that shows (in plain text) that OpenSC does not support Encryption, Symmetric keys generation, key wrapping and other functionalities. It does fully support signing/verification and partially supports decryption. Had I done a better search, it would've saved me a lot of time.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it is very useful to do a hard token test using 'pkcs11-tool', as it will show the supported functionalities and mechanisms for each PIV slot. In my case, I invoked it as follows: </p>

<pre><code>pkcs11-tool -p $pin -t

<p>From there, we can see that decryption is supported for all three occupied slots but only with RSA-X-509 and RSA-PKCS mechanisms (no OAEP). </p>

<p>Now, I am considering fusing the pkcs11-tool and openssl functionalities to do data encryption. I haven't figured out all the intricacies of this kind of flow, but I am thinking something of <a href=""https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/Using-pkcs11-tool-and-OpenSSL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this sort</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>(pkcs11-tool) Export a certificate from a desired PIV slot</li>
<li>(openssl) Create a symmetric (e.g., AES) secret key</li>
<li>(openssl) Encrypt the data with this secret key</li>
<li>(openssl) Use the certificate from step 1 to encrypt the secret key </li>
<li>Send the [symmetrically] encrypted data and [asymmetrically] encrypted secret key to the recipient</li>
<li>(pkcs11-tool) Decrypt the secret key on the secure token</li>
<li>(openssl) Use the decrypted secret key to decrypt the actual data</li>
</ol>

<p>It looks like I should be able to implement such a workaround either in Linux shell using <em>pkcs11-tool</em> and <em>openssl</em> utilities or in Python using <em>pkcs11</em> and <em>OpenSSL</em> libraries. The latter seems more preferable if I decide to later do it through GUI. This all seems quite low level, so I am wondering if there is a easier way to encrypt/decrypt data. I know that PGP fuses the encrypted data and wrapped secret key together into one single file, so the end-users only have to execute one command on their end. </p>

The vendor does not provide any PKCS#11 module, so I would like to use OpenSC (the card is not listed as compatible with OpenSC).</p>

<p>As far as I know, the scenario should be this:</p>

<ol>
<li>The software on the computer uses PKCS#11 APIs implemented by OpenSC.</li>
<li>OpenSC works together with PC/SC in order to build and send APDUs to the card.</li>
<li>The card processes the command APDUs and replies with response APDUs.</li>

","<blockquote>
  <p>the fact that OpenSC is not compatible with all smart cards makes me think that it uses proprietary commands</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, not really, it's rather the other way around. ISO 7816-4 lists many commands for file or record based smart cards. There are few if any cards that <em>fully</em> implement all the commands written in ISO 7816-4. Furthermore, even if they did, there are many gaps in the standard, such as not clearly describing error conditions, multiple options with regards even to what is at the ""root"" of the file system, proprietary parameters, proprietary commands, no clear secure messaging etc. etc. etc..</p>

<p>In that sense it is a horrible standard; you should see it as a poor attempt of the industry of file system card manufacturers to create something that they can all adhere to.</p>

<hr>

<p>Supporting 7816-4 furthermore doesn't mean that any specific use case is supported. There are no descriptions on how you get to a signature. There is at least PKCS#15 (also reflected now as an ISO standard) which specifies where files and keys can be found. However, if you create a signature you also have to know what kind of signature is created and which command should be used to do that.</p>

<p>In other words, generally ""middleware"" such as OpenSC always has to do some stuff to support specific cards. That one card is not supported doesn't say that OpenSC is ""wrong"" in any way, it just means that support for the card - if it <em>is</em> indeed a file system card or programmable card - was not yet tested / implemented.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that PC/SC is just a standardized way of handling smart cards from within an operating system (starting with the Windows OS from which it originated). Those commands just have to have to comply with ISO 7816-4, but it doesn't care at all <em>what kind of commands are send or in which order</em>. There aren't any PC/SC compatible smart cards out there, there are only <em>compatible readers</em> (or, as they can not just read, smart card interface devices or IFD's) for ISO 7816-4 compatible smart cards.</p>

<p>Some hardware tokens may also be PC/SC compatible, simply because they emulate a combination of reader and chip or because they internally <em>are</em> a reader and chip (the cheaper / slower ones). Others work on a higher level and use PKCS#11 which defines an interface for cryptographic tokens directly and is arguably and objectively better defined than ISO 7816-4 or -15 combined.</p>

"44115330","Use MS Virtual Smartcards as keystore on server","<p>I'm currently trying to find a possibility to store priv. keys on a server in a secure way on hardware. Basically it is a requirement, that keys on a critical server are to be stored on secure hardware. The ""classical"" approach for this is to use a HSM, but since very few servers in different projects need to be secured that way, alwas buying a HSM is too expensive. </p>

<p>So my idea was to use windows virtual smartcards to store the server keys and the software running on the server should use PKCS#11 to talk to this smartcard.</p>

<p>Is it possible to use virtual smartcards to store priv. keys for server applications and is there a possibility to use virtual smartcards without the necessity to enter the pin all the time? Afaik there is a possibility to encrypt a server with bitlocker but get the ""key"" at startup from the AD, maybe something the like is possible with virtual smartcards.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot</p>

"54923803","PKCS#11 - How to protect smartcard owner, from malicious smartcard provider when writing new certificates on an already provisioned smartcard","<p>I am currently learning PKCS#11 and there is a certain scenario that I don't know how to deal with. </p>

<p>This is the scenario:</p>

<ul>
<li>A client who would like to acquire certificates from a provider enters his data,</li>
<li>A client comes to a provider facility, where he can acquire ordered smartcard, with certificates (qualified, and commercial for example) written on it,</li>
<li>Two things have to happen with the smartcard: provider has to generate key pair for both certificates, and then write a certificate on card (which requires User PIN)</li>
</ul>

<p>Smartcards, as far as I know have two types of user: normal user (User PIN), and SO (SO PIN).</p>

<p>So what is the problem? When provider uses the User PIN for generating keys, and writing certificates, we can change it programatically with SetPin interop operation, or let client change it later in home, with appropriate software. Problem occurs, when a client would want to acquire new certificates for his smart card, and at this stage, provider doesn't know the User PIN for the card (i.e. he is not able to use any cryptographic mechanisms on the card). If the client would provide the password for the providing person, he would be able to make the client sign some random documents with his certificates, instead of using the PIN for the right cause (utilizing PKCS#11 mechanisms for writing a new certificate)</p>

<p>So my question is:</p>

<p>Is there any way that we can have a second User PIN on the card (separate for provider, and client) for certain tokens? Can we make some PKCS#11 mechanisms available only to specific user (for example generating key pair only for provider, and signing documents with certificates only for the client)?</p>

<p>What would be standarized scenario for dealing with this kind of problem? I would be glad to hear your opinions.</p>
","<p>While you correctly describe user and SO-PINs, real cards may have significantly more PINs, and other authentication methods as well such as biometric authentications and challenge response tests (proving knowledge of a secret symmetric key). </p>

<p>For an authentication against a system the PIN mechanism is inappropriate (can be attacked via replay) and challenge-response is the typical solution. This also has the advantage, that it will not allow to perform a signature.</p>

<p>Another option (if the key can only be generated once) would be via the life cycle of the certificate file. An un-initialized file may not require an authentication at all and only after writing the certificate the life cycle of the file is changed.</p>

<p>One can also re-order the complete process, so the User-PIN is not yet valid and therefore no signature can be created at the time of certificate writing. Only afterwards the user chooses a PIN value and establishes that.</p>

But somehow my supervisor insists there is somewhere inside the smart card that contains the information on the maximum number of tries to enter the PIN. </p>

<p>Is it really somewhere in there?</p>
","<p>Of course: each PIN object in the card has a respective error counter. Otherwise one could not ensure, that the PIN really blocks after the given number of erroneous attempts, as soon as several clients are involved.</p>

<p>(PKCS is simply an additional layer for translating generic commands into the the special ones for the corresponding card type.)</p>

<p>The problem is, that there are few to none ways to extract that error counter in a standardized way. This depends one the card type and its configuration. The best chance is to send a <code>VERIFY</code> command with wrong PIN data and look for a '63 Cn' status code, where n represents the number of attempts remaining. In worst case, however, the card responds with '63 00' if there is one or more attempt remaining  and '69 83' if the PIN is blocked. For details you have to refer to the smart card operating system manual.</p>

<p>I’m able to do all required crypto operations for my project using <code>python-pkcs11</code> package such as AES encryption, HMAC signing, RSA signing, and etc. However, I couldn’t find a way to “bind” pkcs11 to any TLS library. What I mean is a “Pythonic” way of calling a function that handles pkcs11 layer and establishes a TLS channel. Requests does not support pkcs11. <code>libcurl</code> has support for pkcs11 but it’s not implemented in <code>pycurl</code>, neither <code>pyopenssl</code>. </p>

<p>I’m able to do it openssl’s s_client CLI tool using engine api:</p>

<p>I have read that if openssl, libp11, and python are compiled in such a way it is possible to abstract all of this, hence simple requests calls would go through HSM, transparent to application code. Although, I couldn’t find any material on how to do it.</p>

"57053714","Why sign method returns only four bytes?","<p>I am trying to implement pkcs 11 standard using pkcs11interop</p>

<p>I have some des2 keys (16 byte) and i want use sign method</p>

<p>my problem is that sign method returns only four bytes. but I want 8 byte sign.</p>

<p>what should i do?</p>

<p>PS 1: the four byte result is correct. that is first bytes of my expected result.</p>

<p>PS 2: I know sign method is same as encrypt method. so one of my solutions is that encrypt input and get first 8 bytes of result (that is what i am already doing). but I feel bad about it and I think it is better to use Sign method itself.</p>

<p>PS 3: there is a ""ICkMacGeneralParams"" interface that can be use to select MAC size. but seems to doesnt effect AT ALL! i set it to UInt32.MaxValue and 0 and result was not different.</p>

<p>PS 4: I know Sign method usually used with public and private keys. but I need to use it with one key</p>

<pre><code>        var data = new byte[] { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, };

        //macParams seems not to work at all! result remains same with any input of CreateCkMacGeneralParams method
        var macParams = session.Factories.MechanismParamsFactory.CreateCkMacGeneralParams(8);

        var signMechanism = session.Factories.MechanismFactory.Create(CKM.CKM_DES3_MAC, macParams);
        //handle references to some 16 byte key with CKK_DES2
        var signResult = session.Sign(signMechanism, handle, data);
        //result is always 4 bytes
</code></pre>
","<p>Mechanism <code>CKM_DES3_MAC</code> always gives 4 bytes of output for DES, citing ""PKCS #11 v2.20"", section 12.13.14:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It always produces an output of size half as large as &lt;NAME&gt;’s blocksize.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to use <code>CKM_DES3_MAC_GENERAL</code> which allows signature lengths up to DES blocksize (see section 12.13.13). Desired signature length is specified in mechanism parameter <code>CK_MAC_GENERAL_PARAMS</code>.</p>

<p>If your token supports this mechanism the following code should work:</p>

<pre><code>var data = new byte[] { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 };

var macParams = session.Factories.MechanismParamsFactory.CreateCkMacGeneralParams(8);
var signMechanism = session.Factories.MechanismFactory.Create(CKM.CKM_DES3_MAC_GENERAL, macParams);
    var signResult = session.Sign(signMechanism, handle, data);
