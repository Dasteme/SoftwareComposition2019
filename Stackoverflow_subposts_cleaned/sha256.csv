","Encoding.Unicode is Microsoft's misleading name for UTF-16 (a double-wide encoding, used in the Windows world for historical reasons but not used by anyone else). http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.encoding.unicode.aspx
If you inspect your bytes array, you'll see that every second byte is 0x00 (because of the double-wide encoding).
You should be using Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes instead.
But also, you will see different results depending on whether or not you consider the terminating '\0' byte to be part of the data you're hashing. Hashing the two bytes ""Hi"" will give a different result from hashing the three bytes ""Hi"". You'll have to decide which you want to do. (Presumably you want to do whichever one your friend's PHP code is doing.)
For ASCII text, Encoding.UTF8 will definitely be suitable. If you're aiming for perfect compatibility with your friend's code, even on non-ASCII inputs, you'd better try a few test cases with non-ASCII characters such as é and 家 and see whether your results still match up. If not, you'll have to figure out what encoding your friend is really using; it might be one of the 8-bit ""code pages"" that used to be popular before the invention of Unicode. (Again, I think Windows is the main reason that anyone still needs to worry about ""code pages"".)

","Neither. You should use bcrypt. The hashes you mention are all optimized to be quick and easy on hardware, and so cracking them share the same qualities. If you have no other choice, at least be sure to use a long salt and re-hash multiple times.
Using bcrypt in PHP 5.5+
PHP 5.5 offers new functions for password hashing. This is the recommend approach for password storage in modern web applications.
// Creating a hash
$hash = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT, ['cost' => 12]);
// If you omit the ['cost' => 12] part, it will default to 10

// Verifying the password against the stored hash  
if (password_verify($password, $hash)) {
    // Success! Log the user in here.
}

If you're using an older version of PHP you really should upgrade, but until you do you can use password_compat to expose this API.
Also, please let password_hash() generate the salt for you. It uses a [CSPRNG](http://
Two caveats of bcrypt

Bcrypt will silently truncate any password longer than 72 characters.
Bcrypt will truncate after any NUL characters.

(Proof of Concept for both caveats here.)
You might be tempted to resolve the first caveat by pre-hashing your passwords before running them through bcrypt, but doing so can cause your application to run headfirst into the second. 
Instead of writing your own scheme, use an existing library written and/or evaluated by security experts.

Zend\Crypt (part of Zend Framework) offers BcryptSha
PasswordLock is similar to BcryptSha but it also encrypts the bcrypt hashes with an authenticated encryption library.

TL;DR - Use bcrypt.

Important Edit:
Moving forward please use bcrypt as a hardened hash. More information can be found here.

Use a random number, or random byte stream etc. You can use the unique field of the record in your database as the salt too, this way the salt is different per user.

","As Johannes Gorset pointed out, the post by Thomas Ptacek from Matasano Security explains why simple, general-purpose hashing functions such as MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512 are poor password hashing choices.
Why? They are too fast--you can calculate at least 1,000,000 MD5 hashes a second per core with a modern computer, so brute force is feasible against most passwords people use. And that's much less than a GPU-based cracking server cluster!
Salting without key stretching only means that you cannot precompute the rainbow table, you need to build it ad hoc for that specific salt. But it won't really make things that much harder.
User @Will says:

Everyone is talking about this like they can be hacked over the
  internet. As already stated, limiting attempts makes it impossible to
  crack a password over the Internet and has nothing to do with the
  hash.

They don't need to. Apparently, in the case of LinkedIn they used the common SQL injection vulnerability to get the login DB table and cracked millions of passwords offline.
Then he goes back to the offline attack scenario:

The security really comes into play when the entire database is
  compromised and a hacker can then perform 100 million password
  attempts per second against the md5 hash. SHA512 is about 10,000 times
  slower.

No, SHA512 is not 10000 times slower than MD5--it only takes about twice as much. Crypt/SHA512, on the other hand, is a very different beast that, like its BCrypt counterpart, performs key stretching, producing a very different hash with a random salt built-in and will take anything between 500 and 999999 times as much to compute (stretching is tunable).
SHA512 => aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabede0f3b482cd9aea9434d

The salt is a must, but the complexity or multiple salts doesn't even matter.  Any salt alone stops the attacker from using a premade rainbow table.  A unique salt per user stops the attacker from creating a new rainbow table to use against your entire user base.
The security really comes into play when the entire database is compromised and a hacker can then perform 100 million password attempts per second against the md5 hash.  SHA512 is about 10,000 times slower.  A complex password with today's power could still take 100 years to bruteforce with md5 and would take 10,000 times as long with SHA512.  The salts don't stop a bruteforce at all as they always have to be known, which if the attacker downloaded your database, he probably was in your system anyway.

","I think using md5 or sha256 or any hash optimized for speed is perfectly fine and am very curious to hear any rebuttle other users might have.  Here are my reasons

If you allow users to use weak passwords such as God, love, war, peace then no matter the encryption you will still be allowing the user to type in the password not the hash and these passwords are often used first, thus this is NOT going to have anything to do with encryption.
If your not using SSL or do not have a certificate then attackers listening to the traffic will be able to pull the password and any attempts at encrypting with javascript or the like is client side and easily cracked and overcome.  Again this is NOT going to have anything to do with data encryption on server side.
Brute force attacks will take advantage weak passwords and again because you allow the user to enter the data if you do not have the login limitation of 3 or even a little more then the problem will again NOT have anything to do with data encryption.
If your database becomes compromised then most likely everything has been compromised including your hashing techniques no matter how cryptic you've made it.  Again this could be a disgruntled employee XSS attack or sql injection or some other attack that has nothing to do with your password encryption.

I do believe you should still encrypt but the only thing I can see the encryption does is prevent people that already have or somehow gained access to the database from just reading out loud the password.  If it is someone unauthorized to on the database then you have bigger issues to worry about that's why Sony got took because they thought an encrypted password protected everything including credit card numbers all it does is protect that one field that's it.
The only pure benefit I can see to complex encryptions of passwords in a database is to delay employees or other people that have access to the database from just reading out the passwords.  So if it's a small project or something I wouldn't worry to much about security on the server side instead I would worry more about securing anything a client might send to the server such as sql injection, XSS attacks or the plethora of other ways you could be compromised.  If someone disagrees I look forward to reading a way that a super encrypted password is a must from the client side.
The reason I wanted to try and make this clear is because too often people believe an encrypted password means they don't have to worry about it being compromised and they quit worrying about securing the website.

","MD5 is bad because of collision problems - two different passwords possibly generating the same md-5.
Sha-1 would be plenty secure for this. The reason you store the salted sha-1 version of the password is so that you the swerver do not keep the user's apassword on file, that they may be using with other people's servers. Otherwise, what difference does it make? 
If the hacker steals your entire unencrypted database some how, the only thing a hashed salted password does is prevent him from impersonating the user for future signons - the hacker already has the data.
What good does it do the attacker to have the hashed value, if what your user inputs is a plain password? 
And even if the hacker with future technology could generate a million sha-1 keys a second for a brute force attack, would your server handle a million logons a second for the hacker to test his keys?  That's if you are letting the hacker try to logon with the salted sha-1 instead of a password like a normal logon.
The best bet is to limit bad logon attempts to some reasonable number - 25 for example, and then time the user out for a minute or two. And if the cumulative bady logon attempts hits 250 within 24 hours, shut the account access down and email the owner.

","What people seem to be missing is that if the hacker has access to the database he probably also has access to the php file that hashes the password and can likely just modify that to send him all the successful user name password combos.  If he doesn't have access to the web directory he could always just pick a password hash it, and write that into the database.  In other words the hash algorithm doesn't really matter as much as system security, and limiting login attempts also if you don't use SSL then the attacker can just listen in on the connection to get the information. Unless you need the algorithm to take a long time to compute (for your own purposes) then SHA-256 or SHA-512 with a user specific salt should be enough.
As an added security measure set up a script (bash, batch, python, etc) or program and give it an obscure name and have it check and see if login.php has changed (check date/time stamp) and send you an email if it has. Also should probably log all attempts at login with admin rights and log all failed attempts to log into the database and have the logs emailed to you.

","Use argon2i. The argon2 password hashing function has won the Password Hashing Competition.

MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 are message digests, not password-hashing functions. They are not suitable for this purpose.
Switching from MD5 to SHA1 or SHA512 will not improve the security of the construction so much. Computing a SHA256 or SHA512 hash is very fast. An attacker with common hardware could still try tens of millions (with a single CPU) or even billions (with a single GPU) of hashes per second.

","Let's assume the next point : the hackers steal our database including the users and password (encrypted). And the hackers created a fake account with a password that they know.
MD5 is weak because its short and popular and practically every hash generation without password is weak of a dictionary attack.  But..
So, let's say that we are still using MD5 with a SALT.   The hackers don't know the SALT but they know the password of a specific user.  So they can test : ?????12345 where 12345 is the know password and ????? is the salt. The hackers sooner or later can guess the SALT.
However, if we used a MD5+SALT and we applied MD5, then there is not way to recover the information.   However, i repeat, MD5 is still short.
For example, let's say that my password is : 12345. The SALT is BILLCLINTON
md5 : 827ccb0eea8a706c4c34a16891f84e7b
md5 with the hash : 56adb0f19ac0fb50194c312d49b15378
mD5 with the hash over md5 : 28a03c0bc950decdd9ee362907d1798a   I tried to use those online service and i found none that was able to crack it.  And its only MD5! (may be as today it will be crackeable because i generated the md5 online)
If you want to overkill then SHA256 is more than enough if its applied with a salt and twice.
tldr MD5(HASH+MD5(password)) = ok but short, SHA256 is more than enough.

print_r($_POST);

and make sure the data is accurate there, and then echo out what it should look like:
echo hash('sha256', $_POST['ppasscode']);

Compare this output to what you have in the database (manually). By doing this you're exploring your possible points of failure:

Getting password from form
hashing the password
stored password

","First of all, sha256 is a hashing algorithm, not a type of encryption. An encryption would require having a way to decrypt the information back to its original value (collisions aside).
Looking at your code, it seems it should work if you are providing the correct parameter.

Try using a literal string in your code first, and verify its validity instead of using the $_POST[] variable
Try moving the comparison from the database query to the code (get the hash for the given user and compare to the hash you have just calculated)

But most importantly before deploying this in any kind of public fashion, please remember to sanitize your inputs. Don't allow arbitrary SQL to be insert into the queries. The best idea here would be to use parameterized queries.

","The first thing is to make a comparison of functions of SHA and opt for the safest algorithm that supports your programming language (PHP).
Then you can chew the official documentation to implement the hash() function that receives as argument the hashing algorithm you have chosen and the raw password.
sha256 => 64 bits
sha384 => 96 bits
sha512 => 128 bits

Edit since it comes up a lot in the comments: Yes, we do a more stringent hash again on the server side. The client side hashing is not the final result that we save in the database. The client side hashing is because the human client requests it. They have not given a specific reason why, probably they just like overkill.
","No, there's no way to use browser JavaScript to improve password security. I highly recommend you read this article. In your case, the biggest problem is the chicken-egg problem:

What's the ""chicken-egg problem"" with delivering Javascript cryptography?
If you don't trust the network to deliver a password, or, worse, don't trust the server not to keep user secrets, you can't trust them to deliver security code. The same attacker who was sniffing passwords or reading diaries before you introduce crypto is simply hijacking crypto code after you do.

[...]

Why can't I use TLS/SSL to deliver the Javascript crypto code?
You can. It's harder than it sounds, but you safely transmit Javascript crypto to a browser using SSL. The problem is, having established a secure channel with SSL, you no longer need Javascript cryptography; you have ""real"" cryptography.

Which leads to this:

The problem with running crypto code in Javascript is that practically any function that the crypto depends on could be overridden silently by any piece of content used to build the hosting page. Crypto security could be undone early in the process (by generating bogus random numbers, or by tampering with constants and parameters used by algorithms), or later (by spiriting key material back to an attacker), or --- in the most likely scenario --- by bypassing the crypto entirely.
There is no reliable way for any piece of Javascript code to verify its execution environment. Javascript crypto code can't ask, ""am I really dealing with a random number generator, or with some facsimile of one provided by an attacker?"" And it certainly can't assert ""nobody is allowed to do anything with this crypto secret except in ways that I, the author, approve of"". These are two properties that often are provided in other environments that use crypto, and they're impossible in Javascript.

Basically the problem is this:

Your clients don't trust your servers, so they want to add extra security code.
That security code is delivered by your servers (the ones they don't trust).

Or alternatively,

Your clients don't trust SSL, so they want you use extra security code.
That security code is delivered via SSL.

Note: Also, SHA-256 isn't suitable for this, since it's so easy to brute force unsalted non-iterated passwords. If you decide to do this anyway, look for an implementation of bcrypt, scrypt or PBKDF2.

","The Stanford JS Crypto Library contains an implementation of SHA-256. While crypto in JS isn't really as well-vetted an endeavor as other implementation platforms, this one is at least partially developed by, and to a certain extent sponsored by, Dan Boneh, who is a well-established and trusted name in cryptography, and means that the project has some oversight by someone who actually knows what he's doing. The project is also supported by the NSF.
It's worth pointing out, however...
... that if you hash the password client-side before submitting it, then the hash is the password, and the original password becomes irrelevant. An attacker needs only to intercept the hash in order to impersonate the user, and if that hash is stored unmodified on the server, then the server is storing the true password (the hash) in plain-text.
So your security is now worse because you decided add your own improvements to what was previously a trusted scheme.

The advantage of this higher level interface is that you simply need to swap out the EVP_sha256() call with another digest's function, e.g. EVP_sha512(), to use a different digest. So it adds some flexibility.

I am using Windows 7 64 bit, and I downloaded VS C++ today, so it should be the newest version.
","(This is already answered in comments, but since it lacks an actual answer, I'm writing this.)
This problem arises in newer versions of Visual C++ (the older versions usually just silently linked the program and it would crash and burn at run time.) It means that some of the libraries you are linking with your program (or even some of the source files inside your program itself) are using different versions of the CRT (the C RunTime library.)
To correct this error, you need to go into your Project Properties (and/or those of the libraries you are using,) then into C/C++, then Code Generation, and check the value of Runtime Library; this should be exactly the same for all the files and libraries you are linking together. (The rules are a little more relaxed for linking with DLLs, but I'm not going to go into the ""why"" and into more details here.)
There are currently four options for this setting:

Multithreaded Debug
Multithreaded Debug DLL
Multithreaded Release
Multithreaded Release DLL

Your particular problem seems to stem from you linking a library built with ""Multithreaded Debug"" (i.e. static multithreaded debug CRT) against a program that is being built using the ""Multithreaded Debug DLL"" setting (i.e. dynamic multithreaded debug CRT.) You should change this setting either in the library, or in your program. For now, I suggest changing this in your program.
Note that since Visual Studio projects use different sets of project settings for debug and release builds (and 32/64-bit builds) you should make sure the settings match in all of these project configurations.
For (some) more information, you can see these (linked from a comment above):

Linker Tools Warning LNK4098 on MSDN
/MD, /ML, /MT, /LD (Use Run-Time Library) on MSDN
Build errors with VC11 Beta - mixing MTd libs with MDd exes fail to link on Bugzilla@Mozilla

UPDATE: (This is in response to a comment that asks for the reason that this much care must be taken.)
If two pieces of code that we are linking together are themselves linking against and using the standard library, then the standard library must be the same for both of them, unless great care is taken about how our two code pieces interact and pass around data. Generally, I would say that for almost all situations just use the exact same version of the standard library runtime (regarding debug/release, threads, and obviously the version of Visual C++, among other things like iterator debugging, etc.)
The most important part of the problem is this: having the same idea about the size of objects on either side of a function call.
Consider for example that the above two pieces of code are called A and B. A is compiled against one version of the standard library, and B against another. In A's view, some random object that a standard function returns to it (e.g. a block of memory or an iterator or a FILE object or whatever) has some specific size and layout (remember that structure layout is determined and fixed at compile time in C/C++.) For any of several reasons, B's idea of the size/layout of the same objects is different (it can be because of additional debug information, natural evolution of data structures over time, etc.)
Now, if A calls the standard library and gets an object back, then passes that object to B, and B touches that object in any way, chances are that B will mess that object up (e.g. write the wrong field, or past the end of it, etc.)
The above isn't the only kind of problems that can happen. Internal global or static objects in the standard library can cause problems too. And there are more obscure classes of problems as well.
All this gets weirder in some aspects when using DLLs (dynamic runtime library) instead of libs (static runtime library.)
This situation can apply to any library used by two pieces of code that work together, but the standard library gets used by most (if not almost all) programs, and that increases the chances of clash.
What I've described is obviously a watered down and simplified version of the actual mess that awaits you if you mix library versions. I hope that it gives you an idea of why you shouldn't do it!

I downloaded and extracted Crypto++ in C:\cryptopp. I used Visual Studio Express 2012 to build all the projects inside (as instructed in readme), and everything was built successfully. Then I made a test project in some other folder and added cryptolib as a dependency.

The conversion was probably not successful. The only thing that was successful was the running of VCUpgrade. The actual conversion itself failed but you don't know until you experience the errors you are seeing. For some of the details, see Visual Studio on the Crypto++ wiki.


Any ideas how to fix this?

To resolve your issues, you should download vs2010.zip if you want static C/C++ runtime linking (/MT or /MTd), or vs2010-dynamic.zip if you want dynamic C/C++ runtime linking (/MT or /MTd). Both fix the latent, silent failures produced by VCUpgrade.

vs2010.zip, vs2010-dynamic.zip and vs2005-dynamic.zip are built from the latest GitHub sources. As of this writing (JUN 1 2016), that's effectively pre-Crypto++ 5.6.4. If you are using the ZIP files with a down level Crypto++, like 5.6.2 or 5.6.3, then you will run into minor problems.
There are two minor problems I am aware. First is a rename of bench.cpp to bench1.cpp. Its error is either:

C1083: Cannot open source file: 'bench1.cpp': No such file or directory
LNK2001: unresolved external symbol ""void __cdecl OutputResultOperations(char const *,char const *,bool,unsigned long,double)"" (?OutputResultOperations@@YAXPBD0_NKN@Z)

The fix is to either (1) open cryptest.vcxproj in notepad, find bench1.cpp, and then rename it to bench.cpp. Or (2) rename bench.cpp to bench1.cpp on the filesystem. Please don't delete this file.
The second problem is a little trickier because its a moving target. Down level releases, like 5.6.2 or 5.6.3, are missing the latest classes available in GitHub. The missing class files include HKDF (5.6.3), RDRAND (5.6.3), RDSEED (5.6.3), ChaCha (5.6.4), BLAKE2 (5.6.4), Poly1305 (5.6.4), etc.
The fix is to remove the missing source files from the Visual Studio project files since they don't exist for the down level releases.
Another option is to add the missing class files from the latest sources, but there could be complications. For example, many of the sources subtly depend upon the latest config.h, cpu.h and cpu.cpp. The ""subtlety"" is you won't realize you are getting an under-performing class.
An example of under-performing class is BLAKE2. config.h adds compile time ARM-32 and ARM-64 detection. cpu.h and cpu.cpp adds runtime ARM instruction detection, which depends upon compile time detection. If you add BLAKE2 without the other files, then none of the detection occurs and you get a straight C/C++ implementation. You probably won't realize you are missing the NEON opportunity, which runs around 9 to 12 cycles-per-byte versus 40 cycles-per-byte or so for vanilla C/C++.

","I had this problem along with mismatch in ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL.
As a sunday-evening problem after all seemed ok and good to go, I was put out for some time.
Working in de VS2017 IDE (Solution Explorer) I had recently added/copied a sourcefile reference to my project (ctrl-drag) from another project. Looking into properties->C/C++/Preprocessor - at source file level, not project level - I noticed that in a Release configuration _DEBUG was specified instead of NDEBUG for this source file.
Which was all the change needed to get rid of the problem.

Yes, on most CPUs, SHA-256 is about only 40% as fast as MD5.
To 2):
I would argue for a different algorithms than MD5 in such a case. I would definitely prefer an algorithm that is considered safe. However, this is more a feeling. Cases where this matters would be rather constructed than realistic, e.g. if your backup system encounters an example case of an attack on an MD5-based certificate, you are likely to have two files in such an example with different data, but identical MD5 checksums. For the rest of the cases, it doesn't matter, because MD5 checksums have a collision (= same checksums for different data) virtually only when provoked intentionally.
I'm not an expert on the various hashing (checksum generating) algorithms, so I can not suggest another algorithm. Hence this part of the question is still open.
Suggested further reading is Cryptographic Hash Function - File or Data Identifier on Wikipedia. Also further down on that page there is a list of cryptographic hash algorithms.

MD5 is an algorithm to calculate checksums. A checksum calculated using this algorithm is then called an MD5 checksum.

SHA256 takes somewhat more time to calculate than MD5, according to this answer.

No, it's less fast but not that slow
For a backup program it's maybe necessary to have something even faster than MD5

All in all, I'd say that MD5 in addition to the file name is absolutely safe. SHA-256 would just be slower and harder to handle because of its size.
You could also use something less secure than MD5 without any problem. If nobody tries to hack your file integrity this is safe, too.

Does using MD5 produce a checksum?

","The underlying MD5 algorithm is no longer deemed secure, thus while md5sum is well-suited for identifying known files in situations that are not security related, it should not be relied on if there is a chance that files have been purposefully and maliciously tampered. In the latter case, the use of a newer hashing tool such as sha256sum is highly recommended.
So, if you are simply looking to check for file corruption or file differences, when the source of the file is trusted, MD5 should be sufficient.  If you are looking to verify the integrity of a file coming from an untrusted source, or over from a trusted source over an unencrypted connection, MD5 is not sufficient.
Another commenter noted that Ubuntu and others use MD5 checksums.  Ubuntu has moved to PGP and SHA256, in addition to MD5, but the documentation of the stronger verification strategies are more difficult to find.  See the HowToSHA256SUM page for more details.

","Every answer seems to suggest that you need to use secure hashes to do the job but all of these are tuned to be slow to force a bruteforce attacker to have lots of computing power and depending on your needs this may not be the best solution.
There are algorithms specifically designed to hash files as fast as possible to check integrity and comparison (murmur, XXhash...). Obviously these are not designed for security as they don't meet the requirements of a secure hash algorithm (i.e. randomness) but have low collision rates for large messages. This features make them ideal if you are not looking for security but speed.
Examples of this algorithms and comparison can be found in this excellent answer: Which hashing algorithm is best for uniqueness and speed?.
As an example, we at our Q&A site use murmur3 to hash the images uploaded by the users so we only store them once even if users upload the same image in several answers.

","
Yes, on most CPUs, SHA-256 is two to three times slower than MD5, though not primarily because of its longer hash. See other answers here and the answers to this Stack Overflow questions.
Here's a backup scenario where MD5 would not be appropriate:


Your backup program hashes each file being backed up. It then stores
each file's data by its hash, so if you're backing up the same file
twice you only end up with one copy of it.
An attacker can cause the system to backup files they control.
The attacker knows the MD5 hash of a file they want to remove from the
backup.
The attacker can then use the known weaknesses of MD5 to craft a new
file that has the same hash as the file to remove. When that file is
backed up, it will replace the file to remove, and that file's backed up
data will be lost.
This backup system could be strengthened a bit (and made more efficient)
by not replacing files whose hash it has previously encountered, but
then an attacker could prevent a target file with a known hash from
being backed up by preemptively backing up a specially constructed bogus
file with the same hash.
Obviously most systems, backup and otherwise, do not satisfy the
conditions necessary for this attack to be practical, but I just wanted
to give an example of a situation where SHA-256 would be preferable to
MD5. Whether this would be the case for the system you're creating
depends on more than just the characteristics of MD5 and SHA-256.

Yes, cryptographic hashes like the ones generated by MD5 and SHA-256 are a type of checksum.

Happy hashing!

","You're going to want to use the System.Security.Cryptography namespace; specifically, the MD5 class or the SHA256 class. 
Drawing a bit from the code on this page, and with the knowledge that both classes have the same base class (HashAlgorithm), you could use a function like this:
public string ComputeHash(string input, HashAlgorithm algorithm)
{
   Byte[] inputBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(input);

   Byte[] hashedBytes = algorithm.ComputeHash(inputBytes);

   return BitConverter.ToString(hashedBytes);
}

Then you could call it like this (for MD5):
string hPassword = ComputeHash(password, new MD5CryptoServiceProvider());

Or for SHA256:
string hPassword = ComputeHash(password, new SHA256CryptoServiceProvider());


Edit: Adding Salt Support
As dtb pointed out in the comments, this code would be stronger if it included the ability to add salt. If you're not familiar with it, salt is a set of random bits that are included as an input to the hashing function, which goes a long way to thwart dictionary attacks against a hashed password (e.g., using a rainbow table). Here's a modified version of the ComputeHash function that supports salt:
public static string ComputeHash(string input, HashAlgorithm algorithm, Byte[] salt)
{
   Byte[] inputBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(input);

   // Combine salt and input bytes
   Byte[] saltedInput = new Byte[salt.Length + inputBytes.Length];
   salt.CopyTo(saltedInput, 0);
   inputBytes.CopyTo(saltedInput, salt.Length);

   Byte[] hashedBytes = algorithm.ComputeHash(saltedInput);

   return BitConverter.ToString(hashedBytes);
}

","If you are going to be storing the hashed passwords, use bcrypt instead of SHA-256.  The problem is that SHA-256 is optimized for speed, which makes it easier for a brute force attack on passwords should someone get access to your database.
Read this article: Enough With The Rainbow Tables: What You Need To Know About Secure Password Schemes and this answer to a previous SO question.
Some quotes from the article:

The problem is that MD5 is fast. So are its modern competitors, like SHA1 and SHA256. Speed is a design goal of a modern secure hash, because hashes are a building block of almost every cryptosystem, and usually get demand-executed on a per-packet or per-message basis.
Speed is exactly what you don’t want in a password hash function.



Finally, we learned that if we want to store passwords securely we have three reasonable options: PHK’s MD5 scheme, Provos-Maziere’s Bcrypt scheme, and SRP. We learned that the correct choice is Bcrypt.

","Don't use a simple hash, or even a salted hash. Use some sort of key-strengthening technique like bcrypt (with a .NET implementation here) or PBKDF2 (with a built-in implementation).

string password = GetPasswordFromUserInput();

byte[] salt, key;
// load salt and key from database

using (var deriveBytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, salt))
{
    byte[] newKey = deriveBytes.GetBytes(20);  // derive a 20-byte key

","You should always salt the password before hashing when storing them in the database.
Recommended database columns:

PasswordSalt : int
PasswordHash : binary(20)

Most posts you find online will talk about ASCII encoding the salt and hash, but that is not needed and only add unneeded computation. Also if you use SHA-1, then the output will only be 20 bytes so your hash field in the database only needs to be 20 bytes in length. I understand your asking about SHA-256, but unless you have a compelling reason, using SHA-1 with a salt value will be sufficient in most business practices. If you insist on SHA-256, then the hash field in the database needs to be 32 bytes in length.
Below are a few functions that will generate the salt, compute the hash and verify the hash against a password. 
The salt function below generates a cryptographically strong salt as an Integer from 4 cryptographically created random bytes.
private int GenerateSaltForPassword()
{
    RNGCryptoServiceProvider rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();
    byte[] saltBytes = new byte[4];
    rng.GetNonZeroBytes(saltBytes);
    return (((int)saltBytes[0]) << 24) + (((int)saltBytes[1]) << 16) + (((int)saltBytes[2]) << 8) + ((int)saltBytes[3]);
}

The password can then be hashed using the salt with the function below.  The salt is concatenated to the password and then the hash is computed.

private byte[] ComputePasswordHash(string password, int salt)
{
    byte[] saltBytes = new byte[4];
    saltBytes[0] = (byte)(salt >> 24);
    saltBytes[1] = (byte)(salt >> 16);
    saltBytes[2] = (byte)(salt >> 8);
    saltBytes[3] = (byte)(salt);

    byte[] passwordBytes = UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(password);

    byte[] preHashed = new byte[saltBytes.Length + passwordBytes.Length];
    System.Buffer.BlockCopy(passwordBytes, 0, preHashed, 0, passwordBytes.Length);
    System.Buffer.BlockCopy(saltBytes, 0, preHashed, passwordBytes.Length, saltBytes.Length);

    SHA1 sha1 = SHA1.Create();
    return sha1.ComputeHash(preHashed);
}


Checking the password can be done simply by computing the hash and then comparing it to the expected hash.

private bool IsPasswordValid(string passwordToValidate, int salt, byte[] correctPasswordHash)
{
    byte[] hashedPassword = ComputePasswordHash(passwordToValidate, salt);

    return hashedPassword.SequenceEqual(correctPasswordHash);
}

","TL;DR use Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cryptography.KeyDerivation, implementing PBKDF2 with SHA-512.
The good idea to get started with password hashing is to look at what OWASP guidelines say. The list of recommended algorithms includes Argon2, PBKDF2, scrypt, and bcrypt. All these algorithms can be tuned to adjust the time it takes to hash a password, and, correspondingly, the time to crack it via brute-force. All these algorithms utilize salt to protect from rainbow tables attacks.
Neither of these algorithms is terribly weak, but there are some differences:

bcrypt has been around for almost 20 years, has been widely used and
has withstood the test of time. It is pretty resistant to GPU
attacks, but not to FPGA
Argon2 is the newest addition, being a winner of 2015 Password hashing competition. It has better protection against GPU and FPGA attacks, but is a bit too recent to my liking
I don't know much about scrypt. It has been designed to thwart GPU- and FPGA- accelerated attacks, but I've heard it turned out to be not as strong as originally claimed
PBKDF2 is a family of algorithms parametrized by the different hash
functions. It does not offer a specific protection against GPU or ASIC attacks, especially if a weaker hash function like SHA-1 is used, but it is, however, FIPS-certified if it matters to you, and still acceptable if the number of iterations is large enough.

Based on algorithms alone, I would probably go with bcrypt, PBKDF2 being the least favorable.
However, it's not the full story, because even the best algorithm can be made insecure by a bad implementation. Let's look at what is available for .NET platform:

Bcrypt is available via bcrypt.net. They say the implementation is based on Java jBCrypt. Currently there are 6 contributors and 8 issues (all closed) on github. Overall, it looks good, however, I don't know if anyone has made an audit of the code, and it's hard to tell whether an updated version will be available soon enough if a vulnerability is found. I've heard Stack Overflow moved away from using bcrypt because of such reasons
Probably the best way to use Argon2 is through bindings to the
well-known libsodium library, e.g.
https://github.com/adamcaudill/libsodium-net. The idea is that
the most of the crypto is implemented via libsodium, which has considerable
support, and the 'untested' parts are pretty limited. However, in
cryptography details mean a lot, so combined with Argon2 being
relatively recent, I'd treat it as an experimental option
For a long time, .NET had a built-in an implementation of PBKDF2 via 
Rfc2898DeriveBytes class. However, the implementation can only use SHA-1 hash function, which is deemed too fast to be secure nowadays
Finally, the most recent solution is
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cryptography.KeyDerivation package
available via NuGet. It provides PBKDF2 algorithm with SHA-1, SHA-256, or SHA-512 hash functions, which is considerably better than Rfc2898DeriveBytes. The biggest advantage here is that the implementation is supplied by Microsoft, and while I cannot properly assess cryptographic diligence of Microsoft developers versus BCrypt.net or libsodium developers, it just makes sense to trust it because if you are running a .NET application, you are heavily relying on Microsoft already. We might also expect Microsoft to release updates if security issues are found. Hopefully.

To summarize the research up to this point, while PBKDF2 might be the least preferred algorithm of the four, the availability of Microsoft-supplied implementation trumps that, so the reasonable decision would be to use Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cryptography.KeyDerivation.
The recent package at the moment targets .NET Standard 2.0, so available in .NET Core 2.0 or .NET Framework 4.6.1 or later. If you use earlier framework version, it is possible to use the previous version of the package, 1.1.3, which targets .NET Framework 4.5.1 or .NET Core 1.0. Unfortunately, it is not possible to use it in even earlier versions of .NET.
The documentation and the working example is available at docs.microsoft.com. However, do not copy-paste it as it is, there are still decisions a developer needs to make.
The first decision is what hash function to use. Available options include SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512. Of those, SHA-1 is definitely too fast to be secure, SHA-256 is decent, but I would recommend SHA-512, because supposedly, its 64-bit operations usage makes it harder to benefit from GPU-based attacks.
Then, you need to choose the password hash output length and the salt length. It doesn't make sense to have output longer than the hash function output (e.g. 512 bits for SHA-512), and it would probably be the most secure to have it exactly like that. For the salt length, opinions differ. 128 bits should be enough, but in any case, the length longer than the hash output length surely doesn't provide any benefits.
Next, there is an iteration count. The bigger it is, the harder password hashes are to crack, but the longer it takes to log users in. I'd suggest to choose it so the hashing takes 0.25 - 1 seconds on the typical production system, and in any case, it should not be less than 10000.
Normally, you would get bytes array as salt and hash values. Use Base64 to convert them to strings. You can opt to use two different columns in the database, or combine salt and password in one column using a separator which is not encountered in Base64.
Don't forget to devise a password hashing storage in a way that allows to seamlessly move to a better hashing algorithm in future.

FYI Hashing is not encrypting. It is irreversible. Encryption is a process that is reversible to get the original data.

SHA-2 is a set of cryptographic hash functions (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512)

","You have to convert explicitly between Int and CC_LONG, because Swift does not
do implicit conversions, as in (Objective-)C.
You also have to define hash as an array of the required size.
func sha256(data : NSData) -> NSData {
    var hash = [UInt8](count: Int(CC_SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH), repeatedValue: 0)
    CC_SHA256(data.bytes, CC_LONG(data.length), &hash)
    let res = NSData(bytes: hash, length: Int(CC_SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH))

Alternatively, you can use NSMutableData to allocate the needed buffer:
func sha256(data : NSData) -> NSData {
    let res = NSMutableData(length: Int(CC_SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH))
    CC_SHA256(data.bytes, CC_LONG(data.length), UnsafeMutablePointer(res.mutableBytes))

"13419201","Why are the RSA-SHA256 signatures I generate with OpenSSL and Java different?","I want to generate a RSA-SHA256 signature in Java, but I can't get it to produce the same signature as with OpenSSL on the console.
This is what I did with OpenSSL (following this tutorial):
Generate key pair:
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 1024

Extract public key:
openssl rsa -in private.pem -out public.pem -outform PEM -pubout

Create hash of data:
echo 'data to sign' > data.txt
openssl dgst -sha256 < data.txt > hash

The generated hash file starts with (stdin)= what I removed by hand (first forgot to mention it, thanks mata).
Sign hash:
openssl rsautl -sign -inkey private.pem -keyform PEM -in hash  > signature

To reproduce the results in Java I first converted the private key from PEM to DER:
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform DER -in private.pem -nocrypt > private.der

Now I wrote this Java class to generate the same signature:
public class RSATest {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException,
            NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException,
            InvalidKeyException, SignatureException {

        byte[] encodedPrivateKey = readFile(""private.der"");
        byte[] content = readFile(""data.txt"");

        KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
        PKCS8EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(encodedPrivateKey);
        RSAPrivateKey privateKey = (RSAPrivateKey) keyFactory
                .generatePrivate(keySpec);

        Signature signature = Signature.getInstance(""SHA256withRSA"");
        signature.initSign(privateKey);
        signature.update(content);
        byte[] signatureBytes = signature.sign();

        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(""signature-java"");
        fos.write(signatureBytes);
        fos.close();
    }

    private static byte[] readFile(String filename) throws IOException {
        File file = new File(filename);
        BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(
                file));
        byte[] bytes = new byte[(int) file.length()];
        bis.read(bytes);
        bis.close();
        return bytes;
    }

}

Unfortunately the results are not the same, so I think I must have done something wrong, but I can't figure out what. Can someone of you help me to find the bug?
","openssl dgst -sha256 < data.txt

produces something like:

(stdin)= b39eaeb437e33087132f01c2abc60c6a16904ee3771cd7b0d622d01061b40729

notice the (stdin)='? you don't want that to be part of your hash, if you need to create a digest, use the -binary option.
try using this to sign your data:
openssl sha -sha256 -sign private.pem < data.txt

This does everything you need.

edit - a little more explanations:
let's create a digest and show it
$ openssl dgst -sha256 -binary < data.txt > digest
$ hd digest
00000000  26 3b 0a a1 2e b9 32 db  b8 dc d3 6f 37 94 0b 05  |&;....2....o7...|
00000010  71 9c ba 79 46 34 28 9f  5c 5b 98 9a 64 61 c9 ec  |q..yF4(.\[..da..|

now we take this digest and sign int using rsautl:
$ openssl rsautl -sign -inkey private.pem < digest > sign1
$ hd sign1
00000000  1b 7a cf a4 8d 41 8e 04  ed 3a bb ba 86 f1 f8 e0  |.z...A...:......|
00000010  df f7 47 3e d7 a7 f4 90  7a 05 f8 7f 45 e5 29 e7  |..G>....z...E.).|
00000020  9f f4 2c 91 97 2f e7 26  69 9f 6a 07 a3 48 1b 85  |..,../.&i.j..H..|
00000030  2e f8 ee 44 4d 25 9f ae  05 95 81 c9 e3 07 68 ad  |...DM%........h.|

now let's sign the same file using dgst directly:
$ openssl dgst -sha256 -sign private.pem < data.txt > sign2
$ hd sign2
00000000  15 c2 94 87 eb e6 cb 45  c8 63 0c 97 60 d3 07 f3  |.......E.c..`...|
00000010  dc 65 32 ad 44 1c c2 2a  7f a3 e1 fc dd 84 27 8c  |.e2.D..*......'.|
00000020  77 a6 97 2b 33 6b c6 d7  7d e1 1d 39 5c 48 b6 48  |w..+3k..}..9\H.H|
00000030  cb 18 be bf 6a 66 90 d3  88 89 52 6c dd d1 b9 99  |....jf....Rl....|

So what's different here? To see that, we can verify the signature and show the raw output. Both files do contain the digest, but the metadata and padding is different:
$ openssl rsautl -raw -verify -inkey private.pem < sign1 | hd
00000000  00 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  |................|
00000010  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00  |................|

00000030  71 9c ba 79 46 34 28 9f  5c 5b 98 9a 64 61 c9 ec  |q..yF4(.\[..da..|

$ openssl rsautl -raw -verify -inkey private.pem < sign2 | hd
00000000  00 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff 00 30 31 30  |.............010|
00000010  0d 06 09 60 86 48 01 65  03 04 02 01 05 00 04 20  |...`.H.e....... |

To see this more clearly, we can try to use the -asn1parse flag, which won't work for the first signature, but for the second it shows the correct structure of the signature:
$ openssl rsautl -verify -inkey private.pem -asn1parse < sign1

$salt =""sometext"";
$escapedPW=""userpass"";
$saltedPW =  $escapedPW . $salt;
$hashedPW = hash('sha256', $saltedPW);

In the database I am storing the user, the user's password and the salt used to make hash and validate the user's  login. Right now I'm doing the functionality to send to the user an email with your password, but when the user receives the email, since is stored in sha256 encrypted password, the user receives a long string and not the password that the user is supposed to know. 
My question is there any way that I can send you the actual user password and non the password encryption, ie, there is some way to do the reverse of sha256 if I know the salt?. If not possible, what method of encryption is recommended for you to complete the reverse of the encryption key and send the actual password to the user in an email. 
","As mentioned in the comments of your question, reversing the hash is not really an option.
What you can do however, and this is what everybody else does as well. In your registration code (ex. register.php) which your form post to you can make the PHP script send the password in an email and then encrypt it and store it in the database.
I suppose you have a registration form of some kind, and that form supposedly posts the new users details to another (or the same) php script, doesn't it?
For example if my form said something like <form method=""post"" action=""register.php"">
And in register.php I would then have something like
<?php
$username = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['username']);
$password = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['password']); /*cleartext*/
$email    = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['email']);

mail($email,""New account"",""Your username \""$username\"" and your password is \""$password\"""");

$salt =""sometext"";
$escapedPW=""userpass"";
$saltedPW =  $escapedPW . $salt;
$hashedPW = hash('sha256', $saltedPW);

mysql_query(""INSERT INTO users (username, password, email) VALUES ($username, $hashedPW, $email)"")

Some rough example code. I hope it helps!

","You should NEVER send plaintext passwords via email. Rather, send a time-limited, single-use ""reset password"" link, as suggested in the comments.
You should not use a simple hash as suggested by @Henrik.  Use a standard adjustable-work password KDF (PBKDF2,bcrypt,scrypt)
If you can use PHP 5.5, use the standard password hashing functions.  There are hosts which do support PHP 5.5, but you have to look for them and ask for it.
There are many places on the web that explain how to do it correctly (e.g. https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAppSec/Secure_Coding_Guidelines#Authentication) and many that explain how to do it incorrectly. PLEASE take some time to research this before you decide to roll your own authentication system.

","You make a very common beginners mistake... Putting the libraries you link with in the wrong place on the command line when you build.
Dependencies are reversed on the command line, so something that depends on something else should actually be put before what it depends on on the command line.
In your example, you have a source file main.cpp that depends on some set of libraries, then the source file should be before the libraries it depend on:
$ g++ -o main main.cpp -lssl -lcrypto

To be safe, always put libraries last, after any source or object files listed on the command line.

I'm using the SHA256() function found here as a wrapper for OpenSSL's SHA256 functionality.
When I attempt to compile with the following g++ arguments, I receive the following error:
millinon@myhost:~/Programming/sha256$ g++ -lssl -lcrypto -o main main.cpp
/tmp/ccYqwPUC.o: In function `sha256(std::string)':

main.cpp:(.text+0x71): undefined reference to `SHA256_Update'
main.cpp:(.text+0x87): undefined reference to `SHA256_Final'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

So, GCC clearly recognizes OpenSSL's defined functions and types, but ld is failing to find the function symbols referred to in sha.h.
Do I need to manually point to a specific shared object or directory?
Thanks!
","This works fine on my system, but you might try:
extern ""C"" {
#include <openssl/sha.h>
}

which tells g++ that all the stuff in openssl/sha.h is declared as ""C"" functions.
BTW, how old is your OpenSSL?

","SHA-256 is a member of SHA-2 cryptographic hash functions family, which usually generates 256 bits or 32 bytes HASH Code from an input message.
It's not an encryption mechanism which implies that from the HASH Code, also known as message digest or simply the digest, you can not regenerate the message.
Hence there's need no key to use SHA-256 to generate message digest.
Moreover, hash functions considered practically impossible to invert, that is, to recreate the input data from its hash value (message digest) alone. So You can't ""decrypt"" a HASH message/message digest to its input message, means reversing is not possible for Hashing. For example,
SHA256(plainText) -> digest

then there is NO mechanism like inverseSHA256 which can do the following,
inverseSHA256(digest) -> plainText

Can anyone please help and provide an explanation?
","The error message means exactly what it says: You have a Unicode string. You can't SHA-256-hash a Unicode string, you can only hash bytes.
But why do you have a Unicode string? Because you're opening a file in text mode, which means you're implicitly asking Python to decode the bytes in that file (using your default encoding) to Unicode. If you want to get the raw bytes, you have to use binary mode.
In other words, just change this line:
with open('words','r') as f:

… to:
with open('words', 'rb') as f:


You may notice that, once you fix this, the print line raises an exception. Why? because you're trying to add a bytes to a str. You're also missing a space, and you're printing the un-stripped line. You could fix all of those by using two arguments to print (as in print(line.rstrip(), ""is one of the words"")).
But then you'll get output like b'\xc3\x85rhus' is one of the words when you wanted it to print out Århus is one of the words. That's because you now have bytes, not strings. Since Python is no longer decoding for you, you'll need to do that manually. To use the same default encoding that sometimes works when you don't specify an encoding to open, just call decode without an argument. So:
print(line.rstrip().decode(), ""is one of the words"")

Update the Hash in a separate thread. This is actually rather hard to do and isn't for the faint hearted as it involves safe publishing between threads. But if your profiling shows a significant amount of time being spent in hash algorithm it may make better use of the disk.

","I suggest you use a profiler like JProfiler or the one integrated in Netbeans (free) to find out, where the time is actually spent and concentrate on that part.
Just a wild guess - not sure if it will help - but have you tried the Server VM? Try starting the app with java -server and see if that helps you. The server VM is more aggressive compiling Java code to native than the default client VM is.

","Since you apparently have a working C++ implementation which is fast, you could build a JNI bridge and use the actual C++ implementation or maybe you could try not reinventing the wheel, especially since it's a big one and use a premade library such as BouncyCastle which has been made to solve all cryptographic needs of your program.

","My explanation may not solve your problem since it depends a lot on your actual runtime environment, but when I run your code on my system, the throughput is limited by disk I/O and not the hash calculation. The problem is not solved by switching to NIO, but is simply caused by the fact that you're reading the file in very small pieces (16kB). Increasing the buffer size (buff) on my system to 1MB instead of 16kB more than doubles the throughput, but with >50MB/s, I am still limited by disk speed and not able to fully load a single CPU core.
BTW: You can simplify your implementation a lot by wrapping a DigestInputStream around a FileInputStream, read through the file and get the calculated hash from the DigestInputStream instead of manually shuffling the data from a RandomAccessFile to the MessageDigest as in your code.

I did a few performance tests with older Java versions and there seem to be a relevant difference between Java 5 and Java 6 here. I'm not sure though if the SHA implementation is optimized or if the VM is executing the code much faster. The throughputs I get with the different Java versions (1MB buffer) are:

Sun JDK 1.5.0_15 (client): 28MB/s, limited by CPU
Sun JDK 1.5.0_15 (server): 45MB/s, limited by CPU
Sun JDK 1.6.0_16 (client): 42MB/s, limited by CPU
Sun JDK 1.6.0_16 (server): 52MB/s, limited by disk I/O (85-90% CPU load)


I was a little bit curious on the impact of the assembler part in the CryptoPP SHA implementation, as the benchmarks results indicate that the SHA-256 algorithm only requires 15.8 CPU cycles/byte on an Opteron. I was unfortunately not able to build CryptoPP with gcc on cygwin (the build succeeded, but the generated exe failed immediately), but building a performance benchmark with VS2005 (default release configuration) with and without assembler support in CryptoPP and comparing to the Java SHA implementation on an in-memory buffer, leaving out any disk I/O, I get the following results on a 2.5GHz Phenom:

Sun JDK1.6.0_13 (server): 26.2 cycles/byte
CryptoPP (C++ only): 21.8 cycles/byte
CryptoPP (assembler): 13.3 cycles/byte

Both benchmarks compute the SHA hash of a 4GB empty byte array, iterating over it in chunks of 1MB, which are passed to MessageDigest#update (Java) or CryptoPP's SHA256.Update function (C++). 
I was able to build and benchmark CryptoPP with gcc 4.4.1 (-O3) in a virtual machine running Linux and got only appr. half the throughput compared to the results from the VS exe. I am not sure how much of the difference is contributed to the virtual machine and how much is caused by VS usually producing better code than gcc, but I have no way to get any more exact results from gcc right now.

","The MAIN reason why your code is so slow is because you use a RandomAccessFile which always has been quite slow performance-wise. I suggest using a ""BufferedInputStream"" so that you may benefit from all the power of the OS-level caching for disk-i/o.
The code should look something like:
    public static byte [] hash(MessageDigest digest, BufferedInputStream in, int bufferSize) throws IOException {
    byte [] buffer = new byte[bufferSize];
    int sizeRead = -1;
    while ((sizeRead = in.read(buffer)) != -1) {
        digest.update(buffer, 0, sizeRead);
    }
    in.close();

    byte [] hash = null;
    hash = new byte[digest.getDigestLength()];
    hash = digest.digest();
    return hash;

Can anyone provide some help with code ??

i came up with this code :

        Reference ref = fac.newReference("""", fac.newDigestMethod(DigestMethod.SHA256, null));

        // Create the SignedInfo
        SignedInfo si = fac.newSignedInfo(
                fac.newCanonicalizationMethod(CanonicalizationMethod.EXCLUSIVE, (C14NMethodParameterSpec) null),
                fac.newSignatureMethod(SignatureMethod.RSA_SHA1, null), Collections.singletonList(ref));

        KeyPairGenerator kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"");
        kpg.initialize(512);
        KeyPair kp = kpg.generateKeyPair();

        KeyInfoFactory kif = fac.getKeyInfoFactory();
        KeyValue kv = kif.newKeyValue(kp.getPublic());

        KeyInfo ki = kif.newKeyInfo(Collections.singletonList(kv));

        DOMSignContext dsc = new DOMSignContext(kp.getPrivate(), doc.getDocumentElement());

        XMLSignature signature = fac.newXMLSignature(si, ki);
        signature.sign(dsc);

        TransformerFactory tf = TransformerFactory.newInstance();
        Transformer trans = tf.newTransformer();
        trans.transform(new DOMSource(doc), new StreamResult(new FileOutputStream(""mySignedFile"")));

        return doc;
    }

but the Problem is i am getting :
<SignatureMethod Algorithm=""http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1""/>

and not :

","You got <SignatureMethod Algorithm=""http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1""/>, because that's what you asked for: fac.newSignatureMethod(SignatureMethod.RSA_SHA1, null).

Thanks to interjay's answer I was able to generate the final hash.
","This line will give the wrong results:
unsigned int nDataLen = sizeof(pbData);

It will always give you the size of a pointer. What you want instead is data.size().
Also, you don't need this part:
if(!CryptoPP::SHA256().VerifyDigest(abDigest, pbData, nDataLen))
{
    return SHA256(data);
}

It should always verify correctly, since you just calculated the digest based on the same data. And if it didn't, you'd go into infinite recursion.
To get readable output, you can convert it to hex. Here's an example for MD5 from the Crypto++ Wiki, it should work for you if you replace MD5 with SHA256:
CryptoPP::MD5 hash;
byte digest[ CryptoPP::MD5::DIGESTSIZE ];
std::string message = ""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"";

hash.CalculateDigest( digest, (byte*) message.c_str(), message.length() );

CryptoPP::HexEncoder encoder;
std::string output;
encoder.Attach( new CryptoPP::StringSink( output ) );
encoder.Put( digest, sizeof(digest) );
encoder.MessageEnd();

std::cout << output << std::endl;

"11415055","How to use HMAC SHA256?","As per the various docs that I have read for using HMAC SHA256, I have understood that:
H (K XOR opad, H (K XOR ipad, text)) where H in my case is SHA256.
But, SHA256 input has only one parameter i.e a Message.
Whereas H(K,text) has two inputs.
So how to calculate H(k,text)?
Should I first encode text with k and then use H(encoded_text), where encoded_text will be used as a message?
Thank You
","
H() is your cryptographic hash function, in this case SHA256() but
could also be MD5 or whatever; 
K is your predifined key
Text is the message to be authenticated
opad be the outer padding (0x5c5c5c…5c5c, one-block-long hexadecimal
constant)
ipad be the inner padding  (0x363636…3636, one-block-long hexadecimal
constant)
Then HMAC(K,m)  is mathematically defined by 

HMAC(K,m) = H((K ⊕ opad)    ∥ H((K ⊕ ipad)    ∥ m)).

blocksized is determined by your hash function (MD5 would be 64
bytes)
o_key_pad = [opad * blocksize] ⊕ key
i_key_pad = [ipad * blocksize] ⊕ key

Your result would be:
H(o_key_pad || H(i_key_pad || TEXT))

You can find a good read here:
http://timdinh.nl/index.php/hmac/
With also the following pseudocode which almost looks like mine :
function hmac (key, message)
    opad = [0x5c * blocksize] // Where blocksize is that of the underlying hash function
    ipad = [0x36 * blocksize]

    if (length(key) > blocksize) then
        key = hash(key) // Where 'hash' is the underlying hash function
    end if

    for i from 0 to length(key) - 1 step 1
        ipad[i] = ipad[i] XOR key[i]
        opad[i] = opad[i] XOR key[i]
    end for

    return hash(opad || hash(ipad || message)) // Where || is concatenation
end function

","I've been trying to do this exact thing, and found the following did the trick. This approach relies on using two Authenticode certificates, one for SHA-1 and another for SHA-256, in order to ensure the files are accepted as valid by Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 which do not support being signed by a SHA-256 certificate even if the SHA-1 algorithm is used:
signtool.exe sign /sha1 SHA1_Thumprint /v /d ""FileDescription"" /du ""CompanyURL"" /fd sha1 /tr http://timestamp.comodoca.com/rfc3161 /td sha1 ""FileName.dll""
signtool.exe sign /sha1 SHA256_Thumprint /as /v /d ""FileDescription"" /du ""CompanyURL"" /fd sha256 /tr http://timestamp.comodoca.com/rfc3161 /td sha256 ""FileName.dll""

Note that the SHA-1 thumbprints are explicitly specified for each signing step using the /sha1 switch and that /as is used to append the SHA-256 signature. Otherwise the SHA-256 signature will override the SHA-1 signature.
The other gotcha I found in the process was that only DLLs and EXEs support dual signatures. MSI installers do not.
Updated 29/12/15:
The format of the SHA-1/SHA-256 thumbprint is a 40-character hexadecimal upper case string with no spaces. For example:
signtool.exe sign /sha1 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF01234567 /as /v /d ""FileDescription"" /du ""CompanyURL"" /fd sha256 /tr http://timestamp.comodoca.com/rfc3161 /td sha256 ""FileName.dll""

Updated 30/12/2015
To sign an MSI file with a SHA-256 certificate but with a SHA-1 hash use a command similar to the below:
signtool.exe sign /sha1 SHA256_Thumprint /v /d ""FileDescription"" /du ""CompanyURL"" /t http://timestamp.comodoca.com/authenticode ""FileName.msi""

'Dual signing and include an SHA1 file digest' is possible if you sign SHA1 first, and use /as for the SHA256. It only works with signtool v6.3 from the Windows 8.1 SDK (or later) though.

I'm ideally looking for a SHA512/SHA256 hash, similar to what the SHA() function offers within the linkedin datafu UDFs for Pig.
","HASH function (as of Hive 0.11) uses algorithm similar to java.util.List#hashCode.
Its code looks like this:
int hashCode = 0; // Hive HASH uses 0 as the seed, List#hashCode uses 1. I don't know why.
for (Object item: items) {
   hashCode = hashCode * 31 + (item == null ? 0 : item.hashCode());
}

Basically it's a classic hash algorithm as recommended in the book Effective Java.
To quote a great man (and a great book):

The value 31 was chosen because it is an odd prime. If it were even
  and the multiplication overflowed, information would be lost, as
  multiplication by 2 is equivalent to shifting. The advantage of using
  a prime is less clear, but it is traditional. A nice property of 31 is
  that the multiplication can be replaced by a shift and a subtraction
  for better performance: 31 * i == (i << 5) - i. Modern VMs do this
  sort of optimization automatically.

I digress. You can look at the HASH source here.
If you want to use SHAxxx in Hive then you can use Apache DigestUtils class and Hive built-in reflect function (I hope that'll work):
SELECT reflect('org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils', 'sha256Hex', 'your_string')

","There is technically a limit, but it's quite large. The padding scheme used for SHA-256 requires that the size of the input (in bits) be expressed as a 64-bit number. Therefore, the maximum size is (264-1)/8 bytes ~= 2'091'752 terabytes.
That renders the limit almost entirely theoretical, not practical. 
Most people don't have the storage for nearly that much data anyway, but even if they did, processing it all serially to produce a single hash would take an amount of time most would consider prohibitive.
A quick back-of-the-envelope kind of calculation indicates that even with the fastest enterprise SSDs currently1 listed on Tom's hardware, and striping them 16 wide to improve bandwidth, just reading that quantity of data would still take about 220 years.

","The upper limit is given in the NIST Standard FIPS 180-4. The reason for the upper limit is the padding scheme. The message length l is lastly appended to message during padding.

Then append the 64-bit block that is equal to the number l expressed

Therefore by the NIST standard, the maximum file size can be hashed with SHA-256 is 2^64.

How can I create a sha256 fingerprint in openssl

-sha256 is correct.

There's an example of signing a server's CSR with your own CA using OpenSSL at How do you sign OpenSSL Certificate Signing Requests with your Certification Authority?.

Based on the feedback, it appears SHA1 is hard coded when using -fingerprint. Below is from <openssl dir>/apps/x509.c (all OpenSSL apps, like ca, x509, encrypt, decrypt, etc are located in apps/). From around line 935 of x509.c:
else if (fingerprint == i)
    {
    int j;
    unsigned int n;
    unsigned char md[EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE];
    const EVP_MD *fdig = digest;

    if (!fdig)
        fdig = EVP_sha1();

    if (!X509_digest(x,fdig,md,&n))
        {
        BIO_printf(bio_err,""out of memory\n"");
        goto end;
        }
    BIO_printf(STDout,""%s Fingerprint="", OBJ_nid2sn(EVP_MD_type(fdig)));
    ....

As far as const EVP_MD *fdig = digest, digest can be set. But I can't tell what switch is supposed to be used. From around line 475:
else if ((md_alg=EVP_get_digestbyname(*argv + 1)))
    {
    /* ok */
    digest=md_alg;
    }

That looks broke to me.

","A signature cannot be created by SHA256 alone.
SHA256 is a hashing algorithm; i.e. an algorithm creating a short fingerprint number representing an arbitrary large amount of data. To produce a signature, this fingerprint still has to be treated somehow to allow identification of the holder of some private signature key. One such treatment is to encrypt the fingerprint using the private key of a rsa key pair allowing others to decrypt the result using the associated public key and so verify that the keeper of the private key indeed must have been the signer.
In the context of your crypto API that RSA encryption scheme either is the default treatment when the treatment is not explicitly named, or the kind of treatment is deduced from the private key you use as parameter in the sign call --- if it is a RSA private key, it uses RSA; if it is a DSA key, it uses DSA; ...

It returns the hash correctly, but I need to insert a string like this \x00\x25\x53 and in this case, the function returns a sha256 of empty string because the specified encoding cannot be used to convert the receiver.
Now, my question is:How to insert this special characters for generate a correct hash? Thanks
","Some one looking the solution in Swift 3.0. here is
extension String {

func get_sha256_String() -> String {
    guard let data = self.data(using: .utf8) else {
        print(""Data not available"")
        return """"

    return getHexString(fromData: digest(input: data as NSData))
}

private func digest(input : NSData) -> NSData {
    let digestLength = Int(CC_SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH)
    var hashValue = [UInt8](repeating: 0, count: digestLength)
    CC_SHA256(input.bytes, UInt32(input.length), &hashValue)
    return NSData(bytes: hashValue, length: digestLength)
}

private  func getHexString(fromData data: NSData) -> String {
    var bytes = [UInt8](repeating: 0, count: data.length)
    data.getBytes(&bytes, length: data.length)

    var hexString = """"
    for byte in bytes {

My main and only reason, is to prevent users from having to create new accounts, and to stop using MD5.
","Hashing algorithms are one-way i.e. They cannot be reversed unlike Encryption-Decryption algorithms.
MD5() is a hashing algorithm , so is SHA-1 / SHA-256;
It is good to know that you have stopped using MD5() and moving to SHA-256()
Solution to your problem.
First run a query in your users table like this
UPDATE users_t SET PASSWORD=SHA2(PASSWORD,256) WHERE 1=1

Now all your MD5 Hashed passwords will be converted to SHA256 Hashes.
However, you cannot stop using MD5 on your login/register pages.. You have to change your checking logic like 
$pass = $_POST['password'];
$hashedpass = hash('sha256',md5($pass)); // Now you need to insert/verify

","The key to this question is using JWT and Bouncy castle libraries for encoding the token and signing it respectively.

JWT for encoding and decoding JWT tokens 
Bouncy Castle supports encryption and decryption, especially RS256 get it here

First, you need to transform the private key to the form of RSA parameters. Then you need to pass the RSA parameters to the RSA algorithm as the private key. Lastly, you use the JWT library to encode and sign the token.
    public string GenerateJWTToken(string rsaPrivateKey)
    {
        var rsaParams = GetRsaParameters(rsaPrivateKey);
        var encoder = GetRS256JWTEncoder(rsaParams);

        {
            { ""iss"", """"},
            { ""sub"", """" },
            // and other key-values 
        };

        // add headers. 'alg' and 'typ' key-values are added automatically.
        var header = new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            { ""{header_key}"", ""{your_private_key_id}"" },
        };

        var token = encoder.Encode(header,payload, new byte[0]);

        return token;
    }

    private static IJwtEncoder GetRS256JWTEncoder(RSAParameters rsaParams)
    {
        var csp = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();
        csp.ImportParameters(rsaParams);

        var algorithm = new RS256Algorithm(csp, csp);
        var serializer = new JsonNetSerializer();
        var urlEncoder = new JwtBase64UrlEncoder();
        var encoder = new JwtEncoder(algorithm, serializer, urlEncoder);

        return encoder;
    }

    private static RSAParameters GetRsaParameters(string rsaPrivateKey)
    {
        var byteArray = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(rsaPrivateKey);
        using (var ms = new MemoryStream(byteArray))
        {
            using (var sr = new StreamReader(ms))
            {
                // use Bouncy Castle to convert the private key to RSA parameters
                var pemReader = new PemReader(sr);

","Those hashes are not ASCII–the reason you see hex digits is because the software you use to generate them takes the binary output of the digest and turns it into an ASCII string of hex digits.
For instance, the MD5 digest will fill an array of 16 bytes. You can also represent it as a string of 32 characters, but the most basic form of the digest is still the array of bytes.
When you change an array of bytes into a hex string, you need 8 bits (one full character) to represent every 4 bits of data. Although it's not frequently called that way, you could say that this uses ""base16"" encoding, since you're grabbing 4 bits at a time and mapping them to a 16-character alphabet.
Base64, on the other hand, grabs 6 bits at a time and maps them to a 64-character alphabet. This means that you need 8 bits (again, one full character) to represent every 6 bits of data, which has half the wasted bits of base16. A base16-encoded string will always be twice as big as the original; a base64-encoded string will only be four thirds as big. For a SHA256 hash, base16 does 64 bytes, but base64 does approximately 43.

Since I'm not specifying what algorithm I want, it uses SHA256.
Now, I try to verify this in c#. That didn't turn out easy...
I get an exception about the key size:

IDX10603: The 'System.IdentityModel.Tokens.InMemorySymmetricSecurityKey' cannot have less than: '128' bits.
  Parameternavn: key.KeySize
  The actual size was 48.

I I try to extend the key, I get a new error when creating the symmetric key:

Invalid length for a Base-64 char array or string

I recon this has something to do with the way I'm telling the .net code about my key. Since the SymmetricKeyIssuerSecurityTokenProvider constructor parameter is named base64Key, I have tryed to Base64Url-encode my key:
        var secret =  Base64UrlEncoder.Encode(""secret"");
        TokenValidationParameters validationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
        {

            IssuerSigningTokens = new SymmetricKeyIssuerSecurityTokenProvider(issuer, secret).SecurityTokens
        };

So, what are I missing here?
Why can jsonwebtoken generate and validate jots with short keys while .net can not?
And why can't .net accept the keys I give it?

Note, that I had to resize the array containing the key so that key length passes the validation. It appears that they key length for HMAC is always equal to the block size, and for SHA256 it's 512 bits. There is MinimumSymmetricKeySizeInBits static property that defines the minimum length of a SimmetricKey, but it appears it can't be set to be less than 128.

"10673146","signature with SHA256","I have a smartcard and I need to sign a file with this.
That is a big problem as I see in stackover.
I couldnt use RSACryptoServiceProvider, bkz it doesnt support RSA-SHA256 alogrithm.
At First I used CAPICOM.dll , like code bellow,
SignedData sed = new SignedData();
sed.Content = ""a""; // data to sign
Signer ser = new Signer();
ser.Certificate = cc;
string singnn = sed.Sign(ser, false, CAPICOM_ENCODING_TYPE.CAPICOM_ENCODE_BASE64);

But there isnt a public key to validate my signature value,, I couldnt get a validate key from capicom.dll.
And after , 
I used X509Certificate2 , and RSACryptoServiceProvider  like code below,
        X509Certificate2 certificate = new X509Certificate2();
        // Access Personal (MY) certificate store of current user
        X509Store my = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.CurrentUser);
        my.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);

        // Find the certificate we'll use to sign            
        RSACryptoServiceProvider csp = null;
        foreach (X509Certificate2 cert in my.Certificates)
        {
            if (cert.Subject.Contains(certSubject))
            {
                // We found it. 
                // Get its associated CSP and private key
                certificate = cert;
                csp = (RSACryptoServiceProvider)cert.PrivateKey;
            }
        }
        if (csp == null)
        {
            throw new Exception(""No valid cert was found"");
        }

        // Hash the data
        SHA1Managed sha1 = new SHA1Managed();
        UnicodeEncoding encoding = new UnicodeEncoding();
        byte[] data = encoding.GetBytes(text);
        byte[] hash = sha1.ComputeHash(data);

        //byte[] data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(text);
        //HashAlgorithm sha = new SHA256Managed();
        //byte[] hash = sha.TransformFinalBlock(data, 0, data.Length);

        string key = csp.ToXmlString(false);
        // Sign the hash
        csp.PersistKeyInCsp = true;
        byte[] response = csp.SignData(data, CryptoConfig.MapNameToOID(""SHA1""));
        string signbase64 = Convert.ToBase64String(response);

It works , but I need to sign with RSA-SHA256 algorithm.
When I changw hash algorithm  like this
byte[] response = csp.SignData(data, CryptoConfig.MapNameToOID(""SHA256""));

I m getting an 

error : ""unspecified error"".

Thats my problem,
What is the sollution , or which library should I use ??
Thanks for any advice..
","RSACryptoServiceProvider does work with SHA2-based signatures, but you have to invest some effort into it.
When you use a certificate to get your RSACryptoServiceProvider it really matters what's the underlying CryptoAPI provider. By default, when you create a certificate with 'makecert', it's ""RSA-FULL"" which only supports SHA1 hashes for signature. You need the new ""RSA-AES"" one that supports SHA2.
So, you can create your certificate with an additional option: -sp ""Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider"" (or an equivalent -sy 24) and then your code would look like (in .NET 4.0):
var rsa = signerCertificate.PrivateKey as RSACryptoServiceProvider;
//
byte[] signature = rsa.SignData(data, CryptoConfig.CreateFromName(""SHA256""));

If you are unable to change the way your certificate is issued, there is a semi-ligitimate workaround that is based on the fact that by default RSACryptoServiceProvider is created with support for SHA2. So, the following code would also work, but it is a bit uglier:
(what this code does is it creates a new RSACryptoServiceProvider and imports the keys from the one we got from the certificate)
var rsa = signerCertificate.PrivateKey as RSACryptoServiceProvider;
// Create a new RSACryptoServiceProvider
RSACryptoServiceProvider rsaClear = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();
// Export RSA parameters from 'rsa' and import them into 'rsaClear'
rsaClear.ImportParameters(rsa.ExportParameters(true));
byte[] signature = rsaClear.SignData(data, CryptoConfig.CreateFromName(""SHA256""));

Hope you find this helpful.

No and you probably confuse this with deprecating SHA-1 as a signature algorithm for certificates. This deprecation is independent from TLS itself although certificates are usually used in connection with TLS. And use of SHA-1 or even MD5 as a HMAC for ciphers is still considered safe, because the security assumptions needed for HMAC and certificate signature are different.
Apart from that a better forum for these kind of questions would be security.stackexchange.com.

","You can convert the value to hex and use a char(n) column with the appropriate length - 64 in this case. The conversion can be done in MySQL by using the sha2 function with hash_length set to 256.

I have profiled my code and this snippet is taking exactly 96% of computing time per hash, making this function critical to my goals.
It operates on a 64-byte long binary string named data[] and outputs the result in ctx->state.
I ask for a faster version of this function. Keep in mind that even slight modifications can impact speed negatively.

SHA256 performance optimization in C ...

Now that the Goldmont micro-architecture has been released, it includes Intel's SHA extensions. You can get a 5x-6x speedup in the compress function using the CPU instructions. For example, proposed code for a crypto library witnessed the following (the test occurred on a Celeron J3455, which runs at 1.5 GHz, but bursts at 2.3 GHz):

C++ implementation

    $ ./botan speed --msec=3000 SHA-1 SHA-224 SHA-256
    SHA-160 [base] hash 274.826 MiB/sec (824.480 MiB in 3000.009 ms)
    SHA-224 [base] hash 92.349 MiB/sec (277.051 MiB in 3000.027 ms)
    SHA-256 [base] hash 92.364 MiB/sec (277.094 MiB in 3000.027 ms)


Intel SHA extensions

    $ ./botan speed --msec=3000 SHA-1 SHA-224 SHA-256
    SHA-160 [base] hash 1195.907 MiB/sec (3587.723 MiB in 3000.000 ms)
    SHA-224 [base] hash 535.740 MiB/sec (1607.219 MiB in 3000.000 ms)
    SHA-256 [base] hash 535.970 MiB/sec (1607.914 MiB in 3000.005 ms)

Here is the code for the SHA256 compress function using Intel SHA extensions with intrinsics. Its based on Sean Gulley's blog at Intel® SHA Extensions, and his sample code in mitls | hacl-star | experimental.
The compress function below only handles full blocks of 64-bytes. You need to setup the initial state, and you need to pad the last block. It looks like you have that covered in your sample code.

You can find source for both Intel SHA intrinsics and ARMv8 SHA intrinsics at Noloader GitHub | SHA-Intrinsics. They are C source files, and provide the compress function for SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256. The intrinsic based implementations increase throughput approximately 3x to 4x for SHA-1, and approximately 6x to 12x for SHA-224 and SHA-256.

","No decent cryptographic hash function is case insensitive, because then it would be far easier to produce a collision. The output is a different matter. It's basically a large number (so casing does not apply), but for convenience it is given in base 16, i.e. using the letters a through f as additional digits. Hexadecimal notation is indeed case insensitive, or at least both upper- and lowercase variants are common and recognized. It doesn't matter and does not change what number is represented.

","I'm using PowerShell 4.0 and I just encountered the same problem of null output from Get-FileHash. The cause of my problem is different than the OP but I have found a solution to my problem and I figured I would post my findings for anyone who came to this page trying to solve the problem of null output (or seemingly incorrect output) from Get-FileHash.
The problem only happens (for me) when the path to the target file contains brackets [ ] and those brackets contain either zero characters or 2 or more characters.
EDIT: I now understand WHY this happens. The string is interpreted as Regular Expression (RegEx) so the square brackets [ ] take on their special RegEx meaning. The -LiteralPath tells PowerShell to interpret the string as a simple match (no RegEx).
Consider the following paths which refer to 4 existing text files (hypothetically):
C:\Test\My Text.txt
C:\Test\My [Text].txt
C:\Test\My [Te]xt.txt
C:\Test\My Text[].txt

The following command produces normal output:
Get-FileHash ""C:\Test\My Text.txt""

but there will be null output if using the following commands:
Get-FileHash ""C:\Test\My [Text].txt""
Get-FileHash ""C:\Test\My [Te]xt.txt""
Get-FileHash ""C:\Test\My Text[].txt""

This can be solved by using the -LiteralPath switch. For example:
Get-FileHash -LiteralPath ""C:\Test\My [Text].txt""

Variables are expanded normally when using the -LiteralPath switch. For example: 
(Get-ChildItem C:\Test).FullName | ForEach {
Get-FileHash -LiteralPath $_
}

If there is exactly 1 character between the brackets, the brackets will be ignored when using Get-FileHash.
Consider the following paths which refer to 3 existing text files (hypothetically), each with unique hash values: 
C:\Test\My Text.txt
C:\Test\My Tex[t].txt
C:\Test\My[ ]Text.txt

Get-FileHash interprets all three of the following commands in exactly the same way ( the path is interpreted as C:\Test\My Text.txt ) and therefore each command has the exact same output despite each file having it's own unique hash value:
Get-FileHash ""C:\Test\My Text.txt""
Get-FileHash ""C:\Test\My Tex[t].txt""
Get-FileHash ""C:\Test\My[ ]Text.txt""

P.S. I'm a very new programmer, please forgive me for any poor usage of terminology.

","Well, the very first thing you need to do is use a consistent string encoding. I've no idea what PHP will do, but ""jake"".getBytes() will use whatever your platform default encoding is for Java. That's a really bad idea. Using UTF-8 would probably be a good start, assuming that PHP copes with Unicode strings to start with. (If it doesn't, you'll need to work out what it is doing and try to make the two consistent.) In Java, use the overload of String.getBytes() which takes a Charset or the one which takes the name of a Charset. (Personally I like to use Guava's Charsets.UTF_8.)
Then persuade PHP to use UTF-8 as well.
Then output the Java result in hex. I very much doubt that the code you've given is the actual code you're running, as otherwise I'd expect output such as ""[B@e48e1b"". Whatever you're doing to convert the byte array into a string, change it to use hex.

","Jackpot - nothing in your title is a problem!
First, you probably aren't actually using BouncyCastle. Sun/Oracle Java 7 and 8 now includes an EC provider (earlier versions did not) and the one-arg form of getInstance uses the first available provider, which is normally SunEC unless you or someone has altered the provider list.
TO VERIFY A SIGNATURE: pass the same data to the verifying Signature.update() as you passed to the signing Signature.update(). Exactly the same, byte for byte. Pass the signature value only to Signature.verify(). Putting PrivateKey.toString() in the data is silly; this value is specific to the running Java process, so you'll have to send it to the receiving process (if different, as it normally should be) where it is useless and a waste of space.
TO USE A STATIC KEY: do just that. Create a keypair and store it someplace, then read it in and use it. The easiest secure (password protected) store is a Java KeyStore (JKS) file, but that requires a certificate chain (perhaps a dummy one) which is a nuisance to code yourself; fortunately the keytool utility with -genkeypair generates a keypair with a dummy selfsigned certificate, and for -keyalg ec -keysize 256 it uses the (very popular) secp256r1 curve. Also specify -alias name of your choice, -keystore filename, any names you like for the dummy cert, and passwords. To use a keypair from a JKS file:

use java.security.KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS"") to create a store object and pass .load(InputStream,char[]) a FileInputStream on the file, and the password.
use .getKey(String alias,char[] password) and cast to get the PrivateKey. Use for signing.
use .getCertificateChain(String alias)[0].getPublicKey() to get the PublicKey from the first (only) cert. Use for verifying.

Missed your edit, but hope this helps.
EDIT: I see you aren't storing unique hashes.
If you are looking up the user by password, you need to hash the password in your query the same way it was stored:
$salt = $your_salt;

$hashed_password = hash('sha256', $salt.$_POST['password']);

$sql= ""SELECT * FROM members WHERE username='$username' and password='$hashed_password'"";  

Otherwise, you could look up by unique username (not by password) and just compare the hashed input to the value of the stored password.

I'm very confused right now. How should my login_ac.php look like, if I should make it with the code I gave you in the top?

Just change the query to lookup by hashed password (the way you stored it).
$sql= ""SELECT * FROM members WHERE username='$username' and password='"".hash('sha256', $salt.$_POST['password']).""'"";  

You can remove the other validation and hashing - if you found the user then you know the input is valid.
Note that this only works when you know the way you're hashing the input is the exact same way you hashed the password upon creation.

Update: Going further
here
$sql= ""SELECT * FROM members WHERE username='$username' and password='$password'"";

You try to retrieve the row, where the username matches $username and the password matches $password. In the database the passwords are already hashed (and $password seems to be not defined at all), thus this query will never return any row.
$password = hash('sha256', $salt.$_POST['password']);
$username = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['username']);
$sql= ""SELECT * FROM members WHERE username='$username' and password='$password'"";
$result=mysql_query($sql);

$result should now contain the only user that matches the given credentials. Its now very easy

The Sign method in my SignatureSupportUtility class should be adequate to sign individual XML elements or the whole message, however I keep receiving a Cryptography exception claiming that the SHA-256 is not supported. I think this exception should not be valid observing that the RSAPKCS1SHA256SignatureDescription.cs is registered. However observing that the SignedXML class does not include the namespace for SHA-256 and only SHA-128 I am beginning to doubt if the SHA 256 is supported regardless of registration.
Could someone please advise me on how best to resolve my issue and be able to sign XML with an X.509 certificate via RSA SHA 256 algorithm?
","I am also looking at the Oasis ebms stuff. 
I cannot find the article I took this from but I used that class that is in 4.5:
public class RsaPkCs1Sha256SignatureDescription : SignatureDescription
{
    public RsaPkCs1Sha256SignatureDescription()
    {
        KeyAlgorithm = ""System.Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider"";
        DigestAlgorithm = ""System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256Managed"";
        FormatterAlgorithm = ""System.Security.Cryptography.RSAPKCS1SignatureFormatter"";
        DeformatterAlgorithm = ""System.Security.Cryptography.RSAPKCS1SignatureDeformatter"";
    }

    public override AsymmetricSignatureDeformatter CreateDeformatter(AsymmetricAlgorithm key)
    {
        var asymmetricSignatureDeformatter = (AsymmetricSignatureDeformatter) CryptoConfig.CreateFromName(DeformatterAlgorithm);
        asymmetricSignatureDeformatter.SetKey(key);
        asymmetricSignatureDeformatter.SetHashAlgorithm(""SHA256"");
        return asymmetricSignatureDeformatter;
    }

and then use something like this to sign (have edited some irrelevant bits out):
    public XmlElement SignDocument(XmlDocument doc, List<string> idsToSign)
    {
        CryptoConfig.AddAlgorithm(typeof(RsaPkCs1Sha256SignatureDescription), @""http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256"");

        var cspParams = new CspParameters(24) { KeyContainerName = ""XML_DISG_RSA_KEY"" };
        var key = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(cspParams);
        key.FromXmlString(_x509SecurityToken.Certificate.PrivateKey.ToXmlString(true));

        var signer = new SoapSignedXml(doc) { SigningKey = key };

        signer.SignedInfo.CanonicalizationMethod = SignedXml.XmlDsigExcC14NTransformUrl;

        var keyInfo = new KeyInfo();
        keyInfo.AddClause(new SecurityTokenReference(_x509SecurityToken, SecurityTokenReference.SerializationOptions.Embedded));

        signer.KeyInfo = keyInfo;
        signer.SignedInfo.SignatureMethod = ""http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256"";

        var cn14Transform = new XmlDsigExcC14NTransform();
        string referenceDigestMethod = ""http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256"";

        foreach (string id in idsToSign)
        {
            var reference = new Reference(""#"" + id);
            reference.AddTransform(cn14Transform);
            reference.DigestMethod = referenceDigestMethod;
            signer.AddReference(reference);
        }

        signer.ComputeSignature();

        return signer.GetXml();
    }

seems to work and verifies OK at the other end. Tested with Holodeck the other day and I think it failed on a timestamp that was missing from the signature elements.
However, the signing of attachments seems to be a real problem in .NET - I don't think the relevant transforms are supported at all.

My problem is based around the need to sign individual XML elements with X.509 certificate with the RSA SHA-256 algorithm. I have read many .NET posts on this topic and it appears that there is a solution originally developed in the CLR Security project RSAPKCS1SHA256SignatureDescription.cs class. RSAPKCS1SHA256SignatureDescription has of course since been incorporated into the .net runtime and as of .NET 4.5 is now available under the distributed binary System.Deployment.dll.

","Unfortunately Andrew's answer is not applicable when the private key cannot be exported.
I am using a smart-card and so far I have found no way of using SignedXML with SHA-256. This feature seems to be broken in the current implementation of RSACryptoServiceProvider.
The only solution in my opinion would be to switch from CSP to PKCS#11 and then use BouncyCastle.Net. And rewrite everything.

If it doesn't equal the sha256 being cracked, then it adds i a value (i=i+00.000001) and triess again. and so on and so on
","Producing all possible coordinates between 00.000000 and 99.999999 is easy enough:
from itertools import product
import hashlib

digits = '0123456789'

for combo in product(digits, repeat=16):
    coords = '{}.{} {}.{}'.format(
        ''.join(combo[:2]), ''.join(combo[2:8]),
        ''.join(combo[8:10]), ''.join(combo[10:]))
    hash = hashlib.sha256(coords).hexdigest()
    if hash == '3f1c756daec9ebced7ff403acb10430659c13b328c676c4510773dc315784e4e':
        print coords
        break

This'll brute-force all 10**16 (a big number) combinations. Sit back and relax, this'll take a while.
And by 'a while', we really mean not in your lifetime, or anyone else's. Just iterating over all possible combinations produced by product() takes a huge amount of time, as each added digit to try increases the time required by a factor of 10:
>>> from collections import deque
>>> from itertools import product
>>> from timeit import timeit
>>> digits = '0123456789'
>>> timeit(lambda: deque(product(digits, repeat=8), 0), number=5)
3.014396679995116
>>> timeit(lambda: deque(product(digits, repeat=9), 0), number=5)
30.99540744899423

If producing all possible combinations of 8 digits takes .8 seconds (4s divided by 5 repetitions), 9 digits takes 8 seconds, you can extrapolate from that that 10 digits takes almost 1.5 minutes, etc. Just producing all possible combinations of 16 digits takes 1 million (10 ** 6) times as much time as 10 digits, so 963 days or just onder 3 years to run those in a loop. You could split this task up across 2000 different processes on a large number of computers with enough cores in total to run those processes in parallel, to reduce that to under 12 hours.
Then the loop body itself takes about 2.4 seconds per million iterations:
>>> from random import choice
>>> combo = tuple(choice(digits) for _ in range(16))  # random combination for testing
>>> timeit(""""""\
... coords = '{}.{} {}.{}'.format(
...     ''.join(combo[:2]), ''.join(combo[2:8]),
...     ''.join(combo[8:10]), ''.join(combo[10:]))
... hash = hashlib.sha256(coords).hexdigest()
... if hash == '3f1c756daec9ebced7ff403acb10430659c13b328c676c4510773dc315784e4e': pass
... """""", 'from __main__ import combo; import hashlib')
2.3429908752441406

But you have 10 ** 10 (10 thousand million) more times work than that, totaling roughly 743 years of computation work. Even being able to run 20 thousand parallel processes won't reduce that to a reasonable number (that's still about 13.5 years of work).
Python is just not fast enough for this task. Using GPUs it should be possible to reach 500 million hashes per second (0.5 Gigahash / s), at which point you could run the above brute-force operation and find a solution in about 230 days on such a system. At a cost, of course, because such a rig would cost about $3000-$4000 a month to run! But with enough dedicated hardware you can certainly 'crack' the hash in 'humane' timeline.

","One of the common claims about hashes is that they discard information, therefore they cannot be reversed. There's infinite messages that have the same hash. You can't know which of the infinite messages that give the same hash is correct.
Of course in practice, a brute force attack often works - either because your search strategy is likely to find the real original message first (most messages with hash collisions are obviously wrong in some trivial way - e.g. the wrong format - and won't turn up in the search because of that) or because your attack needs a different message with the same hash anyway.
In your case, what you know about the message means there's less information in the message than (apparently) in the hash. Of course hashing doesn't create new information, so that means many hashes cannot occur for any co-ordinate strings. You have (with very high probability for good hash algorithms) a 1:1 relationship between possible hashes and possible messages. In principle, you have an encrypted form of your message which can be decrypted.
Many people would call me an idiot for saying this, of course. After all, you still have to find all the hashes for all the possible messages. That may be faster than some people think, but it's a long way from trivial.
It has already been pointed out that there are 10^16 possible combinations based on your co-ordinate format. One thing to check is whether all values for all those digits are possible (and equally probable). Using floating point arithmetic internally shouldn't be a problem - double precision floats aren't 8-digit decimals, but 53 bits of mantissa should be plenty to ensure all those decimal digits are fully in use. However, it may be worth checking that there's no other limitation that reduces the number of cases to check - the obvious one being the precision in how those co-ordinates are measured.
Even if certain digit values are less probable than others, that means ordering the search to check more likely values first will save a lot of time for crackers.

Sha256 in Objective-C for iPhone
I have read this..but i am not able to understand this..

where hash parameters is the array of arguments...
Can you write this as a method which will take the input string...?

","I'm not sure I fully understand your questions but if you're looking to create a hashed string you CAN pass in your parameters as arguments to a hash function.  
-(void)generateHashedString {

    NSString *key = @""Some random string"";
    //enter your objects you want to encode in the data object
    NSString *data = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@%@%@"", @""sha256"", hash_parameters, api_key];

    const char *cKey  = [key cStringUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding];
    const char *cData = [data cStringUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding];

    unsigned char cHMAC[CC_SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH];

    CCHmac(kCCHmacAlgSHA256, cKey, strlen(cKey), cData, strlen(cData), cHMAC);

    NSString *hash = [HMAC base64Encoding];

}

This will give you an NSString of hash that you can use to make your requests.  NSLog(@""%@"",hash); To see what you generated!
Make sure you #import <CommonCrypto/CommonHMAC.h> too

CCHmac(kCCHmacAlgSHA256, cKey, strlen(cKey), cData, strlen(cData), cHMAC);

// Now convert to NSData structure to make it usable again

What is hash1 used for?
","The hash calculation is documented at Block hashing algorithm.
Start there for the relatively simple basics.  The basic data structures are documented in Protocol specification - Bitcoin Wiki.  Note that the protocol definition (and the definition of work) more or less assumes that SHA-256 hashes are 256-bit little-endian values, rather than big-endian as the standard implies.  See also 
Getwork is more complicated and runs into more serious endian/byte ordering confusion.
First note that the getwork API is optimized to speed up the initial steps of mining.
The midstate and hash1 values are for these performance optimizations and can be ignored.  Just look at the ""data"".
And when a standard sha256 implementation is used, only the first 80 bytes (160 hex characters) of the ""data"" are hashed.
Unfortunately, the JSON data presented in the getwork data structure has different endian characteristics than what is needed for hashing in the block example above.
They all say to go to the source for the answer, but the C++ source can be big and confusing.  A simple alternative is the poold.py code.  There is discussion of it here: New mining pool for testing.  You only need to look at the first few lines of the ""checkwork"" routine, and the ""bufreverse"" and ""bytereverse"" functions, to get the byte ordering right.  In the end it is just a matter of doing a reversal of the bytes in each 32-bit segment of the data.  Yes - very odd.  But endian issues are tricky and can end up that way....
Some other helpful information on the way ""getwork"" works can be found in discussions at:

My best guess is that there's some additional buffering in the Mono implementation of the File.Read operation. Having recently looked into checksums on a large file, on a decent spec Windows machine you should expect roughly 6 seconds per Gb if all is running smoothly.
Oddly it has been reported in more than one benchmark test that SHA-512 is noticeably quicker than SHA-256 (see 3 below). One other possibility is that the problem is not in allocating the data, but in disposing of the bytes once read. You may be able to use TransformBlock (and TransformFinalBlock) on a single array rather than reading the stream in one big gulp—I have no idea if this will work, but it bears investigating.
The difference between hashcode and checksum is (nearly) semantics. They both calculate a shorter 'magic' number that is fairly unique to the data in the input, though if you have 4.6GB of input and 64B of output, 'fairly' is somewhat limited. 

A checksum is not secure, and with a bit of work you can figure out the input from enough outputs, work backwards from output to input and do all sorts of insecure things.
A Cryptographic hash takes longer to calculate, but changing just one bit in the input will radically change the output and for a good hash (e.g. SHA-512) there's no known way of getting from output back to input.

MD5 is breakable: you can fabricate an input to produce any given output, if needed, on a PC. SHA-256 is (probably) still secure, but won't be in a few years time—if your project has a lifespan measured in decades, then assume you'll need to change it. SHA-512 has no known attacks and probably won't for quite a while, and since it's quicker than SHA-256 I'd recommend it anyway. Benchmarks show it takes about 3 times longer to calculate SHA-512 than MD5, so if your speed issue can be dealt with, it's the way to go.
No idea, beyond those mentioned above. You're doing it right.

For a bit of light reading, see Crypto.SE: SHA51 is faster than SHA256?
Edit in response to question in comment
The purpose of a checksum is to allow you to check if a file has changed between the time you originally wrote it, and the time you come to use it. It does this by producing a small value (512 bits in the case of SHA512) where every bit of the original file contributes at least something to the output value. The purpose of a hashcode is the same, with the addition that it is really, really difficult for anyone else to get the same output value by making carefully managed changes to the file.
The premise is that if the checksums are the same at the start and when you check it, then the files are the same, and if they're different the file has certainly changed. What you are doing above is feeding the file, in its entirety, through an algorithm that rolls, folds and spindles the bits it reads to produce the small value.
As an example: in the application I'm currently writing, I need to know if parts of a file of any size have changed. I split the file into 16K blocks, take the SHA-512 hash of each block, and store it in a separate database on another drive. When I come to see if the file has changed, I reproduce the hash for each block and compare it to the original. Since I'm using SHA-512, the chances of a changed file having the same hash are unimaginably small, so I can be confident of detecting changes in 100s of GB of data whilst only storing a few MB of hashes in my database. I'm copying the file at the same time as taking the hash, and the process is entirely disk-bound; it takes about 5 minutes to transfer a file to a USB drive, of which 10 seconds is probably related to hashing.
Lack of disk space to store hashes is a problem I can't solve in a post—buy a USB stick?

MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 (Swift 3+)

These functions will hash either String or Data input with one of eight cryptographic hash algorithms.

The name parameter specifies the hash function name as a String
Supported functions are MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512

This example requires Common Crypto
It is necessary to have a bridging header to the project:
#import <CommonCrypto/CommonCrypto.h>
Add the Security.framework to the project.  


This function takes a hash name and String to be hashed and returns a Data:

name: A name of a hash function as a String  
string: The String to be hashed  
returns: the hashed result as Data  

func hash(name:String, string:String) -> Data? {
    let data = string.data(using:.utf8)!

I noticed some comment in the code about endianness so I looked it up and your system is also little-endian, so that shouldn't be a problem.  I'd advise you to look for a different implementation.

","While this question was asked almost a year ago, it has received some up votes recently which may indicate that some other people are getting the same problem. Hopefully this answer can help :)
Briefly speaking, the error doesn't happen in all machines but only in some of them. I guess it depends on what CSPs have been registered on a specific machine. Anyway, in my specific case, the certificate was generated with either ""Microsoft RSA SChannel..."" or ""Microsoft strong cryptographic provider"" as the CSP. I generated a new certificate but used ""Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider"" as the CSP and it SHA256 signing started working for me.

","Had the same problem with XmlDsig (trying to make enveloping signature of xml document with RSA-SHA256 algorithm).
First I were getting exception

System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException:
  SignatureDescription could not be created for the signature algorithm
  supplied.

Then I found mention of RSAPKCS1SHA256SignatureDescription - signature description implementation for RSA-SHA256 signatures.
Full implementation here: http://clrsecurity.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/47833#269110
or here: https://gist.github.com/sneal/f35de432115b840c4c1f
You have to manually call once per appdomain:
CryptoConfig.AddAlgorithm(typeof(RSAPKCS1SHA256SignatureDescription), ""http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256"");

After that I got a new exception:

System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException: Invalid algorithm
  specified.

This brought me to your question. After reading suggested article I have made a new key and certificate (with OpenSSL) using Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider.
To my surprise, this new certificate allowed me to successfully make a signature.
After some more investigation I have found interesting answer of Andrew here https://stackoverflow.com/a/17285774/328785, where he used RSACryptoServiceProvider to prepare SecretKey for SignedXml class.
Specifically this part (my interpretation):
var store = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.CurrentUser);
store.Open(OpenFlags.OpenExistingOnly | OpenFlags.ReadOnly);
var certificates =  store.Certificates.Find(X509FindType.FindBySerialNumber,  ""54dba096"", true);
var certificate = certificates[0];

// next three lines
var cspParams = new CspParameters(24) { KeyContainerName = ""XML_DSIG_RSA_KEY"" };
var key = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(cspParams);
key.FromXmlString(certificate.PrivateKey.ToXmlString(true));

SignedXml sxml = new SignedXml(doc);
sxml.SigningKey = key;

And this solutions worked fine even with old key!

","Despite this question being quite old, I am pretty sure someone is bound to encounter it sooner or later.
Lately, we have been dealing with service that runs on a server that only supports TLS 1.2 and has SHA-1 hashing algorithm disabled. We need to sign entire pain.something.something file, which renders the most popular answer useless.
Here is what we found out:

If you use certificate private key as SigningKey, you can only use SHA-1 algorithm for signatures.
You need to obtain private key using GetRSAPrivateKey method.
You need to set SignatureMethod of signedXML to SecurityAlgorithms.RsaSha256Signature
You need to set DigestMethod of reference object to SecurityAlgorithms.Sha256Digest.

Then, you are good to go.
Here is also a sample code that does this:
private static void SignXmlDocumentEx(XmlElement el, X509Certificate2 cert)
{
    var dataId = string.Format(""Signature-{0}"", Guid.NewGuid());
    var signedXml = new System.Security.Cryptography.Xml.SignedXml(el);
    signedXml.SigningKey = cert.GetRSAPrivateKey();
    signedXml.SignedInfo.SignatureMethod = SecurityAlgorithms.RsaSha256Signature;
    signedXml.Signature.Id = dataId;
    var reference = new Reference(dataId);
    reference.AddTransform(new XmlDsigEnvelopedSignatureTransform());
    reference.Uri = """";
    reference.DigestMethod = SecurityAlgorithms.Sha256Digest;
    signedXml.AddReference(reference);
    signedXml.KeyInfo = new KeyInfo();
    signedXml.KeyInfo.AddClause(new KeyInfoX509Data(cert, X509IncludeOption.EndCertOnly));
    signedXml.ComputeSignature();
    el.AppendChild(signedXml.GetXml());
}

I am also trying to use RSAPKCS1SignatureDeformatter's VerifySignature method. But not really sure what are the two parameters to be passed.

The need is similar to how Scons (build system) hashes command-lines and source files, and how Git (version control system) hashes files to compute a signature for storage/synchronization.
Recall that Scons uses MD5, and Git uses SHA-1.

seems to be currently recommended for new work (but
""stronger"" algorithm strength is not
specifically required for my
application)

","Yes, I would use SHA-256. SHA-256 had a lot more than security purposes in mind; in fact one of the reasons that SHA1 needed to be replaced was for the very reason you need a hash function. A hash algorithm produces a finite site output; while having an undetermined amount of input. Eventually there will be a collision. The larger the output; the less likely of a collision (when using a proper hash algorithm).
Git went with SHA1 because they use it as file names; and they wanted it to be small and compact. SHA256 produces a much larger digest; consuming more disk space and more data to transmit over the wire. This question specifically addresses what would happen if git were to encounter collisions.
To look at your points:

SHA256 has been in the wild long enough that if there were problems; we should have seen them by now.
It isn't ""stronger"" per-se, it's less likely to produce a collision (if that is your criteria for stronger; then yes it is stronger).
SHA-256 is slower; yes. Much slower? Depends on what your needs are. For 95% of people; it's performance is acceptable assuming you're using a proper implementation.
In general, truncating the hash of SHA2 is an okay thing to do.

","Depends on what you're doing.  It takes a lot longer to compute SHA-256 hash.  Not a big deal for many applications, but what if your app were trying to compute hundreds or thousands per minute?  You might find the additional time is too much.
On the flip-side though, SHA-1 has a much higher chance of a collision than SHA-256.  Understand though that such chances are miniscule (1 in 2^160/2 I think for SHA-1) and likely would never be hit by most apps.  However, the more things you hash, the higher the chance.

","The probability of a non-malicious collision is vanishingly small, even with MD5. Here is a thought experiment:
A well stuffed hard drive may have 1M files. For the experiment, imagine there are 10M files. Let's say that the world population is 10.000M persons, each with one computer, and every file is different.
We would be contending with a number of different files of 10E6 * 10E9 = 1E17,  < 2^57
The probability of an MD5 collision in such a far fetched case would be less than 1 in 2^71, or less than one in aproximately 2E21! To put this in perspective, for a collision probability of 1 in 10M we would have to repeat the experiment roughly 2E14 times, which is to say replacing every file, every hour since the big bang, and then keep going for a few more billion years.
2E14 / 24 / 365 / 13500E6 = 1.69
Of course, with SHA1 or SHA256, the probabilities would be even smaller, and there would also be resistance to a malicious attack -- unlike MD5, it would not be possible (now) that someone constructed files purposely for having the same hash.

","For increased security (however this might be defined) with reduced opportunities for attackers or accidents you might want to consider salting or using keyed (HMAC) variants. Also small tricks like Git's prefix which includes the message length or a CRC can make it harder for an attacker to device a message not only having the same hash, but also a valid format.
You can also think about larger hashes like the trees used by Glacier (Amazon) or Branch Cache Hash (Microsoft) or some peer-to-peer networks like BitTorrent or other Merkle or Tiger Tree based constructs.

","Just to clarify, SHA is a hashing algorithm, which is (generally) a one way street.  You can't decrypt hashes, which is kind of the strength of using them to authenticate passwords.  You're on the right track with moving to a salted hash, and here's how I would do it.
The only way you're getting passwords is to let the user type it in themselves.  As users visit your site and log in, update the passwords one by one.  In your authentication method, I would perform the hash you're doing now, and compare it against what's in the existing field (nothing new here).  Assuming it matches, go ahead and salt / re-hash using SHA256, and update the password field in the database.  If you want, keep a bit in your user table tracking which users have been updated.  
I'm making a lot of assumptions, but this is how I've solved the hash algorithm dance in the past.  Good luck!

","The usual way of going about this is this:

Make the hashed-password column larger to accommodate a sha256 hash, and add a 'salt' column
Set the salt field to NULL initially, and adjust your password-check code so that a NULL salt means sha1, and non-NULL means sha256
Once a sha1-use has logged in successfully, re-hash the password to sha256 with salt, and update the database.

Over time, users will migrate to sha256 by themselves; the only problem are users who log in only very sporadically or not at all. For these, you may want to send a reminder e-mail, or even threaten to shut their account down if they don't log in before day X (don't give the actual reason though...)

"6971316","Want to Convert a Website password Encryption from SHA1 to SHA256","just looking for some advise.
I have a website with around 2500 users - small but growing.
I built it with using SHA1 encryption on the passwords.
I've since read the SHA1 is insecure and would like to change to say SHA256 with a Salt.
Does anyone have any advice on how to make a transition like this?
Would be great if I could decrypt the passwords and just re-hash them but it doesn't appear doing able.

","I have another suggestion to migrate your password hash from SHA1 to SHA256 immediately without waiting for user to visit the site again to rehash the password. The change will be one time password hash migration and change to your logon validation function. 
Suppose your password hash are generated using the function: password + salt [Sha1]-> Hash-sha1
To migrate to Sha256, you may convert your password hash using the following algorithm:
Hash-sha1 + salt [Sha256]-> Hash-sha256   (The salt is used to increase the complexity of input.)
Depending on the acceptable value of your sha256 function, you can consider to encode the Hash-sha1 to base64 for printable ascii.
For your logon validation function, the password should be hashed using the following algorithm:
Password + salt [sha1] -> hash-sha1 + salt [sha 256] -> hash-sha256
The disadvantage is hashed twice (use some CPU time) but simplify the migration and better security.

","Switching to SHA256 will hardly make your website more secure.
SHA1 and SH512 are message digests, they were never meant to be password-hashing (or key-derivation) functions. (Although a message digest could be used a building block for a KDF, such as in PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA1.)
A password-hashing function should defend against dictionary attacks and rainbow tables.
Currently, the only standard (as in sanctioned by NIST) password-hashing or key-derivation function is PBKDF2. Better choices, if using a standard is not required, are bcrypt and the newer scrypt. Wikipedia has pages for all three functions:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt

The page at https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm contains an extensive discussion of password security.
This being said, tdhammers offers good advice regarding how to handle the migration.

So, any help?
","That's because you are always calling the same static method, SHA256.Create. SHA256 is an abstract class and its descendants do not provide an alternate method. In fact, Resharper will give you a warning that you are accessing a static member from a derived type.
In fact, calling SHA256.Create is the same as calling HashAlgorithm.Create. Both classes call the same implementation internally and simply cast the result to different types.
The SHA256.Create method will create the default implementation that is specified in machine.config and can be overriden in your app.config
If you want to use a specific provider, use SHA256.Create(string) passing the name of the provider you want to use.
Examples are:
SHA256.Create(""System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256Cng"");
HashAlgorithm.Create(""System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256Cng"");
SHA256.Create(""System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256CryptoServiceProvider"");

EDIT
The documentation of HashAlgorithm.Create specifies a list of valid algorithm names. The MSDN article Mapping Algorithm Names to Cryptography Classes describes how you can map algorithm names to other providers (your own, third-party, hardware-accelerated or whatever) and use them instead of the default algorithms. 
EDIT 2
It is also possible to change the mappings programmatically. So, to map ""Dog"" to the SHA512CryptoServiceProvider, you just need to write:
CryptoConfig.AddAlgorithm(
             typeof(System.Security.Cryptography.SHA512CryptoServiceProvider),
             ""Dog"");
var t4 = HashAlgorithm.Create(""Dog"");

","You could simply compare the two password strings passwordA.equals(passwordB) ...
This has some security shortcomings:

Passwords should not be handled as strings, but as char or byte arrays: see here why
An Equal comparison is (theoretically) vulnerable to a timing-attack: see a discussion about a solution in java
It might be wise to use standard-tool to do security related things (even when they seem to be simple). Spring security has a ton of tools that can do that for you.

 BCryptPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new BCryptPasswordEncoder();

","I can't comment on the correctness of the VB, but from the obviousness of the naming, I can say it looks correct.
So there's not enough information here to say whats wrong; and you've likely said everything you know.  Therefore, the people to verify this for you would be your third party.  They'd be able to say what was wrong.
PS: strange that there is no nonce sent by the other party as a challenge?

","You can trivially convert any array ([size]T) to a slice ([]T) by slicing it:
x := [32]byte{}
slice := x[:] // shorthand for x[0:len(x)]

From there you can compare it to your slice like you would compare any other two slices, e.g.
func Equal(slice1, slice2 []byte) bool {
    if len(slice1) != len(slice2) {
        return false
    }

    for i := range slice1 {

","Don't do this:
byte[] bytes = data.getBytes();

That will use the platform default encoding to convert a string to a byte array. That can vary between platform, whereas you want something repeatable. I would suggest UTF-8:
byte[] bytes = data.getBytes(""UTF-8"");

(Do the same for the key, of course.)
You should then use the same encoding in your C# - not ASCII, unless you really want to not handle non-ASCII characters.
byte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data);

It's also not clear how you're comparing the results afterwards - don't forget that byte is signed in Java, but unsigned in C#. It's probably simplest to convert the hash to hex or base64 for comparison purposes.
EDIT: I strongly suspect the last part was the problem - comparing the results.
Here are two short but complete programs (using the iharder.net base64 converter in Java) which produce the same base64 output:

The latest version of OpenSSL seems to be 1.0.2, but the source available at https://www.openssl.org/source/ does not seem to be compilable for OS X, since the file ""Install.MacOS"" says right at the beginning:
""Thanks to Roy Wood  initial support for Mac OS (pre
X) is now provided.""
My try to install it nevertheless resulted in some errors on the command line.
Can anyone tell me if it is somehow possible to use the SHA-256 signature algorithm with an OpenSSL installation on Yosemite? It seems odd to me if this would not be possible, but I am no expert in this field.
Hoping for a good hint!
","Finally found out how to do it:

Install homebrew (see http://brew.sh/index.html) with command
ruby -e ""$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)""
Install newest openssl version with command brew install openssl
Run brew link --force openssl in terminal, open a new one and run which openssl in it -> will show you /usr/local/bin/openssl 
Tada! Now if you run openssl version it will show OpenSSL 1.0.2 22 Jan 2015 (if you didn't run brew link --force openssl before it would have shown OpenSSL 0.9.8zc 15 Oct 2014)

:)
(Found hints on Update OpenSSL on OS X with Homebrew, didn't know about homebrew before or that I needed it to get the up-to-date openssl running.

Can anyone tell me if it is somehow possible to use the SHA-256 signature algorithm with an OpenSSL installation on Yosemite? 

Yes, but you need to install a more recent version OpenSSL. OS X's 0.9.8 lacks elliptic curve support (among other things).


The latest version of OpenSSL seems to be 1.0.2, but the source available at https://www.openssl.org/source/ does not seem to be compilable for OS X, since the file ""Install.MacOS"" says right at the beginning:

Ignore that because its wrong.
See the OpenSSL wiki on Compilation and Installation. The 30 second fly-by on 64-bit OS X:
export KERNEL_BITS=64
cd openssl
./config shared no-ssl2 no-ssl3 no-comp enable-ec_nistp_64_gcc_128 --openssldir=/usr/local
make all
sudo make install

Ignore the prompt about make depend since you don't need it.

Related: if you want to build a fat OpenSSL, then see this question: Build Multiarch OpenSSL on OS X. The short answer is, don't try because it won't work due to OpenSSL makefiles.
If you want a fat library, the perform the following steps:
export KERNL_BITS=64
./configure ...
...

mv libcrypto.a libcrypto-x86_64.a 
mv libssl.a libssl-x86_64.a

make clean && make dclean
export KERNL_BITS=32
./configure ...
...

mv libcrypto.a libcrypto-i386.a 
mv libssl.a libssl-i386.a

lipo -create libcrypto-x86_64.a libcrypto-i386.a -output libcrypto.a
lipo -create libssl-x86_64.a libssl-i386.a -output libssl.a

sudo make install

Lather, rinse and repeat for the dylibs before running make install. Note: i386 should not use enable-ec_nistp_64_gcc_128 (IIRC).

When you need to use OpenSSL in your programs, you will use /usr/local/ssl/include as a header path, and /usr/local/ssl/lib as a library path.
As a matter of fact, I don't use library paths because OS X's linker ignores your request for static linking. I use static linking to avoid LD_PRELOAD and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH problems and tricks (like compiling against 1.0.2 in /usr/local/ssl, but loading 0.9.8 at runtime in /usr/lib). So my compile like looks something like:
gcc foo.c bar.c /usr/local/ssl/lib/libcrypto.a -o foobar.exe

An archive is a collection of object files (*.o), so you specify them just like any other object file.

","But is it worth it? If you have a hash for each file, then you essentially have an overhead for each file. Let's say that each file must take up at least 512 bytes (a typical disk sector) and that you're storing these hashes compactly enough so as to not have each hash take up much more than the hash size.
So, even if all your files are 512 bytes, the smallest, you're talking either 16 / 512 = 3.1% or 32 / 512 = 6.3%. In reality, I'd bet your average file size is higher (unless all your files are 1 sector...), so that overhead would be less.
Now, the amount of space you need for hashes scales linearly with the number of files you have. Is that extra space worth that much? Even if you had your mentioned trillion files - that's 1 000 000 000 000 * 16 = ~29 TiB, which is a lot of space, but keep in mind: your data would be 1 000 000 000 000 * 512 = 465 TiB. The numbers are worthless, really, since it's still 3% or 6% overhead. But at this level, where you have a half petabyte of storage, does 15 terabytes matter? At any level, does a 3% savings mean anything? And remember, if they're larger, you save less. (Which, they probably are: good luck getting a 512 byte sector size at that hard disk size.)
So, is this 3% or less disk savings worth the potential risk in security. (Which I'll leave unanswered, as it's waaay not my cup of tea.)
Alternatively, could you, say, group files together in some logical fashion, so that you have less files? (I mean, if you have trillions of 512 byte files, do you really want to hash every byte on disk?)

","Yeah that will work. Theoretically it's better to XOR the two halves together but even truncated SHA256 is stronger than MD5. You should still consider the result a 128 bit hash rather than a 256 bit hash though.
My particular recommendation in this particular case is to store and reference using HASH + uniquifier where uniquifier is the count of how many distinct files you've seen with this hash before. This way you don't absolutely fall down flat if somebody tries to store future discovered collision vectors for SHA256.

In the environment I'm using I can't use nodejs, so no require('crypto') ... or at least I do not know of a way of using it outside node.
I'm following the example guide here: http://pusher.com/docs/rest_api; I'm stuck in the part 
where it says I should generate the HMAC SHA256 hex digest.
I am using this library http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/#HMAC

Do you spot any errors in what I did? Do you have a library to suggest?
Thanks in advance for any help.
","I was struggling with doing the exact same thing. Pusher's documentation should really be clearer about this issue. It turns out it's not the encyption methods. It's the order that you list your parameters. The body of your message has to be exactly formatted like this:
{""data"":""{\""message\"":\""hello world\""}"",""name"":""my_event"",""channel"":""test_channel""}
Data has to be first, then message, followed by name and then finally the channel name.
Then when you create your auth signature you have to list your parameters as so:
POST\n/apps/3/events\nauth_key=278d425bdf160c739803&auth_timestamp=1353088179&auth_version=1.0&body_md5=ec365a775a4cd0599faeb73354201b6f
So auth key is first, then the timestamp, followed by the auth version and finally the body md5.
I got it to work once I followed this exact pattern. Hopefully this helps!

","SHA256 returns pure binary output, with all values from 00 to FF essentially equally likely for each character.
For text output, you'll need to convert it to a text form, like Base64 encoding
byte[] encodedBytes = Base64.encodeBase64(""Test"".getBytes());
System.out.println(""encodedBytes "" + new String(encodedBytes));

The only way to go from a cryptographically sound hash (or most hashes, even cryptographically unsound ones) back to the original input is to apply the hash to input after input until you get the same result - that's either the original input, or a collision.

"3444503","Glassfish Security - jdbcRealm: How to configure login with SHA-256 digest","I use jdbcRealm for security in my glassfish v3.0.1 b22. It is set up so that it use the USER table inside my database for authentication by following this blog: http://blogs.oracle.com/foo/entry/mort_learns_jdbc_realm_authentication. I got it working fine, if I leave the digest algorithm as plain text. However when i try to use SHA-256 for digest algorithm, it stop working. 
What I did is specify in Glassfish - Security - Realm - jdbcRealm - digest that I want SHA-256 (I just type SHA-256 inside digest field). Then I wrote a simple Java program to convert password text into SHA-256 hash. I then paste that hash inside my password field in the database. By the way, password field is type varchar(30). I cant log in anymore. One thing I notice that my simple Java program generated different hash every time for the same text field.
Below are my simple java program:
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");
        String text = ""admin"";
        md.update(text.getBytes(""UTF-8""));
        byte[] digest = md.digest();
        System.out.println(digest.toString());

","The jdbcRealm allows encoding values of hex or base64. You need to specify one of these in your realm configuration and in your code, convert the byte array into one of these formats:
Base64:
import com.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.security.utils.Base64;
...
byte[] digest = md.digest();
System.out.println(Base64.encode(digest));

Hex:
...
byte[] digest = md.digest();
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
for (int i = 0; i < digest.length; i++) {
    String hex = Integer.toHexString(0xff & digest[i]);
    if (hex.length() == 1) sb.append('0');
    sb.append(hex);
}
System.out.println(sb.toString());


btw, password field is type varchar(30)

You'll need to increase the size of your password field. SHA-256 base64 and hex values are 45 and 64 characters in length, respectively.

","I'm still unclear whether you want SHA-1 or SHA-256, so let's abstract the problem; firstly, an encode method to take a byte[] and return the hex (don't worry, you already wrote it; but I would prefer a StringBuilder over String concatenation. Java String is immutable, so you're creating garbage for later garbage collection with +) -
private static String encodeHex(byte[] digest) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = 0; i < digest.length; i++) {
        sb.append(Integer.toString((digest[i] & 0xff) + 0x100, 16).substring(1));
    }
    return sb.toString();
}

Next, we can create a method that takes the algorithm name and the String to digest and returns that digest. Like
public static String digest(String alg, String input) {
    try {
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(alg);
        byte[] buffer = input.getBytes(""UTF-8"");
        md.update(buffer);
        byte[] digest = md.digest();
        return encodeHex(digest);
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException | UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return e.getMessage();
    }
}

Then we can get a SHA-1 or a SHA-256 hash like
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(digest(""SHA1"", """"));
    System.out.println(digest(""SHA-256"", """"));
}

Which outputs (as expected)

","You don't 'decrypt' the hashes because hashing is not encryption.
As for undoing the hash function to get the original string, there is no way to go from hash to original item, as hashing is a one-direction action. You can take an item and get a hash, but you can't take the hash and get the original item.
Make a note that hashes should NOT be confused with encryption; encryption is a different process where you can take an item, encrypt it with some type of key (either preshared or symmetric keys like PGP keys), and then later decrypt it.  Hashes do not work that way.

In comments, you indicate that you're trying to save a passcode in the database.  The problem is, you don't want someone who can breach the DB to be immediately be able to decrypt passcodes, which is why hashing is so attractive.
The idea, then, is that you would consider using salted hashes, storing only the salt on a per-user basis in the DB as its own record, and then store the salted hash of their original password string in the database.
Then, to verify a password is entered proper, get the salt from the DB, get the user input for a given password, and then using the salt from the DB, get the salted hash for that input.  Take that resultant hash and compare it to the salted hash stored in the DB.  If they match, you have a validated password; if they don't match, it's invalid.
This way, there's actually no decryption of any passwords readily doable, which means in a data breach situation of your site the passwords are not easily able to be retrieved.  (This doesn't rule out someone breaching your database, copying down the data, and trying to brute-force the passwords, but depending on what you enforce for password complexity and the effort a hacker wants to actually go through to get credentials, this is less likely to happen)
I'd write an example of this in a language I understand, but as you don't define what language you're working with, it's not going to be possible for me to write a useful example for you here.
That said, if you're working with PHP, you may find this document on crackstation.net about doing secure salted password hashing properly; there's already PHP implementations to do this proper so you wouldn't have to write your own code, supposedly.

What is the issue? Will the shorter length output impact security?
","Base-64 is 6 bits per character (2^6 = 64).
256 bits / 6 bits per char = 42.6666 char

And that has obviously ended up as 44 due to padding (you will see one or 2 = on the end of the output).
You must be expecting base-16 (AKA hexadecimal) which is 4 bits per character (2^4 = 16). 
256 bits / 4 bits per char = 64 char

For hex use this:
return BitConverter.ToString(bytes).Replace(""-"", string.Empty);

","First of all, for those wondering, this is in reference to my answer to this question: Objective-C sample code for HMAC-SHA1

The HMAC you generate is a 256-bit binary value that may or may not start with a 0 byte.
To be able to print it, you need a string representation (binary, hex, decimal, base64, etc.). Base64 is one of the most efficient among these, that's why I used a Base64 encoding there.
The reason you get garbage is that most (if not all) of the octets in the HMAC value are outside the range of printable ASCII characters. If the first octet is 0 (0x00), you get nil. This is why you need an encoding that supports arbitrary values. ASCII doesn't.
Of course, if you don't want to print the HMAC value, then may not need such an encoding, and can keep the HMAC as is (binary NSData).

        //                final Charset asciiCs = Charset.forName( ""utf-8"" );
        Mac mac;
        String result = """";
        try
        {
            byte[] bytesKey = PayboxConstants.KEY.getBytes( );
            final SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec( bytesKey, ""HmacSHA512"" );
            mac = Mac.getInstance( ""HmacSHA512"" );
            mac.init( secretKey );
            final byte[] macData = mac.doFinal( datas.getBytes( ) );
            byte[] hex = new Hex( ).encode( macData );
            result = new String( hex, ""ISO-8859-1"" );
        }
        catch ( final NoSuchAlgorithmException e )
        {
            AppLogService.error( e );
        }
        catch ( final InvalidKeyException e )
        {
            AppLogService.error( e );
        }
        catch ( UnsupportedEncodingException e )
        {
            AppLogService.error( e );
        }

        return result.toUpperCase( );

    }

But it does not makes the job because for same input (ABC) its ouput is:
AA6492987D7A7AC81109E877315414806F1973CC47B897ECE713171A25A11B279329B1BFF39EA72A5EFB7EDCD71D1F34D5AAC49999A780BD13F019ED99685B80

I've tries a lot of other java code but none of them was an exact clone of php version.
What did I do wrong?
","You simply forgot to mimic pack()'s behavior in your Java code (whatever you need that for). 
Use
final SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec( DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary(PayboxConstants.KEY), ""HmacSHA512"" );

In your Java Code.
Where DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary() is from the JAXB API.
Alternatively, if you don't want to include JAXB just for the purpose of converting HEX strings to bytes, you might want to use the code posted here.

","According to online SHA-256 hash calculator and a base-64 to hex decoder, it is the .NET implementation that has not calculated the hash correctly. You may want to double check the parameters you pass to the hashing functions.
When you are dealing with two untrusted implementations, it is always a good idea to find another independent implementation, and choose the one that matches the third one as correct. Either that, or find some test vectors, and validate the implementations individually.

EDIT:
A quick experiment shows that the SHA-256 hash you get from .NET matches the hext string 3400340034003400330033003300330032003200320032003100310031003100 - little endian 16-bit characters. Make sure you pass in ASCII.

","Adam Liss had it right when he mentioned the byte arrays between strings in .NET/SQL Server are different than strings in Javascript. The array in .NET for the string 4444333322221111 would look like [52 0 52 0 52 0 52 0 51 0 51 0... etc.] and the same thing in Javascript would just look like [52 52 52 52 51 51 51 51...]. Thus, with different byte arrays, different hashes were generated.
I was able to remedy this for my application by modifying the base 64 SHA-256 hashing algorithm from here, where each character is pulled from the string one at a time in order to generate the hash.
Rather than having it do it this way, I first converted the string into a unicode-like byte array (like the .NET example above, 52 0 52 0 etc), fed that array to the hashing algorithm instead of the string, and did some very minor tweaks in order for it to grab each array member to generate the hash. Low and behold, it worked and now I have a very convenient method of hashing CC numbers in the same fashion as the .NET framework for quick and easy order lookup.

","I know this question is quite old but I figured I'd share what I know anyways.
You can do this more easily by doing what I discuss in this answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/17848266/2226207
Basically you can include components/lib-typedarrays-min.js and then do the following in code.
var reader = new FileReader();

// If we use onloadend, we need to check the readyState.
reader.onloadend = function(evt) {
  if (evt.target.readyState == FileReader.DONE) { // DONE == 2

    var wordArray = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(e.target.result);
    var hash = CryptoJS.SHA256(wordArray);
  }
};

var blob = file.slice(start, stop + 1);
reader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob);

I haven't tested the above solution but it should work fine.

","Here is a simple solution found : https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/issues/detail?id=62

When you pass a string to a hasher, it's converted to bytes using UTF-8. That's to ensure foreign characters are not clipped. Since you're working with binary data, you'll want to convert the string to bytes using Latin1.

"7909288","PHP / Javascript / JQuery - base64 sha256 encoding","I'm trying to port a PHP example of an API integration to Javascript / JQuery. In PHP, an encrypted string is created using the following code:
$sig = base64_encode(hash_hmac('sha256', $sign, $this->secretAccessKey, true)

whose functions are documented here:
http://php.net/manual/en/function.hash-hmac.php
http://us.php.net/base64_encode
In Javascript, I'm using JQuery's crypto to do the HMAC piece:
http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/#HMAC-SHA256

and I'm trying to figure out if I also need to do a base64 encode, as it seems it is already in base64. This is the code I'm currently running:
var sigHash = Crypto.HMAC(Crypto.SHA256, sign, accessKey);

Is this correct? How would I create a javascript / jquery equivalent of the above PHP function?
","HMAC is a standard. So is SHA-256. So their outputs, regardless of which implementation, has to be the same.
There could only be differences in the Base64 encoding. Normally, the non-alphanumeric characters are + and /, but you cannot count on that. I've checked, and both implementations use the same non-alphanumeric characters.
However, you should still ""manually"" check a few thousand strings. The implementation in PHP is well tested. But I do not know if the same is true for the implementation in jQuery...
The syntax for Base64 encoded output is:
Crypto.util.bytesToBase64(

var sigHash = Crypto.HMAC(Crypto.SHA256, sign, accessKey);

Is this correct? How would I create a javascript / jquery equivalent of the above PHP function?

","I'm pretty sure that you're dealing with the new RedSys SHA256 signature implementation. Also I saw that you have some issue with the 3DES encryption between PHP and C#.
First at all you must get the base 64 string with all the payment parameters. You can achieve it with this code:
public static string GetParameters(string merchantCode, string terminal, int currency, string transactionType, decimal amount, string merchantOrder, string merchantIdentifier, string merchantPost, string urlOk, string urlKo)
        {
            var jsonValues = new Dictionary<string, string>
            {
                { ""Ds_Merchant_Amount"", amount.ToString().Replace(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.NumberFormat.NumberDecimalSeparator, """") },
                { ""Ds_Merchant_Order"", merchantOrder},
                { ""Ds_Merchant_MerchantCode"", merchantCode },
                { ""Ds_Merchant_Currency"", currency.ToString() },
                { ""Ds_Merchant_TransactionType"", transactionType },
                { ""Ds_Merchant_Terminal"", terminal },
                { ""Ds_Merchant_Identifier"", merchantIdentifier },
                { ""Ds_Merchant_MerchantURL"", merchantPost },
                { ""Ds_Merchant_UrlOK"", urlOk},
                { ""Ds_Merchant_UrlKO"",  urlKo}
            }.Select(kvp => ""\""{0}\"":\""{1}\"""".Formato(kvp.Key.ToUpper(), kvp.Value));

            var jsonString = ""{"" + string.Join("","", jsonValues) + ""}"";

            return Convert.ToBase64String(ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(jsonString));
        }

Once you have the JSON string in base 64, you must apply 3DES to merchant order parameter with the key provided by RedSys:
public static string GetTransactionEncryptionKey(string merchantOrder, string encryptKey)
        {
            using (var tdes = new TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider())
            {
                tdes.IV = new byte[8] { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
                tdes.Key = Convert.FromBase64String(encryptKey);
                tdes.Padding = PaddingMode.Zeros;
                tdes.Mode = CipherMode.CBC;

                var toEncrypt = ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(merchantOrder);
                var result = tdes.CreateEncryptor().TransformFinalBlock(toEncrypt, 0, toEncrypt.Length);

                return Convert.ToBase64String(result);
            }
        }

As you can see, the encryption key provided by RedSys is base 64 string so you don't need to calculate the MD5 hash for the 3DES algorithm.
Then we go for the SHA256 signature:
public static string GetSignature(string base64Parameters, string base64tranEncryptKey)
        {
            using (var sha = new HMACSHA256(Convert.FromBase64String(base64tranEncryptKey)))
            {
                var hash = sha.ComputeHash(ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(base64Parameters));

                return Convert.ToBase64String(hash);
            }
        }

","Typical PKI systems use Certificate Authorities to issue certificates to subjects (by signing them). By signing Certificate Authority forms a chain from the CA to the subject's certificate, this chain can contain multiple CA's if CA1 (root CA) sings CA2's (intermediate CA) certificate which in turn sings the subject's certificate. This is very common on the Internet (for SSL/TLS) and in digital signature scenarios.
So you most likely need at least one CA's certificate and it's public key to verify the subject's certificate. Your program can support multiple independent CA's as well. The CA's your program accepts are usually called Trust Anchors. Keeping the Trust Anchors in a KeyStore is also very convenient.
So, you'll probably end up with a KeyStore containing the Trust Anchors and intermediate CA's. From there on you'll need to form the chain and validate the signatures of all certificates in the chin from the root CA (Trust Anchor) to the subject's certificate that you're trying to validate.
For a proper certificate validation you'll need to check other things besides the chain's signature such as key usage, basic constraints, revocation information, etc. All of this is specified in the RFC5280 in Certificate Path Validation.
Luckily, there is already Java API in the form of CertPath API that can help you with that. A very rudimentary example that could fit your use case would be:
final CertificateFactory certificateFactory = CertificateFactory.getInstance(""X.509"");

final X509Certificate certificateToCheck = (X509Certificate) certificateFactory.generateCertificate(new ByteArrayInputStream(certBytes));

final KeyStore trustStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS"");
InputStream keyStoreStream = ...
trustStore.load(keyStoreStrem, ""your password"".toCharArray());

final CertPathBuilder certPathBuilder = CertPathBuilder.getInstance(""PKIX"");
final X509CertSelector certSelector = new X509CertSelector();
certSelector.setCertificate(certificateToCheck);

final CertPathParameters certPathParameters = new PKIXBuilderParameters(trustStore, certSelector);
final CertPathBuilderResult certPathBuilderResult = certPathBuilder.build(certPathParameters);
final CertPath certPath = certPathBuilderResult.getCertPath();

final CertPathValidator certPathValidator = CertPathValidator.getInstance(""PKIX"");
final PKIXParameters validationParameters = new PKIXParameters(trustStore);
validationParameters.setRevocationEnabled(true); // if you want to check CRL
final X509CertSelector keyUsageSelector = new X509CertSelector();
keyUsageSelector.setKeyUsage(new boolean[] { true, false, true }); // to check digitalSignature and keyEncipherment bits
validationParameters.setTargetCertConstraints(keyUsageSelector);
final PKIXCertPathValidatorResult result = (PKIXCertPathValidatorResult) certPathValidator.validate(certPath, validationParameters);

System.out.println(result);

But be advised that there are many more nuances and details that must be properly addressed in order to make the implementation truly secure. Bad certificate path checking is common reason of security problems.

","Officially you may be out of luck, but it should be relatively easy to build a HMAC_SHA256 out of SHA-256. Just take a look at the Wikipedia page to see how easy this is.
Note that it may be the case that HMAC was not approved in FIPS mode because it is vulnerable to side channel attacks. In that case you should make sure that there is some protection against side channel attacks.
It is a bit dangerous to build your own crypto algorithms out of cryptographic primitives. If you yourself will try and claim FIPS level security then this may become an issue.

How do I calculate a midstate SHA-256 hash in Google Go?
","The Go code you have is the right way to compute sha256 of a stream of bytes.
Most likely the answer is that what you want to do is not sha256. Specifically:

one would have to separate it into two 64 bits of data and hash them individually before hashing the results together. If one was to often change some bits in the second half of the data, one could simplify the calculations and hash the first half of the data only once.

is not a valid way to calculate sha256 (read http://doc.golang.org/src/pkg/crypto/sha256/sha256.go to e.g. see that sha256 does its work on blocks of data, which must be padded etc.). 
The algorithm you described calculates something, but not sha256. 
Since you know the expected value you presumably have some reference implementation of your algorithm in another language so just do a line-by-line port to Go.
Finally, it's a dubious optimization in any case. 128 bits is 16 bytes. Hashing cost is usually proportional to the size of data. At 16 bytes, the cost is so small that the additional work of trying to be clever by splitting data in 8 byte parts will likely cost more than what you saved.

","In sha256.go, at the start of function Sum() the implementation is making a copy of the SHA256 state. The underlying datatype of SHA256 (struct digest) is private to the sha256 package.
I would suggest to make your own private copy of the sha256.go file (it is a small file). Then add a Copy() function to save the current state of the digest:
func (d *digest) Copy() hash.Hash {
    d_copy := *d
    return &d_copy
}

Then simply call the Copy() function to save a midstate SHA256 hash.

How do I calculate a midstate SHA-256 hash in Google Go?
","I ran two Go benchmarks on your 128 bytes of data, using an Intel i5 2.70 GHz CPU. First,  1,000 times, I wrote all 128 bytes to the SHA256 hash and read the sum, which took a total of about 9,285,000 nanoseconds. Second, I wrote the first 64 bytes to the SHA256 hash once and then, 1,000 times, I wrote the second 64 bytes to a copy of the SHA256 hash and read the sum, which took a total of about 6,492,371 nanoseconds. The second benchmark, which assumed the first 64 bytes are invariant, ran in 30% less time than the first benchmark.
Using the first method, you could calculate about 9,305,331,179 SHA256 128-byte sums per day before buying a faster CPU. Using the second method, you could calculate 13,307,927,103 SHA256 128-byte sums per day, assuming the first 64 bytes are invariant 1,000 times in a row, before buying a faster CPU. How many SHA256 128-byte sums per day do you need to calculate? For how many SHA256 128-byte sums per day are the first 64 bytes are invariant?

How do I calculate a midstate SHA-256 hash in Google Go?
","Bitcoin-related byte operations are a bit tricky, as they tend to switch endianness at a whim. First of, we take the initial []byte array representing
00000001c570c4764aadb3f09895619f549000b8b51a789e7f58ea750000709700000000103ca064f8c76c390683f8203043e91466a7fcc40e6ebc428fbcc2d89b574a864db8345b1b00b5ac00000000000000800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080020000

Then, we separate out the first half of the array, obtaining:
00000001c570c4764aadb3f09895619f549000b8b51a789e7f58ea750000709700000000103ca06 4f8c76c390683f8203043e91466a7fcc40e6ebc428fbcc2d8

After that, we need to swap some bytes around. We reverse the order of bytes in every slice of 4 bytes, thusly obtaining:
0100000076C470C5F0B3AD4A9F619598B80090549E781AB575EA587F977000000000000064A03C10396CC7F820F8830614E94330C4FCA76642BC6E0ED8C2BC8F

And that is the array we will be using for calculating the midstate. Now, we need to alter the file hash.go, adding to type Hash interface:
Midstate() []byte

And change the file sha256.go, adding this function:
func (d *digest) Midstate() []byte {
    var answer []byte
    for i:=0;i<len(d.h);i++{
        answer=append(answer[:], Uint322Hex(d.h[i])...)
    }
    return answer
}

Where Uint322Hex converts an uint32 variable into a []byte variable. Having all that, we can call:
var h BitSHA.Hash = BitSHA.New()
h.Write(Str2Hex(""0100000076C470C5F0B3AD4A9F619598B80090549E781AB575EA587F977000000000000064A03C10396CC7F820F8830614E94330C4FCA76642BC6E0ED8C2BC8F""))
log.Printf(""%X"", h.Midstate())

Where Str2Hex turns a string into []byte. The result is:
69FC72E76DB0E764615A858F483E3566E42D56B2BC7A03ADCE9492887010EDA8

Remembering the proper answer:
e772fc6964e7b06d8f855a6166353e48b2562de4ad037abc889294cea8ed1070

We can compare them:
69FC72E7 6DB0E764 615A858F 483E3566 E42D56B2 BC7A03AD CE949288 7010EDA8
e772fc69 64e7b06d 8f855a61 66353e48 b2562de4 ad037abc 889294ce a8ed1070

So we can see that we just need to swap the bytes around a bit in each slice of 4 bytes and we will have the proper ""midstate"" used by Bitcoin pools and miners (until it will no longer be needed due to being deprecated).

","Apart from the order being swapped, it looks like in PHP you're treating the salt value as a literal string to be appended to the password, while in Java you do a hex conversion of the salt first and then use the resulting bytes to update the MessageDigest. This will obviously yield different results. Looking only at the salt:
PHP: Salt -> To bytes (literal) -> SHA-256
Java: Salt -> To bytes (unhex) -> SHA-256
I just tried your Java code, and it's absolutely fine. I also tried to hash the same value in PHP as in Java and it gave me identical results.
The Java equivalent to your PHP code would be:
String password = ""abcd"";
String salt = ""5f8f041b75042e56"";

try {
    MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");

    return digest.digest((password + salt).getBytes(""UTF-8""));
} catch (UnsupportedEncodingException | NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
    return null;
}

After hexing the bytes it returns the following result:
60359BC8A0B09898335AA5A037B1E1B9CE3A1FE0D4CEF13514901FB32F3BCEB0

And in PHP doing:
<?
echo hash('sha256', ""abcd"".""5f8f041b75042e56"");
?>

Returns exactly the same.

"9548700","Symfony2 Security Encoders not recognising UserInterface instance","I have recently started setting up the security for my Symfony2 project. I opted to encode with sha256 using a salt. When I tried to login with a sample account in the database (with self-calculated sha256 salt/hash), it kept failing without giving me any error messages and I could not figure out why.
I decided to put some simple code in the loginAction() method of my Controller. This is the method that Symfony2 calls when a user fails to login using the specified form. I entered the following code:
$factory = $this->get('security.encoder_factory');
$em = $this->container->get('doctrine')->getEntityManager();
$userRep = $em->getRepository('MyProjectMyBundle:Users');
$user = $userRep->find(2);

$encoder = $factory->getEncoder($user);
$password = $encoder->encodePassword('cookie', 'thisisasalt');
$user->setPassword($password);
print($password);

However, when I tried to login, Symfony2 gave me the following error:
Catchable Fatal Error: Argument 1 passed to Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Encoder\EncoderFactory::getEncoder() must be an instance of Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserInterface, instance of MyProject\MyBundle\Entity\Users given, called in /var/www/Symfony/src/MyProject/MyBundle/Controller/MainController.php on line 35 and defined in /var/www/Symfony/vendor/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/Encoder/EncoderFactory.php line 33

So basically, it's saying that the argument of getEncoder() must be an instance of Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserInterface. However, when I inspect MyProject\MyBundle\Entity\Users.php, it starts with the following lines:
<?php
namespace MyProject\MyBundle\Entity;

use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserInterface;
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

...

So the Users class actually implements the UserInterface class. It contains all the functions in UserInterface class. I have created all these files in the way the Symfony2 tutorial told me to. What is the reason Symfony2 doesn't recognize my Users instance as an UserInterface instance?
P.S.: The database was created by someone else, I just have to work with it. The Users table contains many more information than just that required by UserInterface.
","Nevermind, I am an idiot.
I forgot that, in addition to including the UserInterface class, you also have to make sure your class implements the UserInterface.
I changed it to this:
class Users implements UserInterface

It now works perfectly.

","Let me reply regarding sha 256 as well as sha 512.
in short:
The algorithm itself is endian agnostic. The endian sensitive parts are when data is imported from a byte buffer to the algorithm working variables and when it is exported back to the digest result - also a byte buffer. If the import / export include casting, then endian matters. 
Where could casting occur: 
In sha 512 there is a working buffer of 128 bytes. 
In my code its defined like this:
    union
    {
        U64   w [80]; (see U64 example below)
        byte  buffer [128];
    };

Input data is copied to this byte buffer and then work is done on W. This means the data was casted to some 64 bit type. This data will have to be swapped. in my case its swapped for little endian machines.
A better method would be to prepare a get macro that takes each byte and places it in its correct place in the u64 type.
When the algorithm is done the digest result is output from the working variables to some byte buffer, if this is done by memcpy it will also have to be swapped.
Another casting could occur when implementing sha 512 - which is designed for 64 bit machines - on 32 bit machines. In my case I have a 64 bit type that is defined:
    typedef struct {
        uint high;
        uint low;
    } U64;

Assume I define it for little endian as well, as follows:
    typedef struct {
        uint low;
        uint high;
    } U64;

And then the k algorithm init is done like this:
    static const SHA_U64 k[80] =  
    { 
        {0xD728AE22, 0x428A2F98}, {0x23EF65CD, 0x71374491}, ...
        ...
        ...
    }

But i need the logic value of k[0].high to be the same in any machine. 
So in this example I will need another k array with high and low values swapped.
After the data is stored in the working parameters any bitwise manipulation would have the same result on both big/little endian machines. 
Good method would be to avoid any casting: 
Import bytes from input buffer to your working parameters using macro.
Work with logical values without thinking about the memory mapping.
Export output to digest result with a macro.
Macro for taking 32 bits from a byte buffer to int32 (BE = big endian):
    #define GET_BE_BYTES_FROM32(a) 
    ((((NQ_UINT32) (a)[0]) << 24) | 
    (((NQ_UINT32) (a)[1]) << 16)  | 
    (((NQ_UINT32) (a)[2]) << 8)   | 
    ((NQ_UINT32) (a)[3]))

SEVERE: jdbcrealm.invaliduserreason
WARNING: WEB9102: Web Login Failed: com.sun.enterprise.security.auth.login.common.LoginException: Login failed: Security Exception

First off, I am running GlassFish 3.1 and have setup the digest for my JDBC realm to SHA-256.
My User class has the following annotated password field:
@Basic(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
@Column(length = 45, nullable = false)
private String password;

The following helper method is responsible for hashing the password:
private byte[] digest(String input) {
    byte[] output = null;
    try {
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");
        output = md.digest(input.getBytes(""UTF-8""));
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException ex) {
        Logger.getLogger(RegistrationController.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);
    } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException ex) {
        Logger.getLogger(RegistrationController.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);
    }
    return output;
}

I then set the password on the user as follows:
u.setPassword(Base64.encode(digest(password)).toString());

I wouldn't have Base64 encoded the because this seems to be undocumented but this question: Glassfish Security - jdbcRealm: How to configure login with SHA-256 digest suggests you do need to do so.
So I guess what I would like to know is, does GlassFish expect a String (VARCHAR) or a byte[] (BLOB) as the password field in the database, am I correctly hashing the password, and is it correct to additionally Base64 encode the password hash?
Thanks!
","
Does GlassFish expect a String (VARCHAR) or a byte[] (BLOB) as the password field in the database?

It expects a column that maps to the Java Type java.lang.String in JDBC, and those would typically be CHAR, VARCHAR etc. LOBs would not work as the JDBC realm implementation issues a ResultSet.getString method call invocation to obtain the password hash.

Am I correctly hashing the password, and is it correct to additionally Base64 encode the password hash?

Base64 encoding is not the only supported option. You can perform Hex encoding as well. But you must perform either of these, and configure the JDBC Realm to perform the same at runtime. In the absence of an encoding parameter, Glassfish will convert the byte sequence associated with the digest, to a sequence of characters in the charset configured for the realm.
I suspect the problem has something to do with the mention of UTF-8 encoding in the expression input.getBytes(""UTF-8""). It would be worth verifying if the Base64 encoding of the result provided by your digest method actually matches the password hashes stored in the database.
Also, considering the reason provided for the failure being jdbcrealm.invaliduserreason, I would also suspect that one of the following conditions might be true:

The encoding parameter is not specified for the JDBC Realm; it should preferably be one of base64 or hex (the case does not matter, going by the source code of the JDBC realm), otherwise you would end up in the scenario where the digest byte array is converted to a character array (which in my opinion is a bit flaky unless you can guarantee that the password provided by users are always in a particular encoding).
No password hash exists for the user in the database. See my previous answer on the SQL query executed; you might want to run the query yourself. You can log the statements issued by Derby (if you are using it as the database), by placing a file named derby.properties in the location of your Derby database with the property derby.language.logStatementText=true in it. On shutting down the database, the derby.log file will be populated with all the queries issued by the application server.
The SQL statement prepared by Glassfish is incorrect.
A connection to the database could not be established.

Salting happens before hashing, it offers some protection against rainbow table attacks and users using the same password on multiple sites.

","The argument list for CC_SHA256 is:
 extern unsigned char *CC_SHA256(const void *data, CC_LONG len, unsigned char *md);

From the man page: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man3/CC_SHA256.3cc.html
Parameters explained:

*data is the input string, what you want to be hashed. It's a C string-type. A way to get this is to call 'inputData.bytes', with inputData a NSData object.
len is the length of the input string. As you'll realize if you'll start working with C strings, it's pretty normal for functions working with strings to ask for the length. That's because in C strings are just a sequence of bytes, and while text strings are generally terminated by a null byte, binary strings can have any length. It's also for safety (""buffer overflows"").
*md is the output. Again, this is returned as a C string, of fixed length 32 bytes for SHA256 (that's why you don't see an outputLength parameter).
The output is ""not relevant"", but can be used to check if the function ran properly: if(CC_SHA256(...)) { all ok; }

The result string is stored into *md, and it's a binary C string, 32 bytes long. It's 32 bytes long because that's the length of SHA256 digests; for example, 16 bytes for MD5, 20 bytes for SHA1, etc. It's just how the algorithm works!
The output is just a binary string. If you want to make it into hex format you need to store it into a NSData object, and then get a hex representation of it:
NSData *resultData = [NSData dataWithBytes:hashedChars length:32];

To get the hex representation then look at this SO answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/25378464/192024

","The way to salt and hash a password is to take the plaintext password, add the salt to it and THEN hash it. When you have an existing password database already sha256-hashed you don't have the plaintext passwords, and you can't easily get them back in plaintext once hashed (which is a good thing).
What you could do instead would be to take the passwords in their current form, sha256 hashed, add the salt and then hash them a second time - or better: many times, with better hashing algorithms.
The function to verify the password would then repeat those steps to check that the password is correct. Assuming the second hash is just sha256-hashing once to make the example clearer, though it's not sufficiently secure:

step1 = sha256(plaintext_password)
password = sha256(step1 + salt)

If you really want to avoid working on top of your existing hash you could create a new table of users where you process passwords in the new way from the beginning, and then gradually migrate user's passwords over to the new table as they log in with their plaintext passwords, and remove them from the old table. 
A third solution could be to deactivate all the old accounts and require them to change their passwords before they can sign in again, via fx. e-mailing them a link to change their passwords.
Makes sense?
That said you will get more qualified answers at https://security.stackexchange.com . For instance I just found this question on why salt->sha256 hashing once is insufficiently secure, and another one here on how to process passwords for more secure storage.

","Surely it is a good idea to make your password hashes more safe, but using a salted SHA-256 is the wrong way to go.
Best practise is to use a password hash function with a cost factor, which allows to control the necessary time to calculate a hash. Good algorithms are BCrypt, SCrypt, Argon2 and PBKDF2. In another answer I tried to explain how the switch to a new algorithm could be done.
The problem with the fast hashes like SHA-256 is the unbelievable speed of GPUs, one can brute-force about 3 Giga SHA-256 per second with affordable hardware.

","The PHP version is correct; the SHA-256 checksum of test is 9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08.
The Java version is returning the same checksum with two 0s stripped out. This is because of the way you're converting bytes into hex. Instead of &ing them with 0xFF, use String.format(), as in this answer:
hexStrBuilder.append(String.format(""%02x"", shaByteArr[i]));

If you want to have the hash for each value in the different columns of your dataset you can apply a self-designed function via map  to the rdd of your dataframe.

test_df = spark.createDataFrame([
    (1,""2"",5,1),(3,""4"",7,8),

def sha_concat(row):
    row_dict = row.asDict()                             #transform row to a dict
    columnarray = row_dict.keys()                       #get the column names
    concat_str = ''
    for v in row_dict.values():
        concat_str = concat_str + '||' + str(v)         #concatenate values
    concat_str = concat_str[2:] 
    row_dict[""sha_values""] = concat_str                 #preserve concatenated value for testing (this can be removed later)
    row_dict[""sha_hash""] = hashlib.sha256(concat_str).hexdigest() #calculate sha256
    return Row(**row_dict)

test_df.rdd.map(sha_concat).toDF().show(truncate=False)

You can use pyspark.sql.functions.concat_ws() to concatenate your columns and pyspark.sql.functions.sha2() to get the SHA256 hash.
Using the data from @gaw:
from pyspark.sql.functions import sha2, concat_ws
df = spark.createDataFrame(
    [(1,""2"",5,1),(3,""4"",7,8)],
    (""col1"",""col2"",""col3"",""col4"")
)
df.withColumn(""row_sha2"", sha2(concat_ws(""||"", *df.columns), 256)).show(truncate=False)

You can pass in either 0 or 256 as the second argument to sha2(), as per the docs:

Returns the hex string result of SHA-2 family of hash functions (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512). The numBits indicates the desired bit length of the result, which must have a value of 224, 256, 384, 512, or 0 (which is equivalent to 256).

The function concat_ws takes in a separator, and a list of columns to join. I am passing in || as the separator and df.columns as the list of columns. 
I am using all of the columns here, but you can specify whatever subset of columns you'd like- in your case that would be columnarray. (You need to use the * to unpack the list.)

","Have you tried feeding in the data incrementally?  You can use messageDigest.update() with the bytes and then get the final digest with messageDigest.digest()?
Allocating a 1GB array in memory is a fairly chunky operation.  You may find that smaller incremental updates are faster in the end.

","Well, unless you are doing this to compare two command line programs, this is not the best test.  Primarily, these numbers are being polluted by the vast differences in overhead associated with each program.  VM start times will vary.  Memory allocation speeds will vary.
To clean this up a bit, simply take two time samples before and after each actual MD5 calculation within the code itself.
This will actually measure performance of the hashing operation itself.

Hashing 1000000 iterations of SHA-256
time java: 2688         372023.8095238095 hashes/sec

time bouncy: 1890       529100.5291005291 hashes/sec

This was run on an Intel i5 8th Gen. Apache and Guava were easily to two fastest implementations. Apache Commons narrowly beat out Guava on 9/10 of my runs. My code for this test is available here.
Note that after running this test I started to wonder if you could go even faster by tapping into the CPU instruction set (Intel has SHA extensions). I'm not sure there is a JVM way to do this without JNI or JNA. I created another question here.

Use ksort() to sort your array before linking your parameters.
Don't use urlencode() to process the vpc_ReturnURL, which would make the SHA256 hash result incorrect. Here is what I found from official Troubleshooting Guide:


c)    Make sure that the vpc_ReturnURL is not URL encoded (i.e. the ""/"" becomes %2f)
      You can use the following link to decode a URL - http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/
      Sample sorted string based on this example as below: (Removed jsessionid, noheader, tdrid from output of 2b) i.e These elements can be removed prior to sorting the order

vpc_AccessCode=A837820A&vpc_Amount=100&vpc_Card=VC&vpc_CardNum=4222222222222&vpc_CardSecurityCode=100&vpc_Command=pay&vpc_Gateway=threeDSecure&vpc_Locale=en&vpc_MerchTxnRef=T2_7956&vpc_Merchant=TESTDIALECTTEST&vpc_ReturnURL=http://anjumpc:8080/dev-pg/payment/3dprocess.do&vpc_Version=1


Don't send/hash the values which keys don't start with vpc_ because MGIS doesn't care about those values and doesn't use those values in hash check. And the guide also mentioned about this:


b)    Remove unnecessary fields for Hash calculation such as vpc_SecureHashType, vpc_SecureHash and anything that does not begins with vpc_ or user_ - i.e fields highlighted in Bold in 2a above to be removed


(Ignore this, the SHA256 can be used on working MIGS merchant)

If you don't implement resource-critical scenarios (load-testing) you can possibly use e.g. JSR223 Sampler / JSR223 PostProcessor / JSR223 PreProcessor with a bit of code.
E.g.

Use JSR223 Sampler / PostProcessor / PreProcessor with the following [groovy] code:


import java.security.MessageDigest;
import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

String [] params = Parameters.split("","");

String text = params[0];
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");

md.update(text.getBytes(""UTF-8""));
byte[] digest = md.digest();

byte[] encoded = Base64.encodeBase64(digest);
String encText = (new String(encoded)).toUpperCase();

vars.put(""encodedValue"",encText);


You can re-use this sampler both to hash both password and auth_token - via ""Parameters"" field in JSR223 Sampler configuration: use e.g. ${password} variable in the first case, and auth_token - in the second.
Hashed value you can refer as ${encodedValue} variable.

Similar groovy code used with __groovy function.
jmeter-plugins set contains ${__MD5(...)}, ${__base64Encode(...)}, ${__uppercase(...)} functions but that's not enough for your case (no SHA256 digest).
You can also look onto OS Process Sampler to implement the same using your OS (nice if linux) capabilities.

","There's a new function __digest, currently in nightly builds

In your case to save in encodedValue variable the result of password variable use the following:
${__digest(SHA-256,${password},,,encodedValue)}

You can download Custom JMeter Functions plugin to call base 64 encoding function:
${__base64Encode(encodedValue, base64Value)}

And then call uppercase function:
${__uppercase(base64Value, finalValue)}

${finalValue} will hold the final value of this operations

The data of the signed request is not „created” using HMAC SHA-256 – it’s signed with it.
The first part of the signed request, before the dot, is the signature – the rest is the data payload. You have to hash that payload data and compare the hash your getting with the signature – these two should match, to prove the signed request is genuine.
If that doesn’t help you see clearer, show us some code please.

","You can always create a customized hash that guarantees uniqueness.  For data in a known domain (like SSN's), the exercise is relatively simple.
If your target hash value actually has more bits available than what you're hashing, the hash simply maps input values to one of the available output values.  This will be a simple linear mapping from input value as a multi-byte integer to the output as a multi-byte integer.
When your target hash value has fewer bits than what's being hashed, then uniqueness cannot ever be guaranteed.

","The probability of a hash collision has nothing to do with the size of the input string (except to the extent that it indicates how many inputs you need to keep uniqueness among). It's possible to have a hash collision when you hash 0 and 1 using a perfect hash algorithm, although the possibility is 1/(2^bit-length). Which in the case of SHA-256 is effectively zero. 
Hash collisions are a birthday paradox problem. In the case of a 256 bit hash, the probability of a collision among two inputs is purely dependent on the count of inputs and is:

1 - (2^256)! / ((2^256^inputcount) * (2^256-inputcount)!) or as others have said -- basically zero for reasonable numbers of inputs.

","Others have pointed out that collisions should not be a concern; that is the whole point of cryptographically secure hash functions. I would just like to add the following:

If your input set is small enough (e.g. data is SSN -- there are less than a billion of them), then the absence of collision is amenable to verification: just test it exhaustively.
If the input set is too big to be exhaustively scanned, then it is expected that the absence of collision cannot be proven. Good hash functions are expected to act as random oracles, and on a random oracle you cannot prove such a property without trying exhaustively. Being able to prove the absence of collision would suspiciously look like a weakness of the function.

Is there a way to generate it directly in SQL Server?
Duplicate disclamer:
My question is not duplicate of SHA256 in T-sql stored procedure as I am looking for the SHA256 base 64 version of the algorithm which is not listed in the page.
Numeric Example
I have this query result in SQL Server

Start date,End date,POD,Amount,Currency 
2016-01-01,2016-12-31,1234567890,12000,EUR

this give me the following string (using concatenate function)

","First, the generator link you provided outputs the base64 representation in not exactly correct format. Namely, it omits the padding sequence. Though theoretically optional, padding is mandatory in MS SQL Server (tested on 2012 and 2016 versions).
With this in mind, the following code gives you what you need:
declare @s varchar(max), @hb varbinary(128), @h64 varchar(128);

select @s = '2016-01-012016-12-31123456789012000EUR';

set @hb = hashbytes('sha2_256', @s);
set @h64 = cast(N'' as xml).value('xs:base64Binary(sql:variable(""@hb""))', 'varchar(128)');

select @hb as [BinaryHash], @h64 as [64Hash];

Apart from the aforementioned padding, there is another caveat for you to look for. Make sure that the input string is always of the same type, that is, either always varchar or always nvarchar. If some of your hashes will be calculated from ASCII strings and some from UTF-16, results will be completely different. Depending on which languages are used in your system, it might make sense to always convert the plain text to nvarchar before hashing.

Okay, one can argue, that only if the user didn't logout you can see that.
Now logout and don't close the browser and get browser dump(any browser, any version) off of Task Manager(i'm not sure how to do the same in Mac). 
Use WinHex editor to open the dump file and do Search/Find: ""password="" or the actual password(since u r testing your own login, you already knew your password).
You can see the password in clear text.
Now my question is, How can i mask the password:
1. Either in the Post request URL
2. Or when the browser is saving my credentials to the dump, i neeed it to be masked/encrypted or should not save the password at all.

Current solution i have as below, but i need any alternatives without much effort.

The password can be read from the memory if it is being sent as
  cleartext. Using the salted hash technique for password transmission
  will resolve this issue. Hashing is a cryptographic technique in which
  the actual value can never be recovered. In the salted hash technique,
  the passwords are stored as hashes in the database. The server
  generates a random string, salt, and sends it along with the Login
  page to the client. A JavaScript code on the page computes a hash of
  the entered password, concatenates the salt and computes a hash of the
  entire string. This value is sent to the server in the POST request.
The server then retrieves the user's hashed password from the
  database, concatenates the same salt and computes a hash. If the user
  had entered the correct password, these two hashes should match.
Now, the POST request will contain the salted hash value of the
  password and the cleartext password will not be present in the memory
SHA 256 is a strong hashing algorithm available today – readymade
  implementations in JavaScript are available and quoted in the ""Good
  Reads"" section.
Note: For pages containing sensitive information or pages wherein data
  can be modified in the database, use JavaScript to flush the memory of
  the browse

On an additional note, i can settle with something Citibank did for their customers on their website.
I logged in the website and in the dump i see my username is masked(as it appears in the website), i need something which does the same to the password field too. can someone explain me how to do it please.

","What you are suggesting has a serious security flaw.  If you calculate the hash on the browser and then send to the server (without the password) then the server can't trust that the browser actually calculated the hash.  A hacker might merely have read the file of hash values and construct a program to send the hash value in.  The security comes from the server (a trusted environment) having the password which can not be guessed from the hash, and then proving to itself that the password produces the hash.
If you send both the hash and the password, then you have not solved your problem about the password being available in clear text.
There would seem to be a way if you hash the password multiple times.  You can hash the password once (or more times) on the browser, and use that for subsequent hashing calls on the server.  It seems normal to hash multiple times (although it is unclear how much this really makes it more secure).  The point is that the browser would be holding an intermediate value which would not tell you the password that the user typed.  It would, however, still tell you the value that you need to send to the server to authenticate the user.  That value is infact a proxy for the password, and is usable as a password in calls to the server.   But ... it is not the password that the user typed in.
One final way looks that it might work:  use an asymmetric encryption.  The server provides a salt value and a public key.  The password is encrypted using the public key, which can only be decrypted by the private key that is held on the server.  Because the salt value changes every session, the encrypted value held in memory itself would not be usable across another session.  The server decrypts the value, extracts the salt, giving it the password from which to go ahead and do password authentication.

","You have to device for how the passwords are stored in the database. There are multiple ways to do this, but there is no way you can create anything that is IMPOSSIBLE to hack/read.
However, you can limit MITM attacks by hashing the password X number of times before sending it to the server.
When the hash is recived by the server, you do X number of new hash rounds. You should also figure out a how to manage your salt.
This should be sufficient for most applications. Also this is how most application does it these days.
gpEasy: http://gpeasy.com/ does this by hasing Sha-256, 50 times on client side. Then another 950 rounds on the server. In total 1000 rounds. This also includes a salt which is calculated by its ""current hash""
def hash(self, pw, loops = 50):
    pw = pw.strip()

On the other hand, each line iterated upon by for w in wordk: has a trailing newline.

","The only thing that you are protected against when adding a salt to your hash is the use of huge tables of pre-computed hashes called ""Rainbow Tables"". These have not been a major problem in quite some time, though because:

Rainbow tables containing extended character sets are massive, some requiring upwards of 16GB of RAM to search.
Parallelized bruteforce cracking across multiple computers, or offloaded to cloud services like AWS are faster, cheaper, and makes the addition of simple salts virtually inconsequential.

Better algorithms hash the password thousands of times and apply the given salt in a cryptographically ""proper"" way to make it more difficult to crack. However, the hashing algorithms that they are based on like SHA and MD5 are designed to be small and fast, and bruteforcing them requires large amounts of CPU time, which is cheap and easy to parallelize.
Bcrypt is different. It uses the Blowfish algorithm which requires relatively large amounts of RAM, which is expensive, and thus difficult to parallelize. This is why everyone recommends it so strongly.
TL;DR Hashing is better than plaintext, salted is better than unsalted, bcrypt is miles better than pretty much everything else out there so frickin use it.

","You should use the built in crypt function:
http://php.net/crypt
You have two options:
Let PHP Crypt generate the salt
$user = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['user']);
$pswd = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['pass']);

//Salt is generated automatically
$encrypt = crypt( $pswd );

Generate the Salt yourself
$user = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['user']);
$pswd = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['pass']);

//These are the settings for the salt (Separated so you can understand it)
$algorithm = ""2a"";
$length = ""12"";

//Start the salt by specifying the algorithm and length
$salt = ""$"" . $algorithm . ""$"" . $length . ""$"";

//Add on random salt and make base64 adjusted for bcrypt's version
$salt .= substr( str_replace( ""+"", ""."", base64_encode( mcrypt_create_iv( 128, MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM ) ) ), 0, 22 );

//Encrypt with your generated salt
$encrypt = crypt( $pswd, $salt );

Verifying it is easy:
if ( $encrypted_pass_fromDB_with_salt === crypt( $passwrd, $encrypted_pass_fromDB_with_salt ) ) echo ""ok"";

","PHP offers now such an easy way to generate safe password hashes, that we should use it, have a look at the function password_hash().
// Hash a new password for storing in the database.
// The function automatically generates a cryptographically safe salt.
$hashToStoreInDb = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);

// Check if the hash of the entered login password, matches the stored hash.
// The salt and the cost factor will be extracted from $existingHashFromDb.
$isPasswordCorrect = password_verify($password, $existingHashFromDb);

Of course it is good to understand how a salt works (and how difficult it is to handle it correctly), so try it out but use the function above for your life system.

The notification.png file is listed in there and seems to be okay.
I noticed that NEMO.SF and NEMO.RSA are in the APK which seems to be like a diplicate and in some other posts people recommended to delete one of both and re-sign the APK. I already did this but it didn't help anything.
I've pretty much tried everything I could find out. So far without any luck. Thanks for any help and suggestions.

","You cannot decrypt a hash, because a hash is not encryption, it is a hash.
It is impossible. The question how long it takes to do an impossible task is meaningless. You can only decrypt something that is encrypted. A hash doesn't encrypt, it hashes. You cannot decrypt a hash because it isn't encrypted in the first place.
A hash function is not injective. It simply cannot be reversed. Period.
A hash function maps a large (potentially infinite) input space to a smaller (usually finite) output space. The Pigeonhole Principle tells us that when we map a larger space to a smaller space, there must be at least some elements of the larger input space that map to the same element of the smaller output space. Since there are potentially multiple inputs that map to the same output, the function cannot be reversed. The information which of the multiple inputs was mapped to the output is lost forever.

","The phrase ""decrypt a sha256 hash?"" is problematic, a hash is not encryption thus it can't be decrypted. What can be done is computed hashes and try to find some input that creates the same hash. But that hash may not be the initial value, it may be some other value that happens to have a matching hash.
Past the end of human life on the earth:
12,700,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years.
((36^64)/100000000)/31536000
36 character in set
64 number of characters
1,000,000 attempts/second
~315,36,000 seconds/year  
There will also be around 36^64 / 2^256 or 34,600,000,000,000,000,000,000 collisions found.
Note that the possible combinations of the string are greater than the number of possible hashes. Thus it is clear that something is being lost when the hash is computed as exemplified by the number of potential collisions.

Windows Enforcement of Authenticode Code Signing and Timestamping
By using Windows 7 SDK signtool the functions to sign SHA-256 is ""unknown commands"", so this signtool is obsolete as a signtool and shouldn't be used any more.
To sign with SHA256 I downloaded the Windows 8.1 SDK to get signtool.exe which got the new functions(/fd and a few others). The BAT file and signtool works on Windows 8 and 10, so I know it works, but crashes on Windows 7 when it tries to timestamp the file.
Signing fails
I use a bat file to sign files, which looks like this(I edited the BAT file so it doesn't show variables, full paths, company name and passwords):
Path\signtool.exe sign /f ""Path\Certificate.p12"" /fd sha256 /p *password* /du ""URL"" /tr ""timestampServer?td=sha256"" /td sha256 /d ""Product name"" ""Filename""

I guess, I don't have the proper SDK to support some of the functions, but I can't find any info on the internet on how to setup this on a Windows 7. I tried to install MS Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable (x64) on my machine without solving the problem.
","Seems I'm no good at reading. I'm answering my own question as others could find it hard to find, just like I did.
Windows doesn't support the signtool.exe on Windows 7 any more, so that is why old/obsolete functions like SHA-1 signing is still working, but SHA-256 time stamping is a problem. I found this on MSDN:

I tried to look for similar questions on the Web, but found only symmetric encryption/description problems discussed, I don't need symmetric encryption for the token

UPDATE
I've figured out!!! The problem was in the wrong variable type!
I used string, and when I replaced it with AnsiString it worked out!
function GetStringHash(Source: AnsiString): string;
var
  ...

Besides that I replaced
  for i := 0 to Length(Digest) do

with
  for i := 0 to Length(Digest)-1 do

in DigestToStr function

I discovered a couple of ways to do this, which are mod_perl and mod_authnz_external, both of which are too slow, because apache runs that whenever any object inside a protected directory is called. That means that a user may have to be authenticated hundreds of times in a single session.
Has anyone ever managed to get Apache to use something that's more secure than MD5 and SHA-1 without moving authentication away from Apache? Salted SHA-2 would be a real bonus.
Thanks!
","If you're on a GNU/Linux system with a version of glibc2 released in the last 5 or so years, you can modify htpasswd's crypt() implementation to prepend ""$6$"" to the salt, and then it'd be as simple as:
 # htpasswd -d -c .htpasswd someusername

When the salt starts with ""$6$"", glibc2 will use salted SHA-512, with the up to 16 characters after that being the salt, in the range [a-zA-Z0-9./].
See man 3 crypt.
I'm not aware of any patch to support this, but it should be a simple one.
EDIT: I'd also like to mention that one round of even salted SHA-512 is breakable if your attacker is determined enough. I'd recommend, and am using in most things I've been able to edit, 128000 rounds of PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA512, but this would be a very extensive edit, unless you want to link htpasswd against openssl, which has a PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC() function.

Password: Simple123
","I faced a similar task where I have to authenticate users against Django passwords in Java. After trying unsuccessfully to achieve this goal using the default pbkdf2_sha256 hasher in Django, I ended up changing the method used to hash the Django password to be able to easily replicate the same algorithm in Java.
As described in Django documentation you can modify the order in which PASSWORD_HASHERS are defined in settings.py, I put this hasher in first position:
'django.contrib.auth.hashers.SHA1PasswordHasher'
In this way the password hash stored in the Django database is something like this:
sha1$upSZarr0w7CZ$304b22b1a9e7e5387e79f50e691043d3faf83c48
If you already have some passwords in the database they will be automatically converted by Django at first user login.
You can easily tokenize the hash using $ as separator; the first token is always sha1 (the algorithm used), the second token is the salt and the last token is the actual hash.
To match a password you can verify that
304b22b1a9e7e5387e79f50e691043d3faf83c48
is the SHA1 sum of the salt concatenated with the expected password:
SHA1(upSZarr0w7CZ + password) = 304b22b1a9e7e5387e79f50e691043d3faf83c48
In our case the security implications of using a weaker algorithm for password hashing was acceptable.

","It seems that MSDN documentation is right in the sense that it should be supported in XP SP3 by design, and if it is not, it's only because of a bug in .NET 3.5.
Both AesCryptoServiceProvider and SHA256CryptoServiceProvider use the same cryptograhics service named ""Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider"". Under XP, the name of the service is slightly different: ""Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider (Prototype)"". The constructor of AesCryptoServiceProvider performs a simple check:
string providerName = ""Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider"";
if(Environment.OSVersion.Version.Major == 5 && Environment.OSVersion.Version.Minor == 1)
{
    providerName = ""Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider (Prototype)"";
}

The constructors of SHAxxxCryptoServiceProvider classes do not check the (Prototype) name, and this is why they fail in XP. If they did, they would succeed.
There is a simple workaround on a given PC. Go to registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\Defaults\Provider, find its subkey named ""Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider (Prototype)"", export it to .reg, edit this .reg and delete "" (Prototype)"" from its name. When you import it back, the original key will be duplicated to the new key without (Prototype), with the same contents. From now on, SHA256CryptoServiceProvider will work on this XPSP3 machine.

","You can do it via Beanshell PreProcessor as follows:

Add a HTTP Header Manager as a child of your HTTP Request sampler
Add aforementioned Beanshell PreProcessor the same way
Put the following code into the PreProcessor's ""Script"" area:
import org.apache.commons.httpclient.auth.DigestScheme; // necessary imports
import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64;
import org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils;
import org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.control.Header;

String url = sampler.getUrl().toString(); // get URL
String nonce = DigestScheme.createCnonce(); // get nonce
long timestamp = System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000L;

String combined = url + nonce + timestamp; // put everything together

byte[] base64 = Base64.encodeBase64(combined.getBytes()); // encode as Base64

String headerValue = DigestUtils.sha256Hex(base64); // encode SHA256 

sampler.getHeaderManager().add(new Header(""headerName"", headerValue)); // add generated header to request


sampler here is a shorthand reference to parent HTTP Request Sampler class which I believe is HTTPSamplerProxy so its methods are used to get URL and add generated header value. 
methods to generate MD5 hash and SHA256 hex are from Apache Commons libraries which are widely used under JMeter's hood.

","@dmitrit's answer is helpful but I needed to do some tweaks to the code to get it to work. Here is what I did:
import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64;
import org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils;

String apiKey = vars.get(""ApiKey"");
String apiSecret = vars.get(""ApiSecret"");
long timestamp = System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000L;

String combined = apiKey + apiSecret + timestamp;

String generatedSignature = DigestUtils.sha256Hex(combined);

vars.put(""GeneratedSignature"", generatedSignature);

Note the main differences are:

Most important: DigestUtils.sha256Hex takes a String instead of a byte array. Converting first to bytes screwed up the hash, I think due to padding.
I added the resulting value to vars so it can be used later in Jmeter in the usual way (${GeneratedSignature}).
ApiKey and ApiSecret are defined elsewhere in a Jmeter User Defined Variables element.

With this I was able to make the following work with Mashery in accordance with their authentication instructions posted here.

According to the link above:

The only thumbprint algorithm currently supported is sha1. If you are
  not certain which thumbprint algorithm your certificate supports, you
  can use the certmgr.msc snap in with the Microsoft Management Console
  (MMC) to inspect the certificate.

I've also seen this error when copy->paste the thumbprint from certmgr.msc into the .cscfg files.  This is because non-printable chars are actually copied to the clipboard and pasted into the thumbprint attribute.  Removing these chars by putting your cursor just before the first visible character in the hash and backspacing, alleviates the issue.

"22358406","Can Azure Cloud service use a sha256 certificate","We need to update our Azure Cloud service with a brand new cert.
The one I have been given specifies sha256 as the signature hash algorithm.
We previously had one with sha1.
When I tried to update and package of the Azure deployment the error I get states that the thumprint is not valid.

Error 8   The XML specification is not valid: The 'thumbprint' attribute is invalid - The value '‎‎REDACTED' is invalid according to its datatype 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/ServiceHosting/2008/10/ServiceConfiguration:ThumbprintType' - The Pattern constraint failed.

In the ServiceConfiguration.Cloud.cscfg file, the XML looks like this:
<Certificates>
  <Certificate name=""cert"" thumbprint=""REDACTED"" thumbprintAlgorithm=""sha1"" />
</Certificates>

with the thumprint attribute squiggly lined as the error above.
I've tried thumbprintAlgorithm=256, but this didn't work, presumably not a valid value.
Does it need to be sha1? Can Azure support sha256?
EDIT:
I found the following in the service defintion schema, that indicates sha256 is allowed:
<xs:attribute name=""thumbprintAlgorithm"" type=""ThumbprintAlgorithmTypes"" use=""required"">
  <xs:annotation>
    <xs:documentation>
      The hash algorithm that generates a digest of data (or thumbprint)
      for digital signatures such as MD5, SHA1, SHA256. This is different than
      the algorithm used in creating the signature inside the certificate.
    </xs:documentation>
  </xs:annotation>
</xs:attribute>

however, the only type value allowed by the schema is sha1 as follows:
<xs:simpleType name=""ThumbprintAlgorithmTypes"">
<xs:restriction base=""xs:string"">
  <xs:enumeration value=""sha1"">
    <xs:annotation>
      <xs:documentation>
        Algorithm currently used in certmgr.msc to display thumbprint.
      </xs:documentation>
    </xs:annotation>
  </xs:enumeration>
</xs:restriction>


Any ideas? Googling sha256 and that  XML node is not getting me far.
","Yes, Azure does support certificates that use SHA256.
To clarify, the Azure is looking at the thumbprint algorithm not the  signature hash algorithm in the ServiceConfiguration.Cloud.cscfg.  The thumbprint is the value used to pull the certificate from the certificate store and is unrelated to the Signature Hash Algorithm.
In the ServiceConfiguration.Cloud.cscfg file, the XML looks like this:
<Certificates>
  <Certificate name=""cert"" thumbprint=""REDACTED"" thumbprintAlgorithm=""sha1"" />
</Certificates>

Notice the above XML in the config specifies the thumbprint algorithm, which is SHA1 even in the case of your certificate that uses SHA256 for Signature Hash Algorithm, if your thumbprint was hashed using SHA256, you would have other schema validation problems because the hash is a different length then SHA1.

my $digest = hmac_sha256_base64 ($request, $self->{SecretKey});

and attach $digest as a parameter to their request URI. The server-side will use the same algorithm to create a digest from the client URI and compare that to the value sent by the client.
What I can't find is Perl support for generating the SecretKey of the correct length to use when generating HMAC SHA256 digest. 
For my Amazon AWS account I'm being given a 40 ASCII character base64 encoded string.

","I suggest you use a PBKDF2 algorithm.  PBKDF2 = ""Password-based Key Derivation Function (#2)"".   It is defined in PKCS #5 (RFC 2898).   This is the recommended way to derive a key from a password.  You will need a salt, as well. A typical iteration count is 1000.  
This page says it has a perl implementation of PBKDF2.  I haven't tried it. 
Apparently there is also a Crypto::PBKDF2, but it is saddled with dependencies you may not want.

I just tried Anthony Thyssen's perl program for pbkdf2 - it works great. Simple, easy.

"19962424","Probability of collision with truncated SHA-256 hash","I have a database-driven web application where the primary keys of all data rows are obfuscated as follows: SHA256(content type + primary key + secret), truncated to the first 8 characters. The content type is a simple word, e.g. ""post"" or ""message"" and the secret is a 20-30 char ASCII constant. The result is stored in a separate indexed column for fast DB lookup.
How do I calculate the probability of a hash collision in this scenario? I am not a mathematician at all, but a friend claimed that due to the Birthday Paradox the collision probability would be ~1% for 10,000 rows with an 8-char truncation. Is there any truth to this claim?
","Yes, there is a collision probability & it's probably somewhat too high. The exact probability depends on what ""8 characters"" means.
Does ""8 characters"" mean:

A) You store 8 hex characters of the hash?  That would store 32 bits.
B) You store 8 characters of BASE-64? That would store 48 bits.
C) You store 8 bytes, encoded in some single-byte charset/ or hacked in some broken way into a character encoding?  That would store 56-64 bits, but if you don't do encoding right you'll encounter character conversion problems.
D) You store 8 bytes, as bytes? That genuinely stores 64 bits of the hash.

Storing binary data as either A) hex or D) binary bytes, would be my preferred options. But I'd definitely recommend either reconsidering your ""key obfuscation"" scheme or significantly expanding the stored key-size to reduce the (currently excessive) probability of key collision.
From Wikipedia:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Cast_as_a_collision_problem
The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to hash functions: the expected number of N-bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2^N, but rather only 2^(N/2).
Since in the most conservative above understanding of your design (reading it as A, 8 chars of hex == 32 bits) your scheme would be expected to suffer collisions if it stored on the scale of ~64,000 rows. I would consider such an outcome unacceptable for all serious, or even toy, systems.
Transaction tables may have volumes, allowing growth for the business, from 1000 - 100,000 transactions/day (or more). Systems should be designed to function 100 years (36500 days), with a 10x growth factor built in, so.. 
For your keying mechanism to be genuinely robust & professionally useful, you would need to be able to scale it up to potentially handle ~36 billion (2^35) rows without collision. That would imply 70+ bits of hash.
The source-control system Git, for example, stores 160 bits of SHA-1 hash (40 chars of hex == 20 bytes or 160 bits). Collisions would not be expected to be probable with < less than 2^80 different file revisions stored.

A possibility better design might be, rather than hashing & pseudo-randomizing the key entirely & hoping (against hope) to avoid collisions, to prepend/ append/ fold-in 8-10 bits of a hash into the key.
This would generates a larger key, containing all the uniqueness of the original key plus 8-10 bits of verification.  Attempts to access keys would then be verified, and more than 3 invalid requests would be treated as an attempt to violate security by ""probing"" the keyspace & would trigger semi-permanent lockout. 
The only major costs here, would be a modest reduction in the size of the available keyspace for a given int-size.  32-bit int to/from the browser would have 8-10 bits dedicated to security, thus leaving 22-24 for the actual key. So you'd use 64-bit ints where that was not sufficient.

The requests from Shopify include an HMAC header that is created from a shared secret key and the body of the request.
I need to calculate the HMAC on my server and match it to the value in the request header to ensure that the request is authentic.
I can't seem to create the appropriate mechanism in .NET to create a matching HMAC value.
My algorithm at this point is as follows:
public static string CreateHash(string data)
    {
        string sharedSecretKey = ""MY_KEY"";

        byte[] keyBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(sharedSecretKey);
        byte[] dataBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data);

        //use the SHA256Managed Class to compute the hash
        System.Security.Cryptography.HMACSHA256 hmac = new HMACSHA256(keyBytes);
        byte[] hmacBytes = hmac.ComputeHash(dataBytes);

        //retun as base64 string. Compared with the signature passed in the header of the post request from Shopify. If they match, the call is verified.
        return System.Convert.ToBase64String(hmacBytes);
    }

The Shopify docs for verifying their webhooks can be found HERE but only PHP and Ruby samples are included.
Can anyone see what I might be doing wrong? Should I be just passing the entire JSON request body as a string into this method?
","As you allude to in your question, you should be hashing the entire json request body in your method.
My .NET isn't too good, but Here's the part of the ruby example that shows you what to do:
post '/' do

  . . .

  data = request.body.read
  verified = verify_webhook(data, env[""HTTP_X_SHOPIFY_HMAC_SHA256""])

  . . .

You can see that we're just grabbing the body of the request (as a string) and throwing it into the verify method verbatim. Give it a try and hopefully you'll have more luck.

","As an improvement to the above code, you can convert it to an attribute with a few minor changes:
public class VerifyShopifyAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute
{
    private readonly string sharedSecret = ""abc"";

    public override void OnActionExecuting(HttpActionContext actionContext)
    {
        if (!ValidateHash(actionContext))
        {
            // reject the request with a 400 error
            var response = actionContext.Request.CreateErrorResponse(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest, ""Bad Request"");
            actionContext.Response = response;
        }
    }

    private bool ValidateHash(HttpActionContext actionContext)
    {
        var context = (HttpContextBase)actionContext.Request.Properties[""MS_HttpContext""];
        context.Request.InputStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);

        using (var stream = new MemoryStream())
        {
            context.Request.InputStream.CopyTo(stream);
            string requestBody = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(stream.ToArray());

            var keyBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(sharedSecret);
            var dataBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(requestBody);

            //use the SHA256Managed Class to compute the hash
            var hmac = new HMACSHA256(keyBytes);
            var hmacBytes = hmac.ComputeHash(dataBytes);

            //retun as base64 string. Compared with the signature passed in the header of the post request from Shopify. If they match, the call is verified.
            var hmacHeader = HttpContext.Current.Request.Headers[""x-shopify-hmac-sha256""];

            return hmacHeader == createSignature;
        }
    }
}

And then you can use it like so for all of your webhooks:
[RoutePrefix(""api"")]
public class ShopifyWebHookController : ApiController
{
    [VerifyShopify]
    [HttpPost]

","Your key contains values greater then the value 127 and, Mac and SecretKeySpec use bytes, which in Java can contain values from -128 to 127.

In the HmacSHA256 algorithm, the key is interpreted as a string of hexadecimal values. In the case of your secret, the decimal values of this key are:
3,147,233,68,238,129,8,187,102,252,159,164,249,159,156,134,36,129,233,224,81,158,24,35,43,166,27,7,103,238,232,198
As you can see, some of them have a value over 127. When creating the SecretKeySpec object and while doing calculations within the Mac class, Java uses byte[] to store this and related sequences. In Java, a byte can contain values from -128 to 127, which means that when storing this secret, the values > 127 will ""flip"" and will make sure the calculations following this will not go as you'd expect.
In the Swift case (and with C++, Ruby, and other languages), the conversion from hex to byte occurs without losing the actual value.

","If possible, use PBKDF2 or bcrypt. Plain SHA-2 is too fast.
If you can't use either of them, then you should at least iterate SHA-256 a couple of thousand times to slow down a password guessing attack:
var hash = SHA256(SHA256(salt)+password)
for(int i=0; i<10000; i++)
   hash = SHA256(hash);
return hash;

Remember that every user needs to have a different salt, which is usually stored alongside the password hash. A per-application salt is not enough.

For upgrading I'd use the old hash as input to the new function. That way existing hashes gain most of the security increase of the upgrade without requiring the user to login. Don't keep the old MD5 hashes around.
Then on the first login of each user, upgrade his hash to a clean new hash that doesn't use MD5 anymore.

Whilst this is for VB6 (and is native code), it should be straightforward to adapt for use with VBA. As it sounds that you need a worksheet function (i.e. UDF) then you will also need to write this, using the above class.

","Have you thought of using CryptoJS
CryptoJS is a growing collection of standard and secure cryptographic algorithms implemented in JavaScript using best practices and patterns. They are fast, and they have a consistent and simple interface.
CryptoJS
Basically you can include components/lib-typedarrays-min.js and then do the following in code.
var reader = new FileReader();

// If we use onloadend, we need to check the readyState.
reader.onloadend = function(evt) {
  if (evt.target.readyState == FileReader.DONE) { // DONE == 2

    var wordArray = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(e.target.result);
    var hash = CryptoJS.SHA256(wordArray);
  }
};

var blob = file.slice(start, stop + 1);

","An HMAC is a message authentication code. It is a digest used to verify that a message has not been tampered with, similar to a signature. It is constructed using a one-way hash function, in this case SHA256. It is not an encryption, and it cannot be reversed, therefore the value you have cannot be decrypted.
The only thing you can do with an HMAC is, given the HMAC and the corresponding plain-text, verifying the origin of the plain-text and that it has not been tampered with.
Looking at the GitHub page for the Dart crypto library, it looks like it only supports digest algorithms. There are no encryption algorithms listed, so you will need to use a different library if you want to do two-way encryption which can actually be decrypted. The Cipher library looks like it could be promising in this regard.

Depend on it
Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

dependencies:
  encrypt: ""^0.2.0""

Install it
You can install packages from the command line:
with pub:

$ pub get
with Flutter:
$ flutter packages get
Alternatively, your editor might support pub get or flutter packages get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

Import it
Now in your Dart code, you can use:

After doing some research I found out that most people said there are 2^256 combinations. Could someone explain ? To make the context clear, I write a paper about cryptocurrencies and try to explain how many different combinations there are to encrypt and how long this could take ( therefore how many guesses it could take) and compare this to the amount of total atoms in the universe (roughly 10^85).
","SHA-256 produces 256 bits which is 32 bytes, not characters, each byte has 256 possible values.
There are 256 bits and each bit has 2 values (0 or 1), thus 2^256.
There are 32 bytes and each byte has 256 values, thus 256^32.
Note: 2^256 == 256^32 ~= 10^77.
The 32 bytes can be encoded many ways, in hexadecimal it would be 64 characters, in Base64 it would be 44 characters.

","Because you do this:
timestamp := time.Now().Unix()
log.Print(fmt.Sprintf(""%x"", sha256.Sum256([]byte(string(timestamp))))[:45])

You print the hex form of the SHA-256 digest of the data:
[]byte(string(timestamp))

What is it exactly?
timestamp is of type int64, converting it to string is:

Converting a signed or unsigned integer value to a string type yields a string containing the UTF-8 representation of the integer. Values outside the range of valid Unicode code points are converted to ""\uFFFD"".

But its value is not a valid unicode code point so it will always be ""\uFFFD"" which is efbfbd (UTF-8 encoded), and your code always prints the SHA-256 of the data []byte{0xef, 0xbf, 0xbd} which is (or rather its first 45 hex digits because you slice the result):
83d544ccc223c057d2bf80d3f2a32982c32c3c0db8e26

I guess you wanted to generate some random bytes and calculate the SHA-256 of that, something like this:
data := make([]byte, 10)
for i := range data {
    data[i] = byte(rand.Intn(256))
}
fmt.Printf(""%x"", sha256.Sum256(data))

Note that if you'd use the crypto/rand package instead of math/rand, you could fill a slice of bytes with random values using the rand.Read() function, and you don't even have to set seed (and so you don't even need the time package):
data := make([]byte, 10)
if _, err := rand.Read(data); err == nil {
    fmt.Printf(""%x"", sha256.Sum256(data))

UPDATE2: Maybe I should expand the question a bit, since it may have been under-explained, sorry.

","All those sites return valid values.
Sites 4 and 5 use \n as line break.

EDIT
I see you edited your question to add Encoding.Default.GetBytes in the code example.
This is interesting, because you see there is some string to byte array conversion to run before computing the hash. Line breaking (\n or \r\n) as well as text encoding are both ways to interpret your string to get different bytes values.
Once you have the same bytes as input, all hash results will be identical.

EDIT 2:
If you're dealing with bytes directly, then just compute the hash with those bytes. Don't try to provide different hash values; a hash must only return one value. If your clients have a different hash value than yours, then they are doing it wrong.
That being said, I'm pretty sure it won't ever happen because there isn't any way to misinterpret a byte array.

","I'm not sure the string you get in the end is what you're after. I think a common scenario is to use 
new BASE64Encoder().encode(hash)

","As MSDN says GetCertHashString method always

Returns the SHA1 hash value for the X.509v3 certificate as a hexadecimal string.

regardless of signature algorithm since it is Windows specific thumbprint used internally in certifcates store.
You can calculate any other hash by accessing certificate content from its RawData property, e.g. for SHA256:
using (var hasher = SHA256.Create())
{
    var hash = hasher.ComputeHash(cert.RawData);
    Console.WriteLine(BitConverter.ToString(hash));

<?php

","Your key generation function is flawed - it produces only integers and converts those to strings, massively reducing the available key space and weakening your keys significantly. 
However, it does produce 16 byte values which are suitable for AES keys. I can only assume you've changed your code since you last received the error message?
I strongly recommend you revert to just using the KeyGenerator to produce your AES keys. That will do so in a secure fashion.

Why such a behavior ?
","This is because you don't see the raw bytes of the hash but rather the Base64 encoding.
Base64-encoding converts a block of 3 bytes to a block of four characters. This works well if the number of bytes is divisible by 3. If it is not, then you use a padding-character so the number of resulting characters is still divisible by 4.
So:
(no of bytes)%3 = 0  => no padding needed
(no of bytes)%3 = 1  => pad with ==
(no of bytes)%3 = 2  => pad with =

A SHA256-hash is 256 bit, that's 32 bytes. So you will get 40 characters for the first 30 bytes, 3 characters for the last 2 bytes and the padding will always be one =.

Do I need to use SHA256 when I send username and password over network ? How to use SHA256 over those data ( I have function sha256_hash which use string and return hashed value, but I don't know where to call that function ) ?
","You should hash the desired values when the form is submitted.
I guess something like this should work : 
HTML
<form onsubmit=""return myOnSubmit(this);"">

JavaScript
function myOnSubmit(aForm) {
    //Getting the two input objects
    var inputUsername = aForm['username'];
    var inputPassword = aForm['password'];

    //Hashing the values before submitting
    inputUsername.value = sha256_hash(inputUsername.value);
    inputPassword.value = sha256_hash(inputPassword.value);

    //Submitting
    return true;
}

EDIT : 
Because of the 'Hashing the values before submitting' part, it will not work if you have a maxlength property, because hashed values are much longer than just the clear password.
If you MUST use a maximum length, then you would need to implement HIDDEN FIELDS and changing those values, and making sure the fields containing the clear data aren't submitted (outside of the <FORM> tag).

"13792514","How to convert a SHA256RSA signed Server certificate to SHA1RSA?","I am generating a private key with tomcat keystore. After the certificate request is generated and submitted, the server certificate seems to have signature SHA256RSA algorithm and eventually gives a ""cannot establish chain from reply error"". The root and intermediate certificates are all SHA1RSA.  While generating the key pair and certificate request it has been specified as SHA1RSA to be the signature algorithm.
Could anyone assist as in how to generate the server certificate with SHA256RSA?
Here are the steps I followed (broken into multiple lines for readability):
keytool -genkey -dname ""CN=xxxx, OU=Servers, O=xx, C=US"" \
    -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA1withRSA -keysize 2048 \
    -keypass xxx -keystore tomcat2k.keystore

keytool -certreq -v -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA1withRSA \
    -keysize 2048 -keypass xxx -file certreq.csr -keystore tomcat2k.keystore

Certificates received: Root, Intermediate (Both SHA1RSA), and Sever(SHA256RSA)
Root.
Intermediate gets imported.  Server Certificate fails to establish the chain.
","If you have access to openssl, I recommend to use that instead of keytool. If you generate a certificate signing request, use the option -sha256 to set the hashing algorithm you are looking for. 
First generate a certificate signing request:
$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 4096
$ openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr -sha256

Have the certificate signing request signed by you CA of choice. If you want a self signed certificate you can use the following, otherwise skip this step:
$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 4096
$ openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.pem
$ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out server.pem

Finally, convert the certificates signed server.pem certificate to p7b, which is what tomcat expects, and then import the p7b in the tomcat keystore.
$ openssl crl2pkcs7 -nocrl -certfile server.pem -out tomcat2k.p7b -certfile ca.pem
$ keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias server -file tomcat2k.p7b -keystore tomcat2k.jks

"16993486","How to programmatically calculate Chrome extension ID?","I'm building an automated process to produce extensions. Is there a code example of calculating the extension-ID directly and entirely bypassing interaction with the browser?
(I'm answering my own question, below.)
","I was only able to find a related article with a Ruby fragment, and it's only available in the IA: http://web.archive.org/web/20120606044635/http://supercollider.dk/2010/01/calculating-chrome-extension-id-from-your-private-key-233
Important to know:

This depends on a DER-encoded public key (raw binary), not a PEM-encoded key (nice ASCII generated by base64-encoding the DER key).
The extension-IDs are base-16, but are encoded using [a-p] (called ""mpdecimal""), rather than [0-9a-f].

Using a PEM-encoded public key, follow the following steps:

If your PEM-formatted public-key still has the header and footer and is split into multiple lines, reformat it by hand so that you have a single string of characters that excludes the header and footer, and runs together such that every line of the key wraps to the next.
Base64-decode the public key to render a DER-formatted public-key.
Generate a SHA256 hex-digest of the DER-formatted key.
Take the first 32-bytes of the hash. You will not need the rest.
For each character, convert it to base-10, and add the ASCII code for 'a'.

The following is a Python routine to do this:
import hashlib
from base64 import b64decode

def build_id(pub_key_pem):
    pub_key_der = b64decode(pub_key_pem)
    sha = hashlib.sha256(pub_key_der).hexdigest()
    prefix = sha[:32]

    reencoded = """"
    ord_a = ord('a')
    for old_char in prefix:
        code = int(old_char, 16)
        new_char = chr(ord_a + code)

        reencoded += new_char

    return reencoded

def main():
    pub_key = 'MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCjvF5pjuK8gRaw/2LoRYi37QqRd48B/FeO9yFtT6ueY84z/u0NrJ/xbPFc9OCGBi8RKIblVvcbY0ySGqdmp0QsUr/oXN0b06GL4iB8rMhlO082HhMzrClV8OKRJ+eJNhNBl8viwmtJs3MN0x9ljA4HQLaAPBA9a14IUKLjP0pWuwIDAQAB'

    id_ = build_id(pub_key)
    print(id_)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

You're more than welcome to test this against an existing extension and its ID. To retrieve its PEM-formatted public-key:

Go into the list of your existing extensions in Chrome. Grab the extension-ID of one.
Find the directory where the extension is hosted. On my Windows 7 box, it is: C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions\
Grab the public-key from the manifest.json file under ""key"". Since the key is already ready to be base64-decoded, you can skip step (1) of the process.

The public-key in the example is from the ""Chrome Reader"" extension. Its extension ID is ""lojpenhmoajbiciapkjkiekmobleogjc"".

","A nice and simple way to get the public key from the .crx file using python, since chrome only generates the private .pem key for you. The public key is actually stored in the .crx file.
This is based on the format of the .crx file found here http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/crx.html
import struct
import hashlib
import string

def get_pub_key_from_crx(crx_file):
    with open(crx_file, 'rb') as f:
        data = f.read()
    header = struct.unpack('<4sIII', data[:16])
    pubkey = struct.unpack('<%ds' % header[2], data[16:16+header[2]])[0]
    return pubkey

def get_extension_id(crx_file):
    pubkey = get_pub_key_from_crx(crx_file)
    digest = hashlib.sha256(pubkey).hexdigest()

    trans = string.maketrans('0123456789abcdef', string.ascii_lowercase[:16])
    return string.translate(digest[:32], trans)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print 'usage: %s crx_file' % sys.argv[0]

    print get_extension_id(sys.argv[1])

Although this isn't possible to do ""bypassing interaction with the browser"", because you still need to generate the .crx file with a command like
chrome.exe --pack-extension=my_extension --pack-extension-key=my_extension.pem

","Starting with Chrome 64, Chrome changed the package format for extensions to the CRX₃ file format, which supports multiple signatures and explicitly declares its CRX ID. Extracting the CRX ID from a CRX₃ file requires parsing a protocol buffer.
Here is a small python script for extracting the ID from a CRX₃ file.
This solution should only be used with trusted CRX₃ files or in contexts where security is not a concern: unlike CRX₂, the package format does not restrict what CRX ID a CRX₃ file declares. (In practice, consumers of the file (i.e. Chrome) will place restrictions upon it, such as requiring the file to be signed with at least one key that hashes to the declared CRX ID).

","You can do that and if nobody gets the serverside salt, it's save. In the end it's email validation, and if you don't need to do it for legal reasons, there is no need to make it more complicated.
But it depends on your goals. Do want it to be extra safe? Do you want to be easy to implement? Do you want it easy to maintain? Are you thinking about execution time of your scripts?
BTW: One very nasty thing when having a long link in an email: There may be email cients which break your link, so maybe add the code along with the link and if the code is not completly transfered through the link, have a form where the user can add the code.

","A couple of things that might be worth a look (or not).
If someone finds out your salt, then they can reconstruct your hashes and flood your system.  In this case you'd want to make sure that a user requested addition of their e-mail address to whatever you're creating.  (That is, I wouldn't get rid of storing the hash in the DB altogether.)
Also, if the salt is the same, the hash will be the same if they request again from that same e-mail address.  Do you want a different hash each time a request is made, even for the same e-mail address?  You could concatenate the server date/time to the e-mail address before you hash it to make it different each time.

The trick is that the pack() PHP function for input hexadecimal string of the odd length shift it to the left,  i.e. add one zero to the right of the value. This is because it is only possible to calculate binary string for even-length input hexadecimal string.

","SHA 256 stands for Secure Hash Algorithm ! It will only produce the hash of a given file . You can't retrieve the original file from a given hash otherwise hash functions are useless.

"10235161","How to iteratively sha256 in Python using native lib (ie hashlib), using byte[] as input and not hex string","Background:  I have an iterative hash algorithm I need to compute from a Python script and a Java web application.
Psuedo code:
hash = sha256(raw)
for x=1 to 64000 hash = sha256(hash)

where hash is a byte array of length 32, and not a hex string of length 64.
The reason I want to keep it in bytes is because, though Python can convert to hex string in between each iteration and keep the processing time under a second, Java takes 3 seconds for the String overhead.
So, the Java code looks like this:
// hash one time...
byte[] result = sha256(raw.getBytes(""UTF-8""));

// then hash 64k-1 more times
for (int x = 0; x < 64000-1; x++) {
  result = sha256(result);
}

// hex encode and print result
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
Formatter formatter = new Formatter(sb);
for (int i=0; i<buf.length; i++) {
  formatter.format(""%02x"", buf[i]);
}
System.out.println(sb.toString());

And the Python code looks like this:
import hashlib

# hash 1 time...
hasher = hashlib.sha256()
hasher.update(raw)
digest = hasher.digest()

# then hash 64k-1 times
for x in range (0, 64000-1):
  # expect digest is bytes and not hex string
  hasher.update(digest) 
  digest = hasher.digest()
print digest.encode(""hex"")

The Python result calculated the hash on the hex representation of the first digest (String), rather than the raw digest bytes.  So, I get varying outputs.
","Method .update of hasher appends argument to previous text (Python docs). Instead you should create new hasher each time you want to compute digest.
import hashlib

# hash 1 time...
digest = hashlib.sha256(raw).digest()

# then hash 64k-1 times
for x in range(0, 64000-1):
  digest = hashlib.sha256(digest).digest()
print digest.encode(""hex"")

Now how do I programmatically (in Java) generate SHA-256 hashed passwords to insert into the database? I've seen many examples of generating SHA-256 hashes and converting the byte string to hex. But the part that is throwing me off is the beginning of the hash when using the digest tool. It always generates hashes with '$' in the beginning. When converting a hash programmatically and encoding in hex, there will never be '$' characters included in the output (since there is no '$' in hex, only 0-F). But Tomcat seems to work fine with the digest tool output (which includes the dollar signs).
","I just tested it and I guess Tomcat just strips off everything up to the second dollar sign from the digest tool output. So I can generate a SHA-256 hash hex string in Java using Apache Commons:
String sha256hex = org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils.sha256Hex(password);  

EDIT: so what is the significance of the '$' signs in the hash string that the digest tool is generating? I'm going to guess that it's salt-related?

also: tomcat recognizes the 2 $ signs in the userCredCol field when using digest. Without the $ it uses the unsalted version and that's is equal to a salt size of 0 with 1 iteration eg ""$1$hash"" or ""hash"" are identical.
ALSO: not all tomcats have the same digest version. pe unlike 8.0.26 the 8.0.14 does not have the possibility for sha-256 with salt. putting salted info in userCredCol wil obviously not work.

","You'd better use Data also for the result hash.
In Swift 3, withUnsafePointer(_:) and withUnsafeMutablePointer(:_) are generic types and Swift can infer the Pointee types correctly when used with ""well-formed"" closures, which means you have no need to convert Pointee types manually.
func withUnsafeBytes((UnsafePointer) -> ResultType)
func withUnsafeMutableBytes((UnsafeMutablePointer) -> ResultType)
func SHA256(data: String) -> Data {
    var hash = Data(count: Int(CC_SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH))

    if let newData: Data = data.data(using: .utf8) {
        _ = hash.withUnsafeMutableBytes {mutableBytes in
            newData.withUnsafeBytes {bytes in
                CC_SHA256(bytes, CC_LONG(newData.count), mutableBytes)
            }
        }
    }

    return hash
}

In Swift 3, the initializers of UnsafePointer and UnsafeMutablePointer, which was used to convert Pointee types till Swift 2, are removed. But in many cases, you can work without type conversions of pointers.

"6587125","SHA256 implementation using Base64 for input and output","I've been asked to develop the company's backoffice for the iPad and, while developing the login screen, I've ran into an issue with the authentication process.
The passwords are concatenated with a salt, hashed using SHA-256 and stored in the database.
The backoffice is Flash-based and uses the as3crypto library to hash then password+salt and my problem is that the current implementation uses Base64 for both input and output.
This site demonstrates how this can be done: just select Hash and select Base64 for both input and output format and fire away. So far, all my attempts have yielded different results from the ones this site (and the backoffice code) give me.
While I think that in theory it should be relatively simply:

Base64 encode the pass+salt
Hash it using SHA-256
Base64 encode the result again

so far I haven't been able to do this and I'm getting quite the headache to be honest.
My code is becoming a living maze, i'll have to redo-it tomorrow I reckon.
Any ideas?
Cheers and thanks in advance
PS: Here's the Backoffice's Flash code for generating hashed passwords by the way:
var currentResult:ByteArray;
var hash:IHash = Crypto.getHash('sha256');
var data:ByteArray = Base64.decodeToByteArray(str + vatel);
currentResult = hash.hash(data);
return Base64.encodeByteArray(currentResult).toString();

","The backoffice code does not do

Base64 encode the pass+salt
Hash it using SHA-256
Base64 encode the result again

(as you wrote above) 
Instead, what it does is 

Base64 decode the pass+salt string into a byte array
Hash the byte array using SHA-256
Base64 encode the byte array, returning a string 

As per step 1 above, it's a unclear what kind of character encoding the input strings uses. You need to make sure that both systems use the same encoding for the input strings! UTF8, UTF16-LE or UTF16-BE makes a world of a difference in this case! 
Start by finding out the correct character encoding to use on the iOS side. 
Oh, and Matt Gallagher has written an easy to use wrapper class for hashes to use on iOS, HashValue.m, I've used it with good results.

I basically wanted a signed REST request directly in the url (hence the header function) but left me stuck with the error. I double checked my access id and secret key so I know they are not the one causing the problem. Is this not the right way to produce the signature?
","It seems you're trying to use a V2 signature to call the REST API of AWS.

Thank you in advance for any help.
","If I had to guess, I'd say that changing 
line1 = source.readline()

to 
line1 = source.readline().strip()

will fix the problem. strip() removes leading and trailing whitespace, including the newline ('\n') character that will almost certainly be at the end of the first line read by readline.
You can see whether there are ""invisible"" characters like that by using repr, which renders them explicitly using escape characters:
>>> print repr('\t')
'\t'

Does an object of ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile return anything more than the contents of the uploaded file? When I generate the checksum of the uploaded file written to the file-system, it is matching with checksum2 (temporary file checksum) , not with checksum1 (UploadedFile.read).
I am assuming that the checksum generated by reading the temporary file from the filesystem is more reliable as the object (UploadedFile) implementation might change. If needed, it will be easier to generate checksums of existing files on the file system.
So, what is the reason for the difference of checksums and which one is more reliable?
Thank you.

Update 1:
As per @pablo-castellazzi suggestion i generated the hash by using Digest::SHA256.file(upload.path).hexdigest . Let us call this checksum3
This checksum3 equals checksum1 but differs from checksum2

Update 2: If i use the binary mode to read the file as mentioned by @Arsen7 , then all the checksums are equal.
","Have you compared the 'data1' and 'data2' contents? Try to save them to files and take a look.
I suppose, you may want to call upload.rewind before you do the first read, but the first thing is to take a look at the raw data read from the files.
Update:
You did not say that you are on Windows. In this case you should take care and read the files in so-called 'binary' mode.
Change the File.read method to something like this:
data2 = nil
File.open(upload.path, ""rb"") {|f| data2 = f.read }

(Implement Pablo Castellazzi suggestion of using .path method)
I was suggesting that you open the files in some binary-safe editor (vim, for example) and compare what differs. You would notice that maybe most of the data is the same, but in one of the files line endings are different, or maybe you would spot some other differences.
In case of Windows, the most popular problem is the binary mode.

","Assuming you are using Rails 3.x data1 checksum is correct. data2 content should be read with:
data2 = File.read(upload.path)

upload.tempfile is the instance holding the file object, not the path to the temporary file.

","Nitpick: ""random"" is the wrong word to use here, since hash functions are deterministic.
As for answering what you mean :), a desirable property of hash functions is achieving the Avalanche effect: basically, to have every bit of input cause drastic changes to the output. So, for a well-designed hash, every substring should be affected equally often (""be as random"") as any other.

Frequency test (monobit test)
Serial test (two-bit test)
Poker test

"2699903","Unable to verify body hash for DKIM","I'm writing a C# DKIM validator and have come across a problem that I cannot solve. Right now I am working on calculating the body hash, as described in Section 3.7 Computing the Message Hashes. I am working with emails that I have dumped using a modified version of EdgeTransportAsyncLogging sample in the Exchange 2010 Transport Agent SDK. Instead of converting the emails when saving, it just opens a file based on the MessageID and dumps the raw data to disk.
I am able to successfully compute the body hash of the sample email provided in Section A.2 using the following code:
SHA256Managed hasher = new SHA256Managed();
ASCIIEncoding asciiEncoding = new ASCIIEncoding();
string rawFullMessage = File.ReadAllText(@""C:\Repositories\Sample-A.2.txt"");
string headerDelimiter = ""\r\n\r\n"";
int headerEnd = rawFullMessage.IndexOf(headerDelimiter);
string header = rawFullMessage.Substring(0, headerEnd);
string body = rawFullMessage.Substring(headerEnd + headerDelimiter.Length);
byte[] bodyBytes = asciiEncoding.GetBytes(body);
byte[] bodyHash = hasher.ComputeHash(bodyBytes);
string bodyBase64 = Convert.ToBase64String(bodyHash);
string expectedBase64 = ""2jUSOH9NhtVGCQWNr9BrIAPreKQjO6Sn7XIkfJVOzv8="";
Console.WriteLine(""Expected hash: {1}{0}Computed hash: {2}{0}Are equal: {3}"",
  Environment.NewLine, expectedBase64, bodyBase64, expectedBase64 == bodyBase64);

The output from the above code is:
Expected hash: 2jUSOH9NhtVGCQWNr9BrIAPreKQjO6Sn7XIkfJVOzv8=
Computed hash: 2jUSOH9NhtVGCQWNr9BrIAPreKQjO6Sn7XIkfJVOzv8=
Are equal: True

Now, most emails come across with the c=relaxed/relaxed setting, which requires you to do some work on the body and header before hashing and verifying. And while I was working on it (failing to get it to work) I finally came across a message with c=simple/simple which means that you process the whole body as is minus any empty CRLF at the end of the body. (Really, the rules for Body Canonicalization are quite ... simple.)
Here is the real DKIM email (right click and save it, the browsers eat the ending CRLF) with a signature using the simple algorithm (completely unmodified). Now, using the above code and updating the expectedBase64 hash I get the following results:
Expected hash: VnGg12/s7xH3BraeN5LiiN+I2Ul/db5/jZYYgt4wEIw=
Computed hash: ISNNtgnFZxmW6iuey/3Qql5u6nflKPTke4sMXWMxNUw=
Are equal: False

The expected hash is the value from the bh= field of the DKIM-Signature header. Now, the file used in the second test is a direct raw output from the Exchange 2010 Transport Agent. If so inclined, you can view the modified EdgeTransportLogging.txt.
At this point, no matter how I modify the second email, changing the start position or number of CRLF at the end of the file I cannot get the files to match. What worries me is that I have been unable to validate any body hash so far (simple or relaxed) and that it may not be feasible to process DKIM through Exchange 2010.
","I tried this in python-dkim and I get a body hash mismatch too.
I think probably Exchange's GetMimeReadStream is not giving you the actual bytes as they were transmitted, therefore the hash doesn't match.  Probably it's disassembling the message into its mime parts, and then GetMimeReadStream gives you a valid representation of the message, but not the one it was originally sent with.
Perhaps there's another API that will give you the real raw bytes?
Or perhaps by this point in the process the message has been torn apart and the original message thrown away, and you need to hook in earlier.
Probably you should try intercepting a DKIM-signed message by sending it to a non-Exchange server, and see if that works with your code.  GetContentReadStream might possibly work?
Anyhow, what I would do next is try to find an API that gives you byte-for-byte what was sent.

The corresponding string for SHA256 is HMACSHA256

Then pass this object to the ComputeSignature method.

The code should be as follows:
KeyedHashAlgorithm kha = KeyedHashAlgorithm.Create(""HMACSHA256"");
signedXml.ComputeSignature(kha);

We are creating the client/server/root certificates using orapki utility and putting the certificates in oracle wallet.
It seems the default hash algorithm for encryption, when we create certificates using orapki utility (in oracle 11g db) is md5. This was working fine, until we upgraded to jdk1.7 u101. This version of jdk no longer supports MD5. So it seems we need to use SHA-256 as the hash algorithm. I keep getting references that oracle wallet manager 11.2.0.1+ supports SHA-256, but I cannot find any documentation on how to specify SHA-256 as the hash algorithm while creating the certificates. 
Is there a way I can generate certificates through orapki/wallet manager with SHA-256 as the hash algorithm?
","You can use orapki with -sign_alg sha256 to sign your certificates with sha256 instead of md5.
For example: Creating a self signed certificate used as the trusted authority
orapki wallet create -wallet ./root -pwd welcome123 -nologo
orapki wallet remove -trusted_cert_all -wallet ./root -pwd welcome123  -nologo
orapki wallet add -wallet ./root -dn CN=Certification\ Authority\ For\ Testing,\ O=MyCompany,\ C=US -keysize 2048 -self_signed -validity 7300 -pwd welcome123 -sign_alg sha256  -nologo

","On your first question, the answer would be that it is by design - the SHA-256 algorithm is intended to take an arbitrary amount of input data and produce 256 bits of output, whilst also maintaining certain properties that make for an effective cryptographic hash. Other hash algorithms produce different output sizes (e.g. SHA-1 produces 160 bits of output, SHA-512 produces 512 bits of output, etc.).
Your second question is based on an incorrect assumption - the computation time is dependent on the size of the input - it will naturally take longer even just to read say, a 1MB file than it would to read a 1KB file, and since the hash is dependent on every bit of the input, a larger input will take longer to hash than a smaller one.

(I am trying to implement the SHA-256 hash function in C++. I am doing this purely for fun and learning purposes.)
I have my string message with length message_length. I have appended the string with the bit 1 followed by 0s so that the length of the string is now 448 bits mod 512 bits. 
I now need to append the string with the message_length as 64-bit big-endian integer to the string, but I can't quite figure out how to do this in C++.
For sake of argument then, lets say message_length is 3 bytes = 24 bits. 24 in hex is 18, so I would need to append 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 18 to the string.
So what I would like is a function that converts the integer 3 into the string 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 18 so that I can append this.
My question boils down to

How can I convert a 64bit integer to a big-endian byte array in C++

","Edit: I just reread your question (in the intend to edit it). I think you misunderstood the format SHA256 expects you to use. Instead of appending the string 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 18 (each byte hex encoded and separated by spaces) for a message length of 24 you need to append the raw bytes 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 and 0x18. They do not represent any printable characters. See below for a way to get these bytes. My example uses an integer whose byte representation happens to contain only printable characters (in ASCII).
Btw., the reason you pad to 448 bits is that you have 64 bits left in the full block size of 512 bits so you can put the big-endian encoding of the message length in there.

You can extract a single byte of num using num>>(8*i) & 0xff where you will get the least significant byte for i=0 and the most significant byte of an unsigned long (64bit) with i=7. Iterating through all positions you can get each byte:
   unsigned long num = 0x626967656e646961L;
   //Store big endian representation in a vector:
   std::vector<unsigned char> bigEndian;
   for(int i=7; i>=0; i--){
      bigEndian.push_back( (num>>(8*i)) & 0xff );
   }

If you need it as a string you can convert it using the iterator constructor of a string:
   std::string bigEndianString(bigEndian.begin(),bigEndian.end());

Complete code with test output:
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
int main() {
   unsigned long num = 0x626967656e646961L;

   //Store big endian representation in a vector:
   std::vector<unsigned char> bigEndian;
   for(int i=7; i>=0; i--){
      bigEndian.push_back( (num>>(8*i)) & 0xff );
   }

   //Convert vector to string:
   std::string bigEndianString(bigEndian.begin(),bigEndian.end());

   //Test correctness:
   for(std::vector<unsigned char>::const_iterator it = bigEndian.begin(); it != bigEndian.end(); ++it) {
       std::cout << std::hex << (int)*it << ' ';
   }
   std::cout << std::endl << bigEndianString << std::endl;

"12688502","Length of the result of SHA256 algo","I'm curious why the result of SHA256 can be saved within a binary(32), but it needs a varchar(64) for the same result to be saved.
I mean, 256 bits are 32 bytes, so, saving inside a binary(32) makes perfect sense. But then why trying to save it in a varchar requires an extra byte for each byte?
","Let's start at the beginning and see what a cryptographic function is and what it's output actually is: 

A cryptographic hash function is a hash function, that is, an
  algorithm that takes an arbitrary block of data and returns a
  fixed-size bit string, the (cryptographic) hash value.

That means that we obtain sequence of 1s and 0s back. In order to save that sequence correctly, you have to use MySQL's binary data-type column since it doesn't save any data about how to represent the saved data to the user - there is no encoding associated with it. That means that when you try to view the data, you'll most likely see garbled characters since the GUI programs will attempt to represent the value stored as an ASCII-encoded string (which is wrong).
I'll skip the reasons why the hash value is represented as a number, but the point is that it is. And it's a hexadecimal number. Let's take the 1st byte that you used: 
10101111 = that's decimal 175 or hexadecimal AF.
Sure, you can represent ASCII 175 as something, it will most likely be a weird character depending on the codepage being used. Problem with ASCII is that codes above 127 are arbitrary, which lead to inventing codepages, which lead to inventing Unicode etc. so I'll skip it for now. 
Point is, you can't rely on ASCII displaying 10101111 correctly in every scenario.
That means that 175 will have to be displayed using 3 bytes, not 1. Why? Because each character in 175 has to be displayed using its own byte.
That means that you can display your hash value as decimal number. That also means you can display your number as a hexadecimal number, which is significantly shorter to represent. 
Let's take 10101111 again.
In decimal it's 175, takes 3 bytes to show it on screen - 1 for 1, 1 for 7 and 1 for 5.
In hexadecimal it's AF, takes 2 bytes to show it on screen - significantly shorter. 
Each byte when translated to hex number has at least 2 digits (there are leading zeroes). With decimal numbers that's not the case, so you know that every time you want to represent 1 byte as a hex number - you'd have at least 2 digits. Ergo, your message is fixed width, it uses digits 0-9, letters A-F which are at the same position in every ASCII code page, ergo they'll look the same. 
So when you take AF and display it in ASCII, you need 1 byte for A and 1 byte for F.
There are 32 numbers, each has 2 digits, 32x2 = 64 bytes. 
The only mistake you probably did was using varchar(64). Using varchar for storing hashes is useless, if you know the hash width. Using char would be much better because you wouldn't waste that 1 byte that varchar column uses.
Hopefully, this clears it up a bit. It's actually more simple than it sounds :)

","Looks like this can be done (although in this case it's not SHA256). 
The following is an example of a JavaScript library that uses WebGL2 to calculate hash values on the client side, for the Curl hashing algoritm: 
https://github.com/iotaledger/curl.lib.js/
In this case it's used to do Proof of Work for an IOTA transaction (https://www.iota.org/get-started/what-is-iota). This basically comes down to brute-forcing random inputs into the same hash function until the result matches a certain output. Therefore the gained hashing speed by using WebGL is very relevant.

I'm trying to implement SHA256 in my iOS app in order to beef up security between the app and the server, but the encoding part is giving me a headache...
I'm using an NSData category:

NSMutableData *out = [NSMutableData dataWithLength:CC_SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH];

CC_SHA256(data.bytes, data.length,  out.mutableBytes);

if ( CC_SHA256(data.bytes, data.length, out.mutableBytes) ) return out;

","Sorry that I'm very late to the party.
The result you get from php is the concatenation of the hexadecimal values of each byte. The value you got from ios is the actual byte string.
I suspect you are using something like [[NSString alloc] initWithData:theData encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] to get the string.
But you should convert NSData to the form you require using [data description] as described in How can i convert NSdata to hex string?.

"22220344","PHP and C# SHA256 Hashes returning different strings","So, I found a question just like this with an accepted answer, so I hopped off and tried to implement the necessary changes. For some reason though, I am still getting two different strings, and I don't know what it is I'm doing wrong. I tried to comment on the accepted answer to find help, but I lack the reputation to do so. So, I figured I'd ask the question again (that question was 2 years old, too).
Let me explain what I'm doing.
In php...
$intermediatesalt = md5(uniqid(rand(), true));
$salt = substr($intermediatesalt, 0, 8);
$hashpassword = base64_encode(
hash('sha256', $salt . hash('sha256', $password), true)
);

The line that says $hashpassword was taken from the accepted answer from this question. I didn't write any of this php, my friend did. I only know enough about programming to alter the code, but I couldn't create anything in php, let alone HTML.
After the hash has been created, both the hash and the salt are stored on a database.
The C# method I'm using is also from the answer I found here.
    public static string ComputeHash(string plainText, string salt)
    {
        // Convert plain text into a byte array.
        byte[] plainTextBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(plainText);
        byte[] saltBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(salt);

        SHA256Managed hash = new SHA256Managed();

        // Compute hash value of salt.
        byte[] plainHash = hash.ComputeHash(plainTextBytes);

        byte[] concat = new byte[plainHash.Length + saltBytes.Length];

        System.Buffer.BlockCopy(saltBytes, 0, concat, 0, saltBytes.Length);
        System.Buffer.BlockCopy(plainHash, 0, concat, saltBytes.Length, plainHash.Length);

        byte[] tHashBytes = hash.ComputeHash(concat);

        // Convert result into a base64-encoded string.
        string hashValue = Convert.ToBase64String(tHashBytes);

        // Return the result.
        return hashValue;
    }

But for some bizarre reason, even though the person who asked the question got what s/he wanted, I am still getting an undesired result.
This is the block of code that loads player data then compares the the php generated hashed password with the c# generated hashed password.
        // load the player based on the given email
        PlayerStructure.Player newPlayer = MySQL.loadPlayer(email);

        // compute a hash based on the given password and the retrieved salt
        // then, compare it to the hashed password on the database
        string hPassword = Program.ComputeHash(password, newPlayer.salt);

        if (newPlayer.password != hPassword)

        }

MySQL.loadPlayer loads the hash string and the salt string from the database, and I had to use those sendStatusMessage methods to print strings as this is for a server application that takes up to 15 minutes to load data from the database in debug mode. So I run the debug exe instead, ergo no Console.WriteLine calls. newPlayer.password is the hashed password stored on the database (the password created with php). hPassword is the computed hash using the C# method I borrowed.
The salt is e0071fa9 and the plain-text password is 'test'.
This is the result I get with the sendStatusMsg methods:
Invalid password.

In fact why are there two hashes in the first place? The inner hash doesn't seem to serve any purpose at all.

","The work that you're doing is inherently synchronous CPU bound work.  It's not inherently asynchronous as something like network IO is going to be.  If you would like to run some synchronous CPU bound work in another thread and asynchronously wait for it to be completed, then Task.Run is indeed the proper tool to accomplish that, assuming the operation is sufficiently long running to need to perform it asynchronously.
That said, there really isn't any reason to expose an asynchronous wrapper over your synchronous method.  It generally makes more sense to just expose the method synchronously, and if a particular caller needs it to run asynchronously in another thread, they can use Task.Run to explicitly indicate that need for that particular invocation.

","As stated by the other answerers, hashing is a CPU-bound activity so it doesn't have Async methods you can call. You can, however, make your hashing method async by asynchronously reading the file block by block and then hashing the bytes you read from the file. The hashing will be done synchronously but the read will be asynchronous and consequently your entire method will be async.
Here is sample code for achieving the purpose I just described.
public static async Threading.Tasks.Task<string> GetHashAsync<T>(this Stream stream) 
    where T : HashAlgorithm, new()
{
    StringBuilder sb;

    using (var algo = new T())
    {
        var buffer = new byte[8192];
        int bytesRead;

        // compute the hash on 8KiB blocks
        while ((bytesRead = await stream.ReadAsync(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) != 0)
            algo.TransformBlock(buffer, 0, bytesRead, buffer, 0);
        algo.TransformFinalBlock(buffer, 0, bytesRead);

        // build the hash string
        sb = new StringBuilder(algo.HashSize / 4);
        foreach (var b in algo.Hash)
            sb.AppendFormat(""{0:x2}"", b);
    }

    return sb?.ToString();
}

The function can be invoked as such 
using (var stream = System.IO.File.OpenRead(@""C:\path\to\file.txt""))
    string sha256 = await stream.GetHashAsync<SHA256CryptoServiceProvider>();

Of course,you could equally call the method with other hash algorithms such as SHA1CryptoServiceProvider or SHA512CryptoServiceProvider as the generic type parameter.
Likewise with a few modifications, you can also get it to hash a string as is specific to your case.

","The ruby code you want is just 
require 'digest'
hash   = Digest::SHA256.hexdigest(""xyz"")

hexdigest takes as argument the string to digest, so what your previous code was doing was digesting the string (returning as a raw array of 32 bytes), and then computing the SHA256 of that & formatting as 64 hex characters.
The ruby digest library does also have an api similar to your python example:
hash = Digest::SHA256.new
hash.update 'xyz'
hash.hexdigest

For when you want to compute a hash incrementally

","You just need to hash what the user typed in exactly the same way that you hashed the password when you stored it. Then, if the hashed password from the database matches the hashed password that the user just typed in, they typed the correct password.
Usually there is a random salt involved so if multiple people use the password ""password"" the hashed password won't look the same in the database. That has nothing to do with your current question, but should definitely be something you look into before you consider your ""storing passwords"" solution complete.
Here's an example of some code you might use:
byte[] passwordBytes = Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(userTypedPassword);
//
// This is where you'd normally append or prepend the salt bytes
//
var hasher = System.Security.CryptographySHA256.Create();
byte[] hashedBytes = hasher.ComputeHash(passwordBytes);

Now it depends on how the hash is stored in the database, if it's just binary data you can compare the byte arrays. If it's stored as a base64 string, you can convert the bytes:
var hashedString = Convert.ToBase64String(hashedBytes);

...and then do a string comparison between the stored string and hashedString.

Now, I need to change the hash algorithm to SHA256 and as far as I know PasswordDeriveBytes accepts only MD5 and SHA1 as hash parameters. I just want to know if I can use PasswordDeriveBytes for implementing SHA256. 
If not, whats the alternative inbuilt class in .NET for the same purpose? Can I implement it manually? If implementing manually is the only solution, I may need help doing that. Thanks in advance.
","The alternative is Rfc2898DeriveBytes. It is much safer to use, especially if you require more than 20 bytes of output. It is of course not compatible with PasswordDeriveBytes. PasswordDeriveBytes is simply broken for any value over 20 bytes. Unfortunately PBKDF2 also has a drawback: it repeats all the iterations for any value over the hash size. In that case you may want to pair it with a KBKDF.
So it seems you cannot do this without reverting to an additional library. That's where Bouncy Castle may come it. It has a PBKDF2 functionality that you can simply initialize with a HMAC, which in turn you can initialize with a given hash algorithm. Please see the use of PBKDF2 in this stackoverflow question. You can simply replace the digest with Sha256Digest and you should be on your way.
Note: nothing is simple in crypto, it seems you need the bouncy source to achieve this.

Questions:

Is the hex encoding method correct?
Am I missing something with regards to encoding?

","A byte value is signed, and you are using the signed-preserving right-shift. This will result in negative values for b when computing the high-order nybble.
For example, consider what your code does with a byte value -112 (0x90). When right-shifting, it is first promoted to an int value, 0xFFFFFF90. Then it is shifted right 4 bits, preserving the sign, and becomes 0xFFFFFFF9. This is then cast back to a byte, which simply discards the high-order 24 bits, and 0xF9 (-7 decimal) is assigned to b. b is not greater than 9, so the resulting character is (-7 + 48), or ')'.
Do this instead:
int hi = (barray[i] & 0xF0) >>> 4, lo = barray[i] & 0xF;

"9162824","SHA256 hashed password validation in javascript","I'm trying to convert a c# program into javascript. 
The purpose is to validate a clear text password against its sha-256 hash stored in a database. This code will be executed server-side.
The c# program was implemented following this MSDN's article How to Hash Passwords. 
In order to validate my implementation, I was given an example hash for the password ""test"" with a randomly generated 4 characters long salt .
Here is what I wrote so far :
var unhashedPass = ""test"";
var originalHashedPass = ""F27B595D3CBBC60ACEAC68E4DA6A2629558FEC383E0B81F764E443C68B0E9808096CDF2D"";

var saltStringLength = 4;
var unicodeCharLength = 2;
var saltHexLength = unicodeCharLength * saltStringLength;
var saltHex = originalHashedPass.substr(0, saltHexLength);

var strSalt1 = String.fromCharCode(parseInt(saltHex.substr(0, 2), 16).toFixed());
var strSalt2 = String.fromCharCode(parseInt(saltHex.substr(2, 2), 16).toFixed());
var strSalt3 = String.fromCharCode(parseInt(saltHex.substr(4, 2), 16).toFixed());
var strSalt4 = String.fromCharCode(parseInt(saltHex.substr(6, 2), 16).toFixed());

//var strSalt = str2rstr_utf16le(strSalt1 + strSalt2 + strSalt3 + strSalt4);
var strSalt = strSalt1 + strSalt2 + strSalt3 + strSalt4;

var finalHash = saltHex + hex_sha256(strSalt + unhashedPass).toUpperCase();

return (finalHash == originalHashedPass);

This code is one of multiple variants I tried, attempting to transform the hexadecimal salt in a valid string (see commented line for example). None seemed to work.
hex_sha256 and str2rstr_utf16le functions come from this javascript SHA implementation 
I assume the c# part I fail to correctly ""translate"" in javascript is the conversion of the salt into a string.
binarySaltValue[0] = byte.Parse(saltValue.Substring(0, 2), System.Globalization.NumberStyles.HexNumber, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture.NumberFormat);
binarySaltValue[1] = byte.Parse(saltValue.Substring(2, 2), System.Globalization.NumberStyles.HexNumber, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture.NumberFormat);
binarySaltValue[2] = byte.Parse(saltValue.Substring(4, 2), System.Globalization.NumberStyles.HexNumber, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture.NumberFormat);
binarySaltValue[3] = byte.Parse(saltValue.Substring(6, 2), System.Globalization.NumberStyles.HexNumber, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture.NumberFormat);

I noticed that the c# implementation uses array of bytes but I guess I have to use strings in javascript.
I also wonder if my issue has something to do with the fact that the c# program is computing Unicode encoded strings. 
Do you have any suggestion ?

EDIT
To clarify my problem : I can't manage to validate in javascript the password ""test"" against it's SHA256 salted hash ""F27B595D3CBBC60ACEAC68E4DA6A2629558FEC383E0B81F764E443C68B0E9808096CDF2D"" (calculated earlier in a c# program).
","Since you're saying this is server side, I'm guessing Node, in which case:
https://github.com/brainfucker/hashlib
If it's something other than node:
https://github.com/h2non/jsHashes
but that will be slower than the first one since it's a pure JS implementation (the first is in C exposed to JS)

What part/s of the file are used when the hash is created?
Ok, zero tolerance was a bit much, if the hash doesn't match the file will have to be resent.
","First, a general recommendation: don't do this. Use rsync or something similar to do bulk file transfers. Rsync has years of optimisations and debugging behind it, has countless options to control how (and whether) the copying happens, and is available on Windows. Don't waste time building something that has already been built.
But if you must…
Hashing algorithms generally care about bytes, not files. When applying SHA256 to a file, you are simply reading the bytes and passing them through the algo.
If you want to hash paths, permissions, etc, you should do this at the directory level, because these things constitute the ""contents"" of a directory. There is no standard byte-level representation of directories, so you'll have make one up yourself. Something that looks like a directory listing in sorted order usually suffices. And make sure that each entry contains the hash of the corresponding thing, be it a file or another directory. This way, the hash of the directory uniquely specifies not only the name and attributes of each child, but, recursively, the entire contents of the subdirectory.
Note: the fact that identical files have the same hash can actually work in your favour, by avoiding transmission of the second file once the system realises that a file with the same hash is already present at the destination. Of course, you would have to code for this explicitly. But also note that doing so can allow super-cheap syncing when files have been moved or copied, since they will have the same hash as before. Only affected directories (from the immediate parent(s) to the root) will have different hash values.
Finally, a minor quibble: there is no such thing as zero tolerance. Forget whether SHA256 collisions will happen in the lifetime of the Universe. A gamma ray can flip the bit that says, ""These two files don't match!"" Such flippings happen exceedingly rarely, but more often than you might think. In a noisy quantum universe, we should avoid talking in absolutes.

","All your process is asynchronous. While it's good practice in javascript, you should keep control of your memory consumption:

You start opening your files asynchronously with fs.stat. Which means ALL your files.
Then you load them in memory using buffers, but you can't start processing them until they're completely loaded an hit the on('end',..). Which means ALL your files are competing to be FULLY loaded in your RAM.

Got it? Your memory usage is 100% and you have to hope a file got fully loaded and processed to release some memory for another one. That's what you're doing wrong.
So you need to get your memory usage back under control. Ideally, you should control how many files are processed at once. As a quick fix, I suggest you make it synchronous with fs.statSync.

Side notes
Your process also involves a database. That's the usual suspect for performance. Your code must log any db error. Here I see no potential deadlock or full scan. So no worries. Just make sure your table files is created before you start inserting.
Never use for..in to loop into an array. Use array.forEach() instead.
Please use semi-columns ; in your code. Yes, JavaScript most of the time can do without, but it will avoid you weird bugs and ease interpreter's job.

Sha-256 is a one way hashing function meaning that it uses your input as a seed and returns an output of fixed length (in this case 256 bits). The algorithm is deterministic and seemingly random. This means that for any given input it will return the same output but when put up against statistical testing there is no correlation between the input and output.

Reversing the actual SHA-256 algorithm: not feasible, and not the way to go around when attempting to crack a given hashed password
It's (near) impossible for you to reverse the hash; hash cracking is instead focused of 

finding the hash algorithm, including salts,
followed by the brute-force method of hashing probable passwords and attempting to match the resulting hashes with some hash that you intend to ""crack"". 

If we'll, for the discussion, assume all hash algorithms as non-reversable, and instantly identifiable, the the strength of the hash will roughly depend of the complexity of the hashing algorithm; in the sense that re-hashing (as performed when attempting dictionary attacks etc) with a more sophisticated hash method such as SHA-256 will be orders of time slower than when re-hashing is performed using a naive non-salted hashing algorithm, say non-salted MD5.
There's no harm in roughly learning ""the hows"", and I suggest reading this excellent Ars Technica article on the subject:

ARS Technica - 
How I became a password cracker - Cracking passwords is officially a ""script kiddie"" activity now.

As well as this excellent security.SE Q&A

Collecting relevant additional information from the comments to your question (as these might not persist the tide of time):

As @Specte points out, a relevant thread worth visting is:

Are there any SHA-256 javascript implementations that are generally considered trustworthy?

Regarding the subject of why reversing hash algorithms is infeasible, you've pointed to a relevant security.SE thread yourself:

Why are hash functions one way? If I know the algorithm, why can't I calculate the input from it?

This works fine. It encrypts. Decryption via the same method works fine too. HOWEVER, it defaults to Triple DES encryption. This is what the encrypted version of the machine key gives me:
<machineKey configProtectionProvider=""RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider"">
      ...

We don't want that. We want ASPNET_REGIIS to be encrypting with AES 256. My research so far tells me this can be done by specifying a ""ProtectedConfigurationProvider"" using the /PROV argument on the encryption script. This should make reference to an encryption provider in:
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Config\machine.config
I currently only have one provider in there, the default (RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider), which appears to be the one using Triple DES.
Does anyone have an idea of what steps need to be taken to get the machineKey encrypted via ASPNET_REGIIS using AES 256? Have I got something here terribly wrong?

    else

Your problem is, you are setting $raw_output to true in string hash_final ( HashContext $context [, bool $raw_output = FALSE ] ), which will generate the output as raw binary data. Either set it to false or don't use it at all, because it defaults to false (see the doc). Hope this helps.

","I got this working locally. Looks like you're double encoding your signature. 
the steps for creating a signature are:

create the initial string that forms the basis of the signature
decode your secret to get a KeySpec (new SecretKeySpec())
init your HMAC with the keyspec (sha256Hmac.init())
use the secret to encode the request signature (sha256Hmac.doFinal())
base64 encode the result of step 4.

The only error you've made in the above snippet is to then base64 encode it again in your headers.

","In order to load only the hashers which have been explicitly requested, Passlib plays a dynamic import trick: passlib.hash is actually a special object which only imports each hasher class when requested ... the real hasher classes are actually stored in modules over in passlib's internal package passlib.handlers (in particular, passlib.hash:sha256_crypt is actually stored under passlib.handlers.sha2_crypt:sha256_crypt). 
Py2exe on the other hand try to be smart, and tries to walk your application's import tree, and only bundle the modules which are actually loaded. I find it frequently (and understandably) fouls up whenever it runs into a python package pulling dynamic import tricks (like the above). This ends up with the py2exe-packaged apps giving strange and hard to track down import errors. 
I'm not positive this will fix your problem, but the easiest solution I know of is to tell py2exe to include the entire passlib package, and not bother trying to ""guess"" which parts should be included. This can be done by adding ""passlib"" to py2exe's packages option...

Thanks for you time
","I see the issues:

Cipher mode (CBC in android code) isn't specified on iOS
Algorithm is specified explicitly on iOS (AES128), and not on Android
Algorithm does not accord to the key size on iOS 128/256.
Initial vector is different

So, instead of
CCCryptorStatus cryptStatus = CCCrypt(kCCEncrypt, kCCAlgorithmAES128, kCCOptionPKCS7Padding,
                                  keyPtr, kCCKeySizeAES256,

                                  &numBytesEncrypted);
 if (cryptStatus == kCCSuccess) {
     //the returned NSData takes ownership of the buffer and will free it on deallocation
     return [NSData dataWithBytesNoCopy:buffer length:numBytesEncrypted];
 }

I would try
char iv[kCCBlockSizeAES128 + 1]; bzero(iv, sizeof(iv))
CCCryptorStatus cryptStatus = CCCrypt(kCCEncrypt, kCCAlgorithmAES, kCCOptionPKCS7Padding,
                                  keyPtr, kCCKeySizeAES128,
                                  iv,

const key = crypto.createHmac('sha256', data).digest('hex');

Now, tweetnacl throws the error: bad key size when the key is passed in the secretbox:
nacl.secretbox(data, Rnonc, key);

The parameters are converted into Uint8Array since the secretbox requires arguments to be Uint8Array.
The error: bad key size is throw from here in tweetnacl since the crypto_secretbox_KEYBYTES is defined as 32 here. The problem is the key returned from crypto is in not 32 bytes size. 
I have searched SO and relevant sites, but couldn't find any feasible solution but according to this - the SHA256 hash converted to hex produces: 

32 separate hexadecimal numbers (or 32 bytes)

How can I generate a SHA256 key of 32 bytes in order to avoid this error using node.js? Is there something I am doing wrong in generating the SHA256 hash? 
","The following code snippet solved the issue of generating a 32 bytes SHA256 hash avoiding the bad key size error thrown from tweetnacl.js:
const CryptoJS = require('crypto-js');

let hash   = CryptoJS.SHA256('hello world');
let buffer = Buffer.from(hash.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex), 'hex');
let array  = new Uint8Array(buffer);

This always generates a Uint8Array of 32 bytes size. Notice here I had to use the crypto-js module although I preferred to use the native crypto module but I guess I would just use it for now as it is a working solution.

"6846876","sha256 hash PHP and store on MySQL","Right now I have a website which allows users to upload a file which gets stored in a local directory on my server.  After the file has been uploaded, I preform a bunch of quite expensive operations to generate an HTML file for the user (using two java programs).  Because these operations are so expensive, I now want to be able to use SHA256 to keep a database of every file which has been uploaded.  That way, if someone uploads a file and that file has already been processed, I don't have to process it again I can just display the existing HTML.
In order to know for sure that the HTML that is associated to a file is up to date, I would also like to have the version of two java programs which I run on the file associated with the hashed value.
So the logic goes like this: 
  1. A user submits a file.
  2. If the file is not already on the server, business as usual.
  3. If it is, check which versions of the two java programs it used to generate the html
  4. If the current version is newer, regenerate the html.
I don't know a lot about SHA or MySQL so any help would be much appreciated.  Really the questions boils down to this: How can I store a bunch of hashed value and its two version identifiers on a MySQL database and retrieve that information later.
If the question is unclear let me know so I can clear up confusion.
Thanks!
","hash_file() can create a sha256 hash of the file.
For the db, I would imagine a table as follows
Table name: File_Hash with the columns 'id' {PK, AI, int}, 'hash' {text}, 'engine' {int}, 'filepath' {varchar}
With this layout you can store a reference to the file in 'filepath', the sha256 file hash in 'hash' and identify the java program used in 'engine' (1 for the first java program, 2 for the other).

openssl genrsa -out dkimprivatekey.pem 1024

Generate the public. On Unix:

openssl rsa -in dkimprivatekey.pem -out public.pem -pubout

","Technically, yes.  Depending on what kind of key you have the answer gets more tricky.
Edit (2019-Oct): .NET Core 3.0 has built-in support for all of these formats, in their DER-encoded (vs PEM-encoded) forms.  I'm adding the .NET Core 3.0+ answers after a sub-heading within each file format.
PKCS#8 PrivateKeyInfo (PEM ""BEGIN PRIVATE KEY"")
If you have this type of file, and you're on .NET 4.6 or higher, then yes.  You need to have the DER encoded (vs PEM encoded) data blob (see below if it's PEM).
using (CngKey key = CngKey.Import(blob, CngKeyBlobFormat.Pkcs8PrivateBlob))
using (RSA rsa = new RSACng(key))
{
    return rsa.SignData(data, HashAlgorithmName.SHA256, RSASignaturePadding.Pkcs1);
}

4.6 is required for for RSA, 4.6.1 for ECDSA, 4.6.2 for DSA.
.NET Core 3.0+ PKCS#8 PrivateKeyInfo
The ImportPkcs8PrivateKey method is declared on AsymmetricAlgorithm, and all asymmetric built-in types (RSA, DSA, ECDsa, ECDiffieHellman) support it.
using (RSA rsa = RSA.Create())
{
    rsa.ImportPkcs8PrivateKey(blob, out _);
    return rsa.SignData(data, HashAlgorithmName.SHA256, RSASignaturePadding.Pkcs1);
}

PKCS#8 EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo (PEM ""BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY"")
Congratulations, your private key transport is strong.  Sadly, this requires the maximum amount of code to be written if you want to actually handle it.  You don't want to handle it. You really, really, want to 

Create a certificate for the key
Put the cert and key into a PFX file
Load the PFX into an X509Certificate2
Use cert.GetRSAPrivateKey(), cert.GetDSAPrivateKey(), or cert.GetECDsaPrivateKey() (as appropriate)

See How is a private key encrypted in a pem certificate?, and then continue to the next section for the primer on the hard way.  You have a lot more work than it will talk about, though.  You need to read the file, understand the encryption scheme and parameters, decrypt the blob, then use CNG for reading the PKCS#8, or just keep diving down the rabbit hole and enjoy your file parser.
.NET Core 3.0+ PKCS#8 EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo
The ImportEncryptedPkcs8PrivateKey method is declared on AsymmetricAlgorithm, and all asymmetric built-in types (RSA, DSA, ECDsa, ECDiffieHellman) support it.
using (RSA rsa = RSA.Create())
{
    rsa.ImportEncryptedPkcs8PrivateKey(password, blob, out _);
    return rsa.SignData(data, HashAlgorithmName.SHA256, RSASignaturePadding.Pkcs1);
}

PKCS#1 RSAPrivateKey (PEM ""BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY"")
You're at the unfortunate confluence of ""relatively simple"" and ""relatively hard"" that is known to math majors as ""an exercise left to the reader"".
Strongly consider doing the PFX approach from EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo.  Alternatively, you can do this in custom code.  Custom code? Okay, let's do this. The reference texts that you need at this point are

ITU.T-REC X.680-201508.


This defines the ASN.1 language, which tells you how to read the RSAPrivateKey (et al) object structure definition.
For RSAPrivateKey this is mostly optional, since there aren't many nuances to SEQUENCE that it uses, and INTEGER is pretty straightforward.

ITU.T-REC X.690-201508

This document describes the BER (and CER) and DER encoding rules for ASN.1.
These key files are in DER.  (Unless they're in PEM, but we'll fix that soon)

The RFC appropriate to your object type.


RSAPrivateKey (RFC 3447)
EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo (RFC 5208)
PrivateKeyInfo (also RFC 5208)
Other formats are in other RFCs.


Okay, let's proceed.

If the file is PEM encoded (""-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"" or ""-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----"", etc) you need to ""un-PEM"" it.


The PEM format is


(newline or beginning of file)
5 hyphens, BEGIN, space, the type identifier, 5 hyphens, a newline
a base64-encoded payload (with newlines after every 72 text characters)
a newline (unless you ended with a newline because you were a multiple of 72 text characters)
5 hyphens, END, the same type identifier as before, 5 hyphens

The part we want is the payload.  Run it through Convert.FromBase64String, and now we have the DER-encoded byte[] for the key object.

Using the type definition and the ITU documents, write a parser for your key file format.
Parse the key.
Convert the parsed key to an RSAParameters object (or DSAParameters, or ECParameters, as appropriate)
Call RSA.Create() (etc)
Load the key via the ImportParameters method.
Good to go.

For step 4, there are some things to be careful about.  Specifically, the ASN.1/DER INTEGER components have two rules that RSAParameters does not like.

All leading 0x00 values are removed.
If the leading byte has the high bit set (>=0x80) but the number was supposed to be positive, insert a 0x00.

.NET wants the values as big-endian byte arrays (which is the same byte order as the DER encoding) with the following relationship:

Exponent is as big as it needs to be, so long as it doesn't start with 0x00.
Modulus is as big as it needs to be, so long as it doesn't start with 0x00.
D must be the same size as modulus (insert 0x00 as necessary)
P must be ""half-round-up"" the size of Modulus ((Modulus.Length + 1) / 2), insert 0x00 as necessary.
Q, DP, DQ, and InverseQ must have the same length as P.  (Insert 0x00 as necessary).

.NET Core 3.0+ PKCS#1 RSAPrivateKey
The ImportRSAPrivateKey method is declared on RSA, and since it parses data and calls ImportParameters it works for all RSA derived types (assuming they already supported parameter import).
using (RSA rsa = RSA.Create())
{
    rsa.ImportRSAPrivateKey(blob, out _);
    return rsa.SignData(data, HashAlgorithmName.SHA256, RSASignaturePadding.Pkcs1);
}

Some other format
Determine what RFC defines the ASN.1 structure for your key format, then keep that in mind and evaluate the RSAPrivateKey section.
DSAParameters and ECParameters each have their own spatial expectations.

","SHA256 isn't an encryption algorithm, it's a hash algorithm. In other words, it's a one way function whose job is to take an input of any length and produce an output of fixed length with low collisions that's always the same for the same input. Thus, it doesn't receive a key as an input because the nature of hashing is quite different from that of encryption.
If you want to encrypt something with a key and later decrypt it by having the same key, look into symmetric encryption like AES (e.g. using the AesManaged class).

Also, as Theodoros mentioned, SHA256 is a hash, not encryption. A hash is a cryptographic checksum that is used to validate or compare data. It can not be reversed into the original plaintext, which is a requirement of encryption.

How can i realize that in C#? As far as I see the SHA256-Class does not contain a property for key in C#.

Either you or the person who gave you the assignment doesn't understand what is being asked.
SHA256 doesn't have a key or a value, it only has data going in and a hash coming out. No matter how much data you run through it, the size of the hash does not change, although it's value does. You can think of a hash as a fingerprint for a particular dataset.

In C# you are using 000102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F
private static byte[] ivBytes = new byte[] { 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04,

Since you're having both perform the encryption and you're comparing the encrypted results, this will have a massive effect on the output.  (If one was decrypting and the other encrypting the errors would be limited to the first 16 bytes).
I also feel compelled to point out that SHA-2-256 is a terrible key derivation function.  If you're trying to turn a password into a key you should use a real KDF, like PBKDF2 (password-based key derivation function (version) 2).  In .NET it's implemented as Rfc2898DeriveBytes.  In Java it seems to be the ""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1"" SecretKeyFactory.

"984680","Difference in SHA hashes between ruby and C#","I'm developing an application, that makes use of some REST web services.
It's technical documentation says that I should pass SHA256 hash of some string in the request.
In an example request (in the documentation) a string:

hn-Rw2ZHYwllUYkklL5Zo_7lWJVkrbShZPb5CD1expires=1893013926label[0]=any/somestatistics=1d,2d,7d,28d,30d,31d,lifetimestatus=upl,livetitle=a

After executing:
digest = Digest::SHA256.digest(string_to_sign)
signature = Base64::encode64(digest).chomp.gsub(/=+$/, '')

results in a hash:

YRYuN2zO+VvxISNp/vKQM5Cl6Dpzoin7mNES0IZJ06U

This example is in ruby, as the documentation is for ruby developers.
I'm developing my application in C# and for the exactly same string, when I execute:
byte[] rawHash = sha256.ComputeHash(rawRequest, 0, rawRequest.Length);
string friendlyHash = Convert.ToBase64String(rawHash);

and remove the trailing ""="" signs, I get:

Vw8pl/KxnjcEbyHtfNiMikXZdIunysFF2Ujsow8hyiw

and therefore, the application fails to execute resulting in an signature mismatch error.
I've tried changing the encoding while converting the string to a byte array preceding the hashing and nothing changed.
Any ideas?

","To encrypt with SHA-256 you don't use the encrypt() function but rather the hash() function (SHA is a one-way hash):
<cfset EncryptedPassword = Hash(form.password, ""SHA-256"") />

I believe CF will return an all-uppercase hash so make sure you compare to the uppercase of the password encrypted in the database:
AND UPPER(password) = <cfqueryparam cfsqltype=""CF_SQL_VARCHAR"" value=""#EncryptedPassword#"" />

Also watch for encoding! It's possible that the data in the database could have a different encoding than the default (e.g., iso-8859-1 rather than utf-8).
Hope this helps.

"42367566","Java deprecation of SHA-1 signatures: correct way to sign with SHA-256?","In light of Java's deprecation of SHA-1 signed code, I am transitioning to SHA-256. However, I am not sure whether, in order to comply with the new requirements, I should explicitly request the -digestalg SHA-256 (if not, it sefaults to SHA-1, as per this). (Side-note: although the public-private key pair in my JKS are RSA, I found I also had to explicitly ask -sigalg SHA256withRSA.)
Java 9 ""early access"" seems to accept just fine the SHA1 digest algorithm, as long as the signature algorithm is SHA256withRSA. I searched for a clear explanation of these exact terms (in the context...as reported by a jarsigner verification: ""Digest algorithm"", ""Signature algorithm"") / their implications, without too much success, though.
The JREs I am targeting are 6 or better. Using Java 6 on the build machine as well.
[L.E.] More confusingly for me, it seems that the jarsigner (in Java 9) verifies the jars (read: no complaints raised) even when both the digest algorithm and the signature algorithm are SHA-1, just on account that I have used an SHA256 certificate.
[L.E. 2] Interestingly, signing on Java 9 w/o providing any of the custom flags, and using the same JKS, everything is signed as expected:
Digest algorithm: SHA-256
 Signature algorithm: SHA256withRSA, 2048-bit key
I very much think this behavior underlines the ""proper practice"", rather than Java 6's. This may very well become the answer to this question...once Java 9 will be release. 
As another side-note, the Java Crypto Roadmap announces the same plan (Disable SHA-1 in certificate chains anchored by roots included by default in Oracle's JDK; local or enterprise CAs are not affected. Signed code that is timestamped before 2017-01-01 is not affected.) for Java 6, 7, 8 as well.

=========================================
 from Bitcoin Wiki
Transaction puzzle
Transaction '...' is an interesting puzzle.

To spend the transaction you need to come up with some data such that hashing the data twice results in the given hash. The required data happened to be the Genesis block, and the given hash was the genesis block hash
==========================================
genesis = '000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f'
The following function doublehashes input(it works for step 14 in this example)
def function(input):
    data = input.decode('hex_codec')
    result = binascii.hexlify(hashlib.sha256(hashlib.sha256(data).digest()).digest())
    print result

But inputting the genesis hash, it produces the following result:

I'm obviously doing something wrong but can't seem to figure out what. 

ANSWER: As mentioned by Falsaltru;
The required hash was used earlier to calculate the blockhash, thus why the hash itself was 'not hard to find'.

"45031419","How to sign XML with SHA256 & X.509 correctly?","I want to sign a XML with SHA256 by using a self-signed X.509 certificate. I was inspired by many articles in Stackoverflow and use this code:
X509Certificate2 cert = new X509Certificate2();
X509Store store = new X509Store(StoreName.Root, StoreLocation.LocalMachine);
store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);
foreach (X509Certificate2 cert2 in store.Certificates)
{
    if (cert2.Subject == ""CN=TestCerificate"")
    {
        cert = cert2;
        break;
    }
}

store.Close();

CryptoConfig.AddAlgorithm(typeof(RSAPKCS1SHA256SignatureDescription), ""http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256"");
var exportedKeyMaterial = cert.PrivateKey.ToXmlString(true);
var key = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(new CspParameters(24));
key.PersistKeyInCsp = false;
key.FromXmlString(exportedKeyMaterial);

XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument();
doc.PreserveWhitespace = true;
doc.Load(""test.xml"");

SignedXml signedXml = new SignedXml(doc);
signedXml.SigningKey = key;
signedXml.SignedInfo.SignatureMethod = ""http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256"";

Reference reference = new Reference();
reference.AddTransform(new XmlDsigEnvelopedSignatureTransform());
reference.AddTransform(new XmlDsigExcC14NTransform());
reference.Uri = """";
reference.DigestMethod = ""http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256""; 
signedXml.AddReference(reference);

KeyInfo keyInfo = new KeyInfo();
keyInfo.AddClause(new KeyInfoX509Data(cert));
signedXml.KeyInfo = keyInfo;
signedXml.ComputeSignature();

doc.Save(""testSig.xml"");

Afterwards, the generated signed XML part of ""testSig.xml"" looks like this:
<Signature xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#"">
    <SignedInfo>
      <CanonicalizationMethod Algorithm=""http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315"" />
      <SignatureMethod Algorithm=""http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#dsa-sha1"" />
      <Reference URI="""">
        <Transforms>
          <Transform Algorithm=""http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#enveloped-signature"" />

    </SignedInfo>
    <SignatureValue>HANI0GrICbyc5tlmvtU9cB7txdxtuY4uDsntp5XVzaRQbts76ff3Qg==</SignatureValue>
  </Signature>

As you can see the XML says that ""SHA1"" was used to sign the XML instead (see nodes ""SignatureMethod"" & ""DigestMethod""). But I would expect, that the SHA256-URLs have to be stated in these nodes. Is this assumption correct? If yes, does anybody know how to solve this problem? I use C# 4.6.0.
With best regards,
Michael
","While you successfully called signedXml.ComputeSignature() that just does the computation, it doesn't insert a signature element into the document (the XmlDocument you pass in the constructor is just what document GetXml()'s node will parent to).
You need to call signedXml.GetXml() (after ComputeSignature) to get the computed ds:Signature element, then insert that into your document.
The fact that your document has a signature node already in it is confusing.  My first thought was that test.xml already had that signature in it, but your comment says that it was just some oops code from elsewhere. Lesson learned, I guess :).

Sorry for the long code. Also, don't mind the unnecessary includes, i just wasn't sure which were needed so i compiled regardless.
This is written in C(obviously) running under Linux, Ubuntu 11.04.
This program takes as an argument some string and must compute it's sha256 hash(twice, while doing various stuff before actually hashing it).
Although the program compiles,runs and takes the string, it spews some weird characters instead of a hash.
Why so?
P.S
This code is not mine, i just made it into a separate program for myself, but like i said, printing the hash fails with some weird characters!
P.S2
SHA256 is defined in the LibSSL's libcrypto library. The program is compiled with the -lcrypto argument using gcc.
","The output of a hash is almost always opaque binary data - i.e. any bytes.
You're trying to print those as if they were text. That means it'll be applying some encoding to the binary data, trying to interpret it as text.
Basically you should use the opposite of hex2bin in order to convert the arbitrary binary data into hex.

From dropbox's documentation, they write:
""Every notification request will include a header called X-Dropbox-Signature that includes an HMAC-SHA256 signature of the request body, using your app secret as the signing key. This lets your app verify that the notification really came from Dropbox.""
So I successfully catch that signature, and I use NodeJS built in crypto module to try to create my own signature with HMAC SHA256 and then compare my signature against the signature Dropbox sends me.
Here is my code for doing so:
  var sign = req.get(""X-Dropbox-Signature"");
  console.log(sign);
  var hmac = crypto.createHmac(algorithm, secret);
  hmac.update(JSON.stringify(req.body));
  hash = hmac.digest('hex');
  console.log(hash);

Where algorithm is just 'sha256'
and secret is my secret key that I got from my dropbox apps page.
I have to use JSON.stringify(req.body) because req.body is an object and hmac.update takes a string. I am wondering if that is where my error comes from?
I console log the sign which is the signature from dropbox, and then I console log the signature which I created using hmac, but it is a different signature.
Any suggestions to what I may be doing wrong?
","Greg is right. You need to use the raw body request to check the ingredients of the message. The following code employs the body-parser library to extract the raw body.
var bodyParser = require(""body-parser"");

app.use(bodyParser.json({verify:function(req,res,buf){req.rawBody=buf}}))

Then for the post method:
app.post('/webhooks', function(req, res) {

    const retrievedSignature = req.get(""X-header-Integrity"")
    //send this body string for validation with secret

    //ExternalSignature es = new PrivateKeySignature(pk, ""SHA-256"", ""SUN"");

    ExternalDigest digest = new ProviderDigest(""SUN"");
    MakeSignature.signDetached(appearance, digest, es, chain, null, null, null, 0, CryptoStandard.CMS);

As you can see, I am just copying the samples and changed the provider name and the call 'new BouncyCastleDigest()' to 'new ProviderDigest(""SUN"")'
Peeking at the source codes of iText (5.5.1-SNAPSHOT), I find the followings code fragments suspicious:

MakeSignature.java line 142 - 145
hashAlgorithm = externalSignature.getHashAlgorithm() is called and then used in
DigestAlgorithms.digest(data, externalDigest.getMessageDigest(hashAlgorithm));
PrivateKeySignature.java line 76
Since I am using PrivateKeySignature, I peek at PrivateKeySignature.java and find that it returns its private class member hashAlgorithm and this is how it obtains the value during Construction (line 76):
this.hashAlgorithm = 
DigestAlgorithms.getDigest(DigestAlgorithms.getAllowedDigests(hashAlgorithm));
DigestAlgorithms.java methods  getAllowedDigests() and getDigest()
In turn, getAllowedDigests() returns the OID of the algorithm if the algorithm name is found in the allowedDigests hash map (2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1 in my case), otherwise it returns null. 
getDigest gets the digest name back from the OID using the digestNames hash map.
However, the name in digestNames hash map that corresponds to the OID is SHA256, not SHA-256.

As a result, the final digest name got was ""SHA256"" as opposed to ""SHA-256"" and ""SHA256"" was causing the NoSuchAlgorithm exception in SUN provider.
(I tried getting a message digest instance directly using the SUN provider. It succeeded for SHA-256 but threw the same exception I am reporting here for SHA256.
Is this a problem with iText when using JCE providers other than BC? 
Appreciate if anyone could shed some light on my problem.
","As a temporary workaround, I added the followings to PrivateKeySignature.java:
// Temporary fix - to remove hyphenation in hashAlgorithm name
//        String signMode = hashAlgorithm + ""with"" + encryptionAlgorithm;
        String signMode = hashAlgorithm.replaceAll(""-"","""") + ""with"" + encryptionAlgorithm;
// End Temporary fix
It works for me at least for now. Has to investigate how standard names of different algorithms in different context go before a long term solution can be devised, I believe.

For example 'Moien' should always be represeted with ""e9cad067-56f3-3ea9-98d2-26e25778c48f"", not any changes like project rebuild should be able to change that UUID.
The reason why I'm doing this is so that I don't want those specific texts to be readable(understandable) to human. 
Note: I don't need the ability to regenerate the main text (e.g ""Moien"") after hashing .
I have an alternative way too :

            byte[] hash = digest.digest((matcher.group(1)).getBytes(""UTF-8""));

","UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes appears to basically just be MD5 hashing, with the result being represented as a UUID.
It feels clearer to me to use a base64-encoded hash explicitly, partly as you can then control which hash gets used - which could be relevant if collisions pose any sort of security risk. (SHA-256 is likely a better option than MD5 for exactly that reason.) The string will be longer from SHA-256 of course, but hopefully that's not a problem.
Note that in either case, I'd convert the string to text using a fixed encoding via StandardCharsets. Don't use the platform default (as per your first snippet) and prefer StandardCharsets over magic string values (as per your second snippet).

","Its shame I was not able to find openssl command to extract hash directly from the cert. So you have to create the public key first in order to get the public key hash. There are two ways to extract the public key.

openssl ec -in ecc_private_key.key -pubout -out ec_public_key.pem

OR  
B. From the cert downloaded from apple pay portal (after uploading payment processing csr)
openssl x509 -inform der -in apple_pay.cer -pubkey -noout > apple_pay_public_key.pem

Both will give you public key in following format

You can use following code to extract the base64 hash from above public key remember to remove headers/footers and line feeds. 
I hoped I could have figured out how to use openssl tool to get hash from public key but anyway following c# code works for me. its very simple and easy to port to java/python/php or whatever your preference is. Or just use following code online at ideone.com

SHA256 sha256 = SHA256Managed.Create();
byte[] hash = sha256.ComputeHash(publicKey);
String publicKeyHash = Convert.ToBase64String(hash);

Console.WriteLine(""Result: {0}"", publicKeyHash);

Please keep in mind that your system should be able to accept multiple keys at any given time and instead of just verifying you need to load the correct private key based on publicKeyHash you receive from device(iphone/ipad etc) considering the scenario when your current certificate is expiring (or you are revoking for any reason) otherwise your system may not be able to accept the transaction for a short period of time.

Based on the comment that the hash value must, when encoded to ASCII, fit within 16 ASCI characters, the solution is first, to choose some cryptographic hash function (the SHA-2 family includes SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512) 
  then, to truncate the output of the chosen hash function to 96 bits (12 bytes) - that is, keep the first 12 bytes of the hash function output and discard the remaining bytes 
  then, to base-64-encode the truncated output to 16 ASCII characters (128 bits) 
  yielding effectively a 96-bit-strong cryptographic hash. 

If I substring the base-64-encoded string to 16 characters is that fundamentally different then keeping the first 12 bytes of the hash function and then base-64-encoding them? If so, could someone please explain (provide example code) for truncating the byte array?
I tested the substring of the full hash value against 36,000+ distinct values and had no collisions. The code below  is my current implementation.
Thanks for any help (and clarity) you can provide.
public static byte[] CreateSha256Hash(string data)
{
    byte[] dataToHash = (new UnicodeEncoding()).GetBytes(data);
    SHA256 shaM = new SHA256Managed();
    byte[] hashedData = shaM.ComputeHash(dataToHash);

    return hashedData;
}

public override void InputBuffer_ProcessInputRow(InputBufferBuffer Row)
{
    byte[] hashedData = CreateSha256Hash(Row.HashString);

    string s = Convert.ToBase64String(hashedData, Base64FormattingOptions.None);

    Row.HashValue = s.Substring(0, 16);


}

[Original post]
(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4340471/is-there-a-hash-algorithm-that-produces-a-hash-size-of-64-bits-in-c)
","No, there is no difference. However, it's easier to just get the base64 string of the first 12 bytes of the array, instead of truncating the array:
public override void InputBuffer_ProcessInputRow(InputBufferBuffer Row) {

    byte[] hashedData = CreateSha256Hash(Row.HashString);

    Row.HashValue = Convert.ToBase64String(hashedData, 0, 12);

}

The base 64 encoding simply puts 6 bits in each character, so 3 bytes (24 bits) goes into 4 characters. As long as you are splitting the data at an even 3 byte boundary, it's the same as splitting the string at the even 4 character boundary.
If you try to split the data between these boundaries, the base64 string will be padded with filler data up to the next boundary, so the result would not be the same.

"4494402","Truncating a byte array vs. substringing the Encoded string coming out of SHA-256","I am not familiar with Hashing algorithms and the risks associated when using them and therefore have a question on the answer below that I received on a previous question . . .  

Based on the comment that the hash value must, when encoded to ASCII, fit within 16 ASCI characters, the solution is first, to choose some cryptographic hash function (the SHA-2 family includes SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512) 
  then, to truncate the output of the chosen hash function to 96 bits (12 bytes) - that is, keep the first 12 bytes of the hash function output and discard the remaining bytes 
  then, to base-64-encode the truncated output to 16 ASCII characters (128 bits) 
  yielding effectively a 96-bit-strong cryptographic hash. 

If I substring the base-64-encoded string to 16 characters is that fundamentally different then keeping the first 12 bytes of the hash function and then base-64-encoding them? If so, could someone please explain (provide example code) for truncating the byte array?
I tested the substring of the full hash value against 36,000+ distinct values and had no collisions. The code below  is my current implementation.
Thanks for any help (and clarity) you can provide.
public static byte[] CreateSha256Hash(string data)
{
    byte[] dataToHash = (new UnicodeEncoding()).GetBytes(data);
    SHA256 shaM = new SHA256Managed();
    byte[] hashedData = shaM.ComputeHash(dataToHash);

    return hashedData;
}

public override void InputBuffer_ProcessInputRow(InputBufferBuffer Row)
{
    byte[] hashedData = CreateSha256Hash(Row.HashString);

    string s = Convert.ToBase64String(hashedData, Base64FormattingOptions.None);

    Row.HashValue = s.Substring(0, 16);

"26784060","How to use PHP crypt() function with a SHA256 salt string to generate the same hash it would generate if SHA256 wasn't supported on the server?","My web application uses the PHP crypt() function for password hashing. I wanted to use SHA256 algorithm, so I generated the users' salt strings accordingly. The problem is that i didn't realize that SHA256 was not supported on the server I was using (CRYPT_SHA_256). I've just moved my application to another server which supports SHA256 and basically none of my users can log in because their password strings and salt strings generate different hashes compared to the hashes generated on the previous server.
What do you think the best solution would be without asking every single user to change their passwords?
Thank you in advance, I appreciate any useful ideas.
","Actually the crypt() function should be able to verify your existing hashes, even if they are not SHA-256 as you wanted to generate. Since the new password API internally use the crypt() function, it should even be possible to verify your hashes with the new functions:
// Check if the hash of the entered login password, matches the stored hash.
// The salt and the cost factor will be extracted from $existingHashFromDb.
$isPasswordCorrect = password_verify($password, $existingHashFromDb);

To generate new hashes you should use the new function password_hash(), it will automatically create a safe salt. Evenmore it calculates a BCrypt hash, instead of the SHA-256 which is not appropriate to hash passwords.
// Hash a new password for storing in the database.
// The function automatically generates a cryptographically safe salt.
$hashToStoreInDb = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);

I used this resource to do some research on implementation but it only shows Java code, how do I do this in MySQL? Would this be done in a stored procedure?
Thanks
","I am no authority on the security aspects but using SQL Server you could handle the different pieces in the following manner:

For Hashing:

You could use [HASHBYTES] and either of the SHA-2 algorithms based on your requirement. HASHBYTES('SHA2_256', @Password);
Be aware that this function takes only 8000 bytes and works on varchar, nvarchar, or varbinary, which should suffice in your case but just in case. 
You could also write a SQL CLR function in .NET to do the hashing if the input constraints dont work for you.

For the Salt:

Use GUIDs , using a part of the GUID might not give you the entropy required for a salt, so I recommend using the whole string.
or Use the RANDOM() function to generate a unique alphanumeric string with bit of logic. 

Process:

Add the Salt to the Password before hashing (HASHBYTES('SHA2_256', @Password + Salt);and store both the Hashed output and Salt for the user during the registration process.
On a subsequent login attempt, Add the user-entered password with the salt and get Hashed output and then compare it with the store hashed value. If the value matches then the user is legitimate else not.

I need to compute hash values on a large file where the hash is done block by block. The thing that I am stumped on at the moment is how to break up the file into these blocks? I'm using python, which I'm very new to.

(note: as you might notice, this code doesn't really produce anything at the moment - I'm just getting some of the scaffolding set up)
","You'll have to do a few things to make this example work correctly. Here are some points:

Crypto.Hash.SHA256.SHA256Hash.update() (you invoke it as m.update()) has no return value. To pull a human-readable hash out of the object, .update() it a bunch of times and then call .hexdigest()
You don't need to encode binary data before feeding it to the .update() function. Just pass the string containing the data block.
File pointers are advanced by file.read(). You don't need a separate .seek() operation.
.read() will return an empty string if you've hit EOF already. This is totally fine. Feel free just to pull in that partial block.
Variable names are case-sensitive. block_size is not the same variable as BLOCK_SIZE.

Making these few minor adjustments, and assuming you have all the right imports, you'll be on the right track.

","Alternative solution would be breaking the file into blocks first and then perform hash block by block
This will break the file into chunks of 1024 bytes
with open(file,'rb') as f:
    while True:
        chunk = f.read(1024)
        if chunk:
            fList.append(chunk)
        else:
            numBlocks = len(fList)
            break

Note: last block size may be less than 1024 bytes
Now you can do the hash in whichever you want to.

These files however may change and I would like to add a way to check the hash value of the local file against a provided value (within CMake) to decide if the file needs to be re-downloaded.
Currently, once the file has been downloaded, CMake will not consider re-downloading it, because the file already exists locally.
In the future, I want to provide a MD5 / SHA256 checksum of that file and make sure the local file is the corect one.

I get a sha256 from an API to compare the values. This is the method I use to get the SHA256 hash:
private string getSha256(string data) {
            byte[] byteData = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data);
            var hasher = WinRTCrypto.HashAlgorithmProvider.OpenAlgorithm(HashAlgorithm.Sha256);
            byte[] hash = hasher.HashData(byteData);
            string hashBase64 = Convert.ToBase64String(hash);
            return hashBase64;
        }

The string I use is 'secret'. I use this to check it:
http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator
and it gives:
2bb80d537b1da3e38bd30361aa855686bde0eacd7162fef6a25fe97bf527a25b

API hash:

PCLCrypto hash I generated:
    K7gNU3sdo+OL0wNhqoVWhr3g6s1xYv72ol/pe/Unols=
Its the same string 'secret' but is resulting in different hashes. I also noticed PCLCrypto hash always ends with '='. 
Why are they different?
","If you use a converter like http://hash.online-convert.com/sha256-generator you'll see that the two hashes are the same (enter 'secret' in the Text box and click on Convert File).
The '2bb80...' string is the hex encoding of the hash, and the 'K7gNU...' string is the base64 encoding of the hash (which is what you asked for in your call to PCLCrypto).  The issue is that the hash itself is binary data, so to display it you need some conversion to string. You're seeing two common ways to do that, both using the same underlying hash.

Video gallery on a website, represented by thumbnails. They are in random order.
They play in the lightbox. They don't have a unique ID, only their URL is unique.

The suffix needs to be short and simple, definitely not a URL.
People share the URL.
The server can make sense of the lightbox/ba7816bf8f01 in relation to /video-gallery.
Visiting the URL, the lightbox needs to find which video the suffix belongs to and play it.

I thought I'd SHA256 the URL of the video, use the first few characters as an ad-hoc ID. How many characters should I use from the generated hash, to considerably reduce the chance of collision?

","The CF documentation for hmac is sorely lacking useful details. The reason your code does not work is that hmac() returns a hexadecimal string. Whereas the PHP call to hash-hmac returns binary. As a result, your CF script is base64 encoding a completely different value. That is why the two results do not match. 
You need to decode the hex string into binary first. Then encode the binary as base64 and the results will match:
resultAsHex = hmac(""Well done is better than well said."", ""key"", ""HmacSHA256"");
finalValue = binaryEncode( binaryDecode(resultAsHex, ""hex""), ""base64"" );
writeDump( finalValue );

","Any hash that satisfies the strict avalanche criterion (that is, if any bit is flipped in the input, every bit in the output will be flipped with a probability of 50%) may be used in this way, and that includes every cryptographic hash in common use, including SHA512. There are security implications to using very short hashes, but if they really aren't relevant, as you claim, you're free to select the fastest hash available (probably MD5).
Since short hashes will be particularly vulnerable to the birthday paradox, though, consider using longer hashes anyway. If you're generating so many hashes that 16 bits versus 256 bits is significant, you will run into duplicates even without malicious attackers.

I tried using the DSACryptoServiceProvider, but it only supports SHA1 or MD5. 
But it seems that ECDsaCng is able to support ECDSA-with-SHA256. The only problem that I have is that I don't know how to convert the Private and Public Key from my X509Certificate2 into the necessary CngKey. I read another question where someone described how to convert the Public Key. But in order to be able to sign data, I need the Private Key, too. 
So is there a way to get the CngKey of the Private and Public Key out of the X509Certificate2? The certificates are available in different formats. I have them as PFX file and separately as CER and PEM files. 
I would prefer to stick with the .NET Framework 4, but if it's not possible at all to use it, I would also switch to Bouncy Castle.

A probably better and more solid alternative to dual-signing is an installer that includes both sha1- and sha2-signed binaries which installs the correct set depending on the os version. Since the major parts of the binaries are identical the compressed installer size also won't increase too much.

This is because when I do not perform the binascii.unhexlify on the Hex-String inputs in Python, I render identical results for both methods. However, the Python HMAC-SHA256 requires the binascii.unhexlify operation. 
I have done a lot of research and even attempted to import the method that Python uses to perform the binascii.unhexlify in Java but I am still unable to produce identical results. Any help and/or advise would be more than appreciated in solving this issue. Can anybody help me out?

","Got the same problem.
Actually, after JSON encoding I have had to clean the blank spaces between key/value pairs up.
But I am getting different signatures for the ciphertext. That causes that final signature is different from the examples.
Notice that in example code they do a trailing pad for order number in the 3DES encryption.
iv = b'\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0'
k = DES3.new(key, DES3.MODE_CBC, iv)
ceros = b'\0'*(len(DS_MERCHANT_ORDER)%8)
clave = k.encrypt(DS_MERCHANT_ORDER+ceros.encode('UTF-8'))

Thanks 
EDITED:
Finally I fixed it:
To get the specific per operation key:
    iv = b'\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0'
    k = DES3.new(key, DES3.MODE_CBC, iv)
    ceros = b'\0'*(len(DS_MERCHANT_ORDER)%8)
    claveOp = k.encrypt(DS_MERCHANT_ORDER+ceros.encode('UTF-8'))

To get the hmac.sha256:
    from Crypto.Hash import HMAC, SHA256
    # Realizo la codificacion SHA256
    dig = HMAC.new(claveOp , msg=DS_MERCHANT_PARAMETERS,    digestmod=SHA256).digest()
    signatureEnc = base64.b64encode(dig)

You can just pass the user-provided password, or even an already hashed password as it will detect if already hashed or not. Of course this presumes that passwords starting with a #hash character are not allowed (and would be caught before).

","To hash passowrds, i'm currently using a function similar to:
function hashPassword($str, $salt='786df') {
    hash('sha512', $salt.$str.'7');
}

This is a SH512 with a dynamic salt (per site) and a fixed salt (to have a salt if $salt is empty that is a php constant in fact). This solution is ultra secure, I understand it made hashes that are very hard to decrypt.
Like you did, you can use SHA256 by this way and then use base64_encode() (probably useless).

","Your $string_to_sign variable is missing a '?' between start and SignatureMethod for your encoded Signature.

Signature version 2 is an enhanced signing method for both Amazon
  Simple Pay and Amazon Flexible Payments Service.
For inbound requests (from your application to Amazon Payments), it
  uses the entire request URI as the basis for the signature, with
  encryption based on the unique security credentials for your account.
For outbound requests (from Amazon Payments to your application),
  Amazon signs the response which you can verify using the
  VerifySignature API

EDIT:
As @Jonathan Spooner mentioned already and what I use is the function varifySignature() located in 

/amazon-fps-2010-08-28-php5-library/src/Amazon/FPS/Samples/Client.php

which can be downloaded here. It also has an example as to how to use it in 

/amazon-fps-2010-08-28-php5-library/src/Amazon/FPS/Samples/VerifySignatureSample.php

It makes the whole process much easier. It may be worth a shot...

","The only piece that wasn't suggested was that you need to use rawurlencode() on the transactionAmount that's part of the $string_to_sign.
Most other answers are a piece of the problem. For instance, you need to add a new line to the $string_to_sign after the GET (which you have), after the authorize.payments-sandbox.amazon.com, and after the /cobranded-ui/actions/start. You also need to set the $raw_output parameter to true in the hash_hmac() function.
I've included a complete working rewrite of your code (replace <Your_Access_Key> and <Your_Secret_Key>):
$return_url = rawurlencode('http://problemio.com');
$payment_reason = 'donation';
$transaction_amount = rawurlencode('4.0');

$secret_key = '<Your_Secret_Key>';
$my_access_key_id = '<Your_Access_Key>';

$string_to_sign = 'GET
authorize.payments-sandbox.amazon.com
/cobranded-ui/actions/start

However, I strongly suggest that you use the PHP library provided by the FPS community which can be downloaded here. I use this in production code and have never had an issue. Using the FPS library, your code would look like the following:
<?php

require_once 'CBUISingleUsePipeline.php';
require_once 'CBUIPipeline.php';

$secret_key = '<Your_Secret_Key>';
$my_access_key_id = '<Your_Access_Key>';

$return_url = 'http://problemio.com';
$transaction_amount = '4.0';
$caller_reference = '<Your_Caller_Reference>';
$payment_reason = 'donation';

$base = 'https://authorize.payments-sandbox.amazon.com/cobranded-ui/actions/start';

$pipeline = new Amazon_FPS_CBUISingleUsePipeline($my_access_key_id, $secret_key);
$pipeline->setMandatoryParameters($caller_reference, $return_url, $transaction_amount);
$pipeline->addParameter('paymentReason', $payment_reason);
$uRL = $pipeline->getURL($base);

You could have figured this out by comparing the documentation you linked (which shows they require hex strings) with your original hashedsig and the functions it provides.
Secondly, as a  commenter pointed out, you need to apply HMAC, not just SHA256:
params = urlencode({

I now know after hunting around for a number of hours that in .NET 4 the algorithm used is HMACSHA256. I understand that i need a key for the algorithm to work correctly.
My question is how do it do this?
Do i put the key in the config file and reference it in some way?
Any help would be appreciated!
Thanks.   
","Don't use SHA!. Go and download BCrypt.Net. SHA is too fast at hashing which makes anything encrypted with it easy to brute force. BCrypt is slower due to a configurable work factor, so whilst imperceptable to the user, when trying to brute force 700m keys a second, you simply can't.
Once you have bcrypt all you need to do to hash is:
private static readonly int BCRYPT_WORK_FACTOR = 10;
string hashedPassword = BCrypt.Net.BCrypt.HashPassword(account.HashedPassword, BCRYPT_WORK_FACTOR);

and to check a password:
bool matched = BCrypt.Net.BCrypt.Verify(password, match.HashedPassword))

","I think you are describing the approach used by SuperGenPass:
Take a master password (same for every site), concatenate it with the site's domain name, and then hash the thing.
Yes, SHA-256 would be secure for that, likely more secure than when SuperGenPass uses. However, you will end up with very long passwords, too long for many sites to accept, and also not guaranteed to contain numbers and letters and special characters at the same time, which some sites require.
Also, the general problem remains that if somehow (not by breaking the algorithm, but by other means) your master password does get leaked, all your passwords are belong to us.
Completely random passwords are most secure (if we ignore the problem of storing them securely somewhere).

","As far as I understand, you have or want two copies of the same PE executable file. Now you want to change either or both of these files, so that when you calculate a hash of the file's contents, they are different.
If you change the checksum, chances are the executable won't run anymore. If you're OK with that, you can easily use the class that you showed. It seems to assume a checksum consists of two bytes and is offset at byte 0x12 in the executable. I can't verify right now that it is correct, but at a glance it doesn't seem to be.
Anyway you can create your unique checksum per file and set it:
FileUtils.WriteCheckSum(sourceFile, destFile1, 1);
FileUtils.WriteCheckSum(sourceFile, destFile2, 2);

Now the two files will bear different contents, so the hash of their contents will be different.

I have couple of questions
1) I want to calculate RSA-SHA256 of a file, so I calculate sha256 hash of the entire file first and pass this hash as an input to signing function.
Is that a correct approach?
2) If yes, what might have gone wrong in the code above ? If no, what would be the correct approach ?
node.js version I am using is 0.10.36 and openssl version is 1.0,1.
","The problem is that your Openssl command just sign your data without hash function.
You must first hash your data with openssl and with the same function as in your nodejs code (SHA-256) then sign the hash to obtain the final signature with your command: 
openssl rsautl -sign -in /tmp/data -inkey /tmp/boot2-prvKey.pem -out sig
You can see that in this command your havent specify any hash function.
To obtain a signature:  data -> SHA-256 = hash -> RSA =  signature
I havent enough time to test it and give you the right code, i hope it will be helpfull.

","When you supply an input to a signature program, it might assume that the input is not yet hashed, and will hash it before signing. The problem here is that Node is (re-)hashing the input, while rsautl is using the input as-is. (Note that even if you separately re-hash the input before supplying it to rsautl, it's still won't match because rsautl does not use ASN1 encoding; see below.)
To make OpenSSL produce a SHA256 hash before making an RSA signature (like Node does), you need to use the dgst command with the -sha256 and -sign arguments:
openssl dgst -sha256 -sign /tmp/boot2-prvKey.pem -hex < /tmp/data

This will hash /tmp/data and sign the hash with RSA, which is exactly what Node's RSA-SHA256 signer does.
See Difference between openSSL rsautl and dgst for more information:

The simple answer is that dgst -sign creates a hash, ASN1 encodes it, and then signs the ASN1 encoded hash, whereas rsautl -sign just signs the input without hashing or ASN1 encoding.

The behavior of Node's sign method is like dgst -sign rather than rsautl -sign.
Node does not appear to offer a built-in rsautl-like mechanism for signing without hashing and ASN1-encoding. For this reason, you may need to sign the document directly, rather than operate on a hash of the document. If you really can't do that for some reason, you can download the Node rsautl module from NPM, which provides Node bindings for rsautl.

hashlib.sha256('0110100001100101011011000110110001101111’.decode('hex')).hexdigest()

I believe it interprets the string as hex based on substituting the hex value (‘68656c6c6f’) into the above and it returning 

2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824

And comparing to this answer in which ‘hello’ or ‘68656c6c6f’ is used.  
I think the answer lies with the decode component but I can’t find an example for binary only ‘hex’ or ‘utf-8’ 
Is anyone able to suggest what needs to be changed so that the function interprets as binary values instead of hex? 
","Here is code that does each of the data conversions you are looking for.  These steps can all be combined, but are separated here so you can see each value.

","The error:0906D06C:PEM routines:PEM_read_bio:no start line is non-fatal.  That means it didn't find a certificate along with the private key which is okay since there is only a public/private key in this case.
openssl_verify() returns -1 on failure, 1 if the signature is correct and 0 if it is incorrect.  Because of this you should be checking for all 3 values, not just true or false.
You should check the return value of openssl_verify for -1 indicating failure.  If it returns 0, then the key is valid but either the signature is invalid, the data was tampered with, or the wrong public key was used for verification.

Anyway the solution is bit more complex.
You have to use BouncyCastle (https://www.bouncycastle.org/) library.
But not the version avaiable, but a version that was modified by on user on another forum.
The link to the bouncy castle library modified is:
http://www.mediafire.com/download/uc63d1hepqyuhee/bccrypto-net-1.7-src-ext_with_CADES-BES.zip
You have to use crypto.dll library found in bin\release and reference it in your project.

","The error and symptom seem to indicate that the CSP (Cryptographic Service Provider) which is doing the signing operation doesn't support SHA-2.  If it's working in BouncyCastle then they are seemingly exporting the private key and re-importing it into their software provider.
In .NET 4.7.2 you could try the following:
...
try
{
    // Viene calcolata la firma del file (in formato PKCS7)
    signedCms.ComputeSignature(signer,false);
}
catch (CryptographicException CEx)
{

        using (RSA tmpRsa = RSA.Create())
        {
            tmpRsa.ImportParameters(cert.GetRSAPrivateKey().ExportParameters(true));

            using (X509Certificate2 tmpCertNoKey = new X509Certificate2(cert.RawData))

If the certificate is actually being loaded from a PFX file on the USB device, then the problem is that the PFX specifies to use an older software CSP which predated SHA-2.  Getting the PFX regenerated to use the newest RSA CSP would also solve the problem.

openssl dgst -sha256 -hex -sign ./id_rsa my.data > my.signature
The openssl docs note that:

Hex signatures cannot be verified using openssl. Instead, use ""xxd -r"" or similar program to transform the hex signature into a binary signature prior to verification. Source

But, when I try to do this ...
echo ""$(cat my.signature)"" | xxd -r -p > binary.signature
... I get nothing
Can anyone see what I'm doing wrong?
","Dan, the hex signature file is not a plain hex string. It starts with non-hex prefix that xxd failes to parse. Something like RSA-SHA256(my.data)=. You need to remove it before verification.
cat my.signature | sed -e 's/.*= \([^ ]\+\)$/\1/' | xxd -r -p > binary.signature

One little tip. If you used ssh-keygen to create file id_rsa, then corresponding id_rsa.pub is not suitable for openssl, it is in ssh format. You need to generate a public key in PEM format. 
openssl rsa -in id_rsa -pubout > id_rsa.pub.pem

This is the right format for verification.
openssl dgst -verify id_rsa.pub.pem -signature binary.signature my.data
-> Verified OK

As you can see my password is not hashed.
","i have solved this type of issue with this code, check it out
public static String sha256(String base) {
    try{
        MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");
        byte[] hash = digest.digest(base.getBytes(""UTF-8""));
        StringBuffer hexString = new StringBuffer();

        for (int i = 0; i < hash.length; i++) {
            String hex = Integer.toHexString(0xff & hash[i]);
            if(hex.length() == 1) hexString.append('0');
            hexString.append(hex);
        }

        return hexString.toString();
    } catch(Exception ex){
       throw new RuntimeException(ex);
    }
}

then you just call the method and pass the password field
String newPass =  sha256(pass).toString();

Edit: at your question, this would solve the problem
@Override
public void onClick(View v) {

    String pass = password.getText().toString();
    String newPass =  sha256(pass);

    mref = new Firebase(""https://tango-3a561.firebaseio.com/"");
    createNewAccount(email.getText().toString(), newPass );
}

change your method params 
private void createNewAccount(String email,String pass)....

"35970702","Converting encryption password from MD5 to SHA-256, does my protocol has a flaw?","I'm working on a website (PHP + MySQL) that I've got to upgrade. Passwords are stored in the database in MD5, and I'd like it to be something more secure, like SHA-256.
I've already red this question about ""converting"" password hashes, but I got an other idea, and I'd like to know if it brings a security problem or not.
Currently, the passwords are checked in php by hashing (in MD5) the given password and compare it with the hash stored in database, ie: if(md5($password) == $hash)
Let's assume that I hash all the MD5 hashes in SHA-256. I'd have the sha-256 hash of a md5 hash.
Side note: I know it's not more secure to rehash a hash, that's not the point of my question
When a user wants to connect, I'd just have to change the md5($pass) in hash('sha256', md5($password), false) to make it match the value stored in database (assuming $password is the right one)
It seemed a good idea to me as I don't need to keep track of the md5 hash after conversion, ad this doesn't need me to create any new column in my table. I know that this is not going to give me the SHA-256 hash of the original password stored with md5 hash, but this is not my goal. It's just to change the encryption method. Moreover, brute-forcing it seems inefficient, as it is very unlikely that dictionary would have hashes of words...
Does this way of doing it is flawed?
","Simple hashing of passwords is insufficient, it is subject to rainbow tables and is to fast.
Instead in PHP use Safe Password Hashing: password_hash() and password_verify() or a comparable function such as PBKDF2, Bcrypt or script. These function are more secure because of two additions: a repetition count and a random salt. It's all about raising the work factor the attacker must perform.
After all, the point is to have a secure system. Just making it more inconvenient for an attacker is not the answer, there are hacking programs out there to take advantage of poor password security.

"29321108","Crack sha256 when you know the pass form","Is it possible to write a code that can crack the sha256 hash when you know the form of password? For example the password form is *-********** which is 12-13 characters long and:

The first char is one number from 1 to 25
Second one is hyphen 
In each char from the third one to the end, you can put a...z, A...Z and 0...9

After guessing each pass, code converts the pass to sha256 and see whether the result hash is equal to our hash or not and then print the correct pass. 
I know all possible numbers is a big number (26+26+10)^10 but I want to know that:

Is it possible to write such code?
If yes, is it possible to run whole code in less than one day (because I think it takes a lot of time to complete the whole code)?
Since I can't ask you to write a code for me, how and where can I ask for this code?

","You cannot ""crack"" a SHA256 hash no matter how much information you know about the plaintext (assuming by crack you mean derive the plaintext from the hash). Even if you knew the password you could not determine any procedure for reversing the hash. In technical terms, there is no known way to perform a preimage attack on a SHA256 hash.
That means you have to resort to guessing or brute forcing the password:
You have a prefix, which can be any value in [1-25]- and 10 additional characters in [a-zA-Z0-9]. That means the total number of possible passwords is: 25 * 62^10 or 20,982,484,146,708,505,600.
If you were able to compute and check a billion passwords per second it would take you 20,982,484,146 seconds to generate every possible hash. If you start now you'll be finished in about 665 years.
If you are able to leverage some more computing power and generate a trillion hashes per second it would only take a bit more than half a year. The good news is that computing hashes can be done in parallel, so it is easy to utilize multiple machines. The bad news is that kind of computing power isn't going to be cheap.
To answer your questions:

Is it possible to write such code? It is possible to write a program that will iterate over the entire range of possible passwords and check it against the hash(es) you want to determine the plaintext for.
If yes, is it possible to run whole code in less than one day. Yes, if you can compute and check around 10^15 hashes per second.
How and where can I ask for this code? This is the least of your problems.

Fortunately, since bitcoin uses sha256, it is pretty easy to find rough numbers on the amount of computing power it takes to generate the number of hashes you need. 
If the numbers in this article are correct a Raspberry Pi can generate 2*10^5 hashes per second. I believe the newer Raspberry Pis are more powerful than that so I'm going to double that to 4*10^5. You need to generate about 10^15 hashes per second to be done in less than a day.
You're going to need 250,000,000 Raspberry Pis.

","@mrjoltcola is right.
When getting the value from the textarea the new lines are \r\n (CRLF).
You can validate this in your php code by printing the url encoded version of the string that you read like that:
var_dump(urlencode($_POST['text']));

This will print string(12) ""one%0D%0Atwo"" if you enter 
one
two

where %0D is the html code for carriage return and %0A for line feed as you can see here.
Now to get the same hash as in the javascript version you have to remove the carriage return. You can do that it in php like that:
$string_to_be_hashed = preg_replace( ""/\r\n/"", ""\n"", $_POST['text'] );

Then, if you hash the $string_to_be_hashed you will get the expected result.
In the javascript version this happens also internally. If you check the hash256 source code there is a Utf8Encode(string) function where the first line is string = string.replace(/\r\n/g,""\n""); which is essentialy the same.

I can now feed this object with arbitrary strings using the update() method, and at any point I can ask it for the digest of the concatenation of the strings fed to it so far using the digest() or hexdigest() methods.
Well. I would like to feed 1 bit to SHA256 in line with this link ""What is the SHA-256 hash of a single '1' bit?""

So, what is the procedure to hash 1-bit long input consisting of the bit ""1""? (not the 8-bit long byte[] { 1 } input)?
","Neither the hashlib API nor the underlying C module support anything but ""buffers of bytes"".
Since the SHA standard prescribes adding something to any message, regardless of length, you cannot even ""pre-pad"" your input in python to get around that restriction.
To demonstrate (taken from https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4634#section-4.1):
>>> sha256('abcde').hexdigest()

Although calculating the hash of a message with a length that is not a multiple of 8 might technically be allowed, I would very much doubt that there are real world use cases for this (that require the use of only the python standard lib, no less).

","In short:
Encryption is a process with an inverse. In other words: If I encrypt some text, there is a process which is able to convert the new text back to the original, called decryption.
Hashing is fundamentally different from encryption, because it does not have such a process. What a hash is meant to do is provide you with a result, which is unique for that given input text (well, almost unique, let's keep it at unique). This way, people can verify if two input texts were equal, without knowing what the actual input text was. So, if people get their hands on your hashed password, they still cannot decrypt it. SHA is a family of methods which provide hashing.
Salts and Peppers are merely additional techniques to hashing, which describe the process of adding something before and after the input text before hashing. This improves the difficulty of brute-force cracking of hashes back to text. 
Brute force cracking means simply trying all possible inputs (aa, ab, ac, etc...) and see if you can generate a hash which matches the hash you have gotten via hacking some website or whatever.

"8308558","Can anyone describe the difference between password encryption and hash (sha-256)?","I need to save the password to database.I get confused in encryption,hash using sha-256 ,salt generation method .If any one explains the basic concept behind this then it will be helpful
","The follow is a very basic explanation, anyway...

Encryption is a reversible method to crypt the data. So if you have ""password"" a encryption method convert it into (for example) ""ufmehlejw"" and then you are able to get again ""password"".
An hash function (one of them is the sha-256) is a function that once it's used on a string you have no way to recover the original string.
A salt is a string which usually prorammers (and not only, of course) use to mix the given password. It's usually randomly generated. A salt is used to extend the original data before using an hash function. The goal of the salt is to avoid attackers to discover the original password of a user from a stolen hash using rainbow tables.

"29731329","CryptoJS SHA256 Large File Progressive Checksum","I am trying to use CryptoJS to get the checksum of large files( bigger than 500MB) so browser doesn't crash. I am already using a Web Worker with chunking. So, I am try to progressively use each chunk when I iterate through the chunks to update CryptoJS to start creating the checksum. However, it's still returning the wrong checksum at the end when I finalize. It's seems like it's only returning the checksum of the last chunk not the checksum of all the chunks.

"35249059","signtool Dual Signing Failure","Question concerning a failure I'm having when attempting to dual sign with SHA1/SHA256.
I've had a SHA256 code signing certificate for a few years now, but before the new year (2016), I started using /fd SHA256 for the hashing algorithm to be compliant with Microsoft's deprecation of SHA1.
This worked fine, but of course the signature hash doesn't validate on older OS's. I don't care about XP, but I still sort of care about Vista.
I first sign for SHA1 using the following:
signtool sign /fd SHA1 /f ""cert.pfx"" /p ""password"" /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timsetamp.dll ""file""

Then I try for my dual signature:
signtool sign /as /fd SHA256 /f ""cert.pfx"" /p ""password"" /tr http://timestamp.globalsign.com/?signature=sha2 ""file""

And signtool gives me this:

Done Adding Additional Store
SignTool Error: An unexpected internal error has occurred.
Error information: ""Error: SignerSign() failed."" (-2147024846/0x80070032)

Now I can successfully sign a file with a single algorithm (Either SHA1 OR SHA256), but I can't add the second signature. My only guess is that because I'm using the SAME certificate for both algorithms it doesn't like that. Do I need to have a different physical certificate for each algorithm? 
Just wondering because before the new year, I had been using a SHA256 certificate for years with a SHA1 algorithm and it validated fine on all Operating Systems.
","This is from mis-matched dlls.  signtool.exe needs the correct wintrust.dll and mssign32.dll otherwise I get 0x80070032 only when dual signing.

"27171847","XML Signature Reference digest uses parent namespace","I need to sign an XML-File in Java, which needs to contain 3 References.
While 2 of them are valid (expected digest == actual digest), one is invalid.
The relevant part of the XML Looks like:  
<QualifyingProperties xmlns=""http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.3.2#"" Target=""Signature1"">
    <SignedProperties Id=""SignedProperties_1"">
        <SignedSignatureProperties>
            <SigningTime>2014-11-27T13:49:36</SigningTime>
        </SignedSignatureProperties>
    </SignedProperties>
</QualifyingProperties>

The Reference only references the Element ""SignedProperties"" and its children.
As you can see the ""QualifyingProperties"" Element defines a namespace (xmlns=""http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.3.2#"") and i guess thats the problem:
After having a look at the log i found, that the ""Pre-Digest"" Value looks like:  
<SignedProperties xmlns=""http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.3.2#"" Id=""SignedProperties_1"">
    <SignedSignatureProperties>
        <SigningTime>2014-11-27T13:49:36</SigningTime>
    </SignedSignatureProperties>
</SignedProperties>

While the ""SignedProperties"" Element in the real file does not contain the namespace, but its parent does.
I found out, that the actual digest matches the SHA-256 of the ""Pre-Digest"" value, while the expected digest matches the SHA-256 of the real file (without the namespace).  
The Reference is created with the following code:
Reference sigPropRef = fac.newReference(""#SignedProperties_1"", fac.newDigestMethod(DigestMethod.SHA256, null),
    Collections.singletonList(sigPropTransform), ""http://uri.etsi.org/01903#SignedProperties"", ""reference-signedpropeties""
);

Where the sigPropTransform is a CanonicalizationMethod.EXCLUSIVE Transform.
My question is, how can i solve the problem, i.e. how can i prevent the namespace to be added to the ""SignedProperties"" Element, before calculating the digest?
If you need any other informations please leave a comment, i am pretty new to this theme, so i am not sure which informations are relevant and which not.
Thanks a lot!
EDIT: After playing arround a bit, it seems to me, that the ""actual digest"" is the digest, the validator calculated, while the ""expected digest"" is the digest inside the ""DigestValue"" Element.
That means, that the digest value inside my file matches the SHA-256 of the referenced filepart, but the validator for some reason calculates the digest WITh the parents namespace.
So i guess what i need is to include the parents namespace in my digest calculation.

"27171847","XML Signature Reference digest uses parent namespace","I need to sign an XML-File in Java, which needs to contain 3 References.
While 2 of them are valid (expected digest == actual digest), one is invalid.
The relevant part of the XML Looks like:  
<QualifyingProperties xmlns=""http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.3.2#"" Target=""Signature1"">
    <SignedProperties Id=""SignedProperties_1"">
        <SignedSignatureProperties>
            <SigningTime>2014-11-27T13:49:36</SigningTime>
        </SignedSignatureProperties>
    </SignedProperties>
</QualifyingProperties>

The Reference only references the Element ""SignedProperties"" and its children.
As you can see the ""QualifyingProperties"" Element defines a namespace (xmlns=""http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.3.2#"") and i guess thats the problem:
After having a look at the log i found, that the ""Pre-Digest"" Value looks like:  
<SignedProperties xmlns=""http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.3.2#"" Id=""SignedProperties_1"">
    <SignedSignatureProperties>
        <SigningTime>2014-11-27T13:49:36</SigningTime>
    </SignedSignatureProperties>
</SignedProperties>

While the ""SignedProperties"" Element in the real file does not contain the namespace, but its parent does.
I found out, that the actual digest matches the SHA-256 of the ""Pre-Digest"" value, while the expected digest matches the SHA-256 of the real file (without the namespace).  
The Reference is created with the following code:
Reference sigPropRef = fac.newReference(""#SignedProperties_1"", fac.newDigestMethod(DigestMethod.SHA256, null),
    Collections.singletonList(sigPropTransform), ""http://uri.etsi.org/01903#SignedProperties"", ""reference-signedpropeties""
);

Where the sigPropTransform is a CanonicalizationMethod.EXCLUSIVE Transform.
My question is, how can i solve the problem, i.e. how can i prevent the namespace to be added to the ""SignedProperties"" Element, before calculating the digest?
If you need any other informations please leave a comment, i am pretty new to this theme, so i am not sure which informations are relevant and which not.
Thanks a lot!
EDIT: After playing arround a bit, it seems to me, that the ""actual digest"" is the digest, the validator calculated, while the ""expected digest"" is the digest inside the ""DigestValue"" Element.
That means, that the digest value inside my file matches the SHA-256 of the referenced filepart, but the validator for some reason calculates the digest WITh the parents namespace.
So i guess what i need is to include the parents namespace in my digest calculation.
EDIT: I continued playing arround and now i have not only the Pre-Digest value of the validator but also the one of my ""digest calculation"".

The namespace xmlns=""http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.3.2#"" is never included.
How do i include it?
","After a few more tries i finally found the actuall problem, as well as the solution:
As i allready stated in the question, the digest calculation did not use the parents namespace, defined as xmlns=""http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.3.2#"".
This was, because i did never ""register"" it as a namespace, but i only added it as a normal Attribute.
To ""register"" the namespace i need to call setAttributeNS instead of setAttribute.
The code then looks something like:  
Element eQualifyingProperties= doc.createElement(""QualifyingProperties"");
eQualifyingProperties.setAttributeNS(""http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/"", ""xmlns"", ""http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.3.2#"");   

The first parameter is the namespace-uri of the Attribute and since the Attribute is a namespace it is the URI of the XML-Namespaces.
The second parameter is the attribute-name, since it should not have any praefix it is simply ""xmlns"".
The third parameter is the actual attibute-value, which is the namespace-uri i want to ""register"".
The Element eQualifyingProperties is the parent of the ""SignedProperties"" Element.  
After registering the namespace as a real namespace (not as an attribute), the defined Transform
Transform sigPropTransform = fac.newTransform(CanonicalizationMethod.EXCLUSIVE, (ExcC14NParameterSpec)null);  

includes it in the digest calculation.  
I found this solution in this answer on SO.

"50615993","HMAC hashing with Base64 encoding with Javascript","I am working with Payeezy API to handle payment on a webapp, their API for purchase requires a HMAC of payload signed using api secret. An excerpt from the docs: 

Construct the data param by appending the parameters below in the same order as shown. a. apikey - API key of the developer. b. nonce - secure random number. c. timestamp - epoch timestamp in milliseconds. d. token - Merchant Token. e. payload - Actual body content passed as post request. Compute HMAC SHA256 hash on the above data param using the key below f. apiSecret - Consumer Secret token for the given api key Calculate the base64 of the hash which would be our required Authorization header value.

I found a library called jshashes on NPM and I tried to use their library to hash my header params, my code looks like this: 
const payload = {
        ""merchant_ref"": ""1-Sale"",
        ""transaction_type"": ""purchase"",
        ""method"": ""credit_card"",
        ""amount"": amount * 100,
        ""partial_redemption"": ""false"",
        ""currency_code"": ""USD"",
        ""credit_card"": {
          ""type"": type,
          ""cardholder_name"": cardholder_name,
          ""card_number"": card_number,
          ""exp_date"": exp_date,
          ""cvv"": cvv
        }
      }
      const data = apikey + nounce + timestamp + token + JSON.stringify(payload)
      const sha256 = new Hashes.SHA256()
      const shaData = sha256.b64_hmac(apiSecret, data)

The outcome compared to the sample hashed value looks like this:
//mine
beWtpCGDv/iBoAUDAThGFXIge9eli/Xtl7JIBuR1bd4= 


//payeezy sample 
NmUzMTNmYWU0YjExM2UxMmM0NjllZGI1NThjY2M5MmUzMzE3NTFlZmQ1NDQxYzAzMTgwMmIwNDQ0MWVmYTdhMw== 

from the looks of the character counts I could tell that my hashing process is not correct but I can't figure out where went wrong. 
I've seen similar questions being asked here but none answered, any help is appreciated.
ADDITION, I tried crypto library on Node.js:
const data = apikey + nounce + timestamp + token + JSON.stringify(payload)

  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha512', apiSecret)

  hmac.on('readable', () => {
    const data = hmac.read()
    if (data) {
      console.log(data.toString('base64'));
    }
  })

  hmac.write(data)
  hmac.end()

Same result, with only half the character length compared to the sample hashed value
UPDATE: After I used SHA512 on the data it finally returned a string that looks to have the same character length as the sample, but the validation is still not passing... 
","if you convert the base64 example from that site to a string


console.log(atob('NmUzMTNmYWU0YjExM2UxMmM0NjllZGI1NThjY2M5MmUzMzE3NTFlZmQ1NDQxYzAzMTgwMmIwNDQ0MWVmYTdhMw=='))



You get 
6e313fae4b113e12c469edb558ccc92e331751efd5441c031802b04441efa7a3

This is a 64 character (256 bit) hex string
So my guess is that they get the hex string HMAC, and base64 encode that - which seems awfully stupid, hex is safe to send as is, why make it 4/3rds larger!!
if they simply used the base64 of the HMAC, it'd only be 45 characters long!!
Instead they get the 64 character hex string and base64 encode that to get 88 characters!! strange design decision!!
So, your code should do the same
like
Data = Buffer.from(sha256.hex_hmac(apiSecret, data), 'utf-8').toString('base64');

not sure if there's a better way in node to convert hex encoded string to base64, but that works
And finally (actually this bit is just to ""match"" how the authorization is calculated on the example page as linked by the OP https://developer.payeezy.com/payeezy-api/apis/post/transactions-3) So, it's not necessary to make the payload larger for no reason)
Another point you need to know, the payload JSON needs to be in a specific format it seems ... 2 space indented ... again, this is a damned stupid waste of bandwidth ..  {""key"":1234} takes 12 characters 
{
  ""key"": 1234
}

takes 17
So, anyway, you need to do this:
JSON.stringify(payload,null, 2)

This last piece of the puzzle should make your code as follows
const data = apikey + nonce + timestamp + token + JSON.stringify(payload,null, 2)
const sha256 = new Hashes.SHA256()
const shaData = Buffer.from(sha256.hex_hmac(secret, data), 'utf-8').toString('base64');

","There isn't even a guarantee that this will work the same way on the same machine from one run to another, as some implementations of JPEG encoding are non-deterministic.
Your algorithm so far is:

Get file.
Do arbitrary stuff with it that isn't actually used.
Store this in memory via a memory stream.
Take it out of memory via a memory stream.
Get hash of output of arbitrary stuff.

Your algorithm should be:

Get file.
Get hash of file.

You don't need to even care whether it is a JPEG file or not. The one possible advantage is that your code would throw an exception if .NET couldn't handle it as an image (a disadvantage in most cases, but an advantage if it's better to fail now than down the line). If that's necessary, you could call Image.FromFile() separately from the hashing.

We were using a SHA-1 certificate for the past few years for signing the manifest and the assemblies. The application has been deployed for a lot of end-users. Now with the SHA-1 deprecation policy coming into effect from January 2016, the renewed certificate that has been issued by the CA is keyed using SHA-256. 
Please have a look at the files generated by building a Excel 2010 VSTO Add-in, using various versions of Visual Studio:
NOTE: The certificate used for all the following cases is keyed using SHA-2 algorithm.
.VSTO generated by VS 2010 SP1, Target Framework 4.0:
The DigestMethod Algorithm mentioned for the dependentAssembly's hash is SHA1, even when SHA2 certificate was used.

        <dsig:DigestValue>DIGEST VALUE</dsig:DigestValue>
    </hash>
</dependentAssembly>

Under publisherIdentity tag, the SignatureMethod and the DigestMethod used is SHA256, which is according to the certificate's algorithm.
<SignatureMethod Algorithm=""http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha256"" />

Similarly, under publisherIdentity tag, SignatureMethod and DigestMethod are still using SHA1. The .vsto file build using VS 2010 and VS 2013 SP1 are having SHA2 here.
<SignatureMethod Algorithm=""http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1"" />

<DigestMethod Algorithm=""http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#sha1"" />

Will this work/be supported even after January 2016/17?
.VSTO generated by VS 2013 SP4 and VS 2015, Target Framework 4.5.2:
Please note the algorithm mentioned in <dsig:DigestMethod Algorithm=""http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#sha2"" /> tag is SHA2.

        <dsig:DigestValue>DIGEST VALUE</dsig:DigestValue>
    </hash>
</dependentAssembly>

SignatureMethod and DigestMethod are now indicating SHA2 algorithm.
<SignatureMethod Algorithm=""http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha2"" />

<DigestMethod Algorithm=""http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#sha2"" />

It seems that the update in VS 2013 SP3 (also available in VS 2015) is using/enforcing the algorithm as per the .Net Framework being targeted. 
For .Net Framework 4.0, the DigestMethod and SigntureMethod are always SHA1, irrespective of the certificate used. Now the add-in works on machine having only .Net 4.0 as the VSTO/clickonce loader does not have to deal with SHA2 at all.
So, considering that SHA-2 certificates have to be used starting January 2016, what should be the configuration used for signing the add-in with SHA-2 certificate?

VS 2010, .Net Framework 4.0 and SHA-2 certificate (Does not work without .Net Framework 4.5 or newer installed on the machine)
VS 2015, .Net Framework 4.0 and SHA-2 certificate (This is no different from using SHA-1 certificates. The VSTO files have only SHA-1 entries, not sure whether this will work after January 2016)
VS 2015, .Net Framework 4.5.2 and SHA-2 certificate (Not suitable for me. I need to keep the target framework as 4.0)

I am installing the Excel add-ins on machines offline. They are always loaded from the file system.

","Your key is different from the C# version. Try to convert the hex string to raw bytes. This way crypto knows to take the bytes instead of the actual string.
For example:
var crypto = require('crypto');

","
If values generated by sha256 can be assumed to be distributed uniformly and randomly, then there exists with probability 1/e (about 37%) a 256-bit sequence whose sha256 hash is equal to itself. If so, the minimum sequence length is one.
On the other hand, based on the pigeonhole principle, we know that the sequence must repeat after no more than 2256 iterations. This doesn't say anything about the brokenness of sha256.
The maximum cycle length is 2256 ≈ 1.16×1077 iterations. If you can evaluate 1012 hashes per second, then working your way through all possible hashes would take you about 1065 seconds (about one quindecillion times the age of the earth). Even if you're fortunate enough find a loop in a tiny fraction of that time, you're still liable to be waiting for trillions of years.
Good luck with that. If every atom in our galaxy was used to store a separate hash value, you would run out of space after storing less than one billionth of the total number of hashes. (Source: number of atoms in milky way galaxy ≈ 1068)

","
Digest::MD5 was first released as a Core module with perl v5.7.3 (March 2002) [1]. The oldest version of perl being widely used today is v5.8.8, so any perl you are going to encounter will have this module available.
The oldest version of Digest::MD5 which I could find (v1.99.59-TRIAL from 1998) already has the add and addfile methods. So whatever version of that module you encounter, you will have the add method available.

You can therefore safely rely on that functionality, instead of having to use some ugly and unportable hack like calling a command line tool.
Make sure that you traverse each directory in a specific order so that the checksum is reproducible.
Note that MD5 is an effectively broken algorithm, which shouldn't be used except to interface with legacy systems. The SHA-2 family of hash functions is preferable for most tasks where a fast hash is required.

[1] Use the corelist command line tool from Module::Corelist to query core modules of different perl versions.

","From the docs.

If this cipher requires any algorithm parameters that cannot be
  derived from the given key, the underlying cipher implementation is
  supposed to generate the required parameters itself (using
  provider-specific default or random values) if it is being initialized
  for encryption or key wrapping, and raise an InvalidKeyException if it
  is being initialized for decryption or key unwrapping. The generated
  parameters can be retrieved using getParameters or getIV (if the
  parameter is an IV).

A very simple way of encrypting is taking your hash and XOR it with the bytes in the file in a loop (256 bits at a time). It's kind of a low-level approach but you won't need to debug the API. You should be able to implement this with very minimal code.

","I cant comment to your question yet, so i am trying to reply here, but not sure if i am thinking right about what you are asking.
Seems you want a way to assure no one changed your file after it loaded in memory.
That's why you want a sha-256 hash of that section, and probably you need to get that section and then hash it.
I never used JCL classes to do that. But found this unit that maybe help for you. It allow you to edit PE files. Was written in 2007, so maybe you will need upgrade some code. But i am most sure you will find the bases to what you want.
http://www.coderprofile.com/networks/source-codes/71/portable-executable-file-unit
I could not test it at all. But till what i tested, the start address did not changed here..
To get the Sha-256, will find many VCL components (or at least ActiveX) to do that. I could advise you to use LIBEAY32.DLL, but that would probably add one more dll to your application. Unless you already use it.
Hope that help in anyway.

","Wikipedia:

The SHA-2 family consists of six hash functions with digests (hash
  values) that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384,
  SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256.

I think SHA-2 a ""family"" of hash algorithms and SHA-256 a specific algorithm in that family. Can anyone clear up the confusion.
","The SHA-2 family consists of multiple closely related hash functions. It is essentially a single algorithm in which a few minor parameters are different among the variants.
The initial spec only covered 224, 256, 384 and 512 bit variants.
The most significant difference between the variants is that some are 32 bit variants and some are 64 bit variants. In terms of performance this is the only difference that matters.
On a 32 bit CPU SHA-224 and SHA-256 will be a lot faster than the other variants because they are the only 32 bit variants in the SHA-2 family. Executing the 64 bit variants on a 32 bit CPU will be slow due to the added complexity of performing 64 bit operations on a 32 bit CPU.
On a 64 bit CPU SHA-224 and SHA-256 will be a little slower than the other variants. This is because due to only processing 32 bits at a time, they will have to perform more operations in order to make it through the same number of bytes. You do not get quite a doubling in speed from switching to a 64 bit variant because the 64 bit variants do have a larger number of rounds than the 32 bit variants.
The internal state is 256 bits in size for the two 32 bit variants and 512 bits in size for all four 64 bit variants. So the number of possible sizes for the internal state is less than the number of possible sizes for the final output. Going from a large internal state to a smaller output can be good or bad depending on your point of view.
If you keep the output size fixed it can in general be expected that increasing the size of the internal state will improve security. If you keep the size of the internal state fixed and decrease the size of the output, collisions become more likely, but length extension attacks may become easier. Making the output size larger than the internal state would be pointless.
Due to the 64 bit variants being both faster (on 64 bit CPUs) and likely to be more secure (due to larger internal state), two new variants were introduced using 64 bit words but shorter outputs. Those are the ones known as 512/224 and 512/256.
The reasons for wanting variants with output that much shorter than the internal state is usually either that for some usages it is impractical to use such a long output or that the output need to be used as key for some algorithm that takes an input of a certain size.
Simply truncating the final output to your desired length is also possible. For example a HMAC construction specify truncating the final hash output to the desired MAC length. Due to HMAC feeding the output of one invocation of the hash as input to another invocation it means that using a hash with shorter output results in a HMAC with less internal state. For this reason it is likely to be slightly more secure to use HMAC-SHA-512 and truncate the output to 384 bits than to use HMAC-SHA-384.
The final output of SHA-2 is simply the internal state (after processing length extended input) truncated to the desired number of output bits. The reason SHA-384 and SHA-512 on the same input look so different is that a different IV is specified for each of the variants.

(Actual question: Is this a reasonable way of generating a random salt for a password?)
","The hash function SHA2 will not add any entrophy to the resulting salt, it just brings the result of rand() into another form. That means, all depends on the rand() function and it's implementation.
The function rand() is of course not random, if you know the state of the function (the last result), you can predict the next generated value. The state itself is based on a seed, sometimes this seed is set automatically by the application. PHP for example creates a seed from the current time and the process-id. Note that those values are somewhat predictable too, or at least will narrow down the range of possible results.
I don't know the MYSQL implementation of rand, but i would not recommend to use its rand() function to generate a salt. Actually i would never let the database generate the salt or the hash value of a password, because most databases do not provide an appropriate way to hash passwords. Instead use the development environment with a slow key-derivation function like BCrypt, such functions often create a safe salt automatically.
To answer your question, uniqueness is the main purpose of the salt, so there are weaker ways to generate a salt. Better would be a salt that is unpredictable too, so nobody can precalculate the salt (ranges of possible salts), and therefore can prepare an attack. The best way to get a salt is, to use the random source of the operating system (URANDOM).

SELECT SHA2(RAND(), 256);

generate?
(Actual question: Is this a reasonable way of generating a random salt for a password?)
","Let's break this down.
SHA2 can refer to one of 4 algorithms:

SHA224 - 224 bits of output
SHA256 - 256 bits of output
SHA384 - 384 bits of output
SHA512 - 512 bits of output

So they each take an arbitrary input (0 to 2^64-1 bits of data), and produce an output of a fixed size.
Note that no entropy is actually created here. However, when feeding in more than the output size bits of entropy, some is destroyed. And when we take into account the (small) possibility of collisions, sometimes inputs smaller than the output size can have entropy destroyed. Therefore, we can say that each function places an upper bound of entropy as its output size.
So hashing can't increase entropy. So that means our upper bound on entropy is the lesser of the output size of the hash, and the size of the input.
Now, your input is RAND(). Assuming that you're referring to MySQL's RAND() function, let's look at what's happening. The RAND() function produces a floating point result. Now, MySQL uses a 4-byte floating point value for FLOAT data types. That means that at most, the result contains 32 bits of entropy.
Therefore, the combination is already down to an upper bound of 32 bits of entropy. 
Thanks to the Birthday Paradox, at 32 bits of entropy, we're at a 50% chance of a collision in just 7,000 generations. That's way too low for an effective salt...
And that doesn't even touch the fact that RAND() is predictable (which isn't the end of the world in the case of a salt).
Instead, just use a library to handle the generation for you. In PHP, I'd suggest password-compat or phpass.
In other languages, I am not sure. But seriously, don't reinvent it. Just use a library (preferably one that uses bcrypt or scrypt) and be done with it.

"24093199","A ""pure"" scheme implementation (R5RS) of SHA256?","I can use SHA256 in Scheme using external libraries (Java, C or system dependent) or using a specific Scheme implementation (like Chicken e.g.), but I wonder if there is a ""pure"" scheme implementation.
","I wrote an implementation today. Alas, R5RS has neither bytevectors nor binary I/O, so this uses the R7RS APIs for bytevectors and binary I/O. It should be easy to bridge those APIs to your Scheme implementation's native APIs (for example, I actually tested my implementation on Racket and Guile).
A few notes:

This code assumes case-sensitivity. This is the default for R7RS, but not R5RS, so if you're using an R5RS implementation, beware.
It requires SRFIs 1, 26, 43, and 60.
I emphasise elegance and clarity over speed. In fact, the code is quite slow.

I implemented all the algorithms in FIPS 180-4, but you can strip out whatever you don't need.

As mentioned before, I tested this on Racket; the definitions I added to bridge to Racket's APIs are as follows:
#lang racket
(require (only-in srfi/1 iota)
         (only-in srfi/26 cut)
         (only-in srfi/43 vector-unfold)
         (only-in srfi/60 bitwise-if rotate-bit-field)
         (rename-in racket/base [build-list list-tabulate]
                                [bytes-copy! bytevector-copy!]
                                [bytes-length bytevector-length]
                                [bytes-ref bytevector-u8-ref]
                                [bytes-set! bytevector-u8-set!]
                                [foldl fold]
                                [make-bytes make-bytevector]
                                [read-bytes! read-bytevector!]
                                [string->bytes/utf-8 string->utf8]
                                [subbytes bytevector-copy]))

And here are the definitions for Guile (requires version 2.0.11 or above):
(use-modules (srfi srfi-1) (srfi srfi-26) (srfi srfi-43) (srfi srfi-60)
             (rnrs bytevectors) (ice-9 binary-ports))

(define* (bytevector-copy bv #:optional (start 0) (end (bytevector-length bv)))
  (define copy (make-bytevector (- end start)))
  (bytevector-copy! copy 0 bv start end)
  copy)
(define* (bytevector-copy! to at from #:optional (start 0)
                                                 (end (bytevector-length from)))
  ((@ (rnrs bytevectors) bytevector-copy!) from start to at (- end start)))
(define* (read-bytevector! bv #:optional (port (current-input-port)) (start 0)
                                         (end (bytevector-length bv)))
  (get-bytevector-n! port bv start (- end start)))

It should be easy to make something similar for your chosen implementation.

I also have a function that prints out the output as a hex string, for ready comparison with various command-line SHA-1 and SHA-2 utilities (e.g., sha1sum, sha256sum, sha512sum, etc.):
(define (hex bv)
  (define out (open-output-string))
  (do ((i 0 (+ i 1)))
      ((>= i (bytevector-length bv)) (get-output-string out))
    (let-values (((q r) (truncate/ (bytevector-u8-ref bv i) 16)))
      (display (number->string q 16) out)
      (display (number->string r 16) out))))

"37335481","What is different about HashAlgorithm is new SHA256Managed() vs. SHA256Managed.Create()","I seem to be seeing SHA-2 being done 2 different ways. 
Yes I get that 1 is ""newed"" (instantiated) vs. a Create Method on the other but it seems that that achieve the same identical object 
HashAlgorithm sha2 = new SHA256Managed();

vs.            

SHA256 sha2 = SHA256Managed.Create();

Does ""sha2"" act the same? if not what is the difference and why are there 2 types written?
","The .Create method might give you a platform optimized version of implementation (though the current code from Microsoft might not use that opportunity in all possible places). 
For example, if this call is made on a machine with hardware encryption support, it might return a hardware-specific version.
Thus, it would be a better option to avoid using a specific implementation in your own code.

-(void)hash:(NSData *)input

    NSMutableData *result = [NSMutableData dataWithLength:CC_SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH];

    CC_SHA256(CFBridgingRetain(input), input.length, result.mutableBytes);

    NSLog(@""RESULT is %@"", result);
}

This algorithm appears to be working correctly. A little test:
NSString* str = @""abcde"";
NSData* data = [str dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

[self hash:data];

NSString* str2 = @""fghijk"";
NSData* data2 = [str2 dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

[self hash:data2];

Gives the following output:
Input is 6162636465
RESULT is <91681b5f 162cf494 238e5cac 0debbe92 c3ede9bf 4bcc7e79 845b774f b33e99f7>

RESULT is <cccf7b6f 9acb96ae 84e9852b 1a753825 d6750555 57175c78 f86cf5fb bb3cfca7>

Now, if I change the second argument (input.length) to 3, I get the following output:
Input is 6162636465
RESULT is <5e83c408 f722bb9a 9f602d85 c186bcb1 ebb8fa2f 0df2cc08 5eaf2522 92b01570>

These hashes are the same. I would expect the CC_SHA256 algorithm to just hash the first 3 characters of my input, but apparently, it doesn't work like that. Furthermore, if I relaunch the simulator, the hashes that are generated are different than the first time (but still equal to each other).
Why is this behaviour happening? Please don't give an (obvious) workaround for this problem. I really want to know why the algorithm behaves this way.
","SHA (and any hashing algorithm) should be deterministic and so the fact that it varies between launches shows that you are likely using it incorrectly.
My guess is if you just pass in the reference of input you are hashing some internal data related to NSData and thus the first few bytes are the same but different between lanches. 
Check out one of these other questions (Sha256 in Objective-C for iPhone) for a proper implementation of SHA-256 on iOS.

"15084452","Convert a clientsecret into a private key","I'm working with Google Cloud Storage in AppEngine and I'm attempting to use a POST form to upload a file to GCS.  The problem I'm having is with the steps needed to sign the policy document.  I can easily fetch the client_secret, which is a String from the client_secrets.json that the API Console gave me.  however, in order to create a signature, I need to convert that string into a PrivateKey object.  Here's what my code looks like:
//create the policy document and encode it
String policyDocument = ...  //omitted for brevity
String encodedPolicy = Base64.encodeString(policyDocument);

//sign using SHA256 with RSA
String secretKey = ... //I fetch this from client_secrets.json
Signature sig = Signature.getInstance(""SHA256withRSA"");
sig.initSign(secretKey); //THIS IS THE PROBLEM!  
sig.update(encodedPolicy.getBytes(""UTF-8""));        
String signature = new String(Base64.encode(sig.sign()));

//put the values in the request attributes so we can fetch them from a JSP
req.setAttribute(""policy"", encodedPolicy);
req.setAttribute(""signature"", signature);

As noted above, my problem is in the line
sig.initSign(secretKey); //THIS IS THE PROBLEM!  

secretKey is a String.  Signature.initSign() expects a PrivateKey, or one of its descendant objects.  How do I convert the string in the client_secrets.json into a PrivateKey (or derived) object that I can pass Signature.initSign?
Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks
OK, here's where I am right now.  I tried the suggestions below, and all of the documentation is urging me to use the client_secret in the client_secrets.json file downloaded from the Google API console, not the service account.  And besides, I'm trying to construct an example of a user's upload, not a service account.  
I found the following code on another page:
public static String signPolicyDocument(String policyDocument, String secret) {     
try {
        Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA256"");
        byte[] secretBytes = secret.getBytes();
        SecretKeySpec signingKey = new SecretKeySpec(secretBytes, ""HmacSHA256"");
        mac.init(signingKey);
        byte[] signedSecretBytes = mac.doFinal(policyDocument.getBytes());          
        return new String(Base64.encode(signedSecretBytes));
    } catch (InvalidKeyException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }

And it gets me all the way through the process...until I submit the resulting form.  Then I get the following response: 
The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your Google secret key and signing method.

What signing method is it looking for?
","Here's what I think you need to do:
KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
PKCS8EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(keyBytes);
PrivateKey privateKey = keyFactory.generatePrivate(keySpec);

","The final answer to this problem is like the conclusion of Wargames.  As WOPR said, ""A strange game...the only way to win is not to play.""  Avoid signing and policy document and all that crap and use the blobstore.
(See this:  https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/blobstore/overview#using-blobstore-with-gcs)  
It's very easy to implement; when you create your temporary blobstore upload URL like so:
    //open the blobstore service and create the upload url
    BlobstoreService bs = BlobstoreServiceFactory.getBlobstoreService();        
    String uploadUrl = bs.createUploadUrl(""/display"",
            UploadOptions.Builder.withGoogleStorageBucketName(bucket));

The downside to this approach is the object name will be a string of characters you don't recognize.  You can open the blobstore viewer and see your object by file name in the blobstore, but in GCS its object name will be gobbledygook.  (A hash, maybe?  A randomly assigned ID)?

I'm using this Perl code:

Is there somewhere else I should look for a 2048 bit (256 byte) key used by google to sign JWTs for Google Identity Toolkit? Or is there a way to verify a 256 byte signature with a 128 byte public key? Or am I extracting the public key from the cert incorrectly? The fact that the signature is 256 bytes implies that the public key I use to verify the signature should also be 256 bytes as far as I can tell. 
I also tried using the JSON::WebToken CPAN module but had the same problem with the key being shorter than the signature. 
","Google provides the gitkit library ported to various languages, and it has (at least for the node.js version which I use) a method for retrieving the public key handily from a common uri.

Check here for API reference and the uri from which the gitgit library gets the public key: https://developers.google.com/identity/toolkit/web/reference/relyingparty/getPublicKeys.

","You're missing a '0' at the start, because you're padding left to 40 characters (presumably having copied that code from something where the hash is expected to be 40 characters) instead of the 64 characters that actually makes up a SHA-256 hash (in hex).
So you could just fix the padLeft code - but personally I would just avoid using BigInteger for hex conversions. That's not what it's designed for - it's designed for maths operations on large integers.
Instead, use one of the many hex converters in common utility libraries - which are designed precisely to convert byte arrays to hex, with nothing about integers at all. If you don't want to use a library, there's plenty of code on Stack Overflow to convert a byte[] to hex.

"25044582","How to extend vertex shader capabalities for GPGPU","I'm trying to implement Scrypt hasher (for LTC miner) on GLSL (don't ask me why).
And, actually, I'm stucked with HMAC SHA-256 algorithm. Despite I've implemented SHA-256 correctly (it retuns corrent hash for input), fragment shader stops to compile when I add  the last step (hashing previous hash concated with oKey).
The shader can't do more than three rounds of SHA-256. It just stops to compile. What are the limits? It doesn't use much memory, 174 vec2 objects in total. It seems, it doesn't relate to memory, because any extra SHA256 round doesn't require new memory. And it seems, it doesn't relate to viewport size. It stops to work on both 1x1 and 1x128 viewports.
I've started to do miner on WebGL, but after limit appeared, I've tried to run the same shader in the Qt on the full featured OpenGL. In result, desktop OpenGL allows one SHA256 round lesser then OpenGL ES in WebGL (why?).
Forgot to mention. Shader fails on the linkage stage. The shader compiles well itself, but the program linkage fails.
I don't use any textures, any extensions, slow things etc. Just simple square (4 vec2 vertecies) and several uniforms for fragment shader. 
Input data is just 80 bytes, the result of fragment shader is binary (black or white), so the task ideally fits the GLSL principes. 
My videocard is Radeon HD7970 with plenty of VRAM, which is able to fit hundreds of scrypt threads (scrypt uses 128kB per hash, but I can't achieve just HMAC-SHA-256). My card supports OpenGL 4.4.
I'm newbie in OpenGL, and may understand something wrong. I understand that fragment shader runs for each pixel separately, but if I have 1x128 viewport, there are only 128x348 bytes used. Where is the limit of fragment shader. 
Here is the common code I use to let you understand, how I'm trying to solve the problem.

","I try to answer on the my own question. 
Shader is a small processor with limited registers and cache memory. Also, there are limit for instruction execution. So, the whole architecture to fit all into one fragment shader is wrong.
On another way, you can change your shader programs during render tens or hundreds times. It is normal practice.
It is necessary to divide big computation into smaller parts and render them separately. Use render-to-texture to save your work. 
Due to the webgl statistic, 96.5% of clients has MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE eq 4096. It gives you 32 megabytes of memory. It can contain the draft data for 256 threads of scrypt computation.

","I suspect in the first example, $userid is an integer and the column id is some type of INT  as well, so it's being cast to integer and working fine 
The second where clause you're adding to query, the result of the SHA2 funciton is clearly not an integer but a string, so it should be in quotes:
   $query = ""
       SELECT
        A.id
        U.email,
        SHA2(U.email, 256) AS sha
       FROM S.Action A
       LEFT JOIN S.Users U
        ON U.ID = A.id
        WHERE A.id = "". $id ."" AND SHA2(U.email, 256) = '"".$pass.""'"";   

Note that if this input is coming from user input, you'll want to use parameters and not concatenate the query together as is done above. This could open your site up to SQL injection attacks.

","If you call the function login() as you have it written all that will happen is that a hash of the word ""password"" will be generated and assigned to the variable p. -- and that is all! 
If you want a working function you need to do something with this variable p. You could start by looking at what is being generated by adding console.log(p) inside the function and taking a look at your console.
And if all you are looking for is the hash of ""password"" you can return p.

What is the difference between the below two way of calculating sha256 ?
Way1: Just call SHA256 method like below
SHA256((unsigned char*)buffer_to_hash, buffer_size, hashed_payload);
Way2: Use SHA256_CTX, SHA256_Init, SHA256_Update and SHA256_Final. As mentioned here
generate sha256 with openssl and C++
Both the programs produce the same result
Example for both methods have been mentioned here
","Modulo bugs and such, the two have basically different intents. The first does batch style processing. That is to say: you give it one complete string, and it produces a hash of that complete string.
The second does hashing incrementally. If you don't have (or want) access to the entire string to be hashed at once, it allows you to read some data, operate on it, read some more, operate on it, and so on until you've read all the data. At the end, you can get the overall hash of the entire data stream.
Just for example, let's assume you're running this on a computer with 4 Gigs of RAM, and you want to hash a 16 gigabyte file. Since the data won't fit in RAM (or even close to it) the second is probably a better choice for this case. Likewise, if you're receiving data over the network, but don't (necessarily) want to store all the raw packets just so you can hash them and (for example) acknowledge receipt.

","Hashing is the one-way transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value or key that represents the original string.
The SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) is one of a number of cryptographic hash functions. A cryptographic hash is like a signature for a text or a data file. SHA-256 algorithm generates an almost-unique, fixed size 256-bit (32-byte) hash. 
SHA-256 is one of the successor hash functions to SHA-1, and is one of the strongest hash functions available.
Every hashing cannot revert by calculation but you can map between brute force hashed plaintext like
a -> ca978112ca1bbdcafac231b39a23dc4da786eff8147c4e72b9807785afee48bb
b -> 3e23e8160039594a33894f6564e1b1348bbd7a0088d42c4acb73eeaed59c009d
.
.

if you meet the same hashing data, it means that you know plaintext.
Normally,people generate the map of plaintext and hashed-text then they use database lookup.
So, this website provides the big hashing database that you can try revert it.
Although, you can use this method to revert hashing, no one have every possible word hasing database. It just contains only words on dictionary or commonly used words for password.
For more information you can use these keywords :  ""rainbow table"", ""hashing"" , ""reverse hashing lookup"", ""cryptographic hash functions""

","The SHA-256 is designed, to make it impossible to find the original value by looking at the output. For short passwords it is feasible to do a brute-force attack and just try out any combination until one finds a match.
In your case the $code you need to find, is a 64 character string, which looks like the hex representation of a random 32 byte key. With 32 bytes of information you can describe about 1E77 combinations, so with 15 Giga SHA256/second you would still need about 1E58 years to brute-force.
So unless you can find out additional information about the key (e.g. a certain scheme), it is not possible to get the code. Nevertheless, the example is a bad implementation of a random number generator, it would be much safer and cheaper to read one byte from the random source of the operating system.

","From the Long docs:
public static long parseLong(String s) throws NumberFormatException:

Parses the string argument as a signed decimal long. The characters in the string must all be decimal digits...

public static long parseLong(String s, int radix) throws NumberFormatException:

Parses the string argument as a signed long in the radix specified by the second argument. The characters in the string must all be digits of the specified radix...

You're calling the first version of Long.parseLong(), which expects a decimal number, not a binary one. Use the second version with a radix of 2 to indicate binary.
EDIT: The reason being that a 32-digit decimal number won't fit into a Long, but a binary one will.

","Do not use sha256,md5 etc for password hashing. I think you should use BCrypt for password hashing. This is the most powerful password hashing algorithm at present. password_hash() and password_verify() are used to hash and verify password for BCrypt. PHP 5.5.0 or greater uses BCrypt as default algorithm for password_hash(). Do not use your own salt. Let password_hash() do it for you.

I can't store the key for the encryption in the system

You haven't. You're hashing, you're not encrypting. salt !== key

if someone got the file they could decrypt the password

No. Nothing is encrypted, so there's nothing to decrypt. They'd get only the resulting hash, which they'd still have to brute force.

Is my process flawed? 

Yes, but not because of their comments. It's flawed because you should never use SHA or MD5 or similar for passwords. They're designed to be fast, which is not what you want.

SHA-256: You're using the entirely wrong tool for the job. Use password_hash() and password_verify():


How to safely store a password
Cryptography terms explained for non-experts

Additionally, SHA-256 is vulnerable to length-extension attacks.
Using == to compare hashes has two vulnerabilities:


Timing attacks
Magic hash comparison (the more pressing concern)


So, to answer your question: Not very. The problem your code is trying to solve is well-known among security experts, and they've gone out of their way to make it simple for others to solve it. That's why password_hash()and password_verify() exist. Use them.
That said, welcome to software security. If you need some additional resources to aid your self-education, check out this application security reading list on Github.

"50321301","How To Hash Social Security Numbers When Used As Identifiers","I have a service that let's users store information (such as messages, videos', etc.) for their extended family online to be shared when they pass away. Ex - Send this video to my nephew when I pass way telling him I love him. 
I have a JSON structured database that stores a users social security number as an identifier to their profile. 
 $salted_hashed_ssn: {
    //important information for extended family such as vidoes and email addresses
   }

When a user dies, their closest family members go to my site and input the deceased person's social security number. I then hash those and see if a match is made in my database. If a match is made, we then run functions to share the important information for the extended family. 
Preparing for the worst, I want to store the social security numbers as securely as possible. Because I only need to use the social security numbers as a identifier, I don't have to store the raw/plain text ssn values. Therefore, I can hash the ssns but I need to salt them to protect against lookup tables. My issue is that when the users input the deceased user's social security number I don't have a way to see which salt key was used. 
To make it random and prevent against lookup tables, how would you recommend I salt my social security numbers? Should I just take x number of characters each time? Ie - always grab the first 4 characters of the social security number, hash those, and them to the full SSN and then rehash?
let salted_hashed_ssn = SHA256(First 4 characters of SSN) + SHA256(SSN) ?
How would you recommend setting up the salt and hash?
","You can treat your SSN in the same way you would treat a password.  Remember, a salt doesn't have to be secret, it just has to be different for each entry.  So simply store your salt alongside your hash, this is perfectly safe.
I wouldn't recommend using SHA256 here, however.  Use bcrypt instead.  It handles the salt for you, which means you don't need to worry about the advice above anyway.  It's also far more resistant to brute forcing.  The SHA family was not designed for hashing in the way you are using it.

","Here are some examples:

$strr = utf8_encode($str); // Will output 'Ã©Ã³Ã¹Ã¹Ã©Ã©Ã©Ã©Ã¨'

If you apply to an UTF-8 string, utf8_encode() will return a garbled UTF-8 output as shown in the example.
To ensure that you are using UTF-8, at the top of every script use mb_internal_encoding('UTF-8') and you can use this forceutf8 class.
<?php
    // Tell PHP that we're using UTF-8 strings until the end of the script
    mb_internal_encoding('UTF-8');

    include('Encoding.php'); // The class from GitHub

    // Same strings
    $str = 'éóùùééééè';
    $str1 = 'Ã©Ã³Ã¹Ã¹Ã©Ã©Ã©Ã©Ã¨'; //garbled UTF8 of éóùùééééè

    // Force input to UTF-8
    use \ForceUTF8\Encoding;
    echo Encoding::fixUTF8($str).'</br>'; // Will output éóùùééééè
    echo Encoding::fixUTF8($str1).'</br>'; // Will output éóùùééééè

    $str3 = Encoding::fixUTF8($str);
    $str4 = Encoding::fixUTF8($str1);


    // Then hash
    $hash1 = hash('sha256', $str3);
    $hash1 = hash('sha256', $str4);

    echo $hash1; // Will output 45b8151559a5136d58f85ebf51c24f26c47e51f4a89fe2962c8626e99ad64786

I found the answer here where Gerben Rampaart had noticed the same thing on different online sha256-calculators and ken2k knew what the difference was
Once I had done that SHA256.TransformFinalBlock()worked like a charm.
The final solution looks something like this:
public byte[] GetDocumentHash(XmlDocument doc)
{
    string formattedXml;
    Transform canonicalTransform = new XmlDsigExcC14NWithCommentsTransform();
    canonicalTransform.LoadInput(doc);

    using (var xmlTextWriter = XmlWriter.Create(stringWriter, new XmlWriterSettings { NewLineChars = ""\n"", CloseOutput = false, Encoding = Encoding.UTF8, Indent = true, OmitXmlDeclaration = true }))
    {
        XmlDocument newDoc = new XmlDocument();
        newDoc.Load(canonicalStream);
        newDoc.WriteTo(xmlTextWriter);
        xmlTextWriter.Flush();
        formattedXml = stringWriter.GetStringBuilder().ToString();
    }

    byte[] bytesToCalculate = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(formattedXml);

    using (var sha256 = SHA256.Create())
    {
        byte[] shaBytes = new byte[bytesToCalculate.Length];
        bytesToCalculate.CopyTo(shaBytes, 0);

        sha256.TransformFinalBlock(shaBytes, 0, shaBytes.Length);
        return sha256.Hash;

-86, 44, 95, 84, 3, 50, 7, -119, -36, 46, 39, 32, -120, 7, 10, -86, -101, 110, -93, -72, -13, -93, -42, 111, 0, 59, -85, -63, -15, -98, -17, -52
when converted that translates to
170,44,95,84,3,50,7,137,220,46,39,32,136,7,10,170,155,110,163,184,243,163,214,111,0,59,171,193,241,158,239,204
while the C# code returns 
72,108,14,47,15,200,209,10,68,87,17,220,67,226,162,123,69,186,130,167,239,250,180,178,75,101,39,195,32,171,156,178

","Solved.
I problem was with init of stream, I inited a new stream by name, but it doesnt work this way.
I found, that if I go throught all files selected with filepicker, I would use object returned from filepicker.

","Finally, I resolved the problem by creating my own SSL factory like this:
package com.bbpos.www.payment_gp.webservice; 

public class NoSSLv3SocketFactory extends SSLSocketFactory {
private final SSLSocketFactory delegate;

public NoSSLv3SocketFactory() {
    this.delegate = HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultSSLSocketFactory();

public NoSSLv3SocketFactory(SSLSocketFactory delegate) {
    this.delegate = delegate;
}

@Override
public String[] getDefaultCipherSuites() {
    return delegate.getDefaultCipherSuites();

@Override
public String[] getSupportedCipherSuites() {
    return delegate.getSupportedCipherSuites();
}

private Socket makeSocketSafe(Socket socket) {
    if (socket instanceof SSLSocket) {
        String[] protocols = {
                ""TLSv1.1"",
                ""TLSv1.2""
        };
        ((SSLSocket) socket).setEnabledProtocols(protocols);
    }
    return socket;
}

@Override
public Socket createSocket(Socket s, String host, int port, boolean autoClose) throws IOException {
    return makeSocketSafe(delegate.createSocket(s, host, port, autoClose));
}

@Override
public Socket createSocket(String host, int port) throws IOException {
    return makeSocketSafe(delegate.createSocket(host, port));
}

@Override
public Socket createSocket(String host, int port, InetAddress localHost, int localPort) throws IOException {
    return makeSocketSafe(delegate.createSocket(host, port, localHost, localPort));
}

@Override
public Socket createSocket(InetAddress host, int port) throws IOException {
    return makeSocketSafe(delegate.createSocket(host, port));
}

@Override
public Socket createSocket(InetAddress address, int port, InetAddress localAddress, int localPort) throws IOException {
    return makeSocketSafe(delegate.createSocket(address, port, localAddress, localPort));
}

}

And then initialize the factory at beginning of program:
TrustManager[] trustAllCerts = new TrustManager[]{new X509TrustManager() {

        public java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
            return new java.security.cert.X509Certificate[0];

"19474389","RSA Signature Verification with No Certificate JavaScript","Sorry if this question is horribly formatted, this is the first time I've asked one on this site...
So, currently, I am working on a JavaScript extension for Chrome that is supposed to verify an RSA signature without using a certificate.  And I just cannot, for the life of me, figure out what is going wrong! I've looked for hours for some answers or alternative methods but couldn't find anything that worked specifically for my code.  Here is my code so far to clarify my issue:
Signature generating function
function sign(sk, m, certname) {

    var key = new RSAKey();

    key.setPrivate(sk.n, sk.e, sk.d);

    var h = CryptoJS.SHA256(JSON.stringify(m)).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);

    h = new BigInteger(h, 16);

    var sig = key.doPrivate(h).toString(16);

    var obj = { ""type"": ""SIGNED"", ""msg"": m, ""certname"": certname, ""sig"": sig };

    return JSON.stringify(obj);

}

Verification
function verify(pk, signed) {

var key = new RSAKey();
var s = JSON.stringify(signed.sig).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
s = parseInt(s, 16);
var e = JSON.stringify(pk.e).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
log(e);
var n = JSON.stringify(pk.n).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
log(n);
var v = Math.pow(s, e) % n;
var hash = CryptoJS.SHA256(signed.msg).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
log(v);
log(hash);
return (v == hash);

}

In the log, v is, for some reason, always has the value infinity.  Am I using the wrong technique?  Is there a way for my current function to be fixed or is it completely wrong?
Update:
I tried changing the code to:
function verify(pk, signed) {

var key = new RSAKey();
var s = JSON.stringify(signed.sig).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
s = new BigInteger(s, 16);
log(""s:  "" + s);
var e = JSON.stringify(pk.e).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
e = new BigInteger(e, 2);
log(""e:  "" + e);
var n = JSON.stringify(pk.n).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
n = new BigInteger(n, 16);
log(""n:  "" + n);
key.setPublic(n, e);
var v = key.doPublic(s).toString(16);
log(""v:  "" + v);
var hash = CryptoJS.SHA256(JSON.stringify(signed.msg)).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
log(""hash:  "" + hash);
return (v == hash);
}

I know the values I'm giving should result in a pass but now the logs are saying v = 1 whereas hash is (I would assume) what it should be.
","I figured it out, I was parsing the n and e values to a wrong type.  The working code was:
function verify(pk, signed) {

var key = new RSAKey();
var s = JSON.stringify(signed.sig).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
s = new BigInteger(s, 16);
log(""s:  "" + s);
key.setPublic(pk.n, pk.e);
var v = key.doPublic(s).toString(16);
log(""v:  "" + v);
var hash = CryptoJS.SHA256(JSON.stringify(signed.msg)).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
log(""hash:  "" + hash);
return (v == hash);

byte[] d = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(""aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"");
byte[] r = new byte[32];
IntPtr x = NOpenSSL.Wrapper.SHA256(d, d.Length, ref r);
Console.WriteLine(d.Length + "" "" + x + "" "" + r.Length + "" "" + Encoding.ASCII.GetString(r));

And what i get for result: 16 1838788744 1. The d.Length is 16 OK, I get the x as a pointer OK, the r.Length becomes 1 byte that is impossible.
If I don't ref the byte[] in the method just simply give it to it nothing changes in the variable r.
Can anyone help me please what am i doing wrong?
Thank you for the help in advance!
","After some dicovery of the OpenSSL C source and experimenting with C# pointers and Marshaling it turned out the SHA256 method does not put the result hash in the variable md, but it returns a pointer to the hash. (First i thought it's the pointer of the SHA256-struct, but it is the actual hash.)
The working C# code is the following:
[DllImport(DLLNAME, CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
public extern static IntPtr SHA256(byte[] data, long len, byte[] result);

-
byte[] data = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(""some_data_to_hash"");

IntPtr r = NOpenSSL.Wrapper.SHA256(data, data.Length, null);
byte[] output = new byte[32];
Marshal.Copy(r, output, 0, output.Length);

// output contains now the 32 bytes of the hashed data

Since we are not using the 3rd variable of the SHA256 method (we just pass null instead) the ref is needed to be removed from the DllImport.
(Note: https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/crypto/sha.html says: If md is NULL, the digest is placed in a static array. Note: setting md to NULL is not thread safe.)
Using SHA512 is exactly the same just we need to replace the method name at both places in the code and change the output byte[] length from 32 to 64.

Setting this parameter to scram-sha-256 will encrypt the password with SCRAM-SHA-256.

The build log reads.

Add SCRAM-SHA-256 support for password negotiation and storage (Michael Paquier, Heikki Linnakangas) This proves better security than the existing md5 negotiation and storage method.

","It's a compile-time variable in scram-common.h known as SCRAM_ITERATIONS_DEFAULT. Currently it's set to 4096.
That's substantially under the specs ""rule of thumb"" which is cited in Nov 2015 as being 15,000. It's currently the lowest value for permissible iterations. From RFC-7677

The strength of this mechanism is dependent in part on the hash
     iteration-count, as denoted by ""i"" in [RFC5802].  As a rule of thumb,
     the hash iteration-count should be such that a modern machine will
     take 0.1 seconds to perform the complete algorithm; however, this is
     unlikely to be practical on mobile devices and other relatively low-
     performance systems.  At the time this was written, the rule of thumb
     gives around 15,000 iterations required; however, a hash iteration-
     count of 4096 takes around 0.5 seconds on current mobile handsets.
     This computational cost can be avoided by caching the ClientKey
     (assuming the Salt and hash iteration-count is stable).  Therefore,
     the recommendation of this specification is that the hash iteration-
     count SHOULD be at least 4096, but careful consideration ought to be
     given to using a significantly higher value, particularly where
     mobile use is less important.

I however need to sign someting using HMAC-SHA256-128, which is HmacSHA256 but truncated to 128 bits.

This is all good, except that I need a 128-bit result, which I know is
FF365893D899291C3BF505FB3175E880

I have no idea how they reached this result. What I do know is that the HMAC algorithm used is HmacSHA256-128. From what I understand this algorithm will generate a 256-bit result, question is, how do I truncate this into a 128-bits result, returning the known result above?
","The following line always adds 3 characters to the string, starting with '1'. The commented substring(1) removes the 1. It is used so that single character results get a zero pre-pended.
result += Integer.toString((element & 0xff) + 0x100, 16);//.substring(1);

However, even when you fix this, the result does not contain the truncated result you are expecting.
05cd81829e26f44089fd91a9cfbc75db3e067c221323c3ab563f442c68d73278

This of course depends on the value of bgcSecretKey.
You need to use the same key/algorithm/truncation you used to derive the expected result.

","This is poorly documented — I had to download the Artifactory OSS source code and grep for the answer — but apparently Path Checksum migration is a completely separate job from SHA-256 migration. 
You want artifactory.pathChecksum.migration.job.enabled=true in your artifactory.system.properties, I think.

"46197644","Android SHA256 signature algorythm with certificate having a SHA1 algorythm","My question is somewhat a follow up of this one: Can I specify digest algorithm apksigner uses? 
I'm signign an APK with apksigner and following reccomandations on above post, I raised the minSDK to 18+. As expected the resulting MANIFEST.MF and ANDROID.SF digest report SHA-256 digest hashes for the files in the packages instead of SHA-1 digest hashes.
Android-minSDK18.SF excerpt

Android-minSDK16.SF excerpt

However printing the .RSA certificate with keytool -printcert -file ""ANDROID - minSDK18.RSA"" or keytool -printcert -file ""ANDROID - minSDK16.RSA"" gives the same result specifing a SHA1withRSA Signature algorythm.

That is probably because SHA1withRSA is the Signature algorythm embedded in the certificate:

My question is to know if the signature algorythm of the certifiicate used to sign an APK has an impact related to the SHA-1 collision problems even when the APK is signed with SHA-256 algorythm.
","No, the signature algorithm inside the app signing certificate -- the algorithm used by certificate Issuer to sign the certificate -- has no impact on the security of your Android app. The reason is that Android does not verify this cryptographic signature inside the app signing certificate.
For more background, all that matters to Android in an app signing certificate is that:

it parses,
it declares that its public key can be used for digital signatures,
(only when updating an already installed app) it is identical to the app signing certificate of the currently installed version of the app.

Completes the hash computation by performing final operations such as padding. The digest is reset after this call is made.

Call digest() once and put the results into a variable.

Thanks in advance!
","dwFlags needs to be SIGNER_TIMESTAMP_RFC3161 (2).  The reason you get an access violation is that SignerTimeStampEx2() is documented incorrectly.  It expects the algorithm as a PCSTR rather than a DWORD.  If you pass 0x800C it'll try to dereference that as a pointer, leading to the AV.  So replace ALG_ID dwAlgId in the function declaration with PCSTR pszTimeStampAlgorithmOid.  Pass szOID_NIST_sha256 to it, which should be defined as ""2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1"".
SignerTimeStampEx3() is also incorrectly incorrectly documented.  pszTimeStampAlgorithmOid should be declared as PCSTR rather than as PCWSTR.
In my experience, code signing and time stamping are more reliable if you specify both the file name and an open Win32 file handle in the SIGNER_FILE_INFO structure.
Whether you will actually get an SHA-256 time stamp also depends on the time stamping service you're using.  http://tsa.starfieldtech.com, http://timestamp.globalsign.com/ and http://timestamp.comodoca.com/rfc3161 issue SHA-256 timestamps.  Other services may issue SHA-1 time stamps even when requesting an SHA-256 time stamp.

"34651542","Calculating SHA256 hash with OpenSSL in FIPS mode","The background
I've compiled OpenSSL with the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module (following the instructions for cross compiling to Android).
Now in my code I want to use SHA256 (from what I can see at least some sha256 algorithms are FIPS approved).
The problem
After calling set_mode(1) to enable FIPS in runtime, the following code crashes in OpenSSLDie (presumably means disabled by FIPS)
SHA256_CTX sha256;
SHA256_Init(&sha256);
SHA256_Update(&sha256, data, len);
SHA256_Final(outputBuffer, &sha256);

The questions 

It seems that calling private_SHA256_Init instead works, but is it the correct way or does it circumvent the FIPS compliance?
If it isn't the correct way how can I calculate SHA256 in FIPS mode?
Since usage of non-approved algorithms is allowed if not for cryptography (by FIPS-140.2), would calling the private function be good then (for example to calculate SHA1, which seems out of the question at all in FIPS mode, but it's not to be used for crypto)

More info
versions used: openssl-1.0.1q, openssl-fips-2.0.11
","Usage of low-level functions such as SHA256_Init is deprecated, as far as I know.
Currently approved method for calculating digests using OpenSSL is via EVP. An example for SHA-256, taken from https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/EVP_Message_Digests :
void digest_message(unsigned char *message, unsigned char **digest, unsigned int *digest_len)
{
    EVP_MD_CTX *mdctx;

Well, technically, they are both SHA256, it's just the input the differs. When doing SHA256, you hash the data itself. When doing ""salted"" (doesn't matter which hash function you use), you first add some ""salt"" to the input (addition could be different, but most often it's just concatenation; ""suffix"" hints that the salt is added after the input), and then hash the resulting data.

Solution to your question/problem:
string hash = hash.ComputeHash(""your string"");

Or if server provide salt string for you:
byte[] salt = ASCIIEncoding.UTF8.GetBytes(""server salt string in plaintext"");
string hash = hash.ComputeHash(""your string to hash"", salt);

then return hash to the server.

These are mostly personal records, tied together by SSN (well, not really SSN but something very similar). For security reasons, we are not storing the SSN, but rather the SHA2-256 hash of the SSN.
On MySql 5.6, I can simply use the built-in function:
sha2( string, 256).

For MS SQL Express (SQL Server 2008 running on Windows 7) I used this link (http://geekswithblogs.net/hroggero/archive/2009/09/19/strong-password-hashing-with-sql-server.aspx) to write an external UDF.
Each function should return the same string for the same argument .. and it does not. Even more puzzling is that the binary representation seems to be quite different:
MySql Output:   bfd6b995588ec54ce16871bc82a7ac86dd43a2c22309ea68e479a50043683937

The MSSQL output is clearly a hex encoding (0-9, A-F) of the low and high 4 bit portions of each byte. But how does MySql represent the binary characters?
Ran the MySql queries both through SqlYog and through the DOS command-line ... no difference. 
I have checked the MySql documentation and everything else I could find on the web, no luck.

","For bitwise shift left:
`x << n` is the same as `x *= 2^n`  

To see the overflowing bit (MSB):
    x / (2^32) >= 1 //Since we are using an 32 bit int

Likewise, for bitwise shift right:
`x >> n` is the same as `x /= 2^n`  

To see the overflowing bit (LSB):
    x % 2
Append the overflowing bit to the adjacent int by adding or subtracting set values. You should really use a BigInteger like I mentioned in my comment, anything else will require an implementation where you read and append the bits moving between array locations yourself.

","The JWT from the WSO2 API Gateway does not follow the specification (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519).
All the samples I have seen are of the form:
<Base64lEncodedHeader>.<Base64EncodedPayload>.<OPTIONAL, Base64EncodedSignature>

but should be:
<Base64UrlEncodedHeader>.<Base64UrlEncodedPayload>.<OPTIONAL, Base64UrlEncodedSignature>

The problem is the use of Base64 instead of Base64Url encoding.  Since the signature is based on <Base64EncodedHeader>.<Base64EncodedPayload>, and the MS JWT framework is validating the signature against the expected <Base64UrlEncodedHeader>.<Base64UrlEncodedPayload>, it will always fail validation.  I had to write my own custom signature verification code to work around this problem.  Then I strip off the signature from the token prior to parsing and decoding with JwtSecurityTokenHandler.
Here is the final code:
try
{
    // Get data and signature from unaltered token
    var data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(token.Split('.')[0] + '.' + token.Split('.')[1]);
    var signature = Convert.FromBase64String(token.Split('.')[2]);

    // Get certificate from file
    var x509 = new X509Certificate2(HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath(""~/App_Data/"" + ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""CertFileName""]));

    // Verify the data with the signature
    var csp = (RSACryptoServiceProvider)x509.PublicKey.Key;
    if (!csp.VerifyData(data, ""SHA256"", signature))
    {
        // Signature verification failed; data was possibly altered
        throw new SecurityTokenValidationException(""Data signature verification failed. Token cannot be trusted!"");
    }

    // strip off signature from token
    token = token.Substring(0, token.LastIndexOf('.') + 1);

    // Convert Base64 encoded token to Base64Url encoding
    token = token.Replace('+', '-').Replace('/', '_').Replace(""="", """");

    // Use JwtSecurityTokenHandler to validate the JWT token
    var tokenHandler = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler();

    // Read the JWT
    var parsedJwt = tokenHandler.ReadToken(token);

    // Set the expected properties of the JWT token in the TokenValidationParameters
    var validationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters()
    {
        NameClaimType = ""http://wso2.org/claims/enduser"",

    };

","Quick example using the library found by David Berger:
https://github.com/emn178/js-sha256/blob/master/src/sha256.js
(downloading file from the web, then computing the hash).
Probably it would be wiser to use an external REST service to compute the hash (maybe with https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/integrating/call-out, but headers are missing?)
Edit: It works only using playground (client side), see Function in logic.js works in playground but not in REST server, right still learning... Maybe I should try with https://www.npmjs.com/package/request... or my own external REST service.
/**
* This part will only work on playground. Should try with
* @param {String} documentUrl 
*/
function getContent(documentUrl)
{
    return fetch(documentUrl, {
        method: 'GET'
    }).then((response) => {
        return response.text()
        .then((text) => {
          return text;
        });
     });
}

/**

 */
function generateHash(documentUrl)
{
    return getContent(documentUrl)
    .then((documentContent) => {
        let hash = sha256.create();
        hash.update(documentContent);
        return hash.hex();
    });
}

So, case closed, but it was - I must admit - an easy one. Now I'm facing more complicated problems calling external rest APIs using Http, rest endpoints instead of using wrappers... The good point: the code will be stripped of unnecessary stuff. Still, the learning curve of hyperleder composer is far less steep than hyperledger fabric alone. Great tool!

There hmac is getting generated considering key as hexkey . So obviously hmac generated is different.
How do i tell the CCMac function in objective C to consider the key as hex key? I already tried converting the string key to byte array and passing it to CCMAC but still didn't work.
In android I have achieved the same by converting the hex number to a Big Integer and then doing getBytes on it, use it to create the secret key.

and a few other posts about the deprecation of the SHA1 hash algorithm for certificate signing.
My main question/concern is that the radio that I am using does not support the use of any certificates stronger than SHA1 (no SHA2 support at all) and I wanted to know if EAP-TLS and other 802.1X methods are going to be affected by this shift to SHA2. Will CAs (either the Root CA if the customer created their own or the Intermediate CA, in the case that my customers use a third party Root CA) be able to issue SHA1 certificates still or will that be stopped as well?
I appreciate any help and support regarding this issue.

","The first thing you should do is get the test vectors from the standard and verify if your implementation generates the exact same result. If it does not, it's broken.
You can also generate other test vectors if you have a ""known sane"" implementation (the openssl command probably has one).
Finally, run some performance tests with progressively larger files, and compare with a known fast implementation (the openssl one should be quite fast). If it fails (exausting all memory or being too slow), you have to fix something on it.
If it passes all these tests, it should be good enough. There shouldn't be many security concerns with a hashing algorithm (unless you are hashing sensitive data, where you would have to be very careful to overwrite all the memory you used).

","org.w3c.dom.document.normalizeDocument() document does not alter the order of child elements.
You could do this by a recursive parse of the document. However, consider whether this is more expensive than the operation you're trying to cache in the first place... 
Method 

At each level copy all the nodes to a java.util.List implementation, i.e. ArrayList. This is required because org.w3c.dom.NodeList does not allow modification
Sort the list using Collections.sort()
Remove children from their parent
Add children back in sorted order

Note this does not deal with multiple elements of same name with different contents, but does solve your example
For example:
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Document doc = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance().newDocumentBuilder().parse(new File(""test.xml""));
    sort(doc);

    TransformerFactory tf = TransformerFactory.newInstance();
    Transformer transformer = tf.newTransformer();
    transformer.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.OMIT_XML_DECLARATION, ""yes"");
    StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
    transformer.transform(new DOMSource(doc), new StreamResult(writer));

    System.out.println(writer);
}

private static void sort(Node doc) {
    List<Node> children = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < doc.getChildNodes().getLength(); i++) {
        children.add(doc.getChildNodes().item(i));
    }
    for (Node child : children) {
        doc.removeChild(child);
    }
    Collections.sort(children, (a, b) -> {
        return a.getNodeName().compareTo(b.getNodeName());
    });
    for (Node child : children) {
        doc.appendChild(child);
    }
    for (Node child : children) {
        sort(child);

Usually the process with any type of Hash is that, once it's brought out, it would be the most secure it will ever be, and then gradually over time, with the collection of people and increased computer power, the hash will be ""broken"" usually through a collection of Rainbow tables, and will end up with a website such as THIS which is what happened with Md5.
If you are going to store them in a .txt file, the minimum you can do on top of what you've already done, is to make sure you SALT the hashed password. 
Salting a hashed password decreases its chance of being cracked. Please refer to links below on how you would go about Salting your hash.
Great video by Computerphile on YouTube about the topic

"36444414","Can I store sha256 hashed passwords in plain text?","So I have php code which saves a hashed version of a password to a file called passwords.txt. As it currently stands, anyone who knows the directory of the file (www.example.com/datacache/passwords.txt) can access it. Is this the incorrect way of doing it? I thought I followed the guide to correct password treatment to the letter, but this seems oddly insecure. Thoughts? Suggestions?
Thank you!
","Actually there are two questions here:
1) Is it ok to store the hashes in a file
Saving passwords in a file is not better or worse than storing it in a database. The point with a file is, that it should be stored outside of the WWW root directory. Most providers offer a private directory, which can be accessed by code, but canot be reached for HTTP requests.
2) Is it safe to use SHA-256 for hashing passwords
No SHA-* and MD5 should not be used directly to hash passwords, because they are too fast and therefore can be brute-forced too easily. Instead one should use a slow function like BCrypt, PBKDF2 or SCrypt, they offer a cost factor and add a safe salt automatically.
PHP offers a password API with two functions password_hash() and password_verify(). Use them, they are future proof and will produce BCrypt hashes.
// Hash a new password for storing in the database.
// The function automatically generates a cryptographically safe salt.
$hashToStoreInDb = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);

// Check if the hash of the entered login password, matches the stored hash.
// The salt and the cost factor will be extracted from $existingHashFromDb.
$isPasswordCorrect = password_verify($password, $existingHashFromDb);

If you're running an old version of PHP that doesn't have this API, upgrade. If for some reason you can't, check out password_compat.

"29604301","SHA-256 custom length digest","I need to allow old users of a website to have access to the new website with the same credentials. The database server version is Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and i dont have permissions to make changes to the database. The password column of the database is set to varchar(50) and a digest is 48 characters. The only information that i have for the passwords is that they have been hashed with sha-256 algoritm but as far as i know a sha-256 digest is 64 characters and not 48. Is it possible to produce the same 48 length digests with sha256?
","The only two primitive hash functions with native output size of 192 bits (48hex * 1byte/2hex * 8bit/byte) are HAVAL-192 and TIGER-192. None of the others match up exactly.
If they have indeed been hashed with sha256, then they may be truncated (as a hex encoded sha-256 digest is 64 characters.
To deduce the exact situation will take some work. Here are the different ways you can approach it.

If I had access to the original source code, I'd look at that. Considering you asked the question, I'll assume that's not possible.
If I could write a record into the old system, I'd set a sentinel password (or find an account I knew the password to). Something that I know. Then I'd find the hashed result from the DB.
So now we know p=password and h=4d9e.... 
From there, start by just hashing the password with sha256 and see what you come up with. If you're lucky, you'll find a pattern quickly (like the last half of the hash is just cut off). If you're not lucky, it'll take some digging and trial and error.
So, for example:
p = ""password""
h = ""5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd6""

The result would be: sha256(p)[0:48] as sha256(p) == ""5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8""
h = ""51d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8""

The result would be: sha256(p)[16:48]
And so on.
If I didn't have access to a known password, there would be no way of testing the hypothesis. So if you don't have the source code, and don't know an account in the system, you're basically out of luck. So make those first 2 your top priority.

Beware that you may have to get creative. It's entirely possible that something weird has been done. Such as:
salt = h[0:8]
tmp = sha256(p + salt)
h = salt + (tmp[0:16] xor tmp[16:16])

So have fun :-)

","You're getting the bytes with [inputString UTF8String] but the length with [inputString lengthOfBytesUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding]. This is obviously wrong. Moreover (assuming you mean ""\xB4"" and that it turns into something not in ASCII), ""\xB4"" is not likely to be in ASCII. The docs for NSString say

Returns 0 if the specified encoding cannot be used to convert the receiver

So you're calculating the hash of the empty string. Of course it's wrong.
You're less likely to have problems if you only generate the data once:

","Just read in the raw POST body and run verify your signature against that. By grabbing the body as JSON and turning it into a string you might be subtly manipulating the response we send you.
Here's how I've done it for a few projects where I've worked with webhooks (in ruby):
class WebhookVerifier
  attr_accessor :expected_hmac, :data
  def initialize(options = {})
    @expected_hmac = options.fetch(:expected_hmac, '')
    content = options.fetch(:content, StringIO.new)
    content.rewind
    @data = content.read

    calculated_hmac = Base64.encode64(OpenSSL::HMAC.digest(digest, ShopifyApp.configuration.secret, data)).strip
    calculated_hmac == expected_hmac

The Shopify docs only contain a Ruby and Php samples, not too hard to translate I thought. Well I seem to be struggling.
Here is my simple Scala shopify util object:
    import play.api.mvc.Request
    import play.api.mvc.AnyContent
    import javax.crypto.Mac
    import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec
    import play.api.Logger
    import javax.crypto.SecretKey
    import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64

    object ShopifyUtils {
        def verifyWebhookCall(request : Request[AnyContent], secretKey: String) : Boolean = {

          if (!request.headers.get(""X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256"").isDefined)
              false
          else
          {
            val headerHash = request.headers.get(""X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256"").getOrElse("""")
            val body = request.body.asJson.get.toString

            Logger.info(""json '"" + request.body.asJson.get.toString + ""' = "" + encode(secretKey, request.body.asJson.get.toString) );
            Logger.info(""body '"" + request.body.toString() + ""' = "" + encode(secretKey, request.body.toString) )

            Logger.info(""headerHash "" + headerHash);

            val calcHash = encode(secretKey, body)
            headerHash.equals(calcHash)
          }
        }

        def encode(key: String , data: String): String = {
          val sha256_HMAC = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA256"");
          val secret_key = new SecretKeySpec(key.getBytes(), ""HmacSHA256"");
          sha256_HMAC.init(secret_key);

          return new String( Base64.encodeBase64( sha256_HMAC.doFinal( data.getBytes ) ) ).trim
        }
    }

The hash I generate is never the same as the one Shopify sends. 
Either my shared secret key is wrong (which I don't see how it can be) or I'm not hashing the same content as Shopify does (I've tried various request.body output formats).
Any tips/guides/suggestions gratefully received.
Tim
","Thanks to csaunders for pointing me in the right direction.
I was using the default BodyParser AnyContent that implicitly converts the response body to json when the Content-type of the request specifies 'application/json'.
I had to modify my controller object to specify the 'raw' BodyParser:
    import play.api._
    import play.api.libs.iteratee.Enumerator
    import play.api.mvc.SimpleResult
    import play.api.mvc.ResponseHeader
    import play.api.libs.json._
    import play.Application
    import play.api.mvc._

    import javax.crypto.Mac
    import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec
    import play.api.Logger
    import javax.crypto.SecretKey
    import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64

    object Purchase extends Controller { 

      val shopifyAppSecretKey = ""11111111111111111111111111111111""

      def processPurchase() = Action( parse.raw ) {request =>

        val bodyRaw = request.body.asBytes(3000).getOrElse(Array[Byte]())
        val calculatedHash = encodeByteArray(shopifyAppSecretKey, bodyRaw)
        val shopifyHash = request.headers.get(""X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256"").getOrElse("""")

        Logger.info(""keys '"" + shopifyHash + ""' || '"" + calculatedHash + ""' "" + calculatedHash.equals(shopifyHash))

        val json: JsValue = Json.parse( new String(bodyRaw) )

        Ok( ""Ok"" ).as(HTML)
      }

      def encodeByteArray(key: String , data: Array[Byte]): String = {
        val sha256_HMAC = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA256"");
        val secret_key = new SecretKeySpec(key.getBytes(), ""HmacSHA256"");
        sha256_HMAC.init(secret_key);

        return new String( Base64.encodeBase64( sha256_HMAC.doFinal( data ) ) ).trim
      }
    }

Using the 'raw' BodyParser means that you have to convert the byte array to a string yourself and then parse that string manually to get your json but thats no real problem.
Now all is working as expected.
Thanks,
Tim

","I have finally found that the version of the openssl version is behind the problem. SHA256 was not supported until 0.9.8o. So I tried upgrading openssl to latest one. As my system is quite old, latest versions are not being supported. 
So I started compiling 0.9.8o successfully but it breaks SSH as is internally used. So my objective now is to upgrade openssl to 0.9.8o without breaking SSH server.
I started digging down a bit and found out ways to link different version of Openssl as was also mentioned by ""Steffen Ullrich"" above. I was able to compile and link with openssl 0.9.8o both statically and dynamically and found below observation.
when we compile php with openssl enabled, curl does not use its linked openssl to connect to the site. Here I had compiled both php as well as curl with separate versions of openssl(I have even tried compiling and linking curl with static openssl). The version of openssl which was compiled with php use to take precedence while connecting to the site and hence fails to connect in my case(due to SHA256 ssl certificate & php-openssl-0.9.7e). 
However, if I recompile php with higher version of openssl(0.9.8o), then it is able to connect.
Also, if I compile php without enabling openssl, then curl is able to connect as it uses its linked openssl 0.9.8o.
I do not know if this is a bug or was meant to be like this in php, or maybe fixed in latest available versions of php/curl. 
But I think from curl's perspective, it is not the correct thing to use the version of openssl linked with php for connecting to the site. It should use its linked openssl version(0.9.8o) for connecting to the site. While if anybody is connecting to the website the version of openssl(0.9.7e) linked to php should be used.

"12866168","Debugging a SHA-256 implementation","I've been working on a SHA-256 implementation using MASM32, and got some source done.  However, I can't get it working correctly and have looked at it, rewrote bits of it, and copied some source into the inline Delphi ASM and got it running perfectly, yet my original ASM source has problems.  Given that I'm not incredibly experienced with it, Would it be possible for someone to look at the source and tell me if they see something I'm missing?  I already did a Delphi implementation and have it working perfectly, so I know it's not the algorithm itself at fault but the ASM code itself.
I was planning on optimizing tasks after I simply got it working.  But bear in mind that I am still learning (self-taught), so if you see something I do that is on the stupid side in this source, I'd like to be able to learn, too.  But my main concern is getting it working since I'm not seeing where the error(s) are.
(Removed the ASM code for space concerns, since I know the problem now)
Edit: I figured out what the problem was.  Which leads into the next logical question since I don't know: Why did this code cause a problem?
Changing the following at the end of the SHA256Loop macro:
ADD  h, ECX  
ADD  h, EBX  ; h := t1 + t2;

To this:
ADD  ECX, EBX  ; h := t1 + t2;
MOV  h, ECX

Fixed it.  Why couldn't I do two ADD instructions to the memory and get the same result as the ADD to register and then a MOV to memory?
","Your first example with two ADD instructions depends on the previous contents of h. The second example is independent of the previous contents of h. If the value of h is not guaranteed to be zero, then those two examples will behave differently.

Actually my client's need is following:
""MPEG video

<video file><metadata><metadata_offset(i8)><type(i4)>

The first 2^21 bytes of the file will be xor-ed with the following pattern.  SHA-256 (512-bit mode) is used to make a 2^11 byte pattern.  The first SHA call will be made on “xyzzy” + the FB username + the UUID of the video + “@a2+;%d3-“ .  
The following calls will use the output of the previous stage plus two ASCII bytes representing a counter that starts at 1 and goes to 2^5.  The pattern is then xor-ed across the file 2^10 times.
The type is a four byte integer in network byte order.  It has to be zero for this release.""

The client was Android app and its encryption method was wrote in Java, the server`s was wrote in C.
I call the session key as ""magic token"", and the magic token is generated by PBKDF2 algorithm with 1000 iterations of SHA256 hash on server. The client fetch the magic token from server and the client itself needs to regenerate the magic token again in order to compare the fetched one and generated one. if they are equal, means the session key is valid and the client can go further operations. 
But my problem is when I trying to generate the magic token using the same algorithm, salt, iteration count with server side, the generated hash value are not the same. Maybe it caused by PBKDF2 algorithm or sha256 are not exactly same for different platforms. I feel really confused and anyone can help me find out where the error comes from?

","Our installers were suffering from the same issue. Even when I only SHA-2-signed using an SHA-2 certificate, Edge still reported the signature to be invalid.
We were using the same code signing authority, ""VeriSign Class 3 Code Signing 2010 CA"", which itself is signed using an SHA-1 signature:

This seems to be the cause of SmartScreen's ""The signature of this file is corrupt or invalid"" error message.
I contacted Symantec (they run VeriSign now) and they issued a replacement certificate for us. Unlike the previous one, the one is signed by ""Symantec Class 3 SHA256 Code Signing CA"" and executables signed with in no longer trigger the ""signature corrupt or invalid"" error in SmartScreen.

I still get a warning because our installers don't have enough reputation yet, but that's a completely different issue.

","To anyone who is working on implementing EET (in Czech Republic). I did not found a solution using Web reference.
But there is an Apache licenced library on Github:

"38416392","How do you timestamp a sha256 certificate with a sha256 signature to secure Excel VBA Macro code in Excel 2013?","This quote was taken from an answer to another question about Excel Security settings. The answer proposed using a digital certificate to sign macros to resolve the security issue. Towards the end of the answer, it was noted that:
""When you digitally sign macros, it is important to obtain a time stamp. . .""
This is tricky in Office 2013, for a variety of reasons. First, there are two different ways to attach a signature to a spreadsheet. They are known as visible and invisible signatures. The visible signatures can be applied to the whole document using the File > Protect Workbook > Add a digital signature commands. To apply an invisible one to the VBA code alone, from the VBA editor, use the Tools > Digital Signature commands then Choose a certificate to sign with. 
It would be preferable to simply protect the VBA code and not the entire spreadsheet, because as soon as you run the macro, the code writes its output into the spreadsheet, and since it's a protected workbook, the code errors out and comes to a halt. This workbook was designed as a demonstration and was saved with a read only recommendation and requires a password to modify it. We want the user to be able to have the macro write to the spreadsheet, but not to save the file with changes under the same name. Since applying a digital signature to the VBA only protects the VBA, when it writes to the spreadsheet, there is no error.
The problem is obtaining a timestamp on the certificate protecting the VBA. 
There are a bewildering array of registry and group policy settings that affect timestamping, and it's quite unclear which settings are required to obtain a sha256 timestamp on my sha256 certificate when used to only protect the VBA. I've tried everything available that looks as though it could affect timestamping without joy.
While I've been able to sign spreadsheets and get that signature timestamped using the newer Office XAdES counter signature, the certificate used to sign the VBA project is not timestamped itself. 
Entries it the following registry key are required:
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\Signatures
I believe the following values in the key only affect timestamping the whole workbook XAdES signature.
MinXAdESLevel DWORD 2
TSALocation http://timestamp.comodoca.com/rfc3161
XAdESLevel DWORD 5
From experimenting, I have found that it was possible to get the cert protecting the VBA countersigned with a timestamp by using the following registry entries:
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\VBA\Security:
TimeStampURL http://timestamp.comodoca.com/rfc3161
TimeStampRetryCount DWORD 2
TimeStampRetryDelay DWORD 5
Unfortunately, I was only able to obtain a SHA1 timestamp when doing it this way. Soon, that will be like having no timestamp at all on Windows 10. 
Does anyone know how to get a SHA256 timestamp in this situation?
","By default, Office does not use a timestamping service when signing or validating code. Using a timestamping service usually takes more time than the default digital signing process. To use a timestamping service, Office needs to communicate with a certificate authority s timestamp server over the Internet to complete the action. You cannot timestamp a digital signature unless you are connected to the Internet.
There is no built-in Office user interface to use this option. To have Office use a timestamping service with all future digital signatures, you need to set these registry keys.
The values should be entered under ONE key. Please use the following instructions:
Create a Security key at the VBA level:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VBA\Security
Add a String value Item to the Security key named TimeStampURL with the value set to the time stamp URL below.
The SHA-1 timestamping URL is timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll
The timstamp.dll filename is required to conform to old MS-DOS naming convention).
The SHA-1 with RFC 3161 timestamping URL is http://sha1timestamp.ws.symantec.com/sha1/timestamp
The SHA-256 with RFC 3161 timestamping URL is http://sha256timestamp.ws.symantec.com/sha256/timestamp
Add a DWORD value item to the Security key named TimeStampRetryCount with the value data set to '3' (In my case I used 3 but you can pick a different number)
Add a DWORD value item to the Security key named TimeStampRetryDelay with the value data set to '3' (In my case I used 3 but you can pick a different number).
To reduce the likelihood that a malicious user can derive a digital certificate's private key from its public key, a commercially obtained digital certificate expires after one year. Office will not allow you to use an expired certificate to sign macros, and will also warn the end user when a digital signature for a file has expired. The end user will see a warning in the usual Digital Signature security warning, which indicates that the certificate is no longer trustworthy. The user can determine if the certificate has expired by looking in the Details dialog box for the certificate.
To prevent you from having to resign your software and Visual Basic for Applications projects every time your certificate expires, some commercial certificate authorities provide a timestamping service. If you use a timestamping service when signing code, a hash of your code is sent to a server to record a timestamp for your code. When using a timestamping service, a user's software can distinguish between code signed with an expired certificate that should not be trusted, and code that was signed with a certificate that was valid at the time the code was signed, but which has subsequently expired.

"49831860","Signing a message with hmac and sha256 in dart","I try to generate a sha256 HMAC using a base64-decoded secret key on a message. I would like to use the dart language. In python, I could do it with the following code:
# PYTHON CODE
import hmac, hashlib, base64
...
message = 'blabla'
secret = 'DfeRt[...]=='
secret_b64 = base64.b64decode(secret)
signature = hmac.new(secret_b64, message, hashlib.sha256)
signature_b64 = signature.digest().encode('base64').rstrip('\n')

Here is what I tried with dart:
// DART CODE
import 'package:crypto/crypto.dart';
import 'dart:convert';
...
String message = 'blabla';
String secret = 'DfeRt[...]=='
var secret_b64 = BASE64.decode(secret);
var hmac = new Hmac(sha256, secret_b64);
// what now?

But then I don't know how to go on. I found some old example code which looks like the following
var message_byte = UTF8.encode(message);
hmac.add(message_byte);

However, the method ""add"" does not exist any more in the Hmac class. I also tried this, but I am not sure if this is correct
var message_byte = UTF8.encode(message);    
var signature = hmac.convert(message_byte);
var signature_b64 = BASE64.encode(signature.bytes);

Can someone help me out?
","If you have the whole 'message' available then just call convert(). If the message is large or in pieces then deal with it in chunks.
Your example is simple, when spelled out step by step.
  String base64Key = 'DfeRt...';
  String message = 'blabla';

  List<int> messageBytes = utf8.encode(message);
  List<int> key = base64.decode(base64Key);
  Hmac hmac = new Hmac(sha256, key);
  Digest digest = hmac.convert(messageBytes);

  String base64Mac = base64.encode(digest.bytes);

Please read the Effective Dart guide. Note how constants are now lower case, variables in Dart use camel case, etc

Anyone would tell the detail implementation, thx
","Per the Meteor docs, accounts-password uses bcrypt.
If you look at the source code of loginWithPassword, you should be able to find out where the salt is stored.  As a second source, read MasterAM's answer to Laravel & Meteor password hashing which indicates that Meteor from 2011 on uses $2y$ hash strings, i.e. PHP CRYPT_BLOWFISH, which uses

CRYPT_BLOWFISH - Blowfish hashing with a salt as follows: ""$2a$"", ""$2x$"" or ""$2y$"", a two digit cost parameter, ""$"", and 22 characters from the alphabet ""./0-9A-Za-z"". Using characters outside of this range in the salt will cause crypt() to return a zero-length string. The two digit cost parameter is the base-2 logarithm of the iteration count for the underlying Blowfish-based hashing algorithmeter and must be in range 04-31, values outside this range will cause crypt() to fail. Versions of PHP before 5.3.7 only support ""$2a$"" as the salt prefix: PHP 5.3.7 introduced the new prefixes to fix a security weakness in the Blowfish implementation. Please refer to » this document for full details of the security fix, but to summarise, developers targeting only PHP 5.3.7 and later should use ""$2y$"" in preference to ""$2a$"". 

Thus, look for the $2y$ string in the database, and extract the salt from it.

","You are correct, your hello_file has a newline:
$ echo 'hello' > hello_file; openssl sha256 hello_file; xxd hello_file
SHA256(hello_file)= 5891b5b522d5df086d0ff0b110fbd9d21bb4fc7163af34d08286a2e846f6be03
0000000: 6865 6c6c 6f0a                           hello.

Removing the new line would depend on your editor, if your situation is similar to mine when i found this post, messing with a hash of a password you can just do something like this:
$ echo -n 'hello' > hello_file; openssl sha256 hello_file; xxd hello_file
SHA256(hello_file)= 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824
0000000: 6865 6c6c 6f                             hello

You can do something like this to remove the last character(or two):
$ echo ""hello"" > hello_file; od -c hello_file; truncate hello_file --size=-1; od -c hello_file
0000000   h   e   l   l   o  \n
0000006
0000000   h   e   l   l   o
0000005

It looks as if the other calculators are appending a dos style carriage return + new line
$ echo -en 'hello\r\n' > hello_file; openssl sha256 hello_file; xxd hello_file

","The documentation just wants you to use the request body, the query string on the url, and the client secret together in one string (the query string and request body are concatenated together, and then the client secret is prepended with a | character).
You can use a prepared request; this gives you access to the query string and request body before sending:
import requests
import hashlib
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def calculate_signature(secret, data=None, params=None):
    # the actual URL doesn't matter as this request is never sent.
    request = requests.Request('POST', 'http://example.com',
                               data=data, params=params)
    prepped = request.prepare()
    query_string = urlparse(prepped.url).query
    # neither the URL nor the body are encoded to bytes yet
    total_params = query_string + prepped.body
    return hashlib.sha256('{}|{}'.format(secret, total_params).encode('ASCII')).hexdigest()

MY_API_KEY = 'XXX'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'XXX'

headers = {
    'X-MBX-APIKEY': MY_API_KEY,
}

data = [
  ('symbol', 'LTCBTC'),
  ('side', 'BUY'),
  ('type', 'LIMIT'),
  ('timeInForce', 'GTC'),

  ('price', '0.1'),
  ('recvWindow', '6000000'),

]

data.append(
    ('signature', calculate_signature(CLIENT_SECRET, data=data)))

response = requests.post('https://www.binance.com/api/v1/order', data=data, headers=headers)

The prepared request object was only used to give you the request body to sign. Their API is a little convoluted in that they then expect you to append the signature to the request body itself rather than in a header (which is what most REST APIs do).
The calculate_signature() function produces the same results as the documentation:

Please suggest any other method which I can implement in iOS to produces the same output as received in android.
","Your Android code and your iOS code is not equivalent. 
Your Android code simply computes the SHA256 digest of your key value concatenation with your message. 
You are first calling update with your key and then calling digest with your messsge. The documentation states:

Performs a final update on the digest using the specified array of bytes, then completes the digest computation. That is, this method first calls update(input), passing the input array to the update method, then calls digest().

Your iOS code, on the other hand, is computing a HMAC of your message using the supplied key.  This is not the same thing. 
You need to compute the SHA256 in the same way that you do on Android;

Use CC_SHA256_Init
call CC_SHA256_Update with your key and message
Call CC_SHA256_Final to get the hash

Probably easier in Swift is to use SwiftyRSA. All you need to do then is create an instance of ClearMessage initialised with your concatenation key and message and then call the digest function on it.

","You're opening a JPEG (i.e. a binary file) and then reading every line of text from it. Don't do that. Any time you treat binary data as text, you're just asking for odd behaviour.
I don't know much about Ruby at all, but I'd generally expect to open the file, and repeatedly read chunks of binary data from it, updating the hash with that. Don't do anything which talks about ""lines"" or uses text at all.

","The BigInteger conversion is ignoring leading zeros in your SHA-256 hash. Instead you should encode byte[] directly. As suggested in this answer you can use String.format():
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
for (byte b : shaSum) {
    sb.append(String.format(""%02X"", b));
}
return sb.toString();

When encoded as hex string the SHA-256 value has 64 characters, as per wiki example:

Trying to debug it, it looks likes the implementation of crypt() doesn't reflect the PHP manual, or I've misunderstood it. If I would venture a guess, it's the latter.
I'm using a 16 character long salt as part of a larger salt using SHA256, which is used as the example in the PHP manual.
$password = //string entered at login
$salt = '$5$rounds=250000$1234abcd5678defg$';

After I've hashed the entered password
$hash = crypt($password, $salt);

I get a string like this as the return value:
$5$rounds=250000$1234abcd5678$tI.Oiz.YwWjIwT3K.SLU8SwUZ9J0/odBCkbE6t0igeB

What baffles me is that the 16 character salt, that is part of the larger part (1234abcd5678defg above), now is truncated to 12 characters.
Is this as intended? The crypt() function also seems to return different results now than before - is that usual between versions of PHP? Nothing in the changelog suggest any radical changes to the encryption algorithms.
","This is the response I received from Zend:

","Base32 is a notation for encoding arbitrary byte data. There is no restriction on the maximum length of Base32-encoded data - the ""32 characters"" refers to the set of characters that are used to write the arbitrary byte data in Base32 notation. The resulting string will only contain characters from that set. The only restriction is that the length of the Base32-encoded string must be a multiple of 40 bits.

Here is my code:
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(MessageDigest.ALG_SHA, false);
md.reset();
md.doFinal(toSign, bOffset, bLength, tempBuffer, (short) 0);`

But I do not get the correct answer; neighther for ALG_SHA nor for ALG_MD5.
I'm wondering what the problem is. All samples I have seen use the same methods and parameters.
","The Java Card 2.2.1 specification does not support SHA-256 (or any of the other SHA-2 message digests). It only supports SHA1 and MD5, two complete different cryptographic hash functions. Consequently, neither MessageDigest.ALG_SHA nor MessageDigest.ALG_MD5 will get you an instance of MessageDigest that could calculate the SHA-256 hash function.
Only Java Card 2.2.2 and onwards supports various SHA2 functions. In that specification, the MessageDigest class would also support

SHA-256: MessageDigest.ALG_SHA_256,
SHA-384: MessageDigest.ALG_SHA_384, and
SHA-512: MessageDigest.ALG_SHA_512.

So if you are lucky and your card actually supports Java Card 2.2.2, you could actually use those constants to obtain a proper MessageDigest object.
If your card does not support Java Card 2.2.2, then, of course, you can't use should not1 be able to use those constants. You could still check the manual of your card if it supports some proprietary implementation of the MessageDigest that also has support for SHA-256, though I highly doubt that.


1) Thanks to vlp for pointing out that there are actually cards that are Java Card 2.2.1 (or below) that seemingly support using the constants for SHA-2 algorithms introduced in the Java Card 2.2.2 API. This might just be caused by other implementation bugs and nobody seems to have tested if these algorithms actually work on those cards. See the JCAlgTest list for findings on that.

Here's the bytesToHex(...) method, which I found in another Q&A.  I confirmed that it's doing the right thing by logging Integer.toHexString(b) for each b.
private static final char[] hexDigit = ""0123456789abcdef"".toCharArray();

private static String bytesToHex(byte[] bytes) {
    char[] hexChars = new char[bytes.length * 2];
    for (int i = 0; i < bytes.length; ++i) {
        int b = bytes[i] & 0xFF;
        hexChars[i * 2] = hexDigit[b >>> 4];
        hexChars[i * 2 + 1] = hexDigit[b & 0x0F];
    }
    return new String(hexChars);
}

","Because echo includes a trailing new-line. You can use
echo -n derp | sha256sum

or add \n to your plaintext like
final String plaintext = ""derp\n"";

"26820180","Why am I getting different results between C++ and PHP SHA256 hashes?","I'm trying to generate a SHA256 hash in PHP which will be stored in a database and used for authentication by a C++ program.
In php the hash looks like this:
$mail = strtoupper(utf8_decode('tester@tester.com'));
$password = strtoupper(utf8_decode('password'));

$email = hash_init('sha256');
         hash_update($email, $mail);
$mail  = strtoupper(hash_final($email)); // In C++ the output is uppercase

$sha   = hash_init('sha256');
         hash_update($sha, $mail);
         hash_update($sha, ':');
         hash_update($sha, $password);
$pass  = hash_final($sha);

Or written another way:
$pass = hash('sha256', strtoupper(hash('sha256', $mail)).':'.$password);

In C++ the process looks like this:
Utf8ToUpperOnlyLatin(email);
Utf8ToUpperOnlyLatin(password);

SHA256Hash email;
email.UpdateData(name);
email.Finalize();

SHA256Hash sha;
sha.UpdateData(ByteArrayToHexStr(email.GetDigest(), email.GetLength()));
sha.UpdateData("":"");
sha.UpdateData(password);
sha.Finalize();

return ByteArrayToHexStr(sha.GetDigest(), sha.GetLength(), true);

And the methods:
std::string ByteArrayToHexStr(uint8 const* bytes, uint32 arrayLen, bool reverse /* = false */)
{
    int32 init = 0;
    int32 end = arrayLen;
    int8 op = 1;

    if (reverse)
    {
        init = arrayLen - 1;
        end = -1;
        op = -1;
    }

    std::ostringstream ss;
    for (int32 i = init; i != end; i += op)
    {
        char buffer[4];
        sprintf(buffer, ""%02X"", bytes[i]);
        ss << buffer;
    }

    return ss.str();
}

bool Utf8ToUpperOnlyLatin(std::string& utf8String)
{
    std::wstring wstr;
    if (!Utf8toWStr(utf8String, wstr))
        return false;

    std::transform(wstr.begin(), wstr.end(), wstr.begin(), wcharToUpperOnlyLatin);

    return WStrToUtf8(wstr, utf8String);
}

SHA256Hash::SHA256Hash()
{
    SHA256_Init(&mC);
    memset(mDigest, 0, SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH * sizeof(uint8));
}

void SHA256Hash::UpdateData(const uint8 *dta, int len)
{
    SHA256_Update(&mC, dta, len);
}

void SHA256Hash::UpdateData(const std::string &str)
{
    UpdateData((uint8 const*)str.c_str(), str.length());
}

void SHA256Hash::Initialize()
{
    SHA256_Init(&mC);
}

void SHA256Hash::Finalize(void)
{
    SHA256_Final(mDigest, &mC);
}

The output using the two methods is:
C++: 09FEBAB417CF2FA563AC89963519CCAC53D5F556F8BF20D7EEB818A0584A514E
PHP: 4e514a58a018b8eed720bff856f5d553accc19359689ac63a52fcf17b4bafe09

And if I were to swap
$mail  = strtoupper(hash_final($email)); // In C++ the output is uppercase

for
$mail  = hash_final($email);

The PHP output would be
89ba15a964331258bcc763f44473c492854bf9c2694cc2306da64ccef8ffeab2

Why can't I seem to get PHP and C++ to produce the same result?
Thank you.
","The C++ implementation used the inverse of the bytes returned by the hash. Both methods were correct, but the outputs did not match do to a minor oversight. Thanks to Geoffliu for pointing that out.

The main reason we use strong naming is the ability to use ""InternalsVisibleTo"" in our assemblies.  Since SHA1 is now deprecated I believe we should be switching to SHA256.
I have attempted to generate and use SHA256 as the strong name key file in Visual Studio in .Net 4.0 but it cannot generate one, although I can create an SHA256 through .Net 4.5 and then assign that to my .Net 4.0 project and it appears to accept it when I use the ""Sign the assembly"" feature in Visual Studio.
My question is does .Net 4.0 have the ability to correctly utilize the SHA256 strong name file generated in .Net 4.5?

","The Windows code takes the string, interprets it as a hexadecimal number, and converts two characters a time into one byte. 
Your Mac code most like takes the string as it is. Since the key starts with ""71"", your windows code takes that as a single byte with value 0x71 = 129, your Mac code takes it as two bytes with values '7' = 55 and '1' = 49. 
All you need to do is convert the bytes on the Mac exactly as you do it on Windows. You might have to do the unthinkable and look at the source code of the Mac library to see how it does the actual hash calculation.

I want to use the checksum to annotate a FROM instruction in a derived image:
FROM name@sha256:checksum

I already tried checksums from docker inspect.

Neither the first nor the last of the checksums in the Layers list worked.
The one in ""Id"" did not work.
The one in ""Parent"" did not work.
The one in ""Container"" did not work.
The one in ""Image"" did not work.

Some of them I only tried out of desperation to finally find the correct checksum for my docker image, but I cannot find the correct checksum. Only thing I did not try yet, because of the number of layers, is to go through all of the layers in case they are in a random order. But to put them there like that would not make sense to begin with.
The error I see when I run docker build -t <some name> . in the directory of the Dockerfile of the derived image when it is not working is:
Step 1/7 : FROM name@sha256:<checksum> repository name not found: does not exist or no pull access

"44293192","Seeking information on hardware SHA-2 acceleration","This year AMD has released a new series of x86-64 CPUs named RyZen for desktop. RyZen's specification shows it provides new SSE based SHA1 and SHA-256 instructions wiki: Intel SHA extension:

sha1 instructions: SHA1RNDS4, SHA1NEXTE, SHA1MSG1, SHA1MSG2; 
sha-256 instructions: SHA256RNDS2, SHA256MSG1, SHA256MSG2

I am curious, Do any of the APIs/Libraries already exist that are able to laverage these instruction for ultra fast hashing to be used in PHP or other server side languages, when you use AMD RyZen CPU ? 
If not, when should we expect it to be available ?
Since Intel has provided specification for hardware SHA around year 2013, it seems at least a couple of compilers must have provied support for it.
","Support of hardware-accelerated SHA256 was added to openssl 1.0.2 [22 Jan 2015]:
https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=blob;f=CHANGES

1962  Changes between 1.0.1l and 1.0.2 [22 Jan 2015]

2012   *) Support for new and upcoming Intel processors, including AVX2,
2013      BMI and SHA ISA extensions. This includes additional ""stitched""
2014      implementations, AESNI-SHA256 and GCM, and multi-buffer support
2015      for TLS encrypt.


So, with enabled hardware and recent openssl, any php/python library which uses openssl to compute SHA256 may use hardware accelerated SHA256 digest computation (if enabled in the openssl and if this implementation will be selected by the library). And command-line too: openssl dgst -sha256 -binary file_to_be_hashed.
There are some raw bindings of openssl library in php: http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-digest.php and OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256 is there since PHP 5.5: which openssl version support for sha256 in php
Linux Kernel CryptoAPI may use hardware SHA1/SHA2 since 4.4 version: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-4.4-Crypto (http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1511.0/00383.html); but it is unlikely that PHP/other scripting library will use kernel cryptoapi.

Thans for yours help.
","Let's first understand what params+string does exactly. params is converted into a string, resulting in [object Object]. Then your final string is [object Object]string to hash.
Instead, you might want to get the entire params object as a string. This can be done with JSON.stringify.
console.log(JSON.stringify(params) + string);

the result is then {""name"":""kacper"",""age"":23}string to hash.
Is this what you were looking for? It might be a better practice to make an object with params and string as fields.

Bcrypt seems fantastic, with one flaw as I see it:  if I have a database filled with passwords using a work factor of 10 and I want to increase that work factor to 12 because computational power has increased, then I have no way of doing this without knowing the users password, meaning waiting until they login again.  This causes problems for uses who have abandoned their account.
It seems to me then that an alternate solution would be to use sha256 and do a number of passes equal to 2^(work factor).  If I do this, then when I want to increase the work factor I can just do the difference in the number of passes for every stored password.
I've written a bit of code to do exactly that, and I'd like to get feedback from everyone on whether this is a good idea or not.
https://github.com/rbrcurtis/pcrypt
","Did a lot of digging and reading papers on these various encryption algorithms. What finally gave me a sort-of answer was this question on crypto.stackexchange.com. My algorithm is somewhat similar to shacrypt, which I hadn't heard of previously, but is still not as good as bcrypt. Reason being that bcrypt, in addition to the work factor, also requires more memory to process than the sha2 family. This means that it cannot as effectively be parallelized in GPUs (although to some extent it can be, and more easily in an FPGA) while sha2 can (and easily).  As such, no matter how many passes of sha2 one does, it will still not be as effective as bcrypt.  
As an aside, scrypt is significantly better still because it has both a work factor for CPU and a memory factor (and as such is essentially impossible to parallelize in a GPU or FPGA).  The only issue is that the nodejs library for scrypt is essentially unusable at present so that might be something to put some effort into.

","A potential solution for upping the number of bcrypt passes(or work factor. I don't actually use bcrypt but this is an algorithm-agnostic answer):
For each entry the table where your passwords are stored, also store the number of passes it was hashed with. When you up to more passes, save all new passwords with that number of passes, and set all passwords with less passes than that to expire in 7 days. When they make a new password, hash it with the right number of passes.
Alternatively, you can not reset the password, but the next time they try to login, rehash their password and store it in the table. This does mean that if people haven't logged in, in a long time, their passwords are more susceptible to breach in the event of a DB comprimise. That being said, it's more worth it for the attacker to attack the mass of people with more passes, than the few with less passes(nevermind, because of salts, this last sentence is wrong).

Before I go UPDATE happy and change a bunch of passwords, how does MySQL know which algorithm to use to check my supplied password?  Does it magically know what algorithm was used to encrypt the user's password, or do we specify this in the conf file?

I tested with a new account to see what happens.  Using PASSWORD('mypass') works however applying SHA1('mypass') results in that account not being able to log in.

"35477438","MATH? SHA256 Roulette / Lottery computable?","There is a website where you can play roulette, you can put on the colors only (red, black = double, green = 14x)
The rolls are computed by the following way:
There is a serverSeed EVERY 24 hours its different
This is a precomputed value generated some time in the past.
Seeds are generated in a chain such that today's seed is the hash of tomorrow's seed. Since there is no way to reverse SHA-256 we can prove each seed was generated in advance by working backwards from a precomputed chain.
There is a lotto and round_id too but they are given only the serverSeed is hidden until next day.
Example:
$server_seed = ""39b7d32fcb743c244c569a56d6de4dc27577d6277d6cf155bdcba6d05befcb34"";
$lotto = ""0422262831"";
$round_id = ""1"";
$hash = hash(""sha256"",$server_seed.""-"".$lotto.""-"".$round_id);
$roll = hexdec(substr($hash,0,8)) % 15;
echo ""Round $round_id = $roll"";

This is how rolls are generated with making a new hash everyround as the round ID increments by 1 every roll, the serverSeed and the lotto remains the same whole day.
There is also a history page on the website where you can check every rolled color and number in the past.
My Question: Is there anyway to compute the next roll by the already rolled numbers? (I dont talk about reversing the SHA256 serverSeed or anything like that!!!)
But really isnt any math in this?
I know its MIGHT be all random but i cant imagine this is random.
Here are the yesterday's rolls where you can see the Round IDs too.
I saw the rolls a lot of time repeat sometimes but sometimes its not... I cant believe it doesnt have any math in it.

","The method is an example of ""KDF in Counter Mode"" as defined in NIST SP 800-108, with SHA256 as ""PRF"". As far as i know this method is considered a secure random number generator. So the answer is ""There is no math in it, repetitions are just luck"".

","You need to use the -K option in your openssl line. Then you can provide the hexadecimal key. Otherwise OpenSSL uses it's own key derivation mechanism to derive a key from the password. When supplying -K you should also supply -iv. In this case, to be compatible, the IV should consist of 16 bytes set to zero.
So try the following line:
echo -n ""mysecretstring"" | openssl enc -e -aes-256-cbc -a -K c3ab8ff13720e8ad9047dd39466b3c8974e592c2fa383d4a3960714caef0c4f2 -iv 00000000000000000000000000000000

What could be the reason for this difference?
Edit:
Thanks for the answers @dcsohl and @Alik I understand the reason now. Since I'm porting the Python script to Java I had to keep the Python one as it is so I modified the Java program like this:
byte[] r2 = new byte[]{};
for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
  System.out.printf(""Loop %d\n"", i);
  d.update(r);
  r2 = d.digest();
  System.out.println(toHex(r2));
  byte[] c = new byte[r.length + r2.length];
  System.arraycopy(r, 0, c, 0, r.length);
  System.arraycopy(r2, 0, c, r.length, r2.length);
  r = c;
}

","The two languages run update() and digest() differently.
The python documentation for update() says

Update the hash object with the string arg. Repeated calls are equivalent to a single call with the concatenation of all the arguments: m.update(a); m.update(b) is equivalent to m.update(a+b).

I tested this by using the shell sha256sum command.
echo -n '\0x01\0x4b\0xf5\0x12\0x2f\0x34\0x45\0x54\0xc5\0x3b\0xde\0x2e\0xbb\0x8c\0xd2\0xb7\0xe3\0xd1\0x60\0xa\0xd6\0x31\0xc3\0x85\0xa5\0xd7\0xcc\0xe2\0x3c\0x77\0x85\0x45\0x9a' | sha256sum
981fc8d471a8b01932e384ac1cd0a062c4db2c0e1358619a83d167f5e84e6a17 *-

You started with \0x01 so that's the first byte, and then the rest of the bytes are the hash of 0x01. The resultant hash matches your Python output.
Now look at this - I omitted the initial \0x01 and got the hash back - it matches your Java output.
> echo -n '\0x4b\0xf5\0x12\0x2f\0x34\0x45\0x54\0xc5\0x3b\0xde\0x2e\0xbb\0x8c\0xd2\0xb7\0xe3\0xd1\0x60\0xa\0xd6\0x31\0xc3\0x85\0xa5\0xd7\0xcc\0xe2\0x3c\0x77\0x85\0x45\0x9a' | sha256sum
9c12cfdc04c74584d787ac3d23772132c18524bc7ab28dec4219b8fc5b425f70 *-

But why? Shouldn't the initial \0x01 be included? It would be, except that the javadoc for digest() says:

Completes the hash computation by performing final operations such as padding. The digest is reset after this call is made.

So your initial \0x01 gets dropped when you call digest() in java, and you are simply digesting the old digest without the initial \0x01 entry.

What could be the reason for this difference?
Edit:
Thanks for the answers @dcsohl and @Alik I understand the reason now. Since I'm porting the Python script to Java I had to keep the Python one as it is so I modified the Java program like this:
byte[] r2 = new byte[]{};
for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
  System.out.printf(""Loop %d\n"", i);
  d.update(r);
  r2 = d.digest();
  System.out.println(toHex(r2));
  byte[] c = new byte[r.length + r2.length];
  System.arraycopy(r, 0, c, 0, r.length);
  System.arraycopy(r2, 0, c, r.length, r2.length);
  r = c;
}

","In Java d.digest returns message digest and resets digest in the end.
In Python d.digest doesn't reset digest. Thus, repeated calls d.update actually concatenate with what was passed on previous calls
You can simply put d = hashlib.sha256() inside the loop
import hashlib

def to_hex(s):
  print "" "".join(hex(ord(i)) for i in s)



print ""Entry:""
r = chr(1)
to_hex(r)

for i in range(2):
  print ""Loop"", i
  d = hashlib.sha256()
  d.update(r)
  r = d.digest()
  to_hex(r)

to get the same results as you java program

Never use NULL as:

              reinterpret_cast<const unsigned char*>(data.c_str()), data.length(),

Use special variable (in my code is: diglen and result) for return function.
unsigned int diglen;

unsigned char result[EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE];

digest = HMAC(EVP_sha256(),
              reinterpret_cast<const unsigned char*>(key.c_str()), key.length(),

","The code doesn't understand how the pack() function actually works. The key is what is different between the PHP and Perl scripts, so let's reduce it to just that calculation. Here's a simpler PHP program:
<?php
  $key = pack('H*', 'THIS_IS_KEY');
  echo $key;
?>

If we echo that into php | hexdump, we get:
00000000 0000 0000 000e

Here's a similar Perl program:
my $key = pack('H*', 'THIS_IS_KEY');
print $key;

And if we echo that into perl | hexdump, we get:
0000000 2cd1 cff2 204e

Those are two significantly different keys. In both cases, the pack() call is using an H* format, which means that pack() is expecting to receive an unbounded hex string (a string containing hexadecimal characters 0-9A-F). The problem is that 'THIS_IS_KEY' is not a sequence of hex values (with the exception of the 'E'). If you run the test code through the php binary itself, you'll also see these lines:
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit T in - on line 2
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit H in - on line 2
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit I in - on line 2
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit S in - on line 2
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit _ in - on line 2
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit I in - on line 2
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit S in - on line 2
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit _ in - on line 2
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit K in - on line 2
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit Y in - on line 2

Note that it's every character except for 'E' that throws an error, and note that in your hex output, every character gets converted to a null nibble except for 'E'. Perl actually tries to make something of nonsense characters and converts them to some sort of representation it can use (e.g. 'K' becomes 4, which kind of makes sense since it's the 5th character after F, which would correspond to 14 in hex). Anyway, it's undefined what the behavior should be passed a string that doesn't match the format.
So, what are your solutions?
Well, if you really need to keep 'THIS_IS_KEY' as your key, then the equivalent Perl key is '000000000E0'. If your example key is only a representation of the key value, generally replace the non-hex characters from the PHP key with '0' in the Perl script. PHP appears to be treating non-hex characters as '0' in the hex string.
As for a real solution, either convert your string key to a hex representation or use a straight hex value as your key before passing to pack(). I don't know the details of the key selection or why the ""key"" is being packed anyway. The SHA256 portion of the code just takes a byte-string as the key. It could be a straight ASCII key as far as it's concerned, as long as both scripts use the same sequence of bytes.

password_hash() returns the algorithm, cost and salt as part of the returned hash.

In other words, the salt is handled for you if you use these two functions; you don't need to worry about it.

","There are two major bugs in your code.
The reference Lua 5.2 algorithm at http://lua-users.org/wiki/SecureHashAlgorithm, from which this code is adapted, gives correct answers.
First, the functions band, rrotate and rshift do not work properly because they expect unsigned integers and they sometimes receive negative values. To fix that, add a line telling something like int = int % 2^32 at the start of all those functions to ensure the numbers are between 0 and 4294967295.
There is a second problem. Compared to the reference implementation, the ending lines in the form of H[1] = band(H[1] + a) have been transformed into H[1] = band(H[1], a). This is not the same thing! Replace them with something like H[1] = (H[1] + a) % 2^32 and now the function gives correct answers.

","I'm assuming you never stored the clear-text user account passwords, as this would be truly an awful thing to do.  SO therefore you no longer have the data that you need to create the new password digests.

","There may be other faster and more efficient ways to do this, but if you want to do this without it affecting your users, this is how I would do it -
Add another column to your table, a basic flag that can go True or False. Default it to false. Then implement the following pseudocode :
if(flag=true)
{
 use crypt() and authenticate user
}
else
{
use hash() and authenticate user
use crypt() on the provided password (once authenticated)
update the record to put the new password into the table
set flag=true
}

Essentially it check if the password is updated or not, and updates it if it isn't. You can eventually take this function off, once your users have made the transition. But as it adds almost no load, I would recommend keeping it!
Its a bit roundabout, but it will have the minimal amount of work for your users to do, and it will run in the background without giving them any indication of it happening!

","Id say use a marker field to annotate which users have been previously hashed, then crypt the existing hash. For anyone with a true in the marker field when authenticating it becomes a 2 step process, hash the password then crypt it for a match check.
Whenever they update their password you would set the marker field to false. i.e. phase in and just crypt for a match check.

Since SHA256 is a non-reversible hashing algorithm, is there a way to start using crypt() with the salted passwords without asking everyone to reset their password?
","Yes, what you will need to do is add an extra column that stores the crypt() output. When a user logs in, and their password successfully hash()es to what you have in the database, you can now crypt() that password, and remove the old hash from the database. 
This only works when users log-in, so you will have a period of time where some users are using the old system, and some users are using the new one.

Since SHA256 is a non-reversible hashing algorithm, is there a way to start using crypt() with the salted passwords without asking everyone to reset their password?
","Here's a possible solution:
Add a column to the user table to indicate which hashing method has been used on the user's password. At login time you'll know the user's password since he's just entered it, so once the current hash has been passed, crate a new has from the password and update the flag column
This assumes that you're passing free text passwords across the internet which you shouldn't do unless you're using SSL.
Alternatively, if you're hashing the password on the client before sending it, update the client software to handle two hashing algorithms and send both. Use your flag to identify which to check.
In both cases once all (or the majority of) your users have switched, deleted the old hashes and force the issue for the remaining users.

","You should use the compatibility library then. It will make it easier for you when you move to 5.5.
Re-hashing without asking the user for the password... well, you can wait until the next time users log in, and then use the password extension's password_verify() function. If it fails then you can fall back on the old SHA256 hash. If the SHA256 hash matches then you can rehash the password using password_hash() and save it in the old hash's place:
if (password_verify($password, $hash)) {
    // Matches...
} elseif (hash('sha256', $password) == $hash) {
    // Matches...
    $newHash = password_hash($password);
    // Save $newHash in the old hash's place
} else {
    die('Invalid password...');
}

It is technically possible to crack a lot of the hashes, but there are too many problems with that (you would not get all of them, it is most likely not feasible, it may not even be legal, etc.).

Since SHA256 is a non-reversible hashing algorithm, is there a way to start using crypt() with the salted passwords without asking everyone to reset their password?
","Another approach you may want to consider is hash chaining: since you can't reverse SHA256, just define your new hash function as crypt(sha256($passwd)). Since you presumably already have sha256($passwd) on file for all your passwords, it's possible to crypt() each one of them with an appropriate salt to update your existing hashes (without having to wait for the user to log in).

"32453873","How to truncate a SHA256 key to emulate a 128 key in Ruby","I want to truncate a 256 key to simulate a 128 key. This is easy enough in Python with [:16]

32
>>> hashed_master_key = hashlib.sha256(master_key).digest()[:16]

How can we do the same using Ruby?
2.2.1 :028 > hashed_master_key = Digest::SHA256.digest master_key
 =>     ""\x94DS\xF2:;\x8FU\x9C:v\xB6\xD4\x1C\xB4\xD0\x88/D\xA3\xF0\x91\xBC\x19\x14\x98\xE9\nS^.4"" 
2.2.1 :029 > hashed_master_key.length
 => 32 

","The hashing is not relevant here. Both libraries output the digest as a simple string. So in Python [:16] just takes the first 16 characters
The Ruby equivalent is just as simple:
hashed_master_key = Digest::SHA256.digest( master_key )[0,16]

More Ruby String methods are documented at http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/String.html

NB in Ruby you can often omit the method parameter brackets ( ) and this is a popular style of writing Ruby you will see in documentation and examples. However, that can get in the way of method chaining as used here. If you see Ruby example method calls without brackets, and you'd like to add more to a single line of code, you can feel free to add the brackets back to allow it.

Also, you really should be using StringBuilder rather than StringBuffer in this case because only a single thread is involved.

"37846548","Bitcoin mining: block structure","Hello my dear friends,
I am writing a program using GoLang to mine bitcoins. It's part of my college conclusion project and likely won't be used to mine bitcoins since it's not gonna be efficient enough running on regular PC's (facing a race against those huge chinese mining pools). Though it's not originally intended for real usage, my college expects nothing less than a flawless piece of software to mine real bitcoins (in parallel).
So far, I have implemented quite an extensive code, therefore, you guys may assume I already have means to achieve:


Get pending transactions to fill my block (from https://blockchain.info)
Build the merkle tree over the transactions data retrieved
Calculate a sha256 of a given data input (I also understand the concepts behind such hash functions)


I have organized my questions regarding this subject below:

Question 1) I can't precisely tell how to build a block header which would be appended to the block chain. I know it has fields like the root of our merkle tree (which I already know how to calculate) or a version field, but if I was to produce a block header as an array of bytes, how would I do it ? I'd like to see how to calculate each field we need to build the header and how our byte array (representing the header) would look like. 
Any dummy data may be used for this example, my focus stays on understanding the process and the data structure.
Please, note I have already read this: https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#block-headers

I have studied quite a lot regarding how the bitcoin protocol works to achieve the code I currently have, but I feel extremely limited on the information I can find online regarding the internal details of the bitcoin protocol:

Question 2) Is there any online technical information you guys would consider useful for me to read regarding the headers subject and/or anything else in bitcoin? Keep in mid that I still have quite some code to write, therefore, I'm taking all the information I can get : )

Thanks in advance!

","As @Bart has indicated, this means the sha256 is missing from your imports.  He has provided a JavaScript (AngularJS) example because you have angular in your question tags however your example uses HTML tags.  For completeness, here's the HTML requirements:
<!-- Required scripts -->
<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""rsvp-3.1.0.min.js""></script>
<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""sha-256.min.js""></script>
<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""qz-tray.js""></script>

Alternately, you can avoid RSVP by doing the following:
qz.api.setPromiseType(function promise(resolver) { return new Promise(resolver); });

And, if running HTTPS with JavaScript running on a compatible browser you can avoid SHA256 by doing the following:
function sha256 (str) {
    // We transform the string into an arraybuffer.
    var buffer = new TextEncoder('utf-8').encode(str)
    return crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', buffer).then(function (hash) {
        return hex(hash)
    })
}

function hex (buffer) {
    var hexCodes = []
    var view = new DataView(buffer)
    for (var i = 0; i < view.byteLength; i += 4) {
        // Using getUint32 reduces the number of iterations needed (we process 4 bytes each time)
        var value = view.getUint32(i)
        // toString(16) will give the hex representation of the number without padding
        var stringValue = value.toString(16)
        // We use concatenation and slice for padding
        var padding = '00000000'
        var paddedValue = (padding + stringValue).slice(-padding.length)
        hexCodes.push(paddedValue)
    }

    // Join all the hex strings into one
    return hexCodes.join('')
}

qz.api.setSha256Type(function (data) {
    return sha256(data)
})

... but most people are just fine with @Bart's code snippet.  Here's the full snippet from the QZ Tray wiki, AngularJS section:
import * as qz from 'qz-tray';
import * as sha256 from 'js-sha256';

qz.api.setSha256Type(function(data) { return sha256(data); });
qz.api.setPromiseType(function promise(resolver) { return new Promise(resolver); });

qz.websocket.connect()
.then(qz.printers.getDefault)
.then(function(printer) {
   console.log(""The default printer is: "" + printer);
})
.then(qz.websocket.disconnect)
.catch(function(err) {
   console.error(err);
});

"31772674","Apache Shiro salt hashed password","I need to salt a hashed(SHA-256) password using Apache Shiro. I used the following method, but it uses plainText password as a parameter. But I need to get an alredy hashed password from the frontend and salt it and store in the server side. Otherwise if I use the following method I will have to pass the plain password all the way through frontend, which is not secure. So please suggest me a way to overcome this problem.
String hashedPassword = new Sha256Hash(plainTextPassword, salt);

","You cannot salt the password after it has been hashed. Salting works by combining the salt with the plain text password, and hashing the entire thing. This is why Shiro's Sha256Hash requires you to give it the plain text password.
It is common to pass the plain text password from the front end to the service layer as long as this communication is secure (e.g. HTTPS for web UIs). The only thing you should not do is store the plain text password in a database (which a correctly configured Shiro will not do) because your database may be compromised.
When passing the plain text password from the front end to your service, it will only exist in memory for a short time before being garbage collected. To obtain the password someone would have to either break your SSL connection (in which case you are screwed anyway) or compromise your server and dump the memory (in which case you are screwed anyway).

Every sha256 hash generator I found make the same SHA256 hashes between them but different from priavera's one!
I need to integrate our custom application with primavera so I want to use primavera's users/password to make authentication of the users. Theoretically I need to get user's password, calculate the sha256 hash and compare it with the primavera's hash.
But as I can see there is not really SHA256 hash or primavera uses some password salt stuff.
Is any body know, how exactly primavera calculates password hashes?
","It isn't a straight sha256 hash - that would be too easy. P6 can authenticate through other mechanisms as well as their native one and could change their algorithm whenever they want.
I would advise authenticating to P6 through either the P6 java api or web services. This will protect you against Primavera changes to their authentication algorithms, decouple you from changes to how your company authenticates with P6 (e.g. native or AD/LDAP) and also allow you to delegate p6 access to p6 rather than working that out as well.
Bottom line - if you want to integrate your custom application with P6 then use the P6 integration apis.

","Hashing works one-way, so you cannot really 'retrieve' what you have hashed.
When you save the password on registration, use something like this:
$hash=hash('sha256', $password);

And only save $hash in the database. When the user tries to log in, hash the password he tries to use and compare it to the one in the database (hashing will always give the same result for the same input). If they are the same, he can be logged in (if all additional checks are satisfied).
If you want to let the user recover his forgotten pass, refer to this earlier question.
Also, the best practice in hashing passwords is to use some kind of salt, which is out of the scope of this question, but please google it.

","If using PHP >= 5.5, you should be using password_hash() for storing passwords, and password_verify() to check. If using PHP >= 5.3, you should be using this compatibility module. If using an earlier version of PHP, you should upgrade.
Do not roll your own password hashing. There is no stressing this enough. Take a look at John the Ripper to see how fast passwords that have only been hashed with cryptographic hashes (that are designed to be fast!) can be cracked.

"7003441","SHA Encryption - Are Salts Really Needed?","I'm using Jquery SHA512.js to sent encrypt and send a username and password to the server.
At the server I'm doing the following to create my DB stored HASH:
$dbhash = = hash('sha256',(hash('sha512',$user) . hash('sha256',$extremesalt)));
This all works fine.
My Question is what value is the Salt?
At the point the Salt is applied to the password, the password is already on the server and not in transit across the Internet. Also the Salt is stored next to the password hash. 
Therefore it appears someone would need to get my table with hash's and if they did they could also get the salt and the rest of my code and do what they wanted with my site in general.
I can see its good to apply a salt and I will do so but as it only occurs on the server and not from the browser to the server I question its value. Am I missing something?
One other question - is it possible to apply a salt from the browser to the server. I assume not or at least if you did it would be visible if one checked the source (eg: in my cause visible in jquery). Thus of no real value.
thx
","The point of the salt is to make it harder to see if 2 people's passwords are the same. One thing about SHA is that it's not easily reversible. Most attacks involve generating hashes for common passwords so for reasonably complicated passwords it becomes harder especially with salts (some people use usernames as salts, others use randomly generated numbers). Usually you want to do this on the server side code (I don't think it's safe to do on browser code). You should also never store the actual password on the server you only store the hash (and maybe the salt if you don't already know it)
Upon a second look I see that you're using 2 hashes one after the other 256 and then a 512. This is a bad idea, use one and stick with it. You waste time computing multiple hashes.

","Mixing hashes like that is rather pointless. Taking an sha512 hash and running it through sha256 necessarily cuts the keyspace in half, so all you've done is waste cpu time and double the odds of a collision. The odds will still be vanishingly small/microscopic, but it's still something to consider.
The salt is there as a butt-covering mechanism. If for some reason your database were to leak (e.g. a dump file got ""lost""), it would be trivial to generate an sha256/512 rainbow table of common passwords and see if there's any hits on your table. The hash is there to make it far more expensive to generate a rainbow table. e.g. ""password"" is easy to hash and check for. ""password#^$@#%#^Y#@#$@#^%$^Y%%$"" is far less likely to be rainbowed.

Should be (no need for double hashing) 
$dbhash = = hash('sha512',$pass + $salt);

Where pass is the password and salt is something unique about the user (userid for example). If you opt for random value you need to store it with the hash.

"3079921","Windows C SHA256 Invalid Generation Issue","Hey there. I'm having a very strange problem with creating sha256 hashes. I made a simple C console program that takes a file path as an argument and uses the standalone sha256 code that can be found here. I compiled the program using MinGW 5.1.6 on Windows 7 x64.
When testing the program on a file, the resultant hash is wrong. I made sure of this by using md5deep on the file, and then by using sha256sum on the file under Linux.
I also verified it was not the code by compiling and running the same code on my Linux box with the same file; the hash it produced was identical to the ones produced by md5deep and sha256sum.
I also adapted Aaron Gifford's sha256 implementation into a different version of my simple program and performed the test again on both Windows and Linux and ended up with the same result.
Could it be possible that the issue is being caused by compiler flags that have not been switched on?
My knowledge of C isn't amazing and my knowledge of compiler options is even worse, so any help would be kindly appreciated.
The code for the simple program is below:
#include <stdio.h>
#include ""sha256.h""

#define BUFLEN 16384

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    sha256_context ctx256;
    sha256_starts(&ctx256);
    int kl, l, fd;
    unsigned char buf[BUFLEN];
    FILE *file = (FILE*) 0;
    char *filepath;

    fd = fileno(stdin);

    filepath = argv[1];
    file = fopen(filepath, ""r"");

    fd = fileno(file);
    while ((l = read(fd, buf, BUFLEN)) > 0) {
        kl += l;
        sha256_update(&ctx256, buf, l);
    }
    fclose(file);
    uint8 sha256sum[32];
    sha256_finish(&ctx256, sha256sum);
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 32; i++) {

}

"49024459","Hashing a csv file in python with a key","I have a csv file with 1000+ emailadreses which I want to hash using a SHA256 HMAC and a shared key, encoded to Base64.
There was a similiar problem here, but I can't adapt the solution to work for me. I am new to python and I don't know where to change the code in order to make use of the shared key. 
This is the slightly adapted code from the answer:
import csv
import hashlib
import hmac
import base64

IN_PATH = 'test.csv'
OUT_PATH = 'test_hashed.csv'
ENCODING = 'utf8'
HASH_COLUMNS = dict(Mail='md5')


def main():
    with open(IN_PATH, 'rt', encoding=ENCODING, newline='') as in_file, \
            open(OUT_PATH, 'wt', encoding=ENCODING, newline='') as out_file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(in_file)
        writer = csv.DictWriter(out_file, reader.fieldnames)
        writer.writeheader()
        for row in reader:
            for column, method in HASH_COLUMNS.items():
                data = row[column].encode(ENCODING)
                digest = hashlib.new(method, data).hexdigest()
                row[column] = '0x' + digest.upper()
            writer.writerow(row)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

The input file (.csv) looks like this:
Mail
DHSKA@gmail.com
DJÖANw12@gmail.com
JSNÖS83@ymail.com
HDKDLSA@gmail.com
KKKDLAmS19@yamil.com

And with the code above, the output file looks like this:
0xB6A77B6EB853CC4CC8342B312293FA9C
0xEB439592D8EEC2A38A597350EF80E512
0x833EB6AEC1D03D7D8C94606E0D749B80
0x8007D8D1702E8A749EBD6033A52A7897
0x415E067487C4A5FBDB86AB0F855DB114

But since I do want to use a HMAC with secret key and sha256, the above solution doesn't work for me and I don't know how to incorporate this approach. 
The key would be something like this: 
123Abc

I was trying to do something like this, but for the whole file:
import hmac
import hashlib
import base64

secret = ""123Abc""
secret_bytes = bytes(secret, 'latin-1')
data = ""DHSKA@gmail.com""
data_bytes = bytes(data, 'latin-1')

digest = hmac.new(secret_bytes, msg=data_bytes, digestmod=hashlib.sha256).digest()
signature = base64.b64encode(digest).decode()

Thus, my question is how I can incorporate the HMAC SHA 256 hashing wile using the a secret key, in the above code? I just can't figure out which parameters to change?
","I don't think you need to trouble yourself with the dictionary; you don't have a variable number of columns here, you are applying your transformation to just one column.
It'll be easier to follow if you just put your working HMAC method into a function:
import hmac
import hashlib
import base64

secret = ""123Abc""
secret_bytes = bytes(secret, 'latin-1')

def create_signature(email, secret_bytes):
    data_bytes = email.encode('latin-1')
    digest = hmac.new(secret_bytes, msg=data_bytes, digestmod=hashlib.sha256).digest()
    signature = base64.b64encode(digest).decode()
    return signature

This now neatly produces a Base64 string with a HMAC digest from an email address and your (encoded) secret:
>>> create_signature('DHSKA@gmail.com', secret_bytes)
'3KaSw4QeA5l0rz49uutaDGemn4Et4CQnbnngm6mmpjE='

Now you can apply that to the 'Mail' column values, and write out the new CSV with the results:
with open(IN_PATH, 'rt', encoding=ENCODING, newline='') as in_file, \
        open(OUT_PATH, 'wt', encoding=ENCODING, newline='') as out_file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(in_file)
    writer = csv.DictWriter(out_file, reader.fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()
    for row in reader:
        row['Mail'] = create_signature(row['Mail'], secret_bytes)
        writer.writerow(row)

Demo:
>>> import sys, csv, io
>>> demo_input = io.StringIO('''\
... Mail

... DJÖANw12@gmail.com
... JSNÖS83@ymail.com

"44545577","HMAC and SHA256 - how to validate using nonce","Im trying to integrate with a Web API. Looking at how they use SHA256 and HMAC to generate their signature.  However they also use whats known as an ""nonce"", which I had to look up.  This api generates the ""signature"" using a secret that both of us know, combined with the url of the request.
So, do I use the same nonce they are using to generate a signature on my end to do the validation with?
Im looking at a sample of how they are generating their signature like this on the client end.
        var message = ""https://my.server.com/new-callback?reqID=test&nonce=8cf95201-4d3c-4397-9117-d7ee6ad89d93"";

However, I dont get the same result using this tool 
http://www.freeformatter.com/hmac-generator.html
So to validate this on my end (within the api), I need to use the same inputs to compute the signature and then simply compare the resulting strings, correct?  
What purpose does this ""nonce"" component serve?  From what Ive read, it more or less serves the same purpose as a GUID.
What am I missing?
","The output I get from http://www.freeformatter.com/hmac-generator.html is hex encoded and the value you provided (ihyCCfTHog7TDQYT4tQM5ISYSjEIaChSeJmIo3UMa+U=) is base64 encoded.
If you decode the base64 encoded message, convert it to hex and compare it to the result from freeformatter (which is 8a1c8209f4c7a20ed30d0613e2d40ce484984a3108682852789988a3750c6be5) - they both match. You might be interested in https://stackoverflow.com/a/12987042/3906760 for conversion functions.
And yes: You compute the HMAC on both sides and compare the result. If it matches (no no one else knows the secret) you're safe.
The nonce is a random value in order to prevent replay-attacks (cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce).

Now I read an article about increasing security Level by changing to SHA512. 
What would be the most effect on my code? Would it be more slow? And what are the main arguments for SHA512 to definitely change. Thank you.
","SHA-256 is already providing you with 128 bits of security when it comes to collision resistance. So there isn't all that much need to upgrade; cracking 128 bits of security is not thought possible. The SHA-3 competition has shown us that - besides length extension attacks - SHA-2 is still pretty secure. SHA-512 upgrades your security to 256 bits, so if that's your target then it makes sense to use it. 
Quantum computers could in the end half that 128 bit security to 64 bits of security using Grovers algorithm. That's currently however not feasible at all, and as such a quantum computer could very likely also attack RSA, so upgrading for that reason doesn't seem all that useful.
SHA-512 is often faster on modern computers than SHA-256. That sounds strange, but SHA-512 uses 64 bit operations internally while SHA-256 uses 32 bit. As CPUs are more geared towards 64 bit operation on the desktop you could speed up the processing time and be more secure. Expect a performance hit when switching to 32 bit processing or - worse - 8 or 16 bit embedded CPU's though.

There is also SHA-2 512/256 which is the same as SHA-512 but for the output size (and a few constants). It is however not as prevalent as SHA-256 which doesn't make it a good option in most situations.
The signed data is usually much larger than the SignedInfo, processed by the signature generation algorithm. So changing the DigestMethod makes most sense.
Finally, not that you need about a 16KiB RSA key to be able to hit 256 bits of security. So if you want to upgrade everything to 256 bit security levels you may want to switch to ECDSA with a 512 or 521 bit named curve.

I handle fully qualified paths greater than MAX_PATH by using \\?\UNC\ and \\?\.
Also, from win32 api I can grab the ""short path"" (8.3 name) of file via GetShortPathNameW.
Now that I have the List<string> of fully qualified paths to files, I want to iterate over each path and place their SHA256 into another list (same index).  So roughly, something like this:
List<string> files = new List<string>();
//win api function populates files ...
List<string> hash = new List<string>();
for (int i = 0; i < files.Count; i++)
{
    using (var stream = new BufferedStream(File.OpenRead(files[i]), 1200000))

The problem I face is even if I give it the ""short path"" (8.3 name) the File.OpenRead always throws exception if the fully qualified UNC name is greater than MAX_PATH (260 I believe).
So... now what?  Is there some win32 api function I can import to do the reading instead of File.OpenRead?  Or is there some other .NET method to open files with long file paths?  Any tips to get around this limitation?
","Take a look at the CreateFile function in kernel32.dll. Despite it's name, you can use it to either read or create a file, and the Unicode version will allow you to use paths longer than MAX_PATH.

with three notable exceptions

All of the lines start with /bin/sh -c #(nop) except for the third line which is the RUN command in the Dockerfile - no big deal
The commands are in reverse (the last command in the Dockerfile is the first command listed with docker history) - also no big deal
This one's the kicker - The FROM debian:jessie line from the Dockerfile is translated to:
ADD file:89ecb642d662ee7edbb868340551106d51336c7e589fdaca4111725ec64da957 in /
CMD [""/bin/bash""]

It took me a little while to realize that the last two commands above (the ADD and CMD [""/bin/bash""] lines) were carried over from the base image debian:jessie. Once I figured that out, I thought to myself, ""self, the file:89ec...da957 must be the sha256 hash of the rootfs.tar.xz included as the file system. But no, the sha256 hash of the rootfs.tar.xz is 467328e24c316fd058f086eb8eb77706f3f448ad8886d202e7c9687d30692eca.
Herein lies my question: Where does the hash listed in docker history come from? And why is it different than the actual hash of rootfs.tar.xz?
I've thoroughly reviewed much of Docker's documentation, with no luck, including:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/imagesandcontainers/
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/history/
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/

The hash is consistent across all images that use debian:jessie as the base image. Even docker history debian:jessie shows the same hash:
/bin/sh -c #(nop) CMD [""/bin/bash""]
/bin/sh -c #(nop) ADD file:89ecb642d662ee7edbb868340551106d51336c7e589fdaca4111725ec64da957 in /

and I think you might agree, that there is only one file that could possibly have a hash in the debian:jessie Dockerfile:
FROM scratch
ADD rootfs.tar.xz /
CMD [""/bin/bash""]

If anyone could provide some insight or point me to a resource I have yet to find, it would be much appreciated.
","The docker brew debian image is made of intermediate containers, as described in ""Understand images, containers, and storage drivers"".

On the same side, Itried to encrypt password from C# code, using this:
public string GetSHAEncryptedCode(string Text)
{
    //SHA1 sha26 = new SHA1CryptoServiceProvider();
    SHA256 sha26 = new SHA256CryptoServiceProvider();
    byte[] sha256Bytes = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(Text);

    {
        sha256Str += cryString[i].ToString(""X"");
    }
    return sha256Str;

Suupose, if I enter same ""12345678"" in C# code it returns me a string of 62 character long, string is EF797C8118F02DFB64967DD5D3F8C762348C9C63D532CC95C5ED7A898A64F. Now how could i validate the encrypted string coming from sql server and the other string from C# code in order to login the user from login page?
","Your C# format string is incorrect - it it missing leading 0s when the hex value is less than 10.
Instead you need to use ""X2"" as the format string so that it is padded to 2 numbers:
public string GetSHAEncryptedCode(string Text)
{
    //SHA1 sha26 = new SHA1CryptoServiceProvider();
    SHA256 sha26 = new SHA256CryptoServiceProvider();
    byte[] sha256Bytes = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(Text);

    {
        sha256Str += cryString[i].ToString(""X2"");
    }

This correctly returns EF797C8118F02DFB649607DD5D3F8C7623048C9C063D532CC95C5ED7A898A64F and then you can just append 0x to the start.
In any case, you should not really be converting the values to a string anyway. HASHBYTES() and sha256.ComputeHash() both return byte arrays, so it is more efficient and safer to just compare those instead. You can use the methods described in this answer to do that.
Or maybe better still, I assume you are storing the password in the database as encrypted (aren't you...?), so just encrypt the input value to a byte array in C#, then pass that to the database and use something like
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = @username AND password = @passwordBytes

","In your generate_address_from_public_key_hash method, the checksum should be over the hash including the address prefix. You’re not actually using the pk variable at all at the moment after you assign it. The code should look something like:
def self.generate_address_from_public_key_hash(pub_key_hash)
  pk = ADDRESS_VERSION + pub_key_hash
  encode_base58(pk + checksum(pk)) # Using pk here, not pub_key_hash
end

The mistake seems to also be on the page you link to, I guess the author must have made a copy/paste error.

As an aside, keeping everything in hex strings and decoding back and forth seems an odd way of doing this. I would have thought it would be easier to use raw binary strings, and only encode to hex when printing out values.

","A makefile consists of two different programming languages in one file.  Most of the file uses makefile syntax, that make understands and parses.  But the recipes of the rules use shell syntax, which make doesn't try to interpret: it just passes the contents of the recipe to the shell to interpret.
The recipe is the part of the makefile indented with a TAB character, after a target definition.  So in your example above, the target definition is libz.a: and all the lines after that which are indented with a TAB, are recipe lines.  They are passed to the shell, not run by make.
The recipe is a single block of lines; you cannot intersperse recipe lines with makefile lines.  Once make sees the first non-recipe line, that's the end of the recipe and make starts treating the remaining lines as if they were makefile lines.
Let's look at your rule:
libz.a:
        -rm -rf zlib-$(ZLIB_VER)
        curl -O -L http://zlib.net/zlib-$(ZLIB_VER).tar.gz

OK, this is fine: you've created a target libz.a and provided two command lines, which are valid shell commands, in your recipe.
        ZLIB_SHA256_ACTUAL = $(SHA256_CMD) zlib-$(ZLIB_VER).tar.gz

OK, now you have problems; this is a make variable assignment, not a shell command, but since you've indented it with a TAB make will not interpret it: make will just pass it to the shell.  That's not a valid shell command (in the shell, variable assignments cannot have spaces around the equal sign); this is trying to run a program named literally ZLIB_SHA256_ACTUAL and pass it the arguments = and the expansion of the SHA256_CMD variable.  Even if this was recognized as a make assignment it wouldn't do what you want since it would just set the value of the variable to the string openssl sha256 -r zlib-1.2.11.tar.gz: you want to run that command and set the variable to the output.
Then the next lines:
        ifneq ($(ZLIB_SHA256), $(ZLIB_SHA256_ACTUAL))
                $(error zlib-$(ZLIB_VER).tar.gz checksum mismatch, expected=""$(ZLIB_SHA256)"" actual=""$(ZLIB_SHA256_ACTUAL)"")
        endif

Again, this is wrong because these are make commands but you've put them into a recipe which means they'll be passed to the shell, but the shell doesn't know anything about them.
However, they never get the chance to be passed to the shell because the one thing make does with a recipe before it sends it off to the shell is expand all make variables and functions.  So, when make expands this it runs the error function and that immediately fails and make never has a chance to try to run the recipe.
This is the tricky part of make.  Maybe I've just confused you with all of the above stuff.
The short, simple answer is: you have to use shell commands to perform operations in a recipe.  You cannot use make commands (like ifeq etc.), and if you want to set variables in a recipe they have to be shell variables, not make variables.
So, you want something like this, which uses shell syntax not make syntax for the variable assignment and test.
EDIT Note your SHA generation command doesn't print just the SHA it also prints the name of the file, so you can't compare them as strings: they'll never be the same.  You need to do something fancier; there are many ways to go about it.  Here I decided to use case to do the comparison:
libz.a:
        -rm -rf zlib-$(ZLIB_VER)
        curl -O -L http://zlib.net/zlib-$(ZLIB_VER).tar.gz

            ($(ZLIB_SHA256)\ *) : ok ;; \

","Signature generation is not the same thing as HMAC message authentication and it uses a different key. As HMAC can use a key of any size, it will probably take the private key, but that's not how it is supposed to work. RSA is an asymmetric algorithm that uses private and public keys, MAC uses symmetric, secret keys. The dgst -sign instead uses RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 padding to sign the file.
From the OpenSSL Wiki on dgst:

When signing a file, dgst will automatically determine the algorithm (RSA, ECC, etc) to use for signing based on the private key's ASN.1 info. When verifying signatures, it only handles the RSA, DSA, or ECDSA signature itself, not the related data to identify the signer and algorithm used in formats such as x.509, CMS, and S/MIME. 

HMAC is not the same thing as SHA-256 either. RSA signature generation uses a hash, not a HMAC. You should use the SHA256 class to create a hash. HMAC is a message authentication code build using the SHA-256 hash. However, the SHA class is not needed as signature generation usually includes the hash generation (you sign a message, not a hash value).
So to create a signature, take a look at the RSAPKCS1SignatureFormatter class, it includes an example at the bottom. Try again using this example.
Make sure your message only contains ASCII (both in the text file as in your string) or your result may fail as well.

EDIT: After Ryan's advice and example I've simplified the code down to the following snippit that should be a match for the node code he has posted BUT it still fails in ruby:

  header = { ""accept"" => ""application/json"", ""x-ms-version"" => serv_version, ""x-ms-date"" => date, ""authorization"" => auth_token }
  RestClient.get url, header
end

EDIT2: I believe I've isolated the problem to how I am doing the master key authentication.
Taking Ryan's example we can trim his node code down the following:
var crypto = require(""crypto"")

function encode_message(masterKey, message) {
    var key = new Buffer(masterKey, ""base64""); // encode/decode? base64 the masterKey
    var body = new Buffer(message.toLowerCase(), ""utf8""); // convert message to ""utf8"" and lower case
    return crypto.createHmac(""sha256"", key).update(body).digest(""base64""); // encrypt the message using key
 }

If I call this node code I can produce the following key:
encode_message(""blah"", 'get\ncolls\n\nTue, 14 Apr 2015 13:34:22 GMT\n\n')
'IYlLuyZtVLx5ANkGMAxviDHgC/DJJXSj1gUGLvN0oM8='

If I produce the equivalent ruby code to create the authentication my ruby code looks like the following:
require 'base64'
require 'openssl'

def encode_message master_key, message
  key = Base64.urlsafe_decode64 master_key
  hmac = OpenSSL::HMAC.digest 'sha256', key, message
  Base64.urlsafe_encode64 hmac
end

If I call this code I get the following:
2.2.1 :021 > encode_message(""blah"", ""get\ncolls\n\nTue, 14 Apr 2015 13:34:22 GMT\n\n"")
 => ""N6BL3n4eSvYA8dIL1KzlTIvR3TcYpdqW2UNPtKWrjP8=""

Clearly the 2 encoded auth tokens are not the same. (Ryan again thanks so much for the help to get this far).
","i'll start off by apologizing for my limited Ruby knowledge but let me try assist here;
in your get_master_auth_token function it appears you are decoding the key before using it. is this correct? if so, why?
here is a node.js sample that uses the master key, builds up the auth header value and does a simple http call to list the collections in a database
var crypto = require(""crypto"");
var https = require(""https"");

https.globalAgent.options.secureProtocol = ""TLSv1_client_method"";

var verb = 'get'; 
var resourceType = 'dbs'; //the resource you are trying to get. dbs, colls, docs etc. 
var resourceId = ''; //the parent resource id. note: not the id, but the _rid. but for you, because you are trying to lookup list of databases there is no parent
var masterKey = '...'; //your masterkey 
var date = new Date().toUTCString();

var auth = getAuthorizationTokenUsingMasterKey(verb, resourceId, resourceType, date, masterKey);

var options = {
hostname: '...', //your hostname (without https://)
port: 443,
path: '/dbs/',
method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        accept: 'application/json',
        'x-ms-version': '2014-08-21',
        'x-ms-date': date,
        authorization: auth,
    }
};

for (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    var req = https.request(options, function (res) {
        process.stdout.write(new Date().toUTCString() + "" - statusCode: "" + res.statusCode + ""\n"");
        res.on('data', function (d) {
        }).on('error', function (e) {
        })
    });

    //console.log(req);

    req.end();
}

function getAuthorizationTokenUsingMasterKey(verb, resourceId, resourceType, date, masterKey) {
    var key = new Buffer(masterKey, ""base64"");

    var text = (verb || """") + ""\n"" + 
        (resourceType || """") + ""\n"" + 
        (resourceId || """") + ""\n"" + 
        (date || """") + ""\n"" + 
        ("""") + ""\n"";

    var body = new Buffer(text.toLowerCase(), ""utf8"");
    var signature = crypto.createHmac(""sha256"", key).update(body).digest(""base64"");

    var MasterToken = ""master"";    
    var TokenVersion = ""1.0"";

    return encodeURIComponent(""type="" + MasterToken + ""&ver="" + TokenVersion + ""&sig="" + signature);
}

In your example, the resourceId passed to the getAuthorizationTokenUsingMasterKey method should be """" and the resourceType should be ""dbs"" as you have it. 
I did notice that in some cases you have to URI Encode the value, but I think you are doing that already as the very last line of the func. 
the only difference I can spot in your code vs my code is that you appear to be decoding the master_key which I don't do. 
what I would recommend you do is run this node sample and compare the values of the strings we have in body & signature to the your values. they need to match.

I'm guessing this is why they're asking you to hash 60000 time. To add a work factor and slow down brute force attacks.

How do I make this hashing to work properly?

Something like this:

    // step 1: you can use RNGCryptoServiceProvider for something worth using
    string salt = GenerateSalt();

NEW Question 
  figured that I would go ahead and create a new question , thanks everyone in advance.
Verification of Hashing password is not working
","To me this looks like an attempt to reimplement a PBKDF2 algorithm, to get a cost factor.
Usually it is not recommended to make experiments with security functions, instead one should use a proven well tested algorithm. Your concern about the algorithm above is justified, try to convince your team to switch to BCrypt.Net or to PBKDF2.
When you go for PBKDF2, then you can either use the built in dotnet class Rfc2898DeriveBytes to calculate a PBKDF2 with HMACSHA1 (which is the standard even today), or you can use an implementation which supports other hash functions like PBKDF2 with SHA-256.

","I'll tell you what I would do: I would take the source of the newest (not exactly the newest because it uses Span<>... Just a little older :-) ) of Rfc2898DeriveBytes from the corefx github

"56619355","ES256 JWT Signing in PHP for Apple AppStoreConenct API Auth","I'm trying to authenticate to Apple's AppStoreConnect API with an ES256 signed JWT (per their instructions at https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi) using PHP. 
Sending my request always results in a 401 NOT_AUTHORIZED error.
I've verified that the the contents of my header and claims are correct - I even found a Ruby script online for generating an ES256 signed JWT and using my Apple provided Issuer, Key ID, Private Key, it works swimmingly - Apple accepts the token. That tells me that my credentials are good and I'm doing something wrong in php.
Unless I've simply stared at this code for too long, the JWT format is correct, base64 encoded correctly, and the bearer token is set correctly in the header.
To rule out an issue with request sending I've tried both GuzzleHTTP and CLI cURL - both a 401.

Here's the relevant code. You'll see that the create method is encoding the header and claims, signing the ""payload"", and concatenating all 3.
public function create()
{
    $header = $this->encode(
        json_encode([
            'kid' => 'my_key_id',
            'alg' => 'ES256',
            'typ' => 'JWT',
        ])
    );

    $claims = $this->encode(
        json_encode([
            'iss' => 'my_issuer_uuid',
            'exp' => time() + (20 * 60),
            'aud' => 'appstoreconnect-v1',
        ])
    );

    $signature = $this->encode(
        $this->sign(""$header.$claims"")
    );

    return $header . '.' . $claims . '.' . $signature;
}

This code successfully returns an open ssl resource, $data has the expected contents.
public function sign($data)
{
    if (!$key = openssl_pkey_get_private('file://my_key_file.p8')) {
        throw new \Exception('Failed to read PEM');
    }

    if (!openssl_sign($data, $signature, $key, OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256)) {
        throw new \Exception('Claims signing failed');
    }

    return $signature;
}

Base64 URL encoding... $data has the expected contents.
public function encode($data)
{
    return str_replace(['+', '/', '='], ['-', '_', ''], base64_encode($data));
}

At this point I'm stumped to what it is I'm doing wrong or missing. I'm hoping some extra eyes will find something! Using the token that my code dumps out: 
curl  https://api.appstoreconnect.apple.com/v1/users --Header ""Authorization: Bearer <token>”

...always returns a 401. I suspect there's something wrong in the signing portion of the code as it's the only part I haven't been able to verify (again, worked in Ruby), though looking at all the docs and examples for openssl_sign, I'm pretty sure it's right.

"56619355","ES256 JWT Signing in PHP for Apple AppStoreConenct API Auth","I'm trying to authenticate to Apple's AppStoreConnect API with an ES256 signed JWT (per their instructions at https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi) using PHP. 
Sending my request always results in a 401 NOT_AUTHORIZED error.
I've verified that the the contents of my header and claims are correct - I even found a Ruby script online for generating an ES256 signed JWT and using my Apple provided Issuer, Key ID, Private Key, it works swimmingly - Apple accepts the token. That tells me that my credentials are good and I'm doing something wrong in php.
Unless I've simply stared at this code for too long, the JWT format is correct, base64 encoded correctly, and the bearer token is set correctly in the header.
To rule out an issue with request sending I've tried both GuzzleHTTP and CLI cURL - both a 401.

Here's the relevant code. You'll see that the create method is encoding the header and claims, signing the ""payload"", and concatenating all 3.
public function create()
{
    $header = $this->encode(
        json_encode([
            'kid' => 'my_key_id',
            'alg' => 'ES256',
            'typ' => 'JWT',
        ])
    );

    $claims = $this->encode(
        json_encode([
            'iss' => 'my_issuer_uuid',
            'exp' => time() + (20 * 60),
            'aud' => 'appstoreconnect-v1',
        ])
    );

    $signature = $this->encode(
        $this->sign(""$header.$claims"")
    );

    return $header . '.' . $claims . '.' . $signature;
}

This code successfully returns an open ssl resource, $data has the expected contents.
public function sign($data)
{
    if (!$key = openssl_pkey_get_private('file://my_key_file.p8')) {
        throw new \Exception('Failed to read PEM');
    }

    if (!openssl_sign($data, $signature, $key, OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256)) {
        throw new \Exception('Claims signing failed');
    }

    return $signature;
}

Base64 URL encoding... $data has the expected contents.
public function encode($data)
{
    return str_replace(['+', '/', '='], ['-', '_', ''], base64_encode($data));
}

At this point I'm stumped to what it is I'm doing wrong or missing. I'm hoping some extra eyes will find something! Using the token that my code dumps out: 
curl  https://api.appstoreconnect.apple.com/v1/users --Header ""Authorization: Bearer <token>”

...always returns a 401. I suspect there's something wrong in the signing portion of the code as it's the only part I haven't been able to verify (again, worked in Ruby), though looking at all the docs and examples for openssl_sign, I'm pretty sure it's right.

"51987434","How to generate checksum & convert to 64 bit in Javascript for very large files without overflowing RAM?","Question:   

How to generate a checksum correctly, which is unique, consistent independent of browsers? Also, I would like to convert a SHA256/MD5 checksum string to 64-bit.
How to properly read a file without huge RAM requirement to generate checksum? i.e. how do we deal with 1 GB file without compromising RAM

e.g. Is it possible to read a file without loading it into memory? (see the answer)
This project seems promising, but couldn't get it worked either.

My intention is to generate the checksum progressively/incrementally in chunks of X MBs. This may help to avoid using too much RAM at a time.
Following is the code, which is not working as expected:
let SIZE_CHECKSUM = 10 * Math.pow(1024, 2); // 10 MB; But can be 1 MB too
async function GetChecksum (file: File):
Promise<string>
{
  let hashAlgorithm: CryptoJS.lib.IHasher<Object> = CryptoJS.algo.SHA256.create();
  let totalChunks: number = Math.ceil(file.size / SIZE_CHECKSUM);
  for (let chunkCount = 0, start = 0, end = 0; chunkCount < totalChunks; ++chunkCount)
  {
    end = Math.min(start + SIZE_CHECKSUM, file.size);
    let resultChunk: string = await (new Response(file.slice(start, end)).text());
    hashAlgorithm.update(resultChunk);
    start = chunkCount * SIZE_CHECKSUM;
  }
  let long: bigInt.BigInteger = bigInt.fromArray(hashAlgorithm.finalize().words, 16, false);
  if(long.compareTo(bigInt.zero) < 0)
    long = long.add(bigInt.one.shiftLeft(64));
  return long.toString();
}

It shows different results in different browsers.
","There is a logical issue in the code at below line:
start = chunkCount * SIZE_CHECKSUM;  // <--- bug

The variable start is initialized to 0 and then again reset to 0 in the 1st iteration, which is not right.
Following is the way to get a 32 bytes SHA5 checksum with the same library mentioned in the question: ""emn178/js-sha256"".
That library doesn't provide a Typescript interface, but we can define trivially as following:
// Sha256.d.ts  (also name the corresponding JS file as ""Sha256.js"")
declare class Sha256 {
  update (data: ArrayBuffer): Sha256;
  hex (): string;
}

declare var sha256: any;
declare interface sha256 {
  create (): Sha256;
}

Then use it as following:
import ""./external/Sha256""

async function GetChecksum (file: File):
Promise<string>
{
  let algorithm = sha256.create(); 
  for(let chunkCount = 0, totalChunks = Math.ceil(file.size / SIZE_CHECKSUM); 
      chunkCount < totalChunks;
      ++chunkCount)
  {
    let start = chunkCount * SIZE_CHECKSUM, end = Math.min(start + SIZE_CHECKSUM, file.size); 
    algorithm.update(await (new Response(file.slice(start, end)).arrayBuffer()));
  }
  return algorithm.hex();
}

Above code generates same checksums in all my browsers for any chunk size.

"43808961","Hashing passwords and signature with HMAC any security advantages?","I'm getting a bit confused about hashing passwords with a salt and the way of HMAC an password or using as a signature and so on. I've read a lot of articles about it but it seems that i don't got the point of using this or that.
I got this examples of using that ways (questions marked by a number):
Hashed passwords
Password from user is hashed with SHA-256 and a unique salt for each user stored in the database. Password and salt is just concatenated like this hash(key + password) and run multiple rounds of hashing.

That may be vulnerable for an length extension attack right? 
Would changing the order of values make any prevention of length
extension attacks? So changing hash(key + password) to hash(password + key)?

A better way of hashing the user password seems to be HMAC. In this case using hmac-sha256(password, salt). 

But is this really better and more secure to use HMAC here? 

Some people said it makes no sense to use a salt as a password for HMAC
    but the salt is not visible for the user because it is just stored
    in the database. For me it's nothing other than a password. 
API authentication/validation
For an API all users got a unique and random api_key and an api_secret.
The api_key is sent in all requests by an header to identify the user. That should be a kind of ""stateless authentication"".
The api_secret will be used in backend to generate a signature using hmac-sha256((api_key + nonce), api_secret). 
The nonce is a random value that is send in another header as plain text and as well as a hashed value to verify that the nonce itself won't be manipulated (well not really needed because it will change the whole signature)... so a kind of nonce-signature: 
rand = random();
hash = hmac-sha256(rand, api_secret);
nonce = rand + ""-"" + hash;


But is this really more secure than just make something like hash(api_key + nonce + api_secret) and leave the nonce without any nonce-signature?
Is there any security issue by providing multiple HMAC-hashes at the same time that are hashed with the same api_secret?
Any other toughts about that in point of security?

It's hard for me to understand what the more or less secure ways of creating a secure hash are. Some people said ""ok, this is secure... you should do this"" and then other people said ""oh you forgot this or that attack or vulnerable"". So i try to understand how and why in a simple and ""i-am-a-dummie-way"". 
","SHA-256 is not a great hashing method. Use bcrypt, PBKDF2, or scrypt.
Make your salts the same length and put them first
Peppering (HMAC-ing passwords) is useful if you think you have the chance a SQL injection vulnerability down the road, and a lower chance of an application server vulnerability.
Correct peppering means your application server holds the key and it is not stored in your database. 
If you accidentally have a SQL injection down the road, a hacker might steal all your peppered passwords, but wouldn't be able to steal the key
It sounds like you're going to be doing hashing on every request, which is going to painfully slow. You should hash once and provide a token

document = ""This is a simple string document to be signed""
key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new([private_key])

signature = key.sign digest, document

The signature is transmitted and reaches the destination where it is to be verified. To verify, I do like this:
key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new([pubkey])
digest = OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256.new
key.verify digest, signature, document # => valid

This is working because if we change just one letter of the document or signature, this returns invalid result:
key.verify digest, signature, changed_document # => Invalid

But with a different SHA, the verification command still results in a valid result:
digest = OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256.new('this will generate different SHA')
key.verify digest, signature, document # => valid

It confused me. Shouldn't a different SHA hash result in invalid result? What is the role of digest here?
","Passing an argument to OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256.new causes that data to be added to the digest.
However, the openssl signing functions reset the digest before it is used and so that extra data has no effect in this particular case.

","It is true that you cannot use the system libraries when using web-assembly. So the only solution is to compile them from source in a way the that is compliant with the libraries already provided by the cross-compiler (ie emscripten)
So for your question, I found the library cryptopp, satisfying your use case. The example here showcase how you can use this library.
Now how can you compile this library for your case? Since it comes with a make file, all you need to do is call 
emmake make -f GNUmakefile-cross -j8

This will generate a .a file, which is actually a .bc file and can be linked with your existing C/C++ program, that you wish to run on web. Just make sure to include the headers of this file appropriately. It would even be better if you make a makefile for your project.
P.S I got this working locally in my system, by adding these line at the end of the GNUmakefile-cross file
cryptest.html: libcryptopp.a $(TESTOBJS)
    $(CXX) -s DISABLE_EXCEPTION_CATCHING=0 --preload-file TestData -o $@ $(strip $(CXXFLAGS)) $(TESTOBJS) ./libcryptopp.a $(LDFLAGS) $(LDLIBS)

I changed the test.cpp file to include sample code for ""HMAC"" and then called the following lines from the command line
emmake make -f GNUmakefile-cross cryptest.html -j8

The output ie cryptest.html, when opened in firefox worked flawlessly.

Here are the results for the sample run:


EDIT: 
Info on the HMAC_SHA256 function can be found here. The one I wrote is just for demonstration purposes. One can modify it accordingly.
EDIT 2: 
I added the code for Base64 format. I used the information found on Wikipedia. Sample test run works for OP's input and output. Results are as shown:

The following JS fiddle, describes what I want to accomplish with C.
https://jsfiddle.net/gm7boy2p/813/
I'm struggling with integrating a 3rd party code and complie it with emcc.
I'm looking for a light weight library or a snippet.
Example code or any help would be appreciated.

Update: After extra research, reading this stackoverflow question and this article, it looks like using openssl or any other external library with WebAssembly is far from trivial. So what I'm looking for now is a standalone C function that I could integrate to my existing code.
","I've created a simple example of how you can create the hmac with the libgcrypt library. You just need to install it in your system and them compile the program with the -lgcrypt flag to link the library.
As you've asked a standalone function, I created a function which you can call with the key and message that returns a string with the base64 encoded result, which is exactly what you asked for in your JSFiddle.

Important remarks:
-Don't forget to free the return value of the hmacSHA256 function and to call gcry_mac_close when you are done hashing.
-I've included the size of the key and size of the message in the function's arguments because this way you can do the HMAC of binary data as well as ASCII/UTF-8 encoded strings. If you're not going to use binary data, feel free to remove the sizes from the arguments and calculating the size inside of the function with strlen like I did in the main when I called the function.
-I didn't wrap the creation of the gcry_mac_hd_t in the function because it's more efficient to reuse the same handler and just reset it every time you need to reuse it then to create a new one every time you need it. This optimization is even more noticeable if you call this function many times in the same execution!

"48177791","how to specify signature length for java.security.Signature sign method","For my application, I'm trying to sign some byte contents using java.security.Signature class. The problem I'm having is that signature is never generated at a fixed length. For instance, sometimes it is generated at a length of 135, 136 or 137 bytes. Is there a way to specify the length or some padding at the end? Any other ideas or comments are appreciated.
    private byte[] ecdsaSign(ECPrivateKey key, byte[] content) throws Exception {

","For ECDSA Java crypto uses the ASN.1 DER encoding standardized by X9.62, SEC1 and rfc 3279 sec 2.2.3, which varies slightly in length. This is covered in more detail on another Stack: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/how-can-i-convert-a-der-ecdsa-signature-to-ASN.1 and https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/33095/shouldnt-a-signature-using-ecdsa-be-exactly-96-bytes-not-102-or-103 and https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/37528/why-do-openssl-elliptic-curve-digital-signatures-differ-by-one-byte 
This is also true for DSA, but not RSA, where signatures (and cryptograms since RSA supports both signature and encryption) are fixed length for a given key, as defined by I2OS and OS2I in PKCS1. 
If you want a different encoding, such as the fixed-length one used by PKCS11 (and your provider name ""SC"" suggests that possibility), you must convert it.
Added 2019-10: you no longer have to do it yourself in Java; BouncyCastle since 1.61 (2019-02) correctly supports this, as does SunEC in Java 9 up (2018-12). See later near-dupe Java ECDSAwithSHA256 signature with inconsistent length .

"24542626","Objective-C HMAC-256 To Sign HTTP Request - Seeing different results","I'm working in Objective-C with a REST API that needs to sign each HTTP request according to this spec (https://web-payments.org/specs/source/http-signatures/). 
It all seems straightforward, but I'm having troubles getting what the right ""signature"" value should be. I'm getting different results in Objective-C VS some of these online sha generators (http://www.freeformatter.com/hmac-generator.html, http://hash.online-convert.com/sha256-generator).
I put together some sandboxed test code to get this figured out outside of my project.
Here's my test code:
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <CommonCrypto/CommonCrypto.h>

NSString * hmacSHA256(NSString *key, NSString *data) {
    const char *cKey  = [key cStringUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding];
    const char *cData = [data cStringUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding];
    unsigned char cHMAC[CC_SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH];
    CCHmac(kCCHmacAlgSHA256, cKey, strlen(cKey), cData, strlen(cData), cHMAC);
    NSMutableString *result = [NSMutableString string];
    for(int i = 0; i < sizeof cHMAC; i++) {
        [result appendFormat:@""%02x"", cHMAC[i]];
    }
    return result;
}

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        NSMutableString * data = [NSMutableString string];
        [data appendString:@""(request-line) get /\n""];
        [data appendString:@""date: Wed, 02 Jul 2014 22:12:37 GMT""];
        NSString * key = @""5a30f5477e2fdea27c5bdef8d5b0b13bfc8c2c77c608169da637a58ac0bff23895b58f8de5ef982a"";
        NSLog(@""%@"",data);
        NSString * signature = hmacSHA256(key,data);
        NSLog(@""signature: %@"",signature);
    }
    return 0;
}

When I run this test code, I get this as a signature:
8315081c226a7b0a77093cf12ec6ce4e112fedff12ddfcfd752c909b58a9ae5e

But when I paste in these lines:
(request-line) get /
date: Wed, 02 Jul 2014 22:12:37 GMT

To one of the online generators (http://www.freeformatter.com/hmac-generator.html, http://hash.online-convert.com/sha256-generator) both of these generators give me the same signature:
71b09a1d0b8cde88f2b0c5bb78a06c4539994435e5e47700aa56d2194b9c2f08

So how exactly am I supposed to convert the above ""unsigned char cHMAC"" variable into the proper string?
Thanks.
","Your problem is the line endings in your text. In reality, your program is generating the correct hash, but you're entering a different string into the web tool, which is why you're getting a different result. Here's the text you're feeding to your program:
(request-line) get /\ndate: Wed, 02 Jul 2014 22:12:37 GMT

And here's what you're feeding to the web tool (assuming you're doing so on Windows, which checks out based on my tests):
(request-line) get /\r\ndate: Wed, 02 Jul 2014 22:12:37 GMT

Note the '\r\n'. By default, Windows (and, most likely, all web browsers) uses a carriage return AND a line feed character as an EOL sequence. Unix/Linux uses only a line feed, and Mac uses only a carriage return.
If you want to check any other hashes, either add a '\r' into your program for testing, or use a program like Notepad++ where you can control the line endings to create files and then upload them to the second site you listed.

"50038666","How to convert a crypto::sha2::Sha256 hash into a &[u8] representation?","I'm currently trying to generate an ED25519 keypair from a SHA256 hash (via rust-crypto crate):
extern crate crypto; // rust-crypto = ""0.2.36""

use crypto::ed25519;
use crypto::sha2::Sha256;
use crypto::digest::Digest;

fn main() {
    let phrase = ""purchase hobby popular celery evil fantasy someone party position gossip host gather"";
    let mut seed = Sha256::new();
    seed.input_str(&phrase);
    let (_priv, _publ) = ed25519::keypair(&seed); // expects slice
}

However, I totally fail to understand how to correctly pass the SHA256 to the ed25519::keypair() function. I traced down that &seed.result_str() results in:
""fc37862cb425ca4368e8e368c54bb6ea0a1f305a225978564d1bdabdc7d99bdb""

This is the correct hash, while &seed.result_str().as_bytes() results in:
[102, 99, 51, 55, 56, 54, 50, 99, 98, 52, 50, 53, 99, 97, 52, 51, 54, 56, 101, 56, 101, 51, 54, 56, 99, 53, 52, 98, 98, 54, 101, 97, 48, 97, 49, 102, 51, 48, 53, 97, 50, 50, 53, 57, 55, 56, 53, 54, 52, 100, 49, 98, 100, 97, 98, 100, 99, 55, 100, 57, 57, 98, 100, 98]

Which is something I do not want, something entirely different. The question now breaks down to:
   |

   |                                           ^^^^^ expected slice, found struct `crypto::sha2::Sha256`
   |
   = note: expected type `&[u8]`
              found type `&crypto::sha2::Sha256`

How to correctly convert the crypto::sha2::Sha256 hash into a [u8] representation?
","The Sha256 API may be a little confusing at first because it is designed so that it doesn't allocate any new memory for the data. That's to avoid wasting a memory allocation, in case you want to allocate it yourself. Instead, you give it a buffer to write to:
// Create a buffer in which to write the bytes, making sure it's
// big enough for the size of the hash
let mut bytes = vec![0; seed.output_bytes()];
// Write the raw bytes from the hash into the buffer
seed.result(&mut bytes);

// A reference to a Vec can be coerced to a slice
let (_priv, _publ) = ed25519::keypair(&bytes);

With this the input and length can easily be verified. The chance of the error is less because _input is only used once.

","PasswordDeriveBytes is not a hash function, it is a key derivation function. It follows PBKDF1 precisely until you exceed 20 bytes of output, for which PBKDF1 was designed. When that happens it turns into a proprietary, badly programmed, insecure and unknown key stretching function.
PBKDF1 uses SHA-1 to implement the key derivation. SHA-256 is a rather more secure hash function with a larger output. So you will never ever have the same output for both functions. If you would, you will have broken one of the two - or much more likely you will have made a mistake.
Note that you should use PBKDF2 over PBKDF1 as it is more secure and does provide key stretching.

","Your bug is related to the fact that you initialize your static field StandardByteDigester digester in an instance initializer block instead of a static initializer bloc such that it is never called as you never create an instance of your class so at the end it uses the default configuration with random salt.
Try this:
static {
    digester.setAlgorithm(""SHA-256"");
    digester.setIterations(100000);
    digester.setSaltSizeBytes(0);
    digester.initialize();

Your code could be simplified if your method encodePassword took a String instead of a char array as you could simply call getBytes(Charset) as next:
public static String encodePassword(String rawPass) {
    return new String(
        Base64.encodeBase64(digester.digest(rawPass.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8))),
        StandardCharsets.US_ASCII
    );
}

NB: It is not a good practice to rely on the platform's default charset as your code would then be platform's dependent so here as base 64 characters are all included in US_ASCII, let's use this charset to decode.

","I'd first make sure your code works outside of Lightroom. It seems that HMAC module you referenced has some other dependencies: it requires ""glue"", ""bit"", and ""ffi"" modules. Of these, bit and ffi are binary modules and I'm not sure you will be able to load them into Lightroom (unless they are already available there). In any case, you probably won't be able to make it run in LR if you don't have required modules and can't make it run without issues outside of LR.

For example if you look at the properties of vstest.executionengine.exe from Visual Studio 2013 (look at the properties on Windows 8 or Server 2012) you'll see it has 3 different signatures from 3 different certificates.
I already have code that uses a combination of CryptQueryObject, CryptMsgGetParam, and .NET SignedCms, but it only sees 1 of the 3 signatures. There appears to be only one message with one signer.
I need to get the certificate information for all signatures. How are multiple signatures modeled - is it multiple messages, or multiple signers in a single message? Did Microsoft add new APIs or new flags to access multiple signatures?
","It turns out that Microsoft (sort of) hides subsequent signatures.  When adding another signature, the entire CMS structure is added as an unsigned attribute.
So for example a dual-signed Authenticode signature decoded as a .NET SignedCms will have one signer, and that SignerInfo will have a value in UnsignedAttributes.  If you take the attribute ASN RawData value and pass it to SignedCms.Decode, you get the second signature.

It also appears that instead of adding another attribute to the root signature signer, the attribute is added in the inner-most signers attributes.
Also note that not all attributes are inner signatures, I think you need to check for a proper Oid on the attribute.
Is suspect that this was the best way for Microsoft to keep backward compatibility.

","You're inserting raw binary garbage. That will naturally (and semi-randomly) contain SQL metachatacters, like a '. This means your query is vulnerable to sql injection attacks.
You don't show any of your actual PHP code, but you should either be using a prepared statement, or doing manual escaping, e.g.
$stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, ""INSERT .... (password_hash) VALUES (?)"");
$stmt->execute(array($raw_hash));

or
$quoted = mysql_real_escape_string($raw_hash);
$sql = ""INSERT ... (password_hash) VALUES ('$quoted')"";

Alternatively, you could encode that hash string, e.g. use base64, so that the encoded hash becomes a relatively harmless string. But even then you should be using proper query construction techniques.

Will give you the size of an unsigned char pointer - 4 bytes on a 32 bit device and 8 on a 64 bit.

as that will give you the number of bytes to be hashed

"39841363","ColdFusion hmac() returns different values with toBase64 and binaryEncode","I am attempting to use ColdFusion's hmac() function to calculate an HMAC value using binaryEncode(binaryObj,'Base64') instead of toBase64() since that function is deprecated. It works perfectly with toBase64() but not with binaryEncode(). The docs are not very informative. Can someone help me understand why I cannot get the same value using binaryEncode?
From what I understand, the hmac() function returns the results in hexadecimal format. binaryEncode() expects a binary value, so thehmac() results must be first converted from hex to binary, before it can be converted to base64.
<cfset string = ""1234567890"" />
<cfset secretKey = ""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"" />
<!--- Get Hex results from HMAC() --->
<cfset hmacHex = hmac(string,secretKey,'HMACSHA256') />
<!--- Decode the binary value from hex --->
<cfset hmacAsBinary = binaryDecode(hmacHex,'hex') />
<!--- Convert binary object to Base64 --->
<cfset hmacBase64 = binaryEncode(hmacAsBinary, 'base64') />
<cfoutput>
    <!--- incorrect hmac signature --->
    hmacBase64: #hmacBase64#<br>
    <!--- correct hmac signature --->
    toBase64: #toBase64(hmac(string,secretKey,'HMACSHA256'))#<br>

One thing I noticed is the results are much longer when using toBase64(). I can't seem to figure out why I can't use binaryEncode(). However, I would like to, since toBase64() is being deprecated. Any insight is much appreciated. Thanks!
","Update based on comments:
Well using ToBase64(Hmac(...)) is not the correct way to convert a hex string to base64 ;-) However, it sounds like the API requires something other than a straight conversion.  If so, just do what the ToBase64(hmac(...)) code is doing. ie Decode the hex string as UTF8 and re-encode it as base64: 
matchingResult = binaryEncode(charsetDecode(hmacHex, ""utf-8""), ""base64"")

Short answer:
The two methods are encoding totally different values. That is why the results do not match. The correct way to convert the hex string to base64 is using BinaryEncode/Decode().
Longer answer:

<!--- correct hmac signature --->
toBase64: #toBase64(hmac(string,secretKey,'HMACSHA256'))#<br>

Actually that is not the correct way to convert hex to base64. 
Hexadecimal and Base64 are just different ways of representing a binary value. In order to get the same results, the two methods need to start with the same binary. In this case, are actually encoding totally different values. Hence the difference in the results. 
With a hexadecimal string, each byte is represented by two characters. So the binary will be half the size of the original string. In the case of HMAC(HMACSHA256), the resulting hex string is 64 characters long. So the binary value should be 32 bytes. To obtain the correct binary value, the string must be decoded as hex:
original string length = #len(hmacHex)#
binary size = #arrayLen(binaryDecode(hmacHex, ""hex""))#

The problem with ToBase64 is that it decodes the string incorrectly. It treats the input as UTF8 and decodes the characters in the string individually. So the binary value is double the size it should be. Notice it is 64 bytes, instead of 32? That is why the final string is longer as well. 
UTF8 binary size = #arrayLen(charsetDecode(hmacHex, ""utf-8""))# 
ToBase64 binary size = #arrayLen(binaryDecode(toBase64(hmacHex), ""base64""))#

So again, the two methods produce different results because they are encoding totally different values. However, strictly speaking, only the first method is correct. To re-encode a hex string as base64 use binaryEncode/binaryDecode: 
correctResult = binaryEncode(binaryDecode(hmacHex, ""hex""), ""base64"")

I did some research and found two functions that seem to be connected to PBKDF2 and HMAC:

hash_pbkdf2 - http://php.net/manual/en/function.hash-pbkdf2.php
hash_hmac - http://php.net/manual/en/function.hash-hmac.php

What PHP functions should I use? Is it even possible with native PHP functions?
Edit #1
My Java code, the same result I need achieve in PHP
public static byte[] derivateKey(char[] password, byte[] salt, int iterations, int keyLengthBits) {
        try {
            SecretKeyFactory skf = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256"");
            PBEKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password, salt, iterations, keyLengthBits);
            SecretKey key = skf.generateSecret(spec);
            byte[] res = key.getEncoded();
            return res;

        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException | InvalidKeySpecException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException(""Could not create hash"", e);
        }
    }

","The Java code you've provided is basically hash_pbkdf2(). You just need to pass the correct params:
function derivateKey($password, $salt, $iterations, $keyLengthBits)
{
    return hash_pbkdf2(
        'sha256',
        $password,
        $salt,
        $iterations,
        $keyLengthBits / 8,
        true
    );
}

Obviously, PHP's hash_pbkdf2() accepts the hash algorithm as a parameter, but the potentially tricky differences are these:

It doesn't comply with RFC 2898 in that its length is applied after hex-encoding, so that last parameter must be set to true to make it consistent with the spec.
It accepts the output length in bytes instead of bits (hence why we divide by 8 above).

The only thing I'm not sure about is what key.getEncoded() does in your sample code ... there's no encoding algorithm specified anywhere.
I found some docs suggesting it is supposed to be RAW, so the example I'm providing should match it. If it doesn't, you'll have to encode it yourself.

                    'Action=ListUsers&Version=2010-05-08\n'+

So SHA256 is working properly on that. Similarly, using the Hmac-SHA256 on the following input I get the correct response:
var kDate = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(""20150830"", ""AWS4wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"");
var kRegion = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256('us-east-1', kDate);
var kService = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256('iam', kRegion);
var kSigning = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(""aws4_request"", kService);

console.log(kSigning.toString()); //returns the expected value of c4afb1cc5771d871763a393e44b703571b55cc28424d1a5e86da6ed3c154a4b9

So this Hmac-SHA256 function works correctly on this input. However, on the following input, Hmac-SHA256 DOES NOT return the expected output.
var stringToSign = 'AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\n'+
                '20150830T123600Z\n'+
                '20150830/us-east-1/iam/aws4_request\n'+
                CryptoJS.SHA256(canonString).toString();

CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(kSigning.toString(), stringToSign); //Returns 8a96b6691875490d30d05731cc9aa26be1fd64cf611ed929753b6498075aa886

//Trying in opposite order just in case
CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(stringToSign, kSigning.toString()); //Returns fe52b221b5173b501c9863cec59554224072ca34c1c827ec5fb8a257f97637b1

So, something is clearly going wrong with my stringToSign, and I don't know what it is. I was thinking that the newline character is being interpreted as two different characters and not just a single character. However, escaping it like '\\n' did not fix it either! I am at a loss here. Here are the two docs I've been following (doc1 doc2). Does anyone know why I can't get the expected output?
","Remember that the sha256 digest is a byte sequence: it is not a ""normal string"". It looks like CryptoJS is converting the true sha256 digest to something else for convenience, so make it not do that and you're good to go.
Using Node's crypto library (which is a built-in API) rather than CryptoJS (which has absolutely terrible documentation, so using it is kind of questionable):
const crypto = require(""crypto"");

function HMAC(key, text) {
    return crypto.createHmac(""sha256"", key).update(text).digest();
}

And then we form the canonical hash:
const canonString = [
    'GET',
    '/',
    'Action=ListUsers&Version=2010-05-08',
    'content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8',
    'host:iam.amazonaws.com',
    'x-amz-date:20150830T123600Z',
    '',
    'content-type;host;x-amz-date',
    'e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855'
].join('\n');

// note: plain hash, not a secret-key-seeded hash
const canonHash = crypto.createHash(""sha256"").update(canonString).digest();
console.log(""Canonical hash is   :"", canonHash.toString('hex'));

This yields f536975d06c0309214f805bb90ccff089219ecd68b2577efef23edd43b7e1a59. We then continue:
const kSecret = ""wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"";
const kDate = HMAC(""AWS4"" + kSecret,""20150830"");
const kRegion = HMAC(kDate,""us-east-1"");
const kService = HMAC(kRegion,""iam"");
const kSigning = HMAC(kService,""aws4_request"");
console.log(""kSigning hash is    :"", kSigning.toString('hex'));

Which yields c4afb1cc5771d871763a393e44b703571b55cc28424d1a5e86da6ed3c154a4b9: note that we do not do any hex conversion, because the hex digest is not the sha256 digest, it's a completely different string. We only convert to hex string to make the digest legible in the console log.
Then finally:
const stringToSign = [
    'AWS4-HMAC-SHA256',
    '20150830T123600Z',
    '20150830/us-east-1/iam/aws4_request',
    canonHash.toString('hex')
].join('\n');

const signed = HMAC(kSigning, stringToSign);
console.log(""Final signed hash is:"", signed.toString('hex'));

Which yields 5d672d79c15b13162d9279b0855cfba6789a8edb4c82c400e06b5924a6f2b5d7. Note that here, we had to turn the canonical hash into a hexadecimal string, as per the instructions in the pages you link to, but we do not touch the kSigning digest, that has to stay a real sha256 byte string.

So far i can see that in the version of ios 10 you can set the algorithm with this line

my question is, how do i get that algorithm in the early version of ios, the second code i post can't be decrypted.

","If you are using OAEP padding with SecKeyEncrypt, you can only use kSecPaddingOAEP, which is SHA1. Unfortunately you cannot use OAEP SHA256 with SecKeyEncrypt.

should be changed to:

How I can make it work?
","Your cryptography code is awry. :-)
Code Samples
What follows are working code samples that ""call the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm on the UTF-8-encoded signature string and encode the result as Base64."" In the below samples, the hashKey parameter is the ""Primary Access Key"" from Azure and the toSign parameter is the ""Signature String"" from the docs.
Encoding the Signature on Windows Phone 8.1
On Windows Phone 8.1 we use the Windows.Security.Cryptography namespace like this:
public string GetEncodedSignature(string toSign, string hashKey)
{
    // UTF-8-encoded signature string
    var utf8 = BinaryStringEncoding.Utf8;
    var msgBuffer = CryptographicBuffer.ConvertStringToBinary(toSign, utf8);

    // primary access key
    // note the use of DecodeFromBase64String
    var keyBuffer = CryptographicBuffer.DecodeFromBase64String(hashKey);

    // make the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm
    var alg = MacAlgorithmNames.HmacSha256;
    var objMacProv = MacAlgorithmProvider.OpenAlgorithm(alg);
    CryptographicHash hash = objMacProv.CreateHash(keyBuffer);

    // call the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm
    hash.Append(msgBuffer);
    IBuffer hashMsg = hash.GetValueAndReset();

    // retrieve the result!
    var result = CryptographicBuffer.EncodeToBase64String(hashMsg);

    return result;
}

Encoding the Signature in .NET
I also created an example for .NET that uses the System.Security.Cryptography namespace.
public static string GetEncodedSignature(string toSign, string hashKey)
{
    byte[] bytes;
    byte[] unicodeKey = Convert.FromBase64String(hashKey);
    var utf8encodedString = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(toSign);
    using (var hmac = new HMACSHA256(unicodeKey))
    {
        bytes = hmac.ComputeHash(utf8encodedString);
    }

    var signature = Convert.ToBase64String(bytes);
    return signature;
}

Both code samples produce the same encoded signature when given the same inputs. You can see one of them in more detail at this Fiddle that generates the HTTP Request.

"52716046","Sign a string with RSA SHA 256 with ONLY the Private Key as a String .NET","We're doing an integration with Google via RESTful API and I need to sign a payload of a JWT with RSA-SHA256 and all I have is a Private Key as a string, that looks like
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEvgIBfADANBg9qhkdsiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKgw
......
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----

I've been looking everywhere for a solution, but everyone's talking about X509Certificate2 which needs a p12 file, or some Certificates. Now I don't have either of those, I only have a string that is the private key.
Google recommends https://jwt.io/ and it works with the key string, but well, I need my CODE to do it. There are 3 libraries listed in the page:

One of them belongs to Microsoft and has absolutely no documentation.
Another one is using X509Certificate2 or specifically for string keys only has a link to this place http://www.donaldsbaconbytes.com/2016/08/create-jwt-with-a-private-rsa-key/ which uses some Certificate files I don't have, making it a wrong and unhelpful link to begin with.
Same creators of #2 have another lib, but it's for phones and it actually has a method for RSA256 signing which takes private key as a string of exactly my format.

So my question is - is there some working solution for my case? Because I can't believe that no one else has integrations with Google.
","I know of a way to convert this to a pfx that you can use in C#.
First, install OpenSSL if you haven't already. (You could get the latest ""Win64 OpenSSL v#.#.#x Light"" from http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html, though I take no responsibility for this source.)
You may want to add ""C:\Program Files\OpenSSL\bin\"" to your account's path variable, so that ""openssl.exe"" can be used from anywhere in the command line.
In a command window, navigate to where your private key file is. Let's call it ""priv.key"". Issue the following two commands, ignoring the comments:
# Create public self-signed certificate CRT file (with 7000yr validity) from private key (may leave all info empty)
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -new -key priv.pem -out pub.crt -days 2555000

# Combine into PFX container (encrypted with AES-256) (certificate needs to be included for .NET to read successfully)
openssl pkcs12 -export -aes256 -CSP ""Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider"" -inkey priv.pem -in pub.crt -out priv.pfx

Note that on the last command, I am creating an encrypted pfx (this is optional - I believe you could replace -aes256 by -nodes to skip it), and I am configuring the cryptographic provider such that the key can be used for SHA256 operations without C# complaining.
You now have a pfx file that you can load using the constructor of X509Certificate2.
I tend to use this cheat sheet for common OpenSSL commands:

","Which OS? 
If it is Linux, once it slows down take a look at the available entropy (cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail). If that number is less than 250 or so, you need more randomness on the system. It is a common issue on servers. Network traffic or disk IO can help.
To make it more difficult to diagnose, you might actually get a brief speed up as you log in. That is because the log in itself generates some network traffic which helps add some randomness to the entropy pool. On the other hand, SSHing into the box may be painfully slow as it needs some randomness for the SSH session keys. In either case (speed up after log in or slow log in), entropy is a likely issue.
You can consider adding some additional sources of randomness, such as haveged or rng-tools.
You may see suggestions to copy some ""randomness"" from /dev/urandom to /dev/random, which will appear to fix the problem. But /dev/urandom does not actually have any randomness, it is just a PRNG seeded with randomness. So this just avoids the issue by compromising the security of the crypto you are using. Just say no.

","I had exactly the same problem, entropy is not the cause. SHA256 digest doesn't need random. The problem is JIT (Just in time) compilation mechanism that allow to compile some Hotspot function directly in native code. There is a known issue in JDK7 see : http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/javase7supportreleasenotes-1601161.html that disable the native compiler when code cache is full. In this case SHA digest is not executed natively and become very long !
To reproduce just disable the compiler :
-Djava.compiler=NONE 

The solution is to migrate to Java 8, a workaround for Java 7 is to increase the CodeCache size according to your needs by using the JVM option. 
-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=300m
You can monitor your code cache through JConsole :

I hope it will help :)

","If you would be able to ""decode"" those passwords, it wouldn't be a very safe system.  Once someone gained access to your database - they would be able to gain access to every ones passwords without them knowing...
If you have ever forgotten a password for a site (and we all have - don't deny it!), you'll recall that they usually* don't simply send you your password (in plain text) as a reminder to your email - they'll give you the opportunity to reset it.  This way (verifying usually through your email/phone number) they'll know that you are indeed the person who opened the account.
* If they send you your password in plain text that probably means they are storing it like that or in some other easily decrypted form.  This site is most likely not as secure as they would like to think...

If you are interested in leaving yourself a ""backdoor"" of sorts to be able to access any of your users accounts, what you might think of doing is having a special login form from inside your administrator account, that allows you to use the encoded password to log in.  That means that you simply leave out the hash('sha256', $password) and pass the $password already encoded (which you extract from your database).  It's a bit hacky, and if you already have an administrator account then there wouldn't be much use to be able to log in as a different user because you are already all powerful!

Never never never hold password in open format in database. If someone find exploit in system, he will be able to make any sql query and get users passwords. And hacker will be able to login into system as user, because he knows username and password
If user want restore password, make functionality for regenerating password. Never store password in plain text.
SHA256 is hash function. Mathematically it means - data can be ""hashed"" only in one way. I mean, that from hash you cannot restore data. You can read this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function about hash functions and this about http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha256 sha256
Result: If someone crack you database and get username and password, he is unable to login into system. Because hacker have only hash data and can't get exactly password for login.
As i mentioned before, hash function can be ""hash"" data only in one way. But some hackers build VERY big data massive for some predefined algorithms. I mean, that they build hash tables for passwords. Such hash tables looks something like this:


    password    hash
    ------------------
    a           some_hash1
    b           some_hash2
    ...         .....
    qwerty      some_hash3
    some_data   some_hash3 -- yes, data can have collisions. See wiki about hash functions

And if hacker hacked you database and have such table, he able to restore password. For example, hacker get for admin user hash ""some_hash3"", then hacker search such hash in hash table, find that hash ""some_hash3"" have password ""qwerty"" and ""some_data"" and hacker will try to login with such passwords.
Result: Use salt. For nowadays hackers have such tables for 6 symbols passwords. But you can ""suck"" them in very simple technic: When you store password in database, add to password some value (salt) and get from such value hash:
// somewhere in code, where creating/updating users password

$password = hash('sha256', $salt.$password);

and when you will check password, use the same logic

","sha256 hashes and other hashes are one way. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function. If you want to be able to decrypt what you write in the password fields in your database, you might want to use another approach.
Instead of creating a hash, you could encrypt with a key, that you do not share with your users. Look at http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.mcrypt.php. The key would be part of your code though, as it's symmetric encryption.
To do it really safe, try real PKI encryption (encrypt with a public key, decrypt with a private one). Look at php.net/manual/en/function.gnupg-encrypt.php or php.net/manual/en/book.openssl.php.
But as other here have said, such things are reasonably NOT done ;)

Short Background
The server is RHEL3 (yes, that is correct).  
I downloaded and built OpenSSL 0.9.8q and ensured it was the only instance of OpenSSL on the server (moving the old instance to a backup directory).  I then downloaded and built cURL 7.15.5 with the ./configure  --with-ssl=/usr/local/ssl - pointing the with-ssl to my new OpenSSL directory.
Once cURL was built I tested my connection to the resource that is requiring sha256 using cURL.  My connection test was successful using cURL.
On to my problem and question 
I downloaded httpd 2.0.59 and built it with --enable-ssl and --enable-so, but my tests did not work.  
I also tried to d/l & build httpd 2.0.63 but I was having trouble getting 2.0.63 working at all.  I then took the mod_ssl built from 2.0.63 and put it into the 2.0.59 directory...no luck either.
I feel I am missing some element that connects httpd to my newly installed OpenSSL.  What do I need to do to ensure mod_ssl is using my new version of OpenSSL on the server?
I understand I am quite a few releases behind with my httpd instances, but again, this is an old server with a specific purpose.  My only goal is to get it working with sha256, not buy a new server with the latest RHEL, etc.
Thank for any input/assistance.
","Running 
./configure --help |grep ssl

gives
--with-ssl=DIR          SSL/TLS toolkit (OpenSSL)

So just like the curl build you could try adding that.

It consists of a code given by the company as well as an API key, also given by the company, and, according to the Java example below, it also includes a GMT timestamp in minutes since epoch.  
According to the documentation it says ""The timestamp calculated as the number of minutes passed since epoch.  A GMT time zone must be used for calculating the timestamp.  If the system time of a requesting server is off by more than one minute from actual current time , the call will be rejected by the server with a 400 Bad Request code"".
I have to provide as parameters the code as well as the SHA-256 encrypted token that I create.

    try {
        lclMD = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256""); }

$time = (string)time()/60;   // to get the minutes since epoch, I have also tried it not casting it to a string
$code = 'thisisthecode';
$api_key = 'XXXXXXX';
$hash = hash('sha256', $code . $api_key . $time);

$url = ""http://api.url/user/XXXX?code=thisisthecode&token=$hash"";

For example, I learnt via hard way (try-and-error) that PHP openssl doesn't check really for OPENSSL_CONF environment variable, the only real way to use a different config file is to use the $configArray('config' => file_path) argument.
Currently I'm stuck trying to generate a CSR using SHA256 hash method. For the tests I'm using this minimal (but working) openssl.conf configuration:
distinguished_name  = req_distinguished_name
[req]
default_md          = sha256
[req_distinguished_name]
[end_req_ext]
keyUsage                = digitalSignature,keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage        = serverAuth,clientAuth

(note that the 'default_md' setting is overriden by the $configArray['digest_alg'] parameter.
I use this code for testing:
$config = array(
    'digest_alg' => ""sha256"",
    'private_key_bits' => 384,
    'config'    => ""/tmp/opensslmy.conf""
);

$dn = array(
    ""countryName"" => ""UK"",
    ""stateOrProvinceName"" => ""Somerset"",
    ""localityName"" => ""Glastonbury"",
    ""organizationName"" => ""The Brain Room Limited"",
    ""organizationalUnitName"" => ""PHP Documentation Team"",
    ""commonName"" => ""Wez Furlong""
);

$key = openssl_pkey_new($config);
if (!$key) {
    print ""Error on PKEY_NEW: "".openssl_error_string().""\n"";
    exit(1);
}

$csr = openssl_csr_new ( $dn , $key, $config );
$pem = """";
if (openssl_csr_export($csr, $pem)) {
    print $pem.""\n"";
} else {
    print ""Error on CSR_NEW: "".openssl_error_string().""\n"";

It fails:

Error on CSR_NEW: error:0E06D06C:configuration file routines:NCONF_get_string:no value

If set the initial $config array 'digest_alg' to either md5 or sha1 it works like a charm and succsfully generates a CSR with the given hash algorithm.
I also tried to remove that 'digest_alg' key from the config array and specify it exclusively in the config file (as for my experience I know even for the openssl req -new command, the -sha256 doesn't work and that is the only way to generate sha256 CSRs)

","I would recommend PBKDF2 if its available. Check this link out and see if it provides what you need. 

The difference is that:
  -  PBKDF2 by design is slow
  -  SHA256 is a good hash function; it is not slow, by design
Password hashing algorithms such as PBKDF2, bcrypt, and scrypt are meant for use with passwords and are purposefully slow. Cryptographic hashing algorithms are fast. Fast is good in most situations, but not here. Slowing down the algorithm (usually by iteration) make the attacker's job much harder. Password hashes also add a salt value to each hash to make it unique so that an attacker can not attack multiple hashes at the same time.

See this post for more info on why to pick PBKDF2.
EDIT: PBKDF2 also provides padding, so you wont give out any information about password length.

","Actually there are two different questions contained in your question.
1) Is it safe enough to store the password with SHA-256?
No, normally this is not safe enough, a SHA-* hash can be calculated very fast, so you can brute-force with 14 Giga SHA-256 per second. If your password is very strong, a single iteration of SAH-256 can be safe enough. As soon as others can determine the password, or if humans should be able to remember it, you absolutely should switch to BCrypt, PBKDF2 or SCrypt.
2) Are collisions a problem?
No, it is extremely unlikely that you find another password producing the same hash, in practise this can be ignored. There is another good answer about the likeliness of such a collision.

where the salt parameter should for example be:
$2a$12$imuoSFEBx8JJh5L9cCDJKO

The only thing I am still unclear on is the first part of the salt string '$2a$'. In my Django password field this is actually '$2b$' which according to the bcrypt page on Wikipedia is valid, yet when trying to use $2b$ in the salt passed to bcrypt (and bcryptjs too) an error is thrown. I can work around this but perhaps bcrypt just needs to be updated.

"46775391","How long to crack HMAC sha256 digest private key given data","We've built a javascript module which can be embedded in third-party webpages.  When this client module is initialized, it executes a transaction within our web application via a cross-site request.
The transaction consists of an external uuid, an email, and some additional meta properties. This message is signed with an HMAC sha256 digest, using our partner's private API key.
Ruby example:
data = {
  uuid: ""ABCAFAFDS"",
  email: ""email@gmail.com"",
  meta: {}
}

private_key = ""Qd9fe0y2ezqfae4Qj6At""
signature = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(
  OpenSSL::Digest.new(""sha256""),
  private_key,
  data.to_json
)

Within the third-party webpage, the javascript client is then initialized with the signature and the data:
new Client(signature, data).execute();
Initially, our plan was to allow the client to create a partial / incomplete transaction within our system and then require a subsequent back-end request via our REST API to confirm / finalize the transaction. Assuming that we can secure the front-end, however, it would be preferential to remove the back-end confirmation requirement.
Can we reasonably secure the client code using signed messages in this fashion? If the data and the signed message is available in the client, how difficult would it be for a bad actor to brute force the API private key length, given the length above?
","most internet traffic has signed tokens on the client these days.  All your gmail logins, facebook logins, etc do this so it is fairly standard.  I'd recommend using an existing standard (and 3rd party library) rather than roll your own token though.  This will let you leverage other people's expertise in this area.
JWT (json web token) is in common use and there are many libraries for working with JWT's.  See https://jwt.io for more information.

MY QUESTION: Is it okay if I hardcode the salt like this? I'm trying to encrypt and decrypt the password (the var password and NSString password will probably be hardcoded into something). I've read online that I need to keep my salt with my password in my db. If it's not okay if I hardcode my salt, how do I send it from iOS to node.js and be consistent with the salt? Should my iOS request look like this?
{
key:""someKeyGeneratedOnTheSpotWithRandomSalt"",
password:""somePasswordGeneratedFromKey""
}

and in my backend check the password by pulling these fields from the database?
{
key:""someKeyGeneratedWhenTheUserFirstSignedUp"",
password:""somePasswordGeneratedFromTheOrginalKeyWhenUserFirstSignedUp""
}

And then decrypt both passwords using the key and password generated from both scenarios? 
OR is it okay to have a hardcoded salt, say the username, so that way the key is always the same per user?
Basically I'm confused on whether or not I have the right idea for my encryption model. 
Thanks for any assistance. 
","Typically a random salt is used and prepended to the encrypted data. It is also common to all prepend the PBKDF2 iteration count along with a version number helps for future-proofing. Finally, skipping an iv reduces the protection of the first block and you might consider an authentication hash.
This is similar to what RNCryptor does. See RNCryptor-Spec-v3.md for a detail of a encrypted message.
Notes:
I don't understand CC_SHA256 of the salt, that shouldn't be necessary.  
NSData* outputMessage = [NSMutableData dataWithBytes:decrypted.mutableBytes 
length:bytesDecrypted];
is unnecessary, just set the length of decrypted
decrypted.length = bytesDecrypted;
and use decrypted in place of outputMessage.

But my saml plugin (passport-saml) only seems to support sha1 and sha256. The SHA256 sounds pretty close to RSAwithSHA256, but probably is not the same thing? What is the difference, and how could I use RSAwithSHA256 instead? I probably need to edit the passport-saml library, to allow the use of RSAwithSHA256 algorithm?
","I try to explain the differences, but not how to solve your issue.
RSA is a Public Key Cryptographic algorithm (Public and Private Key-Pair algorithm) and it assures Confidentiality, Authenticity (includes Identification) and Non-Repudiation.
SHA-256 is a Hashing algorithm, that produce a unique, fixed size 256-bit (32-byte) hash and it assures Message Integrity.
Hashing algorithm employed as follows, 

Sender sends message and its hash to receiver. [Hashing employed]
Receiver hash the message to generate new hash. [Hashing employed]  
Receiver check whether the new hash is equal to original hash. 


If its equal, then message integrity is confirmed and receiver process the message further. 
If its unequal, then message is tampered and receiver discard the message.


Here, how receiver confirms that message and its hash are indeed sent by expected sender? There is no authentication or identification of sender by receiver in the above case.
To do that, we have to use both Public Key Cryptography and Hashing Algorithms (like RSAWithSHA256) together to satisfy the above said requirement.
So, when employ Public Key Cryptography and Hashing Algorithms together, 

Sender sends message and its encrypted hash (using private-key of sender) to receiver. [Encryption and Hashing employed]
Receiver decrypt the encrypted hash (using public-key of sender). [Decryption and Hashing employed]
Receiver hash the message to generate new hash. [Hashing employed]
Receiver check whether the new hash is equal to decrypted hash.


If its equal, then message integrity, authenticity and
identification of sender is confirmed and receiver process the
message further.
If its unequal, then message is tampered or not sent by intended
sender (since encrypted hash is not generated with private-key of expected sender) and receiver discard the message.

","The problem here is that the C# code uses Encoding.Unicode. This is UTF-16, i.e. it returns two bytes per character, even if the character is representable in ASCII.
You need to use an equivalent of this in PHP or change your C# code to use either Encoding.UTF8 or Encoding.ASCII, depending on what PHP strings really are.

# Note 2: All constants in this pseudo code are in big endian

# Initialize variables

I naively tried doing floor (((sqrt 2) - 1) * 2^32), and then converting the returned integer to a Word32. This does not at all appear to be the right answer. I figured that by multipling by 2^32 power, I was effectively left shifting it 32 places (after the floor). Obviously, not the case. Anyway, long and the short of it is, how do I generate h[0..7] ?
","The best way to get h[0..7] is to copy the hex constants from the Wikipedia page. That way you know you will have the correct ones.
But if you really want to compute them:
scaledFrac :: Integer -> Integer

    in  floor ((s - fromInteger (floor s)) * 2^32)

My implementation
As suggested in the tutorial, firstly I get the cache information from https://cdn.ampproject.org/caches.json and then I iterate through these caches to perform update.
Simplified code for single cache (as there is just one at the moment anyways):
Main logic
String firstPartUrl = ""https://amp--frontend-dpo-styria--publishing-com.cdn.ampproject.org""
String secondPartUrl = ""/update-cache/c/s/amp-frontend.dpo.styria-publishing.com/octopus/5267614?amp_action=flush&amp_ts=1505218616""

secondPartUrl = signRequestUrl(secondPartUrl);

performRequest(firstPartUrl, secondPartUrl);

Signing function
private String signRequestUrl(String requestUrl) throws Exception {
    URL url = Resources.getResource(""rsa/private-key-pcks8.pem"");
    String privateKey = Resources.toString(url, Charsets.UTF_8);

    String signature = signSHA256RSA(requestUrl, privateKey);

    StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder(requestUrl);
    builder.append(""&amp_url_signature="");
    builder.append(signature);
    return builder.toString();
}

public static String signSHA256RSA(String input, String privateKey) throws Exception {
    // Remove markers and new line characters in private key
    String realPK = privateKey.replaceAll(""-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"", """")
            .replaceAll(""-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----"", """")
            .replaceAll(""\r\n"", """")//windows
            .replaceAll(""\n"", """");//unix

    byte[] b1 = Base64.getDecoder().decode(realPK);
    PKCS8EncodedKeySpec spec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(b1);
    KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");

    Signature privateSignature = Signature.getInstance(""SHA256withRSA"");
    privateSignature.initSign(kf.generatePrivate(spec));
    privateSignature.update(input.getBytes());
    byte[] s = privateSignature.sign();
    return Base64.getUrlEncoder().withoutPadding().encodeToString(s);
}

What I tried
I even tried to follow the signing steps in the command line, but even after that the URL I obtained returned 403.
I tried following tips from this question (making sure that I use SHA256 and setting content-type of apikey to text/plain, but it did not help)
My question
Do you know why is Google AMP still returning 403? I suspected, that there might be an issue with my Base64 encoding, because the documentation is not very clear about that, but I am not sure.
EDIT
I realized there might be a problem with the implementation of the function building secondPartUrl - specifically the timestamp. I created the timestamp using ZonedDateTime.now(), which is obviously wrong, as I am in different Timezone than UTC. However, changing it to Instant.now() did not help.

I will set the bit on the Nth position in the array to 1.

In this example, I give the equal weight to each of the 32 numbers (which seems reasonable since a hash is really not a number). But, you can give different weights to different bytes. For instance, you can give a weight of 2^31 to the first byte, and 2^30 for the second byte, etc. and normalize the final number accordingly.
Edit: You can also do the comparison for multiple bytes at a time. E.g., 16 numbers with each coming from 2 bytes, or 8 numbers with each coming from 4 bytes, etc. As you increase the ""unit"" size, the resulting final number will have a ""higher fidelity"" to the original hash value.

","The comment by Mörre contains the best answer. Simply take the first 52-bits of the hash (or any convenient 52 bits of the hash) and assign it to a javascript number. A 52-bit integer can be stored exactly as an IEEE 754 double. Then simply divide the number by 252, which should only effect the exponent bits of the number. The result is a floating point number x, 0 <= x < 1, with as much entropy as is possible given the constraints.

Why do you want to use OpenSSL random method? You could use mt_rand or array_rand
$chars = str_split($pool);
$str = ''; 
for ($i=0; $i<64; $i++) {
    // Either:
    $str .= $chars[mt_rand(0, count($chars)-1)];
    // Or:
    // $str .= $chars[array_rand($chars)];
}

"45075690","combining file chunk hash value to file fingerprint","We need a file fingerprint for all uploaded files in server. Now, sha256 is chosen to be the hash function.
For large files, each file is split into several file chunks of equal size (except the last one) to transfer. sha256 values of each file chunk are provided by clients. They are re-calculated and checked by server.
However, those sha256 values cannot be combined into the sha256 value for the whole file.
So I consider changing the definition of file fingerprint: 
For files smaller than 1GB, the sha256 value is the fingerprint.
For files larger than 1GB, it is sliced into 1GB chunks. Each chunk has its own sha256 value, denoted as s0, s1, s2 (all are integer value).
When the first chunk received:

h0 = s0

When second chunk received

h1 = SHA256(h0 << 256 + s1)

This is essentially concatenating two hash values and hash it again. This process is repeated until all chunks received. And the final value hn is used as the file fingerprint.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I have googled a lot. And read a few articles on combine_hash functions in various languages or frameworks. Different author chooses different bit mangling hash functions and most of them are said to be working well.
In my case, however, the efficiency is not a concern. But the fingerprint is stored and used as the file content identifier system-wide.
My primary concern is if the naive method listed above will introduce more conflicts than sha256 itself? 
If sha256 is not a good choice for combining hash values in our case, is there any recommendations?
","You are essentially reinventing Merkle tree.
What you'll have to do is to split your large files into equally-sized chunks (sans last fragment), compute hash for each of those chunks, and then combine them pairwise until there is a single ultimate hash value. Note that the ""root"" hash will not be equal to the hash of the original file, but that's not required to validate the integrity of the entire file.

I do not intend to make my website full PCI compliant since I'm not planning on storing Credit Card numbers (only does POST.) I want to generate a SHA 256 (one way encryption) of the first name concatenated with the last name and the credit card number and store this into my database. Would this require PCI-compliance, although it is a one way encryption? What about using the first name + last name + last 4 digits of the credit card, would it still require full PCI compliance?
Thanks,
","The fact that you're able to obtain the full card numbers at all means that you're going to be involved with PCI compliance, regardless of how you plan to generate the hash.
If you are able to hash the card numbers, and only store a hash then this will certainly make your path towards PCI compliance easier, but you will still need to work through the other issues to ensure that (eg) no rogue employee can gather the card data prior to hashing.
Hashing with SHA256 is acceptable, so long as each card has a unique salt. Your plan to use first name + last name as a salt would probably be considered acceptable here.
Ideally though you'd work with a payment gateway that captured and tokenised the card details. This would mean you never have access to the full card number and would all but eliminate your responsibilities with PCI compliance, and also mean that you could probably just use the token id in place of the card number, and no hashing required.

"49998326","javascript - Different SHA256 using the same file in Angularjs app and bash","I need to get the digest of an uploaded file in my AngularJS app, but the result digest is different from the file digest I get with bash. 
I started using jshashes, but when I saw that the resultant hash (on the web app) was different from the one which I get locally using bash I decided to move to CryptoJS. But the result is the same,the hash from the uploaded file is still different.
Here's my code:
var reader = new FileReader();    
reader.readAsBinaryString(controller.file);
controller.fileHash = CryptoJS.SHA256(reader.result).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);

As you can see the code is quite simple, just reads the uploaded file from the variable using FileReader and convert the value into a BinaryString, hash the content and finally assign the result to another controller valriable to show it in the html.
In my shell (local environment) to get the file digest I run the following command:
$ shasum -a 256 [path/to/file]

In order to upload files, i'm using ng-file-upload
What I'm missing? If anyone can help me or guide me to see the solution I will be very greatful.
Thank you in advance.
Update 1:
As @destroyer said in the comments below readAsBinaryString is deprecated and it's an asynchronous method, so here's my actual code:
var reader = new FileReader();
reader.onload = function() {
    controller.fileHash = CryptoJS.SHA256(reader.result).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
};
reader.readAsArrayBuffer(controller.file);

I tried this solution in order to convert the ArrayBuffer object into a BinaryString. But the result is still wrong.
Update 2: 
Here's an image of a console log og the object I want to hash

","readAsBinaryString is deprecated, you should use readAsArrayBuffer.
Either way, those functions start an asynchronous operation, the result of which you read inside the FileReader instance's load event.
var reader = new FileReader();    
reader.onload = function(){
  controller.fileHash = CryptoJS.SHA256(reader.result).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
};
reader.readAsArrayBuffer(controller.file);

Reflecting on our conversation in comments: the problem was that crypto-js does not operate on binary files, but on strings.
You can get a SHA256 implementation that supports ArrayBuffers directly in js-sha256.

I also figured I would use AES for the actual encryption, as it's a pretty safe standard. I'm not fixed on the encryption cipher, but I really like bcrypt. 
I'm having quite a difficult time figuring out how to actually perform the encryption. Let's say I have a passphrase and a file I'd like to encrypt. I'd assume that I essentially need to do something like this:
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from bcrypt import gensalt, hashpw
from hashlib import sha256

def encryptify(passphrase, file_name):

At the final step, it fails with a ValueError, telling me that my key must be 16, 24, or 32 bytes long. What I'm not understanding is if what I'm doing is secure and why the last step is failing. I thought that SHA256 outputs 32 characters of data? 
I'm particularly concerned about taking a bcrypt passphrase and throwing it through sha256, are there any potential security risks by doing this? I wouldn't imagine so, but then again, I'm not a cryptographer. 
","I can't comment about safety, but if you want your actual 32 bytes of SHA256, you need to call digest, not hexdigest. hexdigest returns a hexadecimal string representation (that would be 64 characters).

Does Solaris 10 have a bug with its MAC (Message Authentication Code)
tool?
Is it UTF8 or ASCII problem?
Is it a server problem, Windows / Unix?

I don't understand why I am generating a different hash to them, even though I am using the same hashing algorithm and key.
","I'll guess that the problem is newline characters.  The echo command puts a newline after ""Hello"", so if you don't want it, use ""echo -n"".  Also make sure that there is no newline character in your key file.

Here's the ""test case"" (hardcoded) that I'm trying to complete:

    return hash('sha256', $str);
}

$str1 = ""Luiz"";
$result1 = getHash($str1);

echo ""Test 2: "".$str2.""<br/>"";
echo ""Result should be: "".$expect2.""<br/>"";
echo ""Result is: "".$result2.""<br/>"";
echo ""Success? "".$success2;

The first test case works just fine, but the second one fails (because of the encoding).
I've tried everything that I could... pack, unpack, bin2Hex, mb_convert_encoding... Nothing worked.
The reason I'm trying to do this is to integrate with a third-party product, that expects a SHA-256 hash in ISO-8859-1.
Their example, in Java, goes like this:
public class TokenGenerator {
    private static String getSha256Hash(final String x) {
        try {
            MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");
            byte[] hash = md.digest(x.getBytes(""ISO-8859-1""));
            StringBuffer hexString = new StringBuffer();
            for (int i = 0; i < hash.length; i++) {
                String hex = Integer.toHexString(0xff & hash[i]);
                if(hex.length() == 1) hexString.append('0');
                hexString.append(hex);
            }
            return hexString.toString();
        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        return null;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = ""EXAMPLE_STRING"";
        System.out.println(getSha256Hash(str));
    }
}

As you can see in the example above, the Java version forces the hash to be in ISO-8859-1.
I believe that the PHP implementation only works with UTF-8, but I'm not certain.
Is there any way to do it?

"34134848","Different RSA signatures when using OpenSSL and Android","After looking through SO at similar questions, i have yet to find the answer.
I am singing a document using both 
openssl rsautl -sign ... and openssl dgst -sign ...
Both options obviously provide different outputs.
My problem is, when i sign my file on the android application using :
public byte[] signData(byte[] data, PrivateKey privateKey) {
    Signature signature = null;
    try {
        signature = Signature.getInstance(""SHA256withRSA"");
        signature.initSign(privateKey);

        return signature.sign();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return null;
    }
}

This function returns a completely different HEX string.
And the verification method on android :
byte[] sigBytes = hexStringToByteArray(signature);    
X509EncodedKeySpec spec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(keyBytes);
KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
PublicKey publicKey = keyFactory.generatePublic(spec);
Signature signCheck = Signature.getInstance(""android "");
signCheck.initVerify(publicKey);
signCheck.update(data.getBytes(""UTF-8""));
boolean isVerified = signCheck.verify(sigBytes);

Only verifies the HEX string generated by the android application.
Using the openssl commands (have tried using most of the available parameters) i cannot seem to generate the same HEX string.
FYI: i sign on both android and command line with RSA and with SHA256.
From android i get the following hex string : 0A241F28C2C4CF8A71879FAFB9F16CF4908560B76BF2DDDB7757B7C5B150C4C5EE76E86D50CC237552E08F4C4154EB83BC9CEFF0E3540B515D131E711E8CE46E4EF8DFC941E0BAE1945FDB348D66839721D27F626E9869118A7EA0D181E367A19AF4335E44256F6DAB35B23871DC95CB47CDFC489852A093F9F25FCBC451FE90EEAD5D033C65FEE1CBF67D77581BF79F27A38574879A5B903D48D0C5705E1F8F0263F262D76B08A523A27AD4D8394050CEAC2EDD92021CCDB34038699AAA49B1BFDF6823ADEFA185B036A6DF30955A152D51B64BCAF83AF79B6F7EEE783AC4217D6CE6604AF7E016C53B0D86E70AEDD4178AE039B12ED2731AD45321DEF9E394

Then takes numbers 0 to 9 and letters a to z (which is 36 total options)and rearranges them in 32 spots and saves it into a str variable, lets say its randomstring. Then chooses a random number(lets say its called correctnumber) from 0 to 99 and places that number at the end of randomstring. Finally it hashes(sha256) randomstring and if it doesnt match inputhash it repeats the process till it does. When it finally does it prints the variable correctnumber. How do you create this?
This is how you sha256 hash
import hashlib
var = 'password'
hashedWord = hashlib.sha256(var.encode('ascii')).hexdigest()

But I have know idea on the other features. Thanks
THIS DOESNT HAVE TO BE IN PYTHON. If another language is easier/better do that language. 
","If i understood your question correctly, you want to bruteforce a SHA256 hash with a character set of 32 lower alphanumeric characters, plus one or two digits. If so, this code is unlikely to solve your problem, (it's practically impossible, and python is a very bad choice for this task) but it may give you some ideas.  
You can create all the possible character combinations with itertools.product() and produce them with a generator, so it won't have a big inpact on memory.  
def string_generator(size=32):
    chars = string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits
    for i in itertools.product(chars, repeat=size):
        yield i

Now we can iterate over the items in that generator and for each item append a digit in range(100) to create possible matches. If the hash of a possible match equals the input hash, congrats you've found the correct number!  
The complete code:  
import string
import itertools
import hashlib

def string_generator(size=32):
    chars = string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits
    for i in itertools.product(chars, repeat=size):
        yield ''.join(i)

def bruteforce(hash):
    possible_strings = string_generator()
    for i in possible_strings:
        for n in range(100):
            s = i + str(n)
            print('\r' + s, end=' ')
            if hashlib.sha256(s.encode('ascii')).hexdigest() == hash:
                print('\rHash found: ' + s)

You were right that strlen needs an array of char, and not an unsigned char or byte.
The bigger problem was the design/engineering. An explicit length parameter was needed because there's no guarantee a byte array is NULL terminated like a C-string. In fact, a byte array might have a few NULLs embedded in it.

"26498110","How can we prove that a bitcoin block is always solvable?","I'm trying to implement a simple cryptocurrency similar to bitcoin, just to understand it deeply down to the code level.
I understand that a bitcoin block contains a hash of the previous block, many transactions and an reward transaction for the solver.
the miner basically runs SHA256 on this candidate block combined with an random number. As long as the first certain digits of a hash result are zeros, we say this block is solved, and we broadcast the result to the entire network to claim the reward.
but I have never seen anyone proving that a block is solvable at all. I guess this is guaranteed by SHA256? because the solution size is fixed, after trying enough inputs, you are guaranteed to hit every hash result? but how can you prove that the solution distribution of a block is even (uniform), so that you can indeed cover all hash results?
now, suppose a block is indeed always solvable, can I assume that using 64bit for the random integer is enough to solve it? how about 32bit? or I have to use an infinite bit integer?
for example, in the basiccoin project:
the code for proof of work is the following:

I'm not a python programmer, I don't know how python handles the type of the integer. there is no handling of integer overflow.
I'm trying to implement similar thing with c++, I don't know what kind of integer can guarantee a solution.
","
but how can you prove that the solution distribution of a block is even (uniform), so that you can indeed cover all hash results?

SHA256 is deterministic so if you rehash the txns it will always provide the same 256 hash.
The client nodes keep all the txn and the hashes in the merkle tree for the network clients to propagate and verify the longest possible block chain.
The merkle tree is the essential data structure for recording the hashes of previous blocks.
From there the chain of hash confirmations can be tracked from the origin (genesis) block.

When calculating the hash rate, is 1 Kilo Hash considered to be 1000 hashes or 1024 hashes?! 
If I am correct about calculating the hash rate I conclude that my PC can generate a hash rate of ~900 (h/s) using my own sha256_test() function while hashlib.sha256() outperforms this with ~300 Kh/s.
Firstly, I would like to know the mechanism behind hashlib's outstanding performance. When I read the code in hashlib.py, there isn't much code inside it and I can't understand how the hash values are computed. Is that possible to see the code behind hashlib.sha256()? 
Secondly, Is there any possibility to improve my code so that it can get close to a performance of 300 (Kh/s)? I have read about Cython, I am just not sure how much is it capable of improving such an algorithm.
Thirdly, Is that technically possible to be faster than hashlib in python?
","Well looking at hashlib.py won't help you too much to be honest, but it may give you a hint. What you have done is pure python code, whereas hashlib relies on a C implementation and that would run in circles around pure python with ease. Namely you need to look at this. So if you want to even get close to these numbers, you'd need to look into cython, C, C++ or Rust.

Here is the working code:

        {

                         .Where(x => x % 2 == 0)

}

This is how to hash a hex string SHA-256 in C#.
Thanks to all! Helped me out a lot!
","As said here before me, the method you used for conversion isn't suitable. You can use this method (taken from stackoverflow by @JaredPar):
public static byte[] StringToByteArray(string hex) {
    return Enumerable.Range(0, hex.Length)
                 .Where(x => x % 2 == 0)
                 .Select(x => Convert.ToByte(hex.Substring(x, 2), 16))
                 .ToArray();
}

You call this function with your str (which represents the HEX string), and it will return the HEX representation.
From there, you can continue with your function as written.

Can you explain why then is it so difficult to loop an unsigned int and how come is it increasingly difficult over time? Thank you.
","Because it's not just the 32bit nonce that is involved in the calculation. The 1MB of transaction data is also part of the mining input. There is then a non-trivial amount of arithmetic to arrive at the output, which then can be compared with the target.
Bitcoin mining is looping over all 4billion uints until you find a ""right"" one.
The way that difficulty is increased, is that only some of the bits of the output matter. E.g. early on the lowest 11 bits had to be some specific pattern, the remaining 21bits could be anything. In theory there would be 2million ""right"" values for each transaction block, uniformly distributed across the range of a uint. Then the ""difficulty"" is increased so that 13 bits have to be some pattern, so now there are 4x fewer ""right"" answers, so it takes (on average) 4x longer to find one.

","The task is: try different nonce values in your potential block until you reach a block having a hash value below some given threshold.
I can't find the source right now, but I'm quite sure that since the introduction of special mining ASICs the 32-bit nonce is no longer enough to keep the miners busy for the planned 10 minutes interval between blocks. They are able to compute 4 billion block hashes in less than 10 minutes.
Increasing the difficulty didn't help anymore, as that reached the point where none of the 4 billion possible nonce values gave a hash below the threshold.
So they found some additional fields in the block that are now used as nonce-extension. The principle is still the same: try different values until you reach a block with a hash below the threshold, only now it's more than 32 bits that can be varied, allowing for the threshold to be lowered beyond the former 32-bit-implied barrier.

","You can hash your expected (regular) value with Sha256 because you can't decrypt it, See decrypt sha256

SHA-256 is a cryptographic (one-way) hash function, so there is no
direct way to decode it. The entire purpose of a cryptographic hash
  function is that you can't undo it.

You can add JSR223 Sampler with the following sha256 conversion which put value in variable:
String sha256hex = org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils.sha256Hex(""myPassword"");
vars.put(""myPassword"", sha256hex);

and then you can use variable ${myPassword}

","When you call fmt.Sprintf(""%v"") and pass pointers (including struct fields which are pointers, such as the P224 Curve contains), it prints the addresses, not the values. Because the addresses will be different every run, you'll get different hashes every run.

","Turbo C is an old DOS application. As such it doesn't work with long file and directory names. Long as in, longer than 8 characters in the name and 3 characters in the extension. So, 12345678.txt would be OK, but 123456789.txt or 12345678.html would not.
You really want to move the TC directory out of C:\Program Files to C:\ or C:\Project and name all your files and directories that Turbo C (and your programs compiled with it) will access having in mind the 8.3 limitation described above.
Oh, and there should be no funky characters in 8.3 names, no spaces, non-English letters, etc etc. Use only English letters, numbers and underscores (pretty much like in C itself).
Remember to update the PATH environment variable and any path settings in Turbo C IDE to reflect the new location.
Also, it's a bad practice to put your project files into the directories, where the compiler stores its header files, any of its files for that matter.

","Simple Answer: No, there is no way.
Longer Answer: There may be a way using a Brute Force Strategy. But it would take a long time, too long to be efficient.
See, Hash in general is made to make it impossible to reverse. You convert the String into some Hash and this cannot be reversed.
You may take a look at how Hashes and Encrypting work.
https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/how-does-a-hashing-algorithm-work/
If it would be that easy, using just one line of code, the whole idea and process of hashing would be problematic.
Edit: If you want to convert a String to Hash, then to Hex and finally to ASCII your result will be the original Hash. Therefore, the idea won't work out. You cannot decrypt it this way.

Python :

The only diference happens with char + and char -. I cannot change the java code because I don't have access to it, I only know that it uses javax.crypto.Mac. However, my python code is:

hmac.new(api_secret, url, hashlib.sha256).digest().encode('base64')

The variables api_secret and url have the same input in both languages (Java and Python)
What am I missing?
","digest() returns a string, so encode is just the standard encode method. According to the list of standard encodings, specifying base64 as the encoding means that base64.encodestring will be used. The alphabet used by that function includes + and /, which are the last two characters in the standard Base64 alphabet:
>>> base64.encodestring(chr(248))
'+A==\n'

If you want an encoded string that uses - and _ instead of + and /, you need to use base64.urlsafe_b64encode:
>>> base64.urlsafe_b64encode(chr(248))
'-A=='

So you'd need to do something like:
base64.urlsafe_b64encode(hmac.new(api_secret, url, hashlib.sha256).digest())

For this to work, though, you need to check that the Java code is also producing _ instead of /, like urlsafe_b64encode.

MD5 is broken. Seeing how that has recently caused problems to hashing of dictionary keys in various languages, I would not use it for anything.
SHA-1 is more and more broken as time passes. Even though you may not need a cryptographically-secure algorithm, I would use SHA-256 unless the difference in performance is really significant, premature optimization being evil and all that.

Password Hashing - Why salt 60,000 times
Problem is these hashes do not match  if (resultHash.Equals(hashPassword))
Code 
public string BuildVerify()
{

    string password = """";
    string salt = """";
    byte[] result;


    using (var sha256 = SHA256.Create())
    {
        password = ""hovercraft"";

        // step 1: you can use RNGCryptoServiceProvider for something worth using
        var passwordHashing = new PasswordHashing();
        salt = passwordHashing.CreateRandomSalt();

        // step 2
        string hash =
           Convert.ToBase64String(sha256.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(salt + password)));

        // step 3
        result = sha256.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(salt + hash));

        // step 4
        for (int i = 0; i < 60000; i++)
        {
            result =
             sha256.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(salt + Convert.ToBase64String(result)));
        }
    }


    // TESTING  VERIFY this works ..

    string SaltAndPwd = string.Concat(password, salt);
    SHA256 sha2 = SHA256Managed.Create();
    byte[] buff = sha2.ComputeHash(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(SaltAndPwd));
    string resultHash = Convert.ToBase64String(buff);
    string hashPassword = Convert.ToBase64String(result);

    if (resultHash.Equals(hashPassword))
    {
        // perfect 
    }





    return """";

}


public class PasswordHashing
{

     public string CreateRandomSalt()
     {
        string password = """";
        password = HashPassword.CreateSalt(8) + ""="";
        password = password.Replace(""/"", ""c"");
        return password;
     }

  }

public static string CreateSalt(int size)
{
    RNGCryptoServiceProvider rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();

    byte[] buff = new byte[size];
    rng.GetBytes(buff);
    return Convert.ToBase64String(buff);
}

Update - issue 
Ok, I'm using the code from the answer, but obviously my assumptions are not correct as I cannot use my code to verify 
            // This should be stored in your DB for example along with the hash result
            var newsalt = SOPasswordHasher.GetSalt();

            // We calculate the hash then store the result. Next time you want to authenticate someone
            // You'll have to reuse the same salt and recalculate the hash then compare 
            // the stored hash with the new one
            var result = Convert.ToBase64String(SOPasswordHasher.Hash(""hovercraft"", newsalt));

            string SaltAndPwd = string.Concat(""hovercraft"", newsalt);
            SHA256 sha2 = SHA256Managed.Create();
            byte[] buff = sha2.ComputeHash(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(SaltAndPwd));
            string resultHash = Convert.ToBase64String(buff);

            if (result.Equals(resultHash))
            {
                // perfect 
            }

","Here's a reusable class that you can use (relying less on converting to base64):
class SOPasswordHasher
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Password Hasher
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name=""password"">The password you want to hash</param>
    /// <param name=""salt"">byte array of (crypto-secure) random values</param>
    /// <param name=""iterations"">Number of iterations. default is 60,000</param>
    /// <returns>Byte array containing the hashed password</returns>

    public static byte[] Hash(string password, byte[] salt, int iterations = 60000)
    {
        using (var sha256 = SHA256.Create())
        {
            byte[] passwordBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(password);

            // step 2
            byte[] hash = sha256.ComputeHash(passwordBytes.Concat(salt).ToArray());

            // step 3
            byte[] result = sha256.ComputeHash(salt.Concat(hash).ToArray());

            // step 4
            for (int i = 0; i < iterations; i++)
            {
                result =
                    sha256.ComputeHash(salt.Concat(result).ToArray());
            }

            return result;
        }
    }

    public static byte[] GetSalt(int size = 32)
    {
        byte[] salt = new byte[size];
        using (var cryptoServiceProvider = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider())
        {
            cryptoServiceProvider.GetBytes(salt);
        }
        return salt;
    }
}

and here's a usage example:
// This should be stored in your DB for example along with the hash result
var salt = SOPasswordHasher.GetSalt();

// We calculate the hash then store the result. Next time you want to authenticate someone
// You'll have to reuse the same salt and recalculate the hash then compare 
// the stored hash with the new one
var result = Convert.ToBase64String(SOPasswordHasher.Hash(""hovercraft"", salt));

","You answered your own question. The point of a hash is that it's very hard to get the original value, and that the hash changes completely when even a single bit is different. 
The 8 bytes you're looking for could be anything, dependent solely on the original value that was being hashed. If you don't know the original value, there is no way to determine what the first 8 bytes of the hash are.

hmacSHA256digest(  ""secret"".getBytes(""UTF-8""), msg) = ""244d9c89069406d40803722ec6a793e5e04c55234d9ca03039a7b505cb3f8f00""

However, if I right-pad the secret key with an arbitrary number of \0 bytes, the hash comes back as the same for different byte arrays like:

""secret""
""secret\0""
""secret\0\0""

So, JavaX HMAC SHA256 is returning the same hash, even though the byte[] array returned from getBytes(""UTF-8"") for the secret just has a few additional zeros at the end (so it's not a UTF-8 issue):
hmacSHA256digest(   ""secret"".getBytes(""UTF-8""), msg)

Calls to other JavaX methods for MD5 and plain SHA256 do not return the same hash when extra \0 s are appended to the secret, so they pass our security test case for hash uniqueness across different secrets. Is the failure of this zero-padded-secrets case with MAC/SHA256 a possible attack vector?

Since JavaX HMAC SHA256 failed this zero-padded-secrets test case that passed for the plain SHA256/MD5 algorithms mentioned above, can anyone explain the difference in the behavior and if this can be exploited? 
","This is the correct behavior of the HMAC construct, by design.
The secret key should ideally be of the size of the block size of the underlying hash algorithm. For SHA-256, the block size is 512 bits, so your key should be 64 bytes.
From the RFC 2104, if a key is longer than the block size, it will be shortened by way of passing it through the hash function and using the hash as the key. If the key is shorter than the block size, it will be extended by appending zeros.
This is the first step of the HMAC algorithm:

(1) append zeros to the end of K to create a B byte string 
  (e.g., if K is of length 20 bytes and B=64, then K will be appended with 44 zero bytes 0x00)

The recommendation from the RFC is to use keys that are at least the size of the output of the hash function, 32 bytes in your case. Even though this will still fail your test case that the key can be padded with zeroes and produce the same HMAC.

Can somebody help me to figure out what is wrong and the hashes don't match?
","Why don't you just use the PHP hash function?
echo hash('sha256','hello');

            dateregionkey = hmac.new(datekey, AWS_UPLOAD_REGION, hashlib.sha256).digest()

            signature = hmac.new(signingkey, policy, hashlib.sha256).digest()

any ideas of what is causing this? Always something like this in coding. we get nothing for free -_-

","No - what happens when your data is larger than your key, for the users whose password is ""correct horse battery staple""?
Either 

your code breaks because it tries to go for the 9th byte of an 8 byte key

or

your actual implementation (rather than your pseudo-code) ends up wrapping around to byte 0 of the key again, i.e. ECB mode, which is the one mode you should never ever use (see Adobe), since ""passwordpassword"" would then result in the same encrypted output twice, which is a huge hint.

More seriously, don't do this.  You should use PBKDF2 (for OpenSSL, that's PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC() with EVP_sha512() as the hash function - you'll need evp.h and sha.h)  to derive an encryption key of the required size from your master password and salt, and then use, say, OpenSSL to actually do the encryption using something other than ecb mode.

               new SHA256CryptoServiceProvider());
            return BytesToHex(signature);
 }

Also, how can I go the other direction, generate an RSA SHA256 signature  javascript and verify it in C# with an instance of RSACryptoServiceProvider?
","First of all, you need a library to parse an X.509 certificate. Then you need a way to validate and verify the certificate or to trust it explicitly (certificate pinning). If you cannot trust the certificate and the public key within it then verifying the signature is moot; it won't enable you to trust the data signed with it.
Parsing, validating and verifying an X.509 certificate is not an easy task, which means that you cannot do without a library. If you can pin the certificate then you can get away with just retrieving the public key from it. You could also extract the public key using different means and pin (i.e. store) the public key itself.
After you've trusted the certificate you can extract the public key from it and perform the signature verification. Note that the M$ documentation sucks and doesn't specify the signature generation algorithm. It uses PKCS#1 v1.5 padding.

For signature generation, you need to transfer the private key in a secure fashion, parse the private key and then perform the signature generation.

StackOverflow is not here to do the work for you so I just provided the steps you need to follow.

"46555379","Golang crypto/sha256 - same inputs produce different outputs","I have a problem with Golang's crypto/sha256 package. I am sending the same input to sha256.Sum256 two separate times, and the output is different each time.
My code is the following:
//Run the HMAC-SHA256 on the given kmac and message and return the generated MAC tag
func PCSSHA256(kmac []byte, message []byte) [32]byte {

    tohashinner := make([]byte, 64)
    for i := 0; i < 64; i++ {
            tohashinner[i] = kmac64[i] ^ 0x36
    }
    tohashouter := make([]byte, 64)
    for i := 0; i < 64; i++ {
            tohashouter[i] = kmac64[i] ^ 0x5c
    }
    tohashinnerwmess := append(tohashinner, message[0:]...)
    firsthashval := sha256.Sum256(tohashinnerwmess)

    fmt.Printf(""tohashinner in || bounds:\n||%s||\n"", tohashinner)
    fmt.Printf(""tohashouter in || bounds:\n||%s||\n"", tohashouter)
    fmt.Printf(""tohashinnerwmess in || bounds:\n||%s||\n"", tohashinnerwmess)
    fmt.Printf(""firsthashval after Hex Encode in || bounds:\n||%s||\n"", hex.EncodeToString(firsthashval[:]))

    tag := sha256.Sum256(append(tohashouter, firsthashval[0:]...))

    fmt.Printf(""Input message in || bounds:\n||%s||\n"", message)
    fmt.Printf(""Input kmac in || bounds:\n||%s||\n"", kmac)
    fmt.Printf(""Tag generated by PCSSHA256 after Hex Encode in || bounds:\n||%s||\n"", hex.EncodeToString(tag[:]))
    return tag
}

Below is the fmt.Printf output for the first run:

In both of the outputs, everything is the same except for firsthashvalue and the resulting tag. Since tohashinnerwmess (a variable I'm using solely to figure out what's going wrong) is equivalent in both cases and it is the only thing being fed into sha256.Sum256, I'm confused as to why firsthashvalue is different for the two inputs.
I'm pretty sure that sha256.Sum256 is deterministic and is expected to return the same output for a given input - tested this in the Go Playground, and indeed it returned the same thing - so I assume the problem lies either with my code or my understanding of Sum256's inner workings. If anyone could explain what I am doing wrong, that would be greatly appreciated. 
Thank you.
EDITS:
- On the first run, the message input to the PCSSHA256 function is directly read from a file using ioutil.ReadFile() while on the second run, an encrypted message is first processed block by block via AES and then passed to PCSSHA256.
","Answer: It is an issue with my code. My message is padded by 8 extra 0s in the second case when converted to Hex - this padding is not visible when printed as a string.

","Expanding on aliasm2k's answer, you probably want to do it more like this:
EDIT: Changed answer slightly based on comments discussion
I think I was a bit unclear on what you were asking for in the comments.  
 try {
     $result = $Coinbase->sendMoney($bitcoinaddress, '0.00000555', 'this is a test');
 catch(Exception $e) {
     echo $e->getMessage(); 
     exit;   //optional but you probably want to quit here and show the user
             //the original form along with the error message to fix 
 }

This is just going to echo ""Please enter a valid email or bitcoin address."" You wont get all of that other info because you are catching the exception and  just displaying the message. 
Possible error messages are listed here.
Also, if I can give you a slightly off-topic hint:
If you want to find info about a particular address that has been used, try the blockchain block explorer api. 
And to simply check if an address is valid, you need to calculate that in your code or find a library function to do so. There's no master-list of addresses that an api would have. The last 4 bytes of the address are a double-sha-256 checksum of the preceding characters. That's sort-of an imprecise description I'm giving you, by the way,  but check here for a working php example

openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key private_key.pem -out public_key.cer -days 3650

Next, get public key from file:

        Enumeration<?> e = primitive.getObjects();
        BigInteger v = ((DERInteger) e.nextElement()).getValue();

        int version = v.intValue();
        if (version != 0 && version != 1) {

Then encrypt
private static byte[] encrypt(String text, PublicKey key) {

        }
}

So I want to do same encode password and salt but with random values, and before encode it I want to know what password is. How can I do it?
I have something like this:
 public string EncryptPasswordRandom()
 {
         var password = // some random password, how can I generate it?
         var salt = // how can I generate it?

         using (var sha256 = SHA256.Create())
         {
              var saltedPassword = string.Format(""{0}{1}"", salt, password);
              byte[] saltedPasswordAsBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(saltedPassword);
              return Convert.ToBase64String(sha256.ComputeHash(saltedPasswordAsBytes));
         }
 }

Help is very appreciated. Regards

Note: I have a web application who works well, I can register user and
  login, this random password is for recovery password  and made one
  random

","System.Web.Membership has a GeneratePassword method that will do the job.
As for randomly generating the salt Guid.New() should work.
This answer addresses generating the salt in a high entropy fashion.
It might help if you explain what you are attempting to accomplish as well. At face value it looks like an odd requirement unless this is in a test of some sort.

","The problem is not in the source file you downloaded, but the fact that you need to make 'an application'. Eclipse cannot compile 'just some functionality' unless you instruct it to build a library. You will have to provide a WinMain / main function so that Windows knows what to do when you start the application.
That is what the compiler is complaining about, there is no main() functions it can compile into the application!
Easiest way to start is to start a Generic C Application in Eclipse and then add this sha2 source file and header to that project. The Generic C application project already has a main function you can work from..

"32625570","Verifying Python generated SHA256 strings using Ruby","I'm converting a Python project to Rails, both of them uses the same database and I'm trying to use Ruby to verify the passwords that are saved using Python library called passlib.hash.sha256_crypt. I want to use Ruby to verify the user input whether it is the valid password compared to the saved password using any Ruby library but couldn't find any suitable gem for that.
Example password saved in SHA256 using Python Passlib library:
$5$rounds=110000$4QB3mR7z8SVQwVDt$1jT2mdn9XHRD.O8gsCJXoUTDWJSLrY09uD8KZp78ou6
which is password
The gems that I've found are:

Ruby Digest library
: not generating in the format of $5$.....
Unix Crypt : generate digests in relevant format but unable to verify the result
Gibberish : only advance in AES mode decryption, not generating in the format of $5$.....

Unix Crypt is the most relevant solution but the generated digest for the string ""password"" is different from the Python generated. I tried to remove the rounds from the saved digest and verify it but it failed, I think it's because they are using different rounds to generate the digest.
[7] pry(main)> UnixCrypt::SHA256.build(""password"")
=> ""$5$qbpSpYyYoTCr0q4G$/jyjVRgg3Y4vQj39f9OWwUQhKOh70bTB50jH7WfsZl2""
[10] pry(main)> UnixCrypt.valid?(""password"", ""$5$rounds=110000$4QB3mR7z8SVQwVDt$1jT2mdn9XHRD.O8gsCJXoUTDWJSLrY09uD8KZp78ou6"")
=> false
[11] pry(main)> UnixCrypt.valid?(""password"", ""$5$4QB3mR7z8SVQwVDt$1jT2mdn9XHRD.O8gsCJXoUTDWJSLrY09uD8KZp78ou6"")
=> false

Based on @Niel Slater's comment, I used UnixCrypt's build to rehash ""password"", and it's still different from the Python hashed string.
[81] pry(main)> UnixCrypt::SHA256.build(""password"", ""4QB3mR7z8SVQwVDt"", 110000)
=> ""$5$rounds=110000$4QB3mR7z8SVQwVDt$hF/KhMEITeydgv58fXf2brManFYwhhy.dMqGnrkrLb1""

Any workaround on this, or is there any simpler method to verify the user password in Ruby? I'm not familiar with encryption, any detailed explanation on rounds and digests are welcomed too.
","Your problem is that you think $5$rounds=110000$4QB3mR7z8SVQwVDt$1jT2mdn9XHRD.O8gsCJXoUTDWJSLrY09uD8KZp78ou6 is a hash of password for some reason. It is not.
In Python:
hash = sha256_crypt.encrypt(""password"", rounds=110000, salt='4QB3mR7z8SVQwVDt')
# '$5$rounds=110000$4QB3mR7z8SVQwVDt$hF/KhMEITeydgv58fXf2brManFYwhhy.dMqGnrkrLb1'

In Ruby:
UnixCrypt::SHA256.build(""password"",'4QB3mR7z8SVQwVDt', 110000 )
# ""$5$rounds=110000$4QB3mR7z8SVQwVDt$hF/KhMEITeydgv58fXf2brManFYwhhy.dMqGnrkrLb1""

Also:
UnixCrypt.valid?(""password"", 
   ""$5$rounds=110000$4QB3mR7z8SVQwVDt$hF/KhMEITeydgv58fXf2brManFYwhhy.dMqGnrkrLb1"")
# => true

So the Ruby gem unix-crypt is the simplest choice for your problem, as it matches the Python library passlib with the least effort (no need to figure out the details, just use the same params and string values throughout).

","i have been researching a couple of days (5+), i havent been able to find a solution, i am using wse 3.0 and for that is pretty much imposible.
so if you are using wse 2.0 or 3.0, the answer is no, you cant change the inner cyrpto provider, or even subclass the securitytoken class and override the signatureformatter getter.

"27751402","Progress Bar With SHA256 Hashing in ANSI C","For a project that I am working on right now, I was wondering how I could add a progress indicator to the Openssl SHA256 hashing function. I will be working with some large files (1-10+ GB) and would like to be able to see the progress completed versus left. I have implemented the Stack Overflow questions here and here, and have the SHA256 hash generating working correctly (it only lacks a progress indicator).
I am fairly new to C, so this will be a learning experience for me. I thought that I might be able to use fread or SHA256_Update somehow, but I am having trouble understanding exactly how I would get a response of how much of the file has been read. 

char _genSHA256Hash(char *path, char outputBuffer[65])

  sha256_hash_string(hash, outputBuffer);

  //fclose(file);
  //free(buffer);

void sha256_hash_string (unsigned char hash[SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH], char outputBuffer[65]) {

    for(i = 0; i < SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH; i++)

    }

    outputBuffer[64] = 0;

","You already have information about how much of the file has been read, you just need to account for it:
int bytesRead = 0;
int totRead = 0;
while((bytesRead = fread(buffer, 1, bufSize, file))) {
    totRead += bytesRead;
    ...

All you need now is the total size of the file. You can get this with:
struct stat sb;
if (stat(path, &sb) == -1) {
    perror(""stat"");
    return 0;
}

totRead keeps a running counter; bytesRead is reset each time through the loop. Then, in your loop, totRead / sb.st_size represents the percentage of your hashing progress.

You have hashed your passwords not encrypted.
You need also to save the salt in some place. if not you cannot authenticate.

After that, when user send their pass you can use the same function GenerateSHA256Hash() to check if user pass + salt return same hash like you have previously saved.

","To authenticate users, you must store the salt with the user record. You do not need to encrypt the salt. 
When someone tries to log in, you retrieve both the salt and the hash for the user. You use the salt to hash the attempted password and you compare this new hash with the hash you had saved for the user. If you combine the same salt with the same input in the same way as the original, and use the same hashing algorithm, you'll end up with the same hash, and so you can authenticate users by comparing the hashes.
I strongly urge you, though, to avoid writing this code yourself at all. It's just so easy to write authentication code that seems to work correctly — let's good attempts in, and seems to keep bad attempts out —  but is subtly flawed in ways such that you come back a year later and find out you were hacked six months ago. 
Instead, rely as much as possible on whatever solution is provided for your platform. If there isn't one availalbe, find a pre-existing library. Security and authentication code is one thing you want to leave to experts.

Is there another way to verify locally built Docker images? Some best practice maybe?
","From docs:

By default, docker pull pulls images from Docker Hub. It is also
  possible to manually specify the path of a registry to pull from

You can start a private docker registry on you localhost with the following command:
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2

Say your image name isubuntu Then push image to that specific registry with:
docker push localhost:5000/ubuntu

In your Dockerfile you can use:
From localhost:5000/ubuntu

How can my TableView display this kind of scrambled String?
@FXML
protected void loadFile()
{
allScrambledVotes.clear();
HashTable hashTable = new HashTable(txtPath.getText());
LinkList[] allVotes = hashTable.getArray();
Scrambler scrambler = new Scrambler();
int k = 0;
for (LinkList vote : allVotes)
{
    for (int j = 0; j < vote.getSize(); j++)
    {
    Vote v = vote.findVote(j);
    scrambler.put(k, v);
    allScrambledVotes.add(scrambler.get(k));
    System.out.println(allScrambledVotes.get(k));
    k++;
    }
}
table.setItems(allScrambledVotes);
System.out.println(""Hello World"");
} 

I forget my loadFile method. I load the data from a hashtable with my own functions. The error occurs after the Hello World sysout.
","The digest() method returns an array of bytes: these are not the ascii values of the string representation of the digest. You're getting the error (I think) because JavaFX is unable to render a character for some of the byte values you have.
Instead of
cryptedName = new String(messageDigest.digest());
return cryptedName;

try something along the lines of
StringBuilder cryptedName = new StringBuilder();
for (byte b : messageDigest.digest()) {
    cryptedName.append(String.format(""%02x"", b));
}
return cryptedName.toString();

the salt value stored in the database is truncated because the varchar value is low increase the varchar value of your salt column to 200-300 something and than try this.. it will run fine.

","Actually i didn't see why this should not work, the code you have shown, should produce the same value, maybe you could check, whether the salt you read from the database is really the same as you wrote to the database.
Nevertheless i would not engourage to go further on this route, there are quite a lot of problems here.

First of all, SHA-256 is not a good choice to hash passwords, instead use a slow key-derivation function like BCrypt.
You should not escape input data without need, and if you need to escape them, you should do it only for the specific target system (htmlspecialchars and mysql_real_escape_string make no sense if you are going to calculate a hash anyway).
To create a salt, you use the random source, that is good. Using a hash afterwards creating the salt, will in no way make the salt more random.
There is no need to have two separate fields for password and salt in the database. Php's crypt() function will create a hash value, that already contains the salt.

I would invite you to read this tutorial about hashing passwords, you will find a PHP example too, and i would recommend to use the phpass library.

In the above example, hash and t have different values. Why is this?
","hash is not an UTF-8 encoded byte array, just some random bytes. Note: not all byte arrays are valid as UTF-8, UTF-8 has its own rules. Therefore, it cannot necessarily be decoded into a string. (Specifically, invalid bytes are usually decoded into a question mark in .NET.)
You can try a regular 8-bit encoding which supports all possible byte arrays, like ISO-8859-1. Of course you will still get garbage when you try to read that as a string, but it should work back and forth.
If you are trying to transfer a random byte array as a string, I suggest you use BASE-64 encoding, which converts byte arrays to an ASCII string, which should be safe in all circumstances.

","Forge library usually works with Uint8. converting content to Uint8Array should works properly

    var contents = e.target.result;

    var array = callback(binary)

","Unless you're prepared to crack their password, no, you can't convert as SHA2-256 hash to an MD5 one. You need to know the content that generated the hash in the first place.
When migrating from one hashing type to another the best plan is to normalize all your password hashes into a consistent form first and the Modular Crypt Format is the most widely supported.
If you can wrangle your old hashes into that form then you should be able to use them with password_verify. You can also update user passwords as they log-in by re-writing them with password_hash which uses Bcrypt by default.
Over time you can stomp out old SHA2-256 and MD5 passwords and limit your exposure.

"30155648","SHA-256 on the database side","I'm making a mobile app for tv series. Basically like a tracker, to know what episodes to watch and when. And I wanted to store the information like episodes watched, user shows on a database. (the info about shows I get from a rest api)
So the thing is I don't find the need to have a server here, I just don't know what it should do.
And the problem is I'd like to make the database secure. And from what I've read the best practice is to create a salt using a cryptographically strong random number generator and prepend it to the password and then hash the whole thing using a hash algorithm, for example the SHA-256.
Then I store a hashed password and the salt in the database, and when I want to check if the password is correct, just hash it again and compare to the one in database.
So I have a special class in Java that can create such a salt, and all I needed to know is where and how to hash the whole thing. And what is what I'm asking about. I would not like to create a server that would just hash passwords.
Also another thing is how to go about implementing auto-login, which I also wanted to add once I figured this out.
I hope it's clearer now what I want to accomplish here.
","Sounds like you're building a mobile app that stands alone, ie doesn't talk to a server.
You want the app to be password protected (even if their phone already is), and you want to store this password hashed, so that the pwd cannot be recovered on say a lost then rooted phone.
SHA256 is a fine hash but what you want is a real slow hash. Use bcrypt, PBKDF2, or scrypt.
The salt is not a secret.
When the user creates their account, create the salt, hash the pwd with the salt and store the password and salt somewhere. Each time the user logs in, get the salt, hash the password the same as before, and compare to saved password. If same, user authenticates.
You don't need to store the pwd in sqlite. It's probably easier just to store it in a text file.

Answers From the comments
Do not encrypt passwords, when the attacker gets the DB he will also get the encryption key. Just using a hash function is not sufficient and just adding a salt does little to improve the security. Iterate over an HMAC with a random salt for about a 100ms duration and save the salt with the hash. Use a function such as password_hash, PBKDF2, Bcrypt or similar functions. The point is to make the attacker spend a lot of time finding passwords by brute force

Iterate over an HMAC with a random salt for about a 100ms duration and save the salt with the hash. Use a function such as password_hash, PBKDF2, Bcrypt or similar functions. The point is to make the attacker spend a lot of time finding passwords by brute force

Authorize.Net is phasing out the MD5 based transHash element in favor of the SHA-256 based transHashSHA2. The setting in the Merchant Interface which controls the MD5 Hash option will be removed by the end of January 2019, and the transHash element will stop returning values at a later date to be determined.  
We have identified that you have this feature configured and may be relying on MD5 based transHash in transaction responses for verifying the sender is Authorize.Net.

I use the http POST method to submit my transaction and do the MD5 check on the response using a bit of C code that was written long ago. What should I do with my POST to transition and how to handle the 'transHasSHA2' stuff? Currently in C I am linking libssl and using the MD5_ functions.
Damn, I did this all so long ago, and a January 2019 deadline is awfully close!
","The email sent by Authorze.Net included a link to a page that explains how to transition to the new hash:

Transaction Hash Upgrade Guide
Authorize.Net is phasing out the MD5 based transHash element in favor of the SHA-512 based transHashSHA2. The setting
  in the Merchant Interface which controls the MD5 Hash option will be
  removed by the end of January 2019, and the transHash element will
  stop returning values at a later date to be determined.
When you receive a transaction response from Authorize.Net, it
  includes the transHashSHA2 element.  transHashSHA2 contains
  the HMAC-SHA512 hash that Authorize.Net generated for the transaction.
  To use it, construct a HMAC-SHA512 hash using your Signature Key,
  converted to byte format, as the HMAC key, and a message constructed
  from your API Login ID, the transaction ID, and the transaction
  amount. Compare your hash result with transHashSHA2. If the two
  values match, the transaction response came from Authorize.Net.
Note: The value of transHashSHA2 will be null if you do not
  generate the Signature Key first.
To use the Signature Key to validate the value of transHashSHA2:  
Step 1. Generate a Signature Key and store it in a secure location on your server.
Step 2. Convert the Signature Key into a byte array.
Step 3. Create a message string that starts with a caret (""^""), followed by the following three fields delimited by carets, and
  terminated with another caret:
•    The API Login ID that you send in createTransactionRequest in
  the name element.
•    The transaction ID that we send in createTransactionResponse
  in the transId element.
•    The transaction amount that we send in
  createTransactionResponse in the amount element.
For example, if your API Login ID is ""ANet123"", the value of
  transId is ""20987654321"", and the value of amount is ""9.99"", the message string would look like this:
^ANet123^20987654321^9.99^
Step 4. Use HMAC-SHA512 to hash the byte array form of the Signature Key from Step 2 with the message string from Step 3.
Step 5. Compare the value of transHashSHA2 with the output from the HMAC-SHA512 hash mentioned in Step 4.

After looking I came across this code:
public String sha256(String base) {
    try{        
        MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");
        byte[] hash = digest.digest(base.getBytes(""UTF-8""));

","One concern is that this:
""1234567890"".getBytes()

and this
stringToSign.getBytes()

don't specify the character encoding used (e.g. UTF8). It'll be dependent on your platform or JVM settings, and that may be different from what you want (which is, I suspect, UTF8). I would prefer to use the getBytes(CharSet) variant.

I tried the following too:
NSString *s8 = [NSString stringWithCharacters:(const char *)cHMAC length:sizeof(cHMAC)];

Output is arbitrary chars.
Explanation: 
Both inputs are same for secret and data. I verified with cKey and cData. After I am getting the bytes in obj c into ""cHMAC"". Making it a NSData and then getting the base64 string is not generating the same string.
Question:
What did I miss out? Any insight helps.

","
The data is obviously not sent down the line to the HSM, but what exactly is?

Encrypting all data through a local HSM or even KSM directly woudn't be very efficient.  So what KMS or your local HSM should encrypt is the encryption key.
In KMS or your local HSM you can generate a master service/purpose key. 
You can encrypt data using a random encryption key and then encrypt the data encryption key using the KMS / HSM (with the service key). Just store the master key id, encrypted data key and IV next to the encrypted content.

"55017754","Mask information in CSV file using sha256 in Python","I have a CSV file that contains Name, Address, and Password. I want to mask Address and password using sha256 in Python.
Here is what I have tried so far:
import hashlib
import csv

def hash_pw(input_file_name, output_file_name): 
    hash_lookup = {} 

    with open(input_file_name, newline='') as f_input, open(output_file_name, 'w', newline='') as f_output: 
        csv_input = csv.reader(f_input)
        csv_output = csv.writer(f_output) 

        for user, hash in csv_input: 
            csv_output.writerow([user, hash_lookup[hash]]) 

hash_pw('input.csv', 'output.csv')

I don't know how to specify to mask only address and password columns?
Any help would be appreciated. Thank you   
","First of all, as your input.csv file contains three items, your loop needs to read three items. You could then have a function that takes text and returns the hashed values. You can then use this function to hash the address and password fields.
I suggest returning the hex digest so that it can be easily written to your output.csv file:
import hashlib
import csv

def hash(text):
    return hashlib.sha256(text.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()


def hash_file(input_file_name, output_file_name): 
    hash_lookup = {} 

    with open(input_file_name, newline='') as f_input, open(output_file_name, 'w', newline='') as f_output: 
        csv_input = csv.reader(f_input)
        csv_output = csv.writer(f_output) 
        csv_output.writerow(next(csv_input))    # Copy the header row to the output

        for user, address, password in csv_input: 
            csv_output.writerow([user, hash(address), hash(password)]) 

hash_file('input.csv', 'output.csv')

So if your input.csv contained the following:
Name,Address,Password
Fred,1 Rock Close,MyPassword
Wilma,1 Rock Close,Password1234

The output.csv would then look like:
Name,Address,Password
Fred,fc3b252cf37b3d247a38068a5f58cc8fc6b9ea3e938831c6d90f8eb9e923d782,dc1e7c03e162397b355b6f1c895dfdf3790d98c10b920c55e91272b8eecada2a
Wilma,fc3b252cf37b3d247a38068a5f58cc8fc6b9ea3e938831c6d90f8eb9e923d782,a0f3285b07c26c0dcd2191447f391170d06035e8d57e31a048ba87074f3a9a15

As you can see, the values for the address are the same. The header row can be copied first before hashing the remaining rows.

"31009358","TLS MAC message verification","I'm developing a SSL de-cipher in python but I'm having some problems on HMAC verification:
I've extracted all keyring related material (client IV, MAC, Key and Server IV, MAC, key). 
When I receive the first Application_Data message (0x17), I am able to decrypt it, but unable to verify message integrity.
On RFC 2246 (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt), tells:

The MAC is generated as:
   HMAC_hash(MAC_write_secret, seq_num + TLSCompressed.type +
                 TLSCompressed.version + TLSCompressed.length +
                 TLSCompressed.fragment));

where ""+"" denotes concatenation.
seq_num
         The sequence number for this record.
hash
         The hashing algorithm specified by
         SecurityParameters.mac_algorithm.

Taking this as an example:
Chosen cipher_suite is TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256

client_mac = ""some random stuff""
message_type = 0x17
message_version = 0x0303
encrypted_message_length = 1184 (IV|Message|MAC|Offset)
decrypted_message_length = 1122 (removing IV, MAC and offset)
message = ""some message of length 1122""


client_mac is extracted from keyring_material
message_type is 0x17, because as an Application_data message type, the correct value should be 0x17
message version is 0x0303 as it's TLS 1.2
message length is 1122, removing preceding IV, offset and MAC verification, message, gets a final length of 1122
seq_number is 1 as it's the first message

HMAC_SHA256 calculation, in python, is as follows:
import hashlib
import hmac
hmac.new(<client_mac>,label+message,hashlib.sha256).digest()

My question is, how do I calculate label?
As RFC mentions, ""+"" denotes concatenation, but concatenation of what

HEX values converted to string


""1"" + ""17"" + ""0303"" + ""462""

INT values converted to strings


""1"" + ""23"" + ""771"" + ""1122""


And other thing to mention, TLSCompressed.version means:

0x0303
771
""1.2""
""12""
""TLS 1.2""

In this maillist (http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg14357.html) I found a supposed clarification of MAC values, 

   MAC(MAC_write_key, seq_num +
       TLSCipherText.type +
       TLSCipherText.version +
       length of ENC(content + padding + padding_length) +
       IV +
       ENC(content + padding + padding_length));

where the length is encoded as two bytes in the usual way.

but it makes no sense to me, because it's useless to re-encode decrypted values to check to compute MAC. And from last line ""where length is encoded as two bytes in the usual way"", does it means that I should use 

struct.pack(""!H"",length)

Then remove ""\x"" and use this value? or should I encode this value in HEX and then concatenate it?
I'm a bit lost, because RFC are not clear about how values should be used.
I've been trying several combinations (even brute forcing), but none of them worked, I hope you can light my way.
","Well, after diggin' a bit I've managed to solve the issue.
RFC 5246, in section 6.2.3.1 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-6.2.3.1) 

The MAC is generated as:
  MAC(MAC_write_key, seq_num +
                        TLSCompressed.type +
                        TLSCompressed.version +
                        TLSCompressed.length +
                        TLSCompressed.fragment);

where ""+"" denotes concatenation.

But it does not points the data size, either representation format (hex, string...).
The way every field must be represented is as follows:

seq_num:

Description: A int counter, starting in 0, which will be incremented every frame received or sended. For a TCP Session, two seq_numbers must be used, one for the server and other for the client, incrementing everytime each of them sends a frame.
Representation: This value must be represented as Unsigned Long Long with 8 bytes
Representation example: 
struct.pack(""!Q"",seq_num)

TLSCompressed.type

Description: This field is extracted from TLS Record layer (the encrypted payload). For example, if it's an Application Data frame, we must use 0x17.
Representation: This value must be represented as Signed Char, with 2 bytes.
Representation example:
struct.pack(""!b"",TLSCompressed.type)

TLSCompressed.version

Description: This field is also extracted from TLS Record layer (the encrypted payload). For example, if the frame is transferred using TLS 1.2, we must use it's hex representation 0x0303.
Representation: This value must be represented as Unsigned Short, with 2 bytes.
Representation example:
struct.pack(""!H"",TLSCompressed.version)

TLSCompressed.length

Description: This field represents the actual length of the decrypted payload.
Representation: This value must be represented as Unsigned Short, with 2 bytes.
Representation example:
struct.pack(""!H"",TLSCompressed.length)

TLSCompressed.fragment

Description: This field is the actual **decrypted payload.
Representation: This value must be represented as a string


As a python example, the HMAC hashing will be as follows for our previous example:
hmac_digest = hmac.new(mac_secret,'',digestmod=hashlib.sha256)
hmac_digest.update(struct.pack('!QbHH',seq_num,TLSCompressed.type,TLSCompressed.version, len(decrypted)))
hmac_digest.update(decrypted)
hmac_digest.digest()

The default hash used by openssl enc for password-based key derivation
  changed in 1.1.0 to SHA256 versus MD5 in lower versions.
  https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/344150/why-can-one-box-decrypt-a-file-with-openssl-but-another-one-cant/344586#344586

By default, CryptoJS uses MD5 for its key derivation. OpenSSL used MD5, but now in OpenSSL versions >=1.1.0 it's using SHA256.
So if I pass -md md5 to OpenSSL, CryptoJS is compatible:
echo ""Hello World"" | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -md md5 -pass pass:""Secret Passphrase"" -e -base64

output: U2FsdGVkX19aufvaqQQ89scaApBos6oFCyqPj7IKUFk=
CryptoJS:
CryptoJS.AES.decrypt('U2FsdGVkX19aufvaqQQ89scaApBos6oFCyqPj7IKUFk=', 'Secret Passphrase').toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);

output: ""Hello World""

But now if I want to use SHA256 instead of MD5 (removing the -md md5):
echo ""Hello World"" | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:""Secret Passphrase"" -e -base64

output: U2FsdGVkX1/5LLkFkTpawh1im4a/fCco5hS42cjn/fg=
CryptoJS:
CryptoJS.AES.decrypt('U2FsdGVkX1/5LLkFkTpawh1im4a/fCco5hS42cjn/fg=', 'Secret Passphrase').toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);

output: null
How do I tell CryptoJS to use SHA256 instead of MD5 for its key derivation?
","It seems that CryptoJS ""as-is"" does not provide this flexibility. This is because the use of MD5 is hard coded into the function used to derive the key from the passphrase. You can see it happening here in OpenSSLKdf:
var key = EvpKDF.create({ keySize: keySize + ivSize }).compute(password, salt);

KDF stands for Key Derivation Function, and no digest is provided when it is created. That EvpKDF.create() in itself does have the possibility for different types of digests, as you can see in its configuration options:
        cfg: Base.extend({
            keySize: 128/32,
            hasher: MD5,
            iterations: 1
        }),

It also shows that MD5 is the default.
All of this implies that the decryption will work if you modify that first line to the following:
var key = EvpKDF.create({ keySize: keySize + ivSize, hasher: C_algo.SHA256 }).compute(password, salt);

and indeed, after editing (as a test) that file cipher-core.js in your locally installed module, your last line of code does result in the desired Hello World.
The only way I see to reproduce this without modifying the CryptoJS module itself is by duplicating a whole chunk of code from the module into your own code.

I'm building the site in PHP and would like to keep the passwords the same for their customers. In order to do that, I need to make their hashing function the same as mine. I'm having a bit of trouble since I don't know much about C#.
Here are the C# functions that I've found that are useful to setting the password when I decompiled the code:
string salt = ui.UserGUID.ToString();
if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(UserInfoProvider.UserSaltColumn))
  salt = ui.GetStringValue(UserInfoProvider.UserSaltColumn, string.Empty);
ui.SetValue(""UserPassword"", (object) UserInfoProvider.GetPasswordHash(userPassword, stringValue, salt));

The GetPasswordHash function will return this:
return SecurityHelper.GetSHA2Hash(password + salt + UserInfoProvider.PasswordSalt);

The GetSHA2Hash function is where I think my problems are. Here's the one-liner of the function:
return ValidationHelper.GetStringFromHash(new SHA256Managed().ComputeHash(Encoding.Default.GetBytes(inputData)));

And finally, here's the GetStringFromHash function:
StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
  foreach (byte hashByte in hashBytes)
    stringBuilder.Append(string.Format(""{0:x2}"", (object) hashByte));
  return stringBuilder.ToString();

In the first code, stringValue is sha256 which pulls the second like of code. The salt is stored in the database so I know what that value is, and I know a non-encrypted password to test. In the second piece of code, the ""salt"" variable is null so it's only hashing the password and the salt in the database.
I have tried several different pieces of PHP code to try to get the passwords to match, but nothing so far. Here's a few of the things I've tried:
$hash = hash('sha256', ord(""Password"" . ""The Salt""));
$hash = hash('sha256', ""Password"" . ""The Salt"");
$hash = (hash('sha256', mb_convert_encoding(""Password"" . ""The Salt"",""UTF-8""), true));

I know the last piece of code is formatting the string into hexadecimal, but I am at a loss right now. I'm hoping it's a simple fix. I spent the better part of yesterday tracking down all the functions and trying to get it to work before bringing it here.
Thanks in advance. 

Solved. Apparently, the GUID was being lowercased in the first line: 
string salt = ui.UserGUID.ToString(); 

and that was causing the issues to be wrong. I created an online fiddle and when I was getting the same output as PHP, I knew there was something was was being changed. Looked into it a little more and then we found the problem. Here's the final PHP in case it helps future people:
$hash = hash('sha256', ""Password"" . strtolower(""The Salt""));

I understand how hashing and salts work for the most part, but I don't understand how functions match passwords. For example, here is part of passlib's documentation:
>>> # import the hash algorithm
>>> from passlib.hash import sha256_crypt

>>> # generate new salt, and hash a password
>>> hash = sha256_crypt.encrypt(""toomanysecrets"")
>>> hash
'$5$rounds=80000$zvpXD3gCkrt7tw.1$QqeTSolNHEfgryc5oMgiq1o8qCEAcmye3FoMSuvgToC'

>>> # verifying the password
>>> sha256_crypt.verify(""toomanysecrets"", hash)
True
>>> sha256_crypt.verify(""joshua"", hash)
False

On the 4th line, it mentions generating a new salt, but as far as I can tell the salt is never stored alongside the password.
Why can I can store the hashed password as a string in a database and verify it later without providing a salt? 
","Per the documentation:

An sha256-crypt hash string has the format $5$rounds=rounds$salt$checksum

The salt (in your case 'zvpXD3gCkrt7tw.1') is stored within the string itself; that's why it doesn't need to be stored separately.

This will return the substring of the original string that starts at position start and has length length. 
Therefore, giving start a value of 0 will yield the first length characters of the original string.
However, if I may make a suggestion, assuming that it is within your control, do not create salts this way. Use a completely random sequence of characters, preferably created using a secure random generator, and store it alongside the username and hashed password. Also, do make your salt fairly long.

"41113797","Does adding an explicit column of SHA-256 hash for a CLOB field improve the search(exact match) performance on that CLOB field","We have a requirement to implement a table(probably an orable db table or a mssql db table) as follows:

One column stores a string value, the length of this string value is highly variable, typically from several bytes to 500 megabytes(occasionally beyond 1 gigabytes )
Based on above, we decided to use CLOB type in db.(using system file is not an option somehow)
The table is very large up to several millions of records.
One of most frequent and important operation against this table is searching records by this CLOB column and the search string needs to EXACTlY match this CLOB column value.

My question is besides adding an index on CLOB column, whether we need to do some particular optimisation to improve the search performance?
One of my team member suggested adding an extra column in which to calculate SHA-256 hash of CLOB column above and search by this hash value instead of CLOB column. In terms of his opinion, the grounds of doing so are hash values are equal length other than variable so that indexing on that makes search faster.
However, I don't think this way makes big difference because assuming adding an explicit hash improves search performance database should be intelligent enough to do it by its own, likely storing this hash value in some hidden places of db system. Why bother we developers do it explicitly, on the other hand, this hash value theoretically creates collision although it's rare.
The only benefit I can imagine is when the client side of database does a search of which the keyword is very large, you can reduce network roundtrip by hashing this large value to a small length value, therefore network transferring is faster.
So any database gurus, please shed lights on this question. Many thanks!       
","Regular indexes don't work on CLOB columns.  Instead you would need to create an Oracle Text index, which is primarily for full text searching of key words/phrases, rather than full text matching.
In contrast by computing a hash function on the column data, you can then create an index on the hash value since it's short enough to fit in a standard VARCHAR2 or RAW column.  Such a hash function can significantly reduce your search space when trying to find exact matches.
Further your concern over hash collisions, while not unfounded can be mitigated.  First off, hash collisions are relatively rare, but when they do occur, the documents are unlikely to be very similar, so a direct text comparison could be used in situations where a collision is detected.  Alternatively due to the way hashing functions work, where small changes to the original document result in significant changes in the hash value, and where the same change to different documents affects the hash value differently, you could compute a secondary hash of a subset (or super set) of the original text to act as a collision avoidance mechanism.

","IANAC.
I don't really understand what you mean by ""Will I have a collision"" - 64 bits can of course never represent 256 bits so yes, very very many of your possible sha256 hashes can collapse to the same 64 bit CRC.
If you just want a shorter value for your hash, I'd suggest folding instead, for example by xor:ing every consecutive byte in your hash with each other.
Or by xor:ing the first half of your 256 bit string with the second half to yield a 128 bit value, and then xor:ing that result's first half with the result's second half again to yield a 64 bit value.
This 64 bit value will of course never be able to represent all the possible values of the 256 bit hash either but it will not be possible to start with this value and calculate a collision for your original 256 bit hash.

"45725461","How to ignore signature hash algorithm requested by server during TLS1.2 handshake?","I have a C# application making a successful TCP TLS 1.0 connection with mutual authentication to another company's server. It is implemented using SslStream class. We are just one of many clients of this very large organisation. 
This TCP link above must undergo TLS 1.2 + SHA2 upgrade. After doing all necessary steps on our side and successful testing with our local servers we are still failing all attempts to connect to the remote server. A lengthy investigation revealed that during TLS Handshake the server is sending to us a certificate request with only option for Signature Hash Algorithm = SHA1-RSA (see picture below). Our cerificate is SHA256. As a result, SslStream is not sending our certificate to the server at all and the server sees this as a Handshake Failure and closes down the connection.

The reason for this nuisance is that our counterparty uses very old (10.x) version of F5 firewall to terminate SSL. It only sends SHA1/RSA Signature Hash Algorithm in the certificate request although it supports the client’s SHA2 certificates.
While admitting the facts above, our counterparty is unable to upgrade F5 soon enough. They suggested to ignore the requested Signature Hash Algorithm and send our SHA256 certificate anyway. Apparently other clients connecting to them were able to do that somehow. 
Unfortunately,.Net's SslStream does not provide that level of fine tuning for TLS handshake. 
Hence the question: is it possible to ignore the server's request for SHA1RSA-based certificate at all? What options do I have? Are there SslStream alternatives that implement TLS 1.2? Is there an open-source third-party solution? Any suggestion would be helpful. Thanks in advance.
","The issue above was eventually resolved without any special code changes: a proxy server added on our side. It took care of communication with the other party. The proxy server is able to ignore the specific SHA1/RSA Signature Hash Algorithm in the incoming certificate request.

","Using openssl sha256 -sign ... makes openssl compute the PKCS#1 ""SHA256withRSA"" algorithm, fully specified by RFC-8017.
This does not simply means doing a SHA-256 digest and sign it with RSA, as you did in the second part of your example.
Here is why:
According to this RFC, the signature must have the same length than the RSA modulus. Your RSA modulus is 512 bits long (default value using openssl genrsa) or more, so the computed signature MUST have a length of 512 bits (or more). Even if the hash function (HMAC-SHA256) returns values of 256 bits length.
So, to compute a signature with 512 bits, from a 256 bits only HMAC-SHA256 digest, RFC-8017 requires you to use the I2OSP Integer-to-Octet-String primitive, that takes 2 arguments: your 256 bits hash, and the integer 512 (the length of your RSA modulus). I2OSP will output a 512 bits length octet string. finally, this is this octets string that will be encrypted with your RSA private key.
But you have not computed this intermediate Integer-to-Octet-String value.This is why your signatures do not match.

The excellent answer I got was that the type of social security numbers only has 366,000,000 hashes, which would make it easy to run a preimage attack. 
My question now is whether it is possible to avoid a preimage attack altogether. My scenario is that several clients need to store the social security number on a central server. The hashing must be consistent between the clients. The clients could communicate with online web services.
","Your problem is similar to what must be done when using passwords. Passwords fit in human brains, and, as such, cannot be much difficult to guess.
There are two complementary ways to mitigate risks when using low-entropy secrets:

Use iterated/repeated hashing to make each ""guess"" more expensive for the attacker.
Use salts to prevent cost sharing. The attacker shall pay the full dictionary search attack for every single attacked password/SSN.

One way to make hashing more expensive is to hash the concatenation of n copies of the data, with a n as big as possible (depending on the computing power of the clients, and, ultimately, the patience of the user). For instance, for (dummy) SSN ""123456789"", use H(123456789123456789123456789...123456789). You would count n in millions here; on a basic PC, SHA-256 can easily process a hundred megabytes per second.
A salt is a piece of public data which is used along the data to hash (the SSN), and which is different for each user. A salt needs not be secret, but it should not be reused (or at least not often). Since SSN tend to be permanent (an individual has a unique SSN for his whole life), then you can use the user name as salt (this contrasts with passwords, where a user can change his password, and should use a new salt for every new password). Hence, if user Bob Smith has SSN 123456789, you would end up using: H(""Bob Smith 123456789 Bob Smith 123456789 Bob Smith 123456789... Smith 123456789"") with enough repetitions to make the process sufficiently slow.
Assuming you can make the user wait for one second (it is difficult to make a user wait for more) on a not-so-new computer, it can be expected that even a determined attacker will have trouble trying more than a few hundred SSN per second. The cost of cracking a single SSN will be counted in weeks, and, thanks to the use of the user name as a salt, the attacker will have no shortcut (e.g. salting defeats precomputed tables, including the much-hyped ""rainbow tables"").

","I'll suggest to add npm package lazada-open-platform-sdk url https://www.npmjs.com/package/lazada-open-platform-sdk.
You can easily call lazada api's by its functions and mostly all are integrated by them.For finanace and seller apis which are not integrated by package for that you can use access_token generated by generateAccessToken and call apis.

"53696137","HMAC SHA256 Produces Different Result if String vs Variable in Liquid, Shopify","I'm doing some URL verification between a Shopify site and my app. On Shopify, in a .liquid file, I'm creating an HMAC value using Shopify's built in hmac_sha256 string filter. I'm using a secret key and a Twitch user ID which I've stored in a customer tag.
The hash value is passed as a query parameter to my app, which uses the crypto module in node.js to generate a hash and compare it with the hash from the url.
Things get strange here: In the .liquid file, when I type the Twitch ID directly into the string filter, the hash value generated by the .liquid file is the same value my app generates, and everything looks good:
{{ ""12345678""  | hmac_sha256: ""secret_key"" }}
However, when I pass the same Twitch ID as a variable into the string filter, the hash value the liquid file generates is different than the first time:
{{ twitchId  | hmac_sha256: ""secret_key"" }}
I've already tried removing whitespace and newline characters from the Twitch ID variable just in case there were any. I don't even have a guess as to what the problem could be. Maybe the variable (which is a string) is encoded differently than when I type it in directly?
For reference, the javascript code checking for matching hashes:
    // Get query string params:
    const { hash, twitchId } = req.query;
    console.log('Twitch ID in query: ' + twitchId);

    // Verify user

    if (generatedUserHash == hash) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }

","You need to show how you are assigning the ID to the variable. Without seeing that, there is no way to validate your question.
I did a quick test, and proved I get the same HMAC with a string and a variable, so it must be that you are doing something weird in your assignment:

","Turns out my variable twitchId was getting instantiated after I was trying to use it in the sha256 filter. I was instantiating it in my theme.liquid file, and I was trying to access it in a liquid file in my app (the request from the Shopify site is responded to with a liquid file).
I guess I wrongly assumed the theme.liquid file is loaded before the file in my response to Shopify. I assumed this because javascript variables I instantiate in my theme.liquid file are available in my response liquid file (I think this has something to do with liquid variables being created server-side and javascript variables being created client-side).
I am now instantiating the twitchId variable in my response liquid file. So that solved it.

"44028412","Java integer/double to unsigned byte","Now I understand java doesn't have unsigned bytes, but I'm not sure how to solve this if not.
I'm trying to implement SHA256 hashing in java, and i'm in the processing of converting the message to 512-bit.
int l = bytes.length; //total amount of bytes in the original message
int k = 0;
while((l+1+k) % 512 != 448) {
        k++;
}
//k is the total amount of 0's to be padded
int rest = k % 8;  //get the amount of 0's to be added in the byte with the 1
byte tmp =(byte) Math.pow(2, rest);

So the key instruction is the last row, if rest = 7 the resulting int is 128, but the bytes are signed in java and so the byte becomes 0x80 instead of 0xF0.
How can I achieve this in Java?
If anyone has a idea on how to implement this part please let me know.
","Starting from the assumption your message consists of bytes, the padding always works out as mupltiple of 8 bits, aka bytes. This ensures the most significant pad bit is always located in bit 7 of the first padding byte following the message, thus the padding, if any, is always started by 0x80, follwed by as many 0x00 as needed.
This can be implemented in a very simple manner:
public static byte[] padMsg(byte[] rawMsg) {
    int rawLen = rawMsg.length;
    int padLen = (64 - (rawLen & 0x3F)) & 0x3F;
    if (padLen == 0)
        return rawMsg;
    // all extra bytes in padded msg are zeros.
    byte[] paddedMsg = Arrays.copyOf(rawMsg, rawLen + padLen);
    // ensure topmost pad bit is a one
    paddedMsg[rawLen] = (byte) 0x80;
    return paddedMsg;
}

This takes the message length and gets the remainder. The remainder of a power of two (in this case 64), is most effectively gotten by simply and-masking with (power - 1), and this is where the 0x3F in the code comes from (= 64 - 1).
The remainder is taken again after calculating (64 - remainder) as prelimary padding length, to catch the special case where remainder is 0, leading to a wrong padding length of 64 bytes (which should be 0 padding).
Once the padding length in bytes is known, the case padding = 0 is caught. In any other case the message length is increased (with 0x00 bytes, Arrays.copyOf does this automatically). Then the first padding byte is replaced with 0x80 and the padded message that is now guaranteed to be a multiple of 64 bytes long is returned.

With the Scratchpad I generated a request. Scratchpad shows the string to sign and also the SHA 256 HMAC and the Base64 HMAC.
The string to sign consists of 4 lines like it's described in the docu.
There are several Onlineconverter for HMAC. I tried:
https://www.freeformatter.com/hmac-generator.html
https://codebeautify.org/hmac-generator
When I convert the string to sign which Scratchpad generated (the 4 lines), I get an other SHA 256 HMAC then Scratchpad generated.
Also there are several Onlineconverter for Base64. I tried:

https://www.base64encode.org
When I convert the SHA 256 HMAC which Scratchpad generated, I get an other Base64-String then Scrathpad generated.
This confuses me. What I don't understand?
Other point:
Later I think I want to use GET and not POST. Do I get this right, that the string to sign for GET also has to be in 4 lines and not in one line as it would be executed later? That's how I understand the docu.
I used these links:
http://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_US/dev_guide/DG_QueryString.html

","To answer my own questions.

Generate SHA256 with an Onlineconverter:
I suppose the Problem is the LF. The Onlineconverter maybe have problem with it. Maybe they use CRLF. Better don't try to check your SHA256 with Onlineconverters.

Generate base64 with an Onlineconverter:
The SHA256 Scratchpad shows is not the value you convert with base64. You have to convert the Hex-Value of the SHA256.

Query to sign with GET:
If you want to use GET, the query to sign has to look like the query to sign for POST. Also the four lines. Only swap POST with GET.

"39013731","Wrong bytes are sometimes written to disk. Hardware problems?","I have written a UDP based transfer protocol using C++ 11 (VS2013). It's blazing fast - and works great 99,9% of the time.

But I have observed a few times that the wrong bytes are written to disk (Samsung 250 GB SSD 850 EVO) - or atleast it seems so.
Here's basically what sometime happens when I transfer a 6GB test file:

The file is split up into smaller UDP datapackages - 64K in size. (Network layer disassebles and reassembles the UDP datagrams to a larger package).
Client sends the datapackage (udp) to the server - the payload is encrypted using AES256 (OpenSSL) and contains data + metadata. The Payload also contains a SHA256 Hash of the entire payload - as an extra integrity check on top up the UDP checksum. 
Server receives the datapackage, sends an ""ACK"" package back to the Client and then calculates the SHA256 Hash. The hash is identical to the Clients hash - all is good
Server then writes the data of the package to disk (Using fwrite instead of streams due to the huge performance differences). The server only processes one package at a time - and each filepointer has a mutex guard which protects it from being closed by another worker thread that closes filepointers that have been inactive for 10 secs.
Client receives UDP ""ACK"" packages and re-sends packages that have not been acked (meaning they didn't make it). The rate of incoming ACK packages controls the sending speed of the client (aka. congestion control/throtteling). The order of packages received on the server does not matter since each package contains a Position value (where in the file the data should be written).

After the entire file is transferred I do a full SHA256 hash of the 6GB file on both the server and the client, but to my terror I have observed twice the last few days that the hash is NOT the same (when making approx 20 test transfers).
After comparing the files in Beyond Compare, I usually find that there is one or two bits (in a 6 GB file) that is wrong on the serverside.
See screenshot below:
Server code - invoked after DataPackage hash has been verified
void WriteToFile(long long position, unsigned char * data, int lengthOfData){

    boost::lock_guard<std::mutex> guard(filePointerMutex);

    //Open if required
    if (filePointer == nullptr){
        _wfopen_s(&filePointer, (U(""\\\\?\\"") + AbsoluteFilePathAndName).c_str(), L""wb"");
    }

    //Seek
    fsetpos(filePointer, &position);

    //Write - not checking the result of the fwrite operation - should I?
    fwrite(data, sizeof(unsigned char), lengthOfData, filePointer);

    //Flush
    fflush(filePointer);

    //A separate worker thread is closing all stale filehandles 
    //(and setting filePointer to NULLPTR). This isn't invoked until 10 secs
    //after the file has been transferred anyways - so shouldn't matter
}

So to sum up:

The char * was correct in memory on the server - otherwise the Servers SHA256 Hash would have failed - right? (a hash collision with sha256 is extremely unlikely).
Corruption seems to happen when writing to disk. Since there are about 95.000 of these 64k packages written to disk when sending a 6GB file - and it only happens once or twice (when it happens at all) - means that it is a rare phenomenon

How can this happen? Is my hardware (bad ram/disk) to blame for this?
Do I actually need to read from disk after writing, and doing e.g. memcmp in order to be 100% sure that the correct bytes are written to disk?
(Oh boy - what a performance hit that will be...)
","On my local pc - it turned out that it was a RAM issue. Found out by running memtest86.
Nevertheless - I modified the code for our software that runs on our production servers - making it read from disk to verify that the correct bytes were in fact written. These servers write about 10TB to disk every day - and after a week of running the new code - the error happened once. The software corrects this by writing and verifying again - but it's still interesting to see that it actually happened. 
1 bit out of 560000000000000 bits were written wrong to disk. Amazing.
I will probably run memtest86 on this server later to see if this is also a RAM issue - but I'm not really super concerned about this anymore since file integrity is more or less ensured, and the servers are showing no signs of hardware problems otherwise.
So - if file integrity is extremely important to you (like it is for us) - then don't trust your hardware 100% and validate reading/writing operations. Anomalies might be an early sign of HW problems.

JAVASCRIPT PART
In my javascript code, I use Crypto Js to get SHA256:  
<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""plugin/CryptoJS v3.1.2/rollups/sha256.js""></script>  


Hash: function(){

    var o = ""13988354648xTpd9gMxF22nBcotVChIH5ocxplLQzI3Ba7xXBkMyyOVVr6e5/mupqxFHYVQD0U77BEbQ9auMWglUK63PeqCX4eB8kzBoOEAr1nXqpT3jjNwdYPQPdRvwPjdI/357CP"",
            hash256 = CryptoJS.SHA256(o),           
        ;

    console.log(hash256.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64)); 

}  

And the result is:  
a2fb2f75660e5085d4f8b01f218b4e7fb37ad2fe906a9eaa0604b7215c011ba9  

Obviously, they are not the same.  
Luckily, there was a version of JAVA code, that can produce same result. I just got this code from outsource developer, and I'm telling you, I'm not so familiar with JAVA.  
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

    MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");
    md.reset();
    byte[] buffer = hash.getBytes(""UTF-8"");
    md.update(buffer);
    byte[] digest = md.digest();

    for (int i  = 0; i < digest.length; i++){
      sb.append(Integer.toString((digest[i] & 0xff) + 0x100, 16).substring(1));
    }

    hashKey = Base64.encodeToString(digest, Base64.DEFAULT);

}

They said that they were able to get the correct result using this code. And if this code is possible to convert into javascript code, this may solved the problem.  
BTW, this code is part of a simple mobile app (html base) that will be published using PhoneGap. There is no API on the server that I can use to produce hash.
","The hashing part is actually working fine - you're getting the same binary data in both cases - the only difference is that your output in the Javascript is in hex, rather than base64. This C# code:
using System;

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string base64 = ""ovsvdWYOUIXU+LAfIYtOf7N60v6Qap6qBgS3IVwBG6k="";
        byte[] rawData = Convert.FromBase64(base64);
        Console.WriteLine(BitConverter.ToString(rawData));
    }
}

... prints out:
A2-FB-2F-75-66-0E-50-85-D4-F8-B0-1F-21-8B-4E-7F-B3-7A-D2-FE-90-6A-9E-AA-06-04-B7-21-5C-01-1B-A9

That's the same as your Javascript output, modulo casing and the ""-"" between bytes.
Having just tried this myself with Crypto-js, I think the problem is that you don't have the enc-base64.js component, which isn't included in the rollup. Just add:
<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""plugin/CryptoJS v3.1.2/components/enc-base64.js""></script>

... and everything should be okay. (Check that you've got that file, of course...)

"54177511","How do you connect to MySQL using PHP's mysqli when using sha256_password (access denied)","I'm using MySQL 5.7.24 and PHP 7.2.10. MySQL is configured with SSL. I have a user my_user with password abc123. I have tried configuring with both authentication plugins:
ALTER USER 'my_user'@'192.168.192.150' IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_password BY 'abc123';
ALTER USER 'my_user'@'192.168.192.150' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'abc123';

From my PHP server, I can successfully connect using the mysql command line client without specifying anything other than the host, user, and password. However, from PHP, I can connect only when using mysql_native_password. Not when using sha256_password.
The following PHP code works fine with mysql_native_password:
$mysqli = mysqli_init();
$mysqli->options(MYSQLI_OPT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT, 5);

$con = $mysqli->real_connect('192.168.192.100', 'my_user', 'abc123', 'my_db', 
3306, null, MYSQLI_CLIENT_SSL | MYSQLI_CLIENT_SSL_DONT_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT);
var_dump($mysqli->query('SELECT 1;'));

However, when I use sha256_password, I get the error ""Access denied for user 'my_user'@'192.168.192.150' (using password: YES)."" I've tried alternately adding both of the following statements (before real_connect) with no success (but, I would add, I shouldn't need either of these, since I can connect with the command line client without specifying these options*).
$mysqli->ssl_set(null, null, 'ca.pem', null, null);
$mysqli->ssl_set('client-key.pem', 'client-cert.pem', 'ca.pem', null, null);

So how is one supposed to use sha256_password from mysqli in PHP?
*NOTE: My PHP server is a different machine than my MySQL server. There is no my.cnf on the PHP that server that contains the ssl-ca, ssl-cert, and ssl-key options, so I really, try can connect without them using mysql.

","what I posted in first works very fine.. 
if I change vpc_amount to any (hardcoded) values that works.. 
the problem was when I assign the $totalAmount to vpc_amount the variable ($totalAmount) holds decimal points and thousand separators.. 
that makes this issue.. 
I just wanted to sanitize the variable before passing this totalAmount to the datato make it works..
so I've updated it as:
$real_integer_amount = filter_var($totalAmount, FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT);

and now this works fine..

@MagnusEriksson : thanks for the time and suggestions.. URL encoding did nothing with this issue.
@pvg there was no any spelling mistakes.. if I just use {$totalAmount} in the $data it did not work.. but this needed this : FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT
@miken32 thank you for your answer. I've tried to use your code just by replacing the params with my actual detail.. but it gave me this error ""HTTP Status - 400 E5000: Cannot form a matching secure hash based on the merchant's request using either of the two merchant's secrets""

What would be the easiest way to either convert the old vBulletin salt, or to check to see if the password is correct, and then generate a new salt for the first time they login?

In short, what is the easiest way to either convert or create a new salt?
","Do you know about the PHP function password_hash(), it is the recommended way to hash passwords. It automatically generates a cryptographically safe salt for each password and includes it in the resulting 60-character string.
$2y$10$nOUIs5kJ7naTuTFkBy1veuK0kSxUFXfuaOKdOKf9xYT0KKIGSJwFa

The example above is a possible result of password_hash(), have a look at the part $nOUIs5kJ7naTuTFkBy1veu, this is the generated salt and it will be used by the function password_verify() to check the password.
You won't have to worry about the salt anymore, no additional database field is necessary, just store the hash and you are fine!
The easiest way to migrate your passwords, is to wait for the user to login the next time. When he enters the password, you can check if the hash is already migrated, then check with password_verify(). If it is not yet migrated then check it with your old vBulletin code, if the password is correct then use password_hash() to generate a new hash and store it.

","You did not ask any question so there is nothing to answer here but either way I'll try to shed some light into your darkness :)
Your provider most likely adds some attribute certificate into the TS responses - I'd guess he's using DSE200 with TAC enabled just likely everyone else seeing similar issues - and OpenSSL currently does not support such scenarios. You can take a look at this older thread from openssl-users mailinglist where this issue had been discussed in details.

","Sorry I can't comment but something tells me that there is a length restriction on the salt column in your database.
Example: The salt field might only allow a 64 characters while the generated salt might be longer therefore when you save the salt it gets trimmed which ultimately changes the hashed password.
If that's the case, you might want to trim the salt before saving it.
I'd advise using PDO to make queries against your database.

","Your inputs to the hash function must be different for some reason or other.
Add log output messages that print your inputs before you hash for both use cases (create user and login).  Also be sure to put quotes around the inputs in your logging to show whitespace issues.
Compare the raw inputs as well as the output of the hash function in both cases, and there will be a difference somewhere.  If there is no difference, and the output of the hash is the same, then there is a problem in your query that is looking up the user in the login case.

","Short answer. No.
Hashes are completely different for minimal deviations and untill you can't calculate them back this won't work. Even if you can calculate them back, the result will be a list of possibilities you can choose from. So there is nothing deterministic.

","Hashing through data0 puts the system in some intermediate state. Your hash(data1) was calculated from a clean state. You cannot fix hash1 to make up for that missing intermediate state (for a good hash function).

","Seems like you have misunderstood SHA256. SHA256 is a hashing methodology and not a encryption methodology. 

A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of
  arbitrary size to data of a fixed size. The values returned by a hash
  function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes

wiki
Hash functions generates a unique value to each string/data passed to it as parameters and there is no way to get the string/data back from hash values. Hash functions are like one way stream
The only way you can use hash functions is to generate a unique value for each string you have. 
Here is one of the use case for SHA256 to help you better understand
For example, if your app has username and password for each user, saving password in DB as plain text is not much appreciated. Rather what we do is generate a hash key and save hash key in DB as password.
whenever user tries to login in future u get the password passed as param to your API generate the SHA for that and compare it with what you have saved in your DB. Because SHA256 generates a unique value for each string/Data passed to it no two passwords can have same hash value. That confirms that user is trying to login with proper credentials.
Hope this gives you idea of how to use SHA256

With the Key Value:

","I am not any C# expert, but there are a few things to be  checked:
Reading the documentation about Rfc2898DeriveBytes I see the function is using SHA1 hash, so try you may try to use PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 
On both instances (Rfc2898DeriveBytes, PBEKeySpec) you should make sure you the key size is the same (256 bit), it is surely wrong in your Java code
You may try to encode and print the keys to really make sure they are the same. 

I need to add Java Cryptography Extensions to allow 256 keys.

Depends on your JVM version. I believe Oracle JDK since v. 1.8u162 by default contains the Unlimited Strength JCE policy. If you take any current JRE version, you should be ok
Additional: you are using (static) zero array IV, which is not secure

","HMAC computes a hash from a secret and the data you want to authenticate. In order for two servers to compute the same HMAC they'll have to share the secret, which possibly makes it not that secret. In order too be able to verify old password the secret will need either to be fixed or to be somehow referenced along the stored password if it can changes, making it practically a salt.
Using HMAC in a password storage setting is pretty odd, it's not a proper password derivation function (way too fast, not memory intensive enough) and the secret don't bring much value if any, seeing it must be fixed (unlike proper HMAC usage where the secret is agreed upon by the communicating parties for a session and forgotten about after).

"22643764","PHP Hashing Login Issue","I'm a bit of a n00b in regards to hashing passwords, so go easy on me. Basically, I've put together some code that first of all sanitises the string's entered by the user on registration. Once that's done, a random salt is generated. The password is then appended to the salt:
  $salt = bin2hex(mcrypt_create_iv(32, MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM));

    $saltedPW =  $p . $salt;

I then hash the password using a sha256 and go ahead and insert the user into the database, which all appears to be working correctly:
   $hashedPW = hash('sha256', $saltedPW);

    $q = ""INSERT INTO user (id, name, email, password, verified, user_level, salt) VALUES
    (NULL, '$n', '$em', '$hashedPW', 'no', '1', '$salt')"";

    $r = @mysqli_query ($dbc, $q); //run the query

Then, when it comes to the user logging in, I again sanitise the user-entered string, get the salt from the database assign it to a variable before appending the password to it as follows:
       $saltQuery = ""SELECT salt FROM user WHERE email = '$email'"";

        $result = mysqli_query($dbc, $saltQuery);

        $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);

        $salt = $row['salt'];

        $saltedPW =  $password . $salt;

The salted password is then hashed using a sha256, as before, and I attempt to get the user information from the database:
    $hashedPW = hash('sha256', $saltedPW);

      $query = ""SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = '$email' AND password = '$hashedPW'"";

        $r = @mysqli_query ($dbc, $query);

However, the login fails, and when I print off the query I get the following result, when I presume the password should equal the user's entered string, which in this case is 'password' for testing purposes:
  SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = 'test@test.com' AND password = '5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8'

Is there anything you can see there that I'm doing wrong that would cause the login to fail? Thanks
","SHA256 is a message digest, not a password hashing function, so you certainly should not be using it as such.
Cryptography is hard, and to do it well is even harder - it is for this reason that you should avoid rolling your own encryption functions and use ones that are tried and true, such as bcrypt or the newer scrypt.
PHP provides access to the bcrypt alogirthm through the password_hash function, which automatically generates a salt and encrypts the password using a much greater degree of security than SHA256. You would use it like so:
$hashedPassword = password_hash($password);

Then, when the user logs in, you would hash the password he inputted using the same function, and retrieve that user from the database.

(Implementation available here, along with an explanation for how this works by Mark Adler here).
This allows us, for example, to compute a hash on a single stream in parallel, or to compute a hash on a large (as in 'doesn't fit in memory'), severely fragmented stream using only forward seeking on its containing medium (this offers enormous potential for speedup on very slow media).
There don't appear to be implementations for such behavior available for other, more complex, hashing algorithms like MD5. Is this behavior fundamentally impossible with MD5? Is it just so difficult to do that no one bothered trying yet? What about more complex algorithms like SHA1 or SHA256? I would love to hear any insights on this.

It is easy to show that if you keep doing this, you end up with a single loop of 2^32 bit sequences, before starting over.
Simple question: does anyone know if the same holds true (or not) for SHA256, starting with a 256-bit sequence? Would a similar process cycle through a loop of all 2^256 possible 256-bit sequences before starting over? Or are there known (or likely) shorter loops within this hash?
Brian
","SHA256 has not been designed to meet the property of 2^256 loop. However, as far as I know, nobody has proven there is no such loop. Also, there are not known any shorter loops because if anybody found some, then he would find also a collision and from the nature of the cryptographic hash function, it muse be difficult.
So, since nobody has not proven it, yes, there is a probability the 2^256 cycle would exists. However, it's extremely unlikely an I'm willing to bet my left testicle for it. :-)
Let me also note that, IMO to design a cryptographic hash function which has 2^256 loop would be extremely difficult even for the best crypto experts.

The padding consists of a single '1', followed by as many 0's as needed to made the size of the block congruent to 448 mod(512), and then the size of the message (excluding the 1 and the padding) as a 64 bit unsigned integer. 
I'm unclear as to the reason for the '1'. A reason that pops-up in unofficial sources is that it serves to prevent birthday attacks but the lenght at the end seems suffiscient to that purpose. 
Elsewhere it is said that the 1 is needed to make the padding Merkle–Damgård-compliant (MD-compliant) but unless something really eluded me the size feild at the end is clearly suffiscient. 
see: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%E2%80%93Damg%C3%A5rd_construction#MD-compliant_padding
Finally a source wrote that this was necessary to process an empty string (why?) and another to make the padding reversible (what for?).
I'm always suspicious when I find so many different explainations. Can anyone explain me this with an example.

This will lose any leading 0s - in other words, any byte less than 16 will come out as a single hex digit instead of two.

Manually append 0 if the value is between 0 and 15 (ick)

"43234050","Testing equality of SHA-256 digests using bitwise operators","I'm implementing a token system in a nodeJS app where I need to check the equality of two strings that have been hashed using SHA256. My initial idea was that I can simply test equality using a strict equal operator (hash1 === hash2) because digests should produce the same string if they had the same input. However, I've seen an article from Paragon Initiative claiming it's safer to compare the strings using bitwise operators on each character's ascii code. 
To compare the digest tokens, the Paragon code uses the following code snippet (PHP):
public static function hash_equals($hash1, $hash2)
    ...

    $res = 0;
    $len = \strlen($hash1);
    for ($i = 0; $i < $len; ++$i) {
        $res |= \ord($hash1[$i]) ^ \ord($hash2[$i]);
    }
    return $res === 0;
}

Basically, the characters at each index using a bitwise XOR and then saved to a flag value using a bitwise OR. If any of the characters mismatch, then the difference is saved in $res.
Is this any more effective than using a strict string comparison? Hash digests are just strings and I don't know why a simple string comparison would be less effective than explicitly checking every sing byte in the strings.

I looked into it and the scmp tool on npm can be used for constant-time string comparisons in Javascript.
As of 4/5/2017, it had no vulnerabilities according to the nsp and snyk tools.
","Edit: Use built in hash_equals in PHP for timing attack resistant compares.
See hash_equals PHP doc. Explanation left below.
The reason you shouldn't use string comparisons for testing hashes and such is that they are optimized to return as soon as they can tell the strings aren't equal.
In normal code, this is a good thing.  You want the result as quickly as possible.  When it comes to security though, that leaks information.
If an attacker repeatedly submits different strings and is able to measure a difference in the amount of time until he is denied access, he can use that as a way to determine how much of the substring he has correctly guessed.
Please see this post on security.stackexchange.com and this blog post on timing attacks for more information.

"43234050","Testing equality of SHA-256 digests using bitwise operators","I'm implementing a token system in a nodeJS app where I need to check the equality of two strings that have been hashed using SHA256. My initial idea was that I can simply test equality using a strict equal operator (hash1 === hash2) because digests should produce the same string if they had the same input. However, I've seen an article from Paragon Initiative claiming it's safer to compare the strings using bitwise operators on each character's ascii code. 
To compare the digest tokens, the Paragon code uses the following code snippet (PHP):
public static function hash_equals($hash1, $hash2)
    ...

    $res = 0;
    $len = \strlen($hash1);
    for ($i = 0; $i < $len; ++$i) {
        $res |= \ord($hash1[$i]) ^ \ord($hash2[$i]);
    }
    return $res === 0;
}

Basically, the characters at each index using a bitwise XOR and then saved to a flag value using a bitwise OR. If any of the characters mismatch, then the difference is saved in $res.
Is this any more effective than using a strict string comparison? Hash digests are just strings and I don't know why a simple string comparison would be less effective than explicitly checking every sing byte in the strings.

Update:
I looked into it and the scmp tool on npm can be used for constant-time string comparisons in Javascript.
As of 4/5/2017, it had no vulnerabilities according to the nsp and snyk tools.
","Comparing hashes the way you compare normal strings could make your program/app/website/whatever vulnerable to timing attacks.
Normal string comparison is fast, you'll get the result as soon as possible. But when it comes to security, that comparison will leak information. By measuring the difference in time it takes to check certain strings an attacker can determine how much of a substring he has guessed correctly. (Anthony Ferrara has posted a very nice article explaining this in detail)
To prevent that from happening we have to check the two hashes using the exact same time. In PHP (>5.6.0) you can use the timing attack safe string comparison function hash_equals().

The problem reads:

Update:
Using Eclipse and Java for this code. This is suggested to be used by the developer. 
Confirmed by developer that 0xcafebabe is what is supposed to be used. Within Eclipse though 0xCafeBabe will give the same result as 0xcafebabe.
This gives me -136549677759 as a result, which I then put into the .txt file and save. Unfortunately this is not correct as developer options are not becoming available.

This is the result for -136549677759 and it does not work. I believe that we are looking for the checksum of the final result.
","Disclosure: I'm the author of Scelight.
Notes beforehand: the problem statement does not require you to use Java, any programming language can be used.

Solution in Java

having the hexadecimal representation of the SHA-256 checksum of...

We need to calculate the SHA-256 checksum of something, and the checksum has to be presented using hexadecimal numbers. Case (lower or upper case letters) in the hexadecimal representation does not matter.

the max value of an 8-byte signed integer

This is Long.MAX_VALUE = (1L<<63)-1 = 9223372036854775807L.
long a = Long.MAX_VALUE;


shifted right by a value of 0x1a

a >>= 0x1a;


and XOR-ed with the hex value CafeBabe.

You need to use a value of type long being 0xcafebabe. But note that if you use the value 0xcafebabe, that is a constant of type int and if you convert it to long, the sign bit will be used to extended it:
System.out.printf(""%x"", (long)0xcafebabe); // Prints ffffffffcafebabe

So use a long constant:
a ^= 0xcafebabeL;

The result so far:
a = 134033261889


...having the hexadecimal representation of the SHA-256 checksum of the decimal representation of...

The SHA-256 checksum (exception handling omitted!):
byte[] result = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"").digest((""""+a).getBytes());

Notes about String.getBytes(): yes, it returns the bytes of the string using the platform's default charset. But since the string only contains digits (optionally a negative sign but in our case it is positive), it is ok. In a mission critical application encoding should be specified, something like this: (""""+a).getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8).
And the hexadecimal representation:
for (byte b : result) {
    System.out.printf(""%02x"",b);
}

Note the ""%02x"" format string, hex representation of a byte must be 2 hex digits, first being 0 if it is equal to or less than 0xf.
The first 8 characters of the output (trimmed, at least run the code if you want the full output):
e0dd2851...

The full runnable code:
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    long a = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    a >>= 0x1a;
    a ^= 0xcafebabeL;

    byte[] result = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"").digest(("""" + a).getBytes());
    for (byte b : result) {
        System.out.printf(""%02x"", b);
    }
}

The full runnable code in ""compact"" mode:
for (byte b : MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"")
        .digest(Long.toString((Long.MAX_VALUE >> 0x1a ^ 0xcafebabeL)).getBytes()))
    System.out.printf(""%02x"", b);

Solution in Go
Solution in Go is even shorter:
a := int64(math.MaxInt64)
a >>= 0x1a
a ^= 0xcafebabe
fmt.Printf(""%x"", sha256.Sum256([]byte(fmt.Sprint(a))))

And the ""compact"" one-liner:
fmt.Printf(""%x"", sha256.Sum256([]byte(fmt.Sprint(int64(1<<63-1)>>0x1a^0xcafebabe))))

The Go solutions can be tried on the Go Playground.

","The problem is the encoding.
JWT uses base64url encoding :

A JWT is represented as a sequence of URL-safe parts separated by
     period ('.') characters.  Each part contains a base64url-encoded
     value.

but you are using base64 encoding in the signature, as shown in your code example. 
The difference between base64url encoding and base64 encoding is, that the characters '+' and '/' from the normal base64 output will be replaced by '-' and '_' and the trailing '=' (padding) will be omitted.
You say:

And I found the ""-"",""_"" in webside and convert ""+"",""/"" in my output signature. 

With '-' and '_' instead of '+' and '/' you have a correct output.
When you have a base64url encoded signature like this

","SHA256 is a hash function and that's a oneway enryption. There is no way to decrypt it. The whole purpose of a cryptographic hash function is that you can't reverse it. It is used for example to verify a users password: Compare the hash of a users password with the hash saved in the database, to verify a users identity.
If you want to break it you can try these techniques:

Brute force
Rainbow tables

","You have this:
declare @cryptString varchar(50) 

And you try to use it to hold this value:
müller

That's bad. You need an nvarchar for anything that could go beyond basic ascii characters.
But that's just for starters. nvarchar uses UTF-16 (see the section headed ""Supplementary Characters"" about halfway down the page). The web site may be using UTF-32 or (likely) UTF-8 to encode those characters. Either one will use slightly different byte representations, which will produce completely different hash values. 
I believe you're seeing UTF-8 at https://hashgenerator.de/, because UTF-8 matches ASCII when only using ASCII characters. With UTF-8, simple values like test would then produce the same result for both the web site and the database.
To fix this, understand the SQL hash will use either ASCII or UTF-16, and so you must change your encoding on whatever other platform you're using to match the database. The simplest option is probably to always use UTF-16 for these values, but you could also choose to stick with varchar on the database and convert your text to ascii before calculating the hash elsewhere (with the understanding that you'll lose some fidelity).

The main thing in this problem is when my user set a very very weak password. No matter how hard my mixed-up hashing algorithm, and how long my salt is, I think it can be cracked in less than 1 year.
I've been thinking for a new way. I've made a script that will re-encrypt the password every time the user sign-out by adding a random salt on the old hashed password, then encrypt it again. So, every time the user come back, the encrypted password is different. Get it?
But the main problem on this idea is, I must store the new salt every time the user sign-out. Imagine my code will look like, if the user is sign-in and sign-out everyday?
Any idea?
Oh, I have an idea. How about regenerate new encrypted password every year?
","There are two problems with your main assumptions. The first one is about the problem of storing the salt. You already do for the salted password solution. With your new approach, salt would change over time, and that's it. So you could have used this method and the only extra cost would be the re-calculation of the hash value at every login (when you actually have the password string itself).
The second problem is the more important one: a re-hashing will not change anything. As soon as your attacker gets hold of one salted hash value, it will be enough to mount a dictionary attack. The fact that you change your salts and the hash in your database will not make it any more difficult. So there is no need to recalculate a hash after the first one is created.

Oh, I have an idea. How about regenerate new encrypted password every year?
","Re-encryption doesn't help with your problem.
The only thing you can do is create a multi part hash, and hope the attacker doesn't get all of them. I usually use a two part salt:
One part is a random per user value stored in the database alongside the password.
The other part is a per application salt. You can store it in the application config or in a special password store the OS offers.
The advantage of that split is that it's not enough if the attacker just gains access to the database, but he needs to get access to wherever your application salt is stored. So for example a simple sql injection stealing your database isn't enough. If the attacker can execute code it probably won't help at all.

And you should use some method to slow down hashing. Typical hash functions are fast, so brute-force is fast too. But if you iterate the hash-function a million times it still doesn't slow down a valid login much, but slows down brute-force a lot.
You can achieve that using a Password Based Key Derivation Function such as PBKDF2.

"5133466","How To Secure Encrypted Password Even The Weakest One?","I am always looking for ways to secure my user's passwords. I am currently using some combination of hashing algorithm with random salt.
The main thing in this problem is when my user set a very very weak password. No matter how hard my mixed-up hashing algorithm, and how long my salt is, I think it can be cracked in less than 1 year.
I've been thinking for a new way. I've made a script that will re-encrypt the password every time the user sign-out by adding a random salt on the old hashed password, then encrypt it again. So, every time the user come back, the encrypted password is different. Get it?
But the main problem on this idea is, I must store the new salt every time the user sign-out. Imagine my code will look like, if the user is sign-in and sign-out everyday?
Any idea?
Oh, I have an idea. How about regenerate new encrypted password every year?
","You could use ""key stretching"": iterate the hash, say, a million times, after salting.
Then store hash value, salt, and iteration count.
Then an attacker could check a million times fewer passwords per second than when you hash once. But a very short password will still fall: note that you yourself, to verify the legitimate password, need to do the same operation. Suppose you accept a 1 second time for yourself to check, then the attacker can also check passwords at 1 second per password, on a similar machine (and more if he used more or faster machines!). And 1 second per password can still be enough to check for weak and short password, standard dictionaries etc. There really is no defending against it, only making it harder.

Thanks for your input!
","This is not a definitive answer but this is my suspicion what happens:
docx and xlsx file formats are basically a bunch of zipped-up xml-files. This can easily be seen when renaming them to .zip and opening with your favorite zip-tool.
When examining a file created by word I noticed that the change-timestamp of all files contained in the archive is always 1980-01-01 00:00:00 while in those created with POI it will show the actual timestamp the file was created.
So my I suspect that your problem occurs when there is a timestamp-difference between one or more of the files in excelAdHoc1 and excelAdHoc2. This might happen when the clock switches to the next second while creating one or the other file.
This would not affect XLS-files since the HSSF-format is not of the ""zipped xml""-type and thus does not contain any nested files that might have different timestamps.
To change the timestamps after writing the file you could try using the `java.util.zip``-package. I haven't tested it but this should do the trick:
ZipFile file = new ZipFile(pathToFile);
Enumeration<ZipEntry> e = file.entries();
while(e.hasMoreElements()) {
    ZipEntry entry = e.nextElement();
    entry.setTime(0L);

Does anybody have a clue, what could be causing this, if not a bug in POI itself? Basically, the code above refers to

Thanks for your input!
","Ok, I've found a way to reset all XSLX file entry file time attributes, according to some example found here at SO. Unfortunately, only file entries seem to be accessible by methods like via ZipFile or OPCPackage. I could not find a solution to also access and reset the folders inside the archive, which also have differing time attributes. 
So far, I didn't succeed in eliminating the differing properties of the POI-generated XLSX-archives, to get same SHA256 hashes out of two otherwise identical files, for which the differing attributes seem to be the reason.
private void resetOPCPTimeAttributes(File file)
        throws InvalidFormatException, IOException, OpenXML4JException, XmlException {

    OPCPackage opcp = ZipPackage.open(file);
    resetZipfileContentTimeAttributes(opcp.getParts());

    opcp.flush();
    opcp.close();
}

private void resetZipfileContentTimeAttributes(List<PackagePart> parts) throws InvalidFormatException {

    ArrayList<PackagePart> subParts = null;
    for (PackagePart part: parts) {

        PackageProperties props = part.getPackage().getPackageProperties();
        props.setLastModifiedByProperty("""");
        props.setCreatedProperty("""");
        props.setModifiedProperty("""");

        subParts = part.getPackage().getParts();

        while (subParts != null) {
            resetZipfileContentTimeAttributes(subParts);
        }
    }
}

Edit:
In the meantime (until I or someone else finds a solution for manipulating folder meta data inside the Zip archive), I've switched to the deep comparing solution here: Comparing XLSX files

The formula is

Server Seed + Client Seed (->byte[4]) + Bet Number (->byte[4])
Double SHA2-512 hash the result
Keep taking groups of 3 bytes and converting to an integer, until a value less than 16 million is found. If you run out of bytes, hash it
  again and start over.
Find the value's modulus of 1 million
The modulus is the bet result!


Which have an example code in C#
static bool VerifyBetResult(string serverSeed, int clientSeed, int betNumber,
                            long betResult, string serverSeedHash = null)
{
    Func<string, byte[]> strtobytes = s => Enumerable
        .Range(0, s.Length / 2)
        .Select(x => byte.Parse(s.Substring(x * 2, 2), NumberStyles.HexNumber))
        .ToArray();
    byte[] server = strtobytes(serverSeed);
    byte[] client = BitConverter.GetBytes(clientSeed).Reverse().ToArray();
    byte[] num = BitConverter.GetBytes(betNumber).Reverse().ToArray();
    byte[] serverhash = serverSeedHash == null ? null : strtobytes(serverSeedHash);
    byte[] data = server.Concat(client).Concat(num).ToArray();

    {
        if (serverhash != null)
            using (SHA256 sha256 = new SHA256Managed())
                if (!sha256.ComputeHash(server).SequenceEqual(serverhash))
                    throw new Exception(""Server seed hash does not match server seed"");
        byte[] hash = sha512.ComputeHash(sha512.ComputeHash(data));
        while (true)
        {
            for (int x = 0; x <= 61; x += 3)
            {
                long result = (hash[x] << 16) | (hash[x + 1] << 8) | hash[x + 2];
                if (result < 16000000)
                    return result % 1000000 == betResult;
            }
            hash = sha512.ComputeHash(hash);
        }
    }
}

Using these values

I have the following declared in my security domain, but every time I try to login, it says the credentials are incorrect. When I don't use encryption, and remove the hashAlgorithm and hashEncoding properties, and store the passwords in the clear, authentication works fine. Can anyone see any problem with my encryption method?
<module-option name=""hashAlgorithm"" value=""SHA-256""/>

I tried to follow an example that had a straightforward encryption method:

The problem is that it says that the jar that contains the Util class was in the module directory of the JBoss installation, but it must have been an older example because I don't see it.
","Your issue is using the BigInteger to create the hexadecimal encoding; BigInteger can be created using big endian encoding in a byte array. However, if the byte array starts with one or more 00 valued bytes, then these bytes may be stripped. Use Guava, Apache Codec or Bouncy Castle to create a hexadecimal string instead.
That said, you should use a password based key derivation function (PBKDF) such as PBKDF2 (present in the standard Java API), bcrypt or scrypt to store password ""hashes"". These output bytes as well, so if you require text, you will still need to encode it.
Also note that String.getBytes() uses the platform encoding, which you should only use to communicate with the standard. Instead, you should supply a character encoding to String.getBytes() method, e.g. use  String.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8).

I'm doing this as I am of the understanding that anything signed with my PRIVATE key can be decrypted with my PUBLIC - such as this for verification?  Is this wrong?
I'm encrypting the hash with these methods:

but passing my PRIVATE KEY down instead of my PUBLIC KEY.
Then to verify the signature, I am using:

                var decrypted = Decrypt(Convert.FromBase64String(text), keySize, privateKey);

but passing down my PUBLIC KEY rather than the PRIVATE KEY. At this point, I am getting an error ""Key does not exist"".
I'm presuming this is the case because the PRIVATE KEY contains the relevant key information for the PUBLIC KEY so it can decode this one-way.
How can I sign a block of text in this way that allows me to distribute a signature with it, that can be decrypted by anybody who knows my PUBLIC KEY?

This is the higher level method that accepts the message
std::string Sign(const std::string& key, const

The actual RSA sign method appears pretty straightforward. From my understanding, this should first hash the content using SHA256 then proceeds to encrypting with RSA.
bool RSASign(RSA* rsa,
        const unsigned char* msg,
        size_t msgLength,
        unsigned char** outMsg,

if(EVP_DigestSignInit(context, NULL, EVP_sha256(), NULL, privateKey) <= 0)
{
    return false;   // Initialize the digest failed
}

if (EVP_DigestSignUpdate(context, msg, msgLength) <= 0) 
{
    return false;   // Adding the message failed
}

if (EVP_DigestSignFinal(context, NULL, outMsgLength) <= 0)
{
    return false;   // Finalization failed, cannot create signature
}

*outMsg = (unsigned char*)malloc(*outMsgLength);
if(EVP_DigestSignFinal(context, *outMsg, outMsgLength) <= 0)
{
    return false;   // Error creating encoded message
}
EVP_MD_CTX_destroy(context);
// End of context

return true;
}

For completeness, this is where the actual creation of the RSA object happens:
RSA* CreateRSAFromString(const std::string& key, bool isPrivate)
{
RSA* rsa = NULL;
BIO* keybio = BIO_new_mem_buf((void*)key.c_str(), -1);  

if(!keybio)
{
    return NULL;
}

rsa = isPrivate ? PEM_read_bio_RSAPrivateKey(keybio, NULL, NULL, NULL):
                  PEM_read_bio_RSA_PUBKEY(keybio, NULL,NULL, NULL);
return rsa;
}

I want to verify if my process is correct, because when outputting the hex result, I get totally different results between the commandline and C++. Specifically, the equivalent command I am trying to achieve is the following:
dgst -sha256 -sign certifcate.pem -out signed.txt inputFile.json

If I can ensure the OpenSSL side of things is correct, then I can probably deduce it is my conversion to hex that introduces the discrepancy. No errors or failures were outputted on the OpenSSL side of things.

Can someone explain how to get the Perl code to produce the same output as the Java?
","Two problems:

The Java version works with bytes, the Perl version with strings of digits. Use pack to convert the strings to their byte equivalents.
In the Java version, you are applying the hash to the hash computed so far, in the Perl code, you just hash the same value again and again.

","I just had this exact same problem and solved it.
The issue is that your are including a different header  in your code than the SHA2 library you linked into your application is using.
In my case the SHA256_CTX struct was a different size in the openSSL library.  The openSSL library's struct was 8 bytes bigger than the struct length in the  file.
The function SHA256_Init(&ctx) does a memset on the SHA256_CTX struct which then corrupts 8 extra random bytes after the struct.  I say random because it will do different things in a release vs debug build because the optimizing compiler will move your variables around.

I've been struggling with returning the correct HMAC. I'm using ring for the SHA256 digests but no matter what I try, I can't seem to get the right result. I suspect it might have something to do with .as_ref().to_vec() conversions. Even if that's true, I don't know how to continue from that. Not everything from RFC 2104 is implemented in the following code, but it highlights my issue.
extern crate ring;
use ring::{digest, test};

pub fn hmac(k: Vec<u8>, mut m: Vec<u8>) -> Vec<u8> {
    // Initialize ipad and opad as byte vectors with SHA256 blocksize

    // iround and oround are used to seperate the two steps with XORing
    let mut iround = vec![];
    let mut oround = vec![];

    for count in 0..k.len() {
        iround.push(k[count] ^ ipad[count]);
        oround.push(k[count] ^ opad[count]);
    }

    iround.append(&mut m); // m is emptied here
    iround = (digest::digest(&digest::SHA256, &iround).as_ref()).to_vec();
    oround.append(&mut iround); // iround is emptied here
    oround = (digest::digest(&digest::SHA256, &oround).as_ref()).to_vec();
    let hashed_mac = oround.to_vec();

    return hashed_mac;
}

#[test]
fn test_hmac_digest() {
    let k = vec![0x61; 64];

}

These are the digests:
Actual = [139, 141, 144, 52, 11, 3, 48, 112, 117, 7, 56, 151, 163, 65, 152, 195, 163, 164, 26, 250, 178, 100, 187, 230, 89, 61, 191, 164, 146, 228, 180, 62]

o_key_pad = key xor [0x5c * blockSize]   //Outer padded key
i_key_pad = key xor [0x36 * blockSize]   //Inner padded key

Here's what my take on the function would look like. I believe it has less allocation:
extern crate ring;

use ring::{digest, test};

const BLOCK_SIZE: usize = 64;

pub fn hmac(k: &[u8], m: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
    assert_eq!(k.len(), BLOCK_SIZE);

    let mut i_key_pad: Vec<_> = k.iter().map(|&k| k ^ 0x36).collect();
    let mut o_key_pad: Vec<_> = k.iter().map(|&k| k ^ 0x5C).collect();

    i_key_pad.extend_from_slice(m);

    let hash = |v| digest::digest(&digest::SHA256, v);

    let a = hash(&i_key_pad);

    o_key_pad.extend_from_slice(a.as_ref());

    hash(&o_key_pad).as_ref().to_vec()
}

"49858254","Make server use SHA256 even if Client does not send Signature Algorithm in the request","Am using a .net application where the client connects to our server using TCP SSL Stream. Application is using .net 4.5 and running as a windows service in Windows server 2012 R2.
We are using SHA256 certificate and Client is not able to negotiate with strict TLS 1.2. was getting ""client and server cannot communicate, because they do not possess a common algorithm - SSLStream""
stream.AuthenticateAsServer(serverCertificate, false, SslProtocols.Tls12, True);

Thanks to Steffen Ullrich for this answer which helped me troubleshoot further.
When we use SHA1 Certificate Client is able to successfully negotiate with TLS 1.2
from RFC

If the client does not send the signature_algorithms extension, the
  server MUST do the following:
If the negotiated key exchange algorithm is one of (RSA, DHE_RSA,
  DH_RSA, RSA_PSK, ECDH_RSA, ECDHE_RSA), behave as if client had sent
  the value {sha1,rsa}.

My client is supporting SHA256 but they are not sending signature algorithm as part of the TLS 1.2 request and server by default negotiates with SHA1 and not SHA256.
SHA256,SHA1 works fine with TLS 1.0
SHA1 works with strict TLS 1.2
SHA256 not working with strict TLS 1.2

So my question Is there a way i can make the server to negotiate using SHA256 also even if my client does not send signature algorithm?

"52295989","Fetching and hashing a file from a URL in a Zapier code action in JavaScript","I was looking for a way to hash files manipulated in a Zapier code action and since Zapier does not provide such crypto transforms by default, I went on to implement it in Javascript. 
The code below does this:

fetch the file from a public URL 
hash said file using sha256
return the hash in the output



const crypto = require('crypto');
    
return fetch(inputData.fileUrl)
  .then((res)=>{
    console.log(res.ok);
    console.log(res.status);
    console.log(res.statusText);
    return res.buffer()
  })
  .then((buffer)=>{
    const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256');
    hash.update(buffer);
    callback (null, {""hashValue"":hash.digest('hex')});
  })
  .catch(callback)



I am basically calling 'fetch' on the S3 URL, returning the result as a buffer() call on the response object. I then create a 'crypto' object from said buffer, from which I create a sha256 hash and hex digest.
Note: 
Javascript code actions in Zapier can only take strings as input parameters, so any files you want to hash need to transit through a storage space (e.g. AWS S3 bucket) that has a publicly accessible URL. If you manipulate private/sensitive data, you may want to delete the file in a subsequent action in your zap. Beware also of non ascii characters in the URL (e.g. fetching from AWS S3 returns a 403 Forbidden error if your URL includes such characters as '€')
I hope Zapier users will find this useful, e.g. to automate workflows where you need to ensure file data integrity (accounting, invoicing ...)

                  e.printStackTrace();
               }

Please suggest why there is a difference in both of the results. I have also tried the below implementation in java but it is not working for empty salt value:
public static String convertSHAWithSalt(String value, String salt)
            throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        String data = """";
        Mac sha256Hmac = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA256"");
            SecretKeySpec secretkey = new SecretKeySpec(salt.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8), ""HmacSHA256"");
            sha256Hmac.init(secretkey);
            data = bytesToHex(sha256Hmac.doFinal(data.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)));
            System.out.println(data);
    }

","There is a difference between SHA-256 and HMAC-SHA-256. 
HMAC-SHA-256 (see also HMAC) is an algorithm for generating a MAC using the SHA-256-hash-algorithm.
The result of the first Java-code and the C#-code are different, because the Java-code uses SHA-256 and the C#-code HMAC-SHA-256.
Since you want to use HMAC-SHA-256 I focus on that and I ignore the first Java-code.
The result of the C#-code for the text 
This is an arbitrary text!

with the key 
1234567890

is
25583e6e0b6c2c3a5c50ebd9ea48138a960a7ca2a215fae2b4b82ee99734deb4

The second Java-code uses HMAC-SHA-256 as well. If you replace the lines 
data = bytesToHex(sha256Hmac.doFinal(data.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)));
System.out.println(data);

with
data = bytesToHex(sha256Hmac.doFinal(value.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)));
return data;

then, the ouput is the same (provided that your (not posted) bytesToHex-method works in a proper way, see e.g. How to convert a byte array to a hex string in Java?).
Btw, in the second Java-code you should change the labeling salt to something like key since that's the common wording in the context of a MAC. A salt is typically used in combination with a password hashing like in your first Java-code.
Note: In the Java-code it's not allowed to use an empty byte-array as SecretKeySpec-input. This throws an IllegalArgumentException (Empty key). However, the HMACSHA256-ctor in the C#-code accepts an empty byte-array and internally pads it with 0-values. Thus, with regard to your testcase (text: abcd, empty key) you can simulate in the Java-code the empty byte-array by a byte-array containing a single 0-value. Then, the output of the Java-code equals the output of the C#-code. Sure, an empty key should only be used for this testcase.

    System.out.println(""Guava  : Sha256hash: ""+ hashed);
}

When I run the program I get the following values. Both hashes are exactly same.
Apache : Sha256hash: b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9
Guava  : Sha256hash: b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9

Now, I generated the Sha256 hash for the string ""hello world"" from command line.
command line util sha2
echo ""hello world"" | sha2 -256

As you see from these examples, the values generated from Command line differ from values generated from Java ( Apache and Guava )
The input string is same, but the hashes are different. Why this difference happens?
","I literally had a revision to this answer recently.
The issue is echo adds a newline to your data. If you used echo -n or openssl dgst -sha256 <<< 'hello world' you'd get the right value.

","Switching between GET and POST requires more than just changing the verb in the request. A GET request needs to have the data as part of the URL string so try:
url = url & ""?"" & getdata
getdata = """"
httpObject.Open ""GET"", ""https://testnet.bitmex.com"" & url, False

You also need to change this line from:
httpObject.Send (getdata)

to:
httpObject.Send

The way in which you construct the api-signature value is also different for GET requests to this API - see here for details. The changes I have suggested should lead to the correct signature being generated. If you need to URL encode data in VBA then this answer might help.
Other issues:

Dim a, b As String is equivalent to Dim a As Variant, b As String. To declare multiple String variables you need to write Dim a As String, b As String
CreateObject(""MSXML2.XMLHTTP"") accesses the older version 3.0 of MSXML2. To access the most recent version 6.0, you need CreateObject(""MSXML2.XMLHTTP.6.0"")

","This seems to be a design choice for the Base64 encoders, one of them chose to use the _ character and one of them chose to use the / character (C# also uses the + character instead of the - character). If you need to use that string across languages you can use myString.replace(oldChar, newChar) (myString.Replace(oldChar, newChar) in C#) to replace the mismatch characters.

If you want C# Base64 strings to look like Java's Base64 strings you can use Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens.Base64UrlEncoder, but this is a Nuget package you would have to install. This uses - and _ instead of + and /.

I believe it may have something to do with the string to byte encoding, but I cannot pinpoint what exactly is causing the issue. When I was testing my HMAC code, I had to rely on online generators because I couldn't find vectors for HMAC-SHA224 and HMAC-SHA256. Some calculators would give me completely different output values for the same key, message combination. That could be because of how they are processing the inputs, but I am not sure. I would appreciate it if someone more experienced could help me out with this.
EDIT: This problem is solved. Seems that all that was needed was to pass int as a binary string of length 4. I updated the code with the fixes.
EDIT 2: I read the standard again to realize the solution was in my face the entire time (standard says to encode i as a 32-bit big endian integer).
","The solution was to convert int to a binary string of length 4. Thanks to @EgorSkriptunoff for his insight.

","For password storage, you need more than a mere hash function; you need:

an extremely slow hash function (so that brute force attacks are more difficult)
and a salt: a publicly known value, stored along the hash, distinct for each hash password, and entering in the password hashing process. The salt prevents an attacker from efficiently attacking several passwords (e.g. using precomputed hash tables).

So you need bcrypt.
For the point of the hash output size: if that size is n bits, then n shall be such that an attacker cannot realistically compute the hash function 2n times; 80 bits are quite enough for that. An output of 128 bits is thus already overkill. You still would not want to use MD5, because it is way too fast (100000 nested invocations of MD5 might be slow enough, though) and because some structural weaknesses have been found in MD5, which do not directly impact its security for hashing passwords, but are bad public relations nonetheless. Anyway, you should use bcrypt, not a homemade structure.

Example:
Manual hash using sha256:

","It is base64 encoded.

","There's two things going on here.
First, your manual hash is using a different algorithm than htpasswd. The -s flag causes htpasswd to use SHA1, not SHA256. Use sha1sum instead of sha256sum.
Second, the encoding of the hashes are different. Your manual hash is Hex encoded, the htpasswd hash is Base64 encoded. The htpasswd hash will decode, it just decodes to binary. If you try to print this binary it will look like =¥AU™¨Â@+ºPöÆ'f (depending on what character encoding you're using), and that may be why you believe it's not decoding.
If you convert the Base64 directly to Hex (you can use an online tool like this one), you'll find that sha1sum will generate the same hash.

My friend explained that piping ""asdf"" to sha256sum is showing the checksum, which is not the actual hash itself.

Your friend is incorrect. You're seeing the Hex encoding of the hash. But the piping does affect the hash that's generated, it adds a newline character, so what you're actually hashing is asdf\n. Use this command instead:
echo -n ""asdf"" | sha1sum

Unfortunately it seems my signature is wrong, but after decoding the PKCS7 signature I double checked the hash is sha256WithRSAEncryption, so after verifying this digest I get another hash than the one I computed. 
My /SubFilter is: 
$ grep -aPo '/SubFilter.*?(?=>)' dummy-signed.pdf
/SubFilter/adbe.pkcs7.detached/Type/Sig

And my PDF version is: 
$ grep -aPo '%PDF-\d.\d' dummy-signed.pdf
%PDF-1.6

So from PDF32000 with adbe.pkcs7.detached and PDF 1.6 the HASH should be SHA256 which is compatible with what I found in the PKCS7. 
Just for the record, the hash I get from the signature is: 
#!/bin/bash

You try to extract the wrong hash value from the signature container.
In detail
I didn't recognize this earlier because I'm not really an openssl expert. Analyzing the example PDF, though, the cause of the confusion became clear.
In a PKCS#7 / CMS signature container there usually are (at least) two hash values of interest:

the hash value of the signed document data in the messageDigest signed attribute and
the hash value of the signed attributes (in case of the old RSA signing scheme) in the encrypted signature bytes.

The messageDigest signed attribute in the signature container in your example document looks like this (appearances might differ if you asn1-dump in openssl but the value should be recognizable nonetheless):
5306   47: . . . . . . SEQUENCE {
    <06 09>
5308    9: . . . . . . . OBJECT IDENTIFIER messageDigest (1 2 840 113549 1 9 4)
         : . . . . . . . . (PKCS #9)
    <31 22>
5319   34: . . . . . . . SET {
    <04 20>
5321   32: . . . . . . . . OCTET STRING    
         : . . . . . . . . . 04 B6 9F 55 F1 2F A5 CC    ...U./..
         : . . . . . . . . . 79 23 F4 30 71 54 F2 70    y#.0qT.p
         : . . . . . . . . . 2E FD E4 3B 32 E4 A8 D9    ...;2...
         : . . . . . . . . . DB B0 50 7A 56 FC EC D3                            
         : . . . . . . . . }
         : . . . . . . . }
         : . . . . . . }

As you can recognize, this attribute contains the hash value you calculated.
You on the other hand try to extract the signed hash value from the decrypted signature bytes which is not the hash of the document but instead the hash of the signed attributes!
Additionally something appears to go wrong in that extraction step, the value you should retrieve is
AB86B27177E388A1EE69A5C7479D74621E84473E0CAB5C647471B724FEFCE826

","A hash function is a ONE WAY function, this means that you can't ever get your original data back from the hash.
A hash function is not an encryption function. You can imagine a hash function as a ""fingerprint"" - it identifies the data, but it's not the data itself.
To encrypt your data, use an encryption function, not a hash function.

Expected Output, according to this:

Here is my code:
Set the working variables to the constants specified in FIPS-180
a = int('6a09e667', 16)
b = int('bb67ae85', 16)
c = int('3c6ef372', 16)
d = int('a54ff53a', 16)
e = int('510e527f', 16)
f = int('9b05688c', 16)
g = int('1f83d9ab', 16)
h = int('5be0cd19', 16)

Set the two important variables that depend on value t:
W = int('61626380', 16)
K = int('428a2f98', 16)

From the pseudo code on wikipedia:
S1 = hash.ROTR(e, 6) ^ hash.ROTR(e, 11) ^ hash.ROTR(e, 25)
ch = (e & f) ^ ((~e) & g)#((e1) & g)
temp1 = (h + S1 + ch + K + W) % math.pow(2, 32)
S0 = hash.ROTR(a, 2) ^ hash.ROTR(a, 13) ^ hash.ROTR(a, 22)
maj = (a & b) ^ (a & c) ^ (b & c)
temp2 = (S0 + maj) % math.pow(2, 32)
a = int((temp1 + temp2) % math.pow(2, 32))

ROTR function:
@staticmethod
def ROTR(x, n, w=32):
    return (x >> n) | (x << w - n)

Or, split into functions, like specified in FIPS-180 (Prodcuces the same output)
T1 = int((h + hash.SIGMA1(e) + hash.Ch(e, f, g) + hash.K[t] + W) % math.pow(2, 32))
T2 = int((hash.SIGMA0(a) + hash.Maj(a, b, c)) % math.pow(2, 32))
a = int((T1 + T2) % math.pow(2, 32))

Hash class:
@staticmethod
def ROTR(x, n, w=32):
    return (x >> n) | (x << w - n)
def SIGMA0(x):
    return hash.ROTR(x, 2) ^ hash.ROTR(x, 13) ^ hash.ROTR(x, 22)
def SIGMA1(x):
    return hash.ROTR(x, 6) ^ hash.ROTR(x, 11) ^ hash.ROTR(x, 25)
def Ch(x, y, z):
    return (x & y) ^ (~x & z)
def Maj(x, y, z):
    return (x & y) ^ (x & z) ^ (y & z)

I'm using Python 3 btw. Thanks in advance.
","You need to add a lot more masking here to cut down overflowing bits. For example, your ROTR:
def ROTR(x, n, w=32):
    return (x >> n) | (x << w - n)

leaves all the high bits of x intact above the w boundary; you'd want to construct a mask from w and mask off the high bits, e.g.:
def ROTR(x, n, w=32):
    return ((x >> n) | (x << w - n)) & ((1 << w) - 1)

Similar masks are needed anytime you might have overflowed the assumed ""register width"". They can also replace the error-prone use of % math.pow(2, 32) you've got going on, changing:
int((temp1 + temp2) % math.pow(2, 32))

to:
(temp1 + temp2) & ((1 << 32) - 1)

or equivalently:
(temp1 + temp2) % 2 ** 32

This also needs to happen for bitwise negation where the overflow isn't as obvious: Python's ints are infinite precision, and bitwise negation of a non-negative value makes a negative value, effectively adding infinite 1 bits on the left (in the pseudo-two's complement behavior the language specifies). So ~x must become ~x & ((1 << 32) - 1) or the like to force it back to a positive value containing only the low 32 bits.
This has to be done globally (so temp1 and temp2 are actually int, not float values when you compute with them). In general, math.pow is completely useless; you either want to use the ** operator (which doesn't coerce to float and executes more efficiently) or the built-in pow function (which is only needed for its three argument for doing efficient modular exponentiation).

","You say you want to calculate SHA-256 checksum, yet you do:
hasherSha256 := sha1.New()

That will be an SHA-1 hasher, not SHA-256. Instead do:
hasherSha256 := sha256.New()

Also note that to calculate a ""one-time"" digest of some data (ready in a byte slice), you may use the sha256.Sum256() function like this:

"53041646","Hash from object's content as object ID: fast alternatives for SHA256","I'm working on design of Content-addressable storage, so I'm looking for a hash function to generate object identifiers. Every object should get short ID based on its content in that way: object_id = hash(object_content).
Prerequisites:

Hash-function should be fast. 
Collision probability must be as low as possible. 
Optimal ID length is 32 bytes in order to address 256^32 objects at max (but this requirement may be relaxed).

Taking into account these requirements, I picked up SHA256 hash, but unfortunately it's not fast enough for my purposes. The fastest implementations of SHA256 that I was able to benchmark were openssl and boringssl: on my desktop Intel Core I5 6400 it gave about 420 MB/s per core. Other implementations (like crypto/rsa in Go) are even slower. I would like to replace SHA256 with other hash function that provides the same collision guarantees as SHA256, but gives betters throughput (at least 600 MB/s per core).
Please share your opinion about possible options to solve this problem.
Also I would like to note that hardware update (like purchasing modern CPU with AVX512 instruction set) is not possible. The main point is to find hash function that will provide better performance on commodity hardware.
","Check out Cityhash and HighwayHash. Both have 256-bit variants, and much faster than SHA256. Cityhash is faster, but it is a non-cryptographic hash. HighwayHash is slower (but still faster than SHA256), and a secure hash.
All modern non-cryptographic hashes are much faster than SHA256. If you're willing to use a 128-bit hash, you'll have more options.
Note, that you may want to consider using a 128-bit hash, as it may be adequate for your purpose. For example, if you have 1010 different objects, the probability that you have a collision with a quality 128-bit hash is less than 10-18. Check out the table here.

","Don't know why you'd do this, but here's a solution for you.
Here's some assumptions.

You were given two date hashes (two inputs)
You know exactly how the date hashes were created (EG: always in the format of YYYY-MM-DD)
You know the range of your target date (So you can reverse the hash back to the original date)

So in psudocode, you'd do something like this.
date getDateFromHash(string inputHash) {
  date startDate = '1911-01-01';
  date endDate = '2017-12-31';
  for(date checkDate = startDate; checkDate < endDate; checkDate + 1 day) {
    if (sha1(checkDate) = inputHash) { return checkDate }
  }
  return null;
}
date firstDate = getDateFromHash(""0b10f03fb245a6486d6ab5b25a2f050bf87093a5""); // 2017-09-07
date secondDate = getDateFromHash(""34152f3661d73490ac89b0fe15cb3170aac06bb8""); // 2017-09-06
if (firstDate > secondDate) {
    return true;
} else {
    return false;
} // compare using default date operators

But honestly speaking, like the comment says, there's no point of hashing date values. Hence why I'm only dropping a quich psudo code for you just to point you in the right direction, if you seriously want to tread down this path.

What the online tool is returning you is the representation of that value in hexadecimal format.
Notice that you're getting, (with the tool) 64 bytes IE 64 characters when 256-bit is equal to 32 bytes (32 charaters you may think).
That is because to represent a whole byte in hexadecimal format 2 characters are needed. 4 most significative bits take one character and the other less significative bits take another one.

How do I (using Ruby) convert my original cleartext password to the SCRAM-SHA-1/SCRAM-SHA-256 versions seen above?
The docs writes this about SCRAM:

In the implementation of SCRAM authentication mechanisms (e.g. SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256), drivers MUST maintain a cache of computed SCRAM credentials. The cache entries SHOULD be identified by the password, salt, iteration count, and a value that uniquely identifies the authentication mechanism (e.g. ""SHA1"" or ""SCRAM-SHA-256"").
The cache entry value MUST be either the saltedPassword parameter or the combination of the clientKey and serverKey parameters.

","You are grouping on a byte[]. Unfortunately, .NET collections to not support equality and hashing. This means that you get reference comparison by default. (My opinion: This is a design flaw in the .NET framework. There should be no default equality. An error should be thrown in cases like this.)
Write yourself an IEqualityComparer<byte[]>.
Also, you are ordering before the grouping. Grouping does not preserver ordering. The docs do not guarantee that so it can't be relied on. And in fact it does not hold in practice.

I managed to concatenate the two values (mac address + datetime) and converted it to char array
addressDateTime.toCharArray(thisThing, 28);

However, I'm kind of lost as to how to continue.
I've also tried to read the resulting char* with this cycle but I'm not understanding why it doesn't work:
void loop() {
  while (!timeClient.update()) {
    timeClient.forceUpdate();
  }
  String addressDateTime = getPayload(); //this gets the *aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ffYYmmDDhhMMss* string
  char* hashThis;
  addressDateTime.toCharArray(hashThis, 28);

  for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(hashThis); i++) {
    char str[3];
    sprintf(str, ""%02x"", hashThis[i]);
    Serial.print(str);
  }
  delay(5000);
}

Am I converting the String to char* correctly?
How should I go about Hashing the char*?
Or can I Hash the String without converting it to to char*?
Update:
My code's looking like this atm
  while (!timeClient.update()) {
    timeClient.forceUpdate();
  }
  String addressDateTime = getPayload();
  char hashThis[30];
  addressDateTime.toCharArray(hashThis, 30);

  for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(hashThis); i++) {
    Serial.printf(""%02x"", hashThis[i]);
  }
  delay(5000);
}

So I managed to convert the String to Char* Except that the output is looking like this 33433a37313a42463a31443a34323a463431393035303531343038323700 instead of (for example) aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff190505141037
After figuring out why my char* array outputs like that I still have to hash it. 
Thanks for helping me get this far, I still have ways to go
","You're not allocating space to store the C string that you're getting from addressDateTime.
hashThis is a char* which is a pointer to a character. It hasn't been set to anything so it's just... random. Which will almost certainly make your program crash or at least misbehave badly.
Given your code, the quickest fix is to change
    char* hashThis;

to
    char hasThis[30];
    addressDateTime.toCharArray(hashThis, 30);

I changed 28 to 30 because aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ffYYmmDDhhMMss is actually 29 characters long and also requires an extra byte for the C string null terminator character. I'm not 100% sure if the toCharArray() method sets the null terminator; if it doesn't, you'd need to add
    hasThis[29] = '\0';

You can avoid that by just using the String c_str() method, which returns a char* to the internal buffer that String uses to hold the string.
In that case you could rewrite
    char* hashThis;
    addressDateTime.toCharArray(hashThis, 28);

as
    char* hashThis = addressDateTime.c_str();

By the way, you can also just do
    Serial.printf(""%02x"", hashThis[i]);

and dispense with the snprintf(). Kudos on getting the right buffer size there, though!
UPDATE
In your updated question, you said that you're expecting to see output that looks like:
aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff190505141037

instead of:
33433a37313a42463a31443a34323a463431393035303531343038323700

Your code is
for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(hashThis); i++) {
  Serial.printf(""%02x"", hashThis[i]);
}

You're writing each character as a two digit hexadecimal number, so you're going to see the number in hexadecimal that represents the character, not the character itself. If you want to see the characters, do:
for (int i = 0; i < strlen(hashThis); i++) {
  Serial.printf(""%c"", hashThis[i]);
}

or (better)
for (int i = 0; i < strlen(hashThis); i++) {
  Serial.print(hashThis[i]);
}

or (best)
Serial.println(hashThis);

Note that I changed your sizeof to a strlen. If for some reason you put a shorter string in hashThis, strlen will do the right thing whereas sizeof will always return the length that hashThis was declared with rather than the length of the string in it.

It look completely magical to me. I need to have the same hash (strResult) in Java. My Java looks like this: 
 byte[] bytes = text.getBytes( ""UTF-8"" );
 MessageDigest messageDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance( ""SHA-256"" );
 byte[] hash = messageDigest.digest( bytes );

 StringBuffer hexString = new StringBuffer();
 for( int i = 0; i < hash.length; i++ )
 {
     String hex = Integer.toHexString( 0xff & hash[ i ] );
     if( hex.length() == 1 )
     {
         hexString.append( '0' );
     }
     hexString.append( hex );
 }

Does anyone know how to do that?
","I found solution. Correct Java code should look like this:
byte[] bytes = text.getBytes( ""UTF-8"" );
MessageDigest messageDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance( ""SHA-256"" );
byte[] hash = messageDigest.digest( bytes );
String result = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(hash);

","SHA256 is a one way function, this means that given the output of SHA256, it is very, very difficult and time consuming to compute an input. So time consuming that it is impractical on current hardware.
So instead you have to use a brute force attack: hash millions of potential passwords until you find one that produces the same hash as stored in the database. Note that this must not necessarily be the original password (hash collision).
If we assume that the user did not use a combination of random characters, the search space can be reduced by using a Dictionary attack.
You can reduce computation time by using more storage space with Rainbow tables.

","You can also avoid using sprintf() and make a more efficient funcion like this
void
hash2digest(char *result, const char *const hash, size_t length)
{
    const char *characters = ""0123456789abcdef"";
    for (size_t i = 0 ; i < length ; ++i)
    {
        result[2 * i] = characters[(hash[i] >> 0x04) & 0x0F];
        result[2 * i + 1] = characters[hash[i] & 0x0F];
    }
    result[2 * length] = '\0';    
}

Note that you can call it from wherever you want just like this (assuming hash is already declared and defined)
char digest[65];
hash2digest(digest, hash, 32);

This in turn can be reused for SHA1 for example, like this
char digest[41];
hash2digest(digest, hash, 20);

And using dynamic memory allocation
char *
hash2digest(const char *const hash, size_t length)
{
    const char *characters = ""0123456789abcdef"";
    char *result;
    result = malloc(2 * length + 1);
    if (result == NULL)
        return NULL;
    for (size_t i = 0 ; i < length ; ++i)
    {
        result[2 * i] = characters[(hash[i] >> 0x04) & 0x0F];
        result[2 * i + 1] = characters[hash[i] & 0x0F];
    }
    result[2 * length] = '\0';

    return result;

","This line:
W[t] = SSIG1(W[t-2]) + W[t-7] + SSIG0(t-15) + W[t-16];

Should be
W[t] = SSIG1(W[t-2]) + W[t-7] + SSIG0(W[t-15]) + W[t-16];

The problem kicks in on iteration 16 because that's when you first refer to a value buffered using that assignment (earlier values were just copies of the initial block).

This is problem set 9 in Harvards' CS50 computer science course. My program compiles, functions and passes all checks. However, the past few days I've been stuck trying to implement a password change option. 
On the password change page, I prompt the user to input their old password. Then, the user has to input their desired new password. Finally, the user has to confirm their new password once more.
However, my hashing function seems to output a different hash when a user inputs their old password, than it did when they registered with this password. This causes my comparison check between the hashed password in the database and the user input to always return false.
Below is the python code for the implementation of the password change. Below it is the html code for the actual page on which the user can change their password.

","As pointed in this answer some libraries generate the salt itself, you don't supply one. In this library, you can only supply the salt size. From the doc
werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash(password, method='pbkdf2:sha256', salt_length=8)


Hash a password with the given method and salt with a string of the given length. The format of the string returned includes the method that was used so that check_password_hash() can check the hash.
The format for the hashed string looks like this:

method$salt$hash

If you want to store the salt, parse it from the result. But this library has another function to check/verify the passwords;
werkzeug.security.check_password_hash(pwhash, password)


check a password against a given salted and hashed password value.

So;
In sign-up login, or to change passwords use;
generate_password_hash

To verify the passwords, use;
check_password_hash

Last I read the best options were scrypt, bcrypt, or pbkdf2. If you can't use those then I recommend sha512 with many thousands of iterations. One of the benefits of using passlib CryptContext is you can update your scheme later as needed (and as better implementations become available) while keeping easy compatibility with previously stored passwords. sha512_crypt is very easy to implement on GAE with passlib CryptContext.

","You can group your workers under a BalancingPool which will automatically distribute work to idle actors, with the manager and worker actors using work pulling to prevent the mailbox from growing too large.

The manager accepts two message types: work-request and work-complete.  Work-request is called by a worker when it has completed X tasks (where X is, say, 10), signalling the manager to add X more tasks to the BalancingPool.  Work-complete is called when a worker has found an appropriate string prefix, at which point the manager sends out a stop command to the BalancingPool instructing it to immediately terminate and to also terminate its workers.  Aside from this, the manager is responsible for initially filling the BalancingPool with sufficient prefixes for the workers to test (say, 20 * workerCount), and refilling the pool every time it receives a work-request message.
The workers accept one message type: test-prefix, which contains a string prefix for the worker to test.  It also needs to maintain a count of messages that it has received and processed, and when this count reaches X then it is zeroed and the worker sends a work-request message to the manager.

This macro is used in this context:

low  = ( ctx->total[0] <<  3 );

Problem is that total is defined as a table of long:
unsigned long total[2];     /*!< number of bytes processed  */

So now, if total saves the number of bytes processed it's very likely that total[0] can be greater than 256 (that's probably the reason why it's defined as long), so I don't know what would be the effect of casting this long to unsigned char in PUT_UINT32_BE macro? Would that get fist x bytes or last bytes or total[0] % 256?
","The macro simply puts the single 8-bit entities of a 32-bit value into a byte-array, starting from some offset. This is done with the shift operation: The first shift get the top 8 bits (bits 24 to 31), the next shift get bits 16 to 23, then bits 8 to 15, and lastly bits 0 to 7.
If you do the opposite, i.e. get the bytes from the array and put them together as a 32-bit value you will get your original value back.

the function is not complex, but I don't know its mathematical means and usage.

My fault, I did't ask the question very clear. In different environments which use different endian representation, it is clear, this function will keep the data in a same meaning, but under the same endian representation, what does it means? 
It absolutely will change the meaning of the data, or there is some other reason to swap it?
","In the pseudocode for SHA256  on wikipedia it says

Pre-processing: append the bit '1' to the message append k bits '0',
  where k is the minimum number >= 0 such that the resulting message
      length (modulo 512 in bits) is 448. append length of message (without the '1' bit or padding), in bits, as 64-bit big-endian
  integer
      (this will make the entire post-processed length a multiple of 512 bits)

x86/x86_64 Linux and Unix are small endian.
It's converting the length of the message to big endian to add it to the end of the message, which it does in the source at L105 of sha256.c, and that section of the code is the only place where the swapE64 function is called:

So currently I'm having the user input a string password, passing it thru sha256 and returning a key and iv from it.(Half of the hash is the key and half is IV). Ive Read that The IV should be different for each file encrypted so i may change it up a bit, but before i do i just wanted to see if sha256 was even a good method to do this. My code is as follows: 
public Tuple<byte[],byte[]> Fetch_Password(string password)

What exactly are you decoding and encoding?



import hashlib
transaction_hex = ""93a05cac6ae03dd55172534c53be0738a50257bb3be69fff2c7595d677ad53666e344634584d07b8d8bc017680f342bc6aad523da31bc2b19e1ec0921078e872""

","header_hex is a regular string of lower case ASCII characters and the decode() method with 'hex' argument changes it to a (binary) string (or bytes object in Python 3) with bytes 0x93 0xa0 etc. In C it would be an array of unsigned char of length 64 in this case.
This array/byte string of length 64 is then hashed with SHA256 and its result (another binary string of size 32) is again hashed. So hash is a string of length 32, or a bytes object of that length in Python 3. Then encode('hex_codec') is a synomym for encode('hex') (in Python 2); in Python 3, it replaces it (so maybe this code is meant to work in both versions). It outputs an ASCII (lower hex) string again that replaces each raw byte (which is just a small integer) with a two character string that is its hexadecimal representation. So the final bit reverses the double hash and outputs it as hexadecimal, to a form which I usually call ""lowercase hex ASCII"".

","First a suggestion to improve the token, instead of using the hex representation i would recommend to use base62 encoding. Such a string contains both upper and lower case characters and can therefore be shorter with the same information.
Next let's assume you create a random token with 20 base62 encoded characters, this would allow for 700'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000 combinations! Even if you can brute-force with 15 Giga SHA256/second, it would take about 7E17 years to find the correct token. Such a token with 20 characters requires only 15 bytes, so the 33 bytes you suggested in your first approach is surely more than enough.
I wrote a small class to help generating such base62 tokens, have a look at it if you are interested.

Both codes looks same only the syntax is different. Can someone help me get the same result in swift as I used to get in Objective C? Below are the code samples from both languages.
Objective C:
NSString* key = @""1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234"";

NSData *hash = [[NSData alloc] initWithBytes:cHMAC length:sizeof(cHMAC)];
 NSString* encryptedString = hash.base64Encoding;

Swift:
let key = ""1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234""

let cData = ""message"".cString(using: .ascii)!
var digest = [CUnsignedChar](repeating: 0, count: Int(CC_SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH))
CCHmac(CCHmacAlgorithm(kCCHmacAlgSHA256), cKey, cKey.count, cData, cData.count, &digest)
let hash = Data(digest)
let encryptedString = hash.base64EncodedString()

","The problem is that cKey and cData include the terminating null character of the strings, and in the Swift version that is counted in cKey.count and cData.count, whereas in the Objective-C version strlen(cKey) and strlen(cData) do not count the terminating null character of the strings.
Doing
 CCHmac(CCHmacAlgorithm(kCCHmacAlgSHA256), cKey, strlen(key), cData, strlen(""message"", &digest)

instead would fix the issue in your example, but is not safe for non-ASCII characters.
What I actually would do is to convert the strings to Data values (which do not include a terminating null byte) with the UTF-8 representation. Then pass the underlying byte buffers to the encryption method:
let key = ""1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234""
let cKey = Data(key.utf8)
let cData = Data(""message"".utf8)
var digest = [CUnsignedChar](repeating: 0, count: Int(CC_SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH))
cKey.withUnsafeBytes { keyPtr in
    cData.withUnsafeBytes { dataPtr in
    CCHmac(CCHmacAlgorithm(kCCHmacAlgSHA256), keyPtr.baseAddress, cKey.count, dataPtr.baseAddress, cData.count, &digest)
    }
}
let hash = Data(digest)
let encryptedString = hash.base64EncodedString()

Edit
As a result of your comments, which I do not understand at all.
Files of type .reg are usually required to be run as administrator, the specific location within the registry is not considered.
Here are three different scripts, each using the commands which could have been retrieved from your own registry, after having made the replacements I suggested above and merging either the .reg files or my above 'batch' script:
Get-MD5.cmd
@Echo Off
SetLocal EnableDelayedExpansion
For /F ""Delims="" %%A In ('CertUtil -hashfile ""%~1"" MD5^|FindStr/V "":""') Do Set ""hash=%%A""&Set/P ""=!hash: =!""<Nul|Clip

Get-SHA1.cmd
@Echo Off
SetLocal EnableDelayedExpansion
For /F ""Delims="" %%A In ('CertUtil -hashfile ""%~1"" SHA1^|FindStr/V "":""') Do Set ""hash=%%A""&Set/P ""=!hash: =!""<Nul|Clip

Get-SHA256.cmd
@Echo Off
SetLocal EnableDelayedExpansion
For /F ""Delims="" %%A In ('CertUtil -hashfile ""%~1"" SHA256^|FindStr/V "":""') Do Set ""hash=%%A""&Set/P ""=!hash: =!""<Nul|Clip

Please note I used the extension .cmd for my 'batch' scripts but you can change it to .bat if you feel more comfortable living in the last century.

static byte[] sha2(byte[] message) {

I can just convert my object to byte[], but I don't think it's a good idea to store big array in memory just to create 32 byte array. So how can I compute sha2(or maybe another crypto hash function) of object? 
","You do not have to load the whole object into memory, you can load parts of it into temporary buffer.
Dump object into a temporary file using FileOutputStream/BufferedOutputStream, this will make sure serialized object does not pollute JVM memory.
The load serialize object from temporary file using FileInputStream/BufferedInputStream and feed it to MessageDigest#update(buf) method in a loop.
Finally call MessageDigest#digest() to finish work:
int[] buf = new int[1024];
while (/* has more data */) {
    int readBytes = readIntoBuf(buf);
    sha256.update(buf, 0, readBytes);
}
return sha256.digest();

If you can afford to store entire serialized object in memory, use ByteArrayOutputStream and pass result byte[] to MessageDigest#digest(buf):
try (ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOuputStream(baos)) {
    oos.writeObject(obj);

Serial.print((micros() - ms));

Serial.println();

What I am wanting to do is to rename the Sha256.print to Sha256.Msg. I have tried to rename the class Sha256Class : public Print to class Sha256Class : public Msg but that did not work.

","You should simply just have to change the name of the prototype in the header file, then change the name of the definition of the implementation in the cpp file, and finally remember to change the name where you are using it. 
.h:
size_t print(const char* str); to size_t Msg(const char * str)

.cpp:
size_t Sha256Class::print(const char *str){
    return write_L(str);
}

to

size_t Sha256Class::Msg(const char *str){
    return write_L(str);
}

arduino file:
uint8_t* hash;
uint32_t a;
unsigned long ms;
Serial.println(""Test: RFC4231 4.2"");
Serial.println(""Expect:b0344c61d8db38535ca8afceaf0bf12b881dc200c9833da726e9376c2e32cff7"");
Serial.print(""Result:"");
ms = micros();
Sha256.initHmac(hmacKey1,20);
/* change from Sha256.print(""Hi There"") to */
Sha256.Msg(""Hi There"");
printHash(Sha256.resultHmac());
Serial.print("" Hash took : "");
Serial.print((micros() - ms));
Serial.println("" micros"");
Serial.println();

However, since you have a #if  defined(SHA256_LINUX) around the prototype in the header file it could possibly not be declared as Msg(const char *str) instead of print(const char *str) so the best solution would just be to leave the print function implemented and create a second method that does the same thing.
In response to the comment.
.h:
// Add this somewhere in the code wherever you see fit
size_t Msg(const char * str);

.cpp:
//Add this somewhere in the cide wherever you see fit
size_t Sha256Class::Msg(const char *str){
    return write_L(str);
}

And in the arduino file just call the function as you wanted it to be with the new name Sha256.Msg(""Hi There"");

","You can use DigestUtils class functions for encryption in general and in particular for your case it would be DigestUtils.sha256Hex()
The following statement:
vars.put('foo', org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils.sha256Hex('bar'))

will store SHA-256 encoded hash of bar line into foo JMeter Variable, you will be able to access it as ${foo} where required
vars stands for JMeterVariables class instance and it provides read/write access to all JMeter Variables in current thread context. Check out Top 8 JMeter Java Classes You Should Be Using with Groovy article to learn more about this and other JMeter API shorthands available for Groovy scripts.

Is above approach better?

Is there a way to ask yocto/swupdate layer to generate sha256 for all above files(except sw-description) and add these generated sha256 into sw-description file?
I can sign sw-description by defining SWUPDATE_SIGNING andSWUPDATE_PRIVATE_KEY variables in my recipe file but 

how to generate sha256?

","meta-swupdate Yocto layer takes care of signed images.
Swupdate image recipe should contain for example:
SWUPDATE_SIGNING = ""RSA"" 
SWUPDATE_PRIVATE_KEY = ""/path/to/key""

Then, sha256 is automatically computed in sw-description file with following syntax:
sha256 = ""@panther2-usb-panther2.ext4"";

Where panther2-usb-panther2.ext4 is an artifact listed in SWUPDATE_IMAGES variable.

Any ideas on what I can try? 
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
","Looking at passlib's documentation the encrypt() method takes a secret as a parameter and this secret must be in either unicode or bytes:
classmethod PasswordHash.encrypt(secret, **kwds)

Parameters: 
secret (unicode or bytes) – string containing the password to encode.
If it isn't in unicode or bytes this method will throw a TypeError as you're seeing in your screenshot:
TypeError:

if secret is not unicode or bytes.
if a keyword argument had an incorrect type.
if a required keyword was not provided.

You could try encoding your password string into Unicode before attempting to call the encrypt() method and seeing if this resolves your error. Something along the lines of:
password_utf=form_reg.password.data.encode()
password = sha256_crypt().encrypt(password_utf)

Alternatively, maybe you could try hashing your form password like the following instead:
# generate new salt, hash password

password = sha256_crypt.hash(form_reg.password.data))

Hopefully that helps!

After reading various articles () for last 2 days confused to chose one. Most of them say, MD5, SHA 1 is broken which being shipped with .net framework. some say SHA 2 (either 256, 512) is ok whereas other say it vulnerable too. while PBKDF, bcrypt, scrypt being recommended but they are slow when it comes to performance. Now confused which algorithm to choose considering security, compatibility, etc. Is there any new solutions .net 4.5 provides or shipped with C# 6.0?
If bcrypt.net is to be used, what need to be set as work factor (ie how many iterations recommended minimum)?

The output of the script with the text file containing only one hash and name looks like this:

As you can see this works perfectly, but a '\n' gets appended to the hash both times it gets printed. I suppose that is the reason why the very last print throws a 'TypeError: Incorrect padding'.
The problem is: I don't know how to make this work since both name and hash would get written in the same line if I remove the '\n'. I tried to write the lines in the text file both manually and with a script using 
file = open(""hashes.txt"",""w"")
file.write(hash)
file.write(""Fabian"")

but this doesn't solve the problem. Note: the text file looks like this:
hash0
name0
hash1
name1

A cryptographic hash function is a hash function which is considered

[CatalogFiles]
<HASH>manifest.json=.\manifest.json
<HASH>bsi.json=.\bsi.json

However, this causes the catalog file's entries to be tagged by their hash, instead of their filename, when viewing the .cat file in Windows Explorer. You can somewhat work around this by adding a custom attribute to display the filename in the catalog entry's details, as follows:
[CatalogFiles]
<HASH>manifest.json=.\manifest.json
<HASH>manifest.jsonATTR1=0x11010001:File:manifest.json
<HASH>bsi.json=.\bsi.json
<HASH>bsi.jsonATTR1=0x11010001:File:bsi.json

The attribute type is composed of (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/seccrypto/makecat):

0x10000000: attribute is included in the catalog's hash
0x01000000: don't create a duplicated attribute with SHA1 hash (when using SHA256 and catalog version 2)
0x00010000: attribute is in plaintext, not base64
0x00000001: attribute is a keyvalue pair (e.g. File=bsi.json)

I discovered this workaround after running into the same problem as you when I found this example here: https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~heha/viewzip.cgi/basteln/PC/USB2LPT/usb2lpt.zip/src/Makefile?auto=MAK

","There is confusion in your question. Signature generation for RSA requires modular exponentiation using the values of the private key, not the public key. Modular exponentiation is also used for encryption with the public key. But although the same mathematical formula is used - at least on the surface - doesn't mean that signature generation is encryption with the private key because such a thing does not exist. Current PKCS#1 standards go out of their way to explain this fact, even though earlier PKCS#1 standards used to identify signature generation with RSA encryption.
What you are trying to do is to verify the message. That's the function you would expect rather than sign. Verification is performed by a trusted public key, not by a private key. You are not trying to decode the message, you are trying to verify that the bytes of the message are indeed signed by the private key that belongs to the same key pair as the trusted public key. Generally, the message is not recovered, not even partially. PKCS#1 is called signature generation with appendix, which contrasts with other schemes called signature generation giving message recovery. The appendix is the signature value, it needs to be appended (included with) the message to be of any use.
Actually, the fact that you can at least recover the hash over the message is specific to some schemes like PKCS#1 signature generation (officially called RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 in the standard). Other schemes such as PSS in the same standard may not even recover the hash. This is OK as long the verification (which can take place given the data and therefore hash) can succeed or fail. In other words, the verification should at least result in a boolean true / false, but it doesn't need to generate any other information.
Or, in simplified pseudo-code:
ciphertext = encrypt(publicKey, plaintext)
(recovered) plaintext = decrypt(privateKey, ciphertext)

and
signature = sign(privateKey, data)
verificationResult = verify(publicKey, data, signature)

where the data hashing algorithm is a configuration parameter for the signature generation & verification algorithm. If you want to include it you could e.g. include it as initial parameter:
signature = sign(SHA256alg, privateKey, data)
verificationResult = verify(SHA256alg, publicKey, data, signature)


Finally, you are talking about ""decoding"". You decode messages that have been encoded using an encoding scheme. Encoding/decoding does not presume the presence of a key. We're talking about encryption / decryption and signature generation / verification instead. Examples of encoding are hexadecimals / base 64 that convert binary to text. Character encoding such as UTF-8 is about converting text to binary.

","The convention is to encrypt with a receives public RSA key so that only the holder of the corresponding private key can decrypt the message.
Also by convention, you would use your private RSA key to create a signatur that everybody else with the corresponding public key can verify. 
In principle you could use a public key for creating a signature, but this would be an erroneous use case of the key, and is often prevented in the libraries implementing RSA. In your case you get a ""public key ≠ not private key error"" as you try to use a public key in a sign(..) call.
When signing you don't use the full message as input to RSA, but instead calculates a hash (you use SHA256). This hash would not need to be ""decryped"" in the signature verification, but instead recalculated on the original message, that you want to verify.

The $issuer private key needs to be an instance of RSA for that to work but that's how you'd do it.
It probably ignores the setHash('sha256') thing because (1) not all the hashes you can use with RSA have OIDs that X509.php knows about and (2) options available in RSA - like PSS signatures - aren't supported by X509.php and may not have OIDs defined by any IETF RFC and may not be supported by another other X509 implementation out there.

"34684638","How can I test that signed binaries will validate after Windows starts enforcing the new rules for SHA-1 certificates?","So... Microsoft has announced that SHA-1 code signing certificates are deprecated as of January 1st 2016. I've done a fair bit of reading, I've had our certificate reissued using SHA-256 instead of SHA-1, and I think I understand how to dual-sign binaries so the signatures will validate on older versions of Windows that don't support SHA-256.
Here's the problem: despite the fact that these rules are supposed to apply from January 1st 2016, it doesn't look like Windows has started enforcing them yet. I've signed a number of EXE files with our old SHA-1 certificate, timestamped them with dates after January 1st 2016, and Windows still seems to consider the signatures to be valid (at least on fully-updated installations of Windows 7 and Windows 10). I've checked this by right-clicking on a signed file in Explorer, selecting ""Properties"", then going to the Digital Signatures tab and double-clicking the certificate. It tells me ""The digital signature is OK"".
Am I misunderstanding something here? Or is there some kind of tool that I can use to check that a signed EXE (or MSI, or whatever) will be valid after Windows stops accepting SHA-1 certificates? I don't want to release products now and discover at some point in the future that the signatures are no longer valid. That would be embarrassing.

","It is if you use a salt. sha256 uses an algorithm that is only in one way, you can cipher a string but you cannot revert the operation. The problem is that it exists databases with tons of data of every possible string up to around 12 characters ciphered to the different cipher systems and you can get the original string by querying the database in a matter of seconds. That's why you should use a salt. 
A salt is a predefined long string used as a key joined to your password before the encrypting. As @Jaquarh comments you should create and store a different salt for each user. You can for example generate a random string.
Also you should use data binding to your query to prevent sql injections.
In your code you can make it much more secured the following way:
$salt = substr(md5(rand()), 0, 20) //this will generate a 20 characters random string
$username = $_POST['username'];
$password=  $_POST['password'].$salt;
$sPassword= hash('sha256',$password);

$insertSQLQuery = $conn->prepare(""INSERT INTO tbl_users (username,password) 
VALUES ('?','?')"");
//You may want to validate your $username and $ePassword here
$insertSQLQuery->execute(array($username, $ePassword));

PD: remember that you will need to store that salt to check the password later when the user logs in for example, you will need to add the salt to the password that the user has introduced in the log in form before encrypting and querying the database

","There is no need to use the hash() method and is extremely pointless creating your own hashing techniques when PHP has its own built in functions to achieve this.
password_hash() and password_verify.
Alluding to @David's answer. You should also create a salt: its a unique ""addition"" you concat to the password before hashing it to ensure further security measurements and data integrity. Luckily enough for us, PHP's built in function password_hash() does this when you provide it with the pre defined PASSWORD_BCRYPT algorithm.
FYI: As alluded to by @treyBake your query is open to SQL injections. Make use of prepared statements and do sanity checks!

","To large for a comment!
About:
$sPassword= hash('sha256',$password);
$ePassword= base64_encode($sPassword);

This construct makes no sense. hash('sha256',$password) returns a string of 64 hex digits. base64_encode() blow it up to 88 chars. Both are human readable and so it is useless.
My recommendation: Either you use $sPassword (and skip the second step) or you change your code to:
$sPassword= hash('sha256',$password,true);
//                                 ^^^^^
$ePassword= base64_encode($sPassword);

In this case, hash() returns a string with 32 binary chars and base64_encode() blows it up to 44 chars. And this is smaller than 64 hex digits.
Anyway: Remove the possible SQL injection for $username.

Unfortunately I am not able to get any of them. I have mentioned PHP example below.

"53308897","Certificate signing produces different signature when on server","I am trying to sign some data using a certificate private key.  The issue I'm finding is that the signature is different depending on if I'm executing it locally or on a server.
I'm using the following code as a test, running under the same user both locally and on the server:
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;
using System.Text;

            var alg = CryptoConfig.MapNameToOID(""SHA256"");
            var data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(""test"");
            var sig = key.SignData(data, alg);

            Console.WriteLine(Convert.ToBase64String(sig));

        }

        private static RSACryptoServiceProvider SigningKeyFromCertificate(StoreName storeName, StoreLocation storeLocation, X509FindType findType, string findValue)
        {
            X509Store store = new X509Store(storeName, storeLocation);
            store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);

            var certs = store.Certificates.Find(findType, findValue, false);
            if (certs?.Count > 0)
            {
                var cert = certs[0];
                if (cert.HasPrivateKey)
                {
                    // Force use of Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider to allow use of SHA256.
                    var key = cert.PrivateKey as RSACryptoServiceProvider;
                    var enhanced = new RSACryptoServiceProvider().CspKeyContainerInfo;
                    var parameters = new CspParameters(enhanced.ProviderType, enhanced.ProviderName, key.CspKeyContainerInfo.UniqueKeyContainerName);
                    return new RSACryptoServiceProvider(parameters);
                }
                else
                {
                    throw new Exception($""No private key access to cert '{findValue}.'"");
                }
            }
            else
            {
                throw new Exception($""Cert '{findValue}' not found!"");
            }
        }
    }
}

Locally, I get the following signature:
YUjspKhLl7v3u5VQkh1PfHytMTpEtbAftxOA5v4lmph3B4ssVlZp7KedO5NW9K5L222Kz9Ik9/55NirS0cNCz/cDhEFRtD4daJ9qLRuM8oD5hCj6Jt9Vc6WeS2he+Cqfoylnv4V9plfi1xw8y7EyAf4C77BGkXOdyP5wyz2Xubo=

On the server, I get this one instead:
u1RUDwbBlUpOgNNkAjXhYEWfVLGpMOa0vEfm6PUkB4y9PYBk1lDmCAp+488ta+ipbTdSDLM9btRqsQfZ7JlIn/dIBw9t5K63Y7dcDcc7gDLE1+umLJ7EincMcdwUv3YQ0zCvzc9RrP0jKJManV1ptQNnODpMktGYAq1KmJb9aTY=

Any idea of what could be different?  I would think, with the same certificate, the same code, and the same data, the signature should be the same.
(The example is written in C# 4.5.2.)
","You have some code to reopen the CAPI key handle under PROV_RSA_AES:
// Force use of Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider to allow use of SHA256.
var key = cert.PrivateKey as RSACryptoServiceProvider;
var enhanced = new RSACryptoServiceProvider().CspKeyContainerInfo;

var parameters = new CspParameters(
    enhanced.ProviderType,
    enhanced.ProviderName,
    key.CspKeyContainerInfo.UniqueKeyContainerName);

return new RSACryptoServiceProvider(parameters);

But key.CspKeyContainerInfo.UniqueKeyContainerName isn't the name of the key (it's the name of the file on disk where the key lives), so you're opening a brand new key (you're also generating a new ephemeral key just to ask what the default provider is).  Since it's a named key it persists, and subsequent application executions resolve to the same key -- but a different ""same"" key on each computer.
A more stable way of reopening the key is
var cspParameters = new CspParameters
{
    KeyContainerName = foo.CspKeyContainerInfo.KeyContainerName,
    Flags = CspProviderFlags.UseExistingKey,
};

(since the provider type and name aren't specified they will use the defaults, and by saying UseExistingKey you get an exception if you reference a key that doesn't exist).

That said, the easiest fix is to stop using RSACryptoServiceProvider.  .NET Framework 4.6 (and .NET Core 1.0) have a(n extension) method on X509Certificate2, GetRSAPrivateKey(), it returns an RSA (which you should avoid casting) which is usually RSACng (on Windows), but may be RSACryptoServiceProvider if only CAPI had a driver required for a HSM, and may be some other RSA in the future.  Since RSACng handles SHA-2 better there's almost never a need to ""reopen"" the return object (even if it's RSACryptoServiceProvider, and even if the type isn't PROV_RSA_AES (24), that doesn't mean the HSM will fail to do SHA-2).

Doing this manually is not recommended, since e.g. copy and paste, or other factors can easily distort your ASCII string. So optimally this is written within a program to calculate everything altogether.

To get a better understanding for the process I decided to implement it in python (3.6). By stitching together concepts from various websites like wiki and NIST pages I constructed the following code. I know the process is close to what it should be but when I test it results vary slightly from what they should be. For example, 'a' hashed with SHA-256 should be 'ca978112ca1bbdcafac231b39a23dc4da786eff8147c4e72b9807785afee48bb' however, my program returns 'ca978112ca1bbdcafac231b319a23dc4da786eff81147c4e72b9807785afee48bb'.

","Do not use RSACryptoServiceProvider unless you are doing interop with CAPI, like opening a named key.
To do RSA signing with SHA-(2-)256:
byte[] signature = rsa.SignData(data, HashAlgorithmName.SHA256, RSASignaturePadding.Pkcs1);

You can get the RSA object from a cert:
using (RSA rsa = cert.GetRSAPrivateKey())
{
    ...
}

Or you can make one up from existing RSA parameters:
using (RSA rsa = RSA.Create(rsaParameters))
{

Or you can make up a new key from nothing:

"57439671","How to HMAC SHA256 sign a string with a double array key or an hex string key using google apps script?","Following the AWS example on Signature Version 4, I am trying to reproduce the example using a Google Sheets with Google apps scripting. I face an issue with the kregion signature in the example. While I can confirm that the AWS example is valid using an online signature tool, I am never able to reproduce the example output using any Google app script. As HMAC SHA256 signature works fine for an earlier part of the example (kdate), the issue seems to come from the way data is stored or used.
What works for kDate is the following with parts from another stackoverflow entry to convert byte array to hex string and with the help of Google apps script documentation for computeHmacSha256Signature:
var input=""20120215"";
var key=""AWS4""+""wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"";//Do not worry, this is an example key, not my actual key
var signature=Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(input,key);
signature=signature.map(function(chr){return (chr+256).toString(16).slice(-2)}).join('');//convert byte array to hex string
Logger.log(signature);//valid 969fbb94feb542b71ede6f87fe4d5fa29c789342b0f407474670f0c2489e0a0d

Here is the same thing for the kRegion:
var input=""us-east-1"";
var key=""969fbb94feb542b71ede6f87fe4d5fa29c789342b0f407474670f0c2489e0a0d"";
var signature=Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(input,key);
signature=signature.map(function(chr){return (chr+256).toString(16).slice(-2)}).join('');
Logger.log(signature);//non-valid a59e30f9d899c47b3dd68ea1c0ab3bb529e03a8f4ed2f54cb64af547330a22a0

I am not surprised that it doesn't produce the valid example kRegion output 69daa0209cd9c5ff5c8ced464a696fd4252e981430b10e3d3fd8e2f197d7a70c because the key is stored as a hex string which doesn't make much sense. Here is the same thing with an attempt at decoding the hex string to a byte array inspired from this github entry:
var input=""us-east-1"";
var key=""969fbb94feb542b71ede6f87fe4d5fa29c789342b0f407474670f0c2489e0a0d"";
var a=[];
for(var i=0, len=key.length; i<len; i+=2) {
  a.push(parseInt(key.substr(i,2),16));
}
key=a;
Logger.log(key);//[150.0, 159.0, 187.0, 148.0, 254.0, 181.0, 66.0, 183.0, 30.0, 222.0, 111.0, 135.0, 254.0, 77.0, 95.0, 162.0, 156.0, 120.0, 147.0, 66.0, 176.0, 244.0, 7.0, 71.0, 70.0, 112.0, 240.0, 194.0, 72.0, 158.0, 10.0, 13.0]
var signature=Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(input,key);
signature=signature.map(function(chr){return (chr+256).toString(16).slice(-2)}).join('');
Logger.log(signature);//non-valid ac7a5b21190d18b323886d48cd3c4c7486a0f1dd4edb80d245a221a95f5e689b

Using an online converter, i can confirm that the key is well converted. Yet, the output signature is still wrong.
I was wondering whether it could be because the key bytes are stored as doubles. So, I tried the following with no difference on the output signature:
var input=""us-east-1"";
var key=[0x96, 0x9f, 0xbb, 0x94, 0xfe, 0xb5, 0x42, 0xb7, 0x1e, 0xde, 0x6f, 0x87, 0xfe, 0x4d, 0x5f, 0xa2, 0x9c, 0x78, 0x93, 0x42, 0xb0, 0xf4, 0x07, 0x47, 0x46, 0x70, 0xf0, 0xc2, 0x48, 0x9e, 0x0a, 0x0d];
var signature=Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(input,key);
signature=signature.map(function(chr){return (chr+256).toString(16).slice(-2)}).join('');
Logger.log(signature);//non-valid ac7a5b21190d18b323886d48cd3c4c7486a0f1dd4edb80d245a221a95f5e689b

Then I thought maybe both parameters of the computeHmacSha256Signature function need to be byte arrays:
var input=[0x75, 0x73, 0x2d, 0x65, 0x61, 0x73, 0x74, 0x2d, 0x31];
var key=[0x96, 0x9f, 0xbb, 0x94, 0xfe, 0xb5, 0x42, 0xb7, 0x1e, 0xde, 0x6f, 0x87, 0xfe, 0x4d, 0x5f, 0xa2, 0x9c, 0x78, 0x93, 0x42, 0xb0, 0xf4, 0x07, 0x47, 0x46, 0x70, 0xf0, 0xc2, 0x48, 0x9e, 0x0a, 0x0d];
var signature=Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(input,key);//leads to error ""Cannot convert Array to (class)[].""
signature=signature.map(function(chr){return (chr+256).toString(16).slice(-2)}).join('');
Logger.log(signature);

The above leads to error ""Cannot convert Array to (class)[]."". Which seems to indicate that the computeHmacSha256Signature function is more comfortable with the string input.
I got yet another invalid kRegion output signature by using the output signature of kDate without converting it to a string:
var input=""20120215"";
var key=""AWS4""+""wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"";
var signature=Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(input,key);
input=""us-east-1"";
key=signature;
signature = Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(input,key);
signature=signature.map(function(chr){return (chr+256).toString(16).slice(-2)}).join('');
Logger.log(signature);//non-valid c3b37a4dc2e085fcd35411493526592a33ef1d7d38454a25e574a34fe190d7be

I tried many other conversions with no success.

You want to achieve the result of the sample scripts of ""Examples of How to Derive a Signing Key for Signature Version 4"" using Google Apps Script.

In your case, you want to retrieve the value of f4780e2d9f65fa895f9c67b32ce1baf0b0d8a43505a000a1a9e090d414db404d from the following sample values as kSigning.
key = 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY'
dateStamp = '20120215'
regionName = 'us-east-1'
serviceName = 'iam'



If my understanding is correct, how about this sample script?
Important points:

At Google Apps Script, the data which was encrypted by Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature() is the bytes array of the signed hexadecimal. In the sample scripts, the bytes array is converted to the unsigned hexadecimal. So it is required to be converted.


But, when the byte array is created by Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(), the created byte array can be used for Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature() without converting.


From above situation, the sample script for Google Apps Script can be made as follows.
Sample script:
In this sample script, in order to check whether the script is correct, I tested the script using the sample values at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-v4-examples.html.
function myFunction() {
  // These are the sample values of https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-v4-examples.html
  var key = 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY';
  var dateStamp = '20120215';
  var regionName = 'us-east-1';
  var serviceName = 'iam';

  // I prepared the following script.
  var kDate = Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(dateStamp, ""AWS4"" + key);
  var kRegion = Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(Utilities.newBlob(regionName).getBytes(), kDate);
  var kService = Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(Utilities.newBlob(serviceName).getBytes(), kRegion);
  var kSigning = Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(Utilities.newBlob(""aws4_request"").getBytes(), kService);
  kSigning = kSigning.map(function(e) {return (""0"" + (e < 0 ? e + 256 : e).toString(16)).slice(-2)}).join("""");

  Logger.log(kSigning) // Result
}


About above script, for example, kDate is the byte array. So regionName is required to be converted to the byte array. Please be careful this.

Result:
f4780e2d9f65fa895f9c67b32ce1baf0b0d8a43505a000a1a9e090d414db404d

This value is the same with the sample value. By this, it was found that the prepared script returns the correct value.

What I Want to Do
I have a large list of sha256 hashes that correspond to email addresses. I have no way of knowing the original email addresses. The sha256 hashes were generated from SQL server and appear to be in varbinary. An example is: 0x3EFE04CD91AE58D9AE6019A330DDE09928C1586AC0F998B379AAF46772AAE326. 
What I need to do is generate SHA256 hashes of another list of email addresses which I do have and then compare the newly generated hashes with the original list to find the matches.
My problem
I do not have SQL server, and I have not been able to find a way to generate the varbinary type of hash. All of the solutions that I find using R, online hash generators, and mysql generate the hash using characters such as 5e524c1ccbb13fe78f4a370fa67b14b338e0034dd341f257a5ad33a992f5e5fb. 
It is entirely possible that it's just my ignorance here, and I would appreciate any reading to help me learn more about this. Ideally, my solution would be done using R, and I already have the code prepared to do it. Of course, none of the generated hashes match given the above problem. 
My questions is: How can I convert the varbinary sha256 hash to a character using either mysql, R, or JavaScript? I prefer R or mysql for this if possible. 
I appreciate any insights in advance!

When I have checked with client which they are using Python script and they always get positive integers (I need to develop in Java using bouncy castle).  Surprising is, whatever positive numbers I have, they match exactly on their side at respective index (output from Python script).

"55028350","Hash value from C function","I have a problem and hope you can help me.
I have a function written in C that returns hash a value. My 
headache is when I execute the  program from another tool it takes a lot of time to run, probably because inside my function I run a command that hashes my value in SHA256, so I would like to know if there is another way to do it, maybe a function or something like that.
Here is what I have:
const char *EncryptSHA256 (char *Arg1) {  
    char command[128];
    char result[512];

    //I want to replace from here
    snprintf(command, sizeof command, ""echo -n %s | sha256sum | cut -c1-64"",Arg1);  

    FILE *fpipe;

    if (0 == (fpipe = (FILE*)popen(command, ""r""))) {
        perror(""popen() failed."");
        exit(1);
    }

    fread(result, 1, 512, fpipe);

    pclose(fpipe);
    const char *sha256 = &result[0];
    //to here

    return sha256;
}  

","Your code has undefined behavior because you return a pointer to result, a local array with automatic storage. Reading from this array by the caller has undefined behavior.
You should at least make result static so its contents remain readable after EncryptSHA256 returns to its caller.
Regarding the inefficiency of the method, here is a public domain implementation of SHA256 that you can use directly inside your program:

You would change your function to this:
const char *EncryptSHA256(char *Arg1) {  
    struct sha256 s;
    unsigned char md[32];
    static char result[65];

    sha256_init(&s);
    sha256_update(&s, Arg1, strlen(Arg1));
    sha256_sum(&s, md);
    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        sprintf(result + i * 2, ""%02x"", md[i]);
    }
    return result;
}

You could also change the API to pass an array of 32 unsigned characters to get the binary form if it is more convenient.

The file has not been changed since I sent it to them.
They know that it was me who sent the file.

I'm coding in Python, so I was thinking of pulling in the file, taking a hash of it, and then encrypting the hash with my private key. I would send the original file along with this new file (probably just a .txt) to whoever I want. My friends could then decrypt the hash using my public key and compare it to a hash they take of the original file. I'd like to use something at least on the level of SHA-256. I do not want to use MD5 or SHA-1.
Note- The original file I am sending does not have to be encrypted, just looking for some integrity and non-repudiation.
Would this fulfill the two requirements above? And is there an easy way to implement this in Python?

That's exactly what we commonly call signing or digital-signature, which fulfills your two requirements.

Would this fulfill the two requirements above?

Yes. Signing a message doesn't prevent it from being manipulated. It's only getting infeasible of generating a signature for a manipulated message without the private key.

And is there an easy way to implement this in Python?

Sure, pyCrypto supports RSA and DSA. You should try ed25519, though, because its signatures are smaller.

Is it possible to avoid this copy ? 
","You can avoid the copy if you abandon using the sha256.Sum256() function, and you first create a hash.Hash by calling sha256.New().
Using a hash.Hash you can calculate the digest using the Hash.Sum() method, and what's important here is that you can pass a slice to it indicating that you want the results to be appended to that.
For the target slice, you can pass a slice value pointing to the element in your x array where you want the result, e.g. with 0 length (as result will be appended to this slice, not filled into it):
var x [sha256.BlockSize+sha256.Size]byte
h := sha256.New()
h.Write(data)
h.Sum(x[sha256.BlockSize:sha256.BlockSize])

See this example to demonstrate it:
data := []byte(""hello"")
fmt.Println(sha256.Sum256(data))

var x [sha256.BlockSize + sha256.Size]byte
h := sha256.New()
h.Write(data)
res := h.Sum(x[sha256.BlockSize:sha256.BlockSize])
fmt.Println(res)
fmt.Println(x)

First I print the result using sha256.Sum256() so we have an ""authentic"" result to comapre to. Then I call and print the result of Hash.Sum(). Last we print the x array to verify the result is in it.

Update:
You wrote that you knew about this but intentionally avoided this to avoid allocating a hash.Hash. Know that sha256.Sum256() uses the same implementation that is returned by sha256.New() under the hood, so this solution is most likely not slower (did not benchmark). Also you can reuse the hasher! So in fact this can be made faster. To reuse, call the Hash.Reset() method.
Update #2:
You indicated you have to do this in every web request. In this case probably using sha256.Sum256() is the best choice. If you do need to boost performance, you could opt to ""clone"" the sha256 package, and in your cloned version you could modify the Sum256() function to receive a slice where the results could be stored directly (my linked other answer shows the first step toward this), but seriously, copying 32 bytes (size of SHA-256 digest) is so fast, not worth the hassle, and performance gain would not be huge.

$hashed_password = password_hash(hash(""sha256"", trim($_POST[""password""])), PASSWORD_BCRYPT);

Then I will save the BCRYPT hashed password in the database.
And to verify the user's password I would simply do this:
$hashed_password = ""select hashed_password from users where email = 'abc@email.com'"";

if(password_verify(hash(""sha256"", trim($_POST[""password""])), $hashed_password))
{
    echo ""Welcome"";
}
else
{
    echo ""Wrong Password!"";
}

This way I will just update the user's password in the MYSQL database by looping each registered user, then I will retrieve the sha256() hashed password, and finally I will just re-save it after it has been BCRYPTed with password_hash():
$new_password = password_hash($old_sha256_hashed_password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);

$mysql->save_user_password($new_password, $user_id);

So users will still be able to login with their old password.
What do you think about this solution?
Is it still safe even if I sha256() hash the password before BCRYPT it?
","Since your current hashing system (unsalted SHA256) is indeed very unsecure, you could give immediate protection to the passwords with double hashing. As soon as possible, when the user logs in the next time, I would switch to the new algorithm and remove double hashing.
Make old hashes more secure:
$doubleHashToStoreInDb = password_hash($oldUnsaltedSha256HashFromDb, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);

Doing this for each row will protect the otherwise unsecurely stored passwords. Note the PASSWORD_DEFAULT parameter, it should be prefered over a specific algorithm, because it is future proof. And mark the double hashes, so you can distinguish between double hashes and already converted hashes, see why.
Handle new user registrations:
$hashToStoreInDb = password_hash($_POST['password'], PASSWORD_DEFAULT);

Just use the new algorithm without double hashing.
Verify logins:
if (checkIfDoubleHash($storedHash))
{
  $correctPassword = password_verify(oldPasswordHash($_POST[""password""]), $storedHash);
  if ($correctPassword)
    storeConvertedHash(password_hash($_POST['password'], PASSWORD_DEFAULT));
}
else
{
  $correctPassword = password_verify($_POST['password'], $storedHash);
}

// Hashes the user password with a deprecated hashing scheme
function oldPasswordHash($password)
{
  return hash(""sha256"", trim($password));
}

Double hashes will be converted to the new password hash function, this is possible because we have the original user password at this moment. New hashes are verified with password_verify() which is a future proof and backwards compatible function.
Adapting the password algorithm to future hardware is not a one-time task, it will be necessary as soon as new hardware will become faster. PHP offers the function password_needs_rehash() to find out whether a rehashing is necessary, then you can also calculate a new hash and store it.

Why is the = symbol not coming between sha2(username, NULL) and 'FCD8FE02F495400DC020499AC31FC75ABA05005622FD7A2F01D37153724CB395'
The actual query should turn out to be :
SELECT `user_id` FROM `users` WHERE sha2(username, NULL) = 'FCD8FE02F495400DC020499AC31FC75ABA05005622FD7A2F01D37153724CB395' AND `password` = '2668dcd9bac3c8bb60742f139876d1d6'

Any ideas what I'm doing wrong ?
","This is actually a simple query and using Codeigniter methods to build the statement is not helping in this case.
Try using a much simpler bound query like this one.
$sql = ""SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE sha2(username, 256) = ? AND `password` = ?"";
$query = $this->db->query($sql, array($data[""username""], $data[""password""]));
return $query->row_array();

Note I put in the second parameter to the mysql sha2() call. I think both params are required and if either is missing or null then sha2() returns null.

"58095139","Is it safe to store sha256 hash of the original unencripted file that is to be stored in encrypted form?","I am working on a document management system and in order to detect changes in files/duplicates of files I am using sha256 to get the digests for comparison. This is being done in python. The system can be configured to encrypt the files before storage.
The question is whether it is still safe to store the digest for the unencrypted file.
This digest is used as an identifier for the stored files and is also used to detect if the file being added to the system already exists. I am okay with the chance of collision of sha256 algorithm for this purpose. I have also read that the digest produced by sha256 cannot be used to recreate the original data.
Assuming the file cannot be reconstructed from the hash and the fact that the file is stored in encrypted form, it should be safe to keep the original hash for comparisons/searching right... or should I rethink my strategy? these comparisons are going to be internal to the application and will not be exposed to the user in anyway.
","Preimage resistence of SHA-256 is 2^256, and collision resistance is 2^128 (brief summary). On the other hand, you can simply check the number of combinations needed to guess the key to decrypt the file. SHA-256 preimage attack complexity is comparable to cracking 256-bit key for symmetric encryption. So, in general, I'd say, this approach is secure enough, because it's easier to restore the original file by guessing the key rather than finding preimage from SHA-256. 
Would be good to know which algorithm and parameters you're going to use for file encryption, maybe in your case the answer would be different.

","First of all, Git and GitHub are very different things. Your question isn't clear about which it refers to. I'm pretty sure you either mean the GitHub Desktop installer or the Git for Windows installer.
The official Git for Windows project does publish SHA-256 hashes for its releases.
GitHub doesn't publish hashes of its installers but it does sign them, which is even better. Right-click the installer, go to Properties, then to Digital Signatures.

Step through in a debugger until you get to that line and you will find that line contains the checksum and checksum2 is empty.
Change it to

Because there are few libraries for cryptography in VBScript, I'm using server side Javascript and the crypto-js library from https://code.google.com/archive/p/crypto-js/
I've tried to translate the PHP code example from Facebook's docs at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/gamesonfacebook/login#parsingsr into Javascript. I can generate an HMAC SHA256 hash of the signed_request payload but that doesn't match the signed_request signature.
I think the problem is that Facebook's signature is in a different format. It looks to be binary (~1抚Ö.....) while the HMAC SHA256 hash I'm generating is a hexadecimal string (7f7e8f5f.....). In Facebook's PHP example the hash_hmac function uses the raw binary parameter. So I think I need to either convert Facebook's signature to hexadecimal or my signature to binary in order to do an ""apples-to-apples"" comparison and get a match.
Here's my code:
/* Use the libraries from https://code.google.com/archive/p/crypto-js/

expectedSig = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(encodedPayload, FB_APP_SECRET); // Unaltered payload string; no match
expectedSig = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(payload, FB_APP_SECRET); // base64-decoded payload string; no match

The solution was to use .toString() on the signatures. It seems like crypto-js uses a word format that was preventing a comparison match. I did also switch to using the base64 decoding provided by crypto-js in order to stick with one library.

Is it still possible to send plain text password even after encryption?

[Rather than ‘encryption’, which could be reversible, you mean ‘hashing’, assuming the use of the term “SHA-256” was correct. SHA-256 is a one-way hash, the whole point of which is it's not directly recoverable.]
No, but they could conceivably have sent the mail directly after you entered the password, rather than storing it and retrieving it.
In any case a plain SHA-256 salted hash, is considered an unconscionably weak way to store a password today; you would hope for a deliberately slow password-hashing algorithm such as bcrypt.

Is it safe?

No! They sent you your password over the public unprotected e-mail infrastructure! That is, if anything, a worse sin than storing plaintext passwords in the database...

How I call this function
password = ""azerty123""
secret_file_path = sys.argv[1]

the_file = open(secret_file_path, ""rb"")
encrypted = the_file.read()
decrypted = decrypt(encrypted, password)
the_file.close()

print("":: Decrypted: \n"" + bytes.decode(decrypted))

","The bytes.decrypt() function by default expects an UTF-8 encoded string. But not every sequence of bytes is a valid UTF-8 sequence. In your case cipher.decrypt() (which may return any sequence of bytes) returned a byte-sequence, which is not a valid UTF-8 sequence. Thus the bytes.decode() function raised an error.
The actual reason why cipher.decrypt() returned a non-UTF-8 string is a bug in your code: 
Your encrypted file format contains non-utf-8 data. Its format is like:

16 bytes len info (unencrypted, UTF-8 encoded)
16 bytes IV (unencrypted, binary i.e. non-UTF-8 encoded)
n bytes payload (encrypted, UTF-8 encoded)

You have to ensure that on decryption you only decode parts of your file, that are UTF-8 encoded. Furthermore you have to ensure that you decrypt only encrypted parts of your file (as mentioned in your comments)

To do this, I create an array of structures and then raster through that array to assign the pertinent information to each field. This proceeds without issue. I then attempt to raster through the array again to write each structure's fields to a file whereupon the program crashes after the first write (ie only one structure's worth of content is successfully written to the output file).

I naively assumed this was an overflow issue related to my 
snprintf(&hash_ptr[i*2], (64), ""%02x"", generated_hash[i]);

operation, but increasing the size of the hash buffer in the struct does not seem to help. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
I compiled as follows: gcc -o diagnostic -g diagnostic.c -lcrypto -lm
","char hash[65];

Okay, hash has room for 65 characters.
char* hash_ptr = &user_password_structs->hash[0];

So, hash_ptr points to hash, so it points to room for 65 characters.
for (i=0; i < (64); i++) {
    snprintf(&hash_ptr[i*2], (64), ""%02x"", generated_hash[i]); // Need to convert from hex to char representation
}

When i is 60, i*2 is 120. So you're trying to write to the 120th position of a buffer with room for 65 characters.
Change that (64) to 32 in the loop or change hash[65] to a bigger buffer.
Using valgrind found this immediately. You should learn to use some too that detects buffer overflows, use after free, double frees, and similar problems.

I noticed that Intel provides native extensions (https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-sha-extensions) for creating SHA256 hashes. Is there any existing library in Java that can hook these native extensions? Is there a JVM implementation that natively hooks these extensions?
Is there a different implementation I should choose for millions of small String and Number values over a single giant file?

although I have the commons-codec-1.8.jar in the wwwroot\WEB-INF\lib folder, which should contain a version of DigestUtils including sha256Hex() 
Thanks a lot!
Edit:
I solved the problem for the long return of chars. It was a horrible mistake. In the original Code of Ben Nadel was this line of code for (var byte in digest){... which does not work in Coldfusion 9. So I changed it to this: for (i = 1 ; i <= arrayLen( bytes ) ; i++){... instead of this: for (i = 1 ; i <= arrayLen( digest ) ; i++){... and var tail = bitAnd( 255, bytes[i] ); to var tail = bitAnd( 255, digest[i] );

sha256 which is being returned null.

","Preferred way to create SHA256 (use SHA256 to pick implementation):
SHA256 sha256 = SHA256.Create();

Parameter of Create is name of algorithm - you don't really need to pass one unless you use base class to pick which one to use. To fix you code remove or use correct parameter: 
SHA256 sha256 = SHA256Managed.Create(); 

or 
SHA256 sha256 = SHA256Managed.Create(""SHA256"");

Note that both calls actually are implemented by base SHA256 class and first just pick ""default"" implementation. 
See SHA256.Create for reference.

First, The CreateToken method is passed the credentials to create the payload. It then calls the EncodeToken method that takes the payload and secret as a parameter. Keep in mind that my secret is a hard-coded string that never changes throughout the lifetime of the app; So I know that is not randomly generating the number 1. 
Line 39, The header and payload are converted into a base 64 string and joined together by a dot which generates the first two parts of my token perfectly:  
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhcHBrZXkiOiIxMjMtNDU2LTc4OS0wIiwicmVzb3VyY2UiOiJnZXRfZ2VvY29kZSJ9

Then, I call the Sign method on line 41 which request the signing of my token using the SHA256 algorithm. 
The Sign method accepts the combined header and payload as str then the secret is passed through as key. 
On line 62, I begin the creation of the signature using my custom key, which is ""testsecret"". 
Then I URL encode the signature on line 67, just before returning it. When I return it, line 41 combines the three parts of the token together, thus leaving me with a perfect JWT...... except for the number ""1"" at the far right end of the secret. 
please help. 
","It's to do with the way that HttpServerUtility.UrlTokenEncode works, emphasis mine:

Encodes a byte array into its equivalent string representation using base 64 digits, which is usable for transmission on the URL

You'll know that depending on its length a Base64 string will be padded with = appended to the end.  The = is not considered URL safe and so is replaced with an integer denoting the count, in this case 1.
You can test this by debugging and replace the line below...
return System.Web.HttpServerUtility.UrlTokenEncode(signature);

...with this...
return Convert.ToBase64String(signature);

...and inspecting the return value. 
You'll see that it ends with a = so HttpServerUtility.UrlTokenEncode replaces it with a 1.

"56620198","How do I pad bits to a string in C?","I am implementing the sha256 algorithm in C. I don't need help with the algorithm. One of the tasks while implementing the algorithm is to pad bits to a message such that the message is either 512 bits long or its length is a multiple of 512 bits.
I initially thought that padding bits to a message would simply mean padding zeroes to it. But since the message is a character message(a string), I don't think my logic is correct.
I don't have a problem in the code. I just don't know how to pad bits to the string(msg in the code)
    #include<stdio.h>
    #include<stdlib.h>
    int main(int argc,char *argv[])
    {
       char *msg=(char*)malloc(sizeof(char)*512);
       printf(""\n Enter a message"");
       scanf(""%s"",msg);
       //I don't know how to pad bits to msg
       return 0;
    }

","
I initially thought that padding bits to a message would simply mean padding zeroes to it.

There are algorithms that expect a constant size of the block, ex. AES or sha256. They are called, literally, ""block algorithms"", ex. block ciphers. When dealing with messages shorter then the size of the block you have to fill the unused bits with something. 
Usually, by convention, for simplicity, they are filled with zero. There are standards that say with what you may pad the unused bits/bytes. Sometimes they are filled with random bytes or as with a single 1 and then zeros 0000...00 bits, etc. See ex. this wiki page
The client has to know the length of the message. In case of C strings, I would just pad it with zero bytes. C strings end with a zero byte anyway, so the user can just strlen(received_message) and he will know the length of the string.
In case of dealing with arbitrary data, you have to pass the length of the message in some way. Maybe some other way or with the message, at the beginning of it, for example. So, for example, you can choose the first 4 bytes to represent the message length. Or you can specify that the message starts with a C string with the message length encoded using a number represented in base 16 using ASCII characters (so you can read the message length with %x) and after the string your message continues.

How do I pad bits to a string in C?

Just initialize the msg memory with zeros, either with calloc or meset:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
int main(int argc,char *argv[]) {
   char *msg = calloc(128, sizeof(*msg));
   if (msg == NULL) abort();
   printf(""\n Enter a message"");
   if (scanf(""%127s"", msg) != 1) abort()
   # bits are padded with zeros, proceed with your algorithm
   return 0;
}

or you can memset only the unused bytes in the memory:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc,char *argv[]) {
   char *msg = malloc(128 * sizeof(*msg));
   if (msg == NULL) abort();
   printf(""\n Enter a message"");
   if (scanf(""%127s"", msg) != 1) abort();
   memset(&msg[strlen(msg)], 0, 128 - strlen(msg));
   # bits are padded with zeros, proceed with your algorithm
   return 0;
}

Notes to your code:

Don't cast result of malloc
Don't use scanf, it is unsafe. Especially never use %s with scanf.

","The C# code:

converts the hash to its hexadecimal representation hashStr. To convert a byte array to a hexadecimal string in Java see this post.
removes ""-"" that were introduced by BitConverter. You won't need to do this in Java, since adding ""-"" is specific to BitConverter.
concatenates hashStr and str with a dot in between to get a token. This is trivial in Java: token = hashStr + ""."" + str.
converts the token to a base64 encoding. To do this in Java, use Base64.encodeBase64String as was done in your example

The code you're referring to does not perform these steps. Did you consider adding these steps to the Java code?

If I just have it sitting in a file, someone could read the source PHP to find that file, read the file, and then send a fake POST with that hashed password. If I have it salted, they just need to read the source code and then remove the salt. Can they see the PHP source?
Hopefully that makes sense. I just need to know how to store hashed/salted passwords on my web server. Can I just put them in a .txt?? What happens if someone reads that .txt, can't they just send a fake POST and the server will accept it??
Thanks in advance!
","
Don't put them in a .txt file. At least not one in a web-accessible directory. I would advise storing them in a database.
If someone does gain access to your password hashes, they can't use it to login, at least not directly, because you would be re-hashing the hash when verifying the password, thus producing a different, non-matching hash. However, having access to the password hash does make it a lot easier to crack the actual password via dictionary or brute-force, since checking to see if the password is a match can be done locally and does not require making a request to your server. For this reason, be sure to keep the hashes reasonably safe, and if they do get leaked, force password resets on your users.

Incidentally, you don't have to worry about users being able to view your PHP source code, unless they are able to find an exploit in your code that will disclose the source code.

","You are sending hex encoded data from the server. Then your client should not convert that hex again with DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(num)
Instead of the client doing

   String num1 = DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(num);

The other pieces of the hub is possible (MQTT, TLS, URL encoding, EPOCH etc) but the HMAC SHA256 is a struggle.

","When you do echo a it prints the letter and a newline. So the string you use in the C program should be ""a\n"".
Also, you do the checksum of all of the array, not only the two letters used in the command line example. Use the proper length instead.

"58635099","Why does SHA256 hash not match after uploading and downloading file?","I'm creating a feature for an app to store a file on a webserver while maintaining data about the file on SQL Server. I generate a SHA256 hash and store it as BINARY(32) and then upload the file to a WebDav server using HTTPClient. Later when I want to view the file in the app, I do a GET request, download the file, and check the SHA256 hash with the stored hash. It doesn't match :( Why?
I've tried checking the hash on the server and the local machine and it doesn't match either. I've done a ton of research and made sure I wasn't hashing the filename (you can see the code below).
public static byte[] GetSHA256(string path) {
    using (var stream = File.OpenRead(path)) {
        using (var sha256 = SHA256.Create()) {
            return sha256.ComputeHash(stream);
        }
   }
}

To Upload a file:
public async Task<bool> Upload(string path, string name) {
    var storedHash = GetSHA256(path/name);
    //Store this hash in a database, omitted for brevity
    using (var file = File.OpenRead(path)) {
        var content = new MultipartFormDataContent();
        content.Headers.ContentType.Media = ""multipart/form-data"";
        content.Add(new StreamContent(file));
        var result = await HttpClient.PutAsync(uri, content);
  }
}

To download:
var result = await HttpClient.GetAsync(uri);
using (var stream = await result.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync()) {
    var fileInfo = new FileInfo(""TestFile"");
    using(var fileStream = fileInfo.Open(FileMode.CreateNew, FileAccess.ReadWrite, FileShare.Delete)) {
        await stream.CopyToAsync(fileStream);
    }
}
var downloadedFileHash = GetSHA256(""TestFile"");

//check if downloadedFileHash matches the storedHash by comparing byte[] length and content with for loop.

I expect that the hash would match. I know I'm missing a few using statements and other code but I omitted a bunch for brevity.
EDIT: The hashes for the downloaded files stay the same so the problem isn't downloading but uploading. I uploaded the same files multiple times but get back different hashes for each one. But the different hashes stay constant.
","Sorry y'all, you can delete this question because I found the problem/answer but am still confused why this is occurring.
Turns out webdav was adding extra headers to my file for some reason, see: Header info being written into file when PUT-ing to a Webdav server
Strangest thing. So I encountered this post. https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/robert_mcmurray/2011/10/18/sending-webdav-requests-in-net-revisited/
Rewrote my code to be
public static async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Upload(string path, string name, FileStream file) {
    var method = new HttpMethod(@""PUT"");
    var message = new HttpRequestMessage(method, path/name) {
        Content = new StreamContent(file)
    };

    return await HttpClient.SendAsync(message);
}

And it works... But I'm wonder how the two methods of uploading differ.

1. Concatenate the API key with the current timestamp in the format below:
<<APIKEY>>_<<timestamp(yyyy'-'MM'-'ddTHH:mm:ss.fffZ)>>

and this step is easy:
hash('sha256', $data);

result is:

and this is correct result
The next step is:
2. The combination of the created signature along with the provided API secret key will act as the
digital signature of the call.

I have API secret key like:

How I can get Digital signature with a combination of created signature and provided API secret key?
There is an Python example like:

print ""message"", key

sha_hash = hashlib.sha256(key).hexdigest()

print ""sha256 hash:"", sha_hash


rsa_key = RSA.importKey(pub_key)
cipher = PKCS1_v1_5.new(rsa_key)
signature = base64.encodestring(cipher.encrypt(sha_hash))

but how I can get signature using PHP?
","While there are numerous ways to accomplish this, I recommend leveraging the openssl_public_encrypt method. There are other crypt functions and even pure PHP implementations of RSA but they are likely not as current and well maintained as openSSL is going to be on a linux system. Don't forget all the disruption in SSL/TLS these last years. Everything from retiring older protocols and weaker cyphers to POODLE type exploits.
If for whatever reason that is not an option I would probably look into phpseclib. https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib
Really might come down to what makes the most sense for your project... OS, portability, speed, etc.
Here is that Python snippet converted to equivalent PHP code.
<?php
$key = $api_key . '_' . $timestamp;

echo ""message:"" . $key;

$sha_hash = hash('sha256', $key);

echo ""sha256 hash:"" .  $sha_hash;

$rsa_key = ""your public key goes in here""; //see https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-pkey-get-public.php

","Hmac is more secure.
What you are proposing is called ""Suffix-MAC"" in Crypto101 page 135.  The problem with Suffix-MAC is a collision in the hash function can be used to create existential forgeries.  That is, if h(m1) = h(m2), and if I know suffix-mac(m1), then I also know suffix-mac(m2).
Bellare proved that HMAC is more robust because you don't need collision resistance of the hash function for it to be secure.  This is why HMAC-SHA1 is still considered okay even though SHA1 is not considered okay.

It only works by virtue that they've also hashed all the email addresses of their uses to make the hits.
Presumably, the only good this does is that Facebook doesn't know the email addresses of your customers that aren't already Facebook users. 
Am I missing anything else?
","That's not to protect the email addresses from facebook, but to protect them the rest of the way. If there's a data leak somewhere in the process, chances are that only the hashed addresses will get leaked, making them much harder to misuse.

Other hash functions from the same package (SHA1, MD5) seem to work fine.
I've also tried running from xMaxima as well as the sha1.lisp file from version 5.37.2 with the very same result.
Somehow I suspect this to be related with maxima to run under Windows.
Did anybody see such issues?
Thanks a lot.
","This was a bug in Maxima. As described by one of developers:

The correct result was only computed when Maxima was compiled with gcl

Since then it was fixed. I've tested and can confirm that sha256sum() now gives correct hashes.
One can download the fixed sha1.lisp file here.

"42000143","What is the security flaw in this authentification process over unsecure HTTP?","First question here :)
I've been reading many questions about how to secure login on sites without https. They are all very interesting and most answers boil down to ""Use SSL if you care about security!"". I agree with this, yet I also wonder, what is the flaw in this particular procedure (one user(=me), no sessions: the password is always sent with the complete content of the <html> tag, which replaces the current contents of that file.):

Server sends two variables to page: random token A and B=derivedfrom(A). 
client sends back md5(password+timestamp+B) and A.
Server derives B from A to perform the same md5hash as client and matches hashes of server and client.  
Server allows no more than 1 request per second per IP address. 

Assuming the attacker knows all valid pairs of A and B, is there any way for him/her to authenticate succesfully apart from replay attacks (during a 100ms timeframe that the hash is valid) and pure luck that he guesses the right hash for this particular timeframe? 
Of course, the attacker could still try all possible passwords, but that doesn't change by using https.
I'm not suggesting this is a useful strategy for sites that cannot use https, just wondering if there is a theoretical flaw that I didn't think of.
How would you force your way in if the site has no traffic at the moment?
","There are several flaws here:

You should not use md5. Please use some other hashing algorithm (e.g. sha256)
In order to do what you are saying, the server needs to store the passwords in plaintext. This is a very bad practise, as if you get hacked, all the passwords will be compromised. Instead, you should store a salted hash of the password. More info here: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet
This method is infeasible, as the timestamp cannot be possibly known by the server, except if the clock of the client and the server are synchronised to the millisecond (don't assume that they will be). Even if the clocks are completely synced, this will still not work. The time from when the client takes the timestamp until the packet reaches the server is variable, and the server would need to know exactly that time. Without the correct timestamp, the server won't be able to calculate the hash. Removing the timestamp will lead to replay attacks.
An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack can alter the HTML (or whatever) code on the fly and remove the hashing function (assuming it's performed in JavaScript). The browser will then transmit the password in clear. Of course the authentication will fail, but the attacker will have the password.
Probably other flaws also exist, but these are enough for the method to be inefficient I believe.

Bottom line: Do not use HTTP for user authentication. I have not heard of any cases of secure authentication over HTTP. If SSL is very expensive, you can use it only for the login page. It is still a very bad practise, as an attacker can perform session hijacking by stealing session cookies (and other man-in-the-middle attacks), but at least the password will not be revealed this way.

","What you describe is a minor technical detail in a larger procedure, which you do not go into detail at all. I'm assuming that the larger purpose of that procedure is to log in? Then what happens after this token is exchanged? Does the user receive some sort of permanent token like a cookie? Then this is susceptible to:

man in the middle attacks reading all communication
local network packet sniffing, famously publicised by the Firesheep attack

Even if (that's a large if) this particular token scheme were flawless, the entire communication chain is observable by third parties and all private data (including identifying cookies) can be read in the clear by unauthorised users in a privileged network position (→ session hijacking).

With some unit test everything is fine, but running some stress-test show us that in 30% of case, the second update is rejected because the comparaison of the checksum sent with the one generated from the data in the database is failing.
I checked and I'm almost sure there is no inner-update between the two others.
I'm wondering, is the hash algorithm related to the SHA256Managed class related to the mac adresse of the system datetime ?
It may cause the issue because we are load-balanced.

","HAProxy doesn't do HMAC natively, but it can be done using  HAProxy's Lua integration.
One approach would be to find a Lua library that can do the flavor of HMAC that you need, and then write an HAProxy converter in Lua to take the appropriate inputs and do the calculation of the digest for comparison.
I implemented something similar, once, using HAProxy 1.6 with Lua 5.x where the client sent a URL signed using HMAC-SHA1, and the proxy successfully checked it for validity.
Unfortunately, I no longer have access to that code, but I wrote this HAProxy converter to do utf-8-aware URL-escaping (percent encoding) in Lua... I mention it here because it's a complete, working example of one way to extend HAProxy functionality using Lua, including the Lua code and HAProxy configuration needed to use it, so it might help you work toward a solution.

Here is what I have in Java so far, but it's definitely not matching the value returned from C#:
private static String getCheckSum(String base64Data) throws Exception {
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");
        md.update(base64Data.getBytes(""UTF-8""));
        byte[] enc = md.digest();

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (byte b : enc) {
            sb.append(String.format(""%02x"", b));
        }

        return sb.toString().replace(""-"", """").toUpperCase();
    }

I've tried not having the charset in the getBytes() method, I've tried with the charset US-ASCII.
This stuff is not in my wheelhouse and I'm not sure how to proceed.  Any help is appreciated.
","In Java to decode Base64 String you have this (since Java8) : 
byte[] decodedBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode(encodedString);
String decodedString = new String(decodedBytes);

These examples were tested in nodejs by using the sha256 hashing algorithm package.
arr1 = [{a: 1}];
sha(arr1);
'6e340b9cffb37a989ca544e6bb780a2c78901d3fb33738768511a30617afa01d'

'6e340b9cffb37a989ca544e6bb780a2c78901d3fb33738768511a30617afa01d'

As yo can see all arrays has the same hash generated value even when they has different properties.
arr4 = [{a: 1}, {b: 2}];
sha(arr4);
'96a296d224f285c67bee93c30f8a309157f0daa35dc5b87e410b78630a09cfc7'

This one has a different hash because it has two objects instead of only one.
So my question is about to understand what is wrong with the first three arrays if I need to get a different hash of each one.
","Your sha() method probably expects a String and will thus typecast your objects to String:


arr1 = [{a: 1}];
sha(arr1);

arr2 = [{a: 1, b:2}]
sha(arr2);

arr3 = [{a: 1111111111111}];
sha(arr3);

arr4 = [{a: 1}, {b: 2}];
sha(arr4);

function sha(v) {
  console.log(v.toString());
}



So if you want an hash from these objects, you'd have to convert these to string correctly, e.g by encoding them to JSON strings first.

I have a client side register/log-in, using Alamofire to post and then retrieve and parse JSON. Unless Alamofire has ""blackboxed"" some type of hash, I am not aware of having coded any kind of hash anywhere, yet.
When I went to look into why the test passwords (passed via SSL, HTTPS, and without any effort to encrypt, yet) were showing up on the server side looking like the result of a hash, I compared that result to a deliberate server side Sha256 hash (done on the raw, plain text password matching the original that got passed from the app). I am seeing this:
""ccc"" ---->  Sha256 hash = 64daa44ad493ff28a96effab6e77f1732a3d97d83241581b37dbd70a7a4900fe
""ccc"" ----> ""simple iOS post"" (via Alamofire) = 9df62e693988eb4e1e1444ece0578579

As you can see, the values are very different, and this means unless I know what happened on the way over, I cannot authenticate anyone on the server side, nor can I use any server side password reset functions, because I have no idea what kind of hash was used.
Can anyone help me know what happened to hash the password?
Here's the simple Alamofire-based code doing the post (Xcode 9, Swift 4):

Update in response to your comment
The first thing to notice is that in R sha256 with a non-NULL key argument will calculate the hash-based message authentication code (HMAC). From ?sha256:

All hash functions either calculate a hash-digest for ‘key ==
       NULL’ or HMAC (hashed message authentication code) when ‘key’ is
       not ‘NULL’.

So if you want to use a key you will need to compare the resulting HMAC in R with the SHA2556-based HMAC in Python.
In R:
library(openssl)
sha256(""test@gmail.com"", key = ""111"")

"44372799","file within directory contains entire directory's current sha-256","I want to create a file in my directory, where the file contains the sha256 sum of that directory, including that file, and AFTER the file is created. The difficulty here being that the sha256 of the directory will be affected by updating the file with said sha256. Is this possible?
I can see how this is almost asking the computer to predict the future, but I wonder if there is some recursive algorithm to do this. For example if there is some consistent relation between the checksum of and object, and the checksum of that object with one byte changed.
This is a question of curiosity that came out of this problem: I'm trying to recreate the output of git describe --tags for a repository missing the .git directory (presumably saving this data in the repository).
","This is not possible. There might not even be a solution. To take a simple example: imagine that the value of a SHA256 hash was only 1 bit, instead of 256 bits. Suppose that, if we put the hash 0 into the file, the entire directory hashes to a value of 1; and if we put 1 into the file, the entire directory hashes to a value of 0. Then there is no solution. The same thing can happen with the full 256-bits hash. I'm not sure of the likelyhood though.
If there is a solution, you can eventually find it with an exhaustive search of all possible checksums. By the very nature of secure hashes, it won't get significantly faster than that. But this will probably run until the Sun becomes a red giant and swallows the Earth.
To improve your actual situation (beware the XY problem), you can try instructing your build system to stick the result of git rev-parse HEAD somewhere in a source file before building, or have your program execute this at runtime.

edeaaff3f1774ad2888673770c6d64097e391bc362d7d6fb34982ddf0efd18cb

Why is there a difference in the outputs?
Where am I doing wrong?

","SHA-256 is a cryptographic (one-way) hash function, so there is no direct way to decode it.
 The entire purpose of a cryptographic hash function is that you can't undo it.
One thing you can do is a brute-force strategy, where you guess what was hashed, then hash it with the same function and see if it matches. Unless the hashed data is very easy to guess, it could take a long time though.

It should be noted


Sha256 does not encrypt the data/content of your string, it instead generates a fixed size hash, using your input string as a seed.

This being the case - I could feed in the content of an encyclopedia, which would be easilly 100 mb in size of text, but the resulting string would still be 256 bits in size.

DATA MISMATCH: Found E4 instead of 65 at index 0!
ERROR: data is modified
","I thought this problem was somewhat interesting so I went through the trouble to recreate the scenario. Maybe this is not even right. But a simple case of what I thought the problem is:
void main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    //the original hash
    unsigned char newHash[] = {0xE4, 0x5F, 0x60, 0x72, 0x61, 0x7C, 0xCE, 0x5E, 0x06, 0xA9, 0x5B, 0xE4, 0x81, 0xC4, 0x33, 0x51, 
        0x02, 0x3D, 0x99, 0x23, 0x35, 0x99, 0xEA, 0xC9, 0xFD, 0xAF, 0xFC, 0x95, 0x81, 0x42, 0x62, 0x9A};
    //what I think is recieved from the socket
    unsigned char* receivedTag = ""e45f6072617cce5e06a95be481c43351023d99233599eac9fdaffc958142629a"";

    for (int i=0; i!=32; i++)
    {
            if (receivedTag[i]!=newHash[i])
            {
                    printf(""DATA MISMATCH: Found %02X instead of %02X at index %d!\n"", newHash[i], receivedTag[i], i);
                    break;
            }
    }
    return;
}

and the output was
DATA MISMATCH: Found E4 instead of 65 at index 0!

So, I thought the solution would be to just convert the Hex array to string just like it was received from the socket.
Maybe this is not the most elegant of ways to do things. But a solution None the less.
char* hexStringToCharString(unsigned char hash[], int length);
void main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    //the original hash
    unsigned char newHash[] = {0xE4, 0x5F, 0x60, 0x72, 0x61, 0x7C, 0xCE, 0x5E, 0x06, 0xA9, 0x5B, 0xE4, 0x81, 0xC4, 0x33, 0x51, 
        0x02, 0x3D, 0x99, 0x23, 0x35, 0x99, 0xEA, 0xC9, 0xFD, 0xAF, 0xFC, 0x95, 0x81, 0x42, 0x62, 0x9A};
    //what I think is recieved from the socket
    unsigned char* receivedTag = ""e45f6072617cce5e06a95be481c43351023d99233599eac9fdaffc958142629a"";

    char *newString = hexStringToCharString(newHash, 32);

    for (int i=0; i!=strlen(newString); i++)
    {
            if (receivedTag[i]!=newString[i])
            {
                    printf(""DATA MISMATCH: Found %02X instead of %02X at index %d!\n"", newHash[i], receivedTag[i], i);
                    break;
            }
    }
    free(newString);

    printf(""Yay\n"");
    return;
}

char* hexStringToCharString(unsigned char hash[], int length){

    char temp[3];
    //need length*2 characters which is 64 plus one for null!
    char *theString = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char)*((length*2)+1));
    strcpy(theString, """");
    for(int i=0;i<length;i++){
        sprintf(temp, ""%02x"", hash[i]);
        strcat(theString, temp);
    }
    return theString;

}

The output in this case
Yay

","I fixed this awhile back and wanted to update the post in case anyone else runs into this. 
So all I did was take the c.execute() functions out of the sha256_crpt IF statement, and put them at the beginning of the function for the page that login redirects to. Every user visits the first page so the user session will always have these values.
As such:
@app.route('/ask/', methods=['GET','POST'])
def ask():
    #clients come here first
    error = ''
    try:
        c, conn = connection()
        #grab all the clients info
        email = session['email']
        c.execute(""SELECT cid FROM clients WHERE email = (%s)"", (thwart(email),))
        clientcid = c.fetchone()[0]
        c.execute(""SELECT phone FROM clients WHERE email = (%s)"", (thwart(email),))
        phone = c.fetchone()[0]
        c.execute(""SELECT rating FROM clients WHERE email = (%s)"", (thwart(email),))
        rating = c.fetchone()[0]
        c.execute(""SELECT first_name FROM cpersonals WHERE cid = (%s)"", (clientcid,))
        first_name = c.fetchone()[0]
        c.execute(""SELECT last_name FROM cpersonals WHERE cid = (%s)"", (clientcid,))
        last_name = c.fetchone()[0]
        c.execute(""SELECT address FROM cpersonals WHERE cid = (%s)"", (clientcid,))
        address = c.fetchone()[0]
        c.execute(""SELECT city FROM cpersonals WHERE cid = (%s)"", (clientcid,))
        city = c.fetchone()[0]
        c.execute(""SELECT state FROM cpersonals WHERE cid = (%s)"", (clientcid,))
        state = c.fetchone()[0]
        c.execute(""SELECT zip FROM cpersonals WHERE cid = (%s)"", (clientcid,))
        czip = c.fetchone()[0]
        c.execute(""SELECT reg_date FROM cpersonals WHERE cid = (%s)"", (clientcid,))
        reg_date = c.fetchone()[0]
        conn.commit()

This is just for an easy TargetHash, for more difficult ones, the difference is even greater. I am pretty sure here openssl sha256 implementation isn't a bottleneck and something else is, but being new to C++ I am not sure what. I was earlier using to_string(nonce) and s1.compare(s2), which I replaced with fmt::format and strcmp because they're faster, but still could only gain a few seconds. Any ideas will be really appreciated.
","The bottleneck for your c++ code is your custom bytes_to_string function. Calling stringstream functions in a loop simply hits the performance.
You might want to look at this answer to another question.

replace the stringstream functions with the following code snippet. It is faster because it manipulates the string memory directly.
static const char characters[] = ""0123456789ABCDEF"";
std::string result (SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH * 2, ' ');
for(int i = 0; i < SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH; i++)
{
    result[2*i] = characters[(unsigned int) hash[i] >> 4];
    result[2*i+1] = characters[(unsigned int) hash[i] & 0x0F];
}
return result;

Thanks
","There is nothing preventing you from creating a cryptocurrency that has a fixed difficulty, however it'd not be very useful.
The difficulty in Bitcoin serves the simple purpose of ensuring that the money creation process and the confirmation process follows a predictable schedule of once every 10 minutes. If we were to fix the difficulty, then the network could not react to the influx or reduction of computational resources. So when new mining hardware joins the network the expected time between blocks would reduce, while when hardware leaves, the time between blocks lengthens. This has two effects:

The introduction of new currency to the network becomes unpredictable, i.e., when people join the network currency gets created faster and faster, resulting in a hyper-inflation. Financial systems heavily rely on predictability of the money supply.
The confirmation times are unpredictable, which is bad when people start leaving the network, we'd wait longer and longer for confirmations. On the other side, people joining the network also has adverse effects, since blocks do not have time to be propagated in the network, resulting in blockchain forks, which in turn undermines the reassurance we get from a confirmation.

Realistically speaking, there is no upside of fixing a difficulty. If you're a user, you'd get the same number of blocks (not really since they'd be stale due to blockchain forks most of the time), but the coins you'd be mining are worthless because everybody else also gets a fixed amount for their investment. And on the other side the system would be hardly usable at all.

EDIT:
My question was unclear, sorry. I need to be able to calculate the hash on a message block on one computer, then send the resulting hash to a second computer and ""continue"" the hash on the second computer with a second message block. So the flow is like:
hasher2 = hashlib.sha256()

","sha256sum is supposed to be a one-way hash.  If you could readily invert it, that would be proof that it was a failure.
sha256sum was designed to be a cryptographic hash function and, as Wikipedia explains:

The ideal cryptographic hash function has four main properties:

it is quick to compute the hash value for any given message
it is infeasible to generate a message from its hash value except by trying all possible messages
a small change to a message should change the hash value so extensively that the new hash value appears uncorrelated with the old
  hash value
it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash value


So, no, there is no sensible way to invert it.

I am using node-forge to calculate an HMAC-sha256 based upon a given string and key, using this AWS doc: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-v4-examples.html
These are the exact same strings as the documentation encoded as the documentation says to UTF-8:
const hash_type = 'sha256';
const hmac = forge.hmac.create();
const key = forge.util.encodeUtf8('c4afb1cc5771d871763a393e44b703571b55cc28424d1a5e86da6ed3c154a4b9');

  'f536975d06c0309214f805bb90ccff089219ecd68b2577efef23edd43b7e1a59');
hmac.start('sha256', key);
hmac.update(string);
console.log('SIGNATURE: ' +  hmac.digest().toHex());

My function, along with every single HMAC calculator I use online give the caluclated hash as fe52b221b5173b501c9863cec59554224072ca34c1c827ec5fb8a257f97637b1
Even the AWS Code provided by them for both javascript and python derived the same values and calculates the same hash as I received. 
However, according to the documentation in their doc's, it should be:
5d672d79c15b13162d9279b0855cfba6789a8edb4c82c400e06b5924a6f2b5d7
I have tried over 10+ calculators that all return the same value I received until I found 1 online calculator, only 1, that calculates the same as amazon at https://cryptii.com/hmac
I know HMAC is a mathematical function that is absolute, the same input will give the same output, which means that the input is different or that it is transformed along the way in a way that is abstracted from me.
Any tips?

Order does not matter, just that each set of keywords need to be unique. For example:
take this existing sample record in database:
record

-- keywords: ['apple', 'pear', 'orange']
A new record with a keyword array ['apple', 'pear', 'orange'] denied
A new record with a keyword array ['apple', 'orange', 'pear'] denied
A new record with a keyword array ['apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'grape'] accepted
As a solution, it was suggested to me that i hash the sets of keywords (lexically ordered), and use that hash as the unique key for the database entry.
Great suggestion, but two problems:
How do i handle case sensitivity in this scenario?
And is it realistic to believe that collisions are close enough to impossible if i decide to use, say for example SHA-1, to hash large sets of keywords (up to 30) and use that hash as my unique key for the database entry without requiring a check for a duplicate?
We're using firebase as our backend, and google charges per document read basis, thus, having to check for duplicates before insertion is not an acceptable nor scalable solution, since a query like that would cost us a fortune if we had to check prior to every record insertion should my table include millions of records.

Your concerns are misplaced. Databases are great at using indexes to look things up -- millions of records isn't even an especially large number.
Convert the list of keywords into a canonical form (e.g, by alphabetizing the keywords), then join the words with a separator that won't appear in the keywords (like a comma) and use the result as a unique key in your database. You don't need to use a hash.

Since our data set is in the same size as the result set we can assume we have a 1 to 1 function.

This is a faulty assumption. There is no reason to believe that SHA256 is a unique mapping across 256-bit inputs; there is, in all probability, at least one (and probably many) pairs of 256-inputs which have the same SHA256 hash.

Is there a way to map all the value and create a backwared function.

No. There are 2256 ≈ 1.16×1077 possible SHA256 hashes. As a point of comparison, there are roughly 2.4×1067 atoms in our galaxy. Even if you could turn the entire Milky Way into a computer and write one hash onto each atom, you would run out of atoms long before you finished.

trying .digesthex() on the string wouldn't work since str object don't have that method. Is there any alternative ?
","For each character in the original string, use ord to obtain the numeric value of the character and then use a string format operation to express that numeric value as a string containing a pair of hex digit characters.  Accumulate those two-digit strings into a single string.
    mystring = '\xf0z\xd8[\xfc\x7f'

        hexdigits = '{:02x}'.format(number)

You can do all of that on one line by using a list comprehension to collect the pairs of hex digit strings into a list and then using the join method with an empty separator string to glue the hex digit strings together into a single string.
    mystring = '\xf0z\xd8[\xfc\x7f'
    result   = ''.join([ '{:02x}'.format(ord(ch)) for ch in mystring ])

Or instead of a list comprehension you can use map with a lambda to build the list of hex digit pairs.

"55100846","why do I get mac_bad_record error with my tls1.2 implementation","so I'm writing my own tls 1.2 implementation for learning's sake and because the server I'm connecting to use a modified version of the protocol that ask for a non random client_random anyway (TL;DR: I'm having a bad_record_mac error on finished message with my implementation and can't find where I made a mistake)
I have to precise the only cipher suite I'm concerned about is TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
so first I create my client random and the handshake begins with the server sending server_random and the RSA public key in the certificate
I generate a random pre_master_secret and encrypt it with the RSA public key (done by a native module of the language, so no mess up by me on this) and send it back in a client_key_exchange message
I then generate the master_secret from: PRF(pre_master_secret, ""master secret"", client_random+server_random) where PRF is:
class TlsMasterSecret {
    constructor(pre_master_secret, client_random, server_random) {
        this.master_secret = TlsMasterSecret.PRF(pre_master_secret, Buffer.from(""master secret"", ""ascii""), Buffer.concat([client_random, server_random]), 48);
        this.master_secret = this.master_secret.slice(0, 48);
        this.key_block = TlsMasterSecret.PRF(this.master_secret, Buffer.from(""key expansion"", ""ascii""),Buffer.concat([server_random, client_random]), 104);
        // 20 20 16 16
        this.client_write_MAC_key = this.key_block.slice(0, 20);
        this.server_write_MAC_key = this.key_block.slice(20, 40);
        this.client_write_key = this.key_block.slice(40, 56);
        this.server_write_key = this.key_block.slice(56, 72);
    }
    static PRF(secret, label, seed, neededLength) {
        return TlsMasterSecret.P_hash(secret, Buffer.concat([label, seed]), neededLength)
    }
    static P_hash(secret, seed, neededLength) {
        const A = [seed];
        let resultHash = Buffer.from("""", ""hex"");
        // HMAC_SHA256 generates 32 bytes per update
        const iterations = Math.ceil(neededLength / 32);
        // generate A
        for(let i = 1; i < iterations + 1; i++) {
            A[i] = TlsMasterSecret.HMAC_hash(secret, A[i-1]);
        }
        // calculates the hash
        for(let i = 1; i < iterations + 1; i++) {
            resultHash = Buffer.concat([resultHash, TlsMasterSecret.HMAC_hash(secret, A[i])]);
        }
        return resultHash;
    }
    static HMAC_hash(secret, seed) {
        const hmac = crypto.createHmac(""sha256"", secret);
        hmac.update(seed);
        return hmac.digest();
    }
}

then I create the Finished message from 0x1400000c followed by 12 bytes of verify_data
verify_data is generated like this: 
// I strip the record layer headers off the messages
client_hello = 0x0100002f03032668f90d7d3b3420f7712a3004247d233d90cc63fb4b23f77912b31c8c89893b000008002f0035003c003d0100

handshake_messages = client_hello + server_hello + certificate + server_hello_done + client_key_exchange

verify_data = PRF(master_secret, ""client finished"", sha256(handshake_messages))[0..12]

then I create the MAC that will go along this message:

// hmac_sha1(secret, seed)
// seq_num is a uint64 @ 0 for the first message, 0x00000000
// type = 0x16
// version = 0x0303
// length = 0x0010
// content = 0x1400000c + verify_data
MAC = hmac_sha1(client_write_MAC_key, seq_num + type + version + length + content)
plaintext = content + MAC

IV = randomBytes(16)

// aes_128_cbc(key, IV, message)
ciphertext = aes_128_cbc(client_write_key, IV, plaintext)

final = 0x16 + 0x0303 + 0x0040 + IV + ciphertext

I setup a minimal repo to reproduce. Can you see where I've gone wrong?
","Turns out I was misunderstanding the details a bit. I'll post my solution here in case it helps someone else in the same boat.
My goal is to serve a React SPA with CSP enabled. The app happens to use Material-UI, which uses JSS, which injects inline styles - which of course are blocked by default with CSP.
Because it's a static SPA for the frontend and modifying HTTP headers is out of scope of the SPA, I instead generate a nonce on the web server. The nonce gets injected into the CSP HTTP Header and also in the index.html  tag consistent with what JSS expects.
The upside is CSP is protecting the SPA, and we don't have to use unsafe-inline escape hatch. The downside, but a small one, is that index.html is dynamic now and can't be cached. But seeing as the file is already tiny (<1kb) the benefits of CSP seem worth that tradeoff.

I was able to install OpenSSL on the box. I can create the SHA256 hash of a password but I am unsure about how to set it as a user account password. I've tried putting the hashed password in /etc/passwd but that obviously doesn't work. So after research I discovered I need to put it in the /etc/shadow file. This file does not exist on this system which means the Shadow package is not installed. 
I went to install the Shadow package but I've run out of space. Is there anyway that I can use this SHA256 password without the /etc/shadow file? Recompiling the kernel is a last resort, we'd like to avoid that.
","Honestly you might have to just recompile the kernel so you can get the shadow package. From experience and all the research I'm seeing online I don't see any other way of storing the SHA256 user passwords without the /etc/shadow file path. Obviously if you're root you can $ sudo passwd user to change / set the user passwords to the hashed SHA256 passwords but the only place that I'm seeing them ever stored is the /etc/shadow file.
The only reason I say that is because the only way I know of verifying the data for the user passwords is pwck -r /etc/shadow & pwck -r /etc/passwd so without those file paths I don't see any other way of storing / verifying the user password data.
Have you tried the pwconv command to create the /etc/shadow file from the /etc/passwd file?

Is there a way to override algorithm in RSA object to an algorithm that supports this padding to make it supportive for all paddings.

UPDATE
RSACng works. In my scenario I am using containerkey to store private key in the machine using RSACryptoServiceProvider to retrieve private key when required using containerkey name. As a workaround to use RSACng I am importing properties exporting from RSACryptoServiceProvider object like shown below. Is there a better way to do this?

","RSA supports OaepSHA256 in .NET Framework since .NET Framework 4.6 and in .NET Core since 1.0 (as well as OaepSHA1, OaepSHA256, OaepSHA384, OaepSHA512 and the standard for PKCS#1, see the documentation here).
As for support in older versions of .NET Framework - I don't believe it's possible because the Cryptography API treats cryptographic algorithm implementations as opaque black-boxes without much room for extensibility (i.e. you can't really subclass an existing implementation, but you can reimplement your own easily enough). I note this is partly because the API simply wraps Windows' built-in crypto functionality which is opaque anyway (like how System.Drawing wraps GDI without much room for extension there either).
As for the ""Specified padding mode is not valid for this algorithm"" error - the issue is you're using RSACryptoServiceProvider instead of RSACng. You should prefer the Cryptographic-Next-Generation (Cng) implementations over CryptoServiceProvider implementations, see this article for more details.
If you're targeting .NET Framework 4.6 or later, or .NET Core 1.0 or later, you can use it like so:
using Sytem.Security.Cryptography;

Byte[] inputPlaintext = ...
RSAEncryptionPadding oaepsha256 = RSAEncryptionPadding.OaepSHA256;
using( RSA rsaImpl = new RSACng() )
{

As I want to ""mine bitcoin in Excel"" (only a didactic experiment , of course) I need to pass a binary string to this function, proper sequence of 0 and 1 bits, instead of ascii representation of 1 (4 bits). 
I can do that in the excel cells or It can be a VBA code, it doesn't matter to me. 
Here the excel I used:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qdy_PpUj4ZWLGBXCsSSBmQgTMhQITLVz
The SHA256 function that I am  using in the excel sheet is hashing the binary as a text rather than using the bits from it. This results in the output of this excel function being different from the desired one. Below is a simple example in python that will illustrate it.

The first output is the actual one you should get from the first round of hashing. The second output is the one that I am getting from the excel function. That is because this function is hashing that binary in the same way as hashing a string like 'hello world'.
So I need to transform the input value in this excel function from text to binary data before doing the sha round.

On my test instance, with around 12k artifacts, the re-indexing of the database after the upgrade takes around 12 hours. I'm afraid in my prod instance it will take close to a month (around 800k artifacts). 
- Has anyone seen this before? I did not find any articles that would indicate such a long time
- Is there a way to tune parameters to speed up the indexing?
- Is there a way to predict how much time my prod indexing would take? If it is based on number/size/type of artifacts?
Specifications:
Artifactory in HA mode installed on linux server. DB MSSQL 2016. Filestore - NAS shared mount between the HA nodes. Upgrading from 4.12.2 to 6.5.2.
","Firstly, as you state you have Artifactory with HA, leads me to that you have an Enterprise subscription. Please note that Enterprise subscription allows you to contact the JFrog Support-Team at support@jfrog.com. 
Now with regards to your scenario and questions, please note that JFrog mentions in their wiki page regarding SHA-2 migration, that the process is ""resource intensive operation"".
As you mentioned, the process can indeed take weeks/months for big filestores, but it can be tweaked by using the system properties mentioned on the same wiki page.
If you do decide to tweak it and add more workers for example, I highly recommend you to keep monitoring your database, as if the SHA2 migration will cause an impact on the database performance, your production can be affected. 
As for statistics, there is no way to predict the time this process can take as it depends on the workers you specified for the job, the resources the instance has, etc.. 
I hope this clarifies further.

Generated Hash
The hash query string parameter is to be followed by the generated hash for that specific request. To generate the hash:

Take the body of the HTTP POST request
Add the provided API Secret to the end of the body
Converts it to SHA256 and converts the hashed message to hexadecimal format

For example, assuming the provided API Secret is ""secretapikey"" and the HTTP POST body contains the following:
{ ""apiKey"": 123, ""invoiceId"": 1 }
The generated hash will be:
d48cf8a852713844603d7c8cbefb3e81cfb29e7540d98f06affdf58322c1038e
Below is the steps taken to produce the above generated hash:
HTTP POST Body =>   { ""apiKey"": 123, ""invoiceId"": 1 }
Secret  => secretapikey
Text to be hashed   => { ""apiKey"": 123, ""invoiceId"": 1 }secretapikey
SHA-256 Hash    => d48cf8a852713844603d7c8cbefb3e81cfb29e7540d98f06affdf58322c1038e
I have to concatinate two strings ({ ""apiKey"": 123, ""invoiceId"": 1 }secretapikey) and then hash them to send to an api end point. But the Hash generated by following code is not according to hash generated by an online sha256:-
$secretapikey = ""secretapikey"";
$postbody = array();
$postbody['apiKey'] = ""123"";
$postbody['invoiceId'] = 1;

$jpb = json_encode($postbody);

$hashed = $jpb.$secretapikey; //Here is Problem. It is not concatenated according to requirement


$result = hash('SHA256', $hashed);

d2c5d184be42ff4ae3a0046d0727c026f38c1e92f8960cb9d17d496c7b89b7b3

","hash('SHA256', $hashed); is doing its job right
and $hashed = $jpb.$secretapikey; is joining the two strings correctly.
The reason you don't get the hash you expect is that the JSON you use for the test is

I need to store a signed 32-bit integer as a string and convert it back later, the more information density / shorter the string the better. The code that I'm already using is
var num;
var str = num.toString(36);
var num2 = parseInt(str, 36);

So in a block in a block chain I am assuming the it uses the parent hash, the data and nonce as input. I think the parent hash and the data are maybe concatenated together and the nonce is used in the function somewhere else. Or maybe the nonce is the number of times the sha256 function is run to have the block solved with the previous output hash as the new input? Can someone please explain this properly to me as I have yet to find an answer yet?
","In Bitcoin, the following data is serialized (into one 80 byte value), then hashed twice using SHA256 to produce the Block Hash:

Version (4 bytes)
Previous Block Hash (32 bytes)
Merkle Root Hash (32 bytes)
Timestamp (4 bytes)
nBits (4 bytes)
nonce (4 bytes)

The merkle root is the root of a merkle tree of all the transactions in the block, the nBits describe the difficulty target that the block hash must meet in order to be considered valid, and the nonce may be changed by the miner each time the hashing function is done until a valid block hash is found.
Example
Grab a block (eg. block 3): Block 3 in json or Block 3 in hex
Concatenate (in this order, little endian, hex format) the version, previous block hash, merkle root, unix epoch time, difficulty target (bits), and nonce. You’ll see you can copy the first 160 characters from the Block 3 in hex link.

hashfile = open(""/home/pi/vercheck/sha256.txt"", ""w+"")

First one returns hash value(?) of: c8a31cb076b21999bd2cdcfa5f446a7a6644de88037087112fa18bd90cc13984

"53392432","What does this ""note: see declaration of '_PyInitError'"" error mean when trying to package a C module using 'distutil'?","Following my previous question here, I would like to import this C/C++ implementation of sha256 into my python script (Python 3.7.0) and run some performance tests. 
From the official documentation it seems that one way of doing this is to use distutil built-in module of python to package this as a new module and then install it so that it becomes importable to any script. 
The first step I took was to download the sha256module.c code and save it into my current directory. In the same directory, I then created a setup.py with the following content that python's documentation recommends here.
setup.py:
from distutils.core import setup
from distutils.extension import Extension
setup(name='sha256_test1',
      version='1.0',
      description = 'This is a test sha256 function',
      ext_modules=[Extension('sha256', sources = ['sha256module.c'])],
      )

After creating the setup file, from command prompt and in the same directory as the setup I run python setup.py build. In the first place, I received ""Unable to find vcvarsall.bat"" error and based on the answer to this question I installed visual studio 2017 community version on my Win10 x64 operating system. The error is gone. But I received errors indicating lack of some other files that seemed necessary for packaging. They are listed as:
hashlib.h
coreconfig.h
pystrhex.h
python.h
structmember.h
tracemalloc.h
clinic/sha256module.c.h

I added them to the current directory and when I run python setup.py build again I get another error saying ""note: see declaration of '_PyInitError"" which I assumed might be from the lack of __init__.py so I created an empty one but it didn't work.
I am not sure if I am doing this all the way right. What do you think about this procedure?! Am I on the correct direction?! If yes please tell me how to tackle the error and if no please indicate why and where I am doing wrong.

"53230792","Changing algorithm constants of a hash object created by hashlib","I am wondering if it is possible to modify (by parameter) the hash algorithms of python's hashlib library. For example, I would like to run sha256 with initial hashes that are different to the standard initial hashes of sha256.
Now the standard initial hashes are:
initHash = [0x6A09E667, 0xBB67AE85, 0x3C6EF372, 0xA54FF53A, 0x510E527F, 0x9B05688C, 0x1F83D9AB, 0x5BE0CD19]

I would like to modify this to my own purpose.
Currently, I can do this with the function I have written for sha256 by my own, but my code runs quite slower than hashlib. That is why I would like to use hashlib while having access to the parameters.
In other words, I'am asking to see if it is possible in hashlib to run a hash algorithm with non-standard user-defined algorithm constants.

should fix it.
Also, don't execute SQL like this!

"58438740","is it possible to find files and filepaths by only using a hash","is it possible to find a file by only inputting a hash (preferably sha256) and getting a filepath?
its also ok if i can immediately delete the file.
im trying to make like some sort of virus scan, i know this is not  good way is but its good enough for me.
i hope is can go something like this:
hash = 'hash'

path = find_file(hash, C:)

print(path)


i know this is not the best explanation but i hope someone can help me out.
its a school project and the time is tight.
thanks!
","It is only possible if the files you are searching through already have a hash associated with them. If not, you would first have to create a hash from each file's data and then check to see if that hash value matched the hash you were looking for.
