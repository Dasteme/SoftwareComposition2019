","You'll need to set the cipher mode to CipherMode.ECB or use an IV.

Another point is not to use Unicode encoding. Use Base64 instead. Unicode might ""destroy"" bytes that are not UTF-16.

There is a difference between encrypting and encoding.
Do you really need AES-256? The security of AES-256 versus AES-128 isn't that significant; you're more likely to screw up at the protocol layer than get hacked because you used a 128-bit block cipher instead of a 256-bit block cipher.

Usage
First, generate two keys (yes, two of them) and store them somehow.
$eKey = random_bytes(32);
$aKey = random_bytes(32);

Then to encrypt/decrypt messages:
$plaintext = 'This is just a test message.';
$encrypted = ExperimentalAES256DoNotActuallyUse::encrypt($plaintext, $eKey, $aKey);
$decrypted = ExperimentalAES256DoNotActuallyUse::decrypt($encrypted, $eKey, $aKey);

If you don't have random_bytes(), get random_compat.

In the test function, I have written the following three test cases.

A new value (value1) being encrypted and decrypted using a secret key.
Two example encrypted values (enctypedValue1, enctypedValue2) which are being decrypted using same secret key. encryptedValue2 which got a problem while decrypting using same secret key.
A new value (value4) being encrypted and decrypted using a secret key.

On decrypting encryptedValue2 I am getting the following exception:
Illegal Block Size Exception Input length must be multiple of 16 when decrypting with padded cipher

Following is what I have derived till now.

The problematic value seems to have a problem while decoding it, it returns 81 length array which is unable to get decrypted?
If this problem was to happen it should have happened to all the values.
Is this a value specific problem or it is something related to padding or it can have a different behavior on different browser, different os?

","I was able to run the code without any problem. However, I used Apache's Base64 for encoding/decoding...maybe your Base64 has bugs. If you wrote it yourself, there is a big chance that you missed some cases. For real production code, use heavily tested libraries such as Apache's.

","AES is a United States federal standard, FIPS 197, which is a subset of Rijndael:

AES has a fixed block size of 128 bits and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits, whereas Rijndael can be specified with block and key sizes in any multiple of 32 bits, with a minimum of 128 bits and a maximum of 256 bits.

","Strictly speaking, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is not an algorithm. AES is a specification defined by the National Institute of Standards & Technology of the United States (NIST). AES is the successor of the Data Encryption Standard (DES). 
AES has been announced in FIPS PUB 197 on November 26, 2001. Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUB) are issued by NIST after approval by the US Secretary of Commerce. 
Rijndael is a symmetric key encryption algorithm created by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. It is a block cipher, with variable block size, variable key length & variable round number. Block length and key length can be independently specified to any multiple of 32 bits from 128 bits to 256 bits. 
The Rijndael cipher as been selected as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
In the Rijndael AES variant the block size is restricted to 128 bits and key length to 128, 192 or 256 bits only.

","Do you really want to trust the user to give you back the right value? If you trust what the client gives you back and the user figures out your encryption scheme you'll be using data they provide. That sounds like a very bad idea. 
It's not clear to me why you don't want to give them a key into a database that maps a random numbers, perhaps with some error correction properties, to the coupon discounts. That way you have control of the final result. They provide you a key, you look up the associated coupon and apply the coupon. In this way you're only using your own data and if you want to remove a coupon it's all on the server side. 
If you keep all the key-codes you can also check that new codes are different from previously released ones.

","The solution is kind of from scratch but based on this: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/9508/looking-for-a-bijective-discrete-function-that-behaves-as-chaotically-as-possib
The simplest way presented is using a * x + b (mod 2^n)
Obviously this is no real encryption and really only useful if you want to create sequential coupon codes without using much code.
So to implement this, you first need to pick a, b and n. (a must be odd) For example a=17, b=37 and n=27. Also we need to find ""a^(-1)"" on ""mod 2^n"". It's possible to do this on https://www.wolframalpha.com using the ExtendedGcd function:

So the inverse of a is therefore 15790321. Putting all this together:
A=17
B=37
A_INV=15790321

def encrypt(x)
  (A*x+B)%(2**27)
end

def decrypt(y)
  ((y-B)*A_INV)%(2**27)
end

And now you can do:
irb(main):038:0> encrypt(4)
=> 105
irb(main):039:0> decrypt(105)
=> 4

Obviously we want the coupon codes to look cool. So 2 extra things are needed: start the sequence at 4000 or so, so the codes are longer. Also convert them into something alpha-numeric, that's also an easy one with Ruby:
irb(main):050:0> decrypt(""1ghx"".to_i(36))
=> 4000
irb(main):051:0> encrypt(4000).to_s(36)
=> ""1ghx""

One nice additional property is that consecutive numbers are different enough that guessing is practically impossible. Of course we assume that the users are not crypto analysts and if someone indeed guesses a valid number, it's not the end of the world: :-)
irb(main):053:0> encrypt(4001).to_s(36)
=> ""1gie""
irb(main):054:0> decrypt(""1gie"".to_i(36))
=> 4001

Let's try to naively ""hack"" it by counting from 1gie to 1gif:
irb(main):059:0* decrypt(""1gif"".to_i(36))
=> 15794322

That's completely out of range, there are just 2000 or so coupons anyways - not a million. :-) Also if I remember correctly one can experiment a bit with the parameters, so subsequent numbers look more chaotic.
(Pick a larger n for longer codes and vice-versa. Base 36 means 6 bits are needed for each character (""Math.log(36, 2)""). So n=27 allows for up to 5 characters.)

","Disclaimer
The encryption algorithm used in this answer is very basic and can be easily broken by any individual with medium to high skills in cryptography. It is used in the solution because the OP is asking for a simple symmetric solution without requiring any library.
Principle
The solution is based on the XOR cipher. From the Wikipedia: 

In cryptography, the simple XOR cipher is a type of additive cipher, an encryption algorithm that operates according to the principles:
A X 0 = A,
A X A = 0,
(A X B) X C = A X (B X C),
(B X A) X A = B X 0 = B,
where X denotes the XOR operation.

Pieces of the puzzle
My proposed solution is based in this basic routine:
function XorCipher(const Key, Source: TBytes): TBytes;
var
  I: Integer;
begin
  if Length(Key) = 0 then
    Exit(Source);
  SetLength(Result, Length(Source));
  for I := Low(Source) to High(Source) do
    Result[I] := Key[I mod Length(Key)] xor Source[I];
end;

The routine accepts a key and the source data as an array of bytes, and returns the resulting XORed array of bytes. The same routine functions to encrypt and to decrypt information, given the same key is used in both operations. To encrypt, the source is the plain data, and to decrypt, the source is the encrypted data.
I made two auxiliary routines to allow storing the result as a string. One to convert an array of bytes to a textual sequence of hexadecimal numbers, and the other to perform the reverse conversion:
function BytesToStr(const Bytes: TBytes): string;
var
  I: Integer;
begin
  Result := '';
  for I := Low(Bytes) to High(Bytes) do
    Result := Result + LowerCase(IntToHex(Bytes[I], 2));
end;

function StrToBytes(const value: string): TBytes;
var
  I: Integer;
begin
  SetLength(Result, Length(value) div 2);
  for I := Low(Result) to High(Result) do
    Result[I] := StrToIntDef('$' + Copy(value, (I * 2) + 1, 2), 0);
end;

With this foundations, you can build all of what you need. For convenience and test my code, I created some other routines, for example:

this one to store the key inside the exe and get it as a TBytes value
function GetKey: TBytes;
begin
  Result := TArray<Byte>.Create(
     $07, $14, $47, $A0, $F4, $F7, $FF, $48, $21, $32
   , $AF, $87, $09, $8E, $B3, $C0, $7D, $54, $45, $87
   , $8A, $A8, $23, $32, $00, $56, $11, $1D, $98, $FA
  );
end;

you can provide a key of any length, since it rolls to encrypt the data inside XorCipher routine.
this one to properly encode a given string using that key:
function XorEncodeStr(const Source: string): string; overload;
var
  BSource: TBytes;
begin
  SetLength(BSource, Length(Source) * SizeOf(Char));
  Move(Source[1], BSource[0], Length(Source) * SizeOf(Char));
  Result := XorEncodeToStr(GetKey, BSource);
end;

this other to properly decode a encoded string to a string
function XorDecodeStr(const Source: string): string; overload;
var
  BResult: TBytes;
begin
  BResult := XorDecodeFromStr(GetKey, source);
  Result := TEncoding.Unicode.GetString( BResult );
end;


Writing the INI file
With this routines accessible to the place where you write and read your INI file, you can easily write and read it, for example:
procedure TForm1.SaveIni;
var
  Ini: TIniFile;
  I: Integer;
begin
  Ini := TIniFile.Create('.\config.ini');
  try
    Ini.WriteInteger('config', 'NumEntries', ListBox1.Items.Count);
    for I := 0 to ListBox1.Items.Count - 1 do
      Ini.WriteString('listbox', IntToStr(I), XorEncodeStr(listbox1.Items[I]));
  finally
    Ini.Free;
  end;
end;

procedure TForm1.LoadIni;
var
  Ini: TIniFile;
  Max, I: Integer;
begin
  ListBox1.Items.Clear;
  Ini := TIniFile.Create('.\config.ini');
  try
    Max := Ini.ReadInteger('config', 'NumEntries', 0);
    for I := 0 to Max - 1 do
      ListBox1.Items.Add(
        XorDecodeStr(Ini.ReadString('listbox', IntToStr(I), ''))
      );
  finally
    Ini.Free;
  end;
end;

This is not production ready-code, since it's written only to test the solution, but it is also a starting point for you to make it rock-solid.
A word of caution
This is not strong cryptography, so, don't rely on this to store really sensitive information. One weak point is the key is contained inside your exe in plain form. You can work on this, but the main weakens is the algorithm itself. 
Take as an example of this issue the following: since you're encoding Unicode Delphi strings in UTF-16 format, the second byte of each character is usually zero (unless you're in the east or a country with a non-latin alphabet), and you will find the exact bytes of the key repeats in your encoded stored strings. You can make this less apparent by not using a plain hexadecimal representation of the encoded data (for example encoding it using base64 as already suggested here).
You can resort to AnsiStrings to avoid revealing this parts of your key, or you can code your key with explicit zero bytes (or other constant byte) in the even positions.
Anything of this will work if the users of your software are not cryptographically educated, but the fact is that anyone with a medium level of knowledge and good skills can get the key by analyzing your data. If the user knows a un-encoded value, it gets easier.

","First off, see this link for the wincrypt unit I'm using since I used it here.  
What this does for encryption is take the string that's put into it (you are using INI so it's all single strings anyway, right?), and then runs it through the WinCrypt 3DES based on a password entered in, and then since that produces binary, I run that through Base64.  For decryption, I reverse the process.  An incorrect password produces garbage on decryption, but for the amount that I tested it, it seems to work right as long as the password is right for both steps.  Of course, I may have forgotten to do some cleanup, but if that is the case it can readily be fixed.

Quick usage example:

   var
     password1: AnsiString;
   begin
     password1 := 'Test1';
     Edit2.Text := EncryptStringA(Edit1.Text, password1);
   end;

 procedure TForm1.Button2Click(Sender: TObject);
   var
     password1: AnsiString;
   begin
     password1 := 'Test1';
     Label1.Caption := DecryptStringA(Edit2.Text, password1);
   end;

 procedure TForm1.Button3Click(Sender: TObject);
   var
     password1: WideString;
   begin
     password1 := 'Test1';
     Edit2.Text := EncryptStringW(Edit1.Text, password1);
   end;

 procedure TForm1.Button4Click(Sender: TObject);
   var
     password1: WideString;
   begin
     password1 := 'Test1';
     Label1.Caption := DecryptStringW(Edit2.Text, password1);
   end;

Hope it helps out someone.
Using ""Edit1"" as input.  Correct output for encryption ANSI: 3+Pp7o8aErc=   Correct output for encryption WideString: HijzDYgRr/Y= 
Edit: I posted WideString versions as well.  I downloaded the XE3 demo to look at and play with.  This code works there as well as Turbo Delphi 2006 and Delphi 3, so if you have difficulty check the line(s) that I put comments on about the Windows XP Base64 implementation not honoring CRYPT_STRING_NOCRLF, because if you are on a Windows that does, the line needs to be changed for this to work right.  Regardless, for the OP's stated intention we DO NOT want $13$10 to appear in the encoded text

","If you have a character, a char, you can convert it to an integer, an int.
And then you can use the ^ operator to perform XOR on it. You don't appear to be using that operator at the moment, which might be the source of your problem.
string EncryptOrDecrypt(string text, string key)
{
    var result = new StringBuilder();

    for (int c = 0; c < text.Length; c++)
        result.Append((char)((uint)text[c] ^ (uint)key[c % key.Length]));

    return result.ToString();
}

That kind of thing. Here's a longer version with comments that does the same thing in steps, to make it easier to learn from:
string EncryptOrDecrypt(string text, string key)
{
    var result = new StringBuilder();

    for (int c = 0; c < text.Length; c++)
    {
        // take next character from string
        char character = text[c];

        // cast to a uint
        uint charCode = (uint)character;

        // figure out which character to take from the key
        int keyPosition = c % key.Length; // use modulo to ""wrap round""

        // take the key character
        char keyChar = key[keyPosition];

        // cast it to a uint also
        uint keyCode = (uint)keyChar;

        // perform XOR on the two character codes
        uint combinedCode = charCode ^ keyCode;

        // cast back to a char
        char combinedChar = (char)combinedCode;

        // add to the result
        result.Append(combineChar);
    }

    return result.ToString();
}

The short version is the same but with the intermediate variables removed, substituting expressions directly into where they're used.

","I notice a couple of possible issues:

The call to AES_set_decrypt_key uses the same key as the previous call thus overwriting the key value.  To make both calls up front like that, it would be necessary to use a separate key instance.  Otherwise wait to call AES_set_decrypt_key until after the encryption is done.
The key buffer passed to AES_set_encrypt_key needs to be 16 bytes long for the bit depth of 128.  As it is, it will read 16 bytes, but the contents of those are undefined.

","Practical PKI-based encryption systems use asymmetric encryption to encrypt a symmetric key, and then symmetric encryption with that key to encrypt the data (having said that, someone will point out a counter-example).
So the additional overhead imposed by asymmetric crypto algorithms over that of symmetric is fixed - it doesn't depend on the data size, just on the key sizes.
Last time I tested this, validating a chain of 3 or so X.509 certificates [edit to add: and the data they were signing] was taking a fraction of a second on an ARM running at 100MHz or so (averaged over many repetitions, obviously). I can't remember how small - not negligible, but well under a second.
Sorry I can't remember the exact details, but the summary is that unless you're on a very restricted system or doing a lot of encryption (like if you want to accept as many as possible SSL connections a second), NIST-approved asymmetric encryption methods are fast.

","Yes, purely asymmetric encryption is much slower than symmetric cyphers (like DES or AES), which is why real applications use hybrid cryptography: the expensive public-key operations are performed only to encrypt (and exchange) an encryption key for the symmetric algorithm that is going to be used for encrypting the real message.
The problem that public-key cryptography solves is that there is no shared secret. With a symmetric encryption you have to trust all involved parties to keep the key secret. This issue should be a much bigger concern than performance (which can be mitigated with a hybrid approach)

","Perhaps you can add some details about your project so that you get better quality answers.  What are you trying to secure?  From whom?  If you could explain the requirements of your security, you'll get a much better answer.  Performance doesn't mean much if the encryption mechanism isn't protecting what you think it is.
For instance, X509 certs are an industrial standard way of securing client/server endpoints.  PGP armoring can be used to secure license files.  For simplicity, Cipher block chaining with Blowfish (and a host of other ciphers) is easy to use in Perl or Java, if you control both end points.

","On a Macbook running OS X 10.5.5 and a stock build of OpenSSL, ""openssl speed"" clocks AES-128-CBC at 46,000 1024 bit blocks per second. That same box clocks 1024 bit RSA at 169 signatures per second. AES-128-CBC is the ""textbook"" block encryption algorithm, and RSA 1024 is the ""textbook"" public key algorithm. It's apples-to-oranges, but the answer is: RSA is much, much slower.
That's not why you shouldn't be using public key encryption, however. Here's the real reasons:

Public key crypto operations aren't intended for raw data encryption. Algorithms like Diffie-Hellman and RSA were devised as a way of exchanging keys for block crypto algorithms. So, for instance, you'd use a secure random number generator to generate a 128 bit random key for AES, and encrypt those 16 bytes with RSA.
Algorithms like RSA are much less ""user-friendly"" than AES. With a random key, a plaintext block you feed to AES is going to come out random to anyone without the key. That is actually not the case with RSA, which is --- more so than AES --- just a math equation. So in addition to storing and managing keys properly, you have to be extremely careful with the way you format your RSA plaintext blocks, or you end up with vulnerabilities. 
Public key doesn't work without a key management infrastructure. If you don't have a scheme to verify public keys, attackers can substitute their own keypairs for the real ones to launch ""man in the middle"" attacks. This is why SSL forces you to go through the rigamarole of certificates. Block crypto algorithms like AES do suffer from this problem too, but without a PKI, AES is no less safe than RSA.
Public key crypto operations are susceptible to more implementation vulnerabilities than AES. For example, both sides of an RSA transaction have to agree on parameters, which are numbers fed to the RSA equation. There are evil values attackers can substitute in to silently disable encryption. The same goes for Diffie Hellman and even more so for Elliptic Curve. Another example is the RSA Signature Forgery vulnerability that occurred 2 years ago in multiple high-end SSL implementations.
Using public key is evidence that you're doing something ""out of the ordinary"". Out of the ordinary is exactly what you never want to be with cryptography; beyond just the algorithms, crypto designs are audited and tested for years before they're considered safe. 

To our clients who want to use cryptography in their applications, we make two recommendations:

For ""data at rest"", use PGP. Really! PGP has been beat up for more than a decade and is considered safe from dumb implementation mistakes. There are open source and commercial variants of it.
For ""data in flight"", use TLS/SSL. No security protocol in the world is better understood and better tested than TLS; financial institutions everywhere accept it as a secure method to move the most sensitive data.

Here's a decent writeup [matasano.com] me and Nate Lawson, a professional cryptographer, wrote up a few years back. It covers these points in more detail.

","Yes, the hybrid encryption offered by standardized cryptographic schemes like PGP, TLS, and CMS does impose a fixed performance cost on each message or session. How big that impact is depends on the algorithms selected and which operation you are talking about.
For RSA, decryption and signing operations are relatively slow, because it requires modular exponentiation with a large private exponent. RSA encryption and signature verification, on the other hand, is very fast, because it uses the small public exponent. This difference scales quadratically with the key length.
Under ECC, because peers are doing the same math with keys of similar size, operations are more balanced than RSA. In an integrated encryption scheme, an ephemeral EC key can be generated, and used in a key agreement algorithm; that requires a little extra work for the message sender. ECDH key agreement is much, much slower than RSA encryption, but much faster than RSA decryption.
In terms of relative numbers, decrypting with AES might be 100,000x faster than decrypting with RSA. In terms of absolute numbers, depending heavily on hardware, AES might take a few nanoseconds per block, while RSA takes a millisecond or two. And that prompts the question, why would anyone use asymmetric algorithms, ever?
The answer is that these algorithms are used together, for different purposes, in hybrid encryption schemes. Fast, symmetric algorithms like AES are used to protect the message itself, and slow, asymmetric algorithms like RSA are used in turn to protect the keys needed by the symmetric algorithms. This is what allows parties that have never previously shared any secret information, like you and your search engine, to communicate securely with each other.

Here's the text (JSON) that I am encrypting (sensitive information removed):

UPDATE: I'm using ASCII keys in the format needed by PHP. If I generate keys from the RijndaelManaged class they dont work on the PHP side, but I can use keys that are known to work on PHP side and use them in the RijndaelManaged C# side.
Please let me know if I left out any pertinent information. TIA!
","Since the string is partially OK, but there is gibberish at the end it would suggest a padding problem within the encryption which expects exact blocks of 256 bytes. I suggest setting the padding as PKCS7 (PaddingMode.PKCS7) instead of Zeros on the C# side which PHP will understand without issues (as it's the default mode on that parser).
Edit: Oops, I did not notice that you had the following in your PHP:
$enc = $_COOKIE[""MyCookie""];

This is the caveat. PHP is likely not getting the encrypted data as-is and is running some urldecode sanitizing. You should print this variable to see that it really matches what is being sent from the C# code.
Edit2:
Convert the whitespaces to missing + characters from the cookie by adding this:
str_replace(' ', '+', $enc);

"11873878","C# Encryption to PHP Decryption","I'm trying to encrypt some (cookie) data in C# and then decrypt it in PHP. I have chosen to use Rijndael encryption. I've almost got it working, except only part of the text is decrypted! I started working from this example: Decrypt PHP encrypted string in C#
Here's the text (JSON) that I am encrypting (sensitive information removed):
{""DisplayName"":""xxx"", ""Username"": ""yyy"", ""EmailAddress"":""zzz""}

So I login to the C# app which creates/encodes the cookie from stored Key and IV and then redirects to the PHP app which is supposed to decrypt/read the cookie. When I decrypt the cookie, it comes out like this:

{""DisplayName"":""xxx"",""F�A ;��HP=D�������4��z����ť���k�#E���R�j�5�\�t. t�D��"" 

UPDATE: i've gotten a little bit further and this is now the result
string(96) ""{""DisplayName"":""xxx"",""Username"":""yyy"",""EmailAddress""�)ق��-�J��k/VV-v� �9�B`7^"" 

As you can see, it starts decrypting it, but then gets messed up...

When Decrypt the string it comes out correct (with padding, which I have a function to remove padding), but if I change the test string by one character I get garbage again:

The jsbn library is a fast, portable implementation of large-number math in pure JavaScript, enabling public-key crypto and other applications on desktop and mobile browsers.

Use CryptoAPI and Rijndael

","Your approach is good, with a few adjustments in my eyes (I code for PCI compliance generally):

Use CryptoAPI and Rijndael

Use Rijndael/AES256 at a minimum, regardless of other APIs

Generate IV and store it with the encrypted data

Good

Use DPAPI (Machine scope) to ""protect"" the symmetric key

Not sure if it matters. I'd just keep the IV next to the data that's encrypted, or if you're really paranoid on some other medium. Ensure that the IV is not accessible to the public.

Store the symmetric key in the registry or a file or the database, split the key and store parts in multiple places for added protection

Storing in multiple places will not help you if someone steals your media. It's a bit overkill to split the key up all over heck, but definitely do NOT store it with your IV and/or ciphertext. That'd be bad.

do not decrypt the data unless it is really needed, i.e. not upon read from the database. Instead, hold cipher text in memory.

Definitely. Holding cipher text in memory in fine, but don't pass it around anywhere, and don't decrypt except when you absolutely must, and even then don't EXPOSE the entire unencrypted dataset - only what is needed from it at the minimum. Also, do not hold the key in memory if possible - a memory dump could expose it.
Additions:

Whatever database you store your cipher text in, restrict read access entirely to the proc(s) that select for a given identifier. Do not allow read access to the tables that store this data to ANYONE, even the SA account. This way, a person who breaks into your system will have a hard time pulling down your cipher texts without knowing what IDs to look for. Do the same for any table(s) referencing the identifier on the ciphertext table. DO NOT ALLOW BLANKET READS OF THESE TABLES!
Restrict database access by IP
Never persist any unencrypted plaintext in memory over state. Allow it to be dereferenced/garbage collected as soon as the request is completed.
Restrict the server(s) running this code to as few users as possible.
Possibly combine encryption methods for a stronger ciphertext (AES + Blowfish for example)

Hope these help. Some of them are my personal opinions but remain PCI compliant to the best of my knowledge.

","I would add:

Keeping the IV hidden is not important. It's OK if the IV is public. Just use good IVs, which means, use a cryptographic-strong random number generator so that your IVs are indistinguishable from random.
Storing the encryption key separate from the data that it encrypts.
Add authentication to your encryption. For example, add an HMAC keyed with a second symmetric encryption key, covering the ciphertext. If you don't use some form of authenticated encryption, then your ciphertext could be modified, and you have no way of knowing (AES will decrypt garbage just fine.) You want any tampering of the ciphertext to be noticed.

","Taken more generic list of best practices, from OWASP (Cryptographic Storage Cheat Sheet):

Use strong approved cryptographic algorithms


Do not implement an existing cryptographic algorithm on your own
Only use approved public algorithms such as AES, RSA public key cryptography, and SHA-256 or better for hashing
Do not use weak algorithms, such as MD5 or SHA1
Avoid hashing for password storage, instead use Argon2, PBKDF2, bcrypt or scrypt

Use approved cryptographic modes


In general, you should not use AES, DES or other symmetric cipher primitives directly. NIST approved modes should be used instead. Quote from Nist: ""The approved algorithms for encryption/decryption are symmetric key algorithms: AES and TDEA.""

Use strong random numbers
Ensure that any secret key is protected from unauthorized access


Also, according to this Cisco article:

DES is to be avoided and so is RSA-768, -1024
RSA-2048 and RSA-3072 are acceptable
AES-CBC mode is acceptable, while
AES-GCM mode is part of the Next Generation Encription.

"11511410","AES cipher in GCM, CCM, or CBC-MAC mode?","I've been looking around for an article describing these modes in layman's terms but have not yet found anything helpful. So, what are the positives and negatives of each mode? 
Thanks
GCM
CCM
CBC-MAC
","CCM-
this mode accepts a variable-length authentication tags from 32-bits to 128-bits so it actually allowing varying degrees of protection against unauthorized modifications the cons:

The CCM mode dose not provide for confidentiality-only services. in some cases,  it
uses data authenticity mechanism from external.

GCM-
The encryption and authentication of GCM are secure against the chosen-plaintext attack, and GCM is also secure while using the AES block cipher. but:

There are security problems when reusing the IV

For both GCM and CCM you have to use timestamps or replay attack can occur and of course you need an appropriate tag length.
for CBC-MAC it depends because you use CBC to create the MAC and CBC offers serial encryption and parallel decryption but a change of one bit in a block changes everything that comes after in the encryption but doesn't affect the decryption. A known problem with CBC-MAC is using the same key for encryption and for authentication in this case if you use CBC mode so the last block would be the MAC.

","I see two problems:

You are not flushing and closing the streams before calling ms.ToArray(). Change it to:
...
using (var cs = new CryptoStream(ms, crypt.CreateEncryptor(), CryptoStreamMode.Write))
{
    cs.Write(clearData, 0, clearData.Length);
    cs.FlushFinalBlock();
    cs.Close();
}

ms.Close();
encryptedData = ms.ToArray();
...

In Encrypt the resulting byte array encryptedData is NOT a Unicode string, yet you are using a Unicode encoder to get a string from the byte array.  Instead of that use System.Convert.ToBase64String() in Encrypt and System.Convert.FromBase64String() in Decrypt.

In Encrypt do:
return System.Convert.ToBase64String(encryptedData);

In Decrypt do:
byte[] encryptedData = System.Convert.FromBase64String(cipherText);

EDIT
The biggest problem is the return value of Encrypt. The result of encrypting the byte representation of a Unicode string is NOT a byte representation of a Unicode string.  You should not use the value of encryptedData with Encoding.Unicode.GetString() to get a string representation of the encrypted data. Use System.Convert.ToBase64String() to get a string representation of the encrypted data.  Please see the Remarks section in the Encoding Class MSDN Documentation.
EDIT 2
Note that Rijndael is not exactly AES, if you are interoperating with AES the block size should always be 128-bits, independent of the key size. For details you can read about it here.

","I have spend a lot of my time for finding what was causing CryptographicException and I was googling too including Stackoverflow.
It was a stupid mistake (as often when programming with copy-paste) as follow:
It was throwing on method FlushFinalBlock() from instance of CryptoStream.
Look at WRONG code:
CryptoStream cs = new CryptoStream(ms, rj.CreateDecryptor(rj.Key, rj.IV), CryptoStreamMode.Write);

I used it to encrypt so you can see CryptoStreamMode.Write but in the same instruction I was creating decryptor instead of encryptor (see second parameter in the constructor).
Be careful and check it to avoid wasting your precious time ;)

","When you generate a random IV, you get raw binary. There's a nonzero chance that the binary strings will contain a : or \0 character, which you're using to separate the IV from the ciphertext. Doing so makes explode() give you a shorter string. Demo: https://3v4l.org/3ObfJ
The trivial solution would be to add base64 encoding/decoding to this process.

That said, please don't roll your own crypto. In particular, unauthenticated encryption is dangerous and there are already secure libraries that solve this problem.
Instead of writing your own, consider just using defuse/php-encryption. This is the safe choice.

","I've seen the code posted on the internet. There are - in principle - not too many things wrong with it, but there is no need to invent your own padding. Furthermore, I don't see why the first padding character is called INTERRUPT. I presume that INTERRUPT and PAD is handled as a single byte (I'm not a Python expert).
The most common padding is PKCS#5 padding. It consists of N bytes with the value of the number of padding bytes. The padding used here looks more like 'ISO' padding, which consists of a single bit set to 1 to distinguish it from the data and other padding bits, and the rest is zero's. That would be code point \u0080 in code.
So the encryption (which can provide confidentiality of data) seems to be used correctly. It depends on the use case if you also need integrity protection and/or authentication, e.g. by using a MAC or HMAC. Of course, no legal guarantees or anything provided.

"7016884","gpg-agent in gpg2","I'm attempting to futureproof some custom software that utilizes GPG (currently v 1.4.10) to perform symmetric encryption/decryption processes. My current encryption command looks like this:
gpg --batch --no-tty --no-use-agent --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 --passphrase ""foobar"" /path/to/file_to_be_encrypted

Without the --no-use-agent option, I get the infamous error message

gpg-agent is not available in this session

I'm concerned about a move to gpg2 because, according to the documentation, the gpg-agent is always required, and --no-use-agent is simply a dummy option. My gpg calls occur in the background via a daemon process, so this is very much a no-agent scenario (plus the fact that it's symmetric, and I have no need of the agent at all).
Documentation at this level of detail is sparse, so I'm looking for user experience. Does gpg2 incorporate the agent more tightly, so that I don't have to worry about its availability?
","
The way you invoke gpg2, it might fail if the output file path/to/file_to_be_encrypted.gpg already exists. If you want the file to be overwritten, you should provide the --yes option:
gpg2 --batch --yes --no-tty --no-use-agent --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 --passphrase ""foobar"" /path/to/file_to_be_encrypted

When you are using symmetric encryption (like you do), the passphrase constraints (even if set to enforced by gpg-agent) will not be applied at all—it will just work.
Say the gpg-agent was run like this (and let the mypasswords file even contain the forbidden pattern that exactly matches your password):
eval $(gpg-agent --daemon --enforce-passphrase-constraints --min-passphrase-len 8 --min-passphrase-nonalpha 4 --check-passphrase-pattern mypasswords)

Then your command would still succeed.
In short: gpg-agent will not make it fail (unless it crashes gpg for some reason—like wrong configuration or missing executable, which you cannot account for).
EDIT: I've just checked and in symmetric mode gpg2 will work even if gpg-agent is wrongly configured or if the gpg-agent executable is missing.
This is not related, but just in case: I also verified what happens when you try to change the password of your private key while gpg-agent is missing or is wrongly configured: gpg2 will report a warning, will not even ask for the new passphrase, and continue working.

I need to use it only to encrypt/decrypt integers.
","The requirement for no external library reduces the list to DES, 3DES and AES. DES and 3DES have a block size of 64 bits whereas AES has a block size of 128 bits. There are different aspects, one can examine this for.
Ciphertext size
DES and 3DES are best used for integers that are at most 56-bit wide (non-full long), because the result will be a single block of 8 byte, because of padding. If you encrypt a full long value, then an additional padding block will be added.
AES will always produce a 16 byte ciphertext for any int of long value.
Speed
According to this analysis AES (Rijndael-128) is more than twice as fast as DES/3DES with a bigger key size (more secure). AES can be even much faster than DES or 3DES when the CPU supports AES-NI. All current CPUs support this. This is my current result for taken from the openssl speed command.
AES achieves 127MB/s for 16 byte payloads whereas 3DES only achieves 27MB/s. Here's the data to poke around.
Security
Don't use DES for anything serious, because it only has a 56-bit key (64-bit with parity). Brute forcing cost is 256. 3DES is also not that good, because Brute forcing cost is 2112. Brute forcing cost for AES is 2128, 2192, 2256 depending on the used key size.
Code
Probably use AES:
private final String CIPHER_NAME = ""AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding"";
private final String ALGORITHM_NAME = ""AES""; // keySizes 128, 192, 256
// private final String CIPHER_NAME = ""DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding"";
// private final String ALGORITHM_NAME = ""DES""; // keySize 56
// private final String CIPHER_NAME = ""DESede/ECB/PKCS5Padding"";
// private final String ALGORITHM_NAME = ""DESede""; // keySize 168

byte[] encrypt(SecretKey key, long num) {
    BigInteger bignum = BigInteger.valueOf(num);
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(CIPHER_NAME);
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
    return cipher.doFinal(bignum.toByteArray());
}

long decrypt(SecretKey key, byte[] ct) {
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(CIPHER_NAME);
    cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key);
    byte[] pt = cipher.doFinal(ct);
    BigInteger bignum = new BigInteger(pt);
    return bignum.longValue();
}

SecretKey keyGen(String algorithm, int keySize) {
    KeyGenerator keygen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(algorithm);
    keygen.init(keySize);
    return keygen.generateKey();
}

Mode of operation
Here I use ECB mode. It is generally not a good idea to use it. It has a problem that encrypting the same plaintext with the same key results in the same ciphertext. This may not be a property that is acceptable. If it is not acceptable, then you need to use for example CBC mode with a new random IV. With will blow up the ciphertext by an additional block.

","The problem is that I was using:
passwordDB.GetBytes(256 / 8)

within the constructor for the RijndaelManaged object in both the Encryption and Decryption methods, and I wasn't re-initialising the passwordDB object before attempting to decrypt.
The resolution was to simply including the construction of the passwordDB object within the first lines of both the Enc and Dec methods, as follows:
        private static void Enc(string decryptedFileName, string encryptedFileName)
        {
            PasswordDeriveBytes passwordDB = new PasswordDeriveBytes(""ThisIsMyPassword"", Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(""thisIsMysalt!""), ""MD5"", 2);
            byte[] passwordBytes = passwordDB.GetBytes(128 / 8);

            using (FileStream fsOutput = File.OpenWrite(encryptedFileName))
            {
                using(FileStream fsInput = File.OpenRead(decryptedFileName))
                {
                    byte[] IVBytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(""1234567890123456"");

                    fsOutput.Write(BitConverter.GetBytes(fsInput.Length), 0, 8);
                    fsOutput.Write(IVBytes, 0, 16);

                    RijndaelManaged symmetricKey = new RijndaelManaged() { Mode = CipherMode.CBC,Padding=PaddingMode.ANSIX923};
                    ICryptoTransform encryptor = symmetricKey.CreateEncryptor(passwordBytes, IVBytes);

"3351285","Using Rijndael encryption for large files","I'm in a situation where I need to encrypt / decrypt a file of n length securely, ideally using Rijndael, but definitely at 256bit encryption.
I've played around with encryption before and have encrypted/decrypted strings and byte arrays quite happily.
However, because I don't know the size of the file (and it's very feasible that the files in question could be quite large (~2.5gb) I can't just load them up into a byte array and enc/decrypt them in a single bound as I have before.
So, after a bit of reading around on Google, I knew the answer was to encrypt and decrypt the file in chunks, and so I produced the following code:
private static void Enc(string decryptedFileName, string encryptedFileName)
{            
   FileStream fsOutput = File.OpenWrite(encryptedFileName);
   FileStream fsInput = File.OpenRead(decryptedFileName);

   byte[] IVBytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(""1234567890123456"");

   fsOutput.Write(BitConverter.GetBytes(fsInput.Length), 0, 8);
   fsOutput.Write(IVBytes, 0, 16);

   RijndaelManaged symmetricKey = new RijndaelManaged() { Mode = CipherMode.CBC};
   ICryptoTransform encryptor = symmetricKey.CreateEncryptor(passwordDB.GetBytes(256 / 8), IVBytes);
   CryptoStream cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(fsOutput, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write);

   for (long i = 0; i < fsInput.Length; i += chunkSize)
   {
      byte[] chunkData = new byte[chunkSize];
      fsInput.Read(chunkData, 0, chunkSize);
      cryptoStream.Write(chunkData, 0, chunkData.Length);
   }
   cryptoStream.Close();
   fsInput.Close();
   fsInput.Dispose();
   cryptoStream.Dispose();
}

private static void Dec(string encryptedFileName, string decryptedFileName)
{
    FileStream fsInput = File.OpenRead(encryptedFileName);
    FileStream fsOutput = File.OpenWrite(decryptedFileName);

    byte[] buffer = new byte[8];
    fsInput.Read(buffer, 0, 8);

    long fileLength = BitConverter.ToInt64(buffer, 0);

    byte[] IVBytes = new byte[16];
    fsInput.Read(IVBytes, 0, 16);

    RijndaelManaged symmetricKey = new RijndaelManaged() { Mode = CipherMode.CBC };
    ICryptoTransform decryptor = symmetricKey.CreateDecryptor(passwordDB.GetBytes(256 / 8), IVBytes);
    CryptoStream cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(fsOutput,decryptor,CryptoStreamMode.Write);

    for (long i = 0; i < fsInput.Length; i += chunkSize)
    {
        byte[] chunkData = new byte[chunkSize];
        fsInput.Read(chunkData, 0, chunkSize);
        cryptoStream.Write(chunkData, 0, chunkData.Length);
    }
    cryptoStream.Close();
    cryptoStream.Dispose();
    fsInput.Close();
    fsInput.Dispose();                      
} 

It all ""looks"" good to me, but sadly looks appear to be deceiving!
Encryption works without error, but during decryption, the ""cryptoStream.Close()"" method throws the following exception:

System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException
  was unhandled   Message=""Padding is
  invalid and cannot be removed.""
  Source=""mscorlib""   StackTrace:
         at System.Security.Cryptography.RijndaelManagedTransform.DecryptData(Byte[]

         at System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream.Dispose(Boolean
  disposing)
         at System.IO.Stream.Close()

It also appears that the unencrypted file size isn't matching the file size expected (ranging from around 8 bytes, to around 60)
I ""fixed"" the exception by altering the RijndaelManaged object creation lines to include a padding type, as below:
RijndaelManaged symmetricKey = new RijndaelManaged() { Mode = CipherMode.CBC,Padding=PaddingMode.None };

But the file sizes still don't match up and, predictably, the freshly unencrypted file is baloney!
I will admit that I'm now outside of my comfort zone with encryption/decryption, and it's probably a rookie mistake - but I can't spot it!
Any help on resolving this would be greatly appreciated!

As you can see it does not conform to 64 bit or 128 bit boundaries for me to use block ciphering algorithms and I do not want to pad the data as I have restriction on the length of encrypted data. The restriction is because I would be transforming using base 32 it to a printable key which cannot exceed 20 chars.

From what I understand, the pseudo random key generation is the only soultion fo this problem, but the solution that encrypts the data and solution that decrypts it, do not talk to each other. 
","Why not use RC4?  The cipher text is the exact same size as the clear text - in your case 12 bytes.  It comes with Java (5 or greater).  Here is an example:
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter;

public class MyArcFour
{
   public static void main(String [] args) throws Exception
   {
      byte [] key = ""MYVERYINSECUREKEY"".getBytes(""ASCII"");

      String clearText = ""123456789012"";

      Cipher rc4 = Cipher.getInstance(""RC4"");
      SecretKeySpec rc4Key = new SecretKeySpec(key, ""RC4"");
      rc4.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, rc4Key);

      byte [] cipherText = rc4.update(clearText.getBytes(""ASCII""));

      System.out.println(""clear (ascii)        "" + clearText);
      System.out.println(""clear (hex)          "" + DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(clearText.getBytes(""ASCII"")));
      System.out.println(""cipher (hex) is      "" + DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(cipherText));

      Cipher rc4Decrypt = Cipher.getInstance(""RC4"");
      rc4Decrypt.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, rc4Key);
      byte [] clearText2 = rc4Decrypt.update(cipherText);

      System.out.println(""decrypted (clear) is "" + new String(clearText2, ""ASCII""));
   }
}

This generates the following output:
clear (ascii)        123456789012
clear (hex)          313233343536373839303132
cipher (hex) is      CBFB9A712E55EBD985C8F2DF
decrypted (clear) is 123456789012

Of course you would want to use a better (longer, more random) key than in the example.

","You can use a stream cypher like RC4, but as you have found, you cannot reuse the key.  For a stream cypher use a key/nonce (nonce = Number used ONCE) combination.  The nonce can be as simple as 1, 2, 3, 4, ... or a date/time and will need to be stored alongside the cyphertext.  Change the key before the nonce recycles round to zero and starts to repeat.  If you use a date/time then ensure that the clock ticks fast enough never to repeat a value.
You have a long term key and a nonce.  Each time you want to encrypt something, hash them to get a session key:
sessionKey <- SHA256(longTermKey + nonce)

Use this session key once only, then throw it away.  Store the nonce for use in decrypting.  Increment a numerical nonce ready for the next use.  For date/time nonces insert a short delay to ensure the clock has changed.  The nonce must be different the next time it is used.
When you change the long term key, you will need to decrypt and re-encrypt all your data.  Alternatively pick a large bit-size for your nonce and keep your long term key very secure.

","It's really important that you change the data type of the database field to VARBINARY(MAX), that way you avoid issues with character encodings and byte combinations that cannot be interpreted as legal characters.
Also, I think the problem is that you are not closing the streams before calling ToArray() method on the MemoryStream in both encrypt and decrypt routines. It's very important to call Close() in the CryptoStream so that FlushFinalBlock() is called and the encryption process writes the final block to the stream.
Try moving the call to MemoryStream.ToArray() to the outer using block, that is, outside the using block of CryptoStream, so that Dispose() is called on the CryptoStream and call MemoryStream.Close() before that.
Another problem with your code is that you are wrapping the CryptoStream with a StreamWriter, which writes the text representation of the object you pass into the Write method.  You should instead write directly to the CryptoStream to avoid any byte to string conversions.

","Read the error and look at the documentation for TripleDES.Key:

This algorithm supports key lengths from 128 bits to 192 bits in increments of 64 bits.

That means for example
private const string MyKey = ""bla bla bla blah"";

would work.
You didn't ask about this, but I'm not sure creating this class as static is a good idea. If you used it from two different places in your code, it could result in unexpected results, because AlgorithmName is static.
Also, I don't think it makes sense to have a constant key but variable algorithm, especially since different algorithms require keys of different lengths.

","What is unclear about the warning? Provide a key of an acceptable size.
The key is what you have called $salt, it is not a salt, it is the encryption key. Rename it to make the code more clear.
Some instances may add padding bytes to the key but that is non-standard and may be different for different implementations. Do not trust parameter padding, specify the full length.
Also from th encrypt docs:

MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256 is not AES-256, it's a different variant of the Rijndael block cipher. If you want AES-256 in mcrypt, you have to use MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128 with a 32-byte key.

You should be using the AES options.
The code uses ECB mode which is not secure, should not be used and does not use a IV. Probably what you want to do is use CBC mode which does require an IV. The same IV will be needed for decryption.
There should be no need to trim Base64 encoding.
Lastly, nesting several levels of functions (6 here) may seem like a good idea but it makes debugging almost impossible since intermediate results can not be inspected.
Then there is mcrypt, it is best not to use mcrypt, it is abandonware, has not been updated in years and does not support standard PKCS#7 padding, only non-standard null padding that can't even be used with binary data. Instead consider using defuse, it is being maintained and is correct.

","In PHP 5.6 and higher, your $salt needs to be a random string that is either 16, 24 or 32 characters long. Your localhost probably still uses an older version of PHP.
This code should work both on localhost and on your server :
$text=""thisismypassword123"";
$salt=""ddv21sd5dv56sd51""; // <- 16 characters long

    base64_encode (

Note
Even though this code does work, there are still other issues with it you may want to consider.
See the other answers (most in particular Scott Arciszewski's answer) for details on what else is wrong with your code and why you shouldn't even be using mcrypt_encrypt() in the first place!

I am trying to encrypt a password

This is probably a mistake. The fact that you're calling the key a ""salt"" makes me even more wary. Need to store users' passwords? Encryption is NOT the right tool for the job. Password hashing is. They're wildly different concepts.
But let's ignore the ""wrong tool for the job"" aspect and assume you were encrypting non-password strings for some reason. Even in this scenario, your encryption code is insecure.

return trim ( // Why are you trimming this?
    base64_encode (
        mcrypt_encrypt (
            MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, // Not AES
            $salt,
            $text,
            MCRYPT_MODE_ECB,     // The WORST mode possible
            mcrypt_create_iv (   // ECB mode doesn't use an IV
                mcrypt_get_iv_size (
                    MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB
                ),
                MCRYPT_RAND      // Even if an IV was used, MCRYPT_RAND
                                 // is a bad choice! Use MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM
            )
        )
    )
);


Even if you fixed the issues above, you have a more serious issue: Chosen-ciphertext attacks.
Solution:

For passwords, use the password hashing API
For general-purpose data encryption, use a cryptography library that offers authenticated encryption.

Can you please tell whomever gave you the code snippet that they're spreading insecure code around the internet? Thanks.

","Simple way to solve backward compatibilities is to fill the current password with \0.

To solve it without any impact on application just change to $key = ""1234567890\0\0\0\0\0\0"" (until reaches 16 or 32,...)

Through experimentation I've found that the only place you can set the encrypt.key property is an ENCRYPT_KEY environment variable, a system property, bootstrap.properties, bootstrap.yml, or calling the /key endpoint.

","Draw a large circle on a large sheet of paper.  Write all the integers from 0 to MAXINT clockwise from the top of the circle, equally spaced.  Write all the integers from 0 to MININT anti-clockwise, equally spaced again.  Observe that MININT is next to MAXINT at the bottom of the circle.  Now make a duplicate of this figure on both sides of a piece of stiff card.  Pin the stiff card to the circle through the centres of both.  Pick an angle of rotation, any angle you like.  Now you have a 1-1 mapping which meets some of your requirements, but is probably not obscure enough.  Unpin the card, flip it around a diameter, any diameter.  Repeat these steps (in any order) until you have a bijection you are happy with.
If you have been following closely it shouldn't be difficult to program this in your preferred language.
For Clarification following the comment: If you only rotate the card against the paper then the method is as simple as you complain.  However, when you flip the card over the mapping is not equivalent to (x+m) mod MAXINT for any m.  For example, if you leave the card unrotated and flip it around the diameter through 0 (which is at the top of the clock face) then 1 is mapped to -1, 2 to -2, and so forth.  (x+m) mod MAXINT corresponds to rotations of the card only.

","Can you use a random generated lookup-table? As long as the random numbers in the table are unique, you get a bijective mapping. It's not symmetric, though.
One 16 GB lookup-table for all 32 bit values is probably not practical, but you could use two separate 16-bit lookup tables for the high-word and the low word.
PS: I think you can generate a symmetric bijective lookup table, if that's important. The algorithm would start with an empty LUT:
+----+        +----+
|  1 |   ->   |    |
+----+        +----+
|  2 |   ->   |    |

|  3 |   ->   |    |
+----+        +----+
|  4 |   ->   |    |
+----+        +----+

Pick the first element, assign it a random mapping. To make the mapping symmetric, assign the inverse, too:
+----+        +----+
|  1 |   ->   |  3 |
+----+        +----+
|  2 |   ->   |    |
+----+        +----+
|  3 |   ->   |  1 |
+----+        +----+
|  4 |   ->   |    |
+----+        +----+

Pick the next number, again assign a random mapping, but pick a number that's not been assigned yet. (i.e. in this case, don't pick 1 or 3). Repeat until the LUT is complete. This should generate a random bijective symmetric mapping.

","I will try to explain my solution to this on a much simpler example, which then can be easily extended for your large one.
Say i have a 4 bit number. There are 16 distinct values. Look at it as if it was a four dimensional cube: 
(source: ams.org)
.
Every vertex represents one of those numbers, every bit represents one dimension. So its basicaly XYZW, where each of the dimensions can have only values 0 or 1. Now imagine you use a different order of dimensions. For example XZYW. Each of the vertices now changed its number! 
You can do this for any number of dimensions, just permute those dimensions. If security is not your concern this could be a nice fast solution for you. On the other hand, i dont know if the output will be ""obscure"" enough for your needs and certainly after a large amount of mapping done, the mapping can be reversed (which may be an advantage or disadvantage, depending on your needs.)

","Use any 32-bit block cipher! By definition, a block cipher maps every possible input value in its range to a unique output value, in a reversible fashion, and by design, it's difficult to determine what any given value will map to without the key. Simply pick a key, keep it secret if security or obscurity is important, and use the cipher as your transformation.
For an extension of this idea to non-power-of-2 ranges, see my post on Secure Permutations with Block Ciphers.
Addressing your specific concerns:

The algorithm is indeed symmetric. I'm not sure what you mean by ""reverse the operation without a keypair"". If you don't want to use a key, hardcode a randomly generated one and consider it part of the algorithm.
Yup - by definition, a block cipher is bijective.
Yup. It wouldn't be a good cipher if that were not the case.

","Here is my simple idea:
You can move around the bits of the number, as PeterK proposed, but you can have a different permutation of bits for each number, and still be able to decipher it.
The cipher goes like this:
Treat the input number as an array of bits I[0..31], and the output as O[0..31].
Prepare an array K[0..63] of 64 randomly generated numbers. This will be your key.
Take the bit of input number from position determined by the first random number (I[K[0] mod 32]) and place it at the beginning of your result (O[0]). Now to decide which bit to place at O[1], use the previously used bit. If it is 0, use K[1] to generate position in I from which to take, it it is 1, use K[2] (which simply means skip one random number). 
Now this will not work well, as you may take the same bit twice. In order to avoid it, renumber the bits after each iteration, omitting the used bits. To generate the position from which to take O[1] use I[K[p] mod 31], where p is 1 or 2, depending on the bit O[0], as there are 31 bits left, numbered from 0 to 30.
To illustrate this, I'll give an example:
We have a 4-bit number, and 8 random numbers: 25, 5, 28, 19, 14, 20, 0, 18.
I: 0111    O: ____
    _

25 mod 4 = 1, so we'll take bit whose position is 1 (counting from 0)
I: 0_11    O: 1___
     _

We've just taken a bit of value 1, so we skip one random number and use 28. There are 3 bits left, so to count position we take 28 mod 3 = 1. We take the first (counting from 0) of the remaining bits:
I: 0__1    O: 11__
   _

Again we skip one number, and take 14. 14 mod 2 = 0, so we take the 0th bit:
I: ___1    O: 110_
      _

Now it doesn't matter, but the previous bit was 0, so we take 20. 20 mod 1 = 0:
I: ____    O: 1101

And this is it.
Deciphering such a number is easy, one just has to do the same things. The position at which to place the first bit of the code is known from the key, the next positions are determined by the previously inserted bits.
This obviously has all the disadvantages of anything which just moves the bits around (for example 0 becomes 0, and MAXINT becomes MAXINT), but is seems harder to find how someone has encrypted the number without knowing the key, which has to be secret.

","Split the number in two (16 most significant bits and 16 least significant bits) and consider the bits in the two 16-bit results as cards in two decks. Mix the decks forcing one into the other.
So if your initial number is b31,b30,...,b1,b0 you end up with b15,b31,b14,b30,...,b1,b17,b0,b16. It's fast and quick to implement, as is the inverse.
If you look at the decimal representation of the results, the series looks pretty obscure.
You can manually map 0 -> maxvalue and maxvalue -> 0 to avoid them mapping onto themselves.

","If you don't want to use proper cryptographic algorithms (perhaps for performance and complexity reasons) you can instead use a simpler cipher like the Vigenère cipher. This cipher was actually described as le chiffre indéchiffrable (French for 'the unbreakable cipher').
Here is a simple C# implementation that shifts values based on a corresponding key value:
void Main()
{
  var clearText = Enumerable.Range(0, 10);
  var key = new[] { 10, 20, Int32.MaxValue };
  var cipherText = Encode(clearText, key);
  var clearText2 = Decode(cipherText, key);
}

IEnumerable<Int32> Encode(IEnumerable<Int32> clearText, IList<Int32> key) {
  return clearText.Select((i, n) => unchecked(i + key[n%key.Count]));
}

IEnumerable<Int32> Decode(IEnumerable<Int32> cipherText, IList<Int32> key) {
  return cipherText.Select((i, n) => unchecked(i - key[n%key.Count]));
}

This algorithm does not create a big shift in the output when the input is changed slightly. However, you can use another bijective operation instead of addition to achieve that.

","If your goal is simply to get a seemingly random permutation of numbers of a roughly defined size, then there is another possible way: reduce the set of numbers to a prime number.
Then you can use a mapping of the form
f(i) = (i * a + b) % p
and if p is indeed a prime, this will be a bijection for all a != 0 and all b. It will look fairly random for larger a and b.
For example, in my case for which I stumbled on this question, I used 1073741789 as a prime for the range of numbers smaller than 1 << 30. That makes me lose only 35 numbers, which is fine in my case.
My encoding is then
((n + 173741789) * 507371178) % 1073741789

and the decoding is
(n * 233233408 + 1073741789 - 173741789) % 1073741789

Note that 507371178 * 233233408 % 1073741789 == 1, so those two numbers are inverse the field of numbers modulo 1073741789 (you can figure out inverse numbers in such fields with the extended euclidean algorithm).
I chose a and b fairly arbitrarily, I merely made sure they are roughly half the size of p.

I'm reading a text file, where I store each line of text containing a name and random string of 40 characters exactly, into 2 buffers, char buffer1[128] and char buffer2[128] using fscanf() which people seem to dislike, and later I need to take JUST the string (without any padding or empty space in the rest of the buffer) and encrypt it using AES-CBC-128 and then later on decrypt it. I use md5 on the names to generate a key of 16 bytes which I use in the encryption process and a random initialization vector 16 bytes again. Now, the encryption/decryption works fine almost if I type in the string of 40 chars myself into the AES encrypt function (i.e. the string is decrypted later correctly but there's a few extra gibberish characters appearing beforehand), but if I pass the buffer containing the string into the function, the decryption comes out ALL with gibberish characters (in other words it does not work). If I try to make the buffer small enough to contain the string exactly (char buffer[40]), the encryption/decryption doesn't work. If I try to make it char buffer[41] for the terminator in strings in C, I get a Core Dump error.

I just call alice() from main to test this.
","I managed to figure out my grave mistake. The line:
AES_set_encrypt_key(k_j, sizeof(k_j), &enc_key);

should be:
AES_set_encrypt_key(k_j, sizeof(k_j)*8, &enc_key);

Also the enclength and declength in the AES_CBC_Encrypt() function should be the same apparently. So I used 48bytes for both encryption and decryption, otherwise it didn't work for me. I could be wrong but when I used strlen(buffer2) for encryption (which is 40bytes) the decryption only managed to decrypt part of the string correctly, the rest of it was still gibberish characters. –  val37

"27558625","How do I use AES_CBC_Encrypt 128 openssl properly in Ubuntu?","Still finding it hard to work with memory in C. I'm reading a text file, where I store each line of text containing a name and random string of 40 characters exactly, into 2 buffers, char buffer1[128] and char buffer2[128] using fscanf() which people seem to dislike, and later I need to take JUST the string (without any padding or empty space in the rest of the buffer) and encrypt it using AES-CBC-128 and then later on decrypt it. I use md5 on the names to generate a key of 16 bytes which I use in the encryption process and a random initialization vector 16 bytes again. Now, the encryption/decryption works fine almost if I type in the string of 40 chars myself into the AES encrypt function (i.e. the string is decrypted later correctly but there's a few extra gibberish characters appearing beforehand), but if I pass the buffer containing the string into the function, the decryption comes out ALL with gibberish characters (in other words it does not work). If I try to make the buffer small enough to contain the string exactly (char buffer[40]), the encryption/decryption doesn't work. If I try to make it char buffer[41] for the terminator in strings in C, I get a Core Dump error.
I'm still a C noob and can't figure out what I am doing wrong!
N.B. If I use 48 bytes for the encryption length (multiple of AES BLOCK SIZE which is 16 bytes), it DOES NOT WORK. When I use 40 bytes for encryption length (same as the data to be encrypted) it almost works like I said above. Please explain how I can use AES_CBC_Encrypt PROPERLY ONCE AND FOR ALL!

I just call alice() from main to test this.
","I struggled with that bad documented API of OpenSSL myself. It really doesn't help that the functions itself are implemented in Assembler, so even the sources are not helping. But I was able to identify some mistakes you've made:

As you've stated, AES_set_encrypt_key takes bit-size as second parameter, not bytes.
The key must be exactly of sizes 16, 24, or 32 bytes.
The given init_vector must be the same at start of encryption and decryption.

Because of 2. your whole example won't work with sha1. MD5_DIGEST_LENGTH and has 16 bytes (128 bit) just by coincidence. The initialization vector also gets changed by the encryption operation, so you could add additional data to the block chain again and again. But since you were not following 3. and used the changed vector for decryption without resetting it first, that's why your decryption returns ""gibberish characters"".
As an example I took your code, threw out anything unnecessary, and extracted the encrypt/decrypt operations for clearing up the important parts:
void encrypt(unsigned char* buf, size_t length, const AES_KEY* const enc_key, const unsigned char* iv)
{
  unsigned char local_vector[AES_BLOCK_SIZE];
  memcpy(local_vector, iv, AES_BLOCK_SIZE);

  AES_cbc_encrypt(buf, buf, length, enc_key, local_vector, AES_ENCRYPT);
}

I'm working on buf for reading and writing. As you can see the init_vector gets copied locally to keep the original constant. I did the similar for decryption.
void decrypt(unsigned char* buf, size_t length, const AES_KEY* const dec_key, const unsigned char* iv)
{
  unsigned char local_vector[AES_BLOCK_SIZE];
  memcpy(local_vector, iv, AES_BLOCK_SIZE);

  AES_cbc_encrypt(buf, buf, length, dec_key, local_vector, AES_DECRYPT);
}

And here is what I did with your code. I haven't changed fscanf, because we should focus on the asked problem instead of confusing people:
void tst_function()
{
  FILE *fp=fopen(""alice.txt"",""r""); //read mode
  char buffer1[128], buffer2[128]; //buffer1->names, buffer2->data
  memset(buffer1, 0, sizeof(buffer1));
  memset(buffer2, 0, sizeof(buffer2));
  // remember, this won't work with any other size
  unsigned char k_j[AES_BLOCK_SIZE];

  //until end of file
  while(fscanf(fp,""%s %s\n"",(char*)&buffer1, (char*)&buffer2) > 0)
  {
     printf(""Reading %s %40s\n"", buffer1, buffer2);
     printf(""original:\t%s\n"", buffer2);

     unsigned char init_vector[AES_BLOCK_SIZE];
     RAND_bytes(init_vector, AES_BLOCK_SIZE);

     // PKCS 5 Padding
     // ((inputs_length + AES_BLOCK_SIZE) / AES_BLOCK_SIZE) * AES_BLOCK_SIZE;
     const size_t encslength = 48;
     unsigned char enc_out[encslength];
     memset(enc_out, 0, sizeof(enc_out));
     strncpy(enc_out, buffer2, sizeof(enc_out));

     AES_KEY enc_key, dec_key;
     AES_set_encrypt_key(k_j, sizeof(k_j)*8, &enc_key);
     AES_set_decrypt_key(k_j, sizeof(k_j)*8, &dec_key);

     encrypt(enc_out, encslength, &enc_key, init_vector); //see above
     printf(""encrypted:\t%s\n"", (char*)enc_out);

     decrypt(enc_out, encslength, &dec_key, init_vector); //see above
     printf(""decrpyted:\t%s\n"", (char*)enc_out);
   }
   fclose(fp);
}

It now does what one would expect it to do. You have to be extremely careful about the key size. I crashed a lot because of dangling zeros (from strings) I wasn't aware of. Additionally you could take a look into EVP Symmetric Encryption and Decryption and XTS for keys up to 512 bit.

","There are several things you can do inside a procedure but can't do inside a function. Based on Ben Cull's blog, you can get around this limitation by creating a procedure that handles opening the keys and call that before using the function.
The procedure:
CREATE PROCEDURE OpenKeys

BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;

    BEGIN TRY
        OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY MyKEY

Many Thanks in advance
","Probably you have solved this already but I'll just put my answer for others who faces similar issue. 
Error occurs due to the additional information present in the input array. In public byte[] Encrypt(byte[] input) method you are writing IV length and IV before the ciphered data is written. Lines: 
ms.Write(BitConverter.GetBytes(AESManaged.IV.Length), 0, sizeof(int));
ms.Write(AESManaged.IV, 0, AESManaged.IV.Length);

In public byte[] Decrypt(byte[] input) method you are reading this information and using read IV as initialization vector for AES algorithm. All fine. Then you are constructing CryptoStream with CryptoStreamMode.Write and passing MemoryStream object ms which gets decrypted data. However the passed input array contains not only the encrypted message but also the IV that you wrote during the encryption process. That is why it fails to decrypt.
What you need to do to overcome this is either extract only cipher data from the input array and pass it to: cs.Write(cipherData, 0, cipherData.Length); or change mode into CryptoStreamMode.Read and use cs.Read(outputBuff, 0, outputBuff.Length);.
Also don't use the same MemoryStream object to read and write to because you'll have some garbage in it after CryptoStream will write in it.

As I understand, the JAVA example uses AESEngine for encryption/decryption operations. What is the difference between AESEngine and AESFastEngine and AESLightEngine? Unfortunately I don't understand the information given in the documentation: http://www.bouncycastle.org/docs/docs1.6/index.html
I want to use a new encryption-key for every file I encrypt. Which block cipher modes of operation should I use: AES.CBC, AES.CFB, AES.ECB OR AES.OFB http://www.bouncycastle.org/docs/docs1.6/index.html
Is my assumption correct that in my case I don't have to use an iv / salt (which means I have to use a static iv?) since I use AES.KeyGen128() for key generation and use it only once?
http://www.bouncycastle.org/docs/docs1.6/index.html

Hope my questions do not cause too much confusion ;-) I but I appreciate every answer, clarification or feedback you can give me.

","
My reading of the doc says that the AESEngine, FastEngine and LightEngine all take different tradeoffs of memory versus speed.  You would have to test it yourself to determine if those tradeoffs are even relevant in your scenario. 
you will need to read up on the various AES modes. Different modes have different strengths and attributes, which may be more or less applicable or desirable depending on your scenario.  So the answer to your question is ""it depends."" 
no. you will need an IV.  As far as the salt, it is usually employed with the passphrase to generate the actual encryption key and the IV, often via PKBDF2.  That is outside the realm of AES, but it is a typical usage.  


Finally you didn't ask, but.... why are you porting that code to C#?  .NET has AES encryption built-in.  You don't need to port anything, you can just use the .NET base class library.  Just ensure you use the same keysize and mode, and make sure your key+iv is the same on each side, and the .NET BCL AES classes will interoperate with the BouncyCastle stuff for J2ME.

","To have your exact string after decryption you have to base64 decode Decrypted Data and then create NSString using NSUTF8StringEncoding.
    NSString decryptedString = [[NSString alloc]initWithData:decryptedData];

    NSData *data = [NSData dataByBase64DecodingString:decryptedString];

    decryptedString = [data dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StrinEncoding];

decryptedString hold the string as the same before encryption.

","Addressing the question you commented in the previous answer, the initWithData:encoding: function will return nil because the encrypted data is very unlikely to match up with NSUTF8StringEncoding, given the fact that it is encrypted.
Same question with thorough answer: Why does my initWithData return nil indicating an error after converting NSData to NSString returning from encrypting via CommonCrypto? though as an aside, base64 does not make your encrypted data a visible string, but rather alters it further to make a displayable ASCII string.  This string shouldn't be assumed to be the same as the encrypted data nor the same as encrypting the data, but for use as a string, such as in a keychain, it works just fine.

I am doing data encryption in SQL Server 2005 using a DB Master Key, Certificate and Symmetric Key. I need to be able to restore a certificate with a private key. But when I run the CREATE CERTIFICATE with PRIVATE KEY, the certificate gets pulled into the DB but the private key does not show up. Below are the steps I follow for testing.
Create the Database Master Key. 
 CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '12345'

Create the Certificate
CREATE CERTIFICATE MyCert 
WITH SUBJECT = 'My First Certificate', 
EXPIRY_DATE = '1/1/2199';

Create a symmetric key that is encrypted with MyCert.
CREATE SYMMETRIC KEY MySymmetricKey 
WITH ALGORITHM = AES_256 
ENCRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE MyCert

Call below select statements to show the keys and certs are there.
They are. Master DB Key, Symmetric Key and Certificate are all there.
SELECT * FROM sys.symmetric_keys 

SELECT * FROM sys.certificates 

Create a backup of the database certificate and key
Note I have tried putting them in the same folder and that did not work either.
BACKUP CERTIFICATE MyCert TO FILE = 'C:\SQLDatabase\MyCert\MyCert.cert'
WITH PRIVATE KEY ( FILE = 'C:\SQLDatabase\MyKey\MySymmetricKey.key' ,
ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '12345' )

Drop the key and cert and verify they are gone.
DROP SYMMETRIC KEY MySymmetricKey
DROP CERTIFICATE MyCert;

There is no RESTORE for certificates only create by file. I call
create certificate with the WITH PRIVATE KEY.
When I run this the certificate shows up but the key does not come with it.
I have verified they are in the folders and SQL has access to the folders.
I have also tried the ALTER CERTIFICATE WITH PRIVATE KEY and still nothing.
What am I missing?
CREATE CERTIFICATE PayGoDBCert

SELECT * FROM sys.symmetric_keys 
SELECT * FROM sys.certificates 

","In your example you drop the symmetric keys but don't recreate it again. 
Recreate the symmetric key again then restore the certificate. 
Just a note:The password used to protect the backed up certificate is not the same password that is used to encrypt the private key of the certificate.

I want the encryption type of be AES with a 128 bit key (higher if possible).
The encryption key will also need to be configurable, so my issue might be related to how I padded the strings.

","Checksums are exactly for this purpose. Get a hash of your data before encrypting. Encrypt the data and put it along with the hash into storage. After decrypting, get the hash of the decrypted data and compare it with the former. If you use a crypto grade hash (i.e. SHA512) your data will be safe. After all, this is exactly what encrypted compression software does.
For ultimate security, you can encrypt both the hashes and data separately then decrypt and compare. If both data and hash decrypts to corrupted data, there is very minuscule chances that they will match.

","Though I can agree somewhat with Teoman Soygul post about CRC/Hash there is one very important thing to note.  Never encrypt the hash as this can make it easier to find the resulting key.  Even without encrypting the hash you still gave them an easy way to test if they have successfully gained the correct password; however, let's assume that is already possible.

","HMAC is what you need. It is exactly made for this purpose. It combines the key and the message (which in this case, will be your password) and hashes them in a way that it will ensure the authenticity and integrity of the content, as long as the hash function used is secure. You can attach the HMAC to the encrypted data, and it can be used later to validate if the decryption was made correctly.

","I like Can Gencer's answer; you cannot really verify a decryption without the HMAC. 
But, if you have a very a very large plaintext, then the decrypting can be very expensive. You might do a ton of work just to find out that the password was invalid. It would be nice to be able to do a quick rejection of wrong passwords, without going through all that work.  There is a way using the PKCS#5 PBKDF2. (standardized in RFC2898, which is accessible to your c# program in Rfc2898DeriveBytes).  
Normally the data protocol calls for generation of the key from a password and salt using PBKDF2, at 1000 cycles or some specified number. Then maybe also (optionally) the initialization vector, via a contniuation of the same algorithm.  
To implement the quick password check, generate two more bytes via the PBKDF2. If you don't generate and use an IV, then just generate 32 bytes and keep the last 2.  Store or transmit this pair of bytes adjacent to your cryptotext.  On the decrypting side, get the password, generate the key and (maybe throwaway) IV, then generate the 2 additional bytes, and check them against the stored data.  If the pairs don't match you know you have a wrong password, without any decryption. 
If they match, it is not a guarantee that the password is correct. You still need the HMAC of the full plaintext for that. But you can save yourself a ton of work, and maybe wall clock time, in most cases of ""wrong password"", and without compromising the security of the overall system. 

ps:  you wrote:

Avoid putting plaintext into the cryptotext. It only exposes another attack vector, makes it easier for an attacker to eliminate wrong turns.  The password verification thing I mentioned above is a different animal, does not expose this risk.

My question now is, is there an efficient way to search encrypted data aside from storing a searchable hashed version of the data? E.g., Two columns per data: first_name_encrypted, first_name_hashed.
$hashed_search = myhash('John');    
$q = ""SELECT * FROM table WHERE first_name_hashed = '$hashed_search'"";

This is what I do now, is there a better way?
","Generally you shouldn't be encrypting data stored in a database that you need to search over.
In your example you give, it would be helpful to know the context of why you are grabbing a user by first name, and what your overall security concerns are...
$hashed_search = myhash('John');    
$q = 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE first_name_hashed = '.$hashed_search;

Is this a web app and your main concern is unencrypted transmission of a user's personal info over the network? Use an encrypted connection when sending data between the user's PC and the server (e.g. 'https').
Is your concern someone hacking the server and downloading a copy of the database? Consider limiting the amount of personally identifying info you are storing. Do you really need to store a user's real name?
Assuming you DO need to store personally identifying information about a user, consider using other methods to fetch their records from the database than using the personally identifying parts (i.e. don't grab them by 'first_name'). Consider grabbing a user by ID or by a Username that can be unrelated to their real names. This will allow you to make use of Indexing for fast retrieval of records and you can encrypt their personal info (first name, last name, email, phone #, etc) to your heart's content. 
If this doesn't help you, maybe provide some more context about what you're trying to accomplish and why.
TLDR: Trying to search over encrypted data is a bad idea. Think of what problem you're trying to avoid and come up with an alternate solution.

Close, but no cigar. See: How to search encrypted information with a blind index.
One example, using an authenticated encryption library instead of just using MySQL's built-in AES_*() features:
$first_name_hash = hash_hmac('sha256', $firstName, $secretKey);
$stmt = $db->prepare('SELECT * FROM table WHERE first_name_idx = ?');
$result = $db->execute([$first_name_hash])
    ->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
if ($result) {
    $first_name = Crypto::decrypt($result['first_name_encrypted'], $otherSecretKey);
}

A blind index based on HMAC-SHA256 is preferable to a simple hash.
Also: Use authenticated encryption. This is not negotiable.

"2585746","Securely Storing Optional Entropy While Using DPAPI","So I am trying to store the symmetric key using DPAPI. All is well and great, but what to do with the entropy? This answered question here really doesn't provide enough insight. It seems like a slippery slope - I could use the machine store to store the entropy but then what prevents someone from getting at that as well? Note: I am storing the current key using the User Scope.
So my question is - what is the best way to store the entropy using DPAPI?
","Anything you store locally can be compromised.  But there are steps you can take to make it more difficult.  There is a document on Handling Passwords that you may consider looking over.  You consider your Entropy Key a password specific to your application.  
I am going to refer to your Entropy as your Key, since it is functionally an additional key.
What you don't want to do is store your key locally in an unencrypted format.  Instead you want to either encrypt your key, or derive it from another, in-obvious source.  Of course if your encrypt the key, then you need to store the key used to encrypt it - but often times this single layer of indirection is enough to discourage most challengers.
That would be the advantage of deriving your key.  You could derive it as a hash of some other piece of constant data (needs to be something that doesn't change with revisions of your application).  One trick when deriving a hash though is to combine the hash with some other constant value (like a GUID or large random number) so that someone else cannot just combine a known hash algorithm and get your key.  This is a much better alternative to creating your own hash algorithm (which you should never do, unless you have a PHD in Mathematics).
At some point your are going to need some sort of key hard coded in your application.  This key is either combined with some other data in a hash to create your Entropy Key, or used to decrypt the entropy key.  You actually can have the key change with a new revision of your application, as long as you keep the old key for decrypting the existing key.  Then you can re-encrypt it with the new key or method.
If you want the best security then you can store the Entropy key off the computer.  This would require an internet connection and an SSL certificate, but then they key is never persisted anywhere locally to be discovered.  To do this you can setup a more robust challenge response system so the request authentication is different each time, and the key is delivered over SSL encryption so it cannot be intercepted.  Once the key is used, then it is discarded.  Of course this kind of defeats the purpose of many scenarios where you are using DPAPI for local secure storage.
Whatever you do, keep in mind it will be compromised - that always happens when someone has full access to the local machine and the data stored on it.  The solution to that is to keep releasing updates that change the method enough that the old crack no longer works.  This will make distribution of a crack less valuable as it will be difficult to find one for the right version.

Note: I am storing the current key using the User Scope.
So my question is - what is the best way to store the entropy using DPAPI?
","First, let me address the original post question. It boils down to the fact that the entropy must be stored under the authority of the user and/or the authority of the application if it is going to be used for persisted storage. I suppose you could use a key stored with the application to encrypt the information in the persisted store but again a malicious application would be able to access this encryption key. So, I do not feel there is a means to protect against the scenario you mention in comments. However, given what you have said is the intended use of the entropy, I do not feel it helps in solving your problem.
It sounds as if the actual problem is establishing a secure channel of communication between your client application and the server. In your design, you are exchanging keys that will be used to encrypt communication. I think that trying to use custom code to solve this issue will lead to additional security vulnerabilities.
Given all of that, I would suggest creating a WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) service that is used to retrieve sensitive information. It could obviously be used to retrieve all information, but the least amount of change would be to confine the service to sensitive information.
With WCF, you can configure both the client and the server to use a secure channel. WCF has plenty of options for establishing a secure channel of communication to the server.
<wsHttpBinding>
    <binding>
        <security mode=""Transport"">
            <transport clientCredentialType=""Windows"" />
        </security>
    </binding>
</wsHttpBinding>

Once you have a secure channel, many of the other problems are simpler such as access to the CC data. If that data is sent down a secure channel, it becomes an issue of authorization instead of channel security.
See How to: Create a Secure Session for more.

UPDATE (19-Nov-2014): A useful link has come to light through another question on this topic.
https://www.sagepaylabs.com/AES.zip
The file contains Classic ASP example of how to implement AES (128-bit) using a modified version of the AES Rijndael Block Cipher originally written by Phil Fresle (2001) but has been modified by Mat Peck at Sage Pay to run with 128-bit blocks (AES) with CBC and PKCS#5 padding.
The Classic ASP example contains two files

  includes.asp
  rijndael.asp



The Sage Pay Form Integration requirement is very specific.

From Form integration protocol and guidelines
A1.1 The Crypt Field

The Crypt field should contain all the other transaction information (see the next section) in plain text as Name=Value fields 
  separated by ‘&’ characters. Ensure that all mandatory fields are present and that there are no spaces after the ‘&’ character.
This string should then be encrypted using AES(block size 128-bit) in CBC mode with PKCS#5 padding using the provided 
  password as both the key and initialisation vector and encode the result in hex (making sure the letters are in upper case).
Prepend the @ sign to the beginning of the encoded result.

NB : To decrypt use the same procedure in decryption mode, making sure you remove the @ sign before doing so.

Example Crypt Field

Taking into consideration these requirements means your limited on the options available in a Classic ASP environment.
I would recommend on looking at using AspEncrypt by Persit Software or the only other promising option I can find is (Classic ASP) AES Encryption but as I have not used either of these components I cannot vouch for how good or bad they are.

However I have used Persit components before during web development using Classic ASP and can say that they have always worked for me so my recommendation would be to have a look and see what you think.
It does seem to support the needed requirement, here is an example based on code from the documentation manipulated to suit.
<%
Dim CM, Context, Key, Blob, Crypt

Set CM = Server.CreateObject(""Persits.CryptoManager"")
'AES requires the Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider.
'Set Context = CM.OpenContext("""", True )
Set Context = CM.OpenContextEx( _
  ""Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider"", """", True _
)
Set Blob = CM.CreateBlob
Blob.Hex = ""Hex Encoded Key given to you by Sage Pay"" 'AES-128 Bit Key
'Might need to reverse the bytes which is why the third parameter is set to True.
Set Key = Context.ImportRawKey(Blob, calgAES128, True)

'Make sure padding is set to PKCS#5 and Cipher Mode is set to CBC
'these don't actually need defining because they are the defaults
'according to the documentation, just here for completeness.
Key.Padding = ccpPKCS5
Key.Mode = ccmCBC
Set Blob = Key.EncryptText(""your key value pairs"")

A C# client that lets a user encrypt their data with a simple password when sending to the server, and decrypt with the same password when receiving
A JavaScript client that does the same and therefore must be compatible with the C# client's encryption method

Looking at various JavaScript libraries, I came across SJCL, which has a lovely demo page here: http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.com/sjcl/demo/
From this, it seems that what a client needs to know (besides the password used) in order to decrypt the ciphertext is:

The initialization vector
Any salt used on the password
The key size
Authentication strength (I'm not totally sure what this is)

Is it relatively safe to keep all of this data with the ciphertext?  Keep in mind that this is an open source codebase, and there is no way I can reasonably hide these variables unless I ask the user to remember them (yeah, right).
Any advice appreciated.
","Initialization vectors and salts are called such, and not keys, precisely because they need not be kept secret. It is safe, and customary, to encode such data along with the encrypted/hashed element.
What an IV or salt needs is to be used only once with a given key or password. For some algorithms (e.g. CBC encryption) there may be some additional requirements, fulfilled by chosing the IV randomly, with uniform probability and a cryptographically strong random number generator. However, confidentiality is not a needed property for an IV or salt.
Symmetric encryption is rarely enough to provide security; by itself, encryption protects against passive attacks, where the attacker observes but does not interfere. To protect against active attacks, you also need some kind of authentication. SJCL uses CCM or OCB2 encryption modes which combine encryption and authentication, so that's fine. The ""authentication strength"" is the length (in bits) of a field dedicated to authentication within the encrypted text; a strength of ""64 bits"" means that an attacker trying to alter a message has a maximum probability of 2-64 to succeed in doing so without being detected by the authentication mechanism (and he cannot know whether he has succeeded without trying, i.e. having the altered message sent to someone who knows the key/password). That's enough for most purposes. A larger authentication strength implies a larger ciphertext, by (roughly) the same amount.
I have not looked at the implementation, but from the documentation it seems that the SJCL authors know their trade, and did things properly. I recommend using it.
Remember the usual caveats of passwords and Javascript:

Javascript is code which runs on the client side but is downloaded from the server. This requires that the download be integrity-protected in some way; otherwise, an attacker could inject some of his own code, for instance a simple patch which also logs a copy of the password entered by the user somewhere. In practice, this means that the SJCL code should be served across a SSL/TLS session (i.e. HTTPS).
Users are human beings and human beings are bad at choosing passwords. It is a limitation of the human brain. Moreover, computers keep getting more and more powerful while human brains keep getting more or less unchanged. This makes passwords increasingly weak towards dictionary attacks, i.e. exhaustive searches on passwords (the attacker tries to guess the user's password by trying ""probable"" passwords). A ciphertext produced by SJCL can be used in an offline dictionary attack: the attacker can ""try"" passwords on his own computers, without having to check them against your server, and he is limited only by his own computing abilities. SJCL includes some features to make offline dictionary attacks more difficult:

SJCL uses a salt, which prevents cost sharing (usually known as ""precomputed tables"", in particular ""rainbow tables"" which are a special kind of precomputed tables). At least the attacker will have to pay the full price of dictionary search for each attacked password.
SJCL uses the salt repeatedly, by hashing it with the password over and over in order to produce the key. This is what SJCL calls the ""password strengthening factor"". This makes the password-to-key transformation more expensive for the client, but also for the attacker, which is the point. Making the key transformation 1000 times longer means that the user will have to wait, maybe, half a second; but it also multiplies by 1000 the cost for the attacker.

","I see that in .NET you are specyfing IV:

According to the documentation the second byte array is the IV. So you should use the same array in Java.
I think that the bug is here:
cipher.doFinal(Base64.encodeBase64(inputText.getBytes(""ASCII""))); 

You are b64 encoding input before decrypting it.
Try
    byte[] output = cipher.doFinal(inputText.getBytes(""ASCII""));  
    System.out.println(""Encoded Value ..... ""+new String(Base64.encodeBase64(output)));

Additional remarks (regarding your questions in comments):

you need the same iv for Java and .NET 
the constructor for IvParameterSpec takes byte[] as an argument 
In .NET the CreateEncryptor method takes byte[] IV as second argument:

"43188874","AES/CBC/NoPadding and IllegalBlockSizeException - Custom padding handling","UPDATE: I removed another issue in my code to make the question more precise.
I need to encrypt a String with variable length with AES/CBC/NoPadding but I'm getting an IllegalBlockSizeException.
I have to use NoPadding because the input should have the same length as the output even if the decryption fails. 
It shouldn't be possible to determine that it failed.
Before I used AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding without any problem but that is not an option. So my question is:
How do I add a custom padding to get a multiple of 16 byte or what possibly leads to the IllegalBlockSizeException (DATA_NOT_MULTIPLE_OF_BLOCK_LENGTH)? I also read that ciphertext stealing is a way to do so. I would be grateful for an example.

"10907948","String encryption for storing password and subsequently retrieving","I need to store a password as an encrypted string in an XML file, and be able to pull it back out again.  A quick glance through the System.Security.Cryptography Namespace reveals many options, some of which are hashing and some encryption.
This is the first time I have done any kind of string encryption (where the value is pulled back out again), and I was expecting something like this:
string plainTextPassword = ""mypassword"";
string myKey = ""some key that people are unlikely to guess"";
string encryptedPassword = SomeObject.Encrypt(myKey, plainTextPassword);
// ... write encryptedPassword to xml file ...

and 
// ... read encryptedPassword from xml file ...
string decryptedPassword = SomeObject.Decrypt(myKey, encryptedPassword);

But when I look in the namespace there are services that provide hashing in there also, rather than purely encryption.  I also notice that a lot of other questions are more around hashing (or at least one way encryption) and are not particularly concerned with retrieving the strings afterwards.
I definitely want more than just hashing the password.  Where should I start?

Unfortunately the encryption works for me only if the whole file is encrypted at once. I get errors from EVP_EncryptUpdate or strange crashes if I attempt to call it multiple times. I tested the encryption on Windows 7 and Ubuntu Linux with gcc 4.7.2.

EDIT (Wrong Solution)
The feedback that I received made me think in a different direction and I discovered that EVP_EncryptUpdate for size must be called for each block that it being encrypted, not for the total size of the file. I moved it just before the block is encrypted: like this:
for (int i = 0; i < loops; ++i) {
    int buflen;
    (void)EVP_EncryptUpdate(m_ctx, nullptr, &buflen, nullptr, bsize);
    // Resize the output buffer to buflen here
    // ...
    // Encrypt into target buffer
    (void)EVP_EncryptUpdate(m_ctx, out, &len, in, buflen);
    outl += len;
}

AES CCM encryption block by block works this way, but not correctly, because each block is treated as independent message.
EDIT 2
OpenSSL's implementation works properly only if the complete message is encrypted at once.

","Some machines have a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) and some also have a keychain or keystore that leverages the TPM. Macs do as do some Windows machines. Just encryption a key moves the problem to securing the encryption key.
When you get code look to see if it is current, old bad code is rarely removed from the Internet. The MDN code is completely out of date in every respect.
Do not use DES, it is no longer consider secure and 3DES is archaic and not recommended for new work. Instead use AES. DES, 3DES and AES are all symmetric keys.
Do not use MD5, it is no longer considered secure, use at least SHA256 but for password derivation use a method that uses a salt and iteration count such as PBKDF2 (Password Based Derivation Function 2).
Do not use ECB mode, it too is insecure, see ECB mode, scroll down to the Penguin.

","You can have a look at another answer of mine:

Where to store db passwords when using Windows .NET or ASP.NET applications

Or you can consider generating a key from a password, which you can use to encrypt the key itself:

Create a Key from a Password / Random SALT (in C#)

Either way, you should not use DES any longer as it is not secure enough any more. Triple-DES is okay if you have no other option. I recommend to use AES with a key size of 256 bit if you require a secure symmetric algorithm. 

In the former Documentation Beta - ""stackoverflow.com/documentation"", I had added some additional information (.Net Framework -> Encryption / Cryptography). Since Beta is offline, I will provide this information here:

This example is taken from MSDN.
It is a console demo, and it shows how to create a secure key based on a user-defined password, and how to create a random SALT based on the cryptographic random generator.
Notes:

The built-in function PasswordDeriveBytes uses the standard PBKDF1 algorithm to generate a key from the password. Per default, it uses 100 iterations to generate the key to slow down brute force attacks. The SALT generated randomly further strenghens the key.
The function CryptDeriveKey converts the key generated by PasswordDeriveBytes into a key compatible with the specified encryption algorithm (here ""TripleDES"") by using the specified hash algorithm (here ""SHA1""). The keysize in this example is 192 bytes, and the initialization vector IV is taken from the triple-DES crypto provider
Usually, this mechanism is used to protect a stronger random generated key by a password, which encrypts large amount of data. You can also use it to provide multiple passwords of different users to give access to the same data (being protected by a different random key).
Unfortunately, CryptDeriveKey does currently not support AES. See here. 
NOTE: As a workaround, you can create a random AES key for encryption of the data to be protected with AES and store the AES key in a TripleDES-Container which uses the key generated by CryptDeriveKey. But that limits the security to TripleDES, does not take advantage of the larger keysizes of AES and creates a dependency to TripleDES.

Looking for some direction.
","Common sense says, if an intruder gets access to your database, they will most likely also have access to your file system. It really comes down to you. For one, you can try to hide it. In configuration files, in plain files somewhere in file system, encrypt it with another key that is within the application ... and so on and so forth. 
Configuration files are a logical answer, but why take a chance - mix it. Feel free to mix keys with multi-level encryptions - one requiring something from the record itself and being unique to every record, other one requiring a configuration value, third one requiring an application-specific value, and perhaps a fourth one from a library hidden well within your application's references? This way, even if one layer somehow gets compromised, you will have several others protecting it.
Yes, it adds overhead. Yes, it is relatively expensive. But is it worth it if you have sensitive data like user credit card details? You bet it is.
I'm using similar encryption and hashing techniques in one of my personal pet projects that is highly security focused and carefully controlled. It depends how much data you need to display at any one time - for example, mine will ever fetch only 10 records at a time, most likely even less. 
... To specify what I mean by mixing: Encrypt once. Then encrypt that data again with different key and suggestedly different algorithm.

Encrypting and writing works fine, the file appears on the disk and the content is there (encrypted of course). But when I call the retrieve method I always get a SerializationException

Binary stream '30' does not contain a valid BinaryHeader. Possible causes are invalid stream or object version change between serialization and deserialization.

When I leave the cryptographic methods out everything works fine.
","You are close.  However, the stream you pass into the creation of CryptoStream is always, always, always the  buffer that will hold your end result.  It is not the stream that holds the data you want to encrypt or decrypt.  I put the emphasis in there because I remember learning this for the first time and I did exactly what you were doing.  So here:
// this is for encryption
var memStreamEncryptedData = new MemoryStream();
var encryptStream = new CryptoStream(memStreamEncryptedData, 
   transform, CryptoStreamMode.Write);

// this is for decryption
var memStreamDecryptedData = new MemoryStream();
var decryptStream = new CryptoStream(memStreamDecryptedData, 
   transform, CryptoStreamMode.Write);

Notice in both cases, CryptoStream is being initialized with a blank output stream.  Your stream does not enter into the picture until later.  So, during a write, you will do the following:
encryptStream.Write(dataToBeEncrypted);
encryptStream.FlushFinalBlock();
encryptStream.Close();
// memStreamEncryptedData now safely holds your encrypted data

And during the read, you will:
decryptStream.Write(dataToBeDecrypted);
encryptStream.FlushFinalBlock();
encryptStream.Close();
// memStreamDecryptedData now safely holds your decrypted data

So, to save you some trouble, here's a nice simple Symmetric method that will perform both encryption and decryption.  The only difference between this and yours is that I am working directly on byte arrays, but perhaps that augmentation can be an exercise:
public static byte[] Symmetric(bool encrypt, byte[] plaintext, string ikey)
{
    if (plaintext.Length == 0) return plaintext;

    // setting up the services can be very expensive, so I'll cache them
    // into a static dictionary.
    SymmetricSetup setup;
    if (!_dictSymmetricSetup.TryGetValue(ikey, out setup))
    {
        setup = new SymmetricSetup();
        setup.des = new DESCryptoServiceProvider { Mode = CipherMode.CBC, 
            Padding = PaddingMode.Zeros };
        setup.hash = Hash(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(ikey));
        setup.key = setup.hash.ForceLength(8, 0);
        setup.IV = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(""init vec"");
        setup.des.Key = setup.key;
        setup.des.IV = setup.IV;

        setup.encrypt = setup.des.CreateEncryptor(setup.des.Key, setup.des.IV);
        setup.decrypt = setup.des.CreateDecryptor(setup.des.Key, setup.des.IV);
        _dictSymmetricSetup[ikey] = setup;
    }

    var transform = encrypt ? setup.encrypt : setup.decrypt;

    var memStreamEncryptedData = new MemoryStream();

    var encStream = new CryptoStream(memStreamEncryptedData, transform, CryptoStreamMode.Write);

    if (encrypt)
        encStream.Write(new[] {(byte) ((8 - (plaintext.Length + 1)%8)%8)}, 0, 1);

    encStream.Write(plaintext, 0, plaintext.Length);
    encStream.FlushFinalBlock();
    encStream.Close();

    memStreamEncryptedData.Flush();

    var ciphertext = memStreamEncryptedData.ToArray();

    byte b;

    if (!encrypt)
        if (byte.TryParse("""" + ciphertext[0], out b))
            ciphertext = ciphertext.Skip(1).Take(ciphertext.Length - b - 1).ToArray();

    return ciphertext;
}

And to call it, you might do something like this:
static public byte[] DecryptData(this byte[] source, string password) {
    return Symmetric(false, source, password);
}

static public byte[] EncryptData(this byte[] source, string password) {
    return Symmetric(true, source, password);
}

Again, you'll do something slightly different to work with streams, but hopefully you get the gist.  Instead of MemoryStream, it will be whatever stream you need to feed into your serializer.

","So,
You realize that in this code 
private static TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider GetCryptoProvider()
{
    TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider cryptic = new TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider();
    try
    {
        cryptic.Key = ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(CrypKey);

        Rfc2898DeriveBytes db = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(""sdddsdsd"", 8);
        cryptic.IV = db.GetBytes(8);
    }
    catch (Exception)
    {
        throw;
    }
    finally
    {
        cryptic.Dispose(); // <------- Don't do this until you are done decrypting.
    }
    return cryptic;
}

you will ALWAYS dispose of the provider meaning you are always using a random key and iv

How do I encrypt a string in vb.net using RijndaelManaged, and using PKCS5 padding?
Does BinaryFormatter apply any compression?
In later, you can see how I stacked compression with encryption with serialization.  And it works.

EDIT 1: I fixed the final byte array conversion to String in the Java code, as Jon Skeet suggested.
","This is what's wrong, in the Java code:
return Base64.encode(ciphertext.toString());

You're calling toString() on the byte array, which will always give a string such as [B@3e25a5.
EDIT: Ooh, just noticed that you can change the Java side. Hooray.
Basically, you need to use a Base64 API which allows:
return Base64.encode(ciphertext);

I'm always disappointed in Base64 APIs which allow you to ""encode"" a string, to be honest... base64 fundamentally encodes binary data to text, and decodes text data to binary. Oh well...
Anyway, use this API (the encodeBytes method) if you need one which allows you to pass in a byte array.
I haven't checked over the actual encryption part in detail, but the C# code at least looks like it's doing the right thing in terms of encodings. It could do with using statements though :)

Any ideas? Thanks!

Update:
The received encrypted file is consistently 1 byte smaller that the original file which seems to be generating the error. The error re block size is triggered at the code line
 while ((b = fis.read(d)) != -1) { in the decrypt function. 
Update:
Thanks for the feedback. The ultimate solution is as defined at last block incomplete with CipherInputStream/CipherOutputStream, even with padding AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding

"40050674","How to generate a AES-256 CBC key/iv that can be shared as a string?","I am trying to make AES-256 CBC encryption work in PHP, Ruby (using SymmetricEncryption) and Javascript (using CryptoJS). As for the first 2:
<?php
openssl_encrypt(
  'Hello!', 'aes-256-cbc',
  '1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF',
  0,
  '1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF'
); // => 'BAd5fmmMTvRE4Ohvf3GpCw=='

ruby_cipher = SymmetricEncryption::Cipher.new(
  key: ""1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF"",
  iv: ""1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF"",
  cipher_name: 'aes-256-cbc'
)
ruby_cipher.encrypt(""Hello!"") # => 'BAd5fmmMTvRE4Ohvf3GpCw=='

But according to this answer the above key/iv only provide 128 bit security.

PHP and Ruby take the key and IV as a binary string. They don't assume that it is Hex-encoded. So, although this key has 256 bits in it, the security is actually only 128 bits, because each character has only 4 bit in a Hex-encoded string.

So using only half of the key/iv provides the same encryption result in CryptoJS.
CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(
    ""Hello!"",
    CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse('1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF'),
    iv: CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse('1234567890ABCDEF')
).toString() // 'BAd5fmmMTvRE4Ohvf3GpCw=='

How do I generate string key and iv's that provide 256 bit security?
","You use a key generator, and if not available, a random number generator to generate a key of the correct size, in this case 32 bytes. You can feed that to the cipher implementation. Then, if you need hexadecimals then you can convert or encode them explicitly to hexadecimals after.
Of course, to decrypt (or encrypt again) you'd first have to decode or parse the hexadecimal string back to the actual binary key.
Basically you'd use the hexadecimals to represent the bytes or octets, but you never use the hexadecimals directly.

Note that usually hexadecimal strings are not used. I'd only use them to test code. In general keys are put in (PKCS#12) key stores, or they are generated by a key derivation method. Hexadecimals are generally only needed for human consumption and this is generally not required. One reason not to encode to hexadecimals is that strings are sometimes hard to remove from memory, so it may well be that the hexadecimal key remains in memory after use.

","AES Encryption only supports a key-size of 128 bits, 192 bits or 256 bits.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard
You can't just take any byte array and use it as an AES key. In the sample code you see above, the example cleverly used 16 characters, which corresponds to a 128-bit key.
This is because 1 character or rather 1 byte corresponds to 8 bits.
A 16-value byte array will then correspond to 16 * 8 = 128 bits
23 characters = 23 * 8 = 184 bits, thus it is an invalid key-size.
You need either 16 characters, 24 characters, or 32 characters.
That being said, using merely characters for AES encryption is extremely insecure. Do use a proper and secure random key for encrypt purposes.
To generate a secure and random AES key:
SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
byte [] secret = new byte[16];
random.nextBytes(secret);

","Your secret key is most likely a Base64 encoded key (23 chars should decode to about 16 bytes, which is the right length for a 128 bit key for AES).

","128 but AES Encryption supports key key size of 16 bytes.  
16 * 8 = 128 bits, even in the example the key is 16 bytes.
Sounds like your key is in Base64 so use Base64.decode(key or key.getBytes()) to get the byte array, check its in 16 bytes otherwise make it 16 bytes by padding.

","Thank you everyone for your help.  I wanted to post my final solution for others to use.  I am including my entire encryption package code minus the specific password key (again for security).  This code creates the same hex string as the CF code listed in the question, and decrypts it back to the proper english text string.
I found the bytesToHex and  hexStringToByteArray functions in other question on stackoverflow, so my thanks to users maybeWeCouldStealAVan and Dave L. respectively also.  I think I will look into other base 64 encoders/decoders in case the one from sun is ever made unavailable, but this definitely works for now.  Thanks again.

","You are mixing things up. Ssl uses an asymetric key (defined in the certificate) to pass a autogenerated symetric key between the client and the server. This symetric key is then used throughout the secure session (the channel).
So basically, you already have a fast symetric encryption when using ssl. The only asymetric encryption takes place at the very beginning of the communication.
Don't try to manage your symetric keys on your own. It will not work.

No it won't. SSL uses symmetric encryption.

The other option is to transfer a symmetric key on the ssl channel and close the ssl channel once the symmetric key is delivered to the client. 

The client and server already have a symmetric encryption key, as soon as the session is estalbished. This would be merely redundant.
There is no problem here to solve.

Then I found the contrary
Please can you tell me which is true? Thanks
And does anyone know a guide where it is explained step by step the handshake of tls protocol over https?
","The best answer is that it does both. TLS uses asymmetric encryption to first establish identity of one or both parties. Secondly, it uses asymmetric encryption to exchange a key to a symmetric cipher. So asymmetric is only used during the initial setup of communication.
Symmetric encryption which is used through the rest is faster and more efficient with large amounts of data transfer. The keys are smaller which is generally why it's faster, but it's algorithm is also easier to process.
As far as a guide goes, a simple Google search will give you plenty. The one I found from IBM looks decent. They removed some of the excess detail to make it easier to understand.

","as far as I can tell, you are taking the byte array output from the encryption algorithm, and converting it to a hex string using BigInteger.  then the decryption algorithm takes the hex string and converts it to the byte representation of the ASCII characters in the hex string using .toString() 
This is where your code is wrong (among other places).  rather than turning, say, the hex string output ""FFFF"" into a byte array [0xff, 0xff] it turns it into the byte array [0x46,0x46,0x46,0x46] (e.g. the ASCII byte representation of the upper case F).  This means that not only will all of the bytes in your conversion be wrong, the byte array will be the wrong length (which causes the exception you listed in your question).
Instead, you should return byte[] from your encryption method, and accept byte[] as a parameter in your decryption method.  failing that, you should use something like Apache Commons Codec's Hex class to reliably convert between byte arrays and hex strings.

cipher.doFinal(cipherText, cipherTextLength);

I would rewrite it as is:
public String encryptText(String plainText) throws ... {
    byte[] plainTextBytes = plainText.getBytes(""UTF8"");
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, keySpec, ivSpec); 
    byte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(plainTextBytes);
    return toHex(encrypted);
}

public String decryptText(String cipherTextString) throws ... {
    byte[] cipherTextBytes = fromHex(cipherTextString);
    cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, keySpec, ivSpec);
    byte[] plainTextBytes = cipher.doFinal(cipherTextBytes);
    return new String(plainTextBytes, ""UTF8"");

","If you want to encrypt data using a symmetric key encryption, I recommend:
1) Use AES, because it is certified by the NSA for data classified as secret.
2) Use a well reviewed implementation so you don't have to research the proper way to configure the code. For example, AESCrypt.
You can find AESCrypt here: http://www.aescrypt.com/java_aes_crypt.html 
I've seen AESCrypt used in several financial institutions. AESCrypt for java is a single class that calls JCE methods. Android, JCE is implemented by bouncycastle. I have seen bouncycastle used in several major financial institutions.

"10578106","How to avoid AESManaged (C#) ""Length of the data to decrypt is invalid.""","I am using ""AesManaged"" for encryption and decryption of protected data in web application. in my scenario, i am creating a token based on ""Email + CurrentDate"" when user login, and send it in encrypted format back to the user(Encryption is done using AESManaged class), and when user invokes next server side method for example ""Show Report"", the user/client applicaiton will also send that encrypted token with the request. At server side i decrypt the token, and after peforming conditional logic based on decrypted token, it is decided whether the given user have access to this method or not(a kind of authorization check). 
It is behaving fine(as expected) for basic flow with user providing the correct encrypted string which he gets from server or it is of same lenght but user replaces characters in the encrypted string.
However, the problem arises, when user get a string of (for example) 54 character but send only 7 character to server. then following exception occurs.
I want to avoid this exception even if the user provides invalid data. so, basically string should always be decrypted, and if it is invalid token, then i can restrict access to the resource. how can I achieve this? your answer will be appreciated.

"10578106","How to avoid AESManaged (C#) ""Length of the data to decrypt is invalid.""","I am using ""AesManaged"" for encryption and decryption of protected data in web application. in my scenario, i am creating a token based on ""Email + CurrentDate"" when user login, and send it in encrypted format back to the user(Encryption is done using AESManaged class), and when user invokes next server side method for example ""Show Report"", the user/client applicaiton will also send that encrypted token with the request. At server side i decrypt the token, and after peforming conditional logic based on decrypted token, it is decided whether the given user have access to this method or not(a kind of authorization check). 
It is behaving fine(as expected) for basic flow with user providing the correct encrypted string which he gets from server or it is of same lenght but user replaces characters in the encrypted string.
However, the problem arises, when user get a string of (for example) 54 character but send only 7 character to server. then following exception occurs.
I want to avoid this exception even if the user provides invalid data. so, basically string should always be decrypted, and if it is invalid token, then i can restrict access to the resource. how can I achieve this? your answer will be appreciated.

","Yes, more rounds will make the encryption stronger against certain attacks. But you should only store salted, hashed passwords. Don't encrypt them. That way, if someone steals your database they can't decrypt the passwords.

","The short answer is yes.
Think of it like a Rubik's cube (It's not really the best example but bear with me).  The plaintext is the cube in its solved state, the ciphertext its scrambled state.  Each round of encryption is rotating one face of the cube once.  It's computationally much more difficult to solve the cube in the shortest possible number of moves if its more heavily scrambled.  Breaking one round of AES would be the cryptographical equivalent of asking someone to solve a Rubik's cube with one face rotated.
One such attack that can solve reduced rounds of encryptions efficiently is a SAT solver attack.
You should be using one way cryptographic operations for storing passwords anyway.  I believe the preferred method is bcrypting, because it's cryptographically secure (one way) and computationally intensive and thus very difficult to brute force.

If i set it to use a high number of encryption and decryption iterations, say 255, will that really make my password any MORE secure than 1 iteration?
","The short answer is no. Adding iterations of encryption does not help. This is different to adding rounds in the underlying algorithm, where more rounds does, in fact, help.
The longer answer is that you are using the wrong technique for storing passwords. You shouldn't be using symmetric encryption, you should be using a one-way hashing function such as bcrypt.
The weakness in your solution (symmetric encryption) is that the encryption key must be available to your software in order to encrypt or decrypt a password. That means that when an attacker breaks in to your system they will be able to obtain both your password database and the key, so it will be trivial for them to then decrypt all the passwords. You should assume that an attacker will be able to obtain your source code as well as all your data.
If you use a hash function then you don't need to worry about this scenario. Even if an attacker obtains your source code and the password database they still cannot reverse the one-way hash (assuming you use a good hash - again, consider bcrypt), so theft of your data does not compromise your users' passwords.
When you are thinking about security it is almost always best to use an existing solution (did I mention bcrypt?) rather than rolling your own. Security is hard to get right, and even the experts screw it up. Don't write your own password storage system. Use one that was designed by the experts and, more importantly, has been analysed and attacked by a legion of other experts. Bcrypt, for example.

I have a string which is RC4 encrypted, and I need to decrypt it using Objective-C on the iPad (iOS 5.0). I have looked all over the net for a working example, but have had no luck finding an example that works end-to-end. Not only does the code below not return the decrypted string correctly, it returns something different every time it executes, which makes me thing a pointer is being released someplace. 
Note: I do not know if it matters, but the string was encrypted using http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/RC4 and then stored as text in a Sqlite database, which I am now accessing from Objective-C (I know, the architecture sounds messy, but I can't change that at this point.)

I am implementing a file encryption background daemon which is based on the official Golang cipher example:

    inFile, err := os.Open(""encrypted-file"")

    block, err := aes.NewCipher(key)
    if err != nil {

    }

    // If the key is unique for each ciphertext, then it's ok to use a zero
    // IV.
    var iv [aes.BlockSize]byte
    stream := cipher.NewOFB(block, iv[:])

    outFile, err := os.OpenFile(""decrypted-file"", os.O_WRONLY|os.O_CREATE|os.O_TRUNC, 0600)
    if err != nil {

    reader := &cipher.StreamReader{S: stream, R: inFile}
    // Copy the input file to the output file, decrypting as we go.
    if _, err := io.Copy(outFile, reader); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Note that this example is simplistic in that it omits any
    // authentication of the encrypted data. If you were actually to use
    // StreamReader in this manner, an attacker could flip arbitrary bits in
    // the output.
}

func ExampleStreamWriter() {
    key := []byte(""example key 1234"")

    inFile, err := os.Open(""plaintext-file"")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer inFile.Close()

    block, err := aes.NewCipher(key)
    if err != nil {

What is meant with the following quote. About what should I take care to provide a secure encryption and decryption?

Note that this example is simplistic in that it

","From wikipedia:

The block cipher modes ECB, CBC, OFB, CFB, CTR, and XTS provide confidentiality, but they do not protect against accidental modification or malicious tampering. 

A good explanation can be found here: https://security.stackexchange.com/a/33576.
Go has support for other modes which do support integrity and authentication checks. As rossum said you can use GCM or CCM. You can find lots of examples on godoc.org. For example HashiCorp's memberlist library.
Another library worth checking out is the NaCL port in golang.org/x/crypto/nacl:
func Open(out []byte, box []byte, nonce *[24]byte, key *[32]byte) ([]byte, bool)
func Seal(out, message []byte, nonce *[24]byte, key *[32]byte) []byte

If you're working with small messages this API will probably be a lot easier to use.

"5425871","Using Rfc2898DeriveBytes Class to obtain Key and IV","I am just becoming familiar with encryption and the .NET framework. After looking at many examples I am seeing a repeated pattern that confuses when using the .NET Class Rfc2898DeriveBytes. When using this class to obtain an encryption key and an initialization vector the same method seems to be used.
Here is some code from an MSDN blog that demonstrates obtaining a key and an initialization vector.
byte[] salt = new byte[] { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 };
Rfc2898DeriveBytes pwdGen = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(""P@$$w0rd"", salt, 1000);

// generate an RC2 key
byte[] key = pwdGen.GetBytes(16);
byte[] iv = pwdGen.GetBytes(8);

I have seen this used in other places also. I guess I would have thought it would be something like this ...
// generate an RC2 key
byte[] key = pwdGen.GetKey();
byte[] iv = pwdGen.GetInitializationVector();

I MUST be missing something here. If the Key and Initialization Vector (IV) are just random numbers how are they obtained again when using the proper password and salt?
","The RFC2898 key derivation algorithm is deterministic.  When you run it with the same inputs, you'll get the same outputs.
So as long as you call GetBytes() in the same order, requesting the same number of bytes, you'll get the same key and IV.
Don't forget that in a real system the salt should be randomly generated at encryption time (and stored so that it can be retrieved at decryption time).

","I wouldn't use encryption for this task. Anything you encrypt can potentially be decrypted by someone. A better solution is to generate a random code and assign it against the email address in your database. Then do a lookup based on that code. The code could be as simple as using a GUID.
In C#: Guid.NewGuid()

In SQL Server: NEWID()

","I would create a new column in your user email table that is of type UNIQUEIDENTIFIER and set it's default value to NEWID() so that it creates a new GUID (like: 400c4d0d-cd5a-42fd-8660-15250e27c247) when the record is created. This is on the assumption that per email, you create a new record in this table.
SQL to alter your source table:
ALTER TABLE [YOUR_TABLE] ADD
    UniqueEmailId uniqueidentifier NOT NULL 
    CONSTRAINT DF_YOUR_TABLE_UniqueEmailId DEFAULT newid()

You can then use the value created in your hyperlink, like so:
www.yoursite.com/emailid=400c4d0d-cd5a-42fd-8660-15250e27c247

Then once it's clicked, you simply look up the user/email related to that unique identifier and serve your page.
This would circumvent the requirement of passing sensitive information that you have to encrypt/decrypt in hyperlinks.

","Have a read on this link:

Using AES with Java Technology (Could not use the link as normally due to the domain being a number): http://192.9.162.55/developer/technicalArticles/Security/AES/AES_v1.html

By default you can use up to AES 128bit.
In order to use 256 bit AES keys, you must download and install ""Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files"" from here. 
Here is a simple example which encrypts an decrypts a String message in java using AES:
 import java.security.*;
   import javax.crypto.*;
   import javax.crypto.spec.*;
   import java.io.*;

   /**
   * This program generates a AES key, retrieves its raw bytes, and
   * then reinstantiates a AES key from the key bytes.
   * The reinstantiated key is used to initialize a AES cipher for
   * encryption and decryption.
   */

   public class AES {

     /**
     * Turns array of bytes into string
     *
     * @param buf   Array of bytes to convert to hex string
     * @return  Generated hex string
     */
     public static String asHex (byte buf[]) {
      StringBuffer strbuf = new StringBuffer(buf.length * 2);
      int i;

      for (i = 0; i < buf.length; i++) {
       if (((int) buf[i] & 0xff) < 0x10)
        strbuf.append(""0"");

       strbuf.append(Long.toString((int) buf[i] & 0xff, 16));
      }

      return strbuf.toString();
     }

     public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

       String message=""This is just an example"";

       // Get the KeyGenerator

       KeyGenerator kgen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""AES"");
       kgen.init(128); // 192 and 256 bits may not be available


       // Generate the secret key specs.
       SecretKey skey = kgen.generateKey();
       byte[] raw = skey.getEncoded();

       SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(raw, ""AES"");


       // Instantiate the cipher

       Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES"");

       cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, skeySpec);

       byte[] encrypted =
         cipher.doFinal((args.length == 0 ?
          ""This is just an example"" : args[0]).getBytes());
       System.out.println(""encrypted string: "" + asHex(encrypted));

       cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, skeySpec);
       byte[] original =
         cipher.doFinal(encrypted);
       String originalString = new String(original);
       System.out.println(""Original string: "" +
         originalString + "" "" + asHex(original));
     }
   }

The above code will have to be modified in such a way that you read the encrypted files into a StringBuffer/byte array etc, un-encrypt them (in memory only) do the work needed then re-encrypt StringBuffer/data/bytes and write it to file.
Another great Cryptograpic API is:

Bouncy Castle

There are many examples that can be found for Bouncy Castle API too:

","SAML 2.0 utilizes XML Encryption (Sect 5.2.1 and 5.2.2). With that said, Sect 4.2 of the SAML 2.0 Conformance docs specifies you must support the following to be SAML 2.0 compliant:

Block Encryption: TRIPLE DES, AES-128, AES-256.
Key Transport: RSA-v1.5, RSA-OAEP

In other words, SAML 2.0  mandates you use asymmetric keys. 
So, the ""cons"" will be that you are not SAML 2.0 compliant if you utilize symmetric encryption of SAML Attributes which will lead to interopability issues with other SAML 2.0 partners. However, that does not mean that you cannot actually choose to use this type of encryption as long as your partner supports this as well. 
On the ""pros"" side, symmetric encryption is faster (less computationally intensive I'm told) but I'm pretty sure it's not worth the trade-off wrt compliance.

Asymmetric is preferred due to stronger security (larger key sizes, etc.) - and ease of keeping the private keys secure (only the public keys need to be distributed).  However due to its performance it's only used as a means to exchange symmetric keys.  Symmetric encryption on the bulk of the data is done for speed.

He explains the trade-offs in the designs for XML Enc and DSig, and has tips about implementation.  In the 9 years since he wrote it, many conventions have arisen about these trade-offs, which you can find via search.
My colleague, Ian, has listed the SAML 2.0 required algorithms, so you can focus on these in Eastlake's book.  And as you are probably aware, ""required"" in a spec means that if you limit yourself to just these, you will be interoperable.
Finally, this technique Scott describes, of generating a random symmetrical key, encrypting the data with it, and then encrypting the random symmetrical key w/ the public encryption key of your recipient is ofter called digital enveloping and is used everywhere in cryptography, from SSL to key management systems.

"17453750","How do encryption algorithms know if they have the right key","I know it is a bad idea to try to implement your own encryption algorithms. Here is one reason why I think it is not:
For example let's say I want to send plainText = new byte[]{2,5,1,6,7} to bob. 
If I use AES encryption or another well know algorithm then I will have:
cipherText = Aes.Encrypt(plainText, key, iv); // now I have some cipher text that is not readable to anyone if they do not have the key and iv vector.

if someone wants to decrypt that message then they will have to do something like:
newPlainText = Aes.Decrypt(cipherText, key, iv);

Now my question is how does AES knows if you entered the right key? I think it will be more secure to have an algorithm where it is not prompt to brute force attacks. In other words if the hacker knows you used AES it can keep trying a lot of passwords until the method Aes.Decrypt thorws no exception. Now consider this algorithm:
lets say I want to send the same byte array {2,5,1,6,7} to bob. My encryption algorithm may look like:
password is = ""securePassword"";
I will iterate though each byte on my plain text and do the Xor operator on the ASCII value of each character on the password. For instance the first byte will be 2 Xor (ASCII value of 's') then the next value will be 5 Xor  (ASCII value of 'e') at the end I will end up with {2 Xor 's', 5 Xor 'e', 1 Xor 'c', 6 Xor 'u', 7 Xor 'r'} The nice thing about this algorithm is that you will never now if you have the right key!
with this algorithm it is not possible to know if you have the write key which makes it impossible I believe to decipher it. If you use the well know algorithms you are prompt to a brute force attack if your password is not to long. 
*So my question is how does well known symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES knows if you entered the right key? Having an algorithm where you don't know if you supply the right key will not be more secure? *
","The encryption algorithm doesn't know whether the input key is correct or not! The algorithm works just fine decrypting with any key; it'll just end up with garbage if you use the wrong key. The application using the encryption may be able to detect this once it's done, because the decrypted message will probably have invalid padding or will be malformed in other ways, but AES itself will never ""throw an exception"".
The algorithm you're describing is a one-time pad. Its fatal flaw is that its keys must be at least as long as the message, and can never be reused -- if the same key is used with two messages, then the two messages A ⊕ K and B ⊕ K can be XORed together to yield A ⊕ K ⊕ B ⊕ K = A ⊕ B -- the key has now been removed from the messages, and it may be possible to guess what the messages are from this.

*So my question is how does well known symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES knows if you entered the right key? Having an algorithm where you don't know if you supply the right key will not be more secure? *
","First off, the AES algorithm is exactly that. It's just a mathematical cipher. It can't know whether you're using the right key or not. The difference that provides this ability is usually the predefined way that the cipher primitive is combined with the key, IV and one or more ""blocks"" of the plaintext/ciphertext to produce the result; this is known as the cipher mode.
One of the most common modes is CBC, or Cipher Block Chaining. In this mode, the previously encrypted block of ciphertext is XORed with the next block of plaintext before it's run through the cipher (the first block is XORed with the IV). This mode requires the plaintext message length to be an exact multiple of the block size, and this is accomplished with padding.
Padding, combined with the ""chaining"" mode of encryption, provides a checksum of sorts. The last block must be a validly padded block (for messages that happen to be an exact length multiple of the block size, the last block is still padding; it's just all zeroes). If it's not, then either the wrong key was used, or the message was corrupted in transit (the chaining effect of the encryption means that any error introduced into the ciphertext is seen in that block of plaintext and in every later block). This is most likely the source of your exception when using the wrong key. However, CBC has been proven vulnerable to a chosen-ciphertext attack, allowing an attacker to recover the plaintext without knowing the key, if he is allowed to feed specially-modified blocks of ciphertext into a decryption algorithm and view the result.
Other modes have built-in message authentication, which prevents this type of attack. For instance, there's CCM, which is Counter with CBC-MAC. First, the message is hashed by running it through CBC encryption, but keeping only the last block of data (remember that cascading behavior? Turns out it's a great way to calculate a keyed hash). Then, the message and the hash digest are encrypted using Counter mode (the IV is XORed with a sequential value, producing a nonce that is XORed with each block of plaintext). If the wrong key is used, or the message has changed in transit, then the resulting message, when re-hashed, won't match the hash digest. It's really impossible to tell which is the case unless you're sure you have the right key, meaning that changing the ciphertext or brute-forcing the key will produce the same failure and in roughly the same amount of time, and so these modes are the gold standard for secure communications channels.

","But to answer your question, the .NET AES provider does know if you're using the wrong key - but that's only because you asked it to.
You tried to encrypt the bytes:
2,5,1,6,7

Using code something like:
var plainText = new byte[] {2,5,1,6,7};
byte[] cipherText;

var key = new Byte[] {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
var iv = new Byte[] {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};

//encrypt plaintext using one key
using (var aes = Aes.Create())
{
   var crypt = aes.CreateEncryptor(key, iv);
   cipherText = crypt.TransformFinalBlock(plainText, 0, plainText.Length);
}

In reality, AES only operates on 16-byte blocks. In order to transform your input data into something long enough that it can actually encrypt, the input bytes are first padded. When you construct an Aes class in .NET:
using (var aes = Aes.Create())
{
}

the default padding mode in Aes is PKCS#7 padding. This causes the Aes encrypted to pad your plainText to:
2, 5, 1, 6, 7, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11

And those byes are then encrypted into:
210, 49, 160, 164, 2, 53, 121, 254, 79, 249, 91, 111, 104, 173, 50, 207

When you decrypt those cipher bytes:
byte[] recoveredPlainText;
using (var aes = Aes.Create())
{
   var key = new Byte[] { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
   var iv = new Byte[] { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
   var crypt = aes.CreateDecryptor(key, iv);
   recoveredPlainText = crypt.TransformFinalBlock(cipherText, 0, cipherText.Length);
}

Aes knows to ensure that proper PKCS#7 padding exists:

2, 5, 1, 6, 7 , 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11

If you tried to decrypt with an invalid key (e.g. {1,0,0, ..., 0}), you will end up with plainText that does not contain valid PKCS#7 padding:

154,203,183,159,52,162,186,41,127,162,152,75,114,109,107,74

And so the Aes decryptor will throw an exception. 
You can still decrypt the bytes with an invalid key, all you have to do is tell Aes not to look for any padding by setting Padding = PaddingMode.None:
byte[] recoveredPlainText;
using (var aes = Aes.Create())
{
   aes.Padding = PaddingMode.None;
   var key = new Byte[] { 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
   var iv = new Byte[] { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
   var crypt = aes.CreateDecryptor(key, iv);
   recoveredPlainText = crypt.TransformFinalBlock(cipherText, 0, cipherText.Length);
}

tl;dr: It knows because you used Padding.

"9386693","Android AES password-based encryption using one key and random IV for every message","I'm currently implementing a symmetric en-/decryption using AES 256 on Android, inspired by this post:
Java 256bit AES Encryption.
The purpose of my implementation is that I want to encrypt the data in a database.
For key generation I use the following constructor which takes a char[] password:
public Cryptography(char[] password) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException,
        InvalidKeySpecException, NoSuchPaddingException {

    SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBEWITHSHA256AND256BITAES-CBC-BC"");
    KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password, salt, 1024, 256);
    secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(factory.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded(), ""AES"");
    cipher = Cipher.getInstance(AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding);
}

So when I start my Activity in Android I initialize a new instance of my Cryptography class and therefore get a generated key. The salt is a fixed random byte[] of 16 bytes. So that means that I always get the same key. The reason for that later.
Now after I got an object in one Activity I can use the following encrypt and decrypt methods with always the same key:
public byte[] encrypt(String cleartext) throws InvalidKeyException,
        IllegalBlockSizeException, BadPaddingException,
        UnsupportedEncodingException, InvalidParameterSpecException {

    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);

    byte[] encText = cipher.doFinal(cleartext.getBytes(CHARSET_NAME));
    byte[] iv = cipher.getParameters()
            .getParameterSpec(IvParameterSpec.class).getIV();

    byte[] enc = new byte[IV_SIZE + encText.length];

    for (int i = 0; i < enc.length; i++) {
        if (i < IV_SIZE)
            enc[i] = iv[i];
        else if (i < enc.length)
            enc[i] = encText[i - IV_SIZE];
    }

    return enc;
}

public String decrypt(byte[] encryptedText) throws InvalidKeyException,
        InvalidAlgorithmParameterException, UnsupportedEncodingException,
        IllegalBlockSizeException, BadPaddingException {

    byte[] iv = new byte[IV_SIZE];
    byte[] dec = new byte[encryptedText.length - IV_SIZE];

    for (int i = 0; i < encryptedText.length; i++) {
        if (i < IV_SIZE)
            iv[i] = encryptedText[i];
        else if (i < encryptedText.length)
            dec[i - IV_SIZE] = encryptedText[i];
    }

    cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey, new IvParameterSpec(iv));

    return new String(cipher.doFinal(dec), CHARSET_NAME);
}

As you can see, I save a fresh new IV along with the ciphertext everytime I encrypt a message.
In conclusion: I use ONE encryption key, ONE random salt and a new IV for EVERY field in a database table.
First I wanted to generate a new key with a new salt and a new IV everytime I encrypt ONE field in the database table and save the required salt and IV with along with the ciphertext, or at least for one table row. But the reason why I did it like above mentioned is, because generating a key on an Android device takes to much time. I tested in on an emulator, but it took about two seconds for generating a key. This is why I just generated one key when an Activity is started.
So finally my question:
With my approach, is it secure enough by using just one key, but fresh random IV's for every message? Currently, I don't see another way to make it as secure as possible by keeping it in balance with performance.
I hope it is clear enough what I wrote and somebody could give me some advice on that.
Kind Regards

","I believe the question is not relevant for you (xoidberg), but it might be relevant for some other people.
From what I understand - you use the salt to create a (securely random) key from password. If every user has a random (different) salt - it is ok. Otherwise it might be problematic.
I believe that this is what you did, so it seems (to me) to be ok.
I just want to mention that usually you want to use salts when you save hash function of some values (usually password). Hash functions like MD5 or the SHAs do not have a key, and you must add randomness for this purpose. This is why you need the salt, and this is why in this case you usually need random salt for each value (if you just save passwords hashes with the same salt, one can detect the most common hashes and learn that the password of the users with the most common hash is 123456). In your case - every user needs a unique salt.
About the IV - you really need a random one each time (so it's ok).

","If OpenSSL is not installed then, there is no other method besides looking for a plain PHP implementation on the web.
If it is installed, you can check with openssl_get_cipher_methods() whether the installed version supports GCM. Use it like this:
$strong;
$iv = openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(12, $strong);
if (!$strong) {

Thanks to Scott Arciszewski for noting in the comments that this doesn't work at all for PHP < 7.1, because the authentication tag cannot be retrieved during encryption and therefore the decryption will always fail without it.
If mcrypt is installed, you may check if GCM is available there through mcrypt_list_modes, but I highly doubt it.

","Here's what I'm going to suggest... grab the TEST version of ESAPI.properties from GitHub (""wget https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/master/src/test/resources/esapi/ESAPI.properties"" should work, you use 'git' or save if from your browser), put it in place, and first use it AS-IS. If it fails, then there is a problem in you tweaked code. If it works, there was a problem in your ESAPI.properties file. Many people already suggested what to look for in terms of what might be wrong, but the differences should be minor enough that you should be able to spot them by diff'ing yours versus the TEST version in src/test/resources/esapi/ESAPI.properties. (The production version, incidentally, is under 'configuration/esapi/ESAPI.properties' and is not included with the jar because of some bug in the pom.xml which I don't know how to fix as I am not a Maven guru.)
If you have further questions, contact me at my Gmail account which you should be able to find easily enough via Google with my name and the term ""OWASP"". Once we figure out an answer that works for you, either you or I can post an answer back to Stack Overflow, but I don't frequent this forum enough to regularly monitor it. (Although, come to think of it, I probably do get notified of replies.)
Hope this helps,

","The only constraint you've mentioned is low processing impact - but you've provided no details of the strength of the algorithm required.
Also, if the encryption is implemented in PHP, then it will be several orders of magnitude less efficient than native code as provided by the mcrypt extension (and others).

An encrypted value will be stored as a session_id

Why????
The session id is randomly generated and therefore not predictable / guessable. And sessions provide a mechanism for storing data on the server. If the issue is to maintain secure data outside of the session due to shared hosting constraints, then this is not the right way to solve the problem.
There are native PHP implementations of various algorithms, TEA being an obvious choice, and str_rot13() is available even if mcrypt/openssl extensions are unavailable. But I can see no logical application of these methods to any problem.

","Stack overflow is a forum for helping you with coding issues.
This question is more suited to The security forum. 
That said, there are some standardized guidelines for encryption.
When implementing a symmetric encryption cipher, it's best to use the AES Algorithm. This is the most secure symmetric key block cipher to date, and is the standard for what we currently consider as ""protected"".
If you're looking to hash passwords, which is the standard for password storage, then there is no need for a key. Use the SHA1 algorithm. In terms of the size of the output, it is the more secure hashing algorithm that is currently in use. Other options are SHA256 and SHA512
Edit: Oh the times they are a changing. And so are the hashing algorithms! People are moving from the SHA family of hashing algorithms to  Bcrypt, which has several other features like introducing a cost factor to protect against rainbow tables.

And JAVA SHA1 example: http://www.herongyang.com/Cryptography/SHA1-Message-Digest-in-Java.html
You can combine SALT + PSK(SHA1) with AES encryption.

Or better use PBKDF2 if you cant use either, bcrypt or scrypt with SHA2.

","Here is your mandatory read: You're Probably Storing Passwords Incorrectly
Now, on the question of how to store ciphered passwords. Don't. Store hashed passwords.

You are probably asking to solve the wrong problem. I suspect you want to create a feature to recover passwords... in that case I'll send you to one of my previous answers if you don't mind.

As an alternative, you may be wanting to store multiple keys for a single user on a client machine. If this is what you want, then your best bet is to secure it with the security the that the operating system offers you. You should not expect to do better than ciphered files for the user provided by means of the operating system.

Otherwise, you basically designing the way over which all of the stored passwords are going to be stolen. Either because what is considered secure now may no longer be considered secure tomorrow, or because we are humans (right?) and we can commit mistakes.
Anyway, your security will be at best as strong as the authentication process of the secondary API (I mean, the one to retrieve the key to decipher the passwords). You do mention Java, what are the chances of your java code being reverse engineered to discover how to get the passwords?

i'm not sure if [...] This method is secure enough

No it isn't. Any method of password storage that allows the recovery of a password rather than a secure method of resetting it is not considered to be 'secure' by most. Additionally, how does is the user sent their 'recovered' password? Because using email to do this is just about the worst possible method.
If you cannot get around having to be able to ""recover"" the password, then what you want is asymmetric [aka public key] encryption. The password would be encrypted by the public key and stored in the database for comparison. The private key should be kept separate, ideally offline on a memory stick in a safe, and protected by at least one password, if not two or more passwords held by separate people.
As others have mentioned this question is better suited to http://security.stackexchange.com than here, but it has already been asked many times, and you will get more strongly-worded encouragements about not doing it this way at all rather than solutions.

","As I understand it, the exception is thrown when the last byte read is not a valid padding byte. When you intentionally close the stream early, the last byte read will most likely be considered ""invalid padding"" and the exception is thrown.

","Close calls Dispose(true) which calls FlushFinalBlock which throws the exception, because this is not really the final block.
You can prevent this by overriding the Close method so that it doesn't call FlushFinalBlock:
public class SilentCryptoStream : CryptoStream {
    public SilentCryptoStream(Stream stream, ICryptoTransform transform, CryptoStreamMode mode) :
        base(stream, transform, mode) {
    }

    public override void Close() {
        this.Dispose(false);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }
}

(You also need to manually close the underlying stream.)

is it valid to check if reader.EndOfStream is false and then capture
  the CryptographicException

I think it's OK.

","This exception is thrown during Dispose(true).  Throwing from Dispose is already a design flaw (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/ca1065-do-not-raise-exceptions-in-unexpected-locations#dispose-methods), but it's even worse since this exception is thrown even before the underlying stream is closed.
This means that anything that receives a Stream that might be a CryptoStream needs to work around this and either close the underlying Stream themselves in a 'catch' block (essentially needing a reference to something completely unrelated), or somehow warn all listeners that the stream may still be open (e.g., ""don't try to delete the underlying file -- it's still open!"").
No, in my book, this is a pretty big oversight, and the other answers don't seem to address the fundamental issue.  CryptoStream takes ownership of the passed-in stream, so it takes on the responsibility to close the underlying stream before control leaves Dispose(true), end of story.
Ideally, it should also never throw under circumstances that are not truly exceptional (such as ""we stopped reading early, because the decrypted data is in the wrong format and it's a waste of time to continue reading"").
Our solution was basically this (update: but be warned -- as Will Krause pointed out in the comments, this could leave sensitive information lying around in the private _InputBuffer and _OutputBuffer fields that can be accessed via reflection.  Versions 4.5 and above of the .NET Framework don't have this problem.):

","My solution was to, in my derived class, add this to my Dispose(bool) override:
    protected override void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        // CryptoStream.Dispose(bool) has a bug in read mode. If the reader doesn't read all the way to the end of the stream, it throws an exception while trying to
        // read the final block during Dispose(). We'll work around this here by moving to the end of the stream for them. This avoids the thrown exception and
        // allows everything to be cleaned up (disposed, wiped from memory, etc.) properly.
        if ((disposing) &&
            (CanRead) &&
            (m_TransformMode == CryptoStreamMode.Read))
        {
            const int BUFFER_SIZE = 32768;
            byte[] buffer = new byte[BUFFER_SIZE];

            {
            }
        }

        base.Dispose(disposing);
        ...

By making sure the stream is always read to the end, the internal issue in the CryptStream.Dispose is avoided. Of course, you need to weigh this against the nature of what you are reading, to be sure it doesn't have a negative impact. Only use it against a source of a known finite length.

If it would be possible, it would mean the entire cryptography feature in SQL Server was useless. Can you define what we lost the symmetric key and database certificate means? Your only chance is if your understanding of 'lost' is incorrect and you still have the keys somewhere. SQL Server will refuse to drop keys if there is still data encrypted with them.

","When using symmetric key to encrypt data, it uses a GUID for encryption. The GUID is generated automatically at the time of creatiion of symmetric key. So if u are trying to decrypt the data using newly generated symmetric key (same as old one), it will use the new GUID and as a result you cant decrypt it.
You can see this by using the following query: (Key_Guid is changing)

"3354749","Calculation of encrypted file size does not match true size","I have the need to calculate the size of a file I am encrypting using Rijndael.
According to other answers on this site, and on google, the following is the correct way of calculating encrypted data length:
EL = UL + (BS - (UL Mod BS) Mod BS)

Where: 
EL = Encrypted Length
UL = Unencrypted Length
BS = Block Size

In my instance, the unencrypted file length is 5,101,972 bytes, and I am using a 128bit encryption key, giving me a block size of 16 bytes.
Therefore, the equation is:
EL = 5101972 + (16 - (5101972 Mod 16) Mod 16)
EL = 5101972 + (16 - 4 Mod 16)
EL = 5101972 + (12 Mod 16)
EL = 5101972 + 12
EL = 5101984

Giving an encrypted file length of 5,101,984 bytes.
However, the size of my file after encryption weighs in at 5,242,896
A massive difference in sizes of 140,912 bytes!

Note: In the calculations at the start, I am NOT including the extra 24 bytes that are used at the start of the encrypted file by myself to store the original file length, and the IV... I know this, but didn't want to complicate the equation more than necessary.
","You shouldn't write to the output file before the actual encryption process.  The CryptoStream will handle all the necessary padding when it is closed.  Also the for loop isn't necessary as the inner while loop will read the entire file.  Also you should only write as much as was read from the file.  Try these changes.

[edit]
Oh I've missed out on a lot of information.  I misread what your sizes were thinking 140,912 was the size, not difference.  Now that I see that, I can make more intelligible response.  Based on your code, the difference in sizes should be comparable to your chunk size.  Since the chunkSize can be somewhat large, your code will typically write up to chunkSize more data than is actually in your input file (as Greg and caf pointed out).  The line that I've marked is the reason for the discrepancy.

","You cannot just use the cipher text as input for the String constructor, as you are doing in this line:
encryptedMessage = new String(encryptedData, ""UTF-8"");

You will have to use an encoding such as Base 64 as you did with the keys, if you want to communicate the cipher text using strings instead of bytes.
Encryption will result in data that looks like random bytes. Not all bytes have a character equivalent. The result of the conversion depends on the character encoding. UTF-8 may use many bytes, and many combinations won't result in correct characters. Java silently converts these, check the Charset and related classes for more information.

It doesn't throw any errors that I can see

Have you tested your configuration to verify that you can you see errors when they occur?

but returns blank on my local windows box

If it's returning then it's not causing a fatal error. Hence the mcrypt functions are defined. Have you checked that the constants are defined? Have you checked that the version of libmcrypt matches the PHP extension requirement?
Have you checked that the inputs to the mcrypt_*() functions look sensible?
return trim(base64_encode(mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, $salt, $text, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB, mcrypt_create_iv(mcrypt_get_iv_size(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB), MCRYPT_RAND))));  

Even if the above worked, its a horrible bit of code. The reason for writing code and using high level languages is not so your computer can understand them but so human beings can understand the code:
$iv=mcrypt_create_iv(mcrypt_get_iv_size(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB);
$encypted=mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, $salt, $text, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB
               , $iv, MCRYPT_RAND); 
$encoded=base64_encode($encrypted);
return $encoded;

(laying your code out like this also makes it simpler to inject checks, breakpoints and other debugging measures).

","I had a look in the latest Kamstrup docs (""Wireless M-Bus Communication Kamstrup Water Meters - MULTICAL® 21 and flowIQ® water meters Mode C1 according to EN 13757-4:2013"")
When I decrypt your packet I find:
25877968217E8E01000000000000000000
Firstly, it seems the Kamstrup decrypted packets does not start with 2F 2F.
The first 2 bytes of the decrypted packet is supposedly the PLCRC (I can't confirm that right now - don't have immediate access to the standard that defines the crc polynomial algorithm), and then the next byte is 79, which means it is a Compact Frame, then the next 4 bytes are 2 more CRCs, and then the next 2 bytes 0100 is probably the Info, which is manufacturer specific and I don't know how to interpret that yet.
This meter is probably R type 1, right? (on the face place, the ""Con.:"" parameter's 3rd last digit should be a 1) So its format would be [Info][Volume][Target Volume] - 2 bytes, 4 bytes, 4 bytes - I kind of assume that, since this packet is a compact packet, so I don't get the actual format the long packet would have, e.g. number of decimals - which normally you'd need - but your values are zeroes? so decimals doesn't matter. (the 'long' packet of course is every 6th packet or so?)
The IV I get is:
2D2C454571631B162031FB7C20000000
which is exactly the same as yours.
The encrypted packet I use is:
39A379604B90BDFCBE8DD8CB18CE77DC41
so I exclude the CE and 8C you had on yours? 
When I put them in, the decrypted packet becomes:
25877968217E8E01000000000000000000BB49
which is pretty much the same packet with some more crc stuff at the back, I suspect, so I really do not get what you do to decrypt, since your result is completely different?
Ok, maybe you use AES/CBC/NoPadding, as in OpenMUC.
Kamstrup uses AES/CTR/NoPadding. That is how they don't have to decrypt multiples of 16 byte blocks? The way that looks in my Java code is as follows:
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CTR/NoPadding"");

My project requires me to use symmetric data encryption (using AES), in a Nodejs environment, to secure data on a database (mongodb). Ideally, I would like to do this as follows:
Store the symmetric key in Azure Key Vault as a Key, then make 'encrypt' calls to the vault to perform AES encryption on the data with the Key. The encrypted data is sent in the response to my app and then stored in the database in its encrypted form.
I am confused after reading MS Azure's documentation and related blog posts, where some sources claim symmetric key encryption is supported, but there is no official documentation on this.
Can anyone advise whether this an exhaustive list of all key types and algorithms supported for Azure's Key Vault?

If indeed symmetric keys/encryption are not currently supported, can anyone offer an alternative means to my approach described above?
Thanks and much appreciated.
","I agree the documentation/blogs do seem a little confusing on this topic.  From my understanding the key vault does not yet currently support symmetric encryption.  I believe the closest you can get is storing symmetric keys as secrets and using them outside of the vault.
This article talks about doing such.  See the section where the heading is Use Key Vault secrets
I understand your using node.js and that example is in powershell just trying to illustrate the example of symmetric encryption with a secret.  Obviously the crypto operations happen outside the vault.  So, at rest the keys are more secure but do get exposed in memory anytime an operation occurs.
Hope that helps.

Here is an example in PowerShell of creating a secret in Key Vault that can be used as a SymmetricKey.

I found the solution using application policy but in order for a policy to be visible to JBoss the server must be restarted - which is not an option for me.
Is there another method of securing the password?
","The class org.jboss.resource.security.SecureIdentityLoginModule can be used to both encrypt database passwords and to provide a decrypted version of the password when the data source configuration is required by the server. The SecureIdentityLoginModule uses a hard-coded password to encrypt/decrypt the data source password. 
The data source password is encrypted using the SecureIdentityLoginModule main method by passing in the clear text password. The SecureIdentityLoginModule is provided by jbosssx.jar. 
This procedure is for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform versions 5.1 and later

GoTo Jboss directory or  Change directory to the jboss-as directory
 for Example  user/demo/Jboss/
Linux command

java -cp client/jboss-logging-spi.jar:lib/jbosssx.jar org.jboss.resource.security.SecureIdentityLoginModule PASSWORD
or 
java -cp bin/client/jboss-logging-spi.jar:standalone/lib/ext/jbosssx.jar org.jboss.resource.security.SecureIdentityLoginModule PASSWORD
Windows command:
java -cp client\jboss-logging-spi.jar;lib\jbosssx.jar org.jboss.resource.security.SecureIdentityLoginModule PASSWORD
Result:
The command will return an encrypted password.

Important Note

:If you got error after executing this command 
 In this case check , you should have  "" jbosssx.jar "", "" jboss-logging-spi.jar "" in your jboss.
it should be under lib directory or may in standalone/lib/ext/
(In the cammand it's taking path for this jar to encrypt the password)

Kindly, I need the answer with clarification. The cipher always ends with =. Could this be because of the padding? Can you explain to me why/how the cipher is resulted with this length? And always ends with =? 
Is my code correct or there is a mistake? I have doubts in the encoding part.
","There are several things going on:

msg.getBytes() returns the bytes representing an encoding of the string using the ""platform's default charset"" (e.g. could be UTF-8 or UTF-16 or ..): specify the encoding manually to avoid confusion! In any case, see msgBytes.length to get the true plain text length.
DES, being a block cypher, will have output padded along a block size boundary - but this will always be larger than the plain text (refer to msgBytes.length) length when using PKCS#5 because the plain text is always padded with [1,8] bytes. To see what the true encrypted size is, see textEncrypted.length.
The encrypted bytes are encoded using base-64 and this process - which is independent of the encryption - inflates the number of bytes required by about 33% (as only 6 bits per character/byte are used). The Java base-64 implementation also adds padding which is where the trailing ""="" character is introduced.

As long as you (or someone else with the correct algorithm and cipher key) can retrieve the initial string - by performing the inverse of each step in reverse order, then it works. If a particular step does not have an inverse/reverse operation or cannot be ""undone"", then something is wrong; but this also means that every step can be individually tested.

To the numbers!

msg.getBytes() returns an ASCII/UTF-8 encoded sequence (if it used UTF-16 or another another ""wide"" encoding then the numbers below would be too large)
Therefore, msgBytes.length is 24
And since msgBytes.length mod 8 is 0, the plain text is padded with 8 bytes that have the value of 0x08 (per CKCS#5)
Thus, textEncrypted.length is 32 (24 data + 8 padding)
Due to base-64 encoding, 32 bytes * 1.33 ~ 43 characters
And with base-64 padding (=), the final result is 44 characters!

","The result of a DES encryption will always be a multiple of 8 bytes. The input is also padded to a multiple of 8 bytes according to the padding algorithm specified.
The base 64 encoding encodes each 3 bytes into 4 characters (3x8 = 4x6 = 24), and ensures the output length is a multiple of 4 by padding with = characters. 
So, the 44 characters output corresponds to 33 bytes, but the = at the end indicates that in fact there were only 32 bytes. Which is fine, since 24 bytes clear data with PKCS5 padding becomes 32 bytes.

","It all depends on how the different parts/arguments of the encryption are used.
AES is used to encrypt bytes. So you need to convert the string to a byte array. So you need to know the encoding used to convert the string. (UTF7, UTF8, ...).  
The key in AES has some fixed sizes. So you need to know, how to come from a passphrase to an AES key with the correct bitsize.
Since you provide both salt and IV, I suppose the salt is not the IV. There is no standard way to handle the Salt in .Net. As far as I remember a salt is mainly used to protect against rainbow tables and hashes. The need of a Salt in AES is unknown to me.
Maybe the passphrase is hashed (you did not provide the method for that) with the salt to get an AES key.
The IV is no secret. The easiest method is to prepend the encrypted data with the IV. Seen the length of the encrypted data, this is not the case.
I don't think your unfamiliarity of .Net is the problem here. You need to know what decisions the implementer of the encryption made, to come from your parameters to the encrypted string.

"11027708","Include an encrypted password in a URL? Possible?","We have a typical web-based login system. We want customers to have the ability to generate a ""login link"" that doesn't ever expire and includes their password.
We want to therefore create a link which includes their password in encrypted form.
NOTE: I know the best way is a lookup table where each link has a unique key... I won't go into why that won't work for us; it won't.
I'm not familiar with public key encryption.. Maybe that's what I need?
Here's what I'm thinking. This still might not be enough, so please let me know:
Definition: user-password refers to the user's password that we want in encrypted form in the link.
We cannot use one encryption key for all user-passwords because it may be possible to derive the encryption key by generating tons of links, so...

Use a standard form of symmetric encryption.
The server has a text file with 1000 complex encryption keys.
When a link is generated (using the PHP script that has that list), one of the 1000 encyption keys is chosen to encrypt their plaintext password (chosen in sequence, not at random to prevent the same from being chosen close to the same time).
Before encrypting the user's password, add something like ""s345lm34l5k342342343534432324sdfs"" to the start of it, to ""salt"" it. (Ex: password1 becomes s345lm34l5k342342343534432324sdfspassword1). ""Salting"" makes it harder to decrypt against dictionary attacks. This salt is kept private. But, of course, there's the risk it can be compromised and it's one salt for all passwords, so...
In addition, there's a second randomly generated salt added to the password. This salt is encrypted with a single strong password. Because both the salt and the password encrypting it is a random pattern of bytes, it makes it harder to determine the salt.
The link maker tool only lets you generate 15 links every 10 minutes, and then locks out the IP.
The link maker tool doesn't not generate links unless the user/password provided to it is actual a functioning user/password combination. That way, if someone is just try to generate links to determine the encryption info, it won't work. Still, theoretically, they could obtain a valid user/password and try to brute force.

Is this secure?
","No, because the encrypted password has become the password. Have you tried SSL? SSL should solve your problems, you can just use a plain URL on HTTP level.

","What you need to do is take your data and put it into a byte array. Then once it is in a byte array, you can encrypt it using an encryption algorithm. Then you write it to the file.
When you want to get the original data back, you have to read the byte array from the file, then decrypt the byte array and then you will have your original data. You cannot just read this data as a string because your encryption algorithm will create bytes that cannot be represented as regular chars so your data will get messed up.
Just make sure you read the encrypted data as a byte array and not a string, that is where you are having a problem.

If you want to write multiple byte arrays to a single file, then you should probably do something like this since you are using Java:
writer.print(arr.length);
writer.print(arr);
writer.flush();

Do this for each byte array. Then when you read the byte arrays back:
int length = reader.readInt();
byte[] bytes = new byte[length];
// fill array

This way the file can be structured like this:

[length of following array][array][length of second array][second array]

You will be able to put all of the byte arrays back to back, and since each array starts with the length of the array, you will know how much data needs to be put into each array.

Don't use direct hash of the passphrase, but use (or create) a KDF
You definitely should use IV. You can store it as the first block of your file.
I would personally probably use AES_MODE.CTR - See Wikipedia for Why? and Alex Martelli's answer to this old question for How?

"9989622","Encrypting/decrypting large files with PyCrypto - strategies","Im currently trying to learn some stuff about encryption, it's algorithms and how it works in general. I was thinking about a way to go for encrypting large files and the only way feasible to me seems using a symmetric key algorithm. 
So i was looking at AES, and while passing 64k or 32k blocks of bytes to a AES object that you create using a hash of the password seems ok  , i'm still curious as to the safest way to do this as i keep reading that cryptography is very easy to mess up.
So i get a passphrase, i get its SHA256 checksum, i use that for a key when creating my encrypt/decrypt object.
Other things i couldn't find an answer for : should i use an IV ? if so i have to make sure the object uses the same IV on decryption that it used on encryption...how do i do that?

","To look at some of your questions.
Use CTR mode or CBC mode for most purposes.  If you need built-in authentication use Galois Counter Mode (GCM).  Otherwise use a separate HMAC for authentication, with a different key.
An IV is needed with all three suggested modes, though in CTR mode it is sometimes called a nonce instead.  It can be sent in clear, and is usually prepended to the cyphertext.
Padding should always be used.  Select PKCS7 or PKCS5, they are effectively the same.
For learning about Cryptography, I would suggest 'Practical Cryptography' by Ferguson and Schneier. I understand that there is an updated version, called 'Cryptography Engineering', which I have not read.

given the same cert master key and key credentials

There is no such concept as 'cert master key'. Do not invent your own terms, stick to the existing nomenclature so everyone understands what you're saying. There is a master key, there are certificates. 
If you followed good practices and you deployed a correct encryption hierarchy then your data should be encrypted with one or more symmetric keys and these in turn would be encrypted with a certificate that is either encrypted with the database master key or a password.
Copying data encrypted with a symmetric key between databases is possible. In order to succeed you need to follow exactly the steps described in Create Identical Symmetric Keys on Two Servers which will result in a pair of keys that have the same identity and the same key material. Data encrypted with either one of the two servers can be decrypted on the other server.
That being said, any organization that is serious enough about data as to encrypt it in production and at the same time is willing to create a copy of the encryption key on dev machines, not to mention copy actual sensitive data to the dev boxes, is a joke imho. Technology is never the weak link.

","Your encryption can produce null (ascii decimal 0), carriage return (ascii decimal 13), and newline (ascii decimal 10) bytes, all of which will wreak havoc when you write the value to a file and then try to read it back in again. It is possible to work with carriage return and newline within environment variables, but null is an absolute no go.
Well, almost end of story. Batch can use FC in binary mode to read a binary file, byte by byte, outputting each byte in hex notation. (see HEXDUMP.BAT) But I don't think you want to go there.
If you want to deal with encrypted values within batch environment variables, then I suggest you come up with a new encryption scheme that avoids the troublesome bytes. At a minimum you must avoid null bytes.
Another option would be to abandon symmetric encryption, and let VBS convert the encrypted form into hex notation before you write it to disk.
Which leads me to another concern - Why are you writing a password to disk? That does not sound like a good idea.
Final note - Passing arbitrary strings on the command line is fraught with peril. You are better off passing the name of an environment variable that contains the value, and then let the called routine get the value from the variable. Certainly VBS can read an environment variable given the variable name.

AES-256 CBC 128-bit block size.
random Initialization Victor IV of 16b fixed length. 
PKCS7Padding

I don't even know if these are the defaults or not or even if I'm asking in the right place. How can I make a key like this?
","Your requirements cannot be correct. AES is a symmetric algorithm, which means both parties should have the same secret key. Key pairs are generated for asymmetric encryption such as RSA.
Most of the time AES and RSA are used together for encryption. This is called hybrid encryption: a random AES key is generated and used to encrypt the plaintext. Then the AES key is encrypted with the RSA public key (using OAEP padding, for instance). Then the resulting ciphertext and the encrypted key are send to the other party, which can decrypt the AES key using the private key, and then the ciphertext with the AES key.
If you just need to give a secret key you must use secure transport. An AES key can be 256 bits secure random key, which can easily be extracted from /dev/urandom, e.g.:
dd bs=1 count=32 if=/dev/urandom of=aes-256-key.bin

for RSA, use the openssl command line, for instance.

One C# developer i talked with suggested symmetric/asymmetric algorithm but he is not a PHP developer so he doesn't know if php can take that data and decrypt it.
","It seems you are concerned with the security of the data while being transferred from the client app to the server, and vice versa. As has been mentioned in the comments, an HTTPS connection will be sufficient in this regard. It automatically performs encryption/decryption for you.
To get an HTTPS connection working, you would purchase an SSL certificate (Namecheap is one website where you can buy one) and install it on your web server. The certificate is automatically installed on a user's local machine the first time he/she connects to the server, and each subsequent connection performs a check for a valid certificate. So basically, you just install the certificate on the server and don't have to worry about it until you have to renew your certificate. Just make sure that your client app attempts to connect to an HTTPS address instead of an HTTP.
If you were to implement symmetric/asymmetric encryption, it would help with encryption and decryption before and after the data is transferred. If you encrypt the data in your client app, you will have to decrypt it on the server side when you receive it, and vice versa. This would provide you with even stronger security; however, depending on the nature of your app, an HTTPS connection may be enough.
One of my personal projects is a client C# app that connects to a Ruby web server, which I also wrote. I installed an SSL certificate on my Ruby web server so that data is encrypted while in transit. In my case, the data being transferred does not contain any user data or PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and therefore does not pose a security risk if an external party gains access to this information. As such, I felt using encryption before and after transit was not worthwhile nor would provide any benefit to the end user. Again, this depends on the nature of your app and your users' expectations.
EDIT:
As mine mentioned in the comments, StartSSL offers free SSL certificates.

","To answer your further questions, when a server is issued and properly configured with a good cert, you shouldn't need to do anything more.
Using HTTPS
HTTPS works by verifying SSL certifications with a Certificate Authority (CA) during an initial handshake. Certificate Authorities, which is essentially a list of signatures that are used to verify said certs, usually come preloaded by an OS vendor.
Assuming your server has a CA issued certificate, all you will be required to do is change from using HTTP to HTTPS when making the connection. The library you're using should have a method of verifying the servers SSL cert, if it doesn't automatically do this for you.
There is no technical reason that you should have to encrypt anything that will being sent over HTTPS, so long as the certificate is strongly encrypted.
Also, if you would like to dig deeper into the nitty-gritty details of how HTTPS works, there's this very good post over on Information Security that sheds a little light on the inner workings of the protocol.
To answer your original question
For the sake of completeness.
PHP has the cryptography extension mcrypt which supports various algorithms and cipher operation modes. I've put together a simple example using AES 256 / PBKDF-SHA1 key decryption (along with the C# code to perform the encryption).
EDIT: I'd like to point out that hash_pbkdf2 is only available in PHP 5.5 and up. Support down to 5.3 can be added with this nifty trick.
PHP
function decode_aes($data, $key) // Decrypt custom format data string
{
    $iv_size = mcrypt_get_iv_size(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC);
    $salt_size = 16;

    $iv = substr($data, 0, $iv_size); // Init vector
    $salt = substr($data, $iv_size, $salt_size); // The salt
    $extact = substr($data, $iv_size + $salt_size); // This is the encrypted data

    $key = hash_pbkdf2(""sha1"", $key, $salt, 1000, 32, true); // Sets to use PBKDF-SHA1

    return mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, $key, $extact, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $iv); // Perform the decryption with the extracted sections
}

","Doesn't Java have cryptography build in... Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) & Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)?
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/CryptoSpec.html#ProviderArch

The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) extends the JCA API to include
  APIs for encryption, key exchange, and Message Authentication Code
  (MAC). Together, the JCE and the cryptography aspects of the SDK
  provide a complete, platform-independent cryptography API.

Here's an example of how to use AES in Java:
http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Security/AES/AES_v1.html

The JCE framework is a very powerful and flexible framework for using
  different cryptographic algorithms. It's based on a provider
  architecture that enables the same framework to be used for newer
  cryptographic algorithms. From a developer perspective, this means a
  higher level of abstraction, and a common set of APIs for newer and
  different cryptographic algorithms -- without the need to worry about
  the inner workings of the algorithm.
Some of the other Java security APIs -- such as JSSE -- are
  implemented on top of JCE, and supplement it to make the different
  cryptographic algorithms (ciphers, Message Authentication Codes
  (MACs), and Key Exchange algorithms) available to in a more
  developer-friendly manner.

Also, as Kristian Antonsen mentioned, check out SSLSocket.

","I think the encryptionAlgorithm parameter only matters when you are first doing the encryption (that is, when you are first creating an encrypted database, or when you are first encrypting an unencrypted database).
Once you have encrypted the database, from then on, you just need to specify the bootPassword. Derby already knows what encryption algorithm was used.

"1925134","Can Derby / JavaDB _really_ encrypt with Triple DES rather than (plain) DES?","It seems to be confusing Triple-DES (>128bit) with plain DES (64bit).
I'm trying to encrypt a Derby database with Triple DES (or DESede) using Java 1.5
I found this discussion forum message about a problem with JDK 1.5 by chance and so checked to make sure that it really was using DESede and not plain DES. When I created the database with a Triple DES (168bit) URL
jdbc:derby:MySecureDB;dataEncryption=true;encryptionAlgorithm=DESede/CBC/NoPadding;bootPassword=$ecureC@deCanBr@kE0074242

","I believe that the documentation is wrong, and that you do not actually need to specify the encryption algorithm to use when using a non-default algorithm, since the algorithm that should be used is specified in $DERBY_HOME/database/service.properties
In my case, when I created a database with your parameters my service.properties had the following contents (amongst other non-relevant entries):
log_encrypt_algorithm_version=1
encryptionAlgorithm=DESede/CBC/NoPadding
dataEncryption=true
derby.encryptionBlockSize=8
encryptionKeyLength=168-24
encryptedBootPassword=472b7cc5600605333392dd10a46067d2e2935fd4c350d533-43435
data_encrypt_algorithm_version=1

You can verify that this is used, by changing the algorithm used. If you change the specified algorithm in that file to DES, then you will not be able to restart the database.
For example:
$ ../bin/ij
ij version 10.4
ij> connect 'jdbc:derby:testdb;create=true;dataEncryption=true;encryptionAlgorithm=Blowfish/ECB/NoPadding;bootPassword=$ecureC@deCanBr@kE0074242';

If you're going to generate an IV, it should be communicated so your recipient can decrypt the same first block successfully. The C# code does this, the PHP does not.
From a cryptography engineering perspective, you should consider, both in C# land and in PHP, deploying an Encrypt then Authenticate protocol. See this blog post on encryption and authentication. Also, all the crypto code you've ever written is probably broken.

Is CBC the correct AES mode for this use case for this type of field stored in a TEXT field in MySQL?

Well, this depends a bit on your text. But probably yes.

Does the key look like it is generated correctly?

yeah, looks good to me. It should look random and it looks random. Not sure what your concern is here.

Is the IV correct? Is prepending the IV to the encrypted text a proper way to do it or should it be a separate field?

The IV looks good to me. I don't see many reasons why you shouldn't do it this way except one: its not very storage efficient. It would be far more efficient to store the data not as hex string but as binary data! And then you can't just use a colon to seperate the data.

","Sorry. I am changing my answer. What I told before was completely wrong.The reason you are getting the error 
java.lang.NullPointerException: Input string was null.
is because you  have declared
String user;

You have not initialized it and you are calling
String decryptedUser = decrypt(user, key);

now in the function decrypt user is null.

","I think you're making this harder than it needs to be.  For your typescript encryption for example, all you need to do is this:
private async encrypt(obj: any): Promise<string> {
    await Sodium.ready;

    const json = JSON.stringify(obj);
    const key = Sodium.from_hex(this.hexKey);

    const nonce = Sodium.randombytes_buf(Sodium.crypto_aead_chacha20poly1305_ietf_NPUBBYTES);
    const encrypted = Sodium.crypto_aead_chacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(json, '', null, nonce, key);

    // Merge the two together
    const nonceAndCipherText = new Uint8Array(Sodium.crypto_aead_chacha20poly1305_ietf_NPUBBYTES + encrypted.byteLength);
    nonceAndCipherText.set(nonce);
    nonceAndCipherText.set(encrypted, Sodium.crypto_aead_chacha20poly1305_ietf_NPUBBYTES);

    return btoa(String.fromCharCode(...nonceAndCipherText));
}

You don't need all the extra libraries you're using.  And on your PHP side, to decrypt you'd just do this:
function decode($encrypted, $key)
{
    $decoded = base64_decode($encrypted); // Should be using sodium_base642bin?
    if ($decoded === false) {
        throw new Exception('Scream bloody murder, the decoding failed');
    }

    $nonce = mb_substr($decoded, 0, SODIUM_CRYPTO_AEAD_CHACHA20POLY1305_IETF_NPUBBYTES, '8bit');

","I would suggest reading how SSL or OpenPGP are implemented.
I'm not sure what part you are struggling with.
In short, the asymmetric algorithm is used for symmetric key exchange.
The symmetric algorithm is used for the bulk data (stream/block) crypto. You won't get it done with simply modifying your 2 functions, you will need to implement a handshake and key exchange.
Since you have an MVC.NET app, you can host it within a web server and gain HTTPS/SSL transport. You can also do the same with WCF. Any reason why aren't using what is provided by the underlying transport? You can even configure your application (web.config) to require client certificates.
PS: I agree about not re-inventing the wheel, even Microsoft's article that Erik linked to provides a warning about it.

Caution We recommend that you do not attempt to create your own key exchange method from the basic functionality provided, because many details of the operation must be performed carefully in order for the key exchange to be successful.

","In theory yes.
In reality no.
You'll need either to have software running on the same machine that is performing the encryption and attack the system through cache analysis:
""In April 2005, D.J. Bernstein announced a cache-timing attack that he used to break a custom server that used OpenSSL's AES encryption. The custom server was designed to give out as much timing information as possible (the server reports back the number of machine cycles taken by the encryption operation), and the attack required over 200 million chosen plaintexts.""
Or I would imagine that you could use a supercomputer to force crack it. I wouldn't know how long that would take though and so it would only be an issue if the encryption key was never changed. The algorithm is available in the public domain, but you'll still be tied to the implementation as they would have a bearing on the result.

returnpicture.php will decrypt that back into 'x=27&y=3&z=123456' and parse it into three variables which will be used to pick an image and return it.
Problem is, everywhere I look, all I can find is stuff about hashing and encrypting super-sensitive information like credit cards and passwords.  This info is not sensitive at all, I just don't want users to be able to tamper with it.  Therefore, it shouldn't be excessively long.  Also, the encryption (I'm guessing) must be alphanumeric, so as not to mess up the url with & or =.  I'm doing this in php. 
It's for a sort of game.  The user shouldn't be able to mess with the variables, 'cause they'll see things they shouldn't yet.
","For general understanding
When you include certain key-value pairs in your request url, PHP will load these values (accordingly) into the $_GET superglobal.
?x=12&y=13

Will result in
$_GET['x'] // contains 12
$_GET['y'] // contains 13

What you seem to be trying to do is to supply multiple key-value pairs within a key-value pair:
?stuff={more-key-value-pairs}

Simply be aware that PHP will not interpret key-value pairs in $_GET['stuff'].
Encoding/Decoding
Note: This is one possible solution out of many. Find the one that suits you most and apply it.
You can use base64_encode() to encode it, and base64_decode() to decode it.
Example:
echo '<img src=""returnpicture.php?stuff=' . rawurlencode( base64_encode('x=27&y=3&z=123456') ) . '"" />';  

Usage of rawurlencode() assures proper url safe encoding of the base64-encoded string.  
In your returnpicture.php you can use:
$decodedString = base64_decode( $_GET['stuff'] );

to get back your original string.
However, if you actually plan on sending a get-request like string (with variable assignments, such as ?x=12&y=13 and so on, then you need to apply further techniques to get that string parsed. 
See this question for details on how it can be done

","I suggest that you can share information between your pages with $_SESSION vars, but, it only works if two pages are in same context server.
Approach 1. base64 encode
<img src=""returnpicture.php?stuff=<?php echo base64_encode('x=27&y=3&z=123456'); ?>""/>

And get this as:
$data = base64_decode($_GET['stuff']);

Approach 2. $_SESSION variables
You should combine $_GET with $_POST without expose sensible information like:
$postfix = uniqid(); // Generate an UNIQUE id
$_SESSION['sensible_var1_'.$postfix] = ""value"";
$_SESSION['sensible_var2_'.$postfix] = ""value"";
$_SESSION['sensible_var3_'.$postfix] = ""value"";

And you can pass this information only with:
<img src=""returnpicture.php?stuff=<?php echo $postfix; ?>""/>

And in your returnpicture.php file, you can retrive information as:
$sensible_var1 = $_SESSION['sensible_var1_'.$_GET['stuff']];
$sensible_var2 = $_SESSION['sensible_var2_'.$_GET['stuff']];
$sensible_var3 = $_SESSION['sensible_var3_'.$_GET['stuff']];

","You could use a simple cipher, like a rolling XOR hash. This is very easy to implement, but enough of a nuisance to crack that people probably won't bother if the only benefit is something trivial, like the ability to get your server to serve images in non-standard sizes.
function scramble(key, text) {
    return encodeURIComponent(text.replace(/[^\0]/g, function(x, i) {
        var code = x.charCodeAt(0) ^ key.charCodeAt(i % key.length);
        return String.fromCharCode(code);
    }));

function descramble(key, text) {
    return decodeURIComponent(text).replace(/[^\0]/g, function(x, i) {
        var code = x.charCodeAt(0) ^ key.charCodeAt(i % key.length);
        return String.fromCharCode(code);

}

If your key is ""secretcode"" and your text is ""x=27&y=3&z=123456"", then scramble(key, text) returns ""%0BXQEC%0D%5E%5CB%1FNTQAQAU"".
""Descrambling"" that result with the same key gives the original text, ""x=27&y=3&z=123456"".

It's a combination of AES CBC/ECB encryption for the client-side key where the envelope key and initialization vector are stored in the metadata.  
I have a Ruby developer that has encrypted various files in an S3 bucket that I need to retrieve and decrypted with Python.  The Python S3 AWS SDK doesn't currently have this client-side feature.  
Assuming the file was encrypted using the encryption_key parameter of the Ruby bucket.write S3 API:
#!/usr/bin/ruby
# coding: utf-8

require 'aws-sdk'
require 'openssl'

access_key = '<aws_access_key>'

encryption_key = ""passwordpassword""

bucket_obj.write(file: 'test.txt', encryption_key: encryption_key)

Is there a way to decrypt the files with Python instead of using the Ruby SDK?
","Took a bit of tracing through the Ruby S3 SDK but client side-encryption is implemented as ""envelope encryption"" using the AES algorithm.  In short the contents of the envelope are encrypted using AES-CBC with the key and IV stored in the file's metadata (base64 encoded).  The CBC key itself is AES-EBC encoded with the users given encryption key.
The Ruby client-side encrypted file can be decrypted with this Python:
#!/usr/bin/python

These operations are designed to encrypt and decrypt data keys. They use an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) in the encryption operations and they cannot accept more than 4 KB (4096 bytes) of data. Although you might use them to encrypt small amounts of data, such as a password or RSA key, they are not designed to encrypt application data.

It goes on to recommend using AWS Encryption SDK or the Amazon S3 encryption client for encrypting application data.

","I suspect it's about performance: scaling and and latency.
KMS encrypt/decrypt has a limit of 5500 reqs/s per account, which is shared with some other KMS operations.
""Why?"" Is also discussed a bit more thoroughly in the FAQ.

Why use envelope encryption? Why not just send data to AWS KMS to encrypt directly?
While AWS KMS does support sending data less than 4 KB to be encrypted, envelope encryption can offer significant performance benefits. When you encrypt data directly with KMS it must be transferred over the network. Envelope encryption reduces the network load for your application or AWS cloud service. Only the request and fulfillment of the data key through KMS must go over the network. Since the data key is always stored in encrypted form, it is easy and safe to distribute that key where you need it to go without worrying about it being exposed. Encrypted data keys are sent to AWS KMS and decrypted under master keys to ultimately allow you to decrypt your data. The data key is available directly in your application without having to send the entire block of data to AWS KMS and suffer network latency.

","I am going through this issue with AWS support right now. There is the throttling limit mentioned in the accepted answer. Also, if you reuse and cache data keys as allowed by the SDK, you can save money at the expense of lowered security (one data key can decrypt multiple objects).
However, if neither of those are relevant to you, direct CMK encryption is appealing. The security is excellent because the data key cannot be leaked, every decryption requires a API call to KMS and can be audited. In the KMS Best Practices whitepaper, it states that encryption of credit card numbers in this way is PCI compliant.

","The key is 128 (binary) bits. That's all it means.
AES supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
AES has a fixed block size of 128 bits, which means it en/decrypts data in chunks of 16 bytes at a time. The plaintext/cipher text can be any length of course (and is padded out to a multiple of 16 bytes).
Good crypto implementations will use a Key Derivation Function which takes a password (or keyfile, etc) of any length, and generates a key suitable for the encryption algorithm in question.

","There is something - very complex in mathematical theory - called ""whitebox cryptography"". In this case, the AES algorithm is modified in a way, that it builds up the secret during encryption. I do not know exactly, how this is achieved, but this one does not need to have a initialized secret, but the secret is part of the algorithm.
An attacker might see, that your AES implementation is a bit ""different"" but at no time in execution the key is visible in memory. The only chance an attacker will have, is to copy the whole whitebox code but it is really hard to reverse engineer this - he would just be able to use it.

DUKPT: Derived unique key per transaction
","As mentioned in last post ANSI standard that defines DUKPT, X9.24-1 in 3DES mode, that means Dukpt uses 3DES algorithm to generate Key(not to encrypt or decrypt data) and it is known as 3DES-DUKPT.Another type is AES-DUKPT, which uses AES-ECB mode to generate key.
Both have common inputs Base derivation Key(BDK) and KSN with different size.
For 3DES-DUKPT, BDK = 16 bytes(always) and KSN = 10 bytes.
For AES-DUKPT, BDK = 16, 24, 32 bytes(depend upon AES key size) and KSN = 12 bytes.
Input KSN consist of Key_serial_number and Counter.
Input BDK and Key_serial_number (from KSN) generates IPEK.
And IPEK with Counter(from KSN) generates Encryption / Decryption key for data.

","It sounds like you can put up a web or web services server?  Have your server only accept connections by HTTPS, and require client authentication.  Have the other company's server contact your server using HTTPS with a POST request.
Your server will need to present an SSL certificate that the other company's server recognizes as authentic - either you need to get a certificate issued from a CA, or you can create a self signed certificate and have the other company install that certificate in their server's trust store.  The other company will also need to present an SSL certificate that your server recognizes - in this case, it should be a self signed certificate that you install in your trust store, so you aren't accepting connections from just anyone who has a CA issued certificate.
Your software can contact your server with an HTTPS GET request.  The certificate requirements for your client software will be the same as for the other company's server, as described above.

The only requirement I have is that it will need to be placed in the managed code and not in a stored procedure.

","To decrypt before querying sensitive data, all you need to do is to use a DbTransaction in the EF ObjectContext connection.
I.e.

connection.Open();
connection.BeginTransaction();
execute your ""OPEN
SYMMETRIC KEY..."" command or stored procedure with
ExecuteStoreCommand execute your sensitive data queries, stored
procedures etc.
Commit or Rollback you transaction if required

This forces EF to maintain the same db connection because you have started a db transaction and it makes sense because you might execute a whole bunch of SP's as part of the same db transaction.

I'll multiply the key matrix with the matrix of 2 characters then modulus the result on 26 as this equation.
C = E(K, P) = KP mod 26
where: K:key
       P:plain text

I do it like this but there's something wrong. I use the example in my book to test my algorithm. Since plain text is friday and key is:  int key[][] = {{5, 8}, {17, 3}};
 the result should be PQCFKU.
For the first letters f , r  , f= 5  , r=17 order of alphabetic letters
encryption of f is (5*5 + 17*8)%26  =5 => f it should be P 
Where is the error that I make?
","If this: http://slidefinder.net/c/chapter_classical_encryption_techniques_jen/11206531/p2 is your book, the matrix [[5, 8] [17, 3]] is not your encryption key... it is the input matrix.  5 = F, 17 = R, 8 = I, 3 = D.  K is the encryption key, which is not given in the slide.  You would have to solve the linear algebra equation to get K.

Is there 3rd party Encryption package for Metro App ?

","One option is to use BouncyCastle library, they do support Aes/Ofb/NoPadding.
Another option is to use System.Security.Cryptography.Aes from c# framework and encrypt using PaddingMode.Zeros, then truncate encrypted data to the same length as input data (discard padded data at the end of encrypted text).
    When decrypting, append padding (any garbage or zeros) to cipertext to align to the block length, set PaddingMode.None, decrypt, throw away padded bytes at the end (they will be bogus).
Something like this:
        var aes2 = Aes.Create();

            aes2Data, 0, buff.Length);
        Console.WriteLine(""Aes2 size: {0}"", aes2Data.Length);

","No, this is not okay.
1) You're using Encoding.Default in various places. Don't do that - it means you're at the whim of the platform you're on. Always use an explicit encoding, ideally UTF-8 in most cases.
2) You're using Encoding.GetString / Encoding.GetBytes to convert arbitrary binary data to a string and back. That's almost bound to lose data. (It happened to succeed on my machine, but it really depends on the encoding - and it's fundamentally a bad idea.) Encoding is designed for data which is inherently text data, and you're just applying an encoding one way or the other. Your encrypted data is inherently binary data. Use Convert.ToBase64String and Convert.FromBase64String instead.
For your other questions:

Yes, it's okay to store the IV with the encrypted data, as far as I know.
You could use the same approach for the password: generate a different salt each time, and store that with the encrypted text. Not sure whether that's generally recommended or not, I'm afraid.
I believe you're controlling whether the key size is 128 or 256 bits, with your call to passwordBytes.GetBytes(32) - that's a 256-bit key, so it's AES256.
I believe the IV size for AES is always 16 bytes (128 bits)

Is it ok to store the IV together with the encrypted data?

Yes, it is ok. Moreover, you're using AesManaged without explicit setting of Mode - it this case mode is CBC, and in CBC mode IV should preceed cyphertext.

Is there another way to create the key without using the same salt everytime(Based on a given passphrase)?

Rfc2898DeriveBytes is pretty standard way to derive key from text password. There is no need to reinvent way of deriving key from password, just use Rfc2898DeriveBytes as you're doing it now.

Is this encryption done using AES128 or AES256?

It is AES256 since you're using 32-byte password.

Will the IV be always 16byte, or can this change?

The size of the IV property must be the same as the BlockSize property divided by 8. So it is 16 for 128-bit blocks.

","Normally salt is used together with cryptographic hashing of say passwords to protect against dictionary attacks. To get the same kind of protection for symmetric encryption with AES you should use a random initialization vector. So when you encrypt create a random IV and prepend it to the message (in cleartext). When you decrypt get the IV from the encrypted message and use it to decrypt the message. Then the ciphertext of the same message encrypted with the same key will be different.

So, yes, it is OK to store the IV together with the encrypted data.
You do not need a different salt every time because the purpose of the random IV is similar in how salt makes dictionary attacks on hashes harder.
AES can use key sizes of 128, 192 or 256 bits so to use AES 256 you need a 256 bit key (32 bytes) which is what you use.
AES uses a 128 bit block which requires a 128 bit IV (or 16 bytes).

"9519291","TripleDES Decryption truncating last character","I have a .NET class that implements TripleDES encryption and decryption. The code is too much to post here. However, the problem is that while encryption is OK, decryption is inconsistent depending on the length of the original plaintext. I know that encryption is OK since other triple DES tools also give same value.
Specifically, the last character is being cut off from the resulting plain text if the Length of the original Plaintext was 8,16,24,32,40 etc i.e 8n.
The encryption mode is CBC
The key size is 24 chars(192bits)
The IV is 8 chars
","The problem is because the (un)padding algorithm is not correct.
(3)DES encrypts/decrypts blocks of 8 bytes. As not all texts are precisely 8 bytes, the last block must contain bytes that are not original from the plain text. Now the trick is to find out which one is the last character of the plain text. Sometimes the length of the plain text is known beforehand - then the padding characters can be anything really.
If the length of the plain text is not known then a deterministic padding algorithm must be used, e.g. PKCS5Padding. PKCS5Padding always performs padding, even if the plaintext is N * blocksize in bytes. The reason for this is simple: otherwise it doesn't know if the last byte is plain text or padding: 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 08 08 08 08 08 08 08 08 would be 8 'A' characters, with 8 padding bytes.
It seems that either the unpadding algorithm is not well implemented, or that a non-deterministic padding algorithm is deployed.

A CryptoPP::InvalidArgument exception is thrown if running the code above with the following text:
Blowfish/GCM: block size of underlying block cipher is not 16

But when running the code instead with the block mode EAX, no exception is thrown. So my questions are:

Does GCM only work with AES? Can GCM also be used with Blowfish or 3DES?
Is there a matrix available which lists all possible combinations of symmetric algorithms with block modes?
Or is this a bug in Crypto++? Because the method BlockSize() always returns 0 but the exception is only raised if using Blowfish (or 3DES) instead of AES. This seems to raise the exception mentioned.

","GCM has been designed to work with 128-bit (=16 byte) block size only. You can find this in the original paper in Section 5.1.
Blowfish is a 64-bit block size algorithm, so the two are not compatible as an ""out-of-the-box"" authenticated encryption combination. The same is true for 3DES. The exception is not a bug in Crypto++.
GCM will work with other Crypto++ objects that have 128-bit block sizes. They include AES, Cast-256, Rijndael Cameilla, MARS, Serpent and Twofish. A table of the block sizes is available at Applied Crypto++: Block Ciphers.
GCM will not work with larger block sizes either. For example, Rijndael (the parent of AES) offers 192-bit and 256-bit block sizes (AES only specifies the 128-bit block size). GCM will not work with the larger block sizes. And the same is true for SHACAL-2, with a 256-bit block size.
Crypto++'s BlockSize() sometimes returns 0 (it has to do with the template parameters). Instead, use the compile time constants like AES::BLOCKSIZE, Camellia::BLOCKSIZE and Rijndael::BLOCKSIZE. This could be considered a bug.

Cryptodev (http://cryptodev-linux.org/index.html) looks bit like out-of-tree driver, not included into standard kernel (empty search for http://lxr.free-electrons.com/ident?i=crypto_run or http://lxr.free-electrons.com/ident?i=cryptodev). It should be downloaded, built and installed by user (slide 10 of https://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/lcj-2014-crypto-user.pdf#page=10 ""Out of kernel tree code (for years)""). They also claim on their website ""Support for all major cipher and hash algorithms"" so, it may use hardware crypto accelerator, but will work for any supported algorithm with software implementation when there is no hardware (there is always some crypto which is not implemented by any hardware).

So, if I need crypto support in Linux, and does not have hw support , will the userspace API (for AF_ALG and cryptodev) still work?
  If yes - does it mean they use software algorithm in kernel?

Yes, both methods will work without any HW crypto, and will use all software implementations available in the kernel (enabled at time when kernel was built).

Using the first key, encrypt your plaintext. Using the second key, decrypt that value. Using the third key, encrypt the value for your full block. It looks like this:
Encrypt(k3, Decrypt(k2, Encrypt(k1, plaintext)))
Decryption is the other way around and looks like this:
Decrypt(k1, Encrypt(k2, Decrypt(k3, ciphertext)))
When you encrypt your blocks with 3DES you then need to apply your mode of operation like CBC or CTR and apply padding if needed.
Be careful.

"10246083","Emulate 3DES EDE using only DES","My device doesn't support full 3DES (EDE). How can I emulate one using standard DES? Encryption mode is CBC.
","Block mode encryption
What you do is that you split the key of size 128 bit (16 byte) or 168 bit (24 byte) in two or three pieces respectively. So for a 16 byte key K you would have two keys Ka and Kb, and for a 24 byte key you would have Ka, Kb and Kc. DES ABC keys have an effective strength of about 112 bits, DES ABA keys have an effective strength of about 80 bits.
To encrypt a single block of 8 bytes (the block size of both DES and 3DES) you would perform the following cryptographic operation: Cn = E(Ka, D(Kb, E(Kc, Mn))) where Mn is the n'th block of the plain text message and Cn the n'th block of the cipher text. If you don't have a Kc then you may use Ka (DES ABC key vs DES ABA key).
For this you need a single block DES encrypt, which is identical to a single block encrypt in ECB mode, or a single block encrypt with CBC and an IV consisting of 8 bytes valued 00h.
CBC
So that's the block encryption sorted, now you need some kind of encryption mode and padding mode. I'll explain CBC mode encryption here, ECB should not be used for encryption non-random data.
With CBC mode encryption you XOR a vector to the plain text. The vector is normally just the output of the last DESede encrypted block. As you don't have any preceding cipher text, you need to create the first vector yourself using random data. This vector is called the initialization vector or IV. See wikipedia for a clear picture.
Padding
Block cipher modes only allow full blocks of plain text to be encrypted. So you would need some kind of padding scheme. Although there are many padding modes, PKCS#5 padding is used most of the time. You should pad the plain text like this: pad with bytes valued 0Xh, where X is the number of padding bytes required to create a full block. X should be between 1 and 8: in other words, PKCS#5 padding is always used; this makes it possible to distinquish the padding bytes from the plain text.
If you use padding in an online protocol then you need to protect against padding oracle attacks. In this case it is highly recommended to use some form of integrity checks, e.g. by adding a HMAC over the cipher text using a separate key.

Please suggest how i can achieve this.
Encryption and decryption should be done through a private key.
Hoping, my question is clear. Please confirm if i need to provide more information.
","Note that it is probably wiser to crypt and decrypt your data directly in your application rather than in the database.
You can use Oracle's DBMS_CRYPTO package. There is an example in the middle of the documentation page.
First you need to make a package to access the cipher type from SQL expression. Let's say you want AES256 in CBC mode with padding:
CREATE PACKAGE pkg_so_42979606
AS
    FUNCTION cipher_type RETURN PLS_INTEGER;
END pkg_so_42979606;
/
CREATE PACKAGE BODY pkg_so_42979606
AS
    ctype CONSTANT PLS_INTEGER := DBMS_CRYPTO.ENCRYPT_AES256
                                  + DBMS_CRYPTO.CHAIN_CBC
                                  + DBMS_CRYPTO.PAD_PKCS5;
    FUNCTION cipher_type RETURN PLS_INTEGER
    IS
    BEGIN
        RETURN ctype;
    END;
END pkg_so_42979606;
/

Then you will need a key. You can ask Oracle to generate one. To easily handle it I'll move it in Base64. Let's draw one:
DECLARE
    key_bytes_raw RAW(32);
    key_char NVARCHAR2(64);
BEGIN
    key_bytes_raw := DBMS_CRYPTO.RANDOMBYTES(32);
    key_char := UTL_I18N.RAW_TO_CHAR(UTL_ENCODE.BASE64_ENCODE(key_bytes_raw), 'AL32UTF8');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Key: ' || key_char);
END;
/
Key: pMV3D4xhyfNxp3YyfLWzAErGcKkIjK3X6uc/WIeVTls=

Thus the cipher key I'll use is pMV3D4xhyfNxp3YyfLWzAErGcKkIjK3X6uc/WIeVTls=.
Now I'll use a test table
CREATE TABLE so_42979606 (
    id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    data NVARCHAR2(2000));

You can insert encrypted data:
INSERT INTO so_42979606
    VALUES (1,
            DBMS_CRYPTO.ENCRYPT(UTL_I18N.STRING_TO_RAW('My clear data', 'AL32UTF8'),
                                pkg_so_42979606.cipher_type(),

And retrieve the encrypted data in clear.
SELECT id, UTL_I18N.RAW_TO_NCHAR(DBMS_CRYPTO.DECRYPT(data,
                                    pkg_so_42979606.cipher_type(),

How can we use this Key to encrypt data? Can we Create a KeyStore from the KeySafe generated Key?
I have found sample by creating blank keystore and creating new key from java code and saving in the keystore, But could not find anything on the KeySafe. Generating new Key from the java code is not feasible for us.
","nCipher keys have an app type that identifies which one of the supported APIs they were generated for.  Keys for the JCE provider have app type jcecsp.  KeySafe can't generate jcecsp keys, so you probably have one of type simple or pkcs11 or something.  You have several options: 

If you have a pkcs11 key, you can use the SunPKCS11 Provider that comes with your JDK to access PKCS#11 slots as a KeyStore.  Google for this provider and contact Thales Support for some hints on configuration language.  
If your key is not pkcs11 and you want to go the above route, you can retarget your key to pkcs11.  I actually don't know if KeySafe can do this but the command-line utility generatekey can.
You can use the Pure Java nCore and NFKM APIs to access your key directly regardless of app type.  If you have the CipherTools SDK you'll find ample sample code.
Once loaded by the native API, you can convert the loaded key Object to an JCE Key Object which you can store in an nCipher.sworld KeyStore.  There is an Interop example in the CipherTools sample code that hints at how you might do this.  
If the actual key is not of value to you (meaning you're willing to generate another one to get started) use Java's KeyTool to generate your key directly in the context of an nCipher.sworld KeyStore through the nCipherKM Provider.  The product manual shows how to correctly invoke KeyTool.  You don't even need the SDK for this.  

Contact Thales Support if you run into any issues.

"12301485","RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider implementation vs RSACryptoServiceProvider c#","If RSACryptoServiceProvider cannot Encrypt data larger than it's KeySize, how RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider is implemented in the .Net framework?
I am working on a utility that is going to be used to encrypt/decrypt some sensitive information. My two encryption provider options are DPAPI and RSA, while DPAPI not suited for web farm kind of environment, RSA is fits because of the Export/Import options with a KeyContainer. This is a stand alone application running on a workstation.
As I am aware that Asymmetric algorithms are not designed for large data, I just tried encrypting a string of length over 400K using the code below and it works well.
        if (!section.SectionInformation.IsProtected)
        {
            section.SectionInformation.ProtectSection(""RSAProtectedConfigurationProvider"");
            section.SectionInformation.ForceSave = true;
            config.Save(ConfigurationSaveMode.Full);
        }

Definitely this implies that more things are happening behind the scenes apart from the export import key options in aspnet_regiis.exe. 
My understanding:

we encrypt myapp.exe.config with RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider, provide a key container name myrsakeycontainer, and export the public and private keys to an xml file myrsakeyfile.xml.
If we want myapp.exe.config to be decrypted in another computer, we import they keypair from myrsakeyfile.xml with a container named myrsakeycontainer.

this works well. I can achieve the same thing in my project via RSACryptoServiceProvider. But I can't handle data that larger than the key size that 
  new RSACryptoServiceProvider(cspParameters)
generated for me.

I want to be able to decrypt huge data (just in case) just the way
RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider does.
Yes I could use a RijndaelManaged (my favorite) for actual 
encryption and for the symmetric key transport (export/import) I
could use the RSACryptoServiceProvider. This leaves me in a
situation that If I want to export/import the symmetric key, I should
first encrypt it with the public key or RSA, import it to another
machine, decrypt with the private key of RSA. Which is export the RSA
key pair along with the encrypted symmetric key. 
But, when I export RSA key pair used by
RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider via aspnet_regiis.exe, I
believe that it exports only the public/private key pair in an xml
file and no other information (like the symmetric key information).
So, with just the RSA key pair, how does
RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider manage to derypt (huge - over
400K chars in my case) information that was encrypted on another
computer? In cases it uses a symmetric algorithm (perhaps?!) to
encrypt information, how is that symmetric key exported/imported to another
computer for decryption? Is that symmetric key part of the RSA key container exported via aspnet_regiis.exe or is the symmetric key is contrived dynamic based on an algorithm?
I could get away with a Rijndael, whose key is encrypeted with an RSA
key pair and I can export/import both the RSA key pair and the
Rijndael symmetric key to another computer. (which I have done in the past)
I am interested to know what is used inside
RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider. 

Any theories? concepts? links? recommendations? please..

Similar Question - What algorithms are used by RSAProtectedConfigurationProvider in web.config encyrption?

","The encrypted symmetric key is stored in the XML alongside the encrypted configuration information that the symmetric key has encrypted.
If you use Reflector to look at the code, what it does is load the XML node and use the asymmetric RSA private key to decrypt a symmetric key stored within the XML node itself.
The function that actually does this magic is here:
public virtual SymmetricAlgorithm GetDecryptionKey(EncryptedData encryptedData, string symmetricAlgorithmUri);
Declaring Type: System.Security.Cryptography.Xml.EncryptedXml 
Assembly: System.Security, Version=2.0.0.0 
See the code around  
this.m_document.SelectNodes(""//enc:EncryptedKey"", nsmgr);

This blog post has a nice writeup about how you pair Asymmetric and Symmetric algorithms in real-world practice: http://pages.infinit.net/ctech/20031101-0151.html

"22594827","Blowfish encryption algorithm explained","I have hard times implementing blowfish encryption algorythm. 
Could someone explain to me,
if this is the function where the encrypting happens: 
 void encrypt (uint32_t & L, uint32_t & R) {
    for (int i=0 ; i<16 ; i += 2) {
       L ^= P[i];
       R ^= f(L);
       R ^= P[i+1];
       L ^= f(R);
    }
    L ^= P[16];
    R ^= P[17];
    swap (L, R);
 }

so how would a function like this would look like: 
/**
*
* @param string text this is the text to be encrypted
* @return string this is encrypted text 
*/
string EncryptBlowfish(string text){
    //something happens here
}

","Generally, you should review the existing encryption library interfaces and the theoretical description of Blowfish to get a better understanding how these implementation have been done before, including the design of the interface. To design a good interface you need to source a decent a number of use cases for your code, and in the absence of that data sample, unique to your case, you should fall back to the already common wisdom.
For instance, take a look at crypto++ page for blowfish (and scroll down to the end of the page to skip streams and filters where it shows usage of an encryptor that can be fed individual bytes).
Taking that example forward, your code can look like this:
class StatefulBlowfish {    
private:
   BlowfishKey key_;
   BlowfishIv iv_;
public:    
void EncryptCBC(string text, /*out*/ byte*){
   for (int i=0; I < text.size(); i++) {
      // process and xor an individual ‘(byte)text[i]’ the 
      // necessary number of rounds. Consider padding.
  }
  ...    
}

But such a class isn’t very generic and has a lot of fixed parts which can make it harder to test, use and maintain. Another important thing to consider is that the interface that you have to design isn’t restricted to taking a string to encrypt, as you suggest in the question, but rather have to account for the chaining mode, the key and the iv – they are best to be created and managed elsewhere, to adhere to single responsibility principle. 
You should also strive to have arrays or pointers to arrays of bytes as the interface of your low-level encryptor methods, because this is how the algorithm operates, and ideally the serialisation from a string to an array of bytes (and vice versa) should be offloaded to a separate interface. (Consider for example the assumptions on a “string” between big and little endian architectures, or the requirements on padding.)
A good generic OOP design is on one hand a collection of encryption ""parts"" each having more or less a single responsibility (serialisation, padding, chaining mode, key initialisation, key schedule, etc) and on the other hand a good design admits an easy creation of a bigger chain of responsibility construct, that describes the intention from simply observing the code. 
Coming full circle back to cryptopp, modifying a standard code example for a slightly better clarity, look how everything is handled separately:
// a key is created, to be separately initialised with a PRNG
// or from a secure source, hardware TRNG, etc.
SecByteBlock key(Blowfish::DEFAULT_KEYLENGTH); 
...
// an iv is created, similarly to be separately initialised with a PRNG
byte iv[Blowfish::BLOCKSIZE]; 
...
// Wrap blowfish low-level implementation in a CBC chaining mode 
// and initialise it with the key and iv    
CBC_Mode<Blowfish>::Encryption e; 
e.SetKeyWithIV(key, key.size(), iv);    
...    
// have a separate padding wrapper
... new StreamTransformationFilter(e, /*out*/ cipher)

","Create a secret key and store it on the server. If there are multiple servers and requests aren't guaranteed to come back to the same server; you'll need to use the same key on every server. This key should be rotated periodically.
If you encrypt the data in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode (See the Crypt::CBC module), the overhead of encryption is at most two blocks (one for the IV and one for padding). 128 bit (i.e. 16 byte) blocks are common, but not universal. I recommend using AES (aka Rijndael) as the block cipher.
You need to authenticate the data to ensure it hasn't been modified. Depending on the security of the application, just hashing the message and including the hash in the plaintext that you encrypt may be good enough. This depends on attackers being unable to change the hash to match the message without knowing the symmetric encryption key. If you're using 128-bit keys for the cipher, use a 256-bit hash like SHA-256 (you can use the Digest module for this). You may also want to include some other things like a timestamp in the data to prevent the request from being repeated multiple times.

my $cu = $c->model('CryptUtil');

","I see three steps here.  First, try compressing the data.  With so little data bzip2 might save you maybe 5-20%.   I'd throw in a guard to make sure it doesn't make the data larger.  This step may not be worth while.
use Compress::Bzip2 qw(:utilities);
$data = memBzip $data;

You could also try reducing the length of any keys and values in the data manually.  For example, first_name could be reduced to fname.
Second, encrypt it.  Pick your favorite cipher and use Crypt::CBC.  Here I use Rijndael because its good enough for the NSA.  You'll want to do benchmarking to find the best balance between performance and security.
use Crypt::CBC;
my $key = ""SUPER SEKRET"";
my $cipher = Crypt::CBC->new($key, 'Rijndael');
my $encrypted_data = $cipher->encrypt($data);

You'll have to store the key on the server.  Putting it in a protected file should be sufficient, securing that file is left as an exercise.  When you say you can't store anything on the server I presume this doesn't include the key.
Finally, Base 64 encode it.  I would use the modified URL-safe base 64 which uses - and _ instead of + and / saving you from having to spend space URL encoding these characters in the base 64 string.  MIME::Base64::URLSafe covers that.
use MIME::Base64::URLSafe;
my $safe_data = urlsafe_b64encode($encrypted_data);

Then stick it onto the URL however you want.  Reverse the process for reading it in.
You should be safe on size.  Encrypting will increase the size of the data, but probably by less than 25%.  Base 64 will increase the size of the data by a third (encoding as 2^6 instead of 2^8).  This should leave encoding 500 bytes comfortably inside 1K.

Is there any way around this - i.e. creating a certificate with this password and then referring to the certificate instead?
Would this certificate have to be purchased (like SSL), or can I create my own?
Is this method scalable across fail-over clustered databases, i.e. the encryption is not based on the machine, only the password provided. Therefore failover can still read the passwords

The main goal of using a dynamic IV is that two consecutive encryptions of the same file won't result in the same encrypted value.

can you guys tell me if the other end knows what algorithm I am using can they not extract the key and decrypt it ?

No. The whole point of standardized encryption algorithms (as opposed to those that rely on obscurity) is that even though everyone knows all details of it, one cannot decrypt it unless one has the key.
This approach works because the only way to crack the encryption is to try all possible keys, of which there are too many. As computation power increases, formerly ""secure"" algorithms do become ""unsecure"". With some algorithms there may also be flaws that allow other forms of deductions to take place that significantly reduce the possible key-space and hence speed up these brute-force attacks. But (as far as we know) Blowfish is safe here.
Keeping the key secret is essential of course. If your program also includes the key (as opposed to asking the user or some device for it, or using random session keys that are themselves encrypted using public-key crypto), then a reverse-engineer can probably find it and break your scheme.
An important part of keeping the key secret is to keep it ""non-guessable"" and to not reuse it for different purposes. Randomly generated keys are the best.
Also, by ""the other end"" you mean an attacker, right? Usually, ""the other end"" refers to Bob The Intended Recipient, and he of course needs to be able to decrypt the message.

","It is to my understanding, that one of the whole points of picking a particular encryption, and decryption, method, is that both ends of the communication stream will know which algorithm the data is encrypted with.
If you ""have to"" encrypt your data using the Blowfish algorithm, then the requirement alone should tell you that the recipient is expecting a message encrypted using the Blowfish scheme.
Like Thilo said, ""the whole point of standardized encryption algorithms...is that even though everyone knows all the details of it, one cannot decrypt it unless one has the key.""
The best way to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, and other attacks involving the malicious party intercepting your messages, is to keep your key safe - do not hard-code it into any programs (even compiled programs can be analyzed) and build trusts with your recipient by ensuring that their security practices minimize the chance of a malicious agent procuring the pertinent key. Alternately, if your recipient supports it, you could use ""one-time pads"" - unique passwords/keys for encrypting your data.

Now suppose you want to decrypt some string in python encrypted in php. First do b64decode and then decrypt the result.
Remember to pad your data such that the len is divisible by 16. 

Happy encrypting and decrypting!!!

","You can use CAPICOM from a 32-bit process on a 64-bit machine (obviously). If you are using it from script, you have to use the 32-bit versions of cscript.exe and wscript.exe. I.e:

c:\windows\sysWOW64\cscript.exe ""c:\path\to\another\vbscript.vbs""

This works fine, I am doing it in production right now.

1) Upon encrypting and then decrypting a file, I am getting extra garbage at the end of my files, and it is different depending on the file. A hex dump of one original file and the result after an encryption and decryption had and extra ""0B 0B 0B 0B 0B 0B 0B 0B 0B 0B 0B"" another file had an extra ""05 05 05 05 05"" at the end.  A diff at the command line for both resultant files reports ""No newline at end of file"".  Other than these problems (and problems working with the files relating to these problems like NSJSONSerialization refusing to parse) everything appears to be working.  What is causing this frustrating problem?
2) In order to eventually accommodate very large files I have broken up files into chunks and then used the last 16bytes of the previous chunk to as the IV for the next (since this is the way CBC works anyway, right?). Strangely, on chunks divisible by the key size, using kCCOption PKCS7Padding is causing problems. So that the IV ends up not being the same when decrypting as encrypting between these chunks. When I just set the options to zero for all the chunks including the last which is likely not to be divisible by the key size, I get an exception.  Can anyone help me understand what this issue is? I just use a condition to avoid the issue, but I don't understand the exception, and perhaps it relates to question 1.

","The extra bytes are the PKCS#7 padding. Encryption is block based so bytes must be added on encryption and later removed on decryption to achieve this. Per PKCS#7 the extra bytes are the number of bytes added. These additional bytes: ""05 05 05 05 05"" indicate 5 bytes of padding were added.
If PKCS#7 padding is specified and the input data is an exact multiple of the block size another block is added (and will be all padding bytes). This must be sent of there will be padding errors on decryption. If you know on both encryption and decryption that the data is a multiple of the block size you can skip PKCS#7 padding. In the OP's case this could be skipped on all encryption segments except the last if the intermediate segments were all a multiple of block size. AES uses 128-bit (16-byte) blocks.

    }
    println(""Error: \(operationResult)"")
    return nil
}

","Thanks to the help of Zaph I have understood the above issues.  For clarity I will answer the above questions more directly.
1) As Zaph said the extra bytes on my decrypted files were padding. They were showing up because of the following offending code, which I have removed.
var options: CCOptions
if dataLength % UInt(const.keyLength) != 0 {
    options = UInt32(kCCOptionPKCS7Padding)
} else {
    options = 0
}

Since the output of CCCrypt will always be divisible by the key length if the PKCS7Padding option is chosen (that's why they are added), the above code would test for a condition that could never be met during a decryption operation. CCCrypt would then not strip the padding back off for me. Since in my application I was mostly handling sub pieces of a file that were always a fixed multiple of the key size and not entire files, I was trying to remove the unecessary padding between files using the above code not considering the ramifications in a decryption operation. This of course is more appropriately done in the code that calls my NSData extension.
2) As per the man page (there isn't one for ios but an old mac one from 2007 can be found here: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/CCCrypt.3cc.html
""if padding is disabled, or when decrypting, the total number of bytes [has] to be aligned to the block size; otherwise CCCryptFinal() will return kCCAlignmentError.""
This means that when I set options to zero (didn't set the PKCS7Padding option), the last block would cause the program to crash.
Since I was breaking the file up into sub pieces for my encryption and decryption operation (to eventually accommodate for very large file sizes) I needed to use the last 16 bytes of the previous file chunk as the IV for the next chunk (this is how CBC works, by seeding each subsequent key sized block with an IV generated from the last 16 bytes of the previous block (irregardless of whether 128bit or 256bit key size is used as pointed out by Zaph above).
However, what I failed to understand is that CCCrypt ALWAYS provides padding when encrypting if the PKCSPadding option is chosen, even when the data operated on is a multiple of the key size. CCCrypt was adding 16 bytes to the end of every chunk of the file, and then I was writing that padding in the middle of files.  Ooops.
I'm now using the following code to call the encryption/decryption method, and discarding the padding for method calls on data that does not run to the end of the file at this more appropriate level.
while file != nil {
    if let inputBuffer = file?.readDataOfLength(fileChunkLength) { 
        if inputBuffer.length == 0 {
            file?.closeFile()
            break 
        } else { 
            println(""input buffer length: \(inputBuffer.length)"") 
            println(""IV passed to aes128:\(iv)"") 
            if let outputBuffer = inputBuffer.AES128CBC(key: key, iv: iv, encryptionOp: encrypt) { 
                println(""output bufferlength: \(outputBuffer.length)"")

                if encrypt && file?.offsetInFile < fileSize {
                    // only write the data, and discard the padding when not at the end of the file
                    outFile?.writeData(outputBuffer.subdataWithRange(NSMakeRange(0, fileChunkLength)))
                    println(""Bytes written \(fileChunkLength)"")
                    // set the iv for the next chunk in encryption ops (no need when file is finished anyway)
                    iv = outputBuffer.subdataWithRange(NSMakeRange(fileChunkLength - ivLength, ivLength))
                } else {
                    outFile?.writeData(outputBuffer)
                    println(""Bytes written \(outputBuffer.length)"")
                    // set iv for decryption ops (doesn't matter for encryption ops where file is at end)

"28108843","triple DES result length","If I encrypt emails so that I can store them in a database, the resulting string is longer than the email itself.  Is there a maximum length to this resulting coded string?  if so, does it depend on both key length and the email length?  I need to know this so I can set my database fields to the correct length.
Thanks.
","As Alex K. notes, for block ciphers (like DES), common modes will pad them out to a multiple of the block size. The block size for 3DES is 64-bits (8 bytes). The most common padding scheme is PKCS7, which pads the block with ""n x n bytes."" This is to say, if you need one bytes of padding, it pads with 0x01. If you need four bytes of padding, it pads with 0x04040404 (4x 4s). If your data is already the right length, it pads with a full block (8 bytes of 0x08 for 3DES).
The short version is that the padded cipher text for 3DES can be up to 8 bytes longer than the plaintext. If your encryption scheme is a typical, insecure implementation, this is the length. The fact that you're using 3DES (an obsolete cipher) makes it a bit more likely that it's also insecurely implemented, and so this is the answer.
But if your scheme is implemented well, then there could be quite a few other things attached to the message. There could be 8 bytes of initialization vector. There could be a salt of arbitrary length if you're using a password. There could be an HMAC. There could be lots of things that could add an arbitrary amount of space. (The RNCryptor format, for example, adds up to 82 bytes to the message.) So you need to know how your format is implemented.

This is what I understand for SSL communication. The browser gets public key from the web server of the secured website.

Well, it gets the entire certificate, which contains the public key, and it gets a lot of other things too, that authenticate that the server owns that certificate, and therefore owns that public key.

The client and server establish session key based on public/private keys

Incorrect. They negotiate a session key based on shared secrets that don't have anything to do with the public or private keys. The public key may be used to encrypt one of those secrets between client and server, but that's a different statement.

and then continue communication through symmetric algorithm during the SSL session.

Correct.

My questions:
After session key is generated, where does it stored in server side? Is it stored in web server memory?

Of course.

@Mark Setchell Thank you for bc command. I did man bc and leaned alot. It was important to note the diferences between '^' parsing. Like with '$' Theres ambiguous definitions. So with C ^ means ""XOR"" and not ""to the power of ....""
And $ is sometimes used for strings or variables but in bash it invokes the bash command test out the differences between $0 and $(0)
Notes: At At 0000040 000a  thats my line feed ""Enter Key"". Also note the output of hexdump is lowercase you can use tr to translate. On two's complement its the XOR(x) = 
Disclaimer:
Different environments can overload ^ and $ ""operator"" command for different results.
This experimental command has a problem with refreshing stdin see man xxd :
a=FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF && b=5555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555 && bc -l logic.bc <<< ""obase=16;ibase=16;xor($a,$b)"" && echo $a | xxd -l 32 -ps -c 64 && echo ""Below are the A and then B inputs"" && echo $a && echo $b

This outputs bc results to  xxd and prints $a in between the commands $a temporarily for some reason  perhaps $(0) related injections xxd outputs 46 no 41 HEX ascii for A using -u with xxd seems to make no difference:

","As others have said, the issue you're facing is that the output of the xor is being truncated to 64-bits. You could still do it in the shell, you'd just need to break the arithmetic up into 64-bit chunks. I recently did this for kicks:
xor() {
  {
    echo ""${1}"" | # start pipeline with first parameter
      fold -w 16 | # break into 16 char lines (note: 4-bit hex char * 16 = 64 bits)
      sed 's/^/0x/' | # prepend '0x' to lines to tell shell their hex numbers
      nl # number the lines (we do this to match corresponding ones)
    echo ""${2}"" | # do all the same to the second parameter
      fold -w 16 | 
      sed 's/^/0x/' | 
      nl
  } | # coming into this pipe we have lines: 1,...,n,1,...,n 
  sort -n | # now sort so lines are: 1,1,...,n,n
  cut -f 2 | # cut to keep only second field (blocks), ditching the line numbers
  paste - - | # paste to join every-other line with tabs (now two-field lines)
  while read -r a b; do # read lines, assign 'a' and 'b' to the two fields 
    printf ""%#0${#a}x"" ""$(( a ^ b ))"" # do the xor and left-pad the result
  done |
  sed 's/0x//g' | # strip the leading '0x' (here for clarity instead of in the loop)
  paste -s -d '\0' - # join all the blocks back into to a big hex string
}

Example:
$ xor ""0c60c80f961f0e71f3a9b524af6012062fe037a6"" ""e60cc942513261fd3eb76c0e617d53f6f73ebef1""
ea6c014dc72d6f8ccd1ed92ace1d41f0d8de8957

This is a comically slow way to xor some big numbers, but for demos it should be fine. I used it in a PBKDF2 implementation where it reduced the output of 4096 rounds of HMAC SHA512 in a minute or so (concurrently with the hashing).

","A more object oriented approach would be:
Create an algorithm interface to be displayed in your combo box:
public interface IAlgorithmItem
{
    SymmetricAlgorithm CreateAlgorithm();

    string DisplayName { get; }
}

Then, create a new class for each desired algorithm:
public class AesAlgorithm : IAlgorithmItem
{
    public AesAlgorithm()
    {
    }

    public SymmetricAlgorithm CreateAlgorithm()
    {
        return Aes.Create();
    }

    public string DisplayName
    {
        get { return ""AES""; }
    }
}

public class RijndaelAlgorithm : IAlgorithmItem
{
    public SymmetricAlgorithm CreateAlgorithm()
    {
        return Rijndael.Create(); 
    }

    public string DisplayName
    {
        get { return ""Rijndael""; }
    }
}

// ...

Then, you can create a new list of items:
var listItems = new List<IAlgorithmItem>() { new AesAlgorithm(), new RijndaelAlgorithm() };

Then you can bind your combo box to this list:
comboBox1.DataSource = listItems;
comboBox1.DisplayMember = ""DisplayName"";

Later, you can reference the selected item:
var algorithmItem = (IAlgorithmItem)comboBox1.SelectedItem;
var algorithm = algorithmItem.CreateAlgorithm();

EDIT: Updated with Will's suggestion of using an interface rather than an abstract base class.
EDIT 2: Updated to use a create method rather than property, as the result of the operation will create a new algorithm each time it is accessed.

","Well, my first inclination was to give you Wikipedia links to the factory method and abstract factory patterns (there, I did it still), but since you say you're a beginner, let's not bring out the big guns upfront.
Basically, what you need is to find a common trait of all encryption algorithms and create a method that will return an object instance that has this common trait. The manifestation of such a trait can be either an abstract class or an interface in C#, and you're in luck, all your selected encryptions derive from SymmetricAlgorithm (""luck"" is probably an insult to the designers of System.Security.Cryptography, but I'm sure they'd forgive me for the sake of illustration ;).
So, just refactor your code by introducing a new method, possibly along these lines:
private SymmetricAlgorithm GetAlgorithm(int index)
{
  switch (index)
  {
    case 0:
      return Aes.Create();
    case 1:
      return DES.Create();
    case 2:
      return Rijndael.Create();
    default:
      throw new NotSupportedException(""unknown algorithm"");
  }
}

You can easily figure out how to use this new method from the rest of your code.

But this process doesn't work for my needs...
I have a windows service written in C# that needs to connect to other remote machines in different datacenters using specific service accounts. These service accounts are like domain user accounts, but there is no real people behind them and they just have the proper permissions to carry out the service payload on each specific server. The service acount information is stored in a SQL Server table including the password for each account. Currently, I am using symmetric encryption (Rijndael) to obfuscate the passwords in the DB table. The key is saved in a separate config file that has strict access permissions.
Every time the service has a scheduled payload to run on a remote machine, I lookup the appropriate service account information on the table and decript it using the key. There is also a internal website that is basically a front-end for managing the various settings for this service, and in there the admin can view and change the password of the service accounts.
Is this a good approach to keeping things secure? Are there any obvious flaws in this scheme?

There is also a back end to the website for administration, so naturally all application data being pushed and pulled from the webservice to the silverlight administration back end must also be encrypted. 
Silverlight does not support asymmetric encryption, which would work for the public website.

My final alternative would be then to implement the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, which supports symmetric encryption by means of key agreement. However Diffie-Hellman is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. In other words, there is no guarantee that either side is sure of each others identity, making it possible for communication to be intercepted and altered without the receiving party knowing about it.

I found an RSA implementation i can use in Silverlight. It seems pretty safe to use this to encrypt the handshake for the  DiffieHellman key agreement between the Silverlight client and PHP web service, and subsequently also use it to encrypt the symmetric key that was agreed upon (which is itself generated from the result of the key exchange by hashing it). 
After this I'm pretty much guaranteed that all communication going to the web service has not been intercepted, modified and then retransmitted (MITM). However I believe it is still possible; technically, for an attacker to impersonate the silverlight client and send messages to the webservice (assuming they discover the url). 
Security from unauthorized access is provided since the attacker does not know the ""secret api"" of my custom webservice, hence they are unable to communicate with it. 
The only way to break this would be to brute force the webservice with whatever strings an attacker may suspect to be valid to try and get a response from the web service. I don't think you can brute force a variable length string. It sounds impractical.

","SSL/TLS suffers from the same problem that any Diffie-Hellman-based implementation you come up with would have, in that it can still be broken by a man-in-the-middle attack.
The reason TLS is secure and trusted is because the client, when receiving the server's certificate, authenticates it by checking that it is signed with another certificate from a known trusted identity - say, VeriSign. Thus far, this makes it impossible to enact a man-in-the-middle attack without having VeriSign's private key - when the interloper sends a fake certificate proclaiming to be the server, the client would easily detect that this certificate is not signed using the trusted identity's certificate, and bails out of the connection, displaying a warning to the user.
For your purposes, it's likely easiest to use TLS. To make it secure, you would generate a certificate for your server, and then embed in your client the public key for that certificate. The client can then verify that it is talking to your server, without having to expose the private key, which you don't have to distribute.
EDIT: In response to your comment on Jerry's answer, if your hosting provider doesn't allow SSL/TLS connections at all, preventing a man-in-the-middle attack will be tricky. If this is your only reason for avoiding TLS, I would suggest getting your provider to turn it on, or finding a provider that allows for it.
EDIT: In response to your edited question: even if you're now using RSA in your Silverlight client to send data to your web service, you cannot guarantee that the client itself has not been modified. It's quite possible for an attacker to dig into your client, determine the algorithm you're using to perform the encryption/handshake, and then write code to impersonate your client (or indeed, modify the client to include their code). Once they've done that, they can start analyzing your API and use it to make calls to your web service.
It's the same with SSL/TLS - the client can validate the identity of the host using the host's certificate, and as long as the host's server is secured, the client can trust the output from the host; however, there is no mechanism in which the host can 100% validate that the client is who they say they are, as the client will be run on a machine which does not have a controlled execution environment.
However - despite the above being true, and that it's possible that an attacker can compromise your system in this way, it's likely not probable -- unless you're working on a public-facing system that attracts a lot of attention/use, or a system that deals directly with money in some form, the attacker needs to make some effort before being able to send their own input to your web service.
Your best bet is to validate the input received by your web service thoroughly, and don't leave dangling APIs accessible that your regular client would never use.

","I recommend starting with this JavaScript+PHP DH key Exchange protocol:
http://enanocms.org/News:Article/2008/02/20/Diffie_Hellman_key_exchange_implemented
You can then re-write the javascript in silverlight.  I recommend using Wireshark to dump packets then you can use Meld or whatever to diff the packets to see where your implementation is differs from the original. 
Good Luck!

I would then like it to be an option that, if you have the encryption key, you would be able to decrypt it using MySQL's AES_DECRYPT() function.  This seems like it should be possible, since AES_DECRYPT is an implementation of AES/Rijndael.
The MySQL AES_ENCRYPT/DECRYPT functions simply take a key and the string to encrypt/decrypt as parameters.  The examples i've seen for encryption in ASP.NET/C#, however, involve also specifying values for Key and IV (initialization vector).  How do these affect the final, encrypted byte array, and how can they be taken into account when decrypting with AES_DECRYPT)_?
","You can do that by setting RijndaelManaged to use ECB mode.
However, ECB mode is not secure and should be avoided.

In general, a database is a very bad place to perform encryption.
If you are able to encrypt your data in the database, that implies that you have both the ciphertext and the key in the same place; this defeats the purpose of encryption.
You should keep the key as far away from ciphertext storage as possible; using any sort of SQL encryption function is usually indicative of a fundamental design flaw in your encryption strategy which can have disastrous consequences.

"28243879","Chunking AES symmetric encryption","Use case 1 (working baseline):
Use case one is straightforward and is implemented / working.

In Java, Write a stream to disk in a single fell swoop. 
Wrap output stream with symmetric cipher so that contents on disk are encrypted.
Later, read from disk. Wrap input stream with same symmetric cipher
in a single fell swoop so that contents retrieved from input stream
are plaintext and match original.

Use case 2 (no suitable solution determined):

In Java, Write a stream to disk.
Allow for subsequent bytes (""chunks"") to be appended to file.
Wrap output stream with symmetric cipher so that contents on disk are encrypted.
Use same cipher so that all chunks are encrypted in the same manner.
Later, read from disk. Wrap input stream with same symmetric cipher
in a single fell swoop so that contents retrieved from input stream
are plaintext and match original.

Problem statement:
Encrypting and decrypting ""abc"" does not yield the same result as encrypting and decrypting ""a"", ""b"", and ""c"" separately, and therefore the ""chunked"" file described in use case 2 will no be successfully decrypted.
// e.g.
decrypt(encrypt(""abc"")) != decrypt(encrypt(""a"") + encrypt(""b"") + encrypt(""c""))

The Actual Question:
... so the question is, how might one configure a Java cipher stream that can encrypt one chunk at a time, (a) without having prior knowledge of encrypted chunks, and (b) be decipherable using a single input stream cipher wrapper (without requiring knowledge of indexes where file was appended)...
","Unfortunately, in this case you can't have your cake and eat it too.
You must either

write some length bytes at the start of each chunk, or
use an encryption algorithm where decrypt(encrypt(""abc"")) == decrypt(encrypt(""a"") + encrypt(""b"") + encrypt(""c"")) (aka trivial, and not recommended)

Number 1 is definitely a better choice, and is easier than you might think. Details below.
Number 2, you could use something like a Vigenere cipher, which would allow you to decrypt the whole file in one fell swoop, but would be a compromise in terms of encryption strength.
Details on number 1
The way you would do this is by reserving, for instance, four bytes (a 32-bit integer) at the beginning of each chunk. This integer represents the length of the chunk. To decrypt you would therefore:

Read the first four bytes and convert to integer n.
Read the next n bytes and decrypt.
Read the next four bytes and convert to integer n.
Read the next n bytes, decrypt and append to the first decrypted chunk.
Repeat steps 3 and 4 until end of file is reached.

And obviously this makes the chunk encryption easy because all you have to do is first write how many encrypted bytes you're about to append.

} catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (NoSuchProviderException e) {

}
KeyPair pair = keyGen.generateKeyPair();
this.priv = pair.getPrivate();
this.pub = pair.getPublic();

I send the public key to the client. The client will make a Cipher using the server's public key. I want to use this Cipher to encrypt a SealedObject encapsulating the symmetric key created by the client and send it to the server. 
//create cipher using server's public key
Cipher cipher = null;
try {
    cipher = Cipher.getInstance(serverKey.getAlgorithm(), ""SUN"");
} catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {

}
try {

}

But when I run the program I have an exception when initializing the cipher:
java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException: No such algorithm: DSA
at javax.crypto.Cipher.getInstance(Cipher.java:646)
at javax.crypto.Cipher.getInstance(Cipher.java:568)

I don't understand why I get this NoSuchAlgorithm exception. I don't get this if I make a public key with RSA rather than DSA but RSA gives me:
javax.crypto.IllegalBlockSizeException: 
Data must not be longer than 117 bytes

So what am I supposed to use to securely send the sealed object containing my symmetric key?
","As @zapl comments, DSA is not an encryption algorithm, and RSA can only encrypt data with size less than the key size minus a small mostly-fixed overhead (11 bytes for PKCS1, which is the default and thus you used; somewhat more for OAEP).
Although not in your posted code, I'll bet the problem is you are trying to seal the SecretKey object. Encryption works only on byte (or bit) sequences, represented in Java by byte arrays or sometimes portions of arrays, so SealedObject actually serializes the object you give it to bytes and encrypts those bytes, and conversely decrypts those bytes and deserializes them to re-form the object. Java serialization has some overhead, and the various Key types in particular are organized in a hierarchy that exacerbates this. For example serializing a SecretKey from KeyGenerator.getInstance(""TDES"") is 282 bytes, much too large for RSA-1024 which as your exception says can only be 117 bytes.
Instead seal only the bytes of the key value obtained by SecretKey.getEncoded(). On the receiver (server) put the bytes back in a SecretKeySpec (with the correct algorithm; send that also if not fixed in advance) and you can actually use it as Key for symmetric even without running it through a factory (unlike asymmetric keys which have more structure). Even a simple byte[] has some serialization overhead, but not enough to cause a problem here.

"18219053","How can I create a shared-secret voucher code system between 2 independent servers?","Given this workflow:
Server A

User authenticates.
User purchases randomly generated unique voucher code using shared secret to use an application on on server B.

Server B

User authenticates.
User inputs voucher code.
Server B validates code is legitimate using shared secret
Server B grants access to the application.

I need a way in PHP to implement the functions generateVoucherCode and validateVoucherCode as shown below:
Server A
$voucher = generateVoucherCode(""someSharedSecret"");

Server B
$isValid = validateVoucherCode($userInputtedCode, ""someSharedSecret"");
if($isValid) {
    // allow access to application
}

","Validating legitimacy through a shared secret is what HMACs are for. You can generate a HMAC in PHP through hash_hmac. Your workflow would be:

Server A generates an one-use code (in any manner you want) and calculates its HMAC. The pair of code + HMAC is given to the user as a voucher code.
User presents voucher to server B.
Server B isolates the one-use code from the voucher and independently calculates its HMAC using the shared secret. If the calculated HMAC matches the one in the voucher then the voucher is genuine.

Example voucher generation:
$secret = '$uper$ecret$tring';
$code = 'a pet unicorn';
$voucher = $code.'/'.hash_hmac('sha512', $code, $secret);

echo 'Your voucher is '.$voucher';

Example voucher verification:
$secret = '$uper$ecret$tring';
list ($code, $hmac) = explode('/', $voucher);
$verify_hmac = hash_hmac('sha512', $code, $secret);
if ($hmac === $verify_hmac) {
    echo 'Your voucher can be redeemed for '.$code';

DROP TABLE #SampleBankAccounts

That seems to work fine, but now I need to take a variable e.g. @AccountNo and see if it matches any of the bank accounts we have stored (I'll use a stored procedure in all likelihood). I would much rather avoid decryption in any scripts if possible, so I wondered if it was possible to encrypt the @AccountNo variable and then compare it, so we might see a match:
DECLARE @MyTestBankAccount NVARCHAR(255) = '123456789'
DECLARE @MyEncryptedTestBankAccount VARBINARY(128)

OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY AccountNos_01
    DECRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE Employees_01;

SELECT @MyEncryptedTestBankAccount = ENCRYPTBYKEY(KEY_GUID('AccountNos_01'),@MyTestBankAccount)

SELECT
     AccountNumber
    ,EmployeeId
FROM Bank_Accounts
WHERE
    @MyEncryptedTestBankAccount = AccountNumber

This does not work; as you can see, I use an account number that should be present in the table, but no results are returned. I have tried to decrypt the account number column and compare it to the variable, but I get a load of Chinese characters coming out (much as in this question), and they do not match the characters created by encrypting and decrypting the variable, so that doesn't work for a match either...
So why does the following query (using data from above) not give me the encrypted and decrypted values for the account details? Can I use this method to search employee bank accounts against a given bank account?
OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY AccountNos_01
    DECRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE Employees_01;
SELECT
     AccountNumber                                  AS Encrypted_AccountNo
    ,EmployeeId                                     AS EmployeeId
    ,CONVERT(NVARCHAR,DECRYPTBYKEY(AccountNumber))  AS Decrypted_AccountNo
FROM Bank_Accounts

","Normally you would use counter mode encryption for this, but that seems unavailable for OpenSSL. With OpenSSL block ciphers you cannot just start encrypting/decrypting in the middle of the file. For CBC you need to know the previous encrypted block and insert that as the IV. If you encrypt them sequentially at the client you can then relatively easily decrypt them at the server.
Of course you may also encrypt each block separately and then concatenate the decrypted blocks together.

","You shouldn't rely on two-way encryption for passwords. If someone can get the cyphertext, they can usually also get the key to decrypt them.
Instead, you should use hashing or key derivation like blowfish or pbkdf2, those are one-way functions that are designed to be hard to crack.
Please, never ever encrypt passwords this way.

Sorry, encrypting passwords with a secret stored on the server
  isn't secure: If an intruder breaks into your codebase, intruder can retrieve
  each and any password using your codebase and the stored password 
  (somewhere in code or your persistent store).

OWASP, the Online Web Application Security Project, provides well prepared documents: Password Storage Cheat Sheet, Authentication Cheat Sheet and PHP Security Cheat Sheet. Have a look!
The way to go is a salted hash.
How to handle newly created passwords

If you create a new password, compute hash = HashFunction( password, salt ) with a random salt
Save hash and salt in your database along to the user's ID

How to verify password

Locate the userID's record in your database
retrieve hash and salt from the record
Based on the password, that user entered to log in, compute hash = HashFunction( enteredPassword, salt )
Finally, verify if the hash retrieved from store is identical to the one computed.

Why use a hash operation?
A hash operation is a so called trapdoor function: While you can compute the function easily, it's hard to compute the reverse function. 
Corollary: It's easy to compute a password-hash from a password, but it's hard to compute the password from the password-hash.
PHP's hash functions
These days, PHP's PBKDF2 is first choice for password hashes [Wikipedia on PBKDF2].
If your PHP installation is too old, even salted hashes with md5() are better than two-encrypted password. But only in case definitely nothing else is available!
Sample of PBKDF2 usage
function getHashAndSaltFromString( $password ) {

   // choose a sufficiently long number of iterations 
   // ... to make the operation COSTLY
   $iterations = 1000;

   // Generate a random IV using mcrypt_create_iv(),
   // openssl_random_pseudo_bytes() or another suitable source of randomness
   $salt = mcrypt_create_iv(16, MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM);

   $hash = hash_pbkdf2(""sha256"", $password, $salt, $iterations, 20);

   return array( $hash, $salt );

}

Beautiful side effect of hash usage
Many websites do restrict the length of passwords to a certain length - quite likely due to the length of the underlying persistent storage [= length of field in a database table].
If you use the hash-based password storage technique, your users might use passwords of arbitrary length! 

Since the hash is of constant length and you only persist password and
  salt, the length restriction is superfluous. Support long passwords in your web-app!

At an extreme case, you could even allow users to upload a file - e.g. a picture of their home - as a credential [=password].
Side note on random sources in PHP's MCRYPT functions
Note, that PHP does provide two sources of randomness MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM and MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM.

MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM gets its randomness from /dev/random
MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM gets its randomness from /dev/urandom

/dev/urandom provides random data immediately and non-blocking each time you query it, /dev/random might block (take some time to return).
Therefore, at first sight, /dev/urandom and MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM might be better suited for random number generation. In fact, it is not!
/dev/random might block request up to a point of time, at which sufficiently much entropy has been collected. Thus /dev/random and MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM effectively collects randomness. 

If you need to do strong crypto operations, use MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM or
  /dev/random.

","If you are using PHP >= 5.3.7, you should use the password_comp library which was written by guys involved in PHP and it utilizes BCRYPT which is the strongest algorithm available for PHP as of yet. 
It's very simple and easy to use.
https://github.com/ircmaxell/password_compat
Hash the password simply
 $hash = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);

Verify the given password against the stored password hash
if (password_verify($password, $hash)) {
    /* Valid */
} else {
    /* Invalid */
}

Pretty simple stuff, like they say no need to rewrite was has already been written especially when it comes to security and written by the experts.

","I wont comment on whether this is a good idea or not as I don't think you've given us enough information to do that. 
But the ""standard"" way of doing this is to hash the passphrase using MD5, SHA1, etc. You could add some secret salt to make it more secure as well
So Encryption becomes
salt = ""MY SECRET SALT TEXT""
plaintext = AES_KEY
key = sha1(passphrase + salt)
ciphertext = AES(key,plaintext)

Now ciphertext is the encrypted version of the AES key

","In your C# code you're using Rfc2898DeriveBytes to convert your password string into a 256-bit key (under the hood this is actually hashing the password using SHA-1), whereas in the C code you're using the key directly. You probably want to modify the C# code to use the key directly (it looks like a 256-bit key to me, not an ASCII password).
The following should be sufficient:
byte[] key = {0x4c, 0x69, 0x6e, 0x67, ...};

You'll also want to modify the C program to use the correct binary key, rather than taking one on the command line. You can use something like the following:
unsigned char key[KEYLENGTH(KEYBITS)] = {0x4c, 0x69, 0x6e, 0x67, ...};

I'm also not sure if you're using the same mode (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation). I think the C# code may be using CBC whereas the C code is using ECB. I suggest this as there's an iv in the C# code (generated from the password), but there isn't one in the C code.
You could also try to find a library that you can use from both C and C# and use that instead, for example openssl.

Btw, I'm using netbeans in JFrame and running GUI. Can anyone show full code for the key? by combine with my coding.

I just want to add the key for my encrypt image and only the person I
  give the key can only decrypt the image

In your code your secret key is byte[] k.
If you want to securely send that to the recipient along with the encrypted image you might want to consider using an asymmetric key encryption algorithm to encrypt your secret key.
In practice, you would use the recipient's public key to encrypt the key used in the AES algorithm. Only they can decrypt that key in order to decrypt the message.

"24962223","C# AES Encryption - Stream mode to automatically prepend IV","According to a comment on This Answer from GregS, the IV should be prepended to AES encrypted data (Assuming I'm reading it right):

Put it before the cipher. That way you can have decrypt in streaming mode.

It sounds to me like GregS is suggesting there's a streaming mode that will automatically prepend/parse the IV used in encryption.
Is this true?
I am currently manually prepending my IV to encrypted data and manually splitting ciphers into IV and data before decrypting. Is there a method to do this automatically?

For Reference:
Here's what I'm doing right now:
The Encrypt Method:
public byte[] Encrypt(byte[] data)
{
    // Generate IV
    var iv = new byte[BlockSize/8];
    new Random().NextBytes(iv);

    byte[] cipher = // encryption happens here

    // Prepend IV to Cipher
    var saltedCipher = new byte[iv.Length + cipher.Length];
    Buffer.BlockCopy(iv, 0, saltedCipher, 0, iv.Length);
    Buffer.BlockCopy(cipher, 0, saltedCipher, iv.Length, cipher.Length);

    return saltedCipher;
}

The Decrypt Method:
public byte[] Decrypt(byte[] saltedCipher)
{
    // Split saltedCipher into iv and cipher
    var iv = new byte[BlockSize/8];
    var cipher = new byte[saltedCipher.Length - iv.Length];
    Buffer.BlockCopy(buffer, 0, iv, 0, iv.Length);
    Buffer.BlockCopy(buffer, iv.Length, cipher, 0, cipher.Length);

    byte[] data = // decryption happens here

    return data;
}

","Using only the methods built in to the .NET framework, there is no way I know of that automatically prepends the data. There are many 3rd party libraries that will handle this for you, but the libraries in the System.Security.Cryptography do not by default.
Often when you are encrypting information you will have a header that contains all of the relevant information you need to know about the file before you decrypt it, what that information is varies wildly based on the needs of the software. For your simple example your header is just 

╔════════════════╦══════════════╦═══════════════════╦═════════════╗
║ Offset (bytes) ║ Size (bytes) ║ Encryption Status ║ Description ║
╠════════════════╬══════════════╬═══════════════════╬═════════════╣
║ 0              ║ BlockSize/8  ║  Unencrypted      ║ IV          ║
║ BlockSize/8    ║ Var.         ║  Encrypted        ║ Data Area   ║
╚════════════════╩══════════════╩═══════════════════╩═════════════╝

And that is all you need, because you are (I am assuming) a fixed block size you don't need any extra information like the IV length, or any metadata about the file. 
Compare that to a more complicated file, like a TrueCrypt container (The original site does not exist anymore with the spec, but I found this mirror)

* Provided that the options Quick Format and Dynamic are disabled and provided that the volume does not contain a filesystem that has been encrypted in place (note that TrueCrypt does not allow the user to create a hidden volume within such a volume).
† The encrypted areas of the volume header are encrypted in XTS mode using the primary and secondary header keys. For more information, see the section Encryption Scheme and the section Header Key Derivation, Salt, and Iteration Count.
‡ S denotes the size of the volume host (in bytes).
§ Note that the salt does not need to be encrypted, as it does not have to be kept secret [7] (salt is a sequence of random values).
** Multiple concatenated master keys are stored here when the volume is encrypted using a cascade of ciphers (secondary master keys are used for XTS mode).
†† See above in this section for information on the method used to fill free volume space with random data when the volume is created.
‡‡ Here, the meaning of ""system encryption"" does not include a hidden volume containing a hidden operating system.

So because the needs of a header can vary so much the .NET framework leaves it to the developer to design their own.

"6448226","Using Rjindael and RSA to encrypt data stored in QR code in Visual Basic .NET","I'm wanting to encrypt some data (hopefully under five hundred bytes' worth) and store it in a QR code. Originally I wanted to use RSA, so the data would be signed with User A's private key and User B's public key, but unfortunately, VB.NET doesn't like encrypting that much data. I've read that I should use Rjindael to encrypt the actual data, and then use RSA to encrypt the key used by Rjindael. However, I'm not having much luck being able to search the web for some kind of tutorial or something.
Also, if I was wanting to store this on a QR code, wouldn't I have to store both the encrypted data and the encrypted key used by Rjindael? Do you think this would all fit? I may be able to use version 40 on medium error correction (according to http://www.denso-wave.com/qrcode/vertable4-e.html, it stores 18,672 ""data bits""), but I would prefer to use a lower version (that is, smaller) if at all possible.
Generating the QR code won't be the problem (I know there's a .NET library for that), I'm just curious about getting the data encrypted to begin with.
Thanks for your help!

","Look at the ""binary"" column. This is actually how many bytes you can store.
Anything above version 10 gets a bit hard to scan in practice, though possible. Above version 20 it's quite difficult from a camera, though can be scanned off a printed page. So if the point is to scan with a camera -- no doesn't sound like it will fit in practice.

","This does indeed seem like a duplicate of Java Security: Illegal key size or default parameters? . You probably need to replace your local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar with the Unlimited Security versions. You can download them here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-6-download-429243.html
These files should be in your jre/lib/security/ folder. Also, for me I had a ton of different JREs in different locations, and the one I was using was inside my jdk folder path. It took me the longest time to figure this crap out

"35472403","Why PBKDF2 SHA256 generated hash value not equal between C and java","I have a Android client and Server, the client needs to validate the session key before communication or processing data with the server. The client was Android app and its encryption method was wrote in Java, the server`s was wrote in C.
I call the session key as ""magic token"", and the magic token is generated by PBKDF2 algorithm with 1000 iterations of SHA256 hash on server. The client fetch the magic token from server and the client itself needs to regenerate the magic token again in order to compare the fetched one and generated one. if they are equal, means the session key is valid and the client can go further operations. 
But my problem is when I trying to generate the magic token using the same algorithm, salt, iteration count with server side, the generated hash value are not the same. Maybe it caused by PBKDF2 algorithm or sha256 are not exactly same for different platforms. I feel really confused and anyone can help me find out where the error comes from?

","Updates after you provided iOS code:

The aesEncryptData should be your output.  Get rid of the hmac, that has nothing to do with AES encryption (instead, it is for message integrity).
The only way you are going to match your Android code is if you are using the same IV that the Android code is using.


Earlier reply: 
How long is the input?  Providing source code and sample data may help us solve the problem quicker.
Without the requested information, I don't have your answer, but I have a few pointers that might help you get to the bottom of it:

Your padding is okay.  PKCS5Padding in Java is wrongly named implementation of PKCS#7, so it should be compatible with Apple's kCCOptionPKCS7Padding.
Apple by default uses CBC mode under the hood if no mode is specified, so that agrees with the Android code.  So that cannot be the problem either.
When you encrypt, the ciphertext will be a multiple of 16 bytes (because AES has N=16 bytes block size and according to defn of PKCS #7).  Specifically:


If the input is a multiple of 16 bytes, then the output should be exactly 16 bytes more than the input.
If the input is not a multiple of 16 bytes, then the output should be 16*Ceiling(Input length/16).  Example: 47 byte input should be 16*Ceiling(17/16) = 16*3 = 48 byte output.

It is possible that one of the implementations is outputting the IV as part of the ciphertext.  If this is happening, it should be at the beginning of the ciphertext.  You should be able to test to see if this is happening.  (Let me know if that is happening please)

Having said that, something is weird and likely implemented wrong, and we need the code to get to the bottom of it.  It makes no sense that the Android code results in 3 blocks of 16 whereas the Apple code results in 5 blocks of 16.  
Also, as I commented above, even though Apple tells you that the IV is optional, they mean that it is optional in terms of getting the code to work.  It is not optional for security.  IVs are required and must be unpredictable for CBC mode of operation, and they should never be repeated.  If you ignore that, you leak information about your data, and in some situations, an attacker may be able to decrypt the data (padding oracle attacks).

  return View();
}

I prefer using managed crypto algorithms
I store contenttype of original file in blob metadata (so you know how to serve it)
catch {} gives me creeps, at least log the exception somewhere
Rather than playing with HttpContext.Response, create custom ActionResult
Always dispose IDisposable stuff

"45103983","Generate AES key based on password only","I have an application which may require a password for authentification.
This application does not handle any sensitive data, because this ""password"" is chosen by the host and told the ""clients"" via another channel (WhatsApp or whatever).
So when a client wants to authenticate, the host generates a random String which is sent to the client.
The client then encrypts this Random String with the password the user enters.
The encrypted random String is the sent back t the host.
The host decrypts this encrypted String with the key generated by the same password.
If the unencrypted and original String match, the user is logged in.
This is what I came up with so far:
String base64;
char[] password = ""password"".toCharArray();
String randomString = new BigInteger(130, new SecureRandom()).toString(32);
try {
    //Encrypt Client Side
    SecretKey key = new SecretKeySpec(SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512"").generateSecret(new PBEKeySpec(password)).getEncoded(), ""AES"");
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES"");
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
    base64 = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(cipher.doFinal(randomString.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)));
} catch (GeneralSecurityException e) {
    throw new IllegalStateException(e);
}
try {
    //Decrypt Server Side
    SecretKey key = new SecretKeySpec(SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512"").generateSecret(new PBEKeySpec(password)).getEncoded(), ""AES"");
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES"");
    cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key);
    //Check if both strings match
    System.out.println(Arrays.equals(cipher.doFinal(Base64.getDecoder().decode(base64)), randomString.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)));
} catch (GeneralSecurityException e) {
    throw new IllegalStateException(e);
}

Unfortunately this code throws an exception: java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException: Salt not found
Should I use a different algorithm, or should I generate a salt by hashing the password itself, or a completely different approach?
I'd like to avoid having to send a generated salt along with the random String
","You should give PBEKeySpec what it needs to generate enough bits for an AES key. You need the same salt on both sides, so you could do: 
 byte[] salt = new byte[8];
 System.arraycopy(randomString.getBytes(""UTF-8""), 0, salt, 0, 8);

Now replace your PBEKeySpec with new PBEKeySpec(password, salt, 10, 128) and everything should work.

But you can always try an approach of splitting the file and encrypt/decrypt each part separately where you can use some asynktasks to do it in ""parallel"".
For example you can have 7 files of 10MB each. You decrypt the 7 parts in paralel and stick them together after the decryption.
If you still want to have one physical file, you can put the encrypted separate parts in a zip file and extract them when you need to decrypt.

","If you are using policies in WS-SecurityPolicy (1.1 or later) in your wsdl, no need to generate policies nor make them on client side with Apache CXF. With WS-SecurityPolicy, CXF's security runtime is policy driven.
1) You follow CXF's WSDL-first approach to generate the client code, using either wsdl2java command-line tool or Maven cxf-codegen-plugin (wsdl2java goal). This is described in CXF doc's How to develop a client.
2) Following CXF's doc on WS-SecurityPolicy usage, you configure the client security properties for the  wsdl port you want to use, either using JAX-WS API (on the client's RequestContext) or Spring XML configuration. For the list of possible properties, there are the generic XML security ones and WS-Security-specific ones. Example with Spring XML for UsernameToken policy (from Glen Mazza's blog samples ):
<beans xmlns=""http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans""
   xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""
   xmlns:jaxws=""http://cxf.apache.org/jaxws""
   xsi:schemaLocation=""http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans 
   http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
   http://cxf.apache.org/jaxws 
   http://cxf.apache.org/schemas/jaxws.xsd"">
<jaxws:client name=""{http://www.example.org/contract/DoubleIt}DoubleItPort"" createdFromAPI=""true"">
        <!-- Use this for the UsernameToken Symmetric Binding w/X.509 for secret key derivation -->
        <jaxws:properties>
            <entry key=""ws-security.username"" value=""alice""/>        
            <entry key=""ws-security.callback-handler"" value=""client.ClientPasswordCallback""/>        
            <entry key=""ws-security.encryption.properties"" value=""clientKeystore.properties""/>
            <entry key=""ws-security.encryption.username"" value=""myservicekey""/>
        </jaxws:properties>

        <!-- Use this for the UsernameToken Symmetric Binding w/UT password for secret key derivation -->
        <!--jaxws:properties>
            <entry key=""ws-security.username"" value=""alice""/>        
            <entry key=""ws-security.callback-handler"" value=""client.ClientPasswordCallback""/>        
        </jaxws:properties-->
</jaxws:client>
</beans>

Put this in /cxf.xml on the class path. Warning: the example is using a CallbackHandler subclass (client.ClientPasswordCallback in this example) to provide the password. So you'll need to provide your own implementation. 
3) Back to CXF doc's How to develop a client - last part - in the application code, initialize the client using JAX-WS API with arguments: a) the location of the WSDL (URL) having the WS-SecurityPolicy policies (you already have that, as far as I understand); b) service and port's QNames to be used by the client, as defined in the WSDL:
final Service service = Service.create(wsdlLocation, SERVICE_QNAME);
final DoubleItPortType transportPort = service.getPort(PORT_QNAME, DoubleItPortType.class);

4) Make sure you have cxf-rt-ws-policy and cxf-rt-ws-security modules on the classpath at runtime to enable WS-SecurityPolicy support.

(A) -> (B) -> (C)
Station B receives the file from station A and pass it to station C.
I want to make sure that Station B will not be able to read the content of the file.
In order to enforce that I am using Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption to encrypt the file.

Generating a random symmetric key = SK on station A
Encrypt the file symmetrically using SK as the key.
Encrypting SK asymmetrically with C's public key = AK

Now I need to deliver C both AK and the Encrypted File.
Since B doesn't have the Private Key, he will not be able to retrieve SK and will not be able to decrypt the file.
Question:
1. Is there a way to combine AK and the encrypted File into one big file? (is there any standard way of doing this using OpenSSL). 
The only way i can think of is to make my own format: [AK Len][AK][Encrypted File]
Any libraries in python that can help doing that task?

I know that there is a possibility to add passwords to an existing symmetric key using

The question is whether adding a new encryption by password already does it and every password here would do open it, or the key is just additionally encrypted by the new password and one has to provide all passwords and/or other encryption data (certificates, other keys etc.) to open this key?
If the latter is true, how can I create several duplicates of the same symmetric key but with different passwords?
","
I use a symmetric key to encrypt my asymmetric key

I really hope this is a typo and you're doing it the other way. The correct hierarchy encryption is always symmetric key to encrypt the data and certificate/asymmetric key to encrypt the encryption key.
As for your question: adding a new encryption to a key does not drop previous encryptions. Multiple passwords can be added to a key. Though, judging from your example, you are planning to add the password to the symmetric key, which is likely incorrect.
The reason why the hierarchy matters is driven by two factors: 

symmetric key encryption is fast, asymmetric key encryption is extremely slow. Therefore direct data encryption is always done by the fast key, the symmetric one. 
data encryption keys needs to be periodically changed to reduce the collision probability and mitigate some many analytical attacks, as well as to reduce the surface exposed in case of key loss. This is done by simply changing the key and encrypting new data with the new key (re-encrypting old data is not only prohibitive, but would also negate the very benefit of key rotation). The new key is encrypted with the user certificate/asymmetric key/password thus opening it for use.

Please spend some time and read the relevant MSDN articles (start with the one linked above), this stuff is really easy to mess up and you'll end up with either 'perfect encryption' (ie. you loose the ability to decrypt the data) or worse, a lot of smoke and mirrors that would obfuscate the fact that your key management and hierarchy is plain broken.

This work well. But It seems that the standard is to to use EVP functions now with openssl. So I try to adapt my code but something is clearly wrong with my implementations. I don't understand on how properly update/increment the IV vector.

Everything classic as in another example.

      break;
    }
  }

  fclose(writeFile);
  fclose(readFile);
}

}

So I basically copy the AES_ctr_encrypt function to use EVP, and adapt it. 
It work for me, as I can use both implementation to encrypt/decrypt the same program. 
Comments are welcome.
Questions remain that what do the aes_ctr_128 in EVP ? and how to use it?
I think I have reinvented the wheel.

Any help appreciated. Thank you.
","In {EVP_aes_N_ctr()} the counter state is kept in {ctx->iv}, treated as an 128 big-endian integer, counting the crypto blocks, starting from the IV given to the Init function.  This counter tells the number of the next crypto block to be encrypted/decrypted.  This works with random access, i.e. ctx->iv can be computed manually before an *Update call, if on crypto block boundary.  As soon as at least one byte is returned from a cipher op, the counter is updated to hold the next crypto block to be processed.  If byte-level random access is wanted, there is also {ctx->num} that holds the byte offset into the current crypto block.  For this to work, the block must have been started on, i.e. a cipher op where {ctx->num} was equal to zero must have been issued, in order to correctly setup the internal state.
Below is a stupid, but still working example of how CTR mode can be used for random access decryption.

"38754954","max plaintext size for Android Keystore symmetric encryption?","I'd like to use the Android Keystore to do symmetric AES encryption of large (multi MB) data files.
I've written demo code that will encrypt/decrypt multi-KB files with the Keystore, but when the file size gets too large it starts to fall down.  This max size varies by device and can range anywhere from ~80KB to ~1MB.  On every Android-M device I've tested on (including the emulator) there seems to be a maximum size after which encryption will fail.
When it fails, it fails silently-- however the ciphertext size is typically quite a bit smaller than it should be (which of course can't then be decrypted).
Since it's so pervasive across multiple devices, either I'm doing something wrong (likely!), or there's some kind of undocumented limit to what can be encrypted in the Keystore.
I've written up a demo app on Github that shows the problem (here, specifically this file).  You can run the app gui to make the problem happen manually, or run the instrumentation tests to make it happen.
Any help or pointers to documentation about this problem would be greatly appreciated!
For reference, I'm generating the symmetric key like this:
KeyGenerator keyGenerator  = KeyGenerator.getInstance(KeyProperties.KEY_ALGORITHM_AES, ""AndroidKeyStore"");
keyGenerator.init(
        new KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder(KEY_ALIAS, KeyProperties.PURPOSE_ENCRYPT|KeyProperties.PURPOSE_DECRYPT)
                .setBlockModes(KeyProperties.BLOCK_MODE_GCM)
                .setEncryptionPaddings(KeyProperties.ENCRYPTION_PADDING_NONE)
                .build()
);
SecretKey key = keyGenerator.generateKey();

SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(key.getAlgorithm(), ""AndroidKeyStore"");
KeyInfo keyInfo= (KeyInfo)factory.getKeySpec(key, KeyInfo.class);
logger.debug(""isInsideSecureHardware: {}"", keyInfo.isInsideSecureHardware());

and I'm encrypting like this:
KeyStore keyStore= KeyStore.getInstance(""AndroidKeyStore"");
keyStore.load(null);
KeyStore.SecretKeyEntry keyEntry= (KeyStore.SecretKeyEntry)keyStore.getEntry(KEY_ALIAS, null);

Cipher cipher= getCipher();
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, keyEntry.getSecretKey());
GCMParameterSpec params= cipher.getParameters().getParameterSpec(GCMParameterSpec.class);

ByteArrayOutputStream byteStream= new ByteArrayOutputStream();
DataOutputStream dataStream= new DataOutputStream(byteStream);

dataStream.writeInt(params.getTLen());
byte[] iv= params.getIV();
dataStream.writeInt(iv.length);
dataStream.write(iv);

dataStream.write(cipher.doFinal(plaintext));

Update:
Per the suggestions of user2481360 and Artjom B. I changed to chunking the plaintext as it goes into the cypher like this:
ByteArrayInputStream plaintextStream= new ByteArrayInputStream(plaintext);
final int chunkSize= 4*1024;
byte[] buffer= new byte[chunkSize];
while (plaintextStream.available() > chunkSize) {
    int readBytes= plaintextStream.read(buffer);
    byte[] ciphertextChunk= cipher.update(buffer, 0, readBytes);
    dataStream.write(ciphertextChunk);
}
int readBytes= plaintextStream.read(buffer);
byte[] ciphertextChunk= cipher.doFinal(buffer, 0, readBytes);
dataStream.write(ciphertextChunk);

This appears to solve the problem with the ciphertext being completely wrong.  I can now use very large plaintext sizes.
However, depending on the size sometimes the data doesn't roundtrip.  For example, if I use 1MB the roundtripped plaintext is missing a few bytes at the end.  But if I use 1MB+1B, it will work.  My understanding of AES/GCM was that the input plaintext doesn't have to have a special size (aligned to the block length, etc).

Read the file normally
open(my $fh, ""<"", ""myTestFile.ext"");
Read the file in binmode 
open(my $fh, ""<"", ""myTestFile.ext"");
binmode $fh

Then how should I store the content of the files?
a) Read all the content of the file in one string and provide the string to the implemented program
my $document = do {
    local $/ = undef;
    <$fh>; # file handle opened previously
};
encryptionAlgorithm($document);

b) Read the content of the file line by line
while( my $line = <$fh>)
{
    encryptionAlgorithm($line);
}

In both cases should I chomp the \n's ?
","AES encrypts blocks of 128 bits (16 bytes), so you'll want to read your file 16 bytes at a time. To do this, you need to binmode your file, then read it with the read builtin:
open my $fh, '<', 'myTestFile.ext' or die $!;
binmode $fh;

while (read($fh,my $block,16)) {
    # encrypt $block
}

Note that I've added or die $! after opening the file: you want to always make sure your open worked.
Also, don't forget that if the block you read is less than 16 bytes long, you'll have to do some padding. (I don't recall how the blocks are padded for AES, but I trust you do since you are implementing it)

About the approaches you thought of:

Reading the entire file at once will potentially consume a lot of memory if the file is big.
Reading the file line by line: if the file contains no newline, then you'll read it entirely at once, which might consume a lot of memory. And if lines contain a number of bytes which isn't a multiple of 16, then you'll have to combine bytes from different lines, which will require more work than simply reading blocks of 16 bytes.  

Also, you definitely don't want to chomp anything! You should have decrypt(encrypt(file)) == file, but if you chomp the newlines, that won't be the case anymore.

","You shouldn't be constructing std::string out of a char*, if the char* is pointing to something that isn't a text string, such as encrypted data.
std::string ciphertext = out;

The construction of ciphertext is going to stop copying from out as soon as it reaches a 0 byte. Instead, you need to also pass in the length of the encrypted data and use the std::string(const char* data, size_t size) constructor.
std::string ciphertext(out, outSize);

Alternatively, you can also use the constructor taking a begin and end iterator.

","Are you using SQL Server 2005 or above? If so you could just use VARCHAR(MAX) or NVARCHAR(MAX) for the column type.
If you want to be a bit more precise...
The maximum block size for RijndaelManaged is 256 bits (32 bytes).
Your maximum input size is 20 characters, so even if we assume a worst-case scenario of 4 bytes per character, that'll only amount to 80 bytes, which will then be padded up to a maximum of 96 bytes for the encryption process.
If you use Base64 encoding on the encrypted output that will create 128 characters from the 96 encrypted bytes. If you use hex encoding then that will create 192 characters from the 96 encrypted bytes (plus maybe a couple of extra characters if you're prefixing the hex string with ""0x""). In either case a column width of 200 characters should give you more than enough headroom.
(NB: These are just off-the-top-of-my-head calculations. I haven't verified that they're actually correct!)

","Hybrid Cryptosystems
The ""normal"" way of encryption in OpenPGP (which GnuPG implements) is hybrid encryption: public/private key cryptography for key management and encrypting a session key, and subsequently symmetric encryption using this session key of the actual data.
From what you write, it seems the public/private key cryptography step was omitted, and the session key instead generated using a passphrase, for example by using the command gpg --symmetric. You can determine how it was encrypted using pgpdump. Output for a symmetrically encrypted file looks like
Old: Symmetric-Key Encrypted Session Key Packet(tag 3)(13 bytes)
    New version(4)
    Sym alg - CAST5(sym 3)
    Iterated and salted string-to-key(s2k 3):
        Hash alg - SHA512(hash 10)
        Salt - 3b be 1b 03 64 c3 bb 7e 
        Count - 102400(coded count 105)
New: Symmetrically Encrypted Data Packet(tag 9)(26 bytes)
    Encrypted data [sym alg is specified in sym-key encrypted session key]

Especially consider the first line with the symmetric-key encrypted session key packet.
What to do
I'm sorry I do not really know C#, and neither have worked with Bouncy Castle yet, so I cannot provide a ready-to-run solution. Moreover, the C# documentation seems to be more or less inexistent.
I'd guess you'll have to make use of the PgpPbeEncryptedData class, which seems to take an input stream and a passphrase and provides the decrypted information as an output stream. There is an example for the Java Bouncy Castle package, which will probably be very similar and mostly boils down to
byte[] decryptedAgainByteArray = ByteArrayHandler.decrypt(encryptedAgain, PASS.toCharArray());

"41766970","Setting AES cipher mode for ASP.NET MachineKey from web.config","I try using ASP.NET FormAuthentication for my website authentication. I added machineKey element in my web.config so that I can choose what validation and decryption algorithms to use for my authentication. Looking at the machineKey documentation, I found out that I can choose between these algorithms for the validation:

[SHA1 | MD5 | 3DES | AES | HMACSHA256 | HMACSHA384 | HMACSHA512 | alg:algorithm_name]

And I can choose between these algorithms for the decryption:

[Auto | DES | 3DES | AES | alg:algorithm_name]

I notice that when I try to use the AES algorithm (by setting both validation and decryption attribute in machineKey element to ""AES""), I can't change its cipher mode (I assume it use CBC as the default as the documentation says). I want to use AES algorithm with different cipher mode here. So just setting the attributes' value to ""AES"" doesn't solve my problem. The machineKey documentation says this for the alg:algorithm_name:

alg:algorithm_name  Specifies that ASP.NET uses a custom algorithm to encrypt and decrypt data. The encryption algorithm must be defined in a class that derives from SymmetricAlgorithm. ASP.NET calls the SymmetricAlgorithm.Create method and passes in the name of the algorithm that is specified here.

Reading this I assume that it is possible to reference a custom algorithm made with SymmetricAlgorithm.Create method here. And since SymmetricAlgorithm class has a ""mode"" property which can be used for getting and setting the cipher mode, I guess this can solve my problem.
Now my problem is I don't know how to reference my custom algorithm (which is AES but using other cipher mode, e.g. ECB mode) into the machineKey element in the web.config. I am trying to find other documentation, with no luck. Is there any way to set the validation and decryption attribute of the machineKey element in web.config so that it use my custom algorithm? Or is there any other way so that I can use my custom algorithm for the FormAuthentication's validation and decryption?

Note: I know there is some efficiency problems in this program like why do i keep computing the key ever block i get from the file.. I am fixing that later.. It was just there to test some things out.
Anyways, I am using the encrypt(File) method and when i give it a file it gets the information 1024 bytes at a time and encrypts that information then coverts to BASE64 to avoid encoding issues.. then writes it back to a different file with the same name but the words ENCRYPTED or DECRYPTED in front of it... and in the same directory as the parent file..
Now my problem is when it is encrypting the information I am sending it 1024 bytes of information to process and then using BASE64 to avoid encoding issues such as UTF and such.. but in the end of things the 1024 bytes that i am encrypting some how turns into 1388 bytes of data and that is what i get back... Now why is that? 
Second problem: It somewhat works besides the problem above maybe its not a problem but I would love to learn why.. Anyways the second problem is also using the encrypt(File) method As well as decrypt(File).. When i encrypt the file it somehow adds some extra length to it (Might be directly related to the problem above...), So that when i decrypt the file the file has the text perfectly decrypted but then I get some extra repeat text at the bottom for whatever reason... Like the file will be in order until the end with some repeat information.. So i don't know where these random bytes are coming from but i would love to know..
Anyways, If you find any other problems with my encryption methods please please tell me here, Possibly weak encryption choice? Maybe it is easily being able to be brute-forced? Using an inefficient method? Don't understand something I am trying to accomplish? Possibly like saving the file with the same name and the same directory.. Is there an easier way?
","Base-64 encoding a string results in a longer string than you started with.
Think of it this way. You had an array with 8 significant bits in each byte. You end up with a string with only 6 of the bits being important (hence the 64 in the name, base-64, because 2^6 = 64) so it has to be longer by roughly 1/3.
Working backwards, AES encryption using the modes you have will add 16 bytes of padding so the result will be 16 bytes longer than what you fed it. That means you give it 1024 and encryption (before the base-64 encoding) will result in a length of 1040 bytes.
The arithmetic works this way:
1024 bytes + 16 padding = 1040 bytes
1040 bytes is not divisible by 3 (as required by base-64) so add 1 byte
1041 bytes * 8 = 8328 bits / 6 = 1388
1388 base-64 characters

PART 2
The reason you have extra bytes on the end is in this code:
byte[] buff = new byte[1024];
while((read = bIs.read(buff)) != -1)
{
    byte[] enc = encrypt(buff);
    bOs.write(enc, 0, enc.length);
}

On the last read, it does not read a full 1024 bytes into the buffer. The bytes from the previous read are still there.
The variable 'read' holds the number of bytes actually read. Notice how that variable isn't used. But you are encrypting the entire buffer, not just the first 'read' number of bytes.
You can fix this by passing the value of 'read' into your 'encrypt' method and using the alternate form of the doFinal(buff, 0, read) method to just encrypt what was read.
Change this line:
    byte[] enc = encrypt(buff, read);

And this one:
public byte[] encrypt(byte[] plainText, int len) throws Exception

And this one:
byte[] enc = Base64.encodeBase64(cipher.doFinal(plainText, 0, len));

You will need to do something similar to your decrypt because it may not have 1388 bytes to read the last time and the old bytes will be in the buffer. (You don't have this problem now because you always encrypt 1024 bytes. It's just that some of them are wrong if the file has a short read on the last block.)

","I found the issue in my program. I was not defining the cipher variable as static. Now that I define it static, the correct cipher data is written to the file.
Why static worked?
I called a ciphering function to calculate the cipher and then return the cipher. Since the cipher was not declared as static, it lost its value after exiting the function, thus the data returned was not the same as the data in the cipher. After declaring cipher as static, the value of cipher retained after function call and wrote correct information in the file.

SET @secretKey1 = ""some key"";
SET @secretKey2 = CONCAT(""some other key"", AccountNo);
SET @encryptedAccountNo = TO_BASE64(AES_ENCRYPT(AccountNo, @secretKey1));
SET @encryptedId = TO_BASE64(AES_ENCRYPT(Id, @secretKey));

Would using UUID as the primary key be more appropriate? If so, is using the UUID enough or should that be encrypted too?
Or would you use some other design entirely? 
Also, do you have any tips for improving the security or performance aspects of the existing design?
","I think you may have misunderstood that advice....
When you say ""I was advised against using auto increment and returning the id directly"".
You should certainly always CHECK the Id is correct to use server side, before using it;
(i.e. check that the document with that Id belongs to the user who is trying to edit it), 
but encrypting the ID itself really serves no useful purpose as your API will have to deal with the encrypted one (unless you are encrypt/decrypt client side, which does nothing for security), so the (malicious) client can just send the encrypted version and have the exact same result...
We cannot comment of the security of your code from looking at a (small) piece of your database logic. If you want proper review you will have to post the code that actually does the interaction...

","The entire concept of a private key is defeated if it has to be transmitted from one device to another. Each end of the communication channel must generate their own private keys. Note, that this doesn't mean compiling private keys into an executable, because then everyone with the executable shares a private key, which is obviously not what you want. Each individual device has to use a cryptographically secure source of random numbers to generate it's own public/private key pair. Then public keys can be exchanged in the clear, you can use them to exchange session keys (which can be unique for each and every file), private keys can sign, and everybody is happy.

","Just a couple suggestions:
-You should consider symmetric keys embedded into anything outside your server as public due to reverse engineering (i.e. don't bother even encrypting if the key is out in the wild).
-You should use a per-session symmetric key generated by a secure RNG on the client, and transmitted to the server encrypted with the global asymmetric public key.  Private keys have a shelf-life.
-You can use the session key for all files/streams transferred in that session, but you should use a unique nonce to salt the symmetric-key encryption for each file.  Depending on the encryption mode, using the same key/nonce with more than one stream can leave you vulnerable to XOR'ing the two streams and recovering a mashed-together but unencrypted result.

        using (TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider prov3des = new TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider())

           prov3des.IV = new byte[] { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 }; //8 bytes, zero-ed

And, like the poster linked above, the hash of the password is the same, and the first 8 bytes of the encrypted byte array are the same.  I've got the initialization vector set to 8 bytes of zero, but I figure if the first 8 bytes of the encrypted data are the same, then the initialization vector must match.  I just can't figure out why the next 8 bytes differ.  Any ideas what I'm doing wrong here?
Thanks!
","If the first 8 bytes are the same and the rest are not, it sounds like you are using a different form of feedback than the original algorithm.  Try using different values of CipherMode and see if one of them gives you a match.

","There's actually a very simple solution, although it's not at all obvious.  You have a block of code which says ""If this data isn't exactly a multiple of 8, pad it.""  However, this is changing the value you're encrypting, so you get a different result.
Simply remove the whole if(streamToEncrypt.Length.Dump(""Length"") % 8 != 0) {} block and you'll get the expected result.

AES is based on a design principle known as a substitution-permutation network, and is fast in both software and hardware.[6] Unlike its predecessor DES, AES does not use a Feistel network. AES is a variant of Rijndael which has a fixed block size of 128 bits, and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits. By contrast, the Rijndael specification per se is specified with block and key sizes that may be any multiple of 32 bits, both with a minimum of 128 and a maximum of 256 bits.

I am using the AESCryptoServiceProvider class for testing some encryption concepts. So far in all the examples and articles out there they generate a random key to use for encryption and then immediately for decryption. Sure, it works fine because you are using the key right there, but if you encrypt, save the text and at a later time you want to decrypt it you will need the SAME key. And for that purpose also the same IV.
Now, in this code I am using the same key and IV on multiple passes, every time I run the batch that batch gives the same result (as expected). But then I close the test application and rerun the same code without change and the resulting (Base64-encoded) cypher text is different for the same input parameters, why?
I ""saved"" one of the B64-encoded cyphers from a previous run and fed it to the TestDecrypt method and as expected, it threw a cryptographic exception mentioning something about padding though I am sure it has to do with the fact that somehow for the same Key,IV, plain text and parameters it gives a different result on every separate run of the application.
For encrypting I have this:
    public string Test(string password, Guid guid, string text)
    {
        const int SaltSize = 16;

        string b64Cryptogram;
        MD5CryptoServiceProvider md5 = new MD5CryptoServiceProvider();
        Rfc2898DeriveBytes pwbytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, SaltSize);

        // Block 128-bits Key 128/192/256 bits (16/24/32 bytes)
        using (AesCryptoServiceProvider aes = new AesCryptoServiceProvider())
        {
            aes.Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7;
            aes.Mode = CipherMode.CBC;
            //aes.IV = pwbytes.GetBytes(aes.BlockSize / 8);
            aes.IV = md5.ComputeHash(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(password));
            aes.Key = guid.ToByteArray();

            ICryptoTransform encryptor = aes.CreateEncryptor(aes.Key, aes.IV);
            using (MemoryStream msEncrypt = new MemoryStream())
            {
                using (CryptoStream csEncrypt = new CryptoStream(msEncrypt, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write))
                {
                    using (StreamWriter swEncrypt = new StreamWriter(csEncrypt))
                    {

                        //Write all data to the stream.
                        swEncrypt.Write(text);
                    }
                    b64Cryptogram = Convert.ToBase64String(msEncrypt.ToArray());
                }
            }
            Console.WriteLine(""E: {0}"", b64Cryptogram);
            aes.Clear();
        }
        return b64Cryptogram;
    }

Notice I am not using the RFC2898DeriveBytes because it will randomly derive something I will no longer remember :) The idea of encrypting it is precisely that I KNOW what I used to encrypt it.
The decryption method looks like this:
    public void TestDecrypt(string password, Guid guid, string ciphertextB64)
    {
        const int SaltSize = 16;

        byte[] cipher = Convert.FromBase64String(ciphertextB64);
        string plaintext;

        MD5CryptoServiceProvider md5 = new MD5CryptoServiceProvider();
        Rfc2898DeriveBytes pwbytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, SaltSize);

        // Block 128-bits Key 128/192/256 bits (16/24/32 bytes)
        using (AesCryptoServiceProvider aes = new AesCryptoServiceProvider())
        {
            aes.Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7;
            aes.Mode = CipherMode.CBC;

            aes.IV = md5.ComputeHash(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(password));
            aes.Key = guid.ToByteArray();

            ICryptoTransform decryptor = aes.CreateDecryptor(aes.Key, aes.IV);
            using (MemoryStream msEncrypt = new MemoryStream(cipher))
            {
                using (CryptoStream csEncrypt = new CryptoStream(msEncrypt, decryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Read))
                {
                    using (StreamReader swEncrypt = new StreamReader(csEncrypt))
                    {
                        plaintext = swEncrypt.ReadToEnd();
                    }

            Console.WriteLine(""D: {0}"", plaintext);
            aes.Clear();
        }
    }

Now, just put that in a console application and run it. Then exit and run it again and you will see that for the same Mode, Padding, IV, Key and plain text data, the output cipher will not be the same on every application run. They will be the same provided you run the method repeatedly in the same run of the application.
In case it was not obvious, here is the console code I used to test:
        Guid guid = Guid.NewGuid();
        string plain = ""Text to be encrypted 123458970"";
        string password = ""This is a test of the emergency broadcast system"";

        TestDecrypt(password, guid, Test(password, guid, plain));
        TestDecrypt(password, guid, Test(password, guid, plain));
        Test(password, guid, plain);
        Test(password, guid, plain);
        Test(plain, guid, password);
        TestDecrypt(password, guid, ""W4Oi0DrKnRpxFwtE0xVbYJwWgcA05/Alk6LrJ5XIPl8="");
    }    

","The solution here is to pull in from a stored or constant Guid. Calling 
Guid.NewGuid();

will return a different result every time. From the docs:


This is a convenient static method that you can call to get a new Guid. The method wraps a call to the Windows CoCreateGuid function. The returned Guid is guaranteed to not equal Guid.Empty.


Alternatively when testing you can use Guid.Empty which will return all zeroes.
Or, you can store it as such using its string constructor overload:
var guid = new Guid(""0f8fad5b-d9cb-469f-a165-70867728950e"");

It seems like the first half of the text is NOT decrypted while the second half is decrypted just fine. What should I do?
The PHP encryption method is as follows:
function decrypt($str, $iv) {
    $iv .= ""00000000"";
    $str = base64_decode($str);
    return self::decrypt_data($str, $iv, self::secret_key);

The iPhone stuff that encrypts the text uses a CryptoHelper class like this:
NSString *encrypted = [[CryptoHelper sharedInstance] encryptString:dataString];

The CryptoHelper class can be seen at http://pastie.org/1267796.
","Try a simple example where you send a known Base64 encoded string from the iPhone app to PHP.
Compare the known valid string to what PHP is getting. I know recently, when trying to do an Ajax post from a script to PHP, we were having trouble with some characters (specifically +) being converted to spaces by PHP because it was doing a URL decode automatically. We had to switch all + to their % (URL-encoded %2B) equivalent. This fixed the problem for us.

You should consider alternatives to storing plain-text passwords in the database.  See:

http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/09/youre-probably-storing-passwords-incorrectly.html

Instead of encoding the password in Javascript, then decoding the password in Tcl to compare with the database, you should consider SHA1 hashing in Javascript, and storing SHA1 hashed values in the database.
There are several available examples of a SHA1 hash function in javascript (just Google 'sha1 javascript').  The tcllib Tcl library has SHA1 support. 
As HaiVu mentioned, you should also consider hashing / storing more than just a straight password hash, but instead use something like SHA1( username + websitename + password ).  You can calculate this on the client in Javascript, and store it in the db.

","The symmetric cryptography provider keys are stored in a file that is referenced using a full physical file path and name in the application configuration file and protected by DPAPI encryption, just like shown in your config. Because DPAPI is not available in Windows Azure, using the Enterprise Library symmetric cryptography providers out of the box won't work. 
However, you can consider creating a custom symmetric algorithm provider for use with the Enterprise Library Crypto block. This provider could use the .NET Cryptographic Service Providers to implement encryption and as a best practice store the keys in encrypted format, performing the encryption offline, and storing them in Windows Azure Blob storage.

CryptoFileLoader.loadPassword(CryptoFileLoader.java:151)

I gave a look at the source code of CryptoFileLoader.java
It seems to me that things are a bit different from what you do: the password is stored in an encrypted file using the PBKDF2 algorithm, which is not equivalent to apply AES-128-ECB. From wikipedia:

PBKDF2 applies a pseudorandom function, such as hash-based message authentication code (HMAC), to the input password or passphrase along with a salt value and repeats the process many times to produce a derived key, which can then be used as a cryptographic key in subsequent operations. The added computational work makes password cracking much more difficult, and is known as key stretching.

There is no way to do PBKDF2 from Openssl command line. I made a small test using Java, it could be an alternative

","As in Simone's answer - there is a difference in the encryption algorithm between openssl and java implementation.  That is why you can decrypt using openssl with no problem (as it is invoking its own (different) algorithm again).
After much digging I found this answer from (Dave Thompson) which states:

Short answer: what openssl enc (without -K for raw) uses is not PBKDF2; it is almost PBKDF1, with iteration count 1.

It seems that there are two ways round this issue, either: 
a) Find something in java that can decrypt what openssl is doing - there is a java library 'BouncyCastle' referenced in a post inside this answer (if you are happy using that instead of standard CryptoFile) where they have implemented the exact same algorithm that openssl is using.
or
b) Find some other command line utility to use instead of openssl that implements PBKDF2.  A number of implementations in different languages are referenced in the nabble.com posting also mentioned.

    String result = """";
    for(int index = 0; index < raw.length; index++) {
        result += Integer.toHexString(raw[index]);
        // maybe you have to convert your byte to int before this can be done
        // (cannot check reight now)
    }

    Log.d(""HIDEMYPICS"",""Passphrase: "" + new String(seed).toString() + "" Key: "" + result );
    return raw;
}

The output for the ""test"" input string is as follows for the above hex-dump of the key:

Thanks in advance for any help with this issue!
","You state: ""2 different keys"", the keys must be the same.
Typically you pre-share a key or password and if you use a password derive a key from it with a function such as PBKDF2. If you use password derivation you must use the same deterministic function on both encryption and decryption. The function used must produce the same key from the password on each side. Since you are using a random generator the derivation is not deterministic and this can not work.

","You are using the random as input as a passphrase. Only the first line is used. So you are not generating the key at all, the key is generated using the S2K algorithms, using just the first line.

","You are assuming that the entire buffer is plaintext data as well. You should only return that part of the buffer that contains the plaintext data (using the response of Read to see how much bytes are returned).  The encrypted data is usually larger because of the padding.
As a single read method isn't good practice with regards to stream handling. You need to read until the end of the stream is reached. Otherwise you may go from having too much data to having too little.

","Symmetric encryption is a general facility so that you can encrypt a message in clear (cleartext) to its encrypted equivalent (ciphertext) and decrypt back using a key, called the private key. Whoever has the key will be able to do this operation back and forth (hence the word symmetric).This, as you know, is very different from encoding/decoding where there is no private key involved, knowing the encoding algorithm is enough to decode (e.g. Base 64).
You seem to have an additional requirement that the ciphertext should be shorter than cleartext. Some compression techniques can be utilized, but this is tricky and perhaps uncalled for in your use case. In general, if you use SymmetricEncryption utility like this (real code, try with Java 8) you will see that the ciphertext is longer than ciphertext (not what you want).
Lastly, this solution may be complicated for your use case. If I understand correctly, you want to identify an HTTP session with some information. If you store that information in the cookie, yes, you will need to secure that information so that your solution is at least as secure as the cookie itself. But in such cases, you use the server side storage for session, rather than the cookie store. See how this is done using Rails for instance. Something similar should be available in Java. This way, what you store in the cookie is a 'reference' to the confidential data and the confidential data is stored on the server side (which is, supposedly, at least as secure as the entire server is).

I have investigated the way to do the same on Ruby and I found this answer (How to decode Rijndael in ruby (encoded in VB.net)) but it doesn't works for me. Also, I'm not sure of what value i have to use for the iv. The web service brings me a Token that i have to use as the key (100% sure about that), but, actually don't know what i'm missing up.
The code I'm using for encrypt is:
# /lib/crypt.rb
module Crypt
  ...
  def Crypt.encrypt(data, key, iv, cipher_type)
    aes = OpenSSL::Cipher::Cipher.new(cipher_type)
    aes.encrypt
    aes.key = key
    aes.iv = iv
    aes.update(data) + aes.final
  end
end

# ../ws.rb
...
token = ""8c5d0e6b93cf5d38d7a076b2db35ee6d"" #this is a one of the tokens i received
iv = token
Crypt.encrypt(a_serialized_json,token,iv,""AES-128-CBC"")

The encrypted serialized json data that I have to send must be like a hexdigest string like this ""f0997ddbb17b08913e00b6fb2541312c1cfdda85e555451a1832df076a5d4a5f7d81d8db92715eade144e9696dfbe9eea573baa8ea90cdbe5baadf32fdeb6db8c9ab6743f8eeeb508921999d7513fad3"". But the method described on the link generates a encrypted string like this """"^w\x9A\x90B\xDC\f\x16\xB8\xBDt\xFBo\xD7r\x97"""".
Any idea of what I'm doing wrong or what I'm missing?
UPDATE: I figured out that the string output I'm getting is a byte array, and i have to convert this byte array to an hex string. I'm using the following aproach (https://github.com/atomicobject/hex_string/blob/master/lib/hex_string.rb). But, still not sure if Cypher is properly configured to acts as the C# code.
","Finally, I found a library that exactly match the C# code and is ruby-mcrypt (https://github.com/kingpong/ruby-mcrypt). And the encryption/decryption code i used is this:
require 'mcrypt'

module Crypt
  def Crypt.m_encrypt(data, key)
    crypto = Mcrypt.new(:rijndael_128, :ecb, key, nil, :zeros)
    encrypted_data = crypto.encrypt(data)
    encrypted_data
  end

  def Crypt.m_decrypt(data, key)
    crypto = Mcrypt.new(:rijndael_128, :ecb, key, nil, :zeros)
    crypto.decrypt(data)
  end
end

IMPORTANT: This C# Rjandael library doesn't uses the IV, for that reason i'm giving nil parameter as IV to Mcrypt.
This is only the encryption/decryption section, i'm also converting string to hexa format. Hope it can help somebody else!

AIX RISC

These can decrypt their own data, but NOT each other, nor any of the above:

Solaris i386

I first thought this was an endian issue, butAIX/RISC and Linux/PPC are BE, and they seem to play well wit the Linux i386 and x86_64 (LE).

#[openssl-1.0.1g] ./Configure solaris-x86-cc shared

NOTE that the Solaris systems both use ""/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc"" as the compiler, and all others use ""gcc"".
I have verified that I am always starting with the same IV/counter and symkey when encrypting and decrypting. The encryption routines are well embededed in my programs, but this is basically all that I'm doing:
uchar ivec[AES_BLOCK_SIZE], ecount[AES_BLOCK_SIZE], symkey[16];
uint num = 0, bits = 128;
uchar *buf, *ebuf; /* these are malloc'd and buf set to data to encrypt/decrypt */

memset(ivec, 0, AES_BLOCK_SIZE);

AES_set_encrypt_key(symkey, bits, &outkey);
...
AES_ctr128_encrypt(inp, outp, bytes, key, ivec, ecount, &num);

Again, this always works when encrypting/decrypting on the same system, only decodes to junk when one of the systems is Solaris. I'm using very old Solaris OS and boxes, however, since I have to maintain backward compatibility.

"23306917","AES_ctr128_encrypt on Solaris doesnt decrypt same as other OS's","I've compiled the libcrypto.so shared library from openssl-1.0.1g for various platforms. Using the shared library, my app is able to encrypt/decrypt data between any of the following:

Linux i386
Linux x86_64
Linux PPC
AIX RISC

These can decrypt their own data, but NOT each other, nor any of the above:

Solaris i386
Solaris SPARC

I first thought this was an endian issue, butAIX/RISC and Linux/PPC are BE, and they seem to play well wit the Linux i386 and x86_64 (LE).
The Solaris systems are:
SunOS pluto 5.9 Generic_Virtual sun4u sparc SUNW,SPARC-Enterprise-T5120
SunOS nemo 5.9 Generic_118559-11 i86pc i386 i86pc

The libcrypto.so was compiled with:
#[openssl-1.0.1g] ./Configure solaris-sparcv9-cc shared 
#[openssl-1.0.1g] ./Configure solaris-x86-cc shared

NOTE that the Solaris systems both use ""/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc"" as the compiler, and all others use ""gcc"".
I have verified that I am always starting with the same IV/counter and symkey when encrypting and decrypting. The encryption routines are well embededed in my programs, but this is basically all that I'm doing:
uchar ivec[AES_BLOCK_SIZE], ecount[AES_BLOCK_SIZE], symkey[16];
uint num = 0, bits = 128;
uchar *buf, *ebuf; /* these are malloc'd and buf set to data to encrypt/decrypt */
...
memcpy(symkey, MYTESTKEY, 16);
memset(ecount, 0, AES_BLOCK_SIZE);
memset(ivec, 0, AES_BLOCK_SIZE);
memcpy(ivec, SOMEDATA, 8); /* from RAND_seed() and RAND_bytes() */
AES_set_encrypt_key(symkey, bits, &outkey);
...
AES_ctr128_encrypt(inp, outp, bytes, key, ivec, ecount, &num);

Again, this always works when encrypting/decrypting on the same system, only decodes to junk when one of the systems is Solaris. I'm using very old Solaris OS and boxes, however, since I have to maintain backward compatibility.
Thanks in advance! 
","Just to update, I converted to EVP but no difference. I recompiled libcrypto.so with GCC also with no difference (using solaris64-sparcv9-gcc) - until I removed the link to cc from /usr/bin. Then I recompiled using GCC again and this time it worked. I didn't have time to investigate further, but it implies that some of the objects were still being compiled with cc, even after specifying *-gcc. Unfortunately there's no GCC available for our old Solaris-x86 V9 system, so we won't be supporting V9 on intel anymore.

","This code has a number of flaws:

If input or password are not ASCII a silent degradation occurs. In particular non ascii input won't be decrypted correctly.
You don't use many iterations, this means that brute-forcing if really fast.
The lack of salt is harder to expoit here than with password hashes since the hash is not directly known. But if you encrypt files with a known beginning block(which is common with many file headers) then one could build a rainbow table for this one format. But as always rainbow tables don't gain you anything if you just try to crack a single file/hash. They only gain if you need to crack many different passwords used in the same way.
The ECB mode isn't recommended, since it encrypts each block separately. This makes the problem of 3) much worse, since you just need to know the plaintext of any block to build a table. In particular the last block usually has low entropy. I'd expect every 16th set of data to have only 8 bits of entropy in it. Ouch.
I'm not sure how PaddingMode.Zeros works. But it might not be possible to strip the padding since its length isn't encoded. So you might have some additional 0 bytes after decrypting.


The Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode encrypts each block individually. Any blocks of plain text that are identical and in the same message, or that are in a different message encrypted with the same key, will be transformed into identical cipher text blocks. Important:  This mode is not recommended because it opens the door for multiple security exploits. If the plain text to be encrypted contains substantial repetition, it is feasible for the cipher text to be broken one block at a time. It is also possible to use block analysis to determine the encryption key. Also, an active adversary can substitute and exchange individual blocks without detection, which allows blocks to be saved and inserted into the stream at other points without detection.

"5337439",".NET: Best practice to encrypt sensitive data on a client application?","I need to securely store a user/password pair on a client .NET application (Outlook addin).
Encryption needs to be reversible, and I'd be glad to avoid storing an encryption key in my code, as it's easy to get through disassembly.
In fact, I'd like to access an EFS-like API to delegate the encryption to Windows.
Any hint on this issue? 
","If you have access to .Net 4.0, then I'd recommend the ProtectedData class which encapsulates the windows DPAPI, the recommended way to encrypt data on the client machine in windows.  Otherwise you can P/Invoke the DPAPI directly to do it.
Please note that if you are trying to stop the user from reading the password, then this won't really stop them.  If they have access to their system then the DPAPI won't stop them.  Best bet is to not store the password at all and ask them to login, or if you can connect to something that uses SSPI to do integrated windows authentication then you have the best solution of all.
But it's tough to know what you need without knowing what you are trying to achieve.

","While using base64_encode() isn't necessarily a bad idea, no one has mentioned that stock base64 encoding is not URL-safe as it uses the characters significant in URL syntax.
However, there's a variant that is safe that's used for encoding JWT tokens:
function base64url_encode($bin) {
    return str_replace(['+', '/', '='], ['-', '_', ''], base64_encode($bin));
}

function base64url_decode($str) {

"16786743","Using password salt as IV in password-based encryption","I need to write a simplified encryption API that can easily deal with symmetric encryption, either by using a random generated key or a password-derived key.
The password generation is performed with the PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC() function from the OpenSSL library and using EVP_sha256() as hashing algorithm and a random generated 16-byte salt.
The symmetric encryption is performed with the OpenSSL EVP API.
My question is: how (in)secure is it to use the password derivation salt also as the IV for encryption?
The reason behind this question is that this will allow me to simplify the API and the output stream in the following way:

for the encryption routine, a user would have to provide either the password or the secret key; based on whichever is provided, the code can decide if a key needs to be derived from the password or use the provided key as it is;
similarly, for the decryption  routine, a user would have to provide either the password or the secret key; based on whichever is provided, the key could be re-derived from the password and the IV, which is also acting as a password salt (and is put first in the output stream, right before the ciphertext);
the output stream will consist only of the IV concatenated with the ciphertext, eliminating a separate salt;
the output stream will be the same for a random generated key or a password-derived key.

Note: the API automatically takes care of the salt/IV generation, which is randomly generated for each encryption session, so even if a password is reused, the key is guaranteed to be different.
Thank you in advance for your answers.
","As it happens, I've run into pretty much exactly the same scenario while working on one of my own projects (where a message is encrypted in CBC-mode with a random IV, and the user can either specify a key or a textual password).
Similar questions are discused here and here. To summarize: the purpose of an IV is to ensure that ciphertext remains unique even if the key is reused. As long as you're generating a new IV per message like you said you are, the source of the key doesn't matter as much. Which means you're probably safe reusing the salt as the IV, as far as anyone knows right now. It doesn't even seem like it would even make sense for it to be an issue, because the salt gets put through a cryptographic hash before deriving the key in a different way; as long as you use a good hashing function in PBKDF2 (i.e. SHA-256 as mentioned above), a key so derived is indistinguishable from one which was randomly generated, which in this case it might have been.
However, people uncover unexpected things in the world of cryptanalysis all the time, and straight-up reusing the same data in two places is considered A Bad Thing in principle even if we don't know of any practical problems right this minute. Should you actually be worried about this? At my level of knowledge on cryptanalysis, I'm somewhere between ""maybe"" and ""I don't know,"" which is a little too much uncertainty for my tastes, so I'm going with the ""technically safer"" course of action, which is generating separate IV and salt values. Transmitting both the salt and the IV is a perfectly cromulent security practice, and you have nothing to lose if the user directly inputs the key and the salt goes unused.

It's a conceptual issue. I have a client and a server application and they must connect securely. I have been googling some options to achieve so but I'm not very satisfied to any of them. 

The use of asymmetric keys requires the user to have a public key. This will be an opensource project so hardcoding the key in the source code is not an option. Also, I understood that using a certificate to trade the public key between both parts would avoid a man in the middle, but it makes me a little bit dizzy. I didn't understand very much how it can be accomplished and I don't know where I can get (for free) a valid certificate.
The use of symmetric keys requires both client and server to have the same key. So anyone who downloads the application would be able to access the cryptographer key and use it.

I've read somewhere I could generate a random number that varies from time to time and use it to encrypt data. However, since it is an opensouce application, anyone who is able to read how this number varies over time would also be able to decrypt data, right?
What am I missing here? I appreciate you help. Btw, I'm using Java and it's not a web application.

As such, I am looking for a NFC solution that makes it virtually impossible(or as hard as possible) to clone the chip. 
The current solution I had in mind using the Desfire was to use the supported symmetric authentication to have a memory-locked part of the chip where we would store the product information. Then we would create diversified keys, using a master key, UID of the chip, and some metadata and use that diversified key to conduct the symmetric authentication(more information on it can be found here.
Now, the problem lies in the fact that the symmetric authentication has to be done on an android app, meaning we would have to store the master key on the android app or send it over network to a potentially malicious version of the app. So I was wondering if anyone had a suggestion on how to protect the master key or an entirely different authentication solution to prevent chip cloning using the Mifare Desfire or other similar NFC chips. 
","There is absolutely no way the master key would be safe in the app. 
Instead, use your app only to send the received random number encrypted with the key to your server, and implement the process to decode this info with the master key IN your server, so you can return the response with the new random number encrypted to your app. 
Once you are authenticated, you could also send and receive the info to write.  
This way you can be sure that your key and the information you handle won't be exposed to anyone. 
UPDATE
Since you are using android, then trust me, you are gonna need this library so you can make the validation in the server without getting an 0x1C error (ILLEGAL COMMAND). This error happens when step 2 in authentication is delayed for more than 100 ms.

","You could but it would not be secure.
The usual practice is to use a cryptographically secure random byte sequence for the iv and to prepend the iv to the encrypted data. This allows the decryption function to have the same iv.
By using a random iv if the same message is encrypted with the same key the cipher text will be different, usia the key will allow the same cipher text. Having the same cipher text may give away crucial information.
Trading efficiency for security is not a good idea and if it is not proven that the extra efficiency is needed by benchmark testing it is premature optimization. 
Donald Knuth:

The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.

","You are doubling your security problem.  An ordinary IV can be sent as-is with the cyphertext message, usually prepended to it.  If your IV is the same as the key, then you have to keep the IV as secure as the key, which means you can't do the usual prepending.  You will have to add an 'IV exchange' process to your 'key exchange' process.
All that is extra work.  Easier to use a standard CSPRNG to produce your IV and prepend it.

"43743250","Using libsodium XChaCha20-Poly1305 for large files","I was looking through libsodium, and in particular at the symmetric encryption option XChaCha20-Poly1305. What I can't get my head around is that libsodium appears to provide no ""context/update/finalise"" style of working that you commonly find in crypto libraries.
It is clear from the libsodium that there is ""no practical limit"" to the size of a XChaCha20-Poly1305 message. However in practical terms, if I'm encrypting a multi-GB file, I'm not quite clear as to how you would use libsodium for that ?  Because obviously you would only be passing the contents of the fread buffer to crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt?
IMPORTANT NOTE TO THOSE WHO THINK THIS IS OFF TOPIC
After bowing to peer pressure, I did delete this post. However I have re-opened it at the request of @MaartenBodewes who felt strongly that it was on-topic, and so strongly that he put in some effort into writing an answer. Therefore out of respect for his effort, I have undeleted the post. Please, spare me more ""off-topic"" comments, I've read enough of them!
","In the introduction of libsodium it reads: ""Its goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools.""
Libsodium is therefore a relatively high level library that provides limited access to the underlying structures.

That said, there are some inherent difficulties of encrypting such large files using an authenticated cipher. The problem is that you either need to first verify the authenticity and then start to decrypt or you need to decrypt online before verifying the authentication tag. That in turn means that you have to write / destroy the contents if verification fails.
Generally you can get around that by encrypting in e.g. blocks of 16KiB or so and then add an authentication tag for the block. Of course you would need to make sure that you increase the nonce (making sure that the counter of the stream cipher doesn't repeat). This will add some overhead of course, but nothing spectacular - and you'd have some overhead anyway. The disadvantage is that you cannot decrypt in place anymore (as that would leave gaps).
You could also store all the authentication tags at the end if you want to make a really advanced scheme. Or buffer all the authentication tags in memory and calculate a single (HMAC) tag over all the collected tags.
So calling crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt multiple times could be considered an option. You may want to calculate a file specific key if you go that way so you can start your nonce at zero.

If you just want confidentiality of the file stored you could consider leaving out the authentication tag. In that case you can manually influence the counter used to create the key stream using int crypto_stream_xchacha20_xor_ic:

This permits direct access to any block without having to compute the previous ones.

Obviously you can still add an authentication tag using HMAC-SHA-2 which is also available in libsodium, but this will be rather slower than using poly1305.

Finally, libsodium is open source. If you're exceedingly brave you could go into the gory details and construct your own context/update/finalize. The algorithm certainly supports it (hint: never buffer the authentication tag or nonce during decryption routines if you go this route - directly decrypt).

        return true;
    }else{
        return false;
    }       
}

I then have a method on my SERVER that takes this SealedObject, unseals it and uses the Client's key that it shares with it to decrypt the SealedObject, hopefully producing the same key that the Server sent to the client, it looks like this;
public boolean clientValidate(SealedObject sealedClientReply, String loggedInKey) throws Exception{ 

    String encryptionKey = loggedInKey;
    SecretKeySpec key = new SecretKeySpec(encryptionKey.getBytes(""UTF-8""), ""AES"");

    Cipher dcipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES"");
    dcipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key);

    sealedClientReply.getObject(dcipher); // Server decrypts object
    System.out.println(""I received this from the client: ""+sealedClientReply);
    String decryptedClientReply= (String) sealedClientReply.getObject(dcipher);
    System.out.println(""This is what I received decrypted: ""+decryptedClientReply);


    //if(decryptedClientReply.equals(randString)){
    //  return true;
    //}else{
    //  return false;
    //}
    return true;
}

In my mind this approach worked great, and was very secure. However I now have one major flaw. As you can see in the commented out code in the last method, the decryptedClientReply cannot equal the randString, because the method that is doing this compare doesn't actually know what randString the server sent to the client in the first place.
If I pass the randString into this method, is it still secure? If it is not secure is there another way I could carry out this symmetric approach?

","If you don't want a DBA who is a member of the sysadmin role on that instance to have any access to the keys, then you cannot allow the database to do the encryption.
Even if you try using the PASSWORD option of CREATE SYMMETRIC KEY, the DBA can use Profiler to see the password inside of the SQL statements.  The DBA certainly has access to the Master Key (and may already have a backup of it).
You will need to have your application do the encryption if you want to hide data from DBA's.
Or you can trust your DBA's with the data they're protecting.

","Since this question was asked, SQL Server 2016 has been released and the Enterprise Edition contains a feature called Always Encrypted, which is design with a certificate in a client driver encrypting a column encryption key on the server that performs the encryption. I would recommend putting the ""client"" on a middleware server like IIS for websites and web services where the certificate can be better protected.
A second solution to encryption beyond the reach of the DBA is to introduce an Extensible Key Management system. Support for this is also an Enterprise only feature. An Extensible Key Management system is a separate expansion board or system interfaced with SQL Server to offload all key management and encryption processing that can be put under the administration of a different team than the DBA.
Third, you can design a solution which includes dropping the private key of the certificate and having it in a location that is not accessible to the DBA. When the private key is dropped from a certificate in an encryption hierarchy, then the data can only be encrypted.

I think its more a problem with the objectstreams, everytime i try to work with objectstreams on a socket i got similar problems.
Does someone had an idea whats there happening ?
","You can't use multiple streams over the same socket in general. There are specific cases where it works but in general you're up against unknown buffering which will get your peers out of sync quick as a wink. Redo it with a single ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStreamat each end. If you only need to encrypt certain parts of the stream, look into SealedObject.

I am thinking of using symmetric key encryption for securing data sent through the channel. I will be storing symmetric key inside the application which I think should be secure. (there won't be any handshake of key) 
However, I am not sure whether going for symmetric key encryption over ssl socket will improve connection speed significantly?
My requirement is connection should be established as soon as possible when user launches application.
Can anyone point me in right direction?
","The speed issue with TLS is only associated with the public-key handshake. As Bruno commented TLS uses symmetric encrypion post-handshake.
If public-key handshake adds too much latency for this particular application you should not use the shared-secret scheme that you are proposing with a shared encryption key. If you use the same key for each connection the ciphertext is vulnerable to attacks analyzing ciphertext of multiple sessions. Instead you need to apply a scheme for using a ""shared secret"" (which is never used directly for encryption) to negotiate a unique encryption key for each connection. Plus you need some protocol for data integrity validation on transmitted data.
All of this is tricky business to get right, so if possible you should probably go with TLS.

Do I have the means to unlock it?"". And, sure enough, it does! Assuming that the certificate's private key is encrypted with the database master key, of course You can check sys.key_encryptions to see what encrypts/protects what and sys.openkeys to see what keys you have open in this session.

What is the significance of ""keystore.dat"" - why am I not interfacing directly with the key files under C:\ProgramData\nCipher\Key Management Data\local ?

Thanks!

","Vedat, 
KeySafe doesn't know about JCE (which is ironic as it is itself a Java program).  It shows you the underlying objects in the Security World.  You're getting one actual key file containing your key data (encrypted by the HSM master key) and the plaintext alias (""MyAESKey""), and one file representing the KeyStore.  If you open up your keystore.dat file with a text editor, you'll see that it contains an identifier that shows up in the filename of the other files: this is how the software ties things together.  
The files in Key Management Data\local are completely abstracted away by the JCE KeyStore API implementation: all you need to reference the keys in a KeyStore is the file for it: keystore.dat in your example.

","Not sure if this is still relevant to you, but here comes. These are quite high level and broad questions you are asking, so I'm providing you some general guidance.
I would definitely use asymmetric encryption for this. I'd most likely pick something like RSA OAEP which produces different cipher text on the same input each time thanks to the random padding. This way an attacker won't learn that much from the cipher text that he could manage to intercept.
The key exchange is a trickier topic as your end-user software most likely runs in a browser (being an Angular app). One way to handle this could be to wrap your public key in a certificate that can be verified in the browser.
There are also many other attacks and aspects you need to consider. For example how to protect your system against replay attacks and how to rotate your keys while still meeting your availability requirements. Covering all topics in this answer is not possible them to being too broad, so I leave it here.

I want to know that is there any way when I send digital certificate to browser, the browser forced to use my FooSymmetricAlgorithm for encrypting data? I mean is there any way to add my algorithm to browser?
","
My problem is that how I can tell the browser to use FooSymmetricAlgorithm for session key and encryption.

You have to add your own cipher suite to the browser, which means changes to the source code in NSS (Chrome, Firefox). Then you have to make changes to the TLS stack used by the server and add the cipher suite there. For details how to do this see the implementation of the existing cipher suites in OpenSSL and/or NSS. Since the cipher suite is not IANA assigned you have to use one of the cipher-ids marked for private use.
If everything is done correctly the browser will announce support for the new cipher suite and the server will use it. But all this process is not as simple as adding a root certificate, that means it involves lots of coding, reading existing source code etc.

The second sequence will obtain random data from the HSM's random generator, which is a NIST Special Publication 800-90A compliant Deterministic Random Bit Generator seeded by hardware-based entropy.  This is the same type of random material the HSM uses internally to generate keys.  Since you don't seem to have any HSM protection requirements for the resulting keys, you should be good to go.

","DES supports 56-bit keys, so you can't add another one. Actually 56 bits = 7 bytes, so I supposed ""Zerocool"" worked because all the characters are standard ASCII, and those only take 7 bits each.
That being said...

DES is a really old cipher. A 56-bit key can be easily bruteforced by a modern home computer. You should be using ciphers that support larger keys, like AES.
I read this at the end of the article:


Using DES, you can encrypt or decrypt users' passwords or something else, and you can delve into the algorithm if you like.

Which has got me concerned. Passwords should never be encrypted. On the basis of that statement alone, I would disregard the entire article as useless.

","The line :
static byte[] bytes = ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(""ZeroCool"");
Is not a byte array of the string you're trying to encrypt, it's the key for the encryption process.
It is used in conjunction with the initialization vector (IV) in setting up the encryption. 
writer.Write(originalString);
Is where you should be looking if you're quering the encryption output.

","By having Bob's certificate signed by a trusted third party (Verisign, your corporation, a web of trust, etc.), or by having Bob send his certificate to Alice through a separate secure path out of band (handing her a USB key in person for instance).
Both of these get to the heart of what Bob's certificate is supposed to mean. You only trust that Bob's certificate is Bob's certificate because someone you trust has certified it. That ""someone"" can be Bob himself or a trusted third party who signs Bob's certificate. You only ever can trust this as much as you trust the certifier.

","In cryptography, you are what you know. If you want to avoid MITM, then Alice must have a notion of who ""Bob"" is, which means that Bob must know some data element that an attacker does not know. Here, your attacker is the server, which is ideally located to mount an attack.
So the question is: who is Bob ? How is the server ""not-Bob"" ?
For instance, ""Bob"" may be defined as: ""Bob is a human being who has a driver license with 'Bob' written on it"". Or: ""Bob is that guy I met in a bar and drank a beer with"".
Use of asymmetric cryptography allows you to reduce the problem to a question of trust in a public key. Alice will use what she believes to be Bob's public key. Therefore, Alice only needs some way to make sure that the public key she has is indeed owned by Bob. Ownership of a public key is defined by the control of the corresponding private key: Bob's public key is the key for which the private key is under exclusive control of Bob (e.g. only Bob knows that key, or the private key is in a hardware token -- a smartcard -- that Bob keeps in his wallet).
The basic solution is to have direct exchange of public key. When Alice met Bob in a bar, they gave each other their public keys. Thus, Alice can trust Bob's public key ""by definition"". For easier exchange (especially after a few beers), Alice and Bob may exchange only ""fingerprints"", i.e. hash values computed over the public keys. These values are shorter than public keys (e.g. 128 bits, instead of more than a thousand bits for a typical RSA public key) and are sufficient to verify that a given public key matches. In that setup, the server has a repository for public keys, and Alice and Bob only recompute fingerprints to make sure that the server is not playing phony games.
A more advance solution, which alleviates the need for direct alcohol consumption, is to use certificates. A certificate is a box which contains an identity (e.g. a name, such as ""Bob"") and a public key. The box is signed by a Certification Authority (CA): the CA asserts that the public key really belongs to Bob, by applying its signature. If Alice knows the CA public key, then she can verify the signature on the certificate, and then gain trust in the link between the public key and the identity contained in the certificate.
Certification is delegation of trust. Alice delegates her trust to the CA; supposedly, the CA (let's call it Charlie) went to the bar to meet Bob; through the certificate, Charlie tells Alice: ""yeah, that's really Bob's key, he showed it to me after his third pint"". Things become a bit murky here, because delegating trust is not easy (especially if Charlie is in the habit of binge-drinking). Delegation can go further, when a CA signs a certificate for another CA. Here, Charlie tells to Alice: ""I have not met Bob, but I have met Daphne, who may have met Bob and acted as a CA"". Alice, using both the certificate issued by Charlie to Daphne, and the certificate issued by Daphne to Bob, may verify that chain of signatures.
The tricky point here is that while Alice may know Charlie and trust him in his ability to properly identify Bob when he meets him, even under the influence of a gallon of Guinness, Alice does not know Daphne. In the Alice-Charlie-Daphne-Bob chain, Alice must not only trust that Charlie was reliable (he did identify Daphne properly) but also that Charlie was not gullible, i.e. that Charlie would have refused to sign a certificate for Daphne if Daphne was not herself trustworthy. In practical situations, trust rapidly degrades when it is delegated.
When using certificates, there are mostly two possible structures:

Hierarchical CA: there is a single or a few ""root CA"" which are known by everybody by construction. A CA delegates to another CA (i.e. it signs a certificate with, in the identity, a conventional flag which says: ""this public key may be trusted for the purpose of verifying signatures on certificates"") only within a contractual agreement which establishes the legal responsibilities of both CA with regards to certification. This means that the delegation is formally defined, and it so happens that it is not easy. A lawyer-compatible certification contract, usually called a ""Certification Policy Statement"" (CPS), is a 200-pages long document.
Web of Trust: everybody acts as a CA. In the absence of ""formal trustworthiness"", each individual chain yields only a very small amount of trust. This is meant to be compensated by huge numbers. Alice will accept Bob's key only if she can verify several (many) distinct chains which lead to Bob, going through distinct participants. For instance, Alice will require the Charlie-Daphne-Bob chain but also the Elijah-Fiona-Bob and Gerald-Hillary-Ivan-Bob chains. They're all drunkards, but they may be collectively reliable, in that a fake Bob would have to pay many rounds in order to corrupt one participant of each of the chains that Alice uses (if Alice requires n chains with distinct certificates, then the attacker must corrupt at least n participants).

So the certification business is mostly a matter of procedure: who is a CA, what a CA verifies before issuing (signing) a certificate, how the whole thing stands from a legal point of view, and so on. These procedures are inherently complex and must be supported by details in the certificate format (such as the flag ""this public key is a CA key""). The two main standard formats currently defined are X.509 and PGP. X.509 has much support for the hierarchical CA, and is a very tangled mess of standards, formats, practices and committees. PGP (standardized under the name ""OpenPGP"") has no real support for hierarchical CA; it is meant to be used with a Web of Trust. OpenPGP is simpler than X.509 but more limited, especially if you wish to have a strong legal meaning behind the certificates.
For an IM server, all of this is likely to be overkill. The notion of identity that Alice really wants is probably a notion of repetition: ""that Bob is the same Bob than the one I chatted with yesterday"". Alice does not know Bob beforehand, but talking with him once establishes his identity in Alice's eye. She just want not to be fooled by another Bob. For that, a simple process such as ""Alice's software saves the announced public key of any new chatter, and uses it afterwards"" will do the trick. Remember that the key issue is to properly define what notion of identity you are after.

","First off, I wouldn't tread into this area without doing a bit more research or consulting a security expert.
One really good resource on crypto specifically targeted at developers is: https://www.schneier.com/books/cryptography_engineering/
Now on to answering your question. I would first question whether you actually need to do key-exchange or whether you could get away with setting up a pre-shared secret / key pair on both sides.
Key Exchange
Key exchange is the class of problem you're asking about. There are many implementations:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_exchange
Diffie Hellman is a classic approach which is popular in SSL and TLS:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange
A java implementation example of Diffie Hellman can be found here:
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html#DH2Ex
Pre-shared Key
Key exchange is complex and requires that you own both sides of the communication. Another approach would be to place a shared secret on both ends of the communication. The simplest approach would be to share a symmetric key. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_secret 
A slightly more secure approach would be to use asymmetric keys (public key crypto) where each side generates it's own public private key pair and then you pre-share the public key with the other end. So in the classic example where Alice and Bob want to communicate securely, Alice would give Bob her public key and Bob would encrypt all data sent to Alice with her public key. She could then decrypt it with her private key. This approach has the advantage where if any one side is compromised the attacker can't read messages encrypted for the other side. More details are outlined here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography
A third and slightly more granular approach building on the last one would be to generate a symmetric key per image and encrypt the image with that key. Then encrypt the symmetric key with the public key of the party you're sending the data to. When sending the image over the wire you'd include the encrypted key and the encrypted image. This model is useful because symmetric encryption is faster and better suited for large files like images but combining them in this way you still get the benefits of using public key crypto to protect the transport.
If you happen to be doing this up on AWS, their KMS service would make it very easy to have a shared encryption key across servers. They also use a multi-level crypto approach similar to the last model but in this case the master key is stored on a hardware security module (HSM), which has the added benefit that the master key is never known and can never be pulled off the chip it lives on:
http://aws.amazon.com/kms/

","You can easily do this:
Guid original = Guid.NewGuid();
byte[] encrypted = Encrypt(original, key);
Guid decrypted = Decrypt(encrypted, key);

Any symmetric encoding algorithm will do, from ROT13 on up. However, that's not what you asked for. What you asked for is an algorithm that has two properties:

The encrypt and decrypt algorithms are exactly the same.
The encrypted form of a GUID is also a valid globally unique identifier.

There are plenty of algorithms where the encryption and decryption processes are different but not actually that many where they are exactly the same. The simplest algorithm where encryption and decryption are the same is:

Generate a crypto-strength random one-time pad of the same length as the plaintext.
XOR the plaintext with the pad to produce the ciphertext.
To decrypt, XOR the ciphertext with the pad.

However that algorithm does not necessarily maintain the property that the ciphertext is a valid GUID.
Can you explain why it is that you need the ciphertext to be a valid GUID? The property that a GUID has to have is that it needs to be globally unique; how are you planning on guaranteeing global uniqueness?  What stops you from encrypting one GUID that you generated into another GUID that someone else has generated unbeknownst to you?
More generally, can you explain what problem you are trying to solve in the first place? Nine times out of ten that I see someone trying to use cryptography, they're using it for the wrong purpose.

        symCrypto.Mode = CipherMode.CBC;               
        symCrypto.Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7;
        byte[] salt = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(""dummy dummy dummy dummy test"");
        Rfc2898DeriveBytes key = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(passphrase, salt);
        symCrypto.Key = key.GetBytes(symCrypto.KeySize / 8);
        symCrypto.IV = key.GetBytes(symCrypto.BlockSize / 8);

        return symCrypto;
    }

To encrypt the string for the sake of an example:
private string Encrypt(RijndaelManaged rm, string text)
    {
        byte[] encrypted;
        // Create a decrytor to perform the stream transform.
            ICryptoTransform encryptor = rm.CreateEncryptor(rm.Key, rm.IV);
        using (MemoryStream msEncrypt = new MemoryStream())
            {
                using (CryptoStream csEncrypt = new CryptoStream(msEncrypt, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write))
                {
                    using (StreamWriter swEncrypt = new StreamWriter(csEncrypt))
                    {
                        //Write all data to the stream.
                        swEncrypt.Write(text);
                    }
                    encrypted = msEncrypt.ToArray();
                }
            }
        return BitConverter.ToString(encrypted);
    }

So then do this
RijndaelManaged rm1 = CreateSymmetricKey(""there is something weird happening"");
RijndaelManaged rm2 = new RijndaelManaged();
// copy ALL public properties to the new instance so that it has the same parameters
rm2.BlockSize = rm1.BlockSize; // 128
rm2.FeedbackSize = rm1.FeedbackSize; // 128
rm2.KeySize = rm1.KeySize; // 256
rm2.Mode = rm1.Mode; // CBC
rm2.Padding = rm1.Padding; // PKCS7
rm2.IV = rm1.IV;
rm2.Key = rm1.Key;
// Encryption
string cypher1 = Encrypt(rm1, ""this is a test 6"");  // length equal to BlockSize
string cypher2 = Encrypt(rm2, ""this is a test 6"");  // length equal to BlockSize
string cypher11 = Encrypt(rm1, ""this is a test"");  // length less than BlockSize
string cypher21 = Encrypt(rm2, ""this is a test"");  // length less than BlockSize

I am getting that cyper1 == cypher2 and cypher11 != cypher21 also rm1.GetHashCode() != rm2.GetHashCode() yet all public parameters are the same!
I also dumped all the public properties of both instances to see if I was missing something but not, all values are the same.
","You should not use GetHashCode() in this way. For classes that did not override the base object.GetHashCode() implementation, it will return the integer handler of this specific instance.
Since the handle for two different instances will always be different this will never match.
Also GetHashCode() never actually guarantees uniqueness, it's merely meant to be used as a light weight pre check, before the actual equality is tested.
This is heavily used in any kind of Hashing data structure like Dictionary etc.
For more info on this topic:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object.gethashcode.aspx
I also executed your code and for me the following was the case:
cyper1 == cypher2 and cypher11 == cypher21

I'm pretty sure the issue was the comparison of GetHashCode().

","The goal of being able to use a LIKE clause and its wildcards on securely encrypted data is a set of two mutually exclusive desires.
You can securely encrypt your data, OR you can use a LIKE clause with wildcards.  You cannot do both at once, because the LIKE clause itself would bypass the encryption!
SELECT * WHERE data LIKE 'a%'
SELECT * WHERE data LIKE 'b%'
...
SELECT * WHERE data LIKE '_a%'
SELECT * WHERE data LIKE '_b%'
...
SELECT * WHERE data LIKE '__a%'
SELECT * WHERE data LIKE '__b%'
...

If you securely encrypt the data in the database, then you need to pull ALL of it back local, decrypt it all, and then do your wildcard searches on the decrypted data.

","You're thinking about it the wrong way; the salt and password together is used as the key, while there is a magic string that's the data (the password is not the data). Without the key, no decryption. This is then iterated over (which is what bcrypt does).

","A cipher algorithm like blowfish can be used as part of a hashing algorithm. Blowfish is just a ""building block"" and can be used for different purposes. It can be implemented as an encryption/decryption tool, or as the cryptographic primitive of a hash algorithm. This does not mean that you are suddenly able to reverse a hashing algorithm.
The plain fact that the output of the hashing algorithm is always a constant length is a giveaway that it cannot be reversed. You cannot encrypt an infinite number of potential input values in a reversible way into a fixed length output. The algorithm is by necessity lossy.
As a simple illustration, blowfish can be used like this to encrypt data (which can subsequently be decrypted):
ABCD EFGH IJKL MNOP ...
  |    |    |    |
  v    v    v    v
NPCQ JQ0C  MPZW LKAQ

Each block of the input is turned into cipher text individually by blowfish. That is why blowfish is called a block cipher (as opposed to a stream cipher which would process the input as a stream, not as a set of blocks of fixed length). The result of this operation are a bunch of blocks which can be reversed. The output is of the same length as the input (plus padding to fill a block where necessary).
A hash function using blowfish works like this:
ABCD EFGH        IJKL        MNOP ...
  |    |           |           |
  v    v           v           v
NPCQ JQ0C        MPZW        LKAQ
  |    |           |           |
  +----+--> PMQZ --+--> OLMQ --+--> UALG ...

The output of each block is run through a compression function which combines two blocks into one. The output of the first two blocks are combined (into PMQZ), then this value is combined with the output of the third block (into OLMQ) and so on. The output of the last compression is the result of the hash.
As you see, blowfish is used internally as a cryptographic cipher, but its output is combined with a lossy compression function which makes it impossible to reverse the output.

"53559476","Decrypt Rijndael 256 Block Size with BouncyCastle","We have a helper class for doing encryption that, if I'm going to be honest, was probably copied from Stack Overflow years ago. 
Currently we're trying to port some of this code to .NET Core and we're finding that it doesn't work because the .NET Core implementation of RijndaelManaged doesn't support a 256 blocksize. From what I've read, it seems like BouncyCastle should still support it, but I can't get it to work. The ""unencrypted"" text is just a bunch of gibberish.

Thanks in advance! I'm sure I'm doing something dumb, but I'm not a cryptographic expert, and I'm having trouble finding good BouncyCastle examples.
","I believe your problem is in the line
cipher.Init(true, keyParamWithIV);
the first parameter initializes the cipher for encryption if true and for decryption if false.  If you set it to false it should work.

What is the standard method for dealing with this situation? Perhaps fill in the end of the string with 0s? Presumably there's a more elegant way?
Thanks in advance.
","There are quite a number of padding mechanisms (wikipedia) that you can choose from. The algorithms vary from simply appending zeros to the end to a padding mechanism that can be validated and/or removed.
Alternatively, you can use the OFB mode of operation (wikipedia) to convert a block cipher into a stream cipher, and get rid of the requirement for padding.

"10884064","Is the same key derived providing the same salt and password using Rfc2898DeriveBytes","I read this tutorial about encryption in .NET
it uses Rfc2898DeriveBytes to create a random key to be used by symmetric algorithm . but it doesn't save the key . and later in decryption method it supplies the same password and salt and decrypts the text .
does it mean supplying the same salt and password to Rfc2898DeriveBytes could derived the same key ? no need to save the key and just save salt and password ?
","Yes, that is correct.  Identical inputs to  Rfc2898DeriveBytes provide identical outputs.   Otherwise, decryption would not be possible. 
The article you reference uses the term ""random"" loosely. The output of Rfc2898DeriveBytes is not random: but it has high entropy.

I am using SQL Server 2012. How can i decrypt this value in SQL OR C#?
","This essentially requires to follow below mentioned step:

Verify SQL Server Master Key
Create a Master Key Encryption password
Create a self signed certificate


A certificate is a digitally signed security object that contains a public (and optionally a private) key for SQL Server

Create Symmetric Key.
Encrypt the column(needs to be varbinary type)

To add records:
sample syntax:
OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY SymmetricKey1 DECRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE Certificate1;
-- Performs the update of the record 
   INSERT INTO dbo.test VALUES 
    (x, EncryptByKey(Key_GUID('SymmetricKey1'), CONVERT(varchar,'4545-58478-1245')));

My question is: Is following communication secure?

Adding a User:

Client requests sign up

Server creates public key and sends it to the client.

Client encrypts username+password with public key and sends it to the server.

Server accepts connection, hashes salted password, stores it in a keystore and
informs client about accepted sign up. (the decision, if a client will be
accepted or declined will be made by the user of the phone)


Communication for registered users:

Client requests service

Server creates public key and sends it to the client.

Client sends username+password+symmetric communication key to server.

Server verifies username and password using stored hash and salt. Server starts
symmetrically encrypted communication with client.



RSA will be used for asymmetric and AES will be used for symmetric en/decryption.

A severe error occurred on the current command. The results, if any, should be discarded.

alter master key add encryption by service master key
the morning after but in the meantime the backend was not working correctly. So the failover didn't really did its job (because I had to do something manually to get everything working again).

","What i think I'm reading is that you have some sort of HA technology in play (e.g. availability groups). If that's the case, care needs to be taken to ensure that both sides of the topology can open the database master key.
Fortunately, it's fairly easy to do that. You can backup and restore service master keys (SMK). So, you'll backup the SMK from the secondary node and restore it to the primary node. SQL Server will decrypt anything currently encrypted with the old key and re-encrypt with the new.

Here is how I tried to descrypt it using openssl:
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -salt -in encrypted.txt -out decrypted.txt -d -pass pass:<the key given in rails> -a

This just shows bad magic number
","Trying to decrypt data encrypted in a different system will not work unless you are aware and deal with the many intricate details of how both systems do the cryptography. Although both Rails and the openssl command line tool use the OpenSSL libraries under the hood for their crypto operations, they both use it in their own distinct ways that are not directly interoperable.
If you look close to the two systems, you'll see that for example:

Rails message encryptor not only encrypts the message but also signs it
Rails encryptor uses Marshal to serialize the input data
the openssl enc tool expects the encrypted data in a distinct file format with a Salted__<salt> header (this is why you get the bad magic number message from openssl)
the openssl tool must be properly configured to use the same ciphers as Rails encryptor and key generator, as openssl defaults are different from Rails defaults
the default ciphers configuration changed significantly since Rails 5.2.

With this general info, we can have a look at a a practical example. It is tested in Rails 4.2 but should work equally up to Rails 5.1.
Anatomy of a Rails-encrypted message
Let me start with a slightly amended code that you presented. The only changes there are to preset the password and salt to static values and print a lot of debug info:
def encrypt_text(text_to_encrypt)
  password = ""password"" # the password to derive the key
  salt = ""saltsalt"" # salt must be 8 bytes

  key = ActiveSupport::KeyGenerator.new(password).generate_key(salt, 32)

  puts ""salt (hexa) = #{salt.unpack('H*').first}"" # print the saltin HEX
  puts ""key (hexa) = #{key.unpack('H*').first}"" # print the generated key in HEX

  crypt = ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor.new(key)
  output = crypt.encrypt_and_sign(text_to_encrypt)
  puts ""output (base64) = #{output}""
  output
end

encrypt_text(""secret text"")

When you run this, you'll get something like the following output:
salt (hexa) = 73616c7473616c74
key (hexa) = 196827b250431e911310f5dbc82d395782837b7ae56230dce24e497cf07b6518
output (base64) = SGRTUXYxRys1N1haVWNpVWxxWTdCMHlyMk15SnQ0dWFBOCt3Z0djWVdBZz0tLTkrd1hBNWJMVm9HcnptZ3loOG1mNHc9PQ==--80d091e8799776113b2c0efd1bf75b344bf39994

The last line (output of the encrypt_and_sign method) is a combination of two parts separated by -- (see source): 

the encrypted message (Base64-encoded) and 
the message signature (Base64-encoded).

The signature is not important for encryption so let's take a look in the first part - let's decode it in Rails console:
> Base64.strict_decode64(""SGRTUXYxRys1N1haVWNpVWxxWTdCMHlyMk15SnQ0dWFBOCt3Z0djWVdBZz0tLTkrd1hBNWJMVm9HcnptZ3loOG1mNHc9PQ=="")
=> ""HdSQv1G+57XZUciUlqY7B0yr2MyJt4uaA8+wgGcYWAg=--9+wXA5bLVoGrzmgyh8mf4w==""

You can see that the decoded message again consists of two Base64-encoded parts separated by -- (see source):

the encrypted message itself
the initialization vector used in the encryption

Rails message encryptor uses the aes-256-cbc cipher by default (note that this has changed since Rails 5.2). This cipher needs an initialization vector, which is randomly generated by Rails and must be present in the encrypted output so that we can use it together with the key to decipher the message. 
Moreover, Rails does not encrypt the input data as a simple plain text, but rather a serialized version of the data, using the Marshal serializer by default (source). If we decrypted such serialized value with openssl, we would  still get a slightly garbled (serialized) version of the initial plain text data. That's why it will be more appropriate to disable serialization while encrypting the data in Rails. This can be done by passing a parameter to the encryption method:
  # crypt = ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor.new(key)
  crypt = ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor.new(key, serializer: ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor::NullSerializer)


A re-run of the code yields output that is slightly shorter than the previous version, because the encrypted data has not been serialized now:
salt (hexa) = 73616c7473616c74
key (hexa) = 196827b250431e911310f5dbc82d395782837b7ae56230dce24e497cf07b6518
output (base64) = SUlIWFBjSXRUc0JodEMzLzhXckJzUT09LS1oZGtPV1ZRc2I5Wi8zOG01dFNOdVdBPT0=--58bbaf983fd20459062df8b6c59eb470311cbca9

Finally, we must find out some info about the encryption key derivation procedure. The source tells us that the KeyGenerator uses the pbkdf2_hmac_sha1 algorithm with 2**16 = 65536 iterations to derive the key from the password / secret.
Anatomy of an openssl encrypted message
Now, a similar investigation is needed on the openssl side to learn the details of its decryption process. First, if you encrypt anything using the openssl enc tool, you will find out that the output has a distinct format:
Salted__<salt><encrypted_message>

It begins with the Salted__ magic string, then followed by the salt (in hex form) and finally followed by the encrypted data. To be able to decrypt any data using this tool, we must get our encrypted data into the same format.
The openssl tool uses the EVP_BytesToKey (see source) to derive the key by default but can be configured to use the pbkdf2_hmac_sha1 algorithm using the -pbkdf2 and -md sha1 options. The number of iterations can be set using the -iter option. 
How to decrypt Rails-encrypted message in openssl
So, finally we have enough information to actually try to decrypt a Rails-encrypted message in openssl.
First we must decode the first part of the Rails-encrypted output again to get the encrypted data and the initialization vector:
> Base64.strict_decode64(""SUlIWFBjSXRUc0JodEMzLzhXckJzUT09LS1oZGtPV1ZRc2I5Wi8zOG01dFNOdVdBPT0="")
=> ""IIHXPcItTsBhtC3/8WrBsQ==--hdkOWVQsb9Z/38m5tSNuWA==""

Now let's take the IV (the second part) and convert it to a hexa string form, as that is the form that openssl needs:
> Base64.strict_decode64(""hdkOWVQsb9Z/38m5tSNuWA=="").unpack(""H*"").first
=> ""85d90e59542c6fd67fdfc9b9b5236e58""  # the initialization vector in hex form

Now we need to take the Rails-encrypted data and convert it to the format that openssl will recognize, i.e. prepend it with the magic string and salt and Base64-encode it again:
> Base64.strict_encode64(""Salted__"" + ""saltsalt"" + Base64.strict_decode64(""IIHXPcItTsBhtC3/8WrBsQ==""))
=> ""U2FsdGVkX19zYWx0c2FsdCCB1z3CLU7AYbQt//FqwbE="" # encrypted data suitable for openssl

Finally, we can construct the openssl command to decrypt the data:
$ echo  ""U2FsdGVkX19zYWx0c2FsdCCB1z3CLU7AYbQt//FqwbE="" | 
> openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -iv 85d90e59542c6fd67fdfc9b9b5236e58 \
>   -pass pass:password -pbkdf2 -iter 65536 -md sha1 -a
secret text

And voilá, we successfully decrypted the initial message!
The openssl parameters are as follows:

-aes-256-cbc sets the same cipher as Rails uses for encryption
-d stands for decryption
-iv passes the initialization vector in the hex string form
-pass pass:password sets the password used to derive the encryption key to ""password""
-pbkdf2 and -md sha1 set the same key derivation algorithm as is used by Rails (pbkdf2_hmac_sha1)
-iter 65536 sets the same number of iterations for key derivation as was done in Rails
-a allows to work with Base64-encoded encrypted data - no need to handle raw bytes in files

By default openssl reads from STDIN, so we simply pass the encrypted data (in proper format) to openssl using echo.
debugging
In case you hit any problems when decrypting with openssl, it is useful to add the -P parameter to the command line, which outputs debugging info about the cipher / key parameters:
$ echo ... | openssl ... -P
salt=73616C7473616C74
key=196827B250431E911310F5DBC82D395782837B7AE56230DCE24E497CF07B6518
iv =85D90E59542C6FD67FDFC9B9B5236E58

The salt, key, and iv values must correspond to the debugging values printed by the original code in the encrypt_text method printed above. If they are different, you know you are doing something wrong...
Now, I guess you can expect similar problems when trying to decrypt the message in go but I think you have some good pointers now to start.

"28846702","What type of encryption do I need?","Ok, the original task is to track users among 2 ""friendly"" web-sites who are able to share users cookies (lets say, I have example.com and my friend has mysite.com and also he has a domain simple.example.com so he can set cookies on .example.com).
To track users activity we want to set unique cookie, this cookie should be unique and 32 bytes long (ascii). Quite simple from this point of view and can be implemented as such:
md5(microtime)

and that's it, but now we have new constraints:

we should be able to tell who exactly has set the cookie: exmaple.com engine or mysite.com engine
32 bytes longs is a must, still
we should be able to encrypt timestamp (when cookies was issued)
first and last character of the resulting cookie value should be different so we can do A/B testing basing on the cookie (so we could always say if last character of the cookie is ""> K"", show this users ""feature A"")

Given that the resulting string should always be 32 or less characters long and data should be encrypted and decrypted (not by users, of course) and the string should be unique for the users, it makes the task quite complex.
My thought and questions:

we should use symmetric key encryption (solves constraints 1 and 3), but it this case how do we ensure that resulting string is no longer than 32 chars (constraint 2)?
is there other solution on the problem given that amount of data we need to encrypt is: timestamp and microseconds (14 bytes), site-issuer flag (1 byte) = 15 bytes total

My first take was to pack data into binary string and than base64-encode it. The result would be 8-chars long base64-encoded string:
def encode():
    base64( pack('Lv', timestamp, microseconds) )

Add site-issuer flag and chars at the beginning and the end:
def getCookie():
    rand('a'...'Z') + encode() + issuerFlagChar() + rand('a'...'Z')

So, the result is 11 chars long and we meet constraint 2 easily.
But the problem is: this algorithm is not secure for sure, I'm not sure if the resulting string for millions of websites users is unique.
I wonder if I could use DES or AES for this purpose but I'm not sure that the resulting string will always meet constraint 2 (resulting string should be no longer than 32 ascii chars).
Is there symmetric key algorithms that ensure something like ""if you encrypt N bytes with M-bytes key you will have resulting data length of Math.Ceil(N*2+1/M) bytes""? So the resulting length would be predictable?
","Setting aside the fact that you should indeed consult a security consultant, the actual question you pose can easily be answered:

Is there symmetric key algorithms that ensure something like ""if you encrypt N bytes with M-bytes key you will have resulting data length of Math.Ceil(N*2+1/M) bytes""? So the resulting length would be predictable?

Yes there are. And they are called Block Ciphers. 
By definition, every block cipher has the property that the length of the ciphertext is equal to the length of the plain text. In practice most block ciphers (inclusing DES and AES) cheat a bit because they require the plaintext to be padded to the length of the block before they start encrypting. 
In other words, given a plaintext of N bytes and a block size of B, the ciphertext will have a length of B*(Math.ceil(N/B)) bytes.
Note how I am talking about the block size, which is different from the key size. The key size is actually irrelevant in this case.
For example, AES uses a block size of 128 bits, or 16 bytes. This means that if your plain text is between 17 and 32 bytes long, AES will guarantee that your ciphertext is 32 bytes long. This is independent from the key size you choose, which can be one of 128, 192 or 256 bits (16, 24 or 32 bytes).

","First of all, you need to know whether you want to encrypt or sign the data.
Encrypting will prevent users from seeing the data, but they are still able to modify it in some ways depending on the encryption type. For example, decrypting a modified ciphertext will simply give corrupted data, it won't fail. 
Signing, on the other hand, will prevent users from modifying the data, that is, your code will be able to detect the data has been modified. A simple algorithm for this is HMAC.
I'll assume you want both. My solution below does both.
Your cookie must be 32 bytes long, which is 256 bits. We are going to use 128 bits for encrypted data and 128 bits for the HMAC. 
For the data, I will encode the timestamp as a 64bit integer (more than enough even if you want to store it to microsecond precision). The site that issued the cookie can be stored as 1 bit if you have two sites, but I'll store it in a 32bit integer because we have plenty of space. Same for a tag you can use for a/b testing.
All the data is exactly 128 bits, 16 bytes. This is the exact size of an AES block. So, we will encrypt it with AES!
The other 16 bytes will be a MAC of the ciphertext (Encrypt then MAC). I used HMAC-SHA256, which has 256bits of output. We only have room for 128bits, so I have truncated it. In theory this makes it less secure, but in practice 128bit is big enough to make a brute-force attempt impossible.
Decrypting the cookie is the reverse process: calculate the HMAC of the given ciphertext and check it matches the given MAC. If so, proceeed to decrypt the ciphertext and unpack the data.
Here's the code:
from struct import pack, unpack
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import hashlib
import hmac


AES_KEY = hashlib.sha256(b""secret key 1 asdfasdf"").digest()
HMAC_KEY = hashlib.sha256(b""secret key 2 asdfasdf"").digest()

# timestamp: 64bit unix timestamp
# site: 32bit integer, which site issued the cookie
# tag: 32bit integer, tag used for a/b testing.
def encrypt_cookie(timestamp, site, tag):

    # Pack the data
    data = pack('QII', timestamp, site, tag)

    # Encrypt it
    aes = AES.new(AES_KEY, AES.MODE_ECB, 'This is an IV456')
    ciphertext = aes.encrypt(data)

    # Do HMAC of the ciphertext
    sig = hmac.new(HMAC_KEY, ciphertext, hashlib.sha256).digest()
    sig = sig[:16]   # Truncate to only first 16 bytes.

    return ciphertext + sig

def decrypt_cookie(cookie):

    # Do HMAC of the ciphertext
    sig = hmac.new(HMAC_KEY, cookie[:16], hashlib.sha256).digest()
    sig = sig[:16]   # Truncate to only first 16 bytes.

    # Check the HMAC is ok
    if sig != cookie[16:]:
        raise Exception(""Cookie has been tampered with"")

    # Decrypt it
    aes = AES.new(AES_KEY, AES.MODE_ECB, 'This is an IV456')
    data = aes.decrypt(cookie[:16])

    # unPack the data
    timestamp, site, tag = unpack('QII', data)

    return timestamp, site, tag

cookie = encrypt_cookie(1, 2, 3)
print(len(cookie))  # prints: 32
print(decrypt_cookie(cookie))  # prints: 1, 2, 3

# Change a single byte in the cookie, the last one
cookie = cookie[:31] + b'0'
print(decrypt_cookie(cookie))  # raises the exception

I'm curious to know why the cookie must be 32bytes though. Seems a weird requirement, and if you didn't have it, you'd be able to use many libraries that are designed to solve exactly this problem, such as Django signing if you're using Django.

","Your requirements are mutually exclusive.  That kind of metadata will leak a huge amount of information about the document content, to the point it can't be called secure.
Furthermore, encrypting individual words is futile.  The difficulty of breaking encryption is usually said to be as difficult as breaking the key, but this assumes the information content in the plaintext is greater than that in the key.  For single words, that certainly isn't true.

","First, I suggest different tags.  It sounds like you're really interested in offloading searching to a server in a cryptographically secure way (such that the server doesn't have access to the plaintext and such that the client need not transfer the entire index).
Issues:

An attacker being able to figure out which words are in the index (and which are not) could be an issue for you.  You should state whether it is as a part of your requirements.
An attacker being able to figure out which items in the index occur more frequently could be an issue for you.  You should state whether it is as a part of your requirements.
An attacker being able to associate words with a document could be an issue for you.  You should state whether it is as a part of your requirements.
An attacker may be able to subvert the server entirely and observe queries / retrievals.  You should state security needs in this circumstance as well.
Probably others I haven't thought of.

I'm assuming that you're designing your own, but there is probably some prior art, research, etc. that would be smarter than I am below:
For the first, I suggest that you should hash the words, combining the plaintext with a secret (not shared with the index server) before hashing, and truncating the hash to the point where it is likely to be non-unique in the index.  This costs you hash efficiency, but helps prevent an attacker from using the hash as a plaintext equivalent or experimentally determining the secret
For the second and third, you should encrypt any indexed data (such as counts or document+position) and decrypt it on the client.  This may cost you latency.
For the fourth, you'd want to consider concealing real requests inside groups of unrelated requests, things like that, but you'd want a lot of math to make sure you weren't still vulnerable to statistical analysis.
For the fifth, do some web research.  I'm confident there will be stuff out there, and this is a pretty specific (and less common) need, so you'll want someone who put more thought into it than I just have.

So, I could do an every-other-byte encryption performed inside the Transform methods and as a batch. I believe this would eliminate the overhead I am getting.
FINAL UPDATE (Solved my own issue, still open to ideas!)
Incrementing the loop rate inside the Transform method has worked!
What I've done is the following and it seems to work well:
ITransformationModule moduleA = TransformationFactory.GetModuleInstance(""Subspace28"");
ITransformationModule moduleB = TransformationFactory.GetModuleInstance(""Ataxia"");
moduleA.IncrementInterval = 2;
moduleB.IncrementInterval = 2;
moduleA.Transform(true, buffer, 0, buffer.Length);
moduleB.Transform(true, buffer, 1, buffer.Length);

My idea involves consolidating a number my algorithms into a larger one. For instance, you call X.Encrypt() then it uses A.Encrypt(), B.Encrypt(), C.Encrypt() etc. When you perform this kind of operation one byte per A, B, C method call the method overhead becomes killer. Going from a few ms to several minutes. So, any questions?
I am merely looking for code design tips and tricks to maybe lessen the issue.
Thanks ahead of time.

moduleA.Transform(true, buffer, 0, buffer.Length);

//slow

","Would something like this work? Of course you would have to modify it to fit your encryption arguments and return types....
static class Encryptor
{
    delegate void Transform(bool b, byte[] buffer, int index, int length);
    static Transform[] transformers = new Transform[3];

    static Encryptor()
    {
        transformers[0] = (b, buffer, index, length) => { /*Method A*/ };
        transformers[1] = (b, buffer, index, length) => { /*Method B*/ };

    }

    public static void Encrypt(bool b, byte[] buffer)
    {
        int length = buffer.Length;
        int nTransforms = transformers.Length;
        for (int i = 0; i < length;)

Encryptor.Encrypt(yourBoolean, yourBuffer);

But it looks like certain hex values will result in errors if I try to encode that character using encodeURIComponent.

var decoded = encodedChar.charCodeAt(0) ^ xor;

This is a very simplified version, where the xor value is static. In the real case the xor value will be calculated based on a bunch of variables.
Assume ""/someuri"" is not built by me, and wasn't really originally built to receive encrypted data, I am merely trying to use this URI.
Also, my encryption algorithm can be changed. The xor value will be generated using a fairly simple algorithm using a user entered password, and the position of the character.
I was thinking of one way to make this work would be to reduce the total number of possible output characters and perform a mapping of some kind... but I can't really picture the code for that.

","If you want the average people not to see the text, just use a POST request or Base64.
As for actual security this is completely useless. An attacker doesn't need to know what the plaintext is, all he needs to know what
the user sent to your site and send the same data back themself. The only way to prevent this is to use SSL everywhere on your site. 
If they wanted, they could use your algorithm found on the page's source code to decrypt it.

It is kinda terrible that Javascript strings don't validate their state right away as it could be done basically for free. Javascript
strings are associated with UTF-16* encoding where not all sequences are valid. It is not valid to have a unit value between 0xD800 - 0xDBFF
when it is not immediatelly followed be 0xDC00 - 0xDFFF. And it is not valid to have 0xDC00 - 0xDFFF if the previous unit value is not 
0xD800 - 0xDBFF.
Many things can lead strings to violate this and because strings don't validate themselves you will only see an error much later.
You could always go 8 bits at a time and it'll work.
var xor = 0xDDCE;

var input = ""t"",
    output = """",
    i = 0,
    ch;

while( isFinite( ch = input.charCodeAt(i++) ) {

    output += String.fromCharCode(
        (xored & 0xFF00) >> 8,
        xored & 0xFF
    );

//output is ""Ýº"", or 0x00DD 0x00BA, each char is always 0x00XX

","You are using a symmetric encryption, where storing the blocksize, blockmode and keysize would be safe, since you don't (mustn't) make keys available as you stated.
But all such params are in general useful to attackers. If the file cannot easily be associated with a cipher and used params (or the software respectively), an attacker would have considerably more work to do and that's what encryption basically is for. A cipher is secure, while (and because) everyone can see how it works. Additionally trying to hide some information can also add some security.

AES has a fixed block size of 128bits, which itself is not a critical information, knowing of AES itself already. So this one is not needed inside the file header.
The keysize is given by the key itself, so it can be left out too.
The blockmode is the remaining parameter. Just never use ECB. Permanently use a single blockmode like OCB and you don't need to store it in the file aswell.

Predefining all params at both sides is a solution, if you don't intend to change them per file.
Error checking can be done using checksums, which are also critical information, so you may encrypt them together with the data or provide them together with the key.
Perhaps, following approaches can help if you have to transmit the params anyway:

Transmit params in the key file, if you're up to define the format yourself and the keys were distributed on a per file basis.
You could also define different settings by mapping them to some randomly defined enumerators, which don't provide valuable information without knowing the software.

","You're using KeyGenerator twice; once for encryption and once for decryption. This class generates a new random key. With symmetric ciphers you need to use the same key for encryption and decryption (hence the name).
In general you should use the following classes for the following purposes:
For symmetric keys (e.g. AES, HMAC):

KeyGenerator: brand new secret (symmetric) keys;
SecretKeyFactory: decoding secret (symmetric) keys, for instance generated by the method Key#getEncoded() implemented by most key classes;

And for asymmetric public / private key pairs (e.g. RSA):

KeyPairGenerator: brand new public / private asymmetric key pairs;
KeyFactory: decoding public / private (asymmetric) keys from a stored key format, for instance generated by the method Key#getEncoded() implemented by most key classes;

Both symmetric and asymmetric keys may be stored in key stores:

KeyStore: storing keys / certificates in a key container such as PKCS#12 key stores;

Finally there are some other options for creating keys:

KeyAgreement: establishing a key by a key agreement function such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange;
Cipher#unwrap: unwrapping (decrypting) keys created using Cipher#wrap (or a similar function on another platform) with another key.


You should probably either store and retrieve the key in a KeyStore - which you can load / save to file. Note that not all key stores are created equal; Java 9 expanded the functionality of PKCS#12 key stores and made them the default. You code also encode the key and use a SecretKeyFactory to decode it again.
Or you can just cheat and reuse the SecretKey instance you generated during encryption, and implement key storage later. That would be good for testing purposes. In the end you need to share the key for symmetric encryption.
And yes, the IV needs to be identical on both sides. Usually it is just stored in front of the ciphertext. The IV should be unique for each encryption, so you have to use the random number generator over there.

","A realm is just a virtual collection of security principals. SASL uses the same notion. For instance, in Windows a domain is a Kerberos realm. Dependening on your case a big realm would make sense. Linking realms reaquires two-way trusts between them. Means more administration overhead for you.
What actual problem do you have?

","The explicit notion of “realm” allows for scaling and federation of Kerberos systems. Imagine two groups A and B which started using Kerberos independently. Each has a completely separate Kerberos system, or realm: a collection of security principals (users and software services) connected to a common Kerberos authentication service, which allows them to authenticate to one another.
Now, these groups want to work together; suppose B has a web server and it wants to allow authenticated access to members of A. This poses a practical problem: the two Kerberos systems do not interoperate. In order to allow authentication, they either have to join the web server to realm A when it already has an identity in realm B, or every user in A has to join B as well (by obtaining a new principal name in B, with a new password, authenticating multiple times and switching between identities depending on what they want to access). It's a mess.
The solution to this is federation: group B decides to trust A’s identification of its own users, rather than requiring them to register independently with B. This is accomplished by giving to A a key which allows its Kerberos system to directly issue credentials good in B’s realm. This is called a one-way realm trust (B trusting A). The B web server can distinguish between users in the different groups, because the realms appear explicitly in the principal names: user@A vs user@B.
To help with the scaling aspect, Kerberos 5 has automatic support for hierarchical realm trusts. If you have three realms FOO, A.FOO, and B.FOO, FOO trusts A.FOO, and B.FOO trusts FOO, then user@A.FOO can authenticate to a service in B.FOO without the realm administrators having to set up a direct trust between A.FOO and B.FOO: Kerberos will follow the trust relationships up and down automatically.

","I ran into the same error.  Essentially this property was removed sometime after 2.0.3 of Spring WS when they decided to upgrade to Apache WSS4J 1.6 and they couldn't figure out how to create a callback handler on Securement actions.  So they basically just removed it with no warning or explanation and without updating their documentation.
Javadoc for Wss4JSecurityInterceptor
Typical move by the Spring folks.  Here is an issue in their JIRA tracker where they are labeling this as a ""Feature Improvement"" slated for 2.3.
Luckily however somebody there posted a potential workaround until this happens.  He is creating his own Securement Callback Handler class and his own custom Wss4JSecurityInterceptor class that adds this property.  It is worth looking into.

"37340414","How to encrypt a file using Crypto API with multiple threads?","I am trying to encrypt a file using multiple threads and Crypto API / AES256 / CBC mode / NO IV (initialization vector) is used.
I am dividing the file into as many number of threads. The thread which gets the last block of the file, does a CryptEncrypt passing Final as true.
Following the approach suggested here: Each thread uses a duplicated key.
Additionally, each thread opens the source file in shared read mode and starts reading from the offset allotted, keeping encrypting and writing to the destination file (again opened in shared write mode) as appropriate offsets.
The output file which i get in case of single and multi threaded is not the same and hash mismatches. What is that i am doing wrong?
","You cannot do that. IV or chaining mode is irrelevant here (though some chaining mode allows parallelism - but is would be its implementation). Consider performing encryption of following text:
""Block cipher mode of operation""

Somehow you divide it this way (2 threads):

""Block cipher mo""
"" de of operation""

How can you be sure that it gets executed (by OS scheduler) in the same sequence? If you divide it into 3 threads, it may be:

""Block ciphe""
""r mode o""
""f operation""

but it may get executed as:

""r mode o""
""f operation""
""Block ciphe""

The end result, as you can guess, would be different!
Also, with CBC mode, the result depends on previous outcome, a mentioned here. See, on the right side, CBC is not parallelizable.

I have a little problem understandig the right use of IV.
AES is only safe against Known-Plaintext-Attack if I use a different IV for every message. Right?
I need to know the used IV to decrypt a message. Also right?
AES that isn't protected against Known-Plaintext-Attack is a weak encryption. Right?
This means I have to store every IV with the encrypted data (e.g. in a extra DB column). Sounds like a lot of overhead.
Is there any solution to this problem?
","For a 128 bit message, a 96 bit IV (for AES in GCM mode as per NIST recommendation) might look like a big overhead. But usually the plain text messages to be encrypted are much larger than that. Much larger as compared to the fixed size 96 bit IV. 
On the other hand, almost every safe encryption or hashing mechanisms need a kind of randomness in the form of IV, nonce, salt etc. Not just AES.
It's an overhead but that is a tradeoff for security.
Usually IV is appended or prepended with the ciphertext. And decryption logic knows where to find it in the cipher text.
Overhead is everywhere. For e.g. in an RDBMS table when we create an index, it's an overhead in terms of space and write processing time. But it's a tradeoff for fast query performance.

If recp is NULL, symmetric rather than public key encryption is
  performed. Symmetrically encrypted cipher text can be deciphered with
  gpgme_op_decrypt. Note that in this case the crypto backend needs to
  retrieve a passphrase from the user. Symmetric encryption is currently
  only supported for the OpenPGP crypto backend.

But where does the key used for the symmetric encryption come from? Is it somehow possible to fetch this key and transfer it to another device (where I would like to decrypt the text) ?
","The session key for symmetric encryption is derived from a passphrase, which will be queried from the user through one of the pinentry methods. Specifically highlighting a part of the text you already quoted:

I'm not aware you can extract the session key through GPGME, but you don't really need to: all you need to know at the other end is the passphrase used, and the session key can be derived again. You could of course also reimplement the string-to-key-function used for OpenPGP.

If someone could give me some advice that would be great!
","Ok the two methods taken together, I see two problems wrong with the code:

oneTimePad assumes that the input is uppercase.  The plaintext is lower case.  I think there could be a mismatch there.
ASCII 90 is 'Z'.  I think you might mean 97 which is 'a'.  I recommend you replace the numbers with their characters anyway ... instead of 65 use 'A'.

Can anyone advise what might be going wrong here or how I can correctly do this in PHP?
","In your $sql there is a SELECT statement, so you most likely need to fetch the result after executing the statement:
$result = $db->execute($sql);
while ($row = $result->fetchRow()) {
  print_r($result);
}

See ADOdb documentation for more details.
P.S. The double quotes in your execute() call simply do nothing, you may omit them.

"36282444","tokenization engine | encryption-decryption using seed file","I need to build web server (window server) with a tokenization engine for encrypting sensitive data. As per client requirement : 

The server should be configured with a unique encryption/hash ""seed"" file that can be backed up
The server should use the seed file to tokenize (i.e. mask/hash/encrypt) sensitive data fields
The server should pass the tokenized values to the database (MySQL) for save operation.
The server should un-tokenize the data when retrieved from the database for display on the website

My question is 
 - how to create seed file? 
 - if data is encrypted using seed file and then somebody change/update seed file. In this case can we able to decrypt data
Please advise approach to meet above requirement.
","One can create a ""seed"" with a cryptographic PRNG (Pseudo Random Number Generator) or a HRNG (Hardware Random Number Generator). Most computer systems contain a cryptographic PRNG and HRNGs with a limited entropy rate can be purchased cheaply in USB configurations.
Save the generated seed in a secure (possibly bank) safe on paper and/or a USB drive for restoration.
On the high security end use a HSM (Hardware Security Module).
The server needs to be secure including good two factor authentication.
This seems to answer the final question statement but entire question is unclear. If you are dealing with CC payments you will need to become familiar with PCI (Payment Card Industry).

","In your AesCrypt::CreateAESProviderAlgo method above, insure that SYMM_KEY_SIZE_SECRET is 32 and that the associated string is also 32 bytes long.
A copy and paste of your function into my test program worked for me when SYMM_KEY_SIZE_SECRET was specified as 32.  It didn't work when I specified a SYMM_KEY_SIZE_SECRET value of 16.
In addition, this algorithm is only supported on Windows 10 and above.
Further info:
XTS is a 2 key variant of AES.  It also requires a Message Block Size (sector size) and a Sector Number.
I used BCryptGenerateSymmetricKey to build the key.  I took an input 'string' of either 32 bytes (2 16 byte keys) or 64 bytes (2 32 byte keys) to generate the keys from the 'string'.  No other values were accepted.
The Message Block Size is set as the BCRYPT_MESSAGE_BLOCK_LENGTH parameter on the key handle.  It does not have to be an integral multiple of the AES block length - this is the difference between XTS and XEX.
The Sector Number is supplied as the IV value in the Encrypt / Decrypt APIs.  For me, only a length of 8 for the IV was accepted.

I have multiple instances of my server running that would be encrypting and decrypting the texts. I want to understand how can I share the secret key across multiple instances of application so that texts encrypted by one can be decrypted by other.
How can I serialize the key to a file and again generate the key from the file?
-Thanks
","The answer I'm giving is more in the deployment/operational space but could solve your issue. I'm looking at the superclass for reference, which has the encrypt and decrypt implementations containing the key.
You could:

Hand all of the instances of the app a string representing that deployment as an environment variable. (Maybe its the revision number deployed or hashed date or something).
Develop your application to consume and hash this value using an algorithm of your choice at startup. This is your key that's made available as a singleton to your code which encrypts/decrypts messages.
Ensure your deployment mechanism (whether its you manually, or some code) gives all of the instances the same value. (i.e. choose something consistent to the deployment or code deployed)

This approach ensures that the actual key is obfuscated by your code (it won't be the ENV variable ver-batim) and that you can rotate it often to keep it secure.
Hope thats what you were looking for.

"43194179","Symmetric encryption - is it insecure to use one symmetric key to encrypt another or do I need to use asymmetric keys","I'm trying to add a hybrid encryption scheme to my PHP application, and by ""hybrid"" I mean that each record in the database is encrypted by its own unique symmetric key and each symmetric key is encrypted by a shared private key not stored in the database. The symmetric keys are 256 bit AES keys and the private key is a 2048 bit RSA key.
The hybrid encryption scheme works but decrypting the symmetric keys is introducing a bottleneck into the application - decrypting one key is fine, but if I need to retrieve 100 records from the database and decrypt a field in them the script execution time is becoming a real issue because of the overhead decrypting the symmetric key adds. My unscientific tests using the speed tool in OpenSSL suggest that going from a 1024 bit RSA key to a 2048 RSA key is resulting in a decryption time seven times longer on my machine.
Is there a good reason why I can't just use a shared symmetric key (stored securely) to encrypt the symmetric keys for each record? I'm not entirely clear on what the benefit of using an asymmetric key scheme is. I understand that the RSA key can't be used to encrypt large amounts of data (which is why I'm using a symmetric key to do that) but is it the case that a symmetric key shouldn't be used to protect a small amount of data i.e. a 256 bit AES key?
Thanks in advance for any help or guidance!
","The irony of your question is that the use of a 2048-bit RSA key to encrypt a 256-bit AES key actually degrades the security -- see Table 1 (the difficulty to break an 88-bit symmetric key is about the same as the difficulty to break a 2054-bit RSA key)!
The benefit of public key cryptography for an application like this is when the decryption happens in an isolated place than the encryption.  However, if they are both happening in the same place, then you are only making things worse by bringing in RSA.  Instead, just stick with the AES.

Provided we share an initial OTP, possibly via USB or some other physically secure method, surely we can include the next one in the messages that follow.
[Edit: More specifically, if I were to take a pad of double length, splitting it into x and y. Then using x to encrypt the message, and using y twice to encrypt the next pad, would that be insecure?]
","You have to pair each bit of message with a same size bit of OTP. There's a limited amount of OTP. 
If you pair up all of the OTP bits with bits for the next OTP...
a b c d e ...
q w e r t ...

There's no room for a message. And if you keep spending your OTP transferring another OTP, there never will be room for a message.
You can't compress the OTP, because the strength of the OTP is that it's completely random - that's what makes it impossible for codebreakers, because there's no pattern to latch onto.
Compression is a technology that works by finding patterns and replacing them with shorter ""that large repetitive block goes here and here and there"" signals - and by definition there are no patterns in complete randomness, so OTPs are not compressible.
If you can compress it a bit, you could do this but it's not right to describe it as OTP anymore, it's weak - and also massively wasteful of bandwidth. If you can compress it a lot, throw your random number generator away it's terrible.

Quick test demonstration of concept on a linux machine:
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/test count=10k
    -> 5Mb file of randomness

$ bzip2 /tmp/test 
    -> 5.1Mb file
$ gzip /tmp/test
    -> 5.1Mb file

Compressing a pad makes it bigger, by adding all the bzip/gzip file format information and doing nothing else.

","What makes a One-Time Pad strong is, in addition to the lack of a pattern, the fact that there is no way to tell that the key used was the correct key. A message could be decrypted to reveal some ""take over the world"" scenario, but literally every message encrypted with a key of that exact length has a key that reveals that exact same message, word for word. This means you could have the actual decrypted message and the correct key, but it would be impossible to know that this is the case, and because literally any message (and I do mean literally) of that length can be a result. Even rubber-hose-decryption won't work. Even if the person being ""persuaded"" gives the correct key, there's no way to be sure. It's even common practice for people to possess fake keys that decrypt messages to reveal a message that isn't what an investigator is looking for, but would definitely be something even a completely innocent person would hide. A OTP hiding confidential information could, for instance, have a fake key that reveals someone bad-mouthing their commanding officer.

","You can't use FileInputStream to read a file which you are currently writing.  It's not built to read an in-progress file.
It looks like you are trying to write the encrypted stream to dos (you don't include it's definition in the server code).  If so, you should be using that as the underlying stream for the CipherOutputStream.
Likewise, in the client, you try the same thing.  If you want to write the file to disk first, then write the entire file to disk, then decrypt.  if you want to stream decrypt, then wrap the CipherInputStream around the socket InputStream (presumably dis?).
Additionally, you don't show where you get len from on the client, but i'm assuming it is the length of the original data?  if so, then your progress computation is incorrect because the length of the encrypted data will usually be different from the length of the original data.

Moreover, some other media files like (mp4, mkv etc) are stuck at 99% and doesn't go beyond that, although they r fully received (just some minor bytes difference but Size on Disk always matches).
I just want some help to get rid of these both problems. The files r transfering from 1 PC to another via socket programming.

Any input is highly appreciated. Thank You.
Edit 1: Added the link to the sizes of encrypted and decrypted file received via stream. Dropbox Link
Edit 2: So finally the problem is solved with the help of three members who participated in helping me to the fullest. I was reviewing other solutions to my problem and I encounter with this solution which helped me to think deep bout the actual scenario happening in the background. Thanks to Artjom B. for his referral solution and @zaph & @jtahlborn for clearing my false assumptions bout padding and Input/Output streams.
","When using padding, PKCS#5 or PKCS#7, the encrypted output will be larger, up to and including one block size. See PKCS#7. The padding is removed after decryption.
The encrypted data will be longer so that must be accounted for. How depends on how the output is being handled. If it is going to a pre-allocated area such as a memory buffer the buffer must be allocated one block-size (16-bytes for AES) larger. If streaming usually just make sure all encrypted bytes are sent, n=it just the length of the input. All of this is per-implementation and system/language dependent. 
The padding bytes are dynamically created by the encryption method so the input does not need to be altered. This assumes that the encryption method is adding the padding and the decryption method is removing the padding.
Example 1: If you have 1024-bytes of data the encrypted output will be 1040-bytes. On decryption the input data will be 1040-bytes and the output decrypted data will be 1024-bytes.
Example 2: If you have 1020-bytes of data the encrypted output will be 1024-bytes. On decryption the input data will be 1024-bytes and the output decrypted data will be 1020-bytes.

","Do not ever treat encrypted data as a String. It is binary data and almost certainly something bad is happening when you call outputBytes.toString().
If you must treat the binary data as a string, you should apply a transformation that can deal with binary data and reliably produces a usable string. An example would be base64 encoding.
In your question, you seem to be expecting that the unencrypted text to be the same length as the encrypted bytes converted to a string. There is no reason why this would be true.
You should expect that if you encrypt and then decrypt the encrypted bytes that you get back your original message. However, the size of the encrypted data will almost certainly NOT be the same size.

","If you can store key in CMOS RAM, why hacker can not read from it? Reading from CMOS is much more simple than writing to it. 
It is theoretically possible to store your data into CMOS, but it will be vendor (or even model) dependent. Different BIOSes uses CMOS RAM differently and you can't know what part of RAM is free for usage.
Much better will be use SMART card. They can guarantee that key saved into it never will left card (all cryptography is done inside SMART card). So you once save key into card and then only say 'decrypt (or encrypt) this buffer for me'.
UPD:
There was a long discussion in comments. Summarizing, there are next ways to protect keys:

Use external secured cryptography module. For example: smart card, HSM. 
Prevent physical access for unauthorized personnel. For example: safe, locking case, alarm on opening case, etc.
Demand (administratively or programmatically) that access to a device is only can be done by group of personnel, not individuals. For example: two security officers know only his own part of password to access a device.  
Built system based on a Chain of Trust. 
Use TPM (Trusted platform module).

Hello, I have searched SO for how to convert or get the String representation of a public key or private key, most of the answers were very old and only for how to convert  String pubKey =""...."";  into a key.
I tried to generate the keys and get the encoded bytes and I tried to convert the byte to String as my code shows above, but I am not sure if I am doing it in the right way by simply converting the encoded bytes into a String.
","
The Private/Public Key bytes:
byte[] theBytes = key.getEncoded();
Using new String(theBytes) is not so good, because it uses the default Charset (based on OS). Better is to pass the Charset you want (e.g UTF-8) a be consistent in that.
I would suggest to have a HEX representation of the Private/Public keys . There are multiple ways to convert a byte[] into HEX string ( Java code To convert byte to Hexadecimal ). Having the HEX format makes also the key easier to read in some UI. E.g: AA BB CC 22 24 C1 ..
Other option is Base64 format e.g:  Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(theBytes). (Java 8)

","Warning: This is Weak Cryptography

You're using CBC mode with a constant IV of null bytes (the IV should be randomly generated for each message).
You're not authenticating your ciphertext.
Naive use of rtrim() exposes your application to padding oracle attacks, which wouldn't be a problem if you were following an Encrypt Then MAC construction.

The Actual Bugs in Your Code
$iv = mcrypt_create_iv(16, '00000000000000000000000000000000'); 

That's not how this function is meant to be used.
string mcrypt_create_iv(int $length, int $source);

For example: mcrypt_create_iv(16, MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM); will generate 16 bytes of random data from /dev/urandom. It looks like you want str_repeat(""\0"", 16) here, but as I said above, this is a horrible idea.
You also didn't base64_decode() the key.

I really hope you aren't deploying this code anywhere.
Recommended reading: Write crypto code! Don't publish it! by Talyor Hornby.
Also, if you can avoid using mcrypt, you'll find yourself a lot happier.

The nodejs package indicates that it generates a random IV. That likely means it also encodes the random IV in the output and expects it in the input, and sure enough that's what we see in the code:
ciphertext = Buffer.concat([iv, ciphertext, cipher.final()]);

Assuming that the source code below the PHP page is actually related to the tool, then they've called this:
$this->setIV("""");

which probably translates somewhere into 16 bytes of zeros (which is a very insecure IV).
The shorter answer is that there is absolutely no standard for applying AES or encoding the output. The vast majority of implementations you find (including these two) are very insecure because they assume you know how to add all the pieces they're missing. For example, both of these implementations need an HMAC, since they used CBC mode, but neither includes one, and if you want to hand a string like ""apple"" as the password, you need a key derivation function like PBKDF2 to convert it to a key. (This is how you convert a string like ""apple"" into something ""effectively random."") Any secure implementation will be incompatible with any other secure implementation. There just isn't a widely used standard format that is also secure.
All that said, a secure format should always cause two encryptions to have different resulting cipher texts. The nodejs package does this correctly by including a random IV, and if you ran it multiple times, you would get different results. That's a feature that prevents certain kinds of attacks. So having different results shouldn't be surprising.
If you're looking for an off-the-shelf AES format that includes all the pieces you need, take a look at RNCryptor or libsodium.

"32469648","How many times can AesCryptoServiceProvider.GenerateIV be safely called before exhausting the number of unique IVs?","I am confused. According to the below my IV ""MUST"" be unique for every round of encryption.

Properties of an IV depend on the cryptographic scheme used. A basic
  requirement is uniqueness, which means that no IV may be reused under
  the same key. For block ciphers, repeated IV values devolve the
  encryption scheme into electronic codebook mode: equal IV and equal
  plaintext result in equal ciphertext. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector

I am using the .NET AesCryptoServiceProvider class. I am using GenerateIV to generate a new IV and sending that IV along with the cipher text to a remote endpoint which will then decrypt the packet using the IV and privately shared key.
My packet is XML, and thus will always start with the same leading text. (e.g. ""<SomeTag ...>unique_text</SomeTag>"")
My key might live over thousands of encrypt/decrypt cycles during the five to ten minute life of the key. How many times can I call GenerateIV before I generate the same IV twice? Or phrased another way, how many cycles is GenerateIV good for? Five, ten, hundreds, thousands, millions?
Here is the code in question:
_sessionKeys[_currentSessionKeyId].GenerateIV();
var key = _sessionKeys[_currentSessionKeyId].Key;
var iv = _sessionKeys[_currentSessionKeyId].IV;

ICryptoTransform encryptor = _sessionKeys[_currentSessionKeyId].CreateEncryptor(key,iv);

It seems that given that the IV generated by AesCryptoServiceProvider.GenerateIV is of finite size, then the number of times it can be called before generating a duplicate IV is also finite. But what is that finite number.
","There is 128 bits (16 bytes) in a IV. According to the Wikipeda page on the Birthday Attack (the probability you will see a repeated value pulling randomly from a pool) to have a 0.0000000000000001% chance of seeing any number twice you must call the function about 26,000,000,000 times. To get it to be a 1% chance any number is seen twice you must call it 2,600,000,000,000,000,000 times.
This assumes GenerateIV has a ""good"" random number generator that gives a even distribution, which it should have.

","Please start by reading Thomas Pornin's canonical answer to How to securely hash passwords?.
PBKDF2 options are listed in the question PBKDF2 function in Android, but include a native SecretKeyFactory method as well as Spongycastle, bouncycastle, rtner.de, etc.
Long, cryptographically random per-password salt is required (make room for more than one password for future growth!).
Never ask PBKDF2 for more key length than the native function supports - that 64 bytes for PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-512, and 20 bytes for PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-1.
Always use as high an iteration count as your users can stand.  Even for android devices, for a single user on their own device, done only once at application start, that's in the hundreds of thousands or more for PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-1 and the tens to hundreds of thousands for PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-512.
Note that PBKDF2's primary use is in creating encryption keys - you can use the same password entered to generate the encryption key for files you encrypt using AES (NOT in ECB mode); just use a different salt and a different number of iterations.  If you're only doing that, then you don't even need the password hash; simply try decrypting the file with the key generated and a stored salt and number of iterations - if it works, it was the right password.  If it fails, it wasn't.

","The output type of Cipher#doFinal(byte[]) is byte[], but Arrays don't have a default way in which their contents are printed. By calling byte[].toString() on an array, you're simply printing its type and hash code. (More on this here)
What you want is
decrypted = new String(cipher2.doFinal(decodedBytes), ""UTF-8"");

which tells the String constructor that the given byte array contains characters that are encoded in UTF-8.
When you do that, then you also need to get the byte array out of the string in a specific encoding:
clear.getBytes(""UTF-8"")

If you omit the encoding, then the system default is used which might make your plaintexts unrecoverable when you send the ciphertexts across systems which have different system encoding defaults.
Btw, you don't need both Cipher instances. Only one suffices since you're initiating it always during encryption and decryption.

Other security problems:

Always use a fully qualified cipher string. So change Cipher.getInstance(""AES"") to Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"").
Never use ECB mode which is the default when you use ""AES"" cipher string. It is not semantically secure. Use at least CBC mode with a random IV:
SecureRandom r = new SecureRandom();
byte[] iv = new byte[16];
r.nextBytes(iv);
...
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, skeySpec, new IvParameterSpec(iv));

The IV is not supposed to be secret, so you can simply prepend it to the ciphertext and splice it off before decryption.
Authenticate your ciphertext so that you're not vulnerable to a padding oracle attack and can always check your ciphertexts for integrity. This can be easily done with an encrypt-then-MAC scheme with a strong MAC algorithm like HMAC-SHA256. You can also use an authenticated mode of encryption like GCM or EAX.

I seem to recall a post here (I can't find it again though!) that explained the modern File Systems (i.e newer than FAT32) can cause issues when attempting this kind of delete as they're a journaling file system and recovering data is far easier than in ye olden days. 
After even more reading, I read it would be an idea to:

Generate a new random 256 bit encryption key. 
Encrypt FileB to FileA. 
Repeat this n number of times to suit your level of paranoia. 
Use File.Delete to delete FileA and FileB. 

This seems a logical way for encrypting/re-encrypting the data in the files over and over with keys that will never ever be recoverable or re-usable but is this actually a secure way? Will the file system overwrite the file at the same location/cluster (obviously the file will grow as it's contents are subject to encryption/re-encryption), ensuring the original content is overwritten?
","Your approach won't necessarily solve your problem, and the problem doesn't only exist for journaling filesystems. (The old DOS undelete tool demonstrates that.)
Modern filesystems may move files around at any time, transparently to programs that are currently running, so juggling file content around doesn't guarantee that you won't be leaving an old copy of the file in a section of the disk that's marked unused.
You'd be better off using encryption directly rather than trusting that you can fool the OS into overwriting the old data.

","Encryption algorithms generally produce random (looking) bytes. These bytes can have any value. You can encode this value, for instance using hexadecimals or base 64. With hexadecimals you have already code that only contains 0..9 and a..f (in upper or lower case). However, hexadecimal encoding is not very efficient, doubling the ciphertext.
Base 64 uses 64 characters: A..Z, a..z, 0..9, + and /, and sometimes a padding character =. It is however very easy to replace the URL unsafe + and / characters with other ones, e.g. - and _ according to RFC 4648. You can also remove any = characters at the end, although you may have to put them back (until you get a multiple of 4 base 64 characters) depending on the base 64 decoding routine. Base 64 uses 4 characters for 3 bytes, so it expands the ciphertext by 33%.

Can some one explain me what is the benefit of hashing here ? 
","because in your case AES requires a 128 bit key so to build it up it need 16 bytes. How to get those 16 bytes? The most common way is to hash your user password and grab the first 16 bytes of the hash. Doing this will ensure that the AES algorithm will always receive a proper 16 bytes key.  
Thanks to the hashing algorithm even short passwords such as ""123456"" or ""god"" will be transformed to a fixed length 20 byte hash

"37360481","Web form submission : Client-side encryption and source code not accessible","I'm not really experienced in website and specially website security.
Before the problem, let's explain the context :
I have created a web page that is meant to be a platform with an order form X to be filled by some client A with some critical fields Y to be encrypted. Then, the web server would send a mail with X+Y to the seller B, so he can process the order.
What I did :
I created a form with Spring MVC with a controller (in Java) and an HTML view template. This tutorial helped me a bit : https://spring.io/guides/gs/handling-form-submission/. When A submits X+Y, I encrypt Y (with a symmetric TEA Encryption) in the Controller (So I guess that is obviously server-side) and then send it to the retailer by mail. Then the retailer decrypts it with the same key used for decryption.
The problem :
I would like it to be really secure so I don't want to send Y to the server and then encrypt it, I want to encrypt it on the client side and then send it to the controller.
Is Javascript client-side the only solution to do this ? I would prefer to do it in Java on the client side because what I want is that the encryption is client-side and also the source code containing the encryption algorithm hidden to anyone (which is not the case I guess in HTML and Javascript).
So, for client-side and hidden source code encryption, is it possible to do it with Spring MVC and Java, or with Javascript, or do you have any other suggestion ?
","As indicated, I wouldn't worry about people having access to the encryption code itself, this is the least of your concerns security-wise. There are publicly-available reference implementations and specifications for all common encryption algorithms anyway. A major requirement of modern cryptographic algorithms is that the security lies in the secrecy of the key, not in the secrecy of the algorithm itself. (This was actually an explicit requirement for the Data Encryption Standard and has held for all subsequently-designed algorithms). Relying on the secrecy of the encryption algorithm you're using is a form of security by obscurity, which is a bad practice.
There's a decent discussion of public-key cryptography in JavaScript here:
Are there any asymmetric encryption options for JavaScript?

","Isn't this proposal totally silly?
You should encrypt with RSA public keys not with a private key. If you encrypt with a private key as you propose then everyone with access to the public key will learn the AES key and will be able to decrypt or forge anything. Of course for the same reason you should also not use the same AES key for distinct receivers.
And to answer the question, you should use a new random IV for each AES/CBC encryption.

","If I understand what you are trying to do then, like most licensing schemes, it is basically a DRM scheme. I'll only address the cryptography problem, but there is also of course the problem of playing hide-and-seek from the hackers. You should know that no DRM scheme offers any measurable security (unless perhaps security hardware is involved) in the cryptographic sense, but they are still common and some developers are comfortable with the logic behind them.
What you want to do is generate your license data and include some information that prevents a user from simply copying a valid license file from a legitimate user. Examples might be mac address, phone number, etc. Then you sign this data. The license then consists of the unencrypted license and the signature bytes. On the user side, your installation software will verify the signature using the hard-coded public key, and perform any other checks (mac address matches, phone number matches, etc).
This would be the core of your scheme, and is enough for most developers. You can take this core and further obfuscate it using ad-hoc including encryption, splitting, etc., depending on how far you want to go with the hide-and-seek game.
EDIT:   
If I may make a suggestion, I think the book Beginning Cryptography With Java would be a wise investment. It includes examples that using the Bouncycastle library. You can donwload the examples for free from the same website.

","The book ""The Design of Rijndael"" (ISBN 3-540-42580-2) has a great list of test vectors in appendix D for all the intermediate steps of an AES 128 encryption. Step through your code and compare your results with those from the book. It should be easy to change your code temporarily to AES-128 to find the bugs and then switch it back to AES-256 afterwards.
After that, throw away your implementation and use an established implementation that has been thoroughly tested, since yours is vulnerable to timing attacks (because of the if(state[(j * 4) + c] & 0x80)), which allows an attacker to find out the secret key. To avoid this and other implementation bugs, consult a book about implementing cryptography and try to use as much preexisting code as possible instead of writing your own.

Instead, you should deal with this exception at a higher level (outside the cryptography module). For instance, you could have something like this in your UI layer:
try

    var encryptedFilePath = ShowOpenFileDialog();
    var decryptedFilePath = TryDecryptFile(encryptedFilePath);
    ShowMessagePopup(""Your file has been decrypted to: "" + decryptedFilePath);

"18596577","Why is decryption failing after separate writes to this file-like object?","I'm working on a toy module to encrypt tempfiles.  The idea is to expose an interface similar to that found in the tempfile module, but to have data transparently encrypted using session keys.  Again, it's just a toy project and not production code.
First, a few technical details.  This project is implemented with pycrypto and is employing:

AES-CTR
A counter with a 1-bit randomized prefix

The basic class is structured so as to mimic the file object interface.  When a method such as read or write is called, we initialize a Crypto.Cipher.AES object using the class' _cipher property.  This property is implemented as follows:
def _cipher():
    doc = doc = ""Returns a stateful AES object ready to decrypt at the required \
                 stream position""

    def fget(self):
        ctr = Counter.new(nbits=64,
                          initial_value=self.tell()  # alias of self._file.tell
                          prefix=self._nonce)  # set by `Random.new().read(8)
        return AES.new(self._key, counter=ctr, mode=self._opmode)  # self._opmode = Crypto.Cipher.AES.MODE_CTR

    def fset(self, value):
        raise AttributeError('Cannot set _cipher')

    def fdel(self, value):
        raise AttributeError('Cannot delete _cipher')

    return locals()
        _cipher = property(**_cipher())

Here is an example of how the _cipher property is used to encrypt transparently during a call to the write method.
def write(self, data):
    if not isinstance(data, str):
        raise TypeError('Data must be str (or bytestring)')
    self._file.write(self._cipher.encrypt(data))

When decrypting, we apply the opposite transaction as such:
def read(self, size=-1):
    return self._cipher.decrypt(self._file.read(size))

This works when making single calls to write, but fails when multiple calls to write are chained.  For instance:
ep = EphemeralFile()  # the class in question
ep.write('Now is the winter of our discontent')
ep.seek(0)
print ep.read()

>> Now is the winter of our discontent

So far so good... but here's where it fails
ep.write(' made glorious summer by this sun of York')
ep.seek(0)
print ep.read()

>> Now is the winter of our discontent""d_""��U�L~ �w���S��h��]""U(��P^��9k

What am I doing wrong?  Shouldn't the use of self._file.tell() in the _cipher property yield the appropriate counter position for decryption?
Please note that I first suspected that I might be off by one counter tick, so I tried modifying the initial_value=self.tell() line to initial_value=self.tell() + 1 (also tried with -1), but to no avail.

","I believe one problem is that the Counter object should receive as initial_value the AES block number, not the byte offset. In other words, you need to have:
ctr = Counter.new(nbits=64,
                  initial_value=self.tell() % 16,
                  prefix=self._nonce)

That's needed because in AES CTR mode you increase the value each time you cross the AES data boundary (16 bytes).
That also means that the correct sequence for any write operation roughly is:

Start the cipher object as shown above - in encryption mode.
Encrypt self.tell() % 16 bytes of any data and throw away the result.
Encrypt the input data and write it to the file.

Similarly for reading:

Start the cipher object as shown above - in decryption mode.
Decrypt self.tell() % 16 bytes of any data and throw away the result.
Decrypt the data read from the file.

From a quick look at the code, a second problem could also be that you use the same AES object for both encryption and decryption. You need two separate objects, one for each direction.

Reading lots of other SO questions on the padding topic I have found that a popular way to do this is by filling each of the remaining places in the state with the number of places left. For example if I only had 12 bytes to encrypt, I would pad the remaining 4 bytes with 4. My question is when decrypting if I have a block which is full but ends in a 1, how do I know if this is one byte of padding or just the value 1?
DISCLAIMER: I know this program should never be used in production as it probably has all sorts of different insecurities. I am doing this for fun, not to encrypt top secret documents.
","What you're describing is the PKCS#7 padding.
In order to disambiguate, you always need to have padding. Additionally, the plaintext for modes like ECB or CBC mode needs to be a multiple of the block size.
Both constraints put together lead to a simple solution: you always add padding up to the next multiple of the block size. If the plaintext is already a multiple of the block size, then you add a full block of padding where each byte represents 16 (for AES).

","It depends on which implementation of System.Security.Cryptography.SymmetricAlgorithm you're using. The legal key and block sizes are dependent upon the algorith. You can check the LegalKeySizes and LegalBlockSizes property to check what sizes are supported by your particular algorithm. You can also use the ValidKeySize() method to check if a particular key size is valid for your algorithm.
IIRC, the IV needs to be sized the same size as the block size in use.
Also, normally, you'd gen up an instance of your particular algorithm and let it create a random key and IV, which you can then save for later use.

"47371980","AWS Encryption SDK Header Mismatch between Regions","I'm using the Amazon Encryption SDK to encrypt data before storing it in a database. I'm also using Amazon KMS. As part of the encryption process, the SDK stores the Key Provider ID of the data key used to encrypt in the generated cipher-text header. 
As described in the documentation here http://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/message-format.html#header-structure

The encryption operations in the AWS Encryption SDK return a single
  data structure or message that contains the encrypted data
  (ciphertext) and all encrypted data keys. To understand this data
  structure, or to build libraries that read and write it, you need to
  understand the message format.
The message format consists of at least two parts: a header and a
  body. In some cases, the message format consists of a third part, a
  footer.

The Key Provider ID value contains the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS KMS customer master key (CMK).
Here is where the issue comes in. Right now I have two different KMS regions available for encryption. Each Key Provider ID has the exact same Encrypted Data Key value. So either key could be used to decrypt the data. However, the issue is with the ciphertext headers. Let's say I have KMS1 and KMS2. If I encrypt the data with the key provided by KMS1, then the Key Provider ID will be stored in the ciphertext header. If I attempt to decrypt the data with KMS2, even though the Encrypted Data Key is the same, the decryption will fail because the header does not contain the Key Provider for KMS2. It has the Key Provider ID for KMS1. It fails with this error: 
com.amazonaws.encryptionsdk.exception.BadCiphertextException: Header integrity check failed.
        at com.amazonaws.encryptionsdk.internal.DecryptionHandler.verifyHeaderIntegrity(DecryptionHandler.java:312) ~[application.jar:na]
        at com.amazonaws.encryptionsdk.internal.DecryptionHandler.readHeaderFields(DecryptionHandler.java:389) ~[application.jar:na]
 ...
com.amazonaws.encryptionsdk.internal.DecryptionHandler.verifyHeaderIntegrity(DecryptionHandler.java:310) ~[application.jar:na]
        ... 16 common frames omitted
Caused by: javax.crypto.AEADBadTagException: Tag mismatch!

It fails to verify the header integrity and fails. This is not good, because I was planning to have multiple KMS's in case of one region KMS failing. We duplicate our data across all our regions, and we thought that we could use any KMS from the regions to decrypt as long as the encrypted data keys match. However, it looks like I'm locked into using only the original KMS that was encrypting the data? How on earth can we scale this to multiple regions if we can only rely on a single KMS? 
I could include all the region master keys in the call to encrypt the data. That way, the headers would always match, although it would not reflect which KMS it's actually using. However, that's also not scalable, since we could add/remove regions in the future, and that would cause issues with all the data that's already encrypted.  
Am I missing something? I've thought about this, and I want to solve this problem without crippling any integrity checks provided by the SDK/Encryption.
Update: 
Based on a comment from @jarmod
Using an alias doesn't work either because we can only associate an alias to a key in the region, and it stores the resolved name of the key ARN it's pointing to anyway. 
I'm reading this document and it says 

Additionally, envelope encryption can help to design your application
  for disaster recovery. You can move your encrypted data as-is between
  Regions and only have to reencrypt the data keys with the
  Region-specific CMKs

However, that's not accurate at all, because the encryption SDK will fail to decrypt on a different region because the Key Provider ID of the re-encrypted data keys will be totally different! 
","Apologies since I'm not familiar with Java programming, but I believe there is confusion how you are using the KMS CMKs to encrypt (or decrypt) the data using keys from more than one-region for DR.
When you use multiple master keys to encrypt plaintext, any one of the master keys can be used to decrypt the plaintext. Note that, only one master key (let's say MKey1) generates the plaintext data key which is used to encrypt the data. This plaintext data key is then encrypted by the other master key (MKey2) as well.
As a result, you will have encrypted data + encrypted data key (using MKey1) + encrypted data key (using MKey2).
If for some reason MKey1 is unavailable and you want to decrypt the ciphertext, SDK can be used to decrypt the encrypted data key using MKey2, which can decrypt the ciphertext.
So, yes, you have to specify multiple KMS CMK ARN in your program if you want to use multiple KMS. The document shared by you has an example as well which I'm sure you are aware of.

There is a method SecKeyGenerateSymmetric() in SecKey.h but its for macOS only. The only thing I see available is SecKeyGeneratePair() which is for asymmetric encryption.
Also from reading this documentation it looks the only way to do symmetric encryption is by generating an asymmetric key pair and calling SecKeyCreateEncryptedData() with the public key and behind the scenes a symmetric key is generated but you don't have access to it. I need to have access to the symmetric key.

UPDATE:
Was advised to explicitly add a random IV to the cipher setup and added/modified the following lines of code to facilitate it:
SecureRandom r = new SecureRandom();
        byte[] ivBytes = new byte[16];
        r.nextBytes(ivBytes);

        SecretKey key = generateKey(context, keyphrase.toCharArray());
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, new IvParameterSpec(ivBytes));

Ended up with the same result. First few bytes of the text file were still corrupted.

But I have some doubts related to it as: I am using AESCryptoServiceProvider Class. In that I am using the method CreateEncryptor(Byte[], Byte[]). But the question I want to ask is, If I encrypt the file using key as well as IV, then I have to share the both with the user Key and IV.
What should I do in such case? I want that I should use only key at the time of encryption and decryption. How can I do that?
I am totally confused about it. Please suggest me some steps over it.

","As far as i know, the IV doesn't need to be secret, so you could store it together with the encrypted data on the server. Just make sure that each IV is random and that you don't reuse them.

"17012295","Encrypting data symmetrically and asymmetrically","As far as I have learned so far, asymmetric encryption is too costly for long data. Additionally, from a technical perspective, it's not even possible to encrypt arbitrarily large portions of data (the size of the data is limited by the size of the key being used).
As far as I know the usual workaround is to create a (random) key, use that key to encrypt the data symmetrically, and then only encrypt this key using an asymmetric algorithm.
Now I have two questions:

Is the approach I described so far correct?
What do I do with the encrypted key? Of course, I store or send the encrypted data somewhere, but what about the key? If I understand it correctly, I need to store this key as well, right?

","You are basically correct.  Create a random key.  Encrypt the key itself with the Public Key of the person at the other end, Bob.  Send Bob the encrypted key, which they will be able to decrypt with their Private Key.  This is the asymmetric encryption part.
You also use your key to encrypt that large amount of data (but not too large).  Now you send Bob the encrypted data.  Bob has the encrypted data and the (decrypted) key and so can use symmetric decryption to extract the data from the cyphertext you sent.
Once you have sent the data and key, you should probably securely destroy the key and not use it again unless you have a good reason to keep it.  Generate a new key the next time you need to send something.  Even if you are sending something to Bob again, use a new key.  Even if you are resending the same data to Bob again, use a new key.  Sending too much data on a single key can allow attacks on your data.

The above code I used somewhere mandates IV which JAVA is not asking for. What is the IV used in JAVA code?
I tried many links which didn't work.
Symmetric Encryption between .NET and Java
Please help
","If your current Java decryption code also does not ask for an IV (and your decryption returns the same data you encrypted) then Cipher.getInstance(""AES"") is returning an object using the ECB block mode.
.NET symmetric algorithms default to the CBC block mode, which requires an IV.
You have a couple of options:

Set aesProvider.Mode = CipherMode.ECB before calling CreateEncryptor.


You probably don't want this, see the penguin at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Common_modes.

Pass aesProvider.IV to the IV parameter of CreateEncryptor.  The IV property will make a cryptographically random value on the first read if it's not set.


You will need to pass this data to the decryption routine, which should then use ""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"", and set the IV however one does that in Java.
One common method of transport is to simply prepend the data to the ciphertext, then just pick off the first 16 bytes at decryption time.
DO NOT use a fixed value for an IV, because it's then almost the same as ECB.

Now, I'd like to exchange the key with public encyption, so I want to load two files for each end: its private and the public of the other one. I've already created them. 
So, adding the following code(at the beginning of main) to server works:
RSA* pRSAPRI = RSA_new();
RSA* pRSAPRI2 = RSA_new();
OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms();
OpenSSL_add_all_ciphers();

FILE*   f2;

//load public key of client
f1 = fopen(""client_public.pem"", ""r"");
if (f1==NULL)
{
  printf(""could not open file \n"");
}
pRSAclientimport = PEM_read_RSAPublicKey(f1, &pRSAPRI, NULL, NULL);
fclose(f1);
 //load private key of server
f2 = fopen(""server_private.pem"", ""r"");
if (f2==NULL)
{
  printf(""could not open file \n"");
}
pRSAserver = PEM_read_RSAPrivateKey(f2, &pRSAPRI2, NULL, ""1234"");
fclose(f2);

However, adding this piece of code to client messes with the program, so that the answer from the server is not correct:
 RSA* pRSAPRI2 = RSA_new();
RSA* pRSAPRI = RSA_new();
OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms();
OpenSSL_add_all_ciphers();
ERR_load_crypto_strings();
RSA*    pRSAclient;
RSA*    pRSAserverimport;

FILE*   f3;
FILE*   f4;
//load public key of server
f3 = fopen(""server_public.pem"", ""r"");
if (f3==NULL)
{
  printf(""could not open file \n"");
}
pRSAserverimport = PEM_read_RSAPublicKey(f3, &pRSAPRI, NULL, NULL);

fclose(f3);
 //load private key of client
f4 = fopen(""client_private.pem"", ""r"");
if (f4==NULL)
{
  printf(""could not open file \n"");
}
pRSAclient = PEM_read_RSAPrivateKey(f4, &pRSAPRI2, NULL, ""1234"");

fclose(f4);

Sorry for the long post, but I have no idea where the problem is. I've tried flushing randomly, which I guess may be the problem, but it didn't work. Any ideas?

… the first version runs as expected, so     AES_Encrypt 
  and  send must be cooperating well.

That a program with undefined behavior runs as expected does not imply that all is well.
Andrew Henle is right, saying

I doubt AES_Encrypt() produces a NUL-terminated string as
  its encrypted message, so this line would be wrong:  if( send(sock , enc_message , strlen(enc_message) , 0) < 0)

The AES block size is 16 Bytes; enc_message will have been filled with 16 Bytes, any as well as none of which may be '\0', so strlen(enc_message) could yield a too short length to send as well as render the behavior undefined due to the array being accessed beyond the end.

If: a git pre-hook would assure unmounting the folder(umount ~/encrypted_folder/), and echo to command line something like "" the folder containing an encrypted ecrypfs file system was closed"", then git would push the repo to it's remote location including the folder that contains the encrypted filesystem after having assured the folder was unmounted, so the encryption stands. To ""umount"" no password is asked for. No technical complications to regular git functionality to be observed.
What would be the undesirable consequences?
One is evident: version controlling an encrypted file or folder would be irrelevant. That is acceptable.
Second: instead of git being frugal, would every push write the whole of the encrypted folder to the remote, and bloat the remote repository?
Third: would git ""corrupt"" in any way the encrypted folder?
Incentive: copying a folder containing an encrypted ecryptfs filesystem is trivial, tarring also, using rsync or scp is the evident suggestion, excluding that folder from being inside the repo, using "".gitignore"" also ...
but for workflow reasons: git being used for backup, disregarding the versioning of the folder that contains encrypted filesystem, not having to recourse to anything else and keep things user trivial. One single git push to multiple remote locations for now takes care of all desired data backup per user. For workflow reasons, per user, it would be nice to keep it that way.
White paper: one single backup blob, mostly versioned, and being able to have some encrypted data within the repo and it's remote clones. Prohibiting the folder concerned from being ""open"" by the git pre-hook. Everything in one single git operation. Ecryptfs contains within the encrypted part of the data, anything needed to ""open and close"" the data but the passphrase. This would make for high mobility, needing to clone the remote repo to any git-ecryptfs enabled device, in any remote location and have access to the encrypted data.

What is S-Box, and the relationship with AES? How can it be calculated? Is it depends on symmetric key or not? 
How will cypher text be generated in AES-CCM 128 bit?
","The S-Boxes are a system that is used in symmetric cryptographic algorithms to substitute and obscure the relationship between the key and the text that you want to cypher.
You can see more in this article. Here, you have a part:

There are different types of cyphers according to their design  [68]. One of these is the ​Substitution–PermutationNetwork (SPN) that generates the ciphered text by applying substitution and permutation rounds to the original text and the symmetric key to create confusion. To do this, it must be used the Substitution boxes (S-boxes) and Permutation boxes (P-boxes). The S-boxes substitute one-to-one the bits of a block of the input text in the round with bits of the output text. This output is taken as an input in the P-boxes and then it permutes all the bits that will be used as S-box input in the next round.

How will cypher text be generated in AES-CCM 128 bit?
","As @CGG said, S-boxes are a component of a Substitution-Permutation Network. The Wikipedia entry has good diagrams which will help explain how they work. 
Think of an S-box as a simple substitution cipher -- A=1, B=2, etc. In an SPN, you run input through an S-box to substitute new values, then you run that result through a P-box (permutation) to distribute the modified bits out to as many S-boxes as possible. This loop repeats to spread the changes throughout the entire cipher text. 
In general, an S-box replaces the input bits with an identical number of output bits. This exchange should be 1:1 to provide invertibility (i.e. you must be able to reverse the operation in order to decrypt), should employ the avalanche effect (so changing 1 bit of input changes about half the output bits), and should depend on every bit of input.

I noticed some image files for a game I want to do texture mods for is backed with an encryption and I need a little help.

However, that friend has been busy lately and I haven't been able to get a reply so I don't know much more on the encryption at the moment.
However, I do have the decrypted file, the encrypted version of the same one, and what she claims to be the key. Please help me use the key to decrypt and encrypt said files.
Here's what she says is the password/key... What I know is that it can both decrypt and encrypt the file to my understanding.

Here is the decrypted version of the file.
And the encrypted file is here...
I posted this here instead of the gaming version of Stack Overflow as it's considered off-topic, telling me that I should post this question here. Also, sorry if this question could already be answered in another thread, but I wasn't about to search throuh 27,000 threads for a solution, that could have taken WAY TOO long. Also, this could be considered to belong in Game Development, but since this is such a standard encryption format I thought it'd run along better here than there and I'd probably be shooed off to here, anyways.
Thanks for the help in advance.
","The ""encrypted"" data is just the plain data binary XOR'd with the ""key"".
This is not ""standard encryption"" though. AES/Rijndael for example would be a much better choice for symmetric encryption.

","Yes, it defeats the purpose of the IV. The IV is used so if you encrypt the same message with the same key you don't get the same ciphertext. You might as well just use a constant value of 0, it adds the same amount of security.

","In your case here you are using the same value for your 

Key
IV

Conceptually this is a bad idea because the IV is supposed to be non-secret, and different for each encryption. You've solved the ""different for each encryption"", but you have it identical to your key.
The thing you're trying to defend against is making sure that two encryptions with the same key will not give the same ciphertext. In your case, this will only happen if the RNG generates two identical 128-bit AES keys. 
While the odds of this are low, you should just not have it.

","OK, as long as you use a new, randomly created salt for each message, you are close to what I might do.  The random salt means the IV will change with each new message, and this means that the exact same message will be different crypto-text each transmission.  All good.  The one thing I would change if I were you is instead of using DeriveBytes to get the key and then to get the IV, I would have DeriveBytes give a set of bytes the size of the key and IV together, then split them and use them separately.  The IV should not have to be secret from anyone.  The key must be.  So if you DeriveBytes once from the same salt and password, then split those bytes into key and IV, the attacker is still no closer to knowing the key after looking at the IV than he was before.
Alternatively, you could use a nonce to create a known permutation between the IV bytes and the key bytes.  For example, excuse my pseudocode:
IV = DeriveBytes(salt + password + ""IV"")
key = DeriveBytes(salt + password + ""key"")

Either way is secure.  But I would just DeriveBytes on, say, 32 bytes and then use 16 of them for the IV and 16 of them for the key.  There is no information in the first 16 bytes that will help an attacker calculate the next 16 bytes.

","It looks like one terminal is able to print out the Unicode character that is mentioned and the other doesn't; it replaces it by a square which is usually used for unknown Unicode characters.
It's likely that the binary output is exactly the same. Instead of printing out the values directly you should be comparing them using a binary compare method or by printing them out in hexadecimals or base 64.

","Error -4310 is kCCKeySizeError (see CommonCryptoError.h). That means your key is not the right size.
Looking at this code, this in particular is very suspicious:
getSecretkey()?.data(using: .utf8)

If a key is decodable as UTF-8, it's not a proper key. You seem to have the same problem with your IV. I suspect that generateRandomBytes() does not quite do what it says it does. It's also not going to be possible to decrypt this data because you throw away the random IV (which the decryptor will require). You create room for it in the output (which is good), but you never write it.

"51562266","Is my symmetric encryption algorithm safe?","I recently decided to write my own symmetric encryption program (which could be used in a custom password manager for example). 
I would like your opinion about him, did I make big mistakes? else would it be easily breakable?
It is basically a Vigenere fork trying to get closer to the principles of Vernam encryption but remaining easy to use (you can use any key in order to encrypt your text).
How does it work?

You enter a message (e.g. hello world) and a seed (e.g. seed).
The seed is transformed into a number thanks to a hash function
We add the number of letters of the message to this number, and we hash it another time
A pseudo-random number generator is initialized with the result and a list of random numbers of the text size is generated (it's the key).
We shift each letter with the corresponding number in the list (the first letter of the message is shifted with the first number of our generated list)

Example :
Alphabet: [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z]
List : [1,18,3,17,0]
Word: ""hello""
h+1 = j
e+18 = w
l+3 = o
l+17=c  (as the alphabet is finished, we continue at the beginning)
o+0=o
Output: ""jwoco""


The principles of Vernam encryption specifies that :

the key used to offset the letters must be at least as large as the text size -> It's okay
The key must only be used once -> It's okay if you change your seed or the size of the message (since we include the text size in the hash used to initialize the key)
The key must be completely random -> This will depend on the random number generation algorithm and the hash algorithm but if they are good we should have an output with which it is impossible without the key to find a text that is more likely than another to be the original message.

Is my explanation clear? Do you agree with me? Do you have any clarifications to add? improvements to propose or algorithms of random number generation and hash to advise me?
have a nice day,
Thomas! 
","A relevant anecdote from Bruce Schneier:
See https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/1998/1015.html#cipherdesign

A cryptographer friend tells the story of an amateur who kept
  bothering him with the cipher he invented. The cryptographer would
  break the cipher, the amateur would make a change to ""fix"" it, and the
  cryptographer would break it again. This exchange went on a few times
  until the cryptographer became fed up. When the amateur visited him to
  hear what the cryptographer thought, the cryptographer put three
  envelopes face down on the table. ""In each of these envelopes is an
  attack against your cipher. Take one and read it. Don't come back
  until you've discovered the other two attacks."" The amateur was never
  heard from again.

Use AES.

It's as if it is a savings account which gets bigger, cumulatively daily.. but in this sense we're saying the answer is being generated cumulatively and the key is always present.
I have taken a string of chars
pseudo code:
char H[10] = { ""ABCDEFGHI"", ""\0"" };

and I used 9 32-bit numeric keys to hash them in XOR encryption.
I did it like this:
for (i;i<10;i++)
    bitset<32> K ^= H[i] ^ NUMKEY[i];

Now this makes it impervious without the calculus plotting I did (see what I did there?) So K is an accumulation of calculus points, which are completely predictable according to calculus.
as far as I know, to undo it, I do
for (i;i<10;i++) {
    X=0;
    X ^= K ^ NUMKEY[i];
}

Is there other math involved? I think I have to take that X and do a little K - X to find the true derivative.
Here's the current routine I have for it. But I'm not getting what I'm looking for.

Random code creation introduces uncertainty regarding how many queries it will take to find a code that doesn't collide with a previously created code. So, now it basically comes down to creating codes that are guaranteed to never repeat and that means creating them sequentially.  The problem with a sequential method is the codes are easy to guess.  
Yes, I could have a non-Salesforce datastore that could act as the source of record and go with a random method and do the collision check there, but I'd like to see if the worldwide community has any ideas that might work.  I have tried to find a weak symmetrical encryption algorithm that can yield 8 character ciphers, but I've had no luck so far.
","I would chose an approach like using some random number generator to create a non -repeatable sequence like the one suggested here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/196164/2331592
You have to chose a generator that supports up to [number of possible coupons] combinations. 
Each time you draw a random number then you got another number that is the index of a possible coupon (--> permutation) that can be directly translated into a coupon (but since your coupons digits have different bases it is not so easy as changing numbers base)
example:
if your code pattern looks like a1a 
there a stands for [abcde] and 1 for [123].
this would make 75 permutations.
00 a1a    15 b1a     30 c1a     45 d1a     60 e1a
01 a1b    16 b1b     31 c1b     46 d1b     61 e1b
02 a1c    17 b1c     32 c1c     47 d1c     62 e1c

chosing a simple LCG based on
x = (a*x + c) mod m
setting
x = 1  (any number can be used)
a = 5  (any large number can be used - just make sure that your arithmetic does not overflow)
c = 0
m = 73 
Setting m to be the next smallest prime to your permutation count to make sure that the generator always creates a valid number although that excludes a number of valid combinations at the end - so this generator will never generates the #73 and #74 and also never the #0 since then always 0 is created 
this is the generator output until it loops again:

Each time we get a different index. from that index we can look up in the above table the code, but we also can calculate it:
The digits in our code have different values (as in out decimal digit system, where each digit has a value ten times higher than the previous digit)
a positions have 5 possibilities and 1 has 3 possibilies.
             a3,     a2,    a1
possibilies:  5       3     5
digit value: a3*3*5  a2*5   a1*1
digit value: a3*15   a2*5   a1*1

each of the possibilities has an attached value:

letters  a b c d e
value    0 1 2 3 4

numbers  1 2 3
value    0 1 2  <-- this is a bit counter intuitive - but we need to start at 0

e3b -->      e≙4     3≙2   b≙1
             4*3*5 + 2*5   + 1*1
          =  60    + 10    + 1
          =  71
code e3b --> #71

the other way around to get the code from an index without requiring a look up table.
Each digit can be calvulated by dividing (integer devision) the value by the digits value and take the modulo of the number of possibilites for this digit
#51
    a1 = (51 /  1) mod 5 = 1 ≙ b    
    a2 = (51 /  5) mod 3 = 1 ≙ 2
    a3 = (51 / 15) mod 5 = 3 ≙ d

#51 --> code d2b

As a general hint:
i would decouple the representation of the codes from the internal number.
The number in the example would be the permutation-index.
You only need to know the last issued index, to generate the next one.
How the Index is represented is may be independent from this. in our case the a1a representation.

"52910940","Weird Laravel Encryption EncryptString error","I've been running into a really weird error with the Laravel EncryptString function, curious if anyone has any idea whats wrong.
Basically, I'm encrypting emails in PHP using Laravel, and then later decrypting it with both Laravel and Python. The Laravel code seems to work fine, and the Python code works fine for 99% of my test cases, BUT it glitches out whenever I use my own domain name in the email I'm encrypting.
My Code:
public function encryptEmail(Request $request) {
    if (!Auth::check() && !Auth::viaRemember()) {
            return redirect()->to('/login');
    }
    $this->validate($request, [
                'email' => 'bail|required|email',
    ]);
    $emailToEncrypt = $request->request->get('email');
    $encryptedEmail = Crypt::encryptString($emailToEncrypt);
    $email = Emails::where('accountId', Auth::id())->first();
    $email->val = $encryptedEmail;
    $email->save();

The Problem:
Everything works fine when I'm encrypting emails NOT from my own domain the webserver is running on.
Example:
 string in form           decrypt PHP          decrypt Python
'test@gmail.com' =>     'test@gmail.com',    'test@gmail.com'
'myEmail@icloud.com' => 'myEmail@icloud.com' 'myEmail@icloud.com'
'other@hotmail.com' =>  'other@hotmail.com'  'other@hotmail.com'
'me@mydomain.com' =>    'me@mydomain.com'    'me@my'

As you can see, it seems like once it gets to my domain, it seems like the string encryption gets cut off, I've checked that the entire string is passed into EncryptString so really not sure what would make the Python code glitch out on emails with our domain.
Anyone have any ideas?
EDIT:
Python Code where enc is the encrypted Laravel data
def decrypt(enc):
    key = base64.b64decode(""MyKey="")
    dataDict = json.loads(base64.b64decode(enc))

    decrypter = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, base64.b64decode(dataDict['iv']))
    data = decrypter.decrypt(base64.b64decode(dataDict['value']))

I can push you in the right direction. From a quick google search I found this. It is a sample implementation of RC4 using their own implementation of the cipher.

Normally, the browser (any browser) would start streaming the video file in it's built-in player, but since the data is encrypted, it doesn't know how to handle it.
The way the encryption is done is kind of like HTTPS. The server sends the front end a public key, the front end generates a symmetrical key with the public key and both the server and front end use it to encrypt/decrypt stuff.
I know that if I was using HTTPS, it would work, as an automatic process would occur between the server and browser. So I guess my question is how do I get the browser to display an encrypted video without using HTTPS?
","You must either use a video player that natively knows how to decrypt that format (contact the vendor of the back end), or put a piece of middleware in to decrypt the format (contact the vendor of the back end).  In both cases, you'll need the key as well.
Or log into the back end to change its settings (guess who you should contact).
Alternately, read the manual for the back end.

Let's say that I am sure one of the combination is correct plain text. In the example I know that there are 4! possible plaintext but I have to calculate it in python, because in my real problem n is 10.
I am asking for a piece of code or algorithm
","you need to do letter frequency analysis. read this article about it https://inventwithpython.com/hacking/chapter20.html
there  is source there for frequency analysis in python
once you implement the source code from that tutorial you can then write
def test_solution(cypher,plaintext,encrypted_text):
    tab = string.transtab(cypher,plaintext)
    decrypted = encrypted_text.translate(tab)
    return (englishFreqMatchScore(decrypted),plaintext, decrypted)

tests = [test_solution(cypher,k,enc_text) for k in itertools.permutations(plain)]
print ""SOLUTION:"",max(tests)

note that this assumes the plaintext will be English ... letter frequency will be different for different languages (I think at least)
unfortunately this problem is np hard i think ... in order to find the best solution you must explore the entire solution space (so as N increases length of plaintext alphabet it gets alot harder...)

Here's the steps using java that might be useful to replicate the functions in PHP.

create a hash using sha1
convert the secretkey(from credentials) to bytes array with utf-8 encoding
padd step 2 with xeroes, truncating or padding with zeros (if necessary) so the copy has the specified length of 24
initialize Secretkey with keybytes from step3 using DESede
create cipher with DESede instance
initialize cipher with mode to encrypt using the key from step4
convert data(username/password) to encrypt to byte array with utf-8 encoding
encrypt step 7 using step 6 cipher
encode step8 in base 64 format
convert step9 to string for final string encrypted message

What I have done so far,
function encrypt($data, $secret)  { 



    $key = sha1(utf8_encode($secret), true); <-- Step 1 & 2
    $iv = utf8_encode(""jvz8bUAx""); <-- Do I use initialise vector on it?

    $key .= substr($key, 0, 8); 

    $method = 'des-ede3-cbc'; //<-- Is this cypher method correct from the above?


    if (strlen($data) % 8) {
        $data = str_pad($data, strlen($data) + 8 - strlen($data) % 8, ""\0"");
    }

    $encrypted = openssl_encrypt($data, $method, $key, OPENSSL_RAW_DATA | OPENSSL_ZERO_PADDING, $iv); //Force zero padding.

    $encrypted = urlencode(base64_encode($encrypted)); // Added the urlencode.....
    return $encrypted;
} 

","In the Java-code, the encryption-algorithm is specified as DESede. This corresponds to DESede/ECB/PKCS5Padding, i.e. the ECB-mode and PKCS5-padding are used. This means for the PHP-code:

des-ede3 must be applied 
all code portions related to an IV must be removed (since the ECB-mode doesn't use an IV)
the custom padding (which is by no means PKCS5-Padding) must be removed (since openssl_encrypt uses PKCS5-padding by default)

In the Java-code, the SHA1-hash (with a size of 20 bytes) is extended to 24 bytes by appending 0-values. This extension must also be done in the PHP-code.
A possible PHP-counterpart to the Java _encrypt-method is:
function encrypt($data, $secret)  {
    $key = sha1(mb_convert_encoding($secret, ""UTF-8""), true);                   // Create SHA-1 hash (20 byte) 
    $key = str_pad($key, 24, ""\0"");                                             // Extend to 24 byte by appending 0-values (would also happen automatically on openssl_encrypt-call)
    $encrypted = openssl_encrypt($data, 'DES-EDE3', $key, OPENSSL_RAW_DATA);    // Encryption: DESede (24 byte key), ECB-mode, PKCS5-Padding
    return base64_encode($encrypted);                                           // Base64-encoding
}

Finally: The Java-code has a number of disadvantages, e.g.

Triple-DES is used. A better choice would be AES, see e.g. here
the ECB-mode is used, which is unsafe per se, see e.g. here. A better choice would be CBC or GCM (the latter under AES). 
SHA-1 is used as KDF (which gives a too short key, 20 bytes instead of the 24 bytes actually needed). A better choice would be PBKDF2.

The latter just for the sake of completeness, as it's probably legacy code that can't be changed for any reason.

Part 1
Is there a significant increased risk in using the string that I need to encrypt as the key? A public available (same row) salt is added to the key, if that matters.
Part 2
The same question, but applied to the following scenario:  

A is encrypted with B as the key (including salt) and
B is encrypted with A as the key (including salt).

Both encrypted values are stored in the same database row.
","Part 1
As long as your string password is long enough and your function to convert the string into a key is robust, then there are no special security concerns attached to using a string password this way.
Part 2
To prevent against replay attacks involving the first block, you should always salt. Either inject a nonce into the IV, or inject at the head of the stream being encrypted.

I use password to decrypt this storage. However, password is strong and I change it every N months. What I want to do is to create another key (LUKS allows it) for my storage and store it somewhere in my USB drives box (about a hundred of them don't ask me why) as a backup plan if I forget password or would need to let someone open storage without telling the actual password.
My first easiest solution was to create something like this: first partition is vfat using 99% of space. And last partition of 1% size will hold only key file. I'll even be able to write a script somehow like ""Plug in recovery key"" which would look for FS ID. This wouldn't be suspicious for Windows users, but I tho I could do it better. So now the question is: how to perform it better (better security-wise)? My best thought was to write 512 bits key between partitions or just after one big partition without creating another partition for key, but the problem is that I'm not sure whether this data could be overwritten or not (it is not in use by FSs so it could be used for something else?). And I don't really know how to access it later (I guess 'dd' can read from exact block for exact length). Thank you for any answer.

"54410333","Does Windows have AEAD API? (c.f. CryptProtectData, but using a key)","Does Windows provide a high-level, tested, supported, function to perform authenticated encryption using a symmetric key?
Of course AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data) would be better. But this question is only asking AE (Authenticated Encryption).
Background
Windows provides a (relatively) simple API to encrypt a blob using the CryptProtectData API, which we can wrap in an easy to use function:
public Byte[] ProtectBytes(Byte[] plaintext)
{
   //...
}

The details of ProtectBytes are less important than the idea that you can use it quite easily:

here are the bytes I want encrypted by a secret key held in the System
give me back the encrypted blob

The returned blob is an undocumented documentation structure that contains everything needed (i.e. hash algorithm, cipher algorithm, salt, HMAC signature, etc) to decrypt and return the original data .
For completeness, here's the sample pseudocode implementation of ProtectBytes that uses the Crypt API to protect bytes:
public Byte[] ProtectBytes(Byte[] plaintext)
{
   //Setup our n-byte plaintext blob
   DATA_BLOB dataIn;
   dataIn.cbData = plaintext.Length;
   dataIn.pbData = Addr(plaintext[0]);

   DATA_BLOB dataOut;

   //dataOut = EncryptedFormOf(dataIn)
   BOOL bRes = CryptProtectData(
         dataIn,
         null,     //data description (optional PWideChar)
         null,     //optional entropy (PDATA_BLOB)
         null,     //reserved
         null,     //prompt struct
         CRYPTPROTECT_UI_FORBIDDEN || CRYPTPROTECT_LOCAL_MACHINE,
         ref dataOut);
   if (!bRes) then
   {
      DWORD le = GetLastError();
      throw new Win32Error(le, ""Error calling CryptProtectData"");
   }

   //Copy ciphertext from dataOut blob into an actual array
   bytes[] result;
   SetLength(result, dataOut.cbData);
   CopyMemory(dataOut.pbData, Addr(result[0]), dataOut.cbData);

   //When you have finished using the DATA_BLOB structure, free its pbData member by calling the LocalFree function
   LocalFree(HANDLE(dataOut.pbData)); //LocalFree takes a handle, not a pointer. But that's what the SDK says.
}

An important point in all this is that CryptProtectData can operate in one of two modes:

the data can only be decrypted by you (becuase it's, essentially, encrypted with your Windows password)
the data can be decrypted by anyone running on the same local machine (because it is encrypted, essentially, with the password of the local security subsystem)

CryptProtectDataWithPassword?
How to do the same with an explicit password?
The downside of CryptProtectData is that the decryption is tied to either:

me
my machine

This means that the encrypted data cannot be passed to anyone else. I need something more portable between different people. (e.g. people on other computers, people not on the same domain, people not on a domain)
Crypto API Next Gen on Windows 8 also doesn't support it
There is the bcrypt (aka BestCrypt, aka Cng, aka CryptoNG, aka Crypto NextGen, aka Cryptography Next Generation API) which provides an updated version of
the Windows 2000-era CryptProtectData called
ProtectSecret. 
This function allows you to specify who on the domain can decrypt the secret - either through an SID, e.g.:

""SID=S-1-1-0"": Everyone group 
""SID=S-1-5-32-544"": BUILTIN\Administrators group
""SID=S-1-5-32-545"": BUILTIN\Users group

Or through a certificate in your private store:

""CERTIFICATE=HashId:87b8808ecb233e0736b84b60670065b36ca615f1"": CN=youporn.com

The downside of this newer function is that:

it requires Windows 8 or newer
it only works on the domain
or with a certificate

I need it something that works with a password (i.e. a secret).
I don't want to roll my own
Does Windows have an existing high-level function to perform encryption with a password? One major virtue of Windows supporting it, is that they will return an opaque blob that supports versioning. 

If they suddenly decide to change from AES-128 to AES-256
or change the length of the salt
or suddenly decide to completely switch to GCM in CTR mode encryption with the addition of a Carter-Wegman MAC set in a Galois field

Everything is packaged into a versioned structure that contains everything needed to do the decryption, authentication. They can change the algorithm and old encrypted blobs still work, while new blobs will also work. 
Plus, i don't want to roll my own. We all know how to roll your own encryption. It's pretty easy to not screw up encryption:

oops, next version

oops, next version

So rather than me rolling my own, i would love:

something that comes with Windows 
returns an opaque blob
is vetted and tested by people with more time and knowledge than myself

The reason i don't use a libsodium is because it's not available for the language i'm using. (also it wasn't the question)

","I think you are misunderstanding how Transport Layer Security (TLS) functions. In TLS the asymmetric (public/private) encryption is used to allow two systems to agree on a form of encryption to use for communication. See the answer to this question (Which symmetric key algorithm does SSL use?) or if you are a more visual person take a look at the diagram on page 11 of this white paper (https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/protocols/ssl-tls-beginners-guide-1029).
In your specific example, what is happening (as I understand it) is that that the Client requests an SSL connection to the Broker. The Broker and Client then use public key encryption to allow the two systems to securely agree on a form of encryption and a shared key.

Now Java throws:

Finally I get a binary that looks like this

But I have expected to get an XML.
Question
I think the question is obvious.

What am I doing wrong?
Do am I loading properly the key file?
-- Answer:Yes. Problem is not here
Do am I decoding properly the input string?
-- Answer:Yes. Problem is not here
Could secret key file be corrupted? Malformed?
-- Answer:No. But it might not be the one I need

EDIT:
I have tested that web services encrypted responses can not be decrypted with the key we have. Key or algorithm might be modified by reasons why dont know and we were not aware of it

"57571152","Symmetric encryption in C# from byte-array to byte-array without streams","Is there any way of using a decent symmetric encryption from the .Net (maybe I missed something) to achieve the encryption of a source byte array to a destination byte array (both pre-allocated)? Or I have to look or code a custom AES encryption system?
The reason I need byte array to byte-array is explained below:
I'm working on adding encryption to an existing C# Socket based server. The server uses Socket.Select to handle very large amounts of non-blocking client sockets which send from time to time relatively small chunks of data on very few threads. Also the server is highly optimized speed and memory allocation wise. The server is built around the idea of sending and receiving chunks of data of maximum 16k bytes (usually only a few hundreds are actually exchanged and very rarely 1-2k). All these chunks are re-used to avoid allocations.
I've tried using .Net's SslStream, but I can't find a way to use it without 
many threads or the .Net async/begin-end mechanisms - which seem to choke at about 100+ clients (depending on os and machine power). With the SslStream I was able to use the server's allocated memory chunks, but I can't use the Socket.Select in a safe way because of the streams involved (tcp and ssl).
My next step was to try and implement the SSL socket by hand. I can transmit the server's public key to the clients, there I generate a new symmetric key with RijndaelManaged, which I then encrypt using the server's public key and send it back to the server. Everything works great, but I can't find a way to use the RijndaelManaged encryption without it's ICryptoTransform which has 2 issues: I have to create a lot of ICryptoTransform  with the CreateEncryptor (resulting in memory mess) and also it generates a new byte array after each encryption resulting in more work for the GC.
","The actual crypto operations performed by TLS after the handshake consists of symmetric encryption of the plaintext and validation of an authentication tag. Now this are exactly the operations that you do have to implement anyway to have any decent amount of security.
Of course there are ways to speed up these operations. Basically there are two ways:

hardware support for used algorithms, e.g. use a TLS provider that uses AES-NI and other hardware instructions;
algorithms that are fast within software.

Besides - of course - optimizing the software implementation itself. Managed languages such as C# or Java (which it of course is largely based on) are not very fast when it comes to implementing the many loops / shifts etc. in a cipher that basically has been created to run fast on a real CPU. Using RijndaelManaged is probably not the best way to go (did you know there is an AES.Create function?).

But let's focus on the two listed methods. 
TLS providers may already use hardware instructions, but you might make sure that your providers and platform are indeed written to support them.
Another way of making the encryption / decryption be fast is to switch to software algorithms such as Salsa20 / Poly1305, a scheme for authenticated encryption that has been brought to TLS starting with 1.2, backed by Google.

The latest version of the TLS protocol - at the time of writing - is TLS 1.3. TLS 1.3 has many methods to make the handshake more performant. Actually, if a previous secret was established it may skip it altogether. That may really help if there are many connections made rather than much data transported. So if you want to have top-notch security you might want to require TLS 1.3 and optimize for that.

And if you have done this and failed, then you can always put a TLS end point such as an actual TLS accelerator in front of your machine and simply use that. Java architectures often run on Apache Tomcat or a derived application server with a Apache webserver - configured as a proxy - in front of it. The connectors in between even send out information about the TLS connection when it is made to the application server. There are also separate hardware products that offer this kind of service, and they'll support many more TLS streams then you'll ever need, if you are prepared to spend the $$$ and the time to configure them correctly (key / certificate management).

here are certainly protocols that have different target audiences than TLS, which is a rather complicated protocol. You might be better off with a DTLS implementation, or a protocol that was created for embedded devices. But prepare for a steep learning curve and lots of work if you go into that direction.
So all in all, I would not go looking for a fast alternative to TLS, as any alternative basically has to perform the same operations. Speeding up TLS is probably a better option. What you certainly should not do is to create your own protocol and implementing TLS yourself should only be performed if you have enough experience with the subject - there are just too many pitfalls when creating transport protocol implementations.

"57571152","Symmetric encryption in C# from byte-array to byte-array without streams","Is there any way of using a decent symmetric encryption from the .Net (maybe I missed something) to achieve the encryption of a source byte array to a destination byte array (both pre-allocated)? Or I have to look or code a custom AES encryption system?
The reason I need byte array to byte-array is explained below:
I'm working on adding encryption to an existing C# Socket based server. The server uses Socket.Select to handle very large amounts of non-blocking client sockets which send from time to time relatively small chunks of data on very few threads. Also the server is highly optimized speed and memory allocation wise. The server is built around the idea of sending and receiving chunks of data of maximum 16k bytes (usually only a few hundreds are actually exchanged and very rarely 1-2k). All these chunks are re-used to avoid allocations.
I've tried using .Net's SslStream, but I can't find a way to use it without 
many threads or the .Net async/begin-end mechanisms - which seem to choke at about 100+ clients (depending on os and machine power). With the SslStream I was able to use the server's allocated memory chunks, but I can't use the Socket.Select in a safe way because of the streams involved (tcp and ssl).
My next step was to try and implement the SSL socket by hand. I can transmit the server's public key to the clients, there I generate a new symmetric key with RijndaelManaged, which I then encrypt using the server's public key and send it back to the server. Everything works great, but I can't find a way to use the RijndaelManaged encryption without it's ICryptoTransform which has 2 issues: I have to create a lot of ICryptoTransform  with the CreateEncryptor (resulting in memory mess) and also it generates a new byte array after each encryption resulting in more work for the GC.
","After extensive research I changed the way the server handles requests (basically dropped the SSL/TLS support in .net) and we are trying a TLS termination proxy before the .net server which will handle all the heavy duty tls stuff.

But this question will not be about the actual encryption...it's how to secure the thing I use to do the encrypting.
I feel like the problem I am trying to solve is a simple one:  my application needs to connect to a MySQL database on a website to fetch some information.  That requires credentials to log into the database.
The application needs to have those credentials at the ready, so that means storing them securely, such as in app.config.  I can encrypt those items and then store them easily enough.  I even took a stab at doing that, using aspnet_regiis -pef to encrypt the section of the app.config where those were stored, but that seems to be a non-portable solution (e.g. worked on my dev PC, failed to decrypt on another computer).  So if I am wrong about that, then let that be my question:  how might that have failed me?
Otherwise, my question is this:  how am I supposed to secure the key with which I encrypted the credentials?  Is there an established best practice for making the key available to the application, while still protecting it in some way?
","""You cant hide secrets""
Realistically you cannot secure anything you distribute. Your connection string is distributed in your app.config to potentially millions of customers, or at least can be copied millions of times. Your encryption algorithm may be very complex, but you must at least contain the decryption code in your .net application; which can be readily decompiled. All the hacker has to do is work out how/where your store your key. If they user doesn't supply it as part of the login process then you can't really secure the connection.
In the web application world we keep the connection string in web.config encrypted using the application pool service account credentials; only the app pool service account can read it. The user of the web site never gets access to the web.config, and if they did, the firewall between the DMZ and the database server would prevent them from attempting a connection. You lack any of these safeguards in a client-server application. 
Ideally you would provide your end user with a SQL Server login based on their windows account credentials, or a username/password; you secure their SQL account rather than the ability to attempt to connect. This is reasonably secure in an intranet scenario, as SQL Server can delegate authentication lockout etc to the Windows Server allowing you to do three-strikes based login policies; but you cannot secure the attempt to connect - only the success of the connection attempt.

","To be honest, you're not going to have a failsafe way of doing what you want - anyone you're distributing the app to can decompile and examine what you've sent them.  Literally any security scheme you can think up, the attacker can simply read the code for.
Instead, I think you should put some minor security on that end (block the casual/curious people with some straight-forward hard-coded-key encryption, knowing that you're not going to stop a determined attacker) - and instead focus on locking down the SQL end as much as possible.  Those account credentials you're giving out through your app?  Give it the bare minimum of Stored Procedures it needs to do its job, and then lock it out of all the other tables/views/etc.  Connect in to the SQL database as your app's account user, and try to see if you can perform anything malicious - screwing with table data, dropping objects, etc - and then take steps to mitigate/remove those vulnerabilities.
If that's not sufficient, your next best bet is to program a middle layer.  Make a web service, and have it be the one to connect in to SQL.  The WPF App doesn't hook into SQL at all, and has to go through the web service to get/change/etc the data.  But it's important to realize that an attacker can still screw around with your data - they can directly call your web service instead of going through the WPF app.  The only thing you gain is that the attacker doesn't have a SQL login.

You are mixing and matching encryption and decryption gear in the same object pipeline. You should probably fix that first.
Looking at AuthenticatedEncryptionFilter, the THROW_EXCEPTION | MAC_AT_END flags  are probably being coerced into the putAAD flag:
AuthenticatedEncryptionFilter(AuthenticatedSymmetricCipher &c,
    BufferedTransformation *attachment = NULL, bool putAAD=false,
    int truncatedDigestSize=-1, const std::string &macChannel=DEFAULT_CHANNEL,
    BlockPaddingScheme padding=DEFAULT_PADDING);

I seem to recall you need to avoid the Pipelines if you want to add AAD. The pipe only allows inputting data on DEFAULT_CHANNEL, which provides AE (but no AAD). Also see EAX Mode | AEAD example on the Crypto++ wiki.

Your use of FileSink and FileSource does not quite look right. I'm not sure how this is going to behave:
FileSource f(in_file, true, ...
    new FileSink(std::string(in_file).c_str()), ...);

You should probably use in_file.c_str() for the file name:
FileSource f(in_file.c_str(), ...);

You should also probably use a different file for the sink:
FileSource f(out_file.c_str(), ...);


EDIT (from the comments):

No , we don't want to add pipeline, we just want to use DEFAULT_CHANNEL for inputting data. And given example is for text input. I want to use same function for file inputting. Can you elaborate more on this?

In this case, try:
EAX<AES>::Encryption encryptor;
encryptor.SetKeyWithIV(key->key, key->key.size(), key->iv);
FileSource f(in_file.c_str(), true,
        new AuthenticatedEncryptionFilter(encryptor,
            new FileSink(out_file.c_str()));

That should input text for confidentiality and integrity (AE). It will avoid text with confidentiality only (AEAD).
Also see EAX Mode on the Crypto++ wiki. It has three or four examples with both AE and AEAD.

How to manage this generated Android Keystore private key for both (client, server) sides?
I have created a private key for encrypting and decrypting, but hard to manage for the store and share this key. 
I had stored that private key in Private SharedPreferences for reuse but There is one problem is that, this private SharedPreferences is not secured because all can observe this private SharedPreferences file in the rooted device.
Refer this link to get information about generating a private key for Android Keystore.
I'm new with tink, so please help me to out this. if there is a wrong thing in my idea then feel free to give your opinion.
","Android Keystore is a client side KMS, you cannot use it on server side.
If you want to use Tink with Android Keystore on Android, please take a look at AndroidKeysetManager. Here's an example:
 String masterKeyUri = ""android-keystore://my_master_key_id"";
 AndroidKeysetManager manager = AndroidKeysetManager.Builder()
    .withSharedPref(getApplicationContext(), ""my_keyset_name"", ""my_pref_file_name"")
    .withKeyTemplate(SignatureKeyTemplates.ECDSA_P256)
    .withMasterKeyUri(masterKeyUri)
    .build();
 PublicKeySign signer = PublicKeySignFactory.getPrimitive(manager.getKeysetHandle());

This will read a keyset stored in the my_keyset_name preference of the my_pref_file_name preferences file. If the preference file name is null, it uses the default preferences file.
If the keyset is not found or invalid, and a valid KeyTemplate is set with AndroidKeysetManager.Builder.withKeyTemplate(com.google.crypto.tink.proto.KeyTemplate), a fresh keyset is generated and is written to the my_keyset_name preference of the my_pref_file_name shared preferences file.
On Android M or newer and if a master key URI is set with AndroidKeysetManager.Builder.withMasterKeyUri(java.lang.String), the keyset is encrypted with a master key generated and stored in Android Keystore. When Tink cannot decrypt the keyset it would assume that it is not encrypted.
The master key URI must start with android-keystore://. If the master key doesn't exist, a fresh one is generated. Usage of Android Keystore can be disabled with AndroidKeysetManager.Builder.doNotUseKeystore().
On Android L or older, or when the master key URI is not set, the keyset will be stored in cleartext in private preferences which, thanks to the security of the Android framework, no other apps can read or write.

","Assuming that you are working only with lower case, you can subtract the ascii offset and convert the text and key to a value between 0-25 and then do the encryption process and add the offset at the end.
text = text - 'a';
key = key - 'a';
char encrypt = 'a' + ( text + key ) % 26

And also in your code you havent allocated memory for the 2 char pointers.

"57171328","Is it possible to search MySQL for data encrypted by CakePHP?","I am building an application that includes PII (e.g. telephone number) encrypted using CakePHP's Security Utility. I've patterned my code after the custom database recommended by @ndm -- so AES-256 encryption is taking place at the application level and then gettingpassed to a MySQL database. This is working great but I'm not sure how to implement search.
I understand that I cannot do fragment comparison (eg LIKE %%), but expect that it is possible to search for an exact match. However because Security::encrypt returns a different string each time it's used, the following will not work:
$query = $this->Users->find('all')
    ->where([
        'telephone' => Security::encrypt($search, Security::getSalt())

I searched for similar questions and found one in which the accepted answer was to create additional columns containing string hashes for each encrypted column (elsewhere this is called a blind index). I would prefer not to modify my database but can do so if this is the only solution.

I guess that breaking a key is easier when hacker has got 1000 cryptogram than he has only one cryptogram, so I think that I should use separate key for each file. 
My question is following:
Should I use separate key for each file?
If I should, there is problem with storing 1000 keys. So I want to have one secret key and use some my own algorithm to calculate separate key for each file from secret key. Is it good idea?
","If you consider passive adversary and use CPA-strong cipher (like AES), it is sufficient to use only one key for all files. Supposing adversary knows the cipher you use, and even knows plaintexts, he cannot reconstruct the key with non-negligible probability. Here is more detailed answer.
If you consider also active adversary (which can replace ciphertexts) you should use Authenticated Encryption. But as I understand this is not your case.

So I want to have one secret key and use some my own algorithm to calculate separate key for each file from secret key. Is it good idea?

In general, developing your own algorithm or scheme is bad idea. You can easily make some unseen mistake in algorithm or implementation and you data will be vulnerable. It is better to use well-known algorithms and implementations peer-reviewed by lots of people and proved to be secure.

","You can attach it however you like (at the beginning, or end, or middle if you really feel like it), or send it separately, via smoke signals if you like! As long as your decryption code knows where to find it.  At the beginning is certainly the logical place for it though (especially if you want to start decrypting before you've got the entire ciphertext).  But from a security point of view, there isn't a reason not to put it elsewhere if you have that need for some reason.
Just remember that you should assume any eavesdropper knows where you've put the IV.  You shouldn't consider that to be a secret.

Currently I have symmetric encryption with a very long key ( 4K characters ). but someone told me it is not safe enough and that I should be using travis' mechanism of asymmetric encryption. 
Can someone please explain 

Is it really less safe than travis' method? The way I see it both methods use a secret string to decrypt. 
I am currently using openssl for this procedure - is this the right tool for this task?

Adding more info to answer comments
travis' mechanism - described here: http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/
do other people need to access it? - yes. the procedure to decrypt should be known in the company, and other employees should be able to decrypt it. However people outside of the company should not be able to decrypt it. 
What am I encrypting with it? - hopefully every sensitive information the company has that is required for testing or mocking the system. We have tests on many clouds (ec2, azure, hpcloud and more..) , I would like to keep their account credentials. I would like to keep smtp credentials. credentials to services our code uses like mailchimp/mandrill. 
I would also like to encrypt our SSL certificate for the domains that we own. 
So basically, if someone will ever decrypt this file, they can potentially damage the company in many ways.

and typed test123 as the Password/KeyPhrase.
I'm assuming mcrypt will use twofish and CBC by default.
I want to use libmcrypt and write a C program to decode the contents of b.nc.
I modified the example from https://github.com/winlibs/libmcrypt/blob/master/doc/example.c
#include <mcrypt.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

main() {

    MCRYPT td;

    key=calloc(1, keysize);
    strcpy(password, ""test123"");

/* Generate the key using the password */
/*  mhash_keygen( KEYGEN_MCRYPT, MHASH_MD5, key, keysize, NULL, 0, password, strlen(password));
 */
    memmove( key, password, strlen(password));

    td = mcrypt_module_open(""twofish"", NULL, ""cbc"", NULL);
    if (td==MCRYPT_FAILED) {
        return 1;
    }
    IV = malloc(mcrypt_enc_get_iv_size(td));

/* Put random data in IV. Note these are not real random data,
 * consider using /dev/random or /dev/urandom.
 */

    /*  srand(time(0)); */
    for (i=0; i< mcrypt_enc_get_iv_size( td); i++) {
        IV[i]=rand();
    }

    i=mcrypt_generic_init( td, key, keysize, IV);
    if (i<0) {
        mcrypt_perror(i);
        return 1;
    }

    /* Encryption in CFB is performed in bytes */
    while ( fread (&block_buffer, 1, 1, stdin) == 1 ) {
        // mcrypt_generic (td, &block_buffer, 1);

/* Comment above and uncomment this to decrypt */
        mdecrypt_generic (td, &block_buffer, 1);

        fwrite ( &block_buffer, 1, 1, stdout);
    }
    mcrypt_generic_deinit(td);

    mcrypt_module_close(td);

    return 0;

}


This builds into the executable mcrypt_dev.
I tried to perform the decrypt by invoking
$ cat b.nc | ./mcrypt_dev

but it just prints junk.
I suspect I must change the logic on the while loop that reads stdin, because it was originally written for CFB and I'm using CBC instead. Perhaps there's more to be done.
Any tips would be much appreciated.

Please let me know if you think I am doing it wrong. 
","The answer was the wrong data input. We checked the content length and strewn as well, but then the device programmer realized that he had been sending me faulty encrypted data files so it wasn't working. 
Also, to preserve the format of data, we had to use Request.BinaryRead() instead of Request.inputStream. 
Otherwise, code works. Thank you all!!

Is it a good idea to use JOSE JWE libraries for that purpose?
Is there any other option you can recommend?
Thanks,

","This is not a good idea.
JWE stands for Encrypted JSON Web tokens and is meant to be used in a web context (i.e. HTTP/HTTPS protocols).
The payload is encrypted but also encoded in base64 url safe and thus the size of the encrypted payload will be larger than the original file (approx. +30% overhead) plus the header, encrypted CEK and IV.
A 1GB file will be encrypted into a 1.3GB token…
You should definitively choose a dedicated and secured file transfert protocol e.g. SCP or SFTP

I am trying to do chain block cipher on an image and this is part of the code. I have been able to get the hex code of an image, encrypt it using chain block cipher, and decrypt it. I then compared the decrypted hex code with the original input hex code and I get a successful match. The hex code is returned as a list instead of a byte array though but the if statement still recognizes them as equal. I am having trouble converting the hexcode back into an image though.
I get this error. OSError: cannot identify image file <_io.BytesIO object at 0x039F1090>
The image is all black pixels for test purposes to make it easy to confirm the integrity of the hex code which I have confirmed to be identical to the input.
What is preventing me from turning the hexcode back into an image? I have tried looking everywhere for examples that worked but I have never been able to fully understand why it worked. Here is my logic.
immage_array is a list == (0, 0, 0, 0, ..., n)
bytes() #turns the immage_array list of all integers 0 into a byte array all consisting of x00.
io.BytesIO() A function needed for the byte array to be manipulated by the Image.open() function.
I then have the byte array stored as an object in the variable image.
image.save(output.png) The save function takes the filename as an argument. The image object is used.
I have honestly tried my hardest to find out where the logic is failing. I would appreciate an explanation of how to turn a list of (0, 0, 0, ..., n) into an image. Yes, I know, I have seen other examples of it being done on stack overflow. I am wondering why my implementation of it is failing.
","I just re-read your question. You cannot do this if your immage_array is [0, 0, 0...]. That is not an image, it is a bitmap (subtle difference). Use the PIL.Image.frombytes constructor.
If you want to encrypt images, just encrypt the whole contents, rather than extracting the file contents, converting it to a bitmap, then encrypting/decrypting it. When you convert it to a bitmap, for starters, it will be an order of magnitude more data, and secondly you loose the information on what format the image is (RGB, ARGB, monochrome, etc.)
As you have now disclosed, you are using the PIL.Image.getdata method. This returns a one-dimensional list, so how are you going to know the width/height at the other end? i.e. if your image is 640x480, from the other end you can't tell if it will be 480x640 or even 307200x1

"58356369","How to encrypt data using a private key/password that is itself encrypted?","I want to encrypt some data (some simple text) using Java in a way that:

I have to provide the encoding key/password once to the server the application will run on.
The application can then encrypt data by itself, using the previously stored key.
An attacker who would gain access to the server wouldn't  be able to get the stored key.

In other words, I want my application to be able to encrypt some data by itself, without requiring the key every time, and I want this key to be encrypted itself (not stored in plain text) so an attacker couldn't get it.
What tools/technics can I use to achieve that?
","
An attacker who would gain access to the server wouldn't be able to get the stored key

This is generally a problem, mainly when having an encryption key next to your data. Once the key is leakt, nothing prevents the attacker to decrypt the data. You main task is preventing the attacker to get the access to the key in first place (I know, it's easy to say).  
Seems you want to keep the key only in memory, that may be a good idea in many cases. When decrypting, at the end the key needs to be in the memory anyway. 

I want this key to be encrypted itself (not stored in plain text) 

Then you need to store and maintain an encryption key to encrypt the first key. And you have the same issue to protect both of the keys. 
Suggestion:
I see often solutions using external services to manage the keys or do the cryptographic operations (a key vault, key management service, HSM, TPM,.. ). However - if an attacker gains full application-level access, he may use the same services to decrypt the data.
But at least if data are leakt (in my experience often backups or old copies are leakt), these services would help to make the data unaccessible.

I installed it from https://www.bouncycastle.org/documentation.html and opened it on Eclipse. But I don't know how I use it. Can anybody help for this?
","There are basically two ways to use Bouncy Castle, by which I mean the cryptographic library and provider - which is the core package. The other packages can be used as any other library.
First of all, there is the lightweight API, which simply is a standalone cryptographic library. It has it's own architecture which is significantly different from the Java Cryptographic Architecture or the JCA (which comes with every version of Java). It doesn't use a service oriented architecture, which is probably the major difference. Instead it relies on inheritance when creating the algorithms. So you'd use new CBCBlockCipher(new AESEngine()) rather than Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/NoPadding"").
Furthermore, you can install it as a cryptographic provider in Java and Android. For this you can e.g. use a call such as: Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider()). This will register the provider, and the algorithms that are registered within the provider are now available through the JCA. For instance, you can now use Cipher.getInstance(""Camellia/CBC/NoPadding"").
You can also use Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"", ""BC"") to explicitly select the Java implementation of AES in Bouncy Castle instead of the default one provided by Java. Generally however you would use the default ones, as they may e.g. be backed up by AES-NI instructions within the processor you are using.

"58174895","How does an encryption algorithm actually encrypt data","What I want to know, is not how encryption works, what are keys etc <- I kinda got that, like how DH works, and I did learn asymmetric keys a while back, but I'll probably need to refresh on that.
What I want to know is how does the key turn some plaintext like ""HELLO"" into ciphertext such as ""MQPCT""
What actually happens to the string during the process, does each character get turned into a number somehow? That sort of thing
Hopefully my question makes sense
","To answer your question about what happens to the string during the process - the string is decoded into bits, then the bits are encrypted.  
Most modern encryption protocols ultimately use AES symmetric encryption to encrypt the message, using a secret key shared by both the sender of the message and the recipient.  The message is broken up into blocks of 128 bits (and usually padded), then the AES algorithm is used to encrypt these bits.  For information on how AES does this, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard.

","Notice that crypto.createCipher(algorithm, password[, options]) is deprecated and should not be used.
Where the SecretKeySpec(..) in java takes a binary key as input, the createCipher(..) in js takes a ""password"" as input, and behind the scene tries to derive a binary key using MD5. So your actually key used in the two programs ends up being different. The js methode 
also tries to derive an IV from the password, which is bad practice and different from your java code.
In js you need to use the crypto.createCipheriv() instead. And when you are at it, you also need to consider if an iv is needed - both in Java and in js.

I'm new to Django and believe I need to setup a user model and use that model somehow to solve the problem but I'm not sure how and cannot find any information to help. I believe I need a special model because that's how you store and retrieve user information but I could be wrong.
*from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser*

*from django.db import models*

*class CustomUser(AbstractUser):*

*age = models.PositiveIntegerField(null=True, blank=True)*

*key = models.??????*

The actual results should be as follows:
A user logs in and chooses from a list of users that they have ""befriended"" so to speak where they both share the same symmetric key(<--the topic of question). That user then takes plaintext such as a sentence or paragraph and pastes this information into an HTML form where they can click submit. Upon submission the plaintext is encrypted using the key respective of the intended recipient. Then that information runs through a encryption algorithm and returns ciphertext. That user then takes that ciphertext and emails (for example) it to the intended friend. That friend can then login to the same application used by the sender and choose that sender as the message's origin. Then the recipient user will take the ciphertext, again paste it into a HTML form where when they click submit the application will use the message's original symmetric key to decrypt the garbled text into plaintext.

Cast the bytes to a string


string_iv = str(bytes_iv, 'utf-8')

Serialize the string using SerializeToString():


serialized_iv = IV.SerializeToString()

Use ParseToString() to recover the string:


IV.ParseFromString( serialized_iv )

And finally, UTF-8 encode the string back to bytes: 


bytes_iv = bytes(IV.string_iv, encoding= 'utf-8')

","If you must cast an arbitrary bytes object to str, these are your option:

simply call str() on the object. It will turn it into repr form, ie. something that could be parsed as a bytes literal, eg. ""b'abc\x00\xffabc'""

use base64 or base85 encoding (the standard library has a base64 module wich covers both)
