A keystore contains private keys. You only need this if you are
a server, or if the server requires client authentication.
A truststore contains CA certificates to trust. If your server’s
certificate is signed by a recognized CA, the default truststore
that ships with the JRE will already trust it (because it already
trusts trustworthy CAs), so you don’t need to build your own,
or to add anything to the one from the JRE.

","In a SSL handshake the purpose of trustStore is to verify credentials and the purpose of keyStore is to provide credential. 
keyStore
keyStore in Java stores private key and certificates corresponding to their public keys and require if you are SSL Server or SSL requires client authentication. 
TrustStore
TrustStore stores certificates from third party, your Java application communicate or certificates signed by CA(certificate authorities like Verisign, Thawte, Geotrust or GoDaddy) which can be used to identify third party. 
TrustManager
TrustManager determines whether remote connection should be trusted or not i.e. whether remote party is who it claims to and KeyManager decides which authentication credentials should be sent to the remote host for authentication during SSL handshake.
If you are an SSL Server you will use private key during key exchange algorithm and send certificates corresponding to your public keys to client, this certificate is acquired from keyStore. On SSL client side, if its written in Java, it will use certificates stored in trustStore to verify identity of Server. SSL certificates are most commonly comes as .cer file which is added into keyStore or trustStore by using any key management utility e.g. keytool.

In Java, what's the difference between a keystore and a truststore?

Here's the description from the Java docs at Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) Reference Guide. I don't think it tells you anything different from what others have said. But it does provide the official reference.

keystore/truststore
A keystore is a database of key material. Key material is used for a variety of purposes, including authentication and data integrity.
  Various types of keystores are available, including PKCS12 and
  Oracle's JKS.
Generally speaking, keystore information can be grouped into two categories: key entries and trusted certificate entries. A key entry
  consists of an entity's identity and its private key, and can be used
  for a variety of cryptographic purposes. In contrast, a trusted
  certificate entry contains only a public key in addition to the
  entity's identity. Thus, a trusted certificate entry cannot be used
  where a private key is required, such as in a
  javax.net.ssl.KeyManager. In the JDK implementation of JKS, a keystore
  may contain both key entries and trusted certificate entries.
A truststore is a keystore that is used when making decisions about what to trust. If you receive data from an entity that you
  already trust, and if you can verify that the entity is the one that
  it claims to be, then you can assume that the data really came from
  that entity.
An entry should only be added to a truststore if the user trusts that entity. By either generating a key pair or by importing a
  certificate, the user gives trust to that entry. Any entry in the
  truststore is considered a trusted entry.
It may be useful to have two different keystore files: one containing just your key entries, and the other containing your
  trusted certificate entries, including CA certificates. The former
  contains private information, whereas the latter does not. Using two
  files instead of a single keystore file provides a cleaner separation
  of the logical distinction between your own certificates (and
  corresponding private keys) and others' certificates. To provide more
  protection for your private keys, store them in a keystore with
  restricted access, and provide the trusted certificates in a more
  publicly accessible keystore if needed.

"318441","Truststore and Keystore Definitions","What's the difference between a keystore and a truststore?
","
First and major difference between trustStore and keyStore is that trustStore is used by TrustManager to determine whether remote connection should be trusted, keyStore is used from KeyManager deciding which authentication credentials should be sent to the remote host for authentication during SSL handshake.
Another difference is that keyStore theoretically contains private keys required only if you are running a Server in SSL connection or you have enabled client authentication on server side and on the other hand trustStore stores public key or certificates from CA (Certificate Authorities) which are used to trust remote party or SSL connection. 
In fact you can store in the same file both private and public keys,
given that the the tool to manage those file is the same (keytool),
so you could use a single file for both the purposes, but you
probably should not.
At least on my Mac OSX the default keyStore is ${user.home}/.keystore, and the default trustStore is /System/Library/Java/Support/CoreDeploy.bundle/Contents/Home/lib/security/cacerts. 
If you want to override them you should add the JVM parameters
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore /path/to/keyStore or
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore /path/to/trustStore. You might also
need to set the keyStore password in case of
java.security.UnrecoverableKeyException: Password must not be
null, using the parameter
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=password or -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=password

","The definition of RSA tells you that the modulus n = pq. You know n so you just need to find two numbers p and q that multiply to produce n. You know that p and q are prime, so this is the prime factorisation problem.

","Here's a relatively simple way to look at it (and one that is doable by hand). If you were to factor the number completely, then the highest factor you would need to consider is sqrt(N):
sqrt(10142789312725007) = 100711415.9999997567

The first prime below this is 100711409, just 6 below the sqrt(N). 
10142789312725007 / 100711409 = 100711423 

therefore these are two factors of N. Your professor made it pretty easy - the trick is to recognize that no one would choose a small p or q so starting your check from the bottom (as in the python script someone posted) is a bad idea. If it's going to be practical by hand, the large p and q must lie near sqrt(N).

Since the number is too big to fit into a conventional integer (even 64-bit), you might want a numeric library that supports arbitrary-lenth integers. For C, there's GMP and MPIR (more Windows-friendly). For PHP, there's Bignum. Python comes with a built-in one - the built-in integer datatype is already arbitrary-length.

","Your teacher gave you: 

Public Key: (10142789312725007, 5)

which means
n = 10142789312725007
e = 5 

where n is the modulus and e is the public exponent.
In addition, you're given

Private Key: (10142789312725007, 8114231289041741)

meaning that
 d = 8114231289041741

where d is the decryption exponent that should remain secret. 
You can ""break"" RSA by knowing how to factor ""n"" into its ""p"" and ""q"" prime factors:
n = p * q

The easiest way is probably to check all odd numbers starting just below the square root of n:
Floor[Sqrt[10142789312725007]] = 100711415

You would get the first factor in 4 tries:
10142789312725007 mod 100711415 = 100711367
10142789312725007 mod 100711413 = 100711373
10142789312725007 mod 100711411 = 100711387
10142789312725007 mod 100711409 = 0 <-- Winner since it evenly divides n

So we have
 p = 100711409

Now,
 q = n / p 
   = 10142789312725007 / 100711409
   = 100711423

Why is this important? It's because d is a special number such that 
d = e^-1 mod phi(n)
  = e^-1 mod (p-1)*(q-1)

We can verify this
d * e = 40571156445208705 = 1 mod 10142789111302176

This is important because if you have a plaintext message m then the ciphertext is
c = m^e mod n

and you decrypt it by
m = c^d = (m^e)^d = (m^(e*d)) = (m^(e*e^-1)) = m^1 (mod n)

For example, I can ""encrypt"" the message 123456789 using your teacher's public key:
m = 123456789

This will give me the following ciphertext:
c = m^e mod n 
  = 123456789^5 mod 10142789312725007
  = 7487844069764171

(Note that ""e"" should be much larger in practice because for small values of ""m"" you don't even exceed n)
Anyways, now we have ""c"" and can reverse it with ""d""
m = c^d mod n
  = 7487844069764171^8114231289041741 mod 10142789312725007
  = 123456789

Obviously, you can't compute ""7487844069764171^8114231289041741"" directly because it has 128,808,202,574,088,302 digits, so you must use the modular exponentiation trick.
In the ""Real World"", n is obviously much larger. If you'd like to see a real example of how HTTPS uses RSA under the covers with a 617-digit n and an e of 65537, see my blog post ""The First Few Milliseconds of an HTTPS Connection.""

The algorithm is essentially a careful elaboration of Henno Brandsma's answer to this very question.
UPDATE Sep 25, 2019:
In the comment below, user Imperishable Night suggests an alternative method which should be at least conceptually easier to understand.
He notes that usually e is small. In fact e is almost always 65537. In the case that e is small you can develop a quadratic equation in the unknown prime p and thus easily solve for it using e.g. the quadratic formula. To proceed, lets set x=p and solve for x, just to stick with convention. We know that ed = 1 mod phi(n), or equivalently 
ed - 1 = k * (p-1)*(q-1). Now setting x=p, and therefore n/x=q, multiplying both sides by x and rearranging terms we have
k*x2 + (d*e - k*n - k - 1)*x + k*n = 0.
 Now we have an equation
of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 and we can solve for x using the quadratic formula. So we can try values of k in a small range around e and there should be only one integer solution to the quadratic, the solution for the correct k. 
Notes:

Everything must be an integer, thus the discriminant must be a perfect square or we can discard k and try the next one. Also, the numerator must be divisible by 2*k.
Sometimes the Carmichael lambda function is used in place of the Euler phi function. This complicates things just a little bit because we must now also guess the g = gcd(p-1, q-1). g is always even, is often 2, and is otherwise almost always a small multiple of 2.

UPDATE Sep 26, 2019:
Finding k is actually very easy when e is small. By taking the equation
ed - 1 = k * (p-1)*(q-1) and dividing both sides by n it is fairly easy to see that floor((ed-1)/n) + 1 == k. Now using equations
31 and 32 of M.J. Wiener's ""Cryptanalysis of Short RSA Secret Exponents"" one can directly recover p and q.

    (a trivial root of 1, mod n) and we redo with a different a, or some number x which does not equal +1 or -1 mod n.
    In the latter case gcd(x-1, n) is a non-trivial divisor of n, and so p or q, and we are done. One can show that a random a will work with probability about 0.5, so we need a few tries, but not very many in general.

","Sorry for the necromancy, but a friend asked me about this, and after pointing him here, I realized that I didn't really like any of the answers.  After factoring the modulus and getting the primes (p and q), you need to find the totient, which is (p-1)*(q-1).
Now, to find the private exponent, you find the inverse of the public exponent mod the totient.
public_exponent * private_exponent = 1 mod totient

And now you have your private key, that easy.  All of this except for the factorization can be done almost instantly for huge integers.
I wrote some code:
// tinyrsa.c
//
// apt-get install libgmp-dev
// yum install gmp-devel
//
// gcc tinyrsa.c -o tinyrsa -lm -lgmp

#include<stdio.h>
#include<gmp.h>

int main()
{
  // declare some multi-precision integers
  mpz_t pub_exp, priv_exp, modulus, totient, fac_p, fac_q, next_prime;

  mpz_init_set_str(pub_exp,""5"",10);
  mpz_init_set_str(modulus,""10142789312725007"",10);

  mpz_init(priv_exp);
  mpz_init(totient);
  mpz_init(fac_p);
  mpz_init(fac_q);

  // now we factor the modulus (the hard part)
  mpz_init(next_prime);
  mpz_sqrt(next_prime,modulus);
  unsigned long removed=0;
  while(!removed)
  {
    mpz_nextprime(next_prime,next_prime);
    removed=mpz_remove(fac_p,modulus,next_prime);
  }

  mpz_remove(fac_q,modulus,fac_p);
  // we now have p and q

  // the totient is (p-1)*(q-1)  
  mpz_t psub, qsub;
  mpz_init(psub);
  mpz_init(qsub);

  mpz_sub_ui(psub,fac_p,1);
  mpz_sub_ui(qsub,fac_q,1);
  mpz_mul(totient,psub,qsub);

  // inverse of the public key, mod the totient..
  mpz_invert(priv_exp,pub_exp,totient);

  gmp_printf(""private exponent:\n%Zd\n"",priv_exp);

}

The factorization algorithm I used is stupid, but concise, so grain of salt there.  In this particular example the code runs almost instantly, but that is largely because the instructor in question provided an example that uses two primes in a row, which isn't really realistic for RSA.
If you wanted to cut out my stupid iterative search, you could put in some real factorization algorithm, and factor keys likely up to around 256 bits in a reasonable amount of time.

","Yes, it's possible.  Google ""multiparty encryption"" for a start.
AFAIK, there are no drop 'em in and use 'em packages for it though.
-- MarkusQ
P.S. For a sketch of how it could be done, consider this.  The encrypted message consists of:

the payload, encrypted with a one-time pad
the one time pad, encrypted with key1
the one time pad, encrypted with key2
...
the one time pad, encrypted with keyN

The recipient who hold key i just decrypts their copy of the pad with their key, and then decrypts the payload.
However, this is just a proof that it could be done and would suck as an actual implementation.  If at all possible, you should avoid rolling your own encryption.  If you don't understand why, you should definitely avoid rolling your own encryption.

d==(e1*e2*e3*...*ei)^(-1) (mod fi(m)); e1...ei are arbitrary numbers, d is calculated to fulfill the equation

Yes encryption for multiple recipients is possible. Also it seems logical when you think that you might want to be able to read what you've sent to someone and to do so you need to be in the recipients list.

Mechanism
There is a question on Information Security, GPG File size with multiple recipients?, that explain the encryption mechanism:

GPG encrypts the file once with a symmetric key, then places a header
  identifying the target keypair and an encrypted version of the
  symmetric key. 
[...] When encrypted to multiple recipients, this
  header is placed multiple times providing a uniquely encrypted version
  of the same symmetric key for each recipient.

","GnuPG and PGP clients in general usually encrypt the actual data with a symmetric key called a ""session key"".  The session key is then encrypted with each ""recipient key"" (i.e. the ones you specify with -r/--recipient).  This is sometimes referred to as a hybrid cipher.  Right now, I believe GnuPG by default uses an 256 bit session keys and AES to encrypt the plaintext data to that AES-256 session key, and your recipient keys are your RSA/DSA/ECDSA/etc. assymetric key in this case.
One reason for doing it this way is that symmetric cryptographic algorithms like AES are generally a lot faster than asymmetric ones like RSA.  GnuPG thus only has to encrypt ~256 bits (the session key) with RSA, and can use AES to encrypt the data (as large as you want it to be!) with that session key.  Intel machines even have a built in instruction, AES-NI, to do some steps of the algorithm in hardware, which makes GnuPG extra snappy at encrypting/decrypting data.
Another reason for doing it this way is that it allows PGP-encrypted documents to be encrypted to multiple parties without having to double the size of the document.  Notice that when you specify multiple recipients for an encrypted document (e.g. gpg -ea -r Alice -r Bob -o ciphertext.asc), the encrypted document that gets stored (ciphertext.asc) is not 2x as large as if you had just encrypted it to Alice.
See also the --show-session-key parameter in the gpg man page to be able to decrypt just the session key, for example to allow a third party to decrypt a document that is encrypted to you without having to transfer to them your private key or the plaintext data.

Just call the 'RSA' method with the text you want to encrypt and you're done.
","Are you speaking about certificates stored in file?
If you have an object like:
X509Certificate2 certificate;

you can use following code:
RSACryptoServiceProvider rsaprovider =
                    (RSACryptoServiceProvider)certificate.PublicKey.Key;

and then use the class RSACryptoServiceProvider (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.rsacryptoserviceprovider.aspx).
To load an X509Certificate2 use its constructor (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.x509certificates.x509certificate2.aspx).
This program works fine for me:
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        try 
        {
            X509Certificate2 certificate = 
                new X509Certificate2(""<PFX Certificate Path"", ""<Certificate-Password>"");
            RSACryptoServiceProvider rsaprovider = (RSACryptoServiceProvider)certificate.PublicKey.Key;
        }
        catch(Exception e)
        {

        }
    }

Just call the 'RSA' method with the text you want to encrypt and you're done.
","You can create an RSACryptoServiceProvider from a PEM file using the following class (GetRSAProviderFromPemFile method).
Warning:
Don't just copy code from StackOverflow without verification! Especially not crypto code! This code has bugs (see comments). You may want to write and run tests before using this in production (if you really have no better option). I refuse to edit the code to fix it, as it would be just as unreliable as before without tests and an active maintainer.

","TL;DR: Ursa is your best bet. Its really funky that this doesn't come standard with node crypto.
Every other solutions I found either doesn't work in windows or aren't actually encryption libraries. Ursa, recommended by Louie, looks like the best bet. If you don't care about windows, you're even more golden. Note on Ursa, I had to install Open SSL along with something called ""Visual C++ 2008 Redistributables"" in order to get the npm install to work. Get that junk here: http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html 
The breakdown:

Annoying additional manual installation steps for windows

https://github.com/Obvious/ursa - probably the best of the lot

Not compatible with windows

https://npmjs.org/package/rsautl - says BADPLATFORM
https://github.com/katyo/node-rsa - node-waf isn't available on windows
https://github.com/paspao/simple_rsa_encrypt - unistd.h isn't on windows
https://npmjs.org/package/pripub - large amounts of linker errors, also not on github

Not encryption libraries

https://github.com/substack/secure-peer
https://github.com/substack/rsa-json - just generates keys, doesn't use them
https://github.com/substack/rsa-unpack - just unpacks PEM strings

","No library necessary friends,
Enter crypto
Here's a janky little module you could use to encrypt/decrypt strings with RSA keys:
var crypto = require(""crypto"");
var path = require(""path"");
var fs = require(""fs"");

var encryptStringWithRsaPublicKey = function(toEncrypt, relativeOrAbsolutePathToPublicKey) {
    var absolutePath = path.resolve(relativeOrAbsolutePathToPublicKey);
    var publicKey = fs.readFileSync(absolutePath, ""utf8"");
    var buffer = Buffer.from(toEncrypt);
    var encrypted = crypto.publicEncrypt(publicKey, buffer);
    return encrypted.toString(""base64"");
};

var decryptStringWithRsaPrivateKey = function(toDecrypt, relativeOrAbsolutePathtoPrivateKey) {
    var absolutePath = path.resolve(relativeOrAbsolutePathtoPrivateKey);
    var privateKey = fs.readFileSync(absolutePath, ""utf8"");
    var buffer = Buffer.from(toDecrypt, ""base64"");
    var decrypted = crypto.privateDecrypt(privateKey, buffer);
    return decrypted.toString(""utf8"");
};

module.exports = {
    encryptStringWithRsaPublicKey: encryptStringWithRsaPublicKey,
    decryptStringWithRsaPrivateKey: decryptStringWithRsaPrivateKey
}

I would recommend not using synchronous fs methods where possible, and you could use Promises to make this better, but for simple use cases this is the approach that I have seen work and would take

I am now getting the error: bad length. 
With a smaller string it works, any ideas what the problem could be the string I am passing is under 200 characters.
","RSA encryption is only mean for small amounts of data, the amount of data you can encrypt is dependent on the size of the key you are using, for example for 1024 bit RSA keys, and PKCS # 1 V1.5 padding, you can encrypt 117 bytes at most, with a 2048 RSA key, you can encrypt 245 bytes.
There's a good reason for this, asymmetric encryption is computationally expensive. If you want to encrypt large amounts of data you should be using symmetric encryption. But what if you want non-repudiation? Well what you then do is use both. You create a symmetric key and exchange it using asymmetric encryption, then that safely exchanged symmetric key to encrypt your large amounts of data. This is what SSL and WS-Secure use underneath the covers.

","For future searches regarding RSA bad length exceptions...
You can calculate the max number of bytes which can be encrypted with a particular key size with the following:
((KeySize - 384) / 8) + 37

However, if the optimal asymmetric encryption padding (OAEP) parameter is true, as it is in the original post, the following can be used to calculate the max bytes:
((KeySize - 384) / 8) + 7

The legal key sizes are 384 thru 16384 with a skip size of 8.

","As explained above, the solution to the 'bad length' type exceptions is to hybridize the use of symmetric and asymmetric encryption, so that the size of the text you are encrypting is not constrained by the key size.  You basically use RSA encryption to asymmetrically encrypt the random key .

For encryption:

Generate a random key of the length required for symmetrical encryption technique such as AES or Rijndael.
Symmetrically encrypt your text/data using AES/Rijndael using the random key generated in step 1.
Using RSA, asymmetrically encrypt the random key generated in step 1.

For decryption:

First decrypt the AES/Rijndael-generated random key using your private RSA key.
Then decrypt the original text/data using the RSA-decrypted random key

","Normally, you use public key encryption to encrypt a symmetric key, in part because public key encryption is very slow. Typically, you'd send the recipient the following, so that they can decrypt your message:

The symmetric key, encrypted with the recipient's public key.
Parameters for the algorithms used, usually an initialization vector for the symmetric cipher.
Identifiers for the encryption algorithms used.
The ciphertext—the actual message, encrypted under the symmetric cipher.

I found the sample code in the JCE documentation sufficient to get things working.
The standard format for bundling all of this information up is the Cryptographic Message Syntax, or CMS, which is used by S/MIME in email applications. I recommend using Bouncy Castle's libraries; they are solid, fairly simple, and actively maintained. The reference documentation is a bit weak, but they do provide code examples.

Note Well: As emboss mentions in the comments, this answer is a poor fit for an actual system.

public_key_file = 'public.pem';
string = 'Hello World!';

public_key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new(File.read(public_key_file))

","I'm afraid you are mixing two concepts here, authentication/authorization and confidentiality, trying to cover both aspects in one single step, and that won't work. You should never encrypt ""real data"" with asymmetric algorithms. a) they are way too slow for that, b) there are subtle issues that, if not done right, will severely weaken the security of your solution. 
A good rule of thumb is that the only thing you should end up encrypting with private asymmetric keys is symmetric keys used by a much faster symmetric algorithm. But in almost all cases you shouldn't even be doing that, because in 90% of the cases what you actually want is TLS (SSL) in those cases - I tried to explain why here a while ago.
In your case, I assume the requirements are:

confidentiality of the data that is to be stored in the database: the general public shouldn't be able to read it (or even access it)
a selected few (probably just one person) should be able to access and read that data

The first goal is generally achieved by using symmetric encryption. The second goal is, albeit related, realized by quite different means. You want the user accessing the file to be authenticated (i.e. establish the identity) and on top of that you also want them to be authorized (i.e. check whether the established identity has the right to do what they intend to). This is where asymmetric cryptography may enter the stage, but not necessarily. Since your question is tagged with Rails I assume we are talking about a Rails application. You typically already have some means to authenticate and authorize users there (most likely involving the afore-mentioned TLS), you may simply reuse them in order to establish a symmetric key for actual file encryption/decryption. Password-based encryption would fit for this purpose, if you want to avoid asymmetric crypto at all. Things get even more complicated if you also want to ensure integrity of the already confidential data, that is, you want to give a kind of guarantee to the authenticated and authorized user in the sense that what they finally access has not been altered in any way in the meantime. 
Developing a solution for this will be no trivial task and depend to a large extent on your given requirements, so I'm afraid there's no ""golden way"" that suits everyone. I would suggest to do some research, get a clearer picture of what you are trying to achieve and how, then try to get additional advice on subjects that you still feel uncertain/uncomfortable with.

","I made a gem to help with this. It's called cryptosystem. Simply configure the path and password to your private key as well as the path to your public key, and it does the rest.

","Symmetric Encryption is definitely fast and has excellent support for streaming of very large files.
SymmetricEncryption::Writer.open('my_file.enc') do |file|
  file.write ""Hello World\n""
  file.write ""Keep this secret""
end

Symmetric Encryption is designed for encrypting data and large files within an organization. 
When it comes to sharing files with other organizations then the best option is PGP. For streaming of very large files with PGP consider: IOStreams
IOStreams.writer('hello.pgp', recipient: 'receiver@example.org') do |writer|
  writer.write('Hello World')
  writer.write('and some more')
end

Look at the file iostreams/lib/io_streams/pgp.rb for more PGP examples. It also supports PGP key management directly from Ruby.

","In our applications, we store public and private keys in DER format so they can be used and manipulated outside java more easily.  In our case, the private keys do not have passwords on them.
To convert the private key to something more easily usable in java:
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in key.pem -inform PEM -out key.der -outform DER

Then you can obtain an RSA private key directly by:
public static RSAPrivateKey getPrivateKey(File privateKeyFile) throws IOException, GeneralSecurityException {
    byte[] keyBytes = new byte[(int)privateKeyFile.length()];
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(privateKeyFile);
    fis.read(keyBytes);
    PKCS8EncodedKeySpec spec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(keyBytes);
    KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
    RSAPrivateKey privKey = (RSAPrivateKey) keyFactory.generatePrivate(spec);
    return privKey;
}

The public key is similar:
openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -outform DER -out public.der

and to read it:
public static RSAPublicKey getPublicKey(File publicKeyFile) throws IOException, GeneralSecurityException {
    byte[] keyBytes = new byte[(int)publicKeyFile.length()];
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(publicKeyFile);
    fis.read(keyBytes);
    X509EncodedKeySpec publicKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(keyBytes);
    KeyFactory factory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
    RSAPublicKey pubKey = (RSAPublicKey)factory.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);
    return pubKey;
}

Many people store then keystores.  For our purposes, we needed the same key to be shared across multiple applications in several different languages, and didn't want to duplicate the files on disk.  
In either case, the performance shouldn't be a huge concern, because you're likely to store those keys in some sort of Singleton or cache instead of regenerating them each time.

","You're actually storing the bytes in both cases whether you realize it or not. I suppose the correct answer is hinted at in @Brian M. Carr answer, which is to store the higher-level object in its most natural form. In the case of public keys, the obvious choices are as a PKCS#1 RSAPublicKey ASN.1 structure, DER-encoded, or as an X509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo ASN.1 structure, DER-encoded. The latter is what the Sun providers give you, which the sun class X509EncodedKeySpec supports. Similarly, the PKCS8EncodedKeySpec supports a private key format. Both these formats are standards, and are supported by openssl for example. Sun tends -- tended :( -- to support existing standards rather then define their own.

"8417993","RSA Encryption of large data in C#","This is my first post, so hope I haven't missed anything important. I'm doing a project in C# where I need to use public/private key encryption to encrypt a message and then send it over an SSL connection.
I chose to use the RSACryptoService, as according to the documentation, that was the only asymmetric encryption scheme used for encrypting data. The problem is  that I am having a lot of problems with this. (I wanted to do symmetric encryption, but that is not what my teacher want me to do, and according to him it should be easy to just determine a block size and then it should do all the work for you.) Well, so far no luck and I've tried some different approaches, but now I'm back to basics and trying again, this is my current code:
    public string[] GenerateKeysToStrings(string uniqueIdentifier)
    {
        string[] keys;
        using (var rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(4096))
        {
            try
            {
                string privateKey = rsa.ToXmlString(true);
                string publicKey = rsa.ToXmlString(false);

                this.pki.StoreKey(publicKey, uniqueIdentifier);

                keys = new string[2];
                keys[0] = privateKey;
                keys[1] = publicKey;
            }
            finally
            {
                //// Clear the RSA key container, deleting generated keys.
                rsa.PersistKeyInCsp = false;
            }
        }
        return keys;
    }

As you can see, I generate the keys and I mimmick a PKI by sending the public key to a simple class that stores it, and then the private key is written to a file
(Notice that I also have another method that does the same but stores it to an array instead, just because I wanted to test and simplify things as I get No such key exceptions and sometimes cryptographic exceptions when I do it the way shown in the example, so I wanted to simplify it by simply storing the rsa.ToXmlString string, as a string in an array, but no luck.)
Now I have an encrypt and decrypt method as follows:
    public string Encrypt(string keyString, string message)
    {
        string encryptedMessage;
        using (var rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider())
        {
            try
            {
                //// Load the key from the specified path
                var encryptKey = new XmlDocument();
                encryptKey.Load(@""C:\Test\PrivateKeyInfo.xml"");
                rsa.FromXmlString(encryptKey.OuterXml);


                //// Conver the string message to a byte array for encryption

I know that this is a wall of text, but I hope you can help me out because I've been banging my head against the wall for so long now it's not funny :)
The problem is, how do I go about encrypting messages with RSA (or any other public/private key encryption)
Here is the Test client:
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        PublicKeyInfrastructure pki = new PublicKeyInfrastructure();
        Cryptograph crypto = new Cryptograph();
        string[] keys = crypto.GenerateKeysToStrings(""simonlanghoff@gmail.com"");


        string plainText = ""Hello play with me, please"";
        string publicKey = crypto.GetPublicKey(""simonlanghoff@gmail.com"");

        string encryptedText = crypto.Encrypt(keys[0], plainText);


        string decryptedText = crypto.Decrypt(keys[1], encryptedText);

    }

As I mentioned, the string arrays are there because I wanted to eliminate bad parsing error from XML documents...
When I run the test client, if I use the private key to encrypt and public key to decrypt, I get a ""Key does not exist exception"" and if I do it the other way around, I get a bad data exception.
Please help me out guys, if you know of any good guide, or can tell me how to somewhat straightfoward implement public/private key encryption on string messages, please help me out.
I appreciate any help.
","This is not how RSA encryption should be done. 
RSA is all about math. What you encrypt is a number so it has to be of finite length and matching the RSA keypair length you're using. Further length limitations are imposed by the padding used (either PKCS#1 or OAEP).
If you want to encrypt large data with RSA you need to do it indirectly - i.e. use a symmetric key to encrypt the large data and encrypt this key using the RSA public key.
You can read about implementing this on my blog.

"8417993","RSA Encryption of large data in C#","This is my first post, so hope I haven't missed anything important. I'm doing a project in C# where I need to use public/private key encryption to encrypt a message and then send it over an SSL connection.
I chose to use the RSACryptoService, as according to the documentation, that was the only asymmetric encryption scheme used for encrypting data. The problem is  that I am having a lot of problems with this. (I wanted to do symmetric encryption, but that is not what my teacher want me to do, and according to him it should be easy to just determine a block size and then it should do all the work for you.) Well, so far no luck and I've tried some different approaches, but now I'm back to basics and trying again, this is my current code:
    public string[] GenerateKeysToStrings(string uniqueIdentifier)
    {
        string[] keys;
        using (var rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(4096))
        {
            try
            {
                string privateKey = rsa.ToXmlString(true);
                string publicKey = rsa.ToXmlString(false);

                this.pki.StoreKey(publicKey, uniqueIdentifier);

                keys = new string[2];
                keys[0] = privateKey;
                keys[1] = publicKey;
            }
            finally
            {
                //// Clear the RSA key container, deleting generated keys.
                rsa.PersistKeyInCsp = false;
            }
        }
        return keys;
    }

As you can see, I generate the keys and I mimmick a PKI by sending the public key to a simple class that stores it, and then the private key is written to a file
(Notice that I also have another method that does the same but stores it to an array instead, just because I wanted to test and simplify things as I get No such key exceptions and sometimes cryptographic exceptions when I do it the way shown in the example, so I wanted to simplify it by simply storing the rsa.ToXmlString string, as a string in an array, but no luck.)

    public string Encrypt(string keyString, string message)
    {
        string encryptedMessage;

                ASCIIEncoding byteConverter = new ASCIIEncoding();
                byte[] dataToEncrypt = byteConverter.GetBytes(message);

                byte[] encryptedData = rsa.Encrypt(dataToEncrypt, false);

                //// Convert the byte array back to a string message
                encryptedMessage = byteConverter.GetString(encryptedData);

","Okay, I've finally come up with a solution to the problem I stated in my original post. This is something I haven't thoroughly tested or anything, but something I figured out from a little trial and error process.

","Practical PKI-based encryption systems use asymmetric encryption to encrypt a symmetric key, and then symmetric encryption with that key to encrypt the data (having said that, someone will point out a counter-example).
So the additional overhead imposed by asymmetric crypto algorithms over that of symmetric is fixed - it doesn't depend on the data size, just on the key sizes.
Last time I tested this, validating a chain of 3 or so X.509 certificates [edit to add: and the data they were signing] was taking a fraction of a second on an ARM running at 100MHz or so (averaged over many repetitions, obviously). I can't remember how small - not negligible, but well under a second.
Sorry I can't remember the exact details, but the summary is that unless you're on a very restricted system or doing a lot of encryption (like if you want to accept as many as possible SSL connections a second), NIST-approved asymmetric encryption methods are fast.

","Yes, purely asymmetric encryption is much slower than symmetric cyphers (like DES or AES), which is why real applications use hybrid cryptography: the expensive public-key operations are performed only to encrypt (and exchange) an encryption key for the symmetric algorithm that is going to be used for encrypting the real message.
The problem that public-key cryptography solves is that there is no shared secret. With a symmetric encryption you have to trust all involved parties to keep the key secret. This issue should be a much bigger concern than performance (which can be mitigated with a hybrid approach)

","Perhaps you can add some details about your project so that you get better quality answers.  What are you trying to secure?  From whom?  If you could explain the requirements of your security, you'll get a much better answer.  Performance doesn't mean much if the encryption mechanism isn't protecting what you think it is.
For instance, X509 certs are an industrial standard way of securing client/server endpoints.  PGP armoring can be used to secure license files.  For simplicity, Cipher block chaining with Blowfish (and a host of other ciphers) is easy to use in Perl or Java, if you control both end points.

","On a Macbook running OS X 10.5.5 and a stock build of OpenSSL, ""openssl speed"" clocks AES-128-CBC at 46,000 1024 bit blocks per second. That same box clocks 1024 bit RSA at 169 signatures per second. AES-128-CBC is the ""textbook"" block encryption algorithm, and RSA 1024 is the ""textbook"" public key algorithm. It's apples-to-oranges, but the answer is: RSA is much, much slower.
That's not why you shouldn't be using public key encryption, however. Here's the real reasons:

Public key crypto operations aren't intended for raw data encryption. Algorithms like Diffie-Hellman and RSA were devised as a way of exchanging keys for block crypto algorithms. So, for instance, you'd use a secure random number generator to generate a 128 bit random key for AES, and encrypt those 16 bytes with RSA.
Algorithms like RSA are much less ""user-friendly"" than AES. With a random key, a plaintext block you feed to AES is going to come out random to anyone without the key. That is actually not the case with RSA, which is --- more so than AES --- just a math equation. So in addition to storing and managing keys properly, you have to be extremely careful with the way you format your RSA plaintext blocks, or you end up with vulnerabilities. 
Public key doesn't work without a key management infrastructure. If you don't have a scheme to verify public keys, attackers can substitute their own keypairs for the real ones to launch ""man in the middle"" attacks. This is why SSL forces you to go through the rigamarole of certificates. Block crypto algorithms like AES do suffer from this problem too, but without a PKI, AES is no less safe than RSA.
Public key crypto operations are susceptible to more implementation vulnerabilities than AES. For example, both sides of an RSA transaction have to agree on parameters, which are numbers fed to the RSA equation. There are evil values attackers can substitute in to silently disable encryption. The same goes for Diffie Hellman and even more so for Elliptic Curve. Another example is the RSA Signature Forgery vulnerability that occurred 2 years ago in multiple high-end SSL implementations.
Using public key is evidence that you're doing something ""out of the ordinary"". Out of the ordinary is exactly what you never want to be with cryptography; beyond just the algorithms, crypto designs are audited and tested for years before they're considered safe. 

To our clients who want to use cryptography in their applications, we make two recommendations:

For ""data at rest"", use PGP. Really! PGP has been beat up for more than a decade and is considered safe from dumb implementation mistakes. There are open source and commercial variants of it.
For ""data in flight"", use TLS/SSL. No security protocol in the world is better understood and better tested than TLS; financial institutions everywhere accept it as a secure method to move the most sensitive data.

Here's a decent writeup [matasano.com] me and Nate Lawson, a professional cryptographer, wrote up a few years back. It covers these points in more detail.

","Yes, the hybrid encryption offered by standardized cryptographic schemes like PGP, TLS, and CMS does impose a fixed performance cost on each message or session. How big that impact is depends on the algorithms selected and which operation you are talking about.
For RSA, decryption and signing operations are relatively slow, because it requires modular exponentiation with a large private exponent. RSA encryption and signature verification, on the other hand, is very fast, because it uses the small public exponent. This difference scales quadratically with the key length.
Under ECC, because peers are doing the same math with keys of similar size, operations are more balanced than RSA. In an integrated encryption scheme, an ephemeral EC key can be generated, and used in a key agreement algorithm; that requires a little extra work for the message sender. ECDH key agreement is much, much slower than RSA encryption, but much faster than RSA decryption.
In terms of relative numbers, decrypting with AES might be 100,000x faster than decrypting with RSA. In terms of absolute numbers, depending heavily on hardware, AES might take a few nanoseconds per block, while RSA takes a millisecond or two. And that prompts the question, why would anyone use asymmetric algorithms, ever?
The answer is that these algorithms are used together, for different purposes, in hybrid encryption schemes. Fast, symmetric algorithms like AES are used to protect the message itself, and slow, asymmetric algorithms like RSA are used in turn to protect the keys needed by the symmetric algorithms. This is what allows parties that have never previously shared any secret information, like you and your search engine, to communicate securely with each other.

","The reason why you need encryption at all is probably to protect against a man-in-the-middle. There are scenarios where an attacker is able to sniff at the traffic without being able to change it. This solution would protect against that threat, but it would provide no protection at all against a man-in-the-middle that is able to modify the traffic. 
If the attacker can change the traffic, then he will also be able to change the script that does the encryption. The easiest attack would be to just remove the encryption completely from the script. If you don't have https, and a man-in-the-middle is possible (which is the case in almost every scenario) then you don't have any control at all over the html or javascript that is presented to the end user. The attacker may rewrite your html code and javascript completely, disablign encryption, creating new form fields in your form etc.  Https is a prerequisite for secure communication in the web-channel.

","I've done it. I use this JavaScript client-side asymetric RSA encryption to prevent the login credentials to be send in plain text over HTTP.
The goal is to prevent login request replay attacks based on network sniffing. Of course, this is not as secure as HTTPS since it would not resist to man-in-the-middle attacks, but it can be sufficient for local networks.
The client-side encryption uses Travis Tridwell's excellent work which is based on JSBN. Travis' web page can also generate the private and public RSA keys (if you are too lazy to use openssl). The keys are generated in PKCS#1 PEM format. I encrypt username+password+timeInMs+timezone so that the encrypted content changes at each login.
On the server-side, my Java code read read the PKCS#1 PEM file using Apache JMeter's org.apache.jmeter.protocol.oauth.sampler.PrivateKeyReader :
PrivateKey pk = (new PrivateKeyReader(""myPrivateKeyFile.pem"")).getPrivateKey();

Then I decrypt the encrypted content using 
byte[] enc = DatatypeConverter.parseBase64Binary(clientData);
Cipher rsa = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");
rsa.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, pk);
byte[] dec = rsa.doFinal(enc);
String out = new String(dec, ""UTF8"");

Then I check if the client-side timestamp/timezone match the server-side timestamp/timezone. If the delay is less than a few seconds, the login process continues. Otherwise the request is considered a replay attack and the login fails.

","asymmetric public key/ private key is the only way to do this. To protect against MIM attacks the server can hash the public key with the users password, then the user (in the browser) re-computes the hash - if they match then the user can be confident that the public key sent from the server has not been tampered with - this relies on the fact that only the server and the user know the users password.

var error: Unmanaged<CFErrorRef>?

Where pubKey is a string representation of your public key.
If you don't know your public key, you can infer it from your private key with the following command:
openssl rsa -in server.key -pubout  > mykey.pub

Where server.key is the file containing -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
as the first line.
For iOS:
It's a bit more complicate.
You need a der file. It's a binary representation of your certificate.
If you need to convert an existing certificate, you can do so with the following command:
 openssl x509 -outform der -in file.crt|pem -out mycert.der

The .crt or .pem file contains -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- as the first line.
Put the der file in your bundle and do:

","You could try using this:
Stanford Javascript Crypto Library: http://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/

SJCL is secure. It uses the industry-standard AES algorithm at 128, 192 or 256 bits; the SHA256 hash function; the HMAC authentication code; the PBKDF2 password strengthener; and the CCM and OCB authenticated-encryption modes. 

Check the API here: http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/doc/
Stanford also has a page showing RSA (among others) encryption in Javascript: http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/

RSA and ECC in JavaScript:
The jsbn library is a fast, portable implementation of large-number math in pure JavaScript, enabling public-key crypto and other applications on desktop and mobile browsers. 

They also state it is 100% interoperable with openssl and have instructions on how you can confirm this.
You could also try CryptoJS: https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/

CryptoJS is a growing collection of standard and secure cryptographic algorithms implemented in JavaScript using best practices and patterns. They are fast, and they have a consistent and simple interface.

","You must use ENCRYPT('pass','salt') to force a salt, otherwise the salt is lost forever and you have no way of recovering it. Fairly pointless function without it. It's a terrible function to use, though, because the security is so minimal; use PASSWORD() or OLD_PASSWORD() instead.
ENCRYPT() uses the system crypt(), which may use all or only the first 8 characters, must be printable 7-bit ascii, generally uses 1 round of a DES-based hash, and is completely unportable. Avoid it.

","I'm not entirely sure what you are getting at. I am going to assume you want to know why you should use different keys for https/ssl/ssh and code signing (other than that they have different usage bits).
SSL certificates have to hang out around web servers, which are infamous for being compromised. Code signing certificates can be hidden away completely offline. In theory. In practice web servers are managed by professional sysadmins, and code signing certs are left lying around on bodge-a-job developer PCs. Also there's the Principle of Least Privilege.

","The reason for using separate key pairs for signing and encryption is to spread the risk: If someone recovers the private encryption key, he/she can decrypt documents that were encrypted using the public encryption key but can’t use it to also sign documents and vice versa.
Another reason could be a legal reason:

In several countries, a digital signature has a status somewhat like that of a traditional pen and paper signature, like in the EU digital signature legislation. Generally, these provisions mean that anything digitally signed legally binds the signer of the document to the terms therein. For that reason, it is often thought best to use separate key pairs for encrypting and signing. Using the encryption key pair, a person can engage in an encrypted conversation (e.g., regarding a real estate transaction), but the encryption does not legally sign every message he sends. Only when both parties come to an agreement do they sign a contract with their signing keys, and only then are they legally bound by the terms of a specific document. After signing, the document can be sent over the encrypted link. If a signing key is lost or compromised, it can be revoked to mitigate any future transactions. If an encryption key is lost, a backup or key escrow should be utilized to continue viewing encrypted content. Signing keys should never be backed up or escrowed.

","Having separate signing and encryption key pairs allows a company to back up the encryption certificate in order to decrypt data if you leave the company and they find stuff encrypted with your key.
Typically, the company won't keep a backup copy of your signing certificate, since it would destroy the notion of a valid digital signature.  If the signing certificate is held by more than one party, then who really signed a message with it?
So, encryption key is held by the user and backed up by the company.  Signing key is only held by the user.

","Reasons for using separate keys for signing and encryption:

Useful in organization were encryption key needs to be backed or
kept in escrow in order to decrypt data once an employee/user of the
organization is no longer available. Unlike the encryption key the
signing key must never be used by anyone other then the
employee/user and does not and should not need to be kept in escrow.
Allows having different expiration times for signing an encryption
keys.
Given that the underlying mathematics is the same for encryption and
signing, only in reverse, if an attacker can convince/trick a key
holder to sign an unformatted encrypted message using the same key
then the attacker gets the original.

","I've made some progress on this. If I use the Net::SSH library, I can do this:
Net::SSH::KeyFactory.load_private_key 'keyfile', 'passphrase'

By reading the source code I have yet to figure out what the library does to OpenSSL's PKey::RSA.new to accomplish this... And then I go and test again, and sure enough, OpenSSL can open the private key just fine without Net::SSH... I've made so much tests that somehow I didn't test this correctly before.
But I still have the issue of creating an SSH compatible key pair... and maybe I'll go test again and have the answer :P ... nah, I'm not that interested in that part

The advantage of using symmetric encryption and only using public key cryptography for the (symmetric) key is performance: symmetric cryptography is computationally much less resource-intensive (trade-off: you have to keep the key secret -- and that's what the second, asymmetric step is for).
Breaking up the file adds management overhead (how can you be sure how many chunks there will be? that you have transmitted them all?) and doesn't add any security. On the contrary.

I know it is just PKCS#12 is just archaive file which stores keys.
","I don't know what is wrong with your code, but I have code that reads stuff from a key store. I read the file into a KeyStore instance and then access the key or entry as appropriate. Here are some of the relevant calls:
char[] password;
String alias;

keyStore.load(inputStream, password);
java.security.PrivateKey privateKey = (PrivateKey) keyStore.getKey(alias, password);
java.security.keystore.PrivateKeyEntry privateKeyEntry = (PrivateKeyEntry) keyStore.getEntry(alias, new KeyStore.PasswordProtection(password));

To find the alias of the entry you are interested in, I suggest using keytool (comes with JDK):
keytool -list -v -keystore keystore.pkcs12 -storetype pkcs12

You will be prompted for the keystore password and then get information like this:
Keystore type: PKCS12
Keystore provider: SunJSSE

Your keystore contains 1 entry

","First off, a so-called .pem file is not really a fixed specification or format. Several different kinds of distinct file formats are generally described as ""PEM"" files. When the SSLeay (now OpenSSL) project needed to produce a base64 encoded output file containing key information they borrowed formatting concepts from the old Privacy-Enhanced Mail RFCs 1421-1424 and they added the extension .pem to the end of these files. But such a file may contain public keys, private keys, certificate requests, certificates, certificate lists, and so on. Each is different. So if all you're told is to produce a .pem file you're going to have to guess what's really needed.
The easiest way to write such files is to use the Bouncycastle C# library. The package Org.BouncyCastle.OpenSsl contains a number of utilities including a PemWriter class that should help you.

string publicKeyStr = Crypto.ExportPublicKeyToX509PEM(_cryptoServiceProvider);

Then you can use
RSACryptoServiceProvider publicX509key = Crypto.DecodeX509PublicKey(publicKeyStr);
RSACryptoServiceProvider privateRSAkey = Crypto.DecodeRsaPrivateKey(privateKeyStr);

to restore saved keys back to RSACryptoServiceProvider.
So, if someone need to resolve similar issue, you can just download this library, go to Solution Explorer -> (Right click on your project) -> Add -> Reference -> Overview in your Visual Studio to add this library in your project, and add using CSharp_easy_RSA_PEM; where you need it :)

After a while I realized that if you run this snippet you will see that it correctly works:

from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP
import base64

def generate_keys():
    modulus_length = 1024

    key = RSA.generate(modulus_length)
    #print (key.exportKey())

    pub_key = key.publickey()
    #print (pub_key.exportKey())

    return key, pub_key

def encrypt_private_key(a_message, private_key):
    encryptor = PKCS1_OAEP.new(private_key)
    encrypted_msg = encryptor.encrypt(a_message)
    print(encrypted_msg)
    encoded_encrypted_msg = base64.b64encode(encrypted_msg)
    print(encoded_encrypted_msg)
    return encoded_encrypted_msg

def decrypt_public_key(encoded_encrypted_msg, public_key):
    encryptor = PKCS1_OAEP.new(public_key)
    decoded_encrypted_msg = base64.b64decode(encoded_encrypted_msg)
    print(decoded_encrypted_msg)
    decoded_decrypted_msg = encryptor.decrypt(decoded_encrypted_msg)
    print(decoded_decrypted_msg)
    #return decoded_decrypted_msg

def main():
  private, public = generate_keys()
  print (private)
  message = b'Hello world'
  encoded = encrypt_private_key(message, public)
  decrypt_public_key(encoded, private)

if __name__== ""__main__"":
  main()

but if you now change two of the final lines [i.e. the role of the keys] into:
    encoded = encrypt_private_key(message, private)
    decrypt_public_key(encoded, public)

and rerun the program you will get the TypeError: No private key
Let me quote from this great answer: 
""As it turns out, PyCrypto is only trying to prevent you from mistaking one for the other here, OpenSSL or Ruby OpenSSL allow you for example to do both: public_encrypt/public_decrypt and private_encrypt/private_decrypt
[...]
Additional things need to be taken care of to make the result usable in practice. And that's why there is a dedicated signature package in PyCrypto - this effectively does what you described, but also additionally takes care of the things I mentioned""

Final notes: 

the last prints have ascii because as stated here ""In case of base64 however, all characters are valid ASCII characters""
in this case we are using the same key - the private one - both for encrypting and decrypting, so yes: we would end up to be symmetric but...
but - as stated here - ""The public key is PUBLIC - it's something you would readily share and thus would be easily disseminated. There's no added value in that case compared to using a symmetric cipher and a shared key"" plus ""Conceptually, ""encrypting"" with the private key is more useful for signing a message whereas the ""decryption"" using the public key is used for verifying the message""
the same identical last principle is expressed in this answer - ""Typically [...] we say sign with the private key and verify with the public key""

"8480918","Java: How to create a RSA Public Key from the String","I have the byte array of the RSA Public Key. I found on the internet that I can create a real PublicKey object of it by using this code:
PublicKey publicKey = 
    KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"").generatePublic(new X509EncodedKeySpec(bytes));

But every time I run this code, I'm getting another result for the encrypted data using that key. I'm sure the data I want to encrypt is always the same, so does the byte array representing the key.
Is this normal?
Here is my code always producing another output:
byte[] keyBytes = Base64.decodeBase64(rsa_1024_public_key);
      // rsa_1024_public key is a constant String

Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");

PublicKey publicKey =
   KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"").generatePublic(new X509EncodedKeySpec(keyBytes));

c.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, publicKey);

return c.doFinal(password.getBytes());

This is probably a part of the asymmetric encryption algorithm?

","RSA is non-determinstic. 
You can make it deterministic by selecting a non-random padding mode; however, that will not be secure.

","Symmetric keys are only to be used in a peer-to-peer way so it would be pointless for the receiver to modify JWTs for which only he and the sender have a shared key (and he is the intended recipient).
Asymmetric key signatures (in JWTs as well as in general) are produced by the sender with the private key and verified by the receiver with the public key.

","With asymmetric JWTs(JWS) that are signed with a Private Key of the Sender, the Receiver of the Token is basically receiving the Payload(header/claims) that are in clear text other the being base64 encoded. This is why they need to be transmitted in a Secured Socket Layer(SSL) environment. To Validate the Received Signature, the Public Key is used by the Receiver to recompute the Signature of the received Payload. If the two Signatures, the Received Signature and the Computed Signature, don't match, then the Payload cant be trusted-- it is Invalid
Therefore, such an Asymmetric JWS would not be a good method to include a sensitive ""claim"" such as a Social Security Number because the content of the Payload is not encrypted. 
The include such sensitive data in a JWT the Json Web Token Encrypted JWE could be employed. In the JWE the entire Payload is encrypted.

","On the Java side, you need to use ""RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding"" as algorithm name. With the plain ""RSA"" name, Java does not add the PKCS#1 padding which the C# implementation expects, hence the ""bad data"".
The padding is a transformation of the input data (your encoded string) into a somewhat larger string which has the same length than the RSA modulus (128 bytes here). It is important for security and injects some randomness (the same input string will not yield the same encrypted string every time; but the decryption process removes that randomness and recovers the right string nonetheless).

"5488401","Deterministic RSA encryption in Java","This is my first question on this site, and I only have a basic mathematical understanding of RSA, so please bear with me! :)
I'm writing a Java web application for my final year project at university. It's a web-based implementation of ""Pret-a-voter"", a secure voting system, for those who have heard of it.
Essentially my problem is that I want to be able to give someone performing the role of an auditor:

a source byte array (the plaintext to be encrypted)
an RSA public key file
a ""destination"" byte array, which is the result of my own computation of the cipherdata given the plaintext and the public key

I then want the auditor to be able to perform encryption using the first two items, and be satisfied that the third is the result. I therefore need the encryption to be deterministic, i.e. generate the same cipherdata each time encryption with the same plaintext and public key are repeated.
(Note - I'm working with very small blocks of data in this project - there is no symmetric encryption involved at all... I'm aware this is an ""interesting"" use of RSA!)
Anyway I found that in Java, using
cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");

uses the default random padding scheme, at a cost of 11 bytes (so with a 2048-bit key pair, it's possible to encrypt 2048/8-11 = 245 bytes). Repeated encryptions of the same plaintext generate different ciphertexts, which is obviously not the ECB mode that I want.
My question is - should I use the following?
cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/ECB/NoPadding"");

I've read in lots of places that RSA is insecure without padding. Is that simply because an attacker can build a dictionary of plaintexts/ciphertexts? This is a side-effect of the deterministic encryption I require in order to allow auditors to verify my encryption, and in my scheme auditors are trusted, so that would be OK.
Part two of my question is more java-related. If I do use RSA/ECB/NoPadding as above, I believe I'm able to provide a source byte array of (say) length 128 (for a 1024-bit RSA key pair) and encrypt that to get another byte array of length 128. If I then try to encrypt that again, with a different 1024-length public key, I get

javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Message is larger than modulus

Does anyone know why?
EDIT - encryption with NoPadding doesn't always generate this exception - it's temperamental. However, even when encryption does not generate this exception, decryption generates this:

javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Data must start with zero

Many thanks for reading through this! Any help would be greatly appreciated.
EDIT - sorry, my original question wasn't very clear about what it is I want to do, so here's an [attempt at an] explanation:

The plaintext is a voter's vote in an election.
Pret-a-voter aims to be end-to-end verifiable without sacrificing voter confidentiality (etc). After voting, the voter is provided with a receipt that they can use to verify that their vote has been recorded correctly, and which will later show them that their vote has not been tampered with. The voter performs a comparison of the information on their receipt with an identical copy posted on the web.
However, it should not be possible for any voter to prove how he/she voted (as that could lead to coercion) so the information is not the plaintext, but an encrypted copy of the vote.
In fact, the plaintext is encrypted four times, with four different asymmetric keys - held by two different tellers, each holding two of the keys. So, a vote (plaintext) is provided to one teller, who encrypts it using public key #1, and then encrypts THAT ciphertext with his second public key, gives THAT ciphertext to the second teller who encrypts it with his two keys in the same way. The resulting ciphertext (result of four sequential encryptions) is what is posted to the web (made public). The tellers are trusted.
Each encrypted vote can be visualised as an ""onion"" where the centre is the vote and there are several layers of encryption. In order to get to the vote, each layer must be removed in turn, meaning the corresponding private keys (held by the tellers) must be applied in the reverse sequence. This is key to the security - all tellers must work cooperatively in order to decrypt the votes.
The web bulletin board can be visualised as a table with 5 columns - the first (on the left) holds the fully-encrypted votes (also shown on each voter's receipt), and is the only visible column during the vote-casting stage. The second column contains the same set of votes, but with the outer layer removed - teller 2 populates this column and column 3 by decrypting the votes using its private keys during the tallying stage. At the end of the tallying stage, column 5 contains the fully-decrypted votes that can then be tallied.
Each voter gets a receipt that links them to an encrypted vote in column 1. This doesn't show how they voted, but allows them to verify that their vote has not been tampered with as throughout the election process they can verify that their encrypted vote is still there in column 1, untouched. This is only half of the ""end-to-end verification"", of course, since voters are unable to verify that the decryptions have been done correctly, i.e. that there's an entry in column 2 which is their vote minus the outer layer of encryption. Each voter is responsible only for the verification UP TO the point of column 1.
Thereafter, it is the auditors' responsibility to check that the entries in column 1 decrypt to column 2, and so on. The way they do this is by relying on deterministic encryption and the public keys used for the encryption being public.
Since public keys are public, you don't want people to simply draw lines from column 5 to column 1, joining up someone's vote as it becomes repeatedly encrypted - that way, a receipt that ties you to an encrypted vote actually ties you to an unencrypted, readable vote --> coercion! So, only columns 1, 3 and 5 are public (this is why each teller performs TWO encryptions), and for each entry in column 3, only ONE of the corresponding entries in {2,4} are revealed to auditors. This prevents anyone (even auditors) from linking an encrypted vote to an unencrypted vote.
Auditors therefore need to take an entry in column 3, be given the corresponding entry in column 2 and the public key, and perform the same encryption to verify that they do indeed get the entry in column 2.
Put together, this offers end-to-end verifiability.

Sorry that was so lengthy - I hope it describes my need for deterministic encryptions. I've missed out a lot of fundamental details (I've modified this scheme heavily) but hopefully the core principles are all there. Thank you so much for reading - I really appreciate it.
","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Padding
The padding is there precisely to avoid a given plain text being encrypted to a single cyphertext. So if you want a deterministic (single) result for any given plain text your only option is to turn it off.

","So it seems to me that you have 2 main requirements that you are attempting to use deterministic RSA to solve:

Allowing voters to ensure the integrity of their vote
Allowing auditors to ensure the integrity of all votes

Digital Signatures should solve this problem.  You can take your ciphertext from column 1, hash it, and encrypt the hash with a private key.  That encrypted hash can then be placed in column 2.  To verify the integrity of column 1, simply use the corresponding public key to decrypt the hash in column 2, hash column 1, and compare those 2 values.  If they are equal, the data has not been tampered with.  Only parties that have the private key could possibly tamper with the data in these columns, because only they can make a matching pair.  This is similar to an HMAC, but has the advantage of using public/private keys rather than a secret shared key.  Thus anybody can verify, but only trusted parties can modify.
One thing to note about deterministic schema is that it will leak information in many ways.  Let's assume that I know I voted for Blue as my favorite color.  I can see that the resulting ciphertext of my vote is 0x12345678.  If the schema is completely deterministic, I know that anybody else that has a corresponding ciphertext of 0x12345678 also voted for Blue.  Also, since you will typically have a finite set of vote choices, a chosen plaintext attack is incredibly easy.  Thus you really want to let RSA do its job and use the intended padding scheme.
The next thing you may want to consider is protecting the system from a form of Replay Attack by numbering the votes or something like that.  As I understand your schema, it looks like if I somehow got access to where you store your votes (or got in the middle of any communication), I could essentially spoof or spam fake votes just by replaying or copying data that I've already seen (another problem with being deterministic).

"5488401","Deterministic RSA encryption in Java","This is my first question on this site, and I only have a basic mathematical understanding of RSA, so please bear with me! :)
I'm writing a Java web application for my final year project at university. It's a web-based implementation of ""Pret-a-voter"", a secure voting system, for those who have heard of it.
Essentially my problem is that I want to be able to give someone performing the role of an auditor:

a source byte array (the plaintext to be encrypted)
an RSA public key file
a ""destination"" byte array, which is the result of my own computation of the cipherdata given the plaintext and the public key

I then want the auditor to be able to perform encryption using the first two items, and be satisfied that the third is the result. I therefore need the encryption to be deterministic, i.e. generate the same cipherdata each time encryption with the same plaintext and public key are repeated.
(Note - I'm working with very small blocks of data in this project - there is no symmetric encryption involved at all... I'm aware this is an ""interesting"" use of RSA!)
Anyway I found that in Java, using
cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");

uses the default random padding scheme, at a cost of 11 bytes (so with a 2048-bit key pair, it's possible to encrypt 2048/8-11 = 245 bytes). Repeated encryptions of the same plaintext generate different ciphertexts, which is obviously not the ECB mode that I want.
My question is - should I use the following?
cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/ECB/NoPadding"");

I've read in lots of places that RSA is insecure without padding. Is that simply because an attacker can build a dictionary of plaintexts/ciphertexts? This is a side-effect of the deterministic encryption I require in order to allow auditors to verify my encryption, and in my scheme auditors are trusted, so that would be OK.
Part two of my question is more java-related. If I do use RSA/ECB/NoPadding as above, I believe I'm able to provide a source byte array of (say) length 128 (for a 1024-bit RSA key pair) and encrypt that to get another byte array of length 128. If I then try to encrypt that again, with a different 1024-length public key, I get

javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Message is larger than modulus

Does anyone know why?
EDIT - encryption with NoPadding doesn't always generate this exception - it's temperamental. However, even when encryption does not generate this exception, decryption generates this:

javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Data must start with zero

Many thanks for reading through this! Any help would be greatly appreciated.
EDIT - sorry, my original question wasn't very clear about what it is I want to do, so here's an [attempt at an] explanation:

The plaintext is a voter's vote in an election.
Pret-a-voter aims to be end-to-end verifiable without sacrificing voter confidentiality (etc). After voting, the voter is provided with a receipt that they can use to verify that their vote has been recorded correctly, and which will later show them that their vote has not been tampered with. The voter performs a comparison of the information on their receipt with an identical copy posted on the web.
However, it should not be possible for any voter to prove how he/she voted (as that could lead to coercion) so the information is not the plaintext, but an encrypted copy of the vote.
In fact, the plaintext is encrypted four times, with four different asymmetric keys - held by two different tellers, each holding two of the keys. So, a vote (plaintext) is provided to one teller, who encrypts it using public key #1, and then encrypts THAT ciphertext with his second public key, gives THAT ciphertext to the second teller who encrypts it with his two keys in the same way. The resulting ciphertext (result of four sequential encryptions) is what is posted to the web (made public). The tellers are trusted.
Each encrypted vote can be visualised as an ""onion"" where the centre is the vote and there are several layers of encryption. In order to get to the vote, each layer must be removed in turn, meaning the corresponding private keys (held by the tellers) must be applied in the reverse sequence. This is key to the security - all tellers must work cooperatively in order to decrypt the votes.
The web bulletin board can be visualised as a table with 5 columns - the first (on the left) holds the fully-encrypted votes (also shown on each voter's receipt), and is the only visible column during the vote-casting stage. The second column contains the same set of votes, but with the outer layer removed - teller 2 populates this column and column 3 by decrypting the votes using its private keys during the tallying stage. At the end of the tallying stage, column 5 contains the fully-decrypted votes that can then be tallied.
Each voter gets a receipt that links them to an encrypted vote in column 1. This doesn't show how they voted, but allows them to verify that their vote has not been tampered with as throughout the election process they can verify that their encrypted vote is still there in column 1, untouched. This is only half of the ""end-to-end verification"", of course, since voters are unable to verify that the decryptions have been done correctly, i.e. that there's an entry in column 2 which is their vote minus the outer layer of encryption. Each voter is responsible only for the verification UP TO the point of column 1.
Thereafter, it is the auditors' responsibility to check that the entries in column 1 decrypt to column 2, and so on. The way they do this is by relying on deterministic encryption and the public keys used for the encryption being public.
Since public keys are public, you don't want people to simply draw lines from column 5 to column 1, joining up someone's vote as it becomes repeatedly encrypted - that way, a receipt that ties you to an encrypted vote actually ties you to an unencrypted, readable vote --> coercion! So, only columns 1, 3 and 5 are public (this is why each teller performs TWO encryptions), and for each entry in column 3, only ONE of the corresponding entries in {2,4} are revealed to auditors. This prevents anyone (even auditors) from linking an encrypted vote to an unencrypted vote.
Auditors therefore need to take an entry in column 3, be given the corresponding entry in column 2 and the public key, and perform the same encryption to verify that they do indeed get the entry in column 2.
Put together, this offers end-to-end verifiability.

Sorry that was so lengthy - I hope it describes my need for deterministic encryptions. I've missed out a lot of fundamental details (I've modified this scheme heavily) but hopefully the core principles are all there. Thank you so much for reading - I really appreciate it.
","Removing the padding makes the system insecure.  If the public keys are indeed public, as you say, then an attacker can simply go to column 5, take the plaintexts, and encrypt them with the 4 public keys in the proper sequence.  They can then match up the resulting ciphertexts with that from the reciepts, compromising the ""no coercion"" property.
Random padding stops this, because the attacker doesn't know what padding to add.
You will need to use normal padding, but reveal a subset of the private keys to a subset of the auditors (usually called ""scrutineers"" in electoral systems).  This means that one scrutineer can confirm that column 1 matches column 2, another can confirm that column 2 matches column 3, and so on.  An individual scrutineer can't match a voter to a ballot, only co-operating ones.

The reason that you're getting the ""Message is larger than modulus"" error is because each modulus is different, so the ciphertext from one encryption may be outside the allowable range for the next encryption.

","This is an old thread but in case others come across this, it seems there's a secure package by Hadley. The readme states: 
The secure package provides a secure vault within a publicly available code repository. It allows you to store private information in a public repository so that only select people can read it. This is particularly useful for testing because you can now store private credentials in your public repo, without them being readable by the world.
Secure is built on top of asymmetric (public/private key) encryption. Secure generates a random master key and uses that to encrypt (with AES256) each file in vault/. The master key is not stored unencrypted anywhere; instead, an encrypted copy is stored for each user, using their own public key. Each user can than decrypt the encrypted master key using their private key, then use that to decrypt each file.

Was that what you were expecting?  If it was then I suggest that you check each of the included pieces of Base64 for errors.  Alternatively, it may just be that your initial piece of Base64 is too long.

Apparently this Base64 string is invalid and the encryption fails.
Can anybody see where I am going wrong?
","Fixed! It appears the error was a little misleading (or likely I was being stupid!) and it looks like it was NOT the plain text for encryption that was the cause of the exception but the password/passphrase.  
I found another app I was using this method in and found the KEY was the problem. I was passing a plain text password in initially, then I changed this to a SHA-256 hash of the password when this was in fact not a valid key.
I added these two methods (the later of which I found on here):
            public static string AesKeyFromPassword(string password, int keySize = Keysize.SymmetricKeyLength)
        {
            byte[] passwordByteArray = CreateKey(password);

            var aesEncryption = new RijndaelManaged
            {
                KeySize = keySize,
                BlockSize = 128,
                Mode = CipherMode.CBC,
                Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7,
                Key = passwordByteArray
            };

            aesEncryption.GenerateIV();
            string ivStr = Convert.ToBase64String(aesEncryption.IV);
            string keyStr = Convert.ToBase64String(aesEncryption.Key);
            string completeKey = ivStr + "","" + keyStr;

            return Convert.ToBase64String(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(completeKey));
        }

        private static byte[] CreateKey(string password)
        {
            var salt = new byte[] { 1, 2, 23, 234, 37, 48, 134, 63, 248, 4 };

            const int Iterations = 9872;
            using (var rfc2898DeriveBytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, salt, Iterations))
                return rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes(32);
        }

This now takes the plain text password/phrase and generates a valid encryption key which I then use in the Encrypt method.
Thank for your help guys!  I can now securely store the Private Key! :)

","You can provide keystores to already existing implementations for data sending over http, which will fetch the keystore and perform all the necessary stuff so you don't have to.
For server-side authentication this would be a keystore = KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS""), containing all the trusted certificates.
For client-side authentication, if applicable (you need to verify yourself) also such implementation already exist
where you just provide your client 'keystore' => this one will contain your certificate and it's private key => KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS12"")
Then finally you want to store these stuff to database, here it gets a bit tricky.. Keystores are secured, so you can not just write it away.. you have to use the keystore.store(OutPutstream, password)..
What I find best is for instance:
@Entity
public class MyKeyStoreClass {
private Long id;
@Transient
private KeyStore keystore;
private String passwordForKeyStore;
private Byte[] keyStoreAsBytes;

@PreUpdate
@PrePersist
public void concertKeyStoreToBytes() {
   ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        keystore.store(byteArrayOutputStream,
                passwordForKeyStore.toCharArray());
   keyStoreAsBytes = byteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray();
}

@PostLoad
public void getKeyStore() {
   if (keystore == null && keyStoreAsBytes != null) {
      keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(getKeystoreType().getType());
      keyStore.load(new ByteArrayInputStream(keystoreAsBytes), passwordForKeyStore.toCharArray()); 
   }    
}

The above code is not 100% correct, but it gives you a good idea of what I mean, If you don't work with annotations, you can do it using another approach but I think my point is clear ;)

"20581169","Java Crypto Api - how to choose a cipher provider","In order to implement encryption using Java, I am using JCE, which is nice and fun.
I was told that it is better to choose the crypto provider than to use a default one.
I need to choose providers both for symmetric key generation. used by this code (using AES in CBC mode):
 Key sharedKey = (KeyGenerator.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING"", PROVIDER1).generateKey();

And for Asymmetric text encryption used by this code (using RSA in ECB mode):
Cipher rsaEncryptor = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding"",PROVIDER2); 

My question is how should I choose PROVIDER1 and PROVIDER2?
for example, I saw that ""SunJCE"" is a well documented provider, but I don't think it is a ""good enough"" reason to choose it.
anyone?
","In general, you should stick to the default provider, unless there is a compelling reason not to. Hard coding your provider has the serious drawback that your code won't allow you to change your provider without rewriting your code. The only reason I would see for choosing a provider directly is to make sure that some security constraints are met, that would not be present for other providers.
The following paragraph is directly from the Oracle documentation: 

Reminder: Cryptographic implementations in the JDK are distributed through several different providers (""Sun"", ""SunJSSE"", ""SunJCE"", ""SunRsaSign"") for both historical reasons and by the types of services provided. General purpose applications SHOULD NOT request cryptographic services from specific providers. That is:
getInstance(""..."", ""SunJCE"");  // not recommended
    vs.
getInstance(""..."");            // recommended



You can still manage to allow other providers to be used by giving them a higher priority (a lower priority indicator, 1 is highest priority) within the java.security file within the jre/lib/security path of your runtime. If you want to specify the provider using getInstance(""Algorithm"", ""Provider"") it might be a good idea to make the provider string configurable (e.g. using properties and using myConfig.getProperty(""Provider"")).

The C# code takes some string content, and a signature (generated using the private key, on a seperate machine) and combined with the public key it verifies the signature matches, providing a level of assurance that the request has not been tampered with.
  public bool VerifySignature(string content, byte[] signatureBytes, AsymmetricAlgorithm publicKey)

What I'm looking to do is emulate this functionality in Java, so I can verify the signature generated by some code in C#... I've started investigating the crypto functionality of Java, but I'm a bit of a java noob.  Here's what I've come up with so far:
byte[] certContents=null;
byte[] signature=null;

CertificateFactory factory = CertificateFactory.getInstance(""X.509"");
X509Certificate cert = (X509Certificate) factory.generateCertificate(new ByteArrayInputStream(certContents));

// grab public key
RSAPublicKey publicKey = (RSAPublicKey)cert.getPublicKey();

// get sha1 hash for contents        
Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA1"");
mac.update(contents.getBytes());                
byte[] hash = mac.doFinal();

// get cipher
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");
cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, publicKey);

// verify signature of contents matches signature passed to method somehow (and this is where I'm stuck)

Can anyone provide any insight into how I can verify the signature - or provide links to some resources which might explain the java.crypto and java.security.cert usage better then the run of the mill java docs.
","That C# code looks really confusing to me. It use SHA1CryptoServiceProvider but uses MD5 hash so I can't tell which hashing algorithm it's using. I assume it's MD5.
The signature verification process involves padding so your code wouldn't work. Following is some snippet from my code and you can use it to verify the signature. data is the bytes to sign and sigBytes holds the signature.
String algorithm = ""MD5withRSA"";

// Initialize JCE provider    
Signature verifier = Signature.getInstance(algorithm);

// Do the verification   
boolean result=false;

try {
    verifier.initVerify(cert); // This one checks key usage in the cert

I am using the same public key, private key pair on both machines, can correctly encrypt/decrypt data on the Android phone, can correctly encrypt/decrypt data on the Linux server, but I am unable to encrypt data on the phone and then decrypt it on the server. I get bad padding exceptions. I have confirmed that the data is being sent correctly by the phone and is being parsed correctly by the server. As such, I cannot figure out why decryption fails. Can anyone help me with this? Perhaps the RSA algorithm in Java has some underlying assumption about word size?
Further information:

My encryption/decryption library is based on the guide found here.
My encryption key is 2048 bits in length, but I see similar behaviour with different key sizes.
I have packaged my RSA encryption/decryption code into a jar file. It was compiled through Eclipse on the server's machine.
The program using the encryption library on the Android phone uses the above library. It too was built using Eclipse.
The server program was built using Netbeans (as it was easier at the time to do so).

Other Questions

Are there other free public-key encryption algorithms / libraries available for Java? Do they work cross-platform? What performance would one expect from them? Etc., etc. I've looked into this and haven't found much; perhaps I'm looking with the wrong keywords.

Phew! I think that's it. Thanks for your help in  advance!

My encryption/decryption library is based on the guide found here.
My encryption key is 2048 bits in length, but I see similar behaviour with different key sizes.
I have packaged my RSA encryption/decryption code into a jar file. It was compiled through Eclipse on the server's machine.
The program using the encryption library on the Android phone uses the above library. It too was built using Eclipse.
The server program was built using Netbeans (as it was easier at the time to do so).

Other Questions

Are there other free public-key encryption algorithms / libraries available for Java? Do they work cross-platform? What performance would one expect from them? Etc., etc. I've looked into this and haven't found much; perhaps I'm looking with the wrong keywords.

Phew! I think that's it. Thanks for your help in  advance!
","RSA encryption (or any encryption algorithm) should work regardless of environment.  However, it is possible that certain systems make different assumptions about default padding and the mode of operation.  Make sure that when you are performing encryption and decryption that you fully specify not only the algorithm, but also the mode of operation (CBC, etc) and the padding.  If that doesn't work, I suggest posting your code from both the device and the server so we can examine it more closely.
Edit To address your question, in Java, when you get a cipher from the crypto package, you usually do so with the following code:
Cipher cipher;
cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");

The string provided to getInstance instructs the runtime to get a cipher instance that will use the AES algorithm, the cipher block chaining mode of operation and the PKCS5 Padding.  There are a number of supported algorithms and paddings.  I would check out this document from Oracle for more information about encryption in Java.
To be more specific, the string you use to request a cipher is in the format
<algorithm>/<mode of operation>/<padding>

To make matters worse, despite Java providing a number of algorithms, modes of operation and paddings, not all of them will work together.  You will need to read the documentation to find a configuration string that will work.

","You can't do that (it's a sort of know-plain-text attack). You can't derive any information on the key nor on the plain text, given an encrypted RSA message.

","Actually, if you use RSA properly, then you cannot even guess your 'XXX' by trying the 1000 possibilities. The core operation in RSA is a modular exponentiation, but there is a first step called padding which transforms the data to encrypt into a big integer (modulo n).
The PKCS#1 RSA standard specifies two types of padding; both include a bunch of random bytes. A consequence is the following: if you encrypt twice the same message with the same key, you will get two distinct encrypted messages. The point is, precisely, to avoid the situation which you allude to: being able to ""guess"" the encrypted message and verify whether the guess is right or not, with only the public key (which is public, hence assumed to be known by every attacker).
Therefore, to answer your question: if you can find your 'XXX', either by trying only 1000 RSA encryption, or through any kind of clever shortcut, then your RSA is very wrong.

","Standard encryption in Java is pretty straight forward.  I suggest checking out the reference guide for instructions on how to use the javax.crypto package.  However I would urge you to reconsider your design if it requires sensitive data, stored on client machines, that you don't trust the users with.  The reason I say that is in order for you program to access the information, it would need to have the encryption/decryption key stored internally which would mean that the key would be stored in the archive somewhere.  In the best case, it'd be stored as a variable in one of the class files.  Examining the binary classfile to determine this key would be trivial.  At the very least you should consider obfuscating your encryption code to at least make it slightly more difficult to identify the key simply from examining the binary code or decompiling the class file.

Consider you have   
var bytes = new byte[30] { /* ... */ };

and you want to use 2048bit RSA to ensure no one have changed anything in this array.
Normally, you would use digital signature (ie. RIPEMD160), which you then attach to the original bytes and send over to the receiver.
So, you have 30 bytes of original data, and additional 256 bytes of digital signature (because it is a 2048bit RSA), which is overall of 286 bytes. Hovewer, only 160 bits of that 256 bytes are actually hash, so there is exactly 1888 bits (236 bytes) unused.
So, my idea was this:  
Take the 30 bytes of original data, attach to it the hash (20 bytes), and now encrypt these 50 bytes. You get 256 bytes long message, which is much shorter than 286 bytes, because ""you were able to push the actual data inside the digital signature"".

","I get it now, after reading the comments.
The answer is: don't do it.
Cryptographic signature algorithms are not algorithms from which you can pick and choose - or modify - steps.  In particular, supposing a signature sig looks something like encrypt(hash), orig + sig is not the same as encrypt(orig + hash).  Further, even outdated signature algorithms like PKCS v1.5 are not as simple as encrypt(hash) in the first place.
A technique like the one you describe sacrifices security for the sake of cleverness.  If you don't have the bandwidth for a 256 byte signature, then you need one of:

a different algorithm,
more bandwidth, or
a smaller key.

And if you go with (1), please be sure it's not an algorithm you made up!  The simple fact is that crypto is hard.

","If you're at the point where the data is so small that the digital signature is huge in comparison, then you have excess signature.  The solution isn't to roll your own algorithm, but to cut down what's there.  You definitely don't want to try to combine a key with the hash in an amateurish way: this has been broken already, which is why we have HMAC's.
So here's the basic idea:

Create a session key using a cryptographically strong RNG.
Transmit it via PKE.
Use the session key to generate an HMAC-SHA1 (or HMAC-RIPEMD160, or whatever).
If the size of the hash is absurdly large for the given data, cut it in half by XORing the top with the bottom.  Repeat as needed.
Send the data and the (possibly cut-down) hash.
The receiver uses the data and the session key to regenerate the hash and then compares it with the one transmitted (possibly after first cutting it down.)
Change session keys often.

This is a compromise between the insanity of rolling your own system and using an ill-fitting one.
I'm wide open to constructive criticism...

Take the 30 bytes of original data, attach to it the hash (20 bytes), and now encrypt these 50 bytes. You get 256 bytes long message, which is much shorter than 286 bytes, because ""you were able to push the actual data inside the digital signature"".

Final Solution
If anyone is interested how I've solved this problem, I'm going to use 1024bit DSA and SHA1, which is widely supported on many different versions of Windows (Windows 2000 and newer), security is good enough (I'm not signing orders, I just need to ensure that some child can't crack the signature on his iPhone (:-D)), and the signature size is only 40 bytes long.
","What you are trying to design is known as a ""Signature scheme with message recovery"".
Designing a new signature scheme is hard. Designing a new signature scheme with message recovery is harder. I don't know all the details about your design, but there is a good chance that it is susceptible to a chosen message attack.
One proposal for signature schemes with message recovery is RSA PSS-R. But unfortunately, this proposal is covered with a patent.
The IEEE P1363 standarization group, once discussed the addition of signature schemes with message recovery. However, I'm not sure about the current state of this effort, but it might be worth checking out.

"7432556","Javascript asymmetric encryption and authentication","Some of the guys here are developing an application which incorporates some 'secure areas' accessible by logging in. In the past, the login form and subsequent 'secure' pages were all plain text transmitted over http, as it's an application that goes out for use on shared servers where there is little chance of being able to use SSL (think WordPress and the like). Most people just shrugged their shoulders as that's all they expected - it's hardly a national bank.
We are now thinking of writing the next version using a JavaScript front end, with the advantage of loading all the images & CSS once, then writing HTML into the DOM thereafter with extJS (or maybe jQuery). We'd like to encrypt user input at the client before being sent to the server, then decrypt server output at the browser before being rendered to HTML so as to introduce some sort of security for users. There are also gains to be had with reducing page loading times, as we're only sending gzipped JSON back and forth.
While playing around, we realised that the method we were looking at to encrypt the basic stuff also doubled up as an authentication mechanism for login in the first place.
For simplicity...:

The user connects to the login page over standard http, where the browser downloads the JavaScript package containing the hashing and encryption algorithms (SHA-256 and AES for example).
User enters username, password and secret into a login form.
The browser JavaScript sends a hash of username and password to the server via AJAX. The secret is only stored in JavaScript and is never sent across the internet.
The server looks up the hash and retrieves username and secret from the database.
The server sends a hash (same algorithm as the browser) of username and secret back to the browser.
The browser JavaScript creates a hash of username and secret and compares it to the hash sent back from the server.
If they are the same, the browser JavaScript encrypts response with secret and sends the message back to the server.
The server decrypts the message with secret to find the expected response and starts a new session.
Subsequent communications are encrypted and decrypted both ways with secret.

There seem to be a few advantages of this type of system, but are we right in thinking:

The user knows they are talking to their server if the server manages to create a hash of username and secret, proving the server knows and understands username and secret.
The server knows the user is genuine if they manage to encrypt response with secret, proving the user knows secret.
At no time is secret ever transmitted in plain text, or is it possible to determine secret from the hash.
A sniffer will only ever find out the 'secure' URL and detect compressed hashes and encryptions in the query string. If they send a request to to the URL that is malformed, no response is given. If they somehow manage to guess an appropriate request, they still have to be able to decrypt it.

It all seems quick enough as to be imperceptible to the user. Can anyone see through this, as we all just assumed we shouldn't be playing with JavaScript encryption!

","If you can provide a single SSL site to deliver your JavaScript securely (to avoid the attack mentioned above), then you can use the opensource Forge library to provide cross-domain TLS connections to your other sites after generating self-signed certificates for them. The Forge library also provides other basic crypto stuff if you opt to go in a different direction. Forge has an XMLHttpRequest wrapper that is nearly all JavaScript, with a small piece that leverages Flash's socket API to enable cross-domain communication.

"2653591","Decrypting “long” message encrypted with RSA java","Hi this is the same question, that was asked two years ago:
Java/JCE: Decrypting “long” message encrypted with RSA
I had a large byte array and rsa keypair, initiated by value 1024.
Using rsa encryption and the specified size of the key is strong requirement, I can't change it. So I can't use symmetric encryption with asymetric encryption symmetric key. I can't use any other keys. I had a byte array and need ciphered byte array to be returned. I wonder if there is any ready tool, that can manage with this problem? 
Sorry for such an amateurish question, but I really need a help.
","As stated, your question has a single answer, and that's ""no"". RSA encryption is an algorithm which encrypts messages up to a given size, which depends on the key size; with a 1024-bit RSA key, and RSA as the standard describes it, the maximum size is 117 bytes, no more. There is no way to encrypt a larger message with RSA alone, and that's a definite, mathematical certainty.
If you really need to process longer messages, then you necessarily have to add something else. In that case, please, please, do not try to do anything fancy of your own devising with some oh-so-clever splitting of data into small blocks and the like. That path leads to doom. You might produce something which appears to compile and run, but which will be invariably weak in some way, like almost every other home-made variation on cryptography. That's because security cannot be tested: it is not a case of ""works"" or ""does not work"".
The well-trodden path of asymmetric encryption goes thus:

You select a random sequence of bytes of some appropriate length, e.g. 128 bits (that's 16 bytes). Let's call it K.
You encrypt K with the RSA public key; this yields E.
You encrypt the message with K using a symmetric encryption algorithm (""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding""). Since this is a one-shot key, you can use an all-zeros IV. This yields a bunch of bytes, let's call it F.
The encrypted message is then the concatenation of E and F.

Decryption proceeds in the reverse order: the RSA private key is used to recover K from E, then K is used to decrypt F into the original message. The key K is never stored anywhere, and a new key K is generated every time (even if you encrypt the same message twice). That's important, do not change that unless you understand what you are doing (and if you do, then you already know that).
Given what you state about your problem, you have to do something else than ""just RSA"". The procedure I describe above is about the best ""something else"" that you could come up with, security-wise.
Assembling some cryptographic elements into such a protocol is a process fraught with pitfalls so you may have better luck using an already defined format and support library. Two common formats for asymmetric encryption are CMS and OpenPGP. A library which supports both and has good reputation is Bouncy Castle.

","There seems to be little (if any) reason to do any of this if you're going to use an SSL connection (though I'd prefer TLS).
If you decide to do it anyway, the biggest pitfall with PK cryptography is a MITM attack -- i.e., you don't want to just accept the server's key and encrypt data with it. That will ensure that only the server can read the data, but if you haven't verified the identity of the server, you could be sending it to somebody else entirely. This is most of why 1) SSL/TLS connections are slow to set up, and 2) SSL/TLS libraries are big and complicated. Encryption is much easier than authentication.
There's no more reason to do this yourself than to do encryption yourself though -- SSL/TLS already do both authentication and encryption.

What you are describing is doable if the amount of data is not very large.  Remember, you can't keep the users waiting for your JavaScript to chug along.
RSA4096 is ridiculously huge, by the way.  2048 is high-grade at the moment and 3000-whatever is supposed to be good for 30+ years.  But, more power to ya.  A normal way to get around the public-key expense is to encrypt a symmetric (DSA) key using RSA - that way your encryption of the actual data is fast and the only slow part is decrypting the (shorter) key.  Asymmetric-key encryption is much slower than symmetric.
Whatever you decide to implement, make sure you get the encryption right in the JS code.
You should also note that this isn't really a way to protect the users from you; you control the web server, so you could send the users doctored JavaScript that delivers their private data to you with a key you control.  The users would be unlikely to notice.

","How about MD5?
Yes I am aware that MD5 has been 'broken; - but most practical applications this is irrelevant.
Especially if the modified data would also have to be valid in the particular data format as well as have the correct MD5
EDIT:
MD5 is appropriate if you want to just ensure that data stored can't be changed (or at least you can detect it) but it doesn't hide the data. Note that if you must have the key in your app alongside the data it can always be extracted. There are techniques for hiding the key - a popular one is simply to put it inside a static resource such as an icon that can be linked easily.

","Okay, I've found what I've been looking for, and I think it is better than OpenSSL (for my purposes, at least).
There are two libraries:
libtomcrypt, which implements several cyphers (including RSA), and libtommath, that implements bignum arithmetics. Both libraries are in public domain, easy to hack/modify and have simpler programming interface than OpenSSL, and (much) better documentation than OpenSSL.
Unlike older public domain rsa code I found before, libtomcrypt can generate new keys very quickly, can import OpenSSL-generated keys, and supports padding. Another good thing about libtomcrypt is that it doesn't have extra dependencies (OpenSSL for windows wants gdi32, for example) and is smaller than OpenSSL.
I've decided to use RSA for encryption, after all, because (to me it looks like) there are no truly asymmetric alternatives. It looks like most of the other ciphers (elgamal, elliptic curves) are more suitable for symmetric encryption where session key is being encrypted asymmetrically. Which isn't suitable for me. Such ciphers are suitable for network communications/session keys, but it wouldn't be good to use that for static unchanging data on disk.
As for ""RSA being slow"", I've changed archive format a bit, so now only small chunk of data is being asymmetrically encrypted. Failure to decrypt this chunk will make reading archive index completely very difficult if not impossible. Also, I must admit that slowness of RSA was partially a wrong impression given by older code I've tried to use before. 
Which means, question solved. Solution is RSA + libtomcrypt. RSA - because there aren't many alternatives to RSA, and libtomcrypt - because it is small and in public domain.

"29257451","Sign and encrypt a file using S/MIME","I am currently trying to adapt a few scripts we use to sign an encrypt/decrypt xml files using OpenSSL and S/MIME using Java and BouncyCastle.
The command to sign and encrypt our file:
openssl smime -sign -signer Pub1.crt -inkey Priv.key -in foo.xml | openssl smime -encrypt -out foo.xml.smime Pub2.crt Pub1.crt

This generates a signed and encrypted smime-file containing our xml file. Currently this happens using a set of shell scripts under linux using the OpenSSL library. In the future we want to integrate this process into our Java application. 
I've found out that this should be possible using the BouncyCastle library   (see this post). The answer there provides two Java classes showing how to sign and encrypt an email using BouncyCastle and S/MIME. Comparing this to our OpenSSL command it seems that many of the things needed to sign an encrypt an email is not needed in our approach.
Some more meta information from our generated files:
Signed file
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/signed; protocol=""application/x-pkcs7-signature""; micalg=""sha-256""; boundary=""----709621D94E0377688356FAAE5A2C1321""

I haven't made any changes to the application, I haven't touched the keys, so I can't quite understand why an issue has come up out of the blue. Any ideas? I can also manually decrypt the files using Kleopatra using the same keys that I load in the application.
Update 1 - I downloaded the free trial for OpenPGP Library for .NET, which looks to use BouncyCastle also, and I have no issues decrypting the files using the same key. For some reason, my implementation of decryption using BouncyCastle that has worked for several months stopped working for some reason that I have not been able to identify yet.
Update 2 - I pulled files from last week that worked, and I've also downloaded the source code of BouncyCastle in order that I can step through and debug to see where the exception is throwing and how the variables differ between a file that works and a file that doesn't work. The exception is being thrown at the beginning of the GetDataStream method of the PgpPublicKeyEncryptedData class:
byte[] plain = fetchSymmetricKeyData(privKey);

When I step into this method, for files that I can decrypt without any problem, I've noticed that the keyData.Algorithm variable is set to ""ElGamalEncrypt"", whereas for files that the exception throws, the file keyData.Algortithm is set to ""RsaGeneral"". Why would these differ? Did the company sending me the files change their encryption method? And is this encryption method not properly supported by BouncyCastle?

Also, not sure if this is related, the certificate type of our key is DSA.

Update 3 - I've been unable to figure out how to resolve the issue as of yet given the current keys. I generated new keys (type DSA) yesterday, and with the new keys the issue has been resolved.
Update 4 - This issue has just come up again, with the new key that worked in my last update.

Update 1 - I downloaded the free trial for OpenPGP Library for .NET, which looks to use BouncyCastle also, and I have no issues decrypting the files using the same key. For some reason, my implementation of decryption using BouncyCastle that has worked for several months stopped working for some reason that I have not been able to identify yet.
Update 2 - I pulled files from last week that worked, and I've also downloaded the source code of BouncyCastle in order that I can step through and debug to see where the exception is throwing and how the variables differ between a file that works and a file that doesn't work. The exception is being thrown at the beginning of the GetDataStream method of the PgpPublicKeyEncryptedData class:
byte[] plain = fetchSymmetricKeyData(privKey);

When I step into this method, for files that I can decrypt without any problem, I've noticed that the keyData.Algorithm variable is set to ""ElGamalEncrypt"", whereas for files that the exception throws, the file keyData.Algortithm is set to ""RsaGeneral"". Why would these differ? Did the company sending me the files change their encryption method? And is this encryption method not properly supported by BouncyCastle?
private byte[] fetchSymmetricKeyData(PgpPrivateKey privKey)
{
    IBufferedCipher c1 = GetKeyCipher(keyData.Algorithm);

    try
    {
        c1.Init(false, privKey.Key);
    }
    catch (InvalidKeyException e)
    {
        throw new PgpException(""error setting asymmetric cipher"", e);
    }

Also, not sure if this is related, the certificate type of our key is DSA.

Update 3 - I've been unable to figure out how to resolve the issue as of yet given the current keys. I generated new keys (type DSA) yesterday, and with the new keys the issue has been resolved.
Update 4 - This issue has just come up again, with the new key that worked in my last update. Once again, the keyData.Algorithm within the PgpPublicKeyEncryptedData class is being see to ""RsaGeneral"" instead of ""ElGamalEncrypt"" now. Why would the Algorithm property change? Is the person encrypting the file changing something?
","Looks like another party is encrypting to other/different keys.
Probably your keyring contains RSA key as well, but BouncyCastle uses only the first (???).
Using gpg, you can check the contents of your encrypted file by issuing 
gpg --list-packets YourEncryptedFile.pgp
After that apply the same command to 'good' file, and to your keyrings, and compare key identifiers to which file is encrypted.
Since you are using DSA keys, file should be encrypted to ElGamal subkey.

","I haven't used that plugin, but it's from 2009, so it's pretty old now. I wouldn't put too much faith in it.
It's easy to decrypt/encrypt using Cake's Security::rijndael, without using a plugin (note that the mcrypt php extension will need to be installed - but it may well be installed already).
First, in your model, add an array of the fields you want encrypted:
public $encryptedFields = array('mobile', 'body');

Then, implement a beforeSave like this:
public function beforeSave($options = array()) {
    foreach($this->encryptedFields as $fieldName){
        if(!empty($this->data[$this->alias][$fieldName])){
            $this->data[$this->alias][$fieldName] = Security::rijndael($this->data[$this->alias][$fieldName], Configure::read('Security.key'), 'encrypt');
        }
    }
    return true;
}

Your afterFind method should be pretty much the same, except it should decrypt rather than encrypt:
public function afterFind($results = array()) {
    foreach($this->encryptedFields as $fieldName){
        if(!empty($results[$this->alias][$fieldName])){
            $results[$this->alias][$fieldName] = Security::rijndael($results[$this->alias][$fieldName], Configure::read('Security.key'), 'decrypt');
        }
    }
    return $results;
}

Note I haven't tested all of that code - it's hacked together from bits and pieces in one of my own apps. But it should put you on the right track.

My users log in using Forms Authentication but the actions they request are run on the server using the AppPool account so when they go in the audit logs they're recorded against the AppPool account.  PCI DSS regulations now require that the user's own ID is in the audit logs which means the action must be taken using the user's creds.  Now, I can save the user's creds when they log on and submit them with each request and the actions being taken by the server can use those creds.  But the PCI regs say that if creds are saved they must be encrypted (to avoid someone taking a memory dump of the PC and getting the password).
The only way I can see of doing this is to get a public key from the server and encrypt the password with it, then submit the encrypted password and decrypt it on the server using the private key.  But Silverlight doesn't have asymmetric cryptography.
I guess I'm too close to the problem and there must be another solution but I can't see what it is.  Can anyone help?
CLARIFICATIONS
It's an internal application.  Up until now, I've been using IIS Forms AuthN over SSL to Active Directory - I'm not worried about protecting the password in transit, just whilst it's held in memory on the client.  As I understand it, because I'm using Forms Authentication, impersonation is not possible on the server unless I use LogonUser, which means I need the password on the server, so I need to transmit it each time, so I need to hold it in the client, in memory, until the app closes.
","Encryption should never be used for passwords.  When you encrypt something then it follows there should be a way to decrypt it.   One way hashes should always be used for passwords.  md5 and sha1 have been proven to be far too weak for any secuirty system.

","Are you saying you need to store the password for re-use in the silverlight app?  If you are concerned about the password appearing in memory un-encrypted then Silverlight then I think you're in trouble.
The .NET framework does have a SecureString class for exact purpose you outline.
Unfortunately the Silverlight version of the framework does not have this class.  Hence even if you were to keep the logical storage of the password encrypted at some point your code would need to decrypt it before using it.  At the point there is memory allocated containing the string in unencrypted form.
I don't know much about Forms authentication but if you can map the User principle to a domain user (which you seem to indicate you need) then you will want to use impersonation when running your code on the server.
Alternatively stop using Forms authentication and use Windows integrated authentication where you definitely can use impersonation server-side.

When I enter ""test"" for the value to decrypt, the PHP shows:
 - decrypted: dGVzdA== 
 - dec2: dGVzdA==
So, neither the openssl_private_decrypt() nor the DecryptData2() functions will correctly decrypt the values.  The EncryptData2() and DecryptData2() will work together though.
Is it possible I am missing something small?  Any advice?
Edit: Here are the commands I used to create the keys --
This creates the private key:
 openssl genrsa -out private.pem 1024

This creates the public key:
 openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout > public.pem

","You cannot securely encrypt anything on the client side. This is because the client has full control over any data that will be send, as well as the crypto engine.
There has been some debate about this in the past, and the conclusion is always the same. It cannot be done in any secure manner.
The question you should ask yourself is: what are you trying to protect yourself/your clients from?
If you try to protect yourself from people sniffing the wire or tampering with the request-data, the only viable solution is SSL.
If anything else, crypto is not the solution to look for.

","Your public key is used to encrypt a message, your private one to decrypt it. Thus with the public key, which you distribute, anyone can encrypt a message safe in the knowledge that only you (or someone with your private key) can decrypt it. To answer your question directly, no they are not interchangeable. You should never distribute your private key.
If you want to share a key with multiple possible customers, then there are really two options. Either you abandon asymmetric cryptography and find a secure way to distribute a symmetric key, for use with something like AES instead of RSA, to each of them, or you ask each of them to generate a key pair and provide you with their public key. Then you can decrypt what comes from the server, and re-encrypt for each customer. The number of customers will help dictate your choice between the two.

","The answer depends on whether you are asking your question out of mathematic curiosity, or for purely practical, cryptographic reasons.

If you are implementing a crypto system you should never disclose your private key, so in this sense the keys are absolutely not interchangeable. Furthermore, the usage scenario you describe seems like a good match for authentication rather than confidentiality, so the message that is sent by the server to the clients should indeed be signed and not encrypted. If you need confidentiality as well, you need a few more steps in your protocol.
From a mathematical point of view, the answer is OTOH ""yes"", presuming you use an internal representation of the private key that only contains the modulus N and the exponent D, and the other exponent E is generated randomly. The formula that describes the relation between the two exponents is 1 = E*D (mod phi(N)), so from a mathematical point of view it doesn't really matter which exponent is which.


But on the other hand, RSA generated keys appear to have different length

If you are using an implementation that produces RSA private keys that are significantly longer than the corresponding public keys, this almost always means the implementation is absolutely not suitable for using public and private keys interchangeably. The difference in length is usually due to a combination of the following:

The public exponent E is not generated randomly, but is a small, fixed constant, such as 3 or 0x10001. The private exponent D will on the other hand be almost as large as the modulus, so the private key data will be almost twice the size of the public key data. If you only got a RSA private key (N,D), your first guess on the public exponent would be either of the values 3 or 0x10001, and it would be easy the check if the guess is correct. Should you want the keys to be interchangeable, the exponent you pick first has to be picked randomly as an odd integer greater than 1 and less than phi(N) and with no prime factors in common with N or phi(N).
The private key data includes the factors P,Q of the public modulus N.
The private key data includes the public exponent E.

"33187988","Encrypt a SecretKey with RSA in Java","I'm working on a client-server secure protocol where I need to use RSA in Java to encrypt a SecretKey for HMAC digests because the key has to be sent to the server. The encryption has two stages; first, I need to encrypt the symmetric key with a public asymmetric key, then, that encrypted message is encrypted with a private asymmetric key.
For this purpose I generate the SecretKey as:
public SecretKey generate(){
KeyGenerator generator = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""HMACSHA256"");
k = generator.generateKey();
return k;
}

Later, I use this code to encrypt any byte array with a public key:
public byte[] encryptPublic(PublicKey key, byte[] array){
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
byte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(array);
return encrypted;
}

The code for encryption with a private key is the same but using a private key.
For the RSA encryption I'm using 1024 bit long asymmetric keys so I have two main questions:

How can I turn my SecretKey to a byte array in order to encrypt it with RSA and a public key? 
As the public key encryption produces a byte array with 128 bytes, how can I encrypt that message again with a private key if the key is 1024 bits long and can only encrypt a 117 byte long message?

How can I turn my SecretKey to a byte array in order to encrypt it with RSA and a public key?

                .getInstance(""RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA1AndMGF1Padding"");
        cipher.init(Cipher.WRAP_MODE, pubKey);
        final byte[] wrapped = cipher.wrap(symKey);
        return wrapped;

        throw new IllegalStateException(

                e);
    }
}

Note that this explicitly doesn't convert to byte[] first. That's because the key might well be within e.g. a hardware security module. In a HSM the wrapping may be possible, but the conversion to byte[] in local memory would usually not be possible. 


As the public key encryption produces a byte array with 128 bytes, how can I encrypt that message again with a private key if the key is 1024 bits long and can only encrypt a 117 byte long message?

You shouldn't do this and you cannot do this either. The reason that you shouldn't do it because encryption with the private key does not provide confidentiality, as anybody would have access to the public key.
Padding is required to perform secure RSA encryption. The padding overhead (of 11 bytes for PKCS#1 v1.5 style padding) is there prohibiting you to encrypt with the private key.
Note that the entire operation: encryption with a private key isn't even specified in PKCS#1 - it's not a legit operation.

Usually the much more secure ephemeral-ephemeral (EC)DH is used to establish keys in transport protocols, using the private key(s) only for authentication. You may want to take a hint from the (draft versions of) TLS 1.3. Or you may just want to use TLS or the handshake portion of it.

Public Key Encryption - when done ""by the book"" - seperates encryption and signing (""cannot be altered""). In your case, use two key pairs, one within the application and one at your site. Encrypt the file using the public application key and sign the file using your private one.
This is a really widespread usage, I even like to call it ""Best practice"". As for the downvote, I can only guess that ruling out signing in your question triggered this.

"34953732","Node.js correct way to make rsa encrypt?","i'm trying to create a WS for make soap request. In the body of the message there is a field that contains an encrypted text.
I have the public key to encrypt the text but the only result that i obtain is that the text is not recognized.
I use crypto module of node for making request and the text is crypted but i don't know why is not correclty encrypted.
Ps i made the same thing on php with openssl_public_encrypt function and working. But i have to do it in node.js.
Any idea or suggestion? What is different openssl_public_encrypt from crypto.publicEncrypt function?
Here is the encrypt part in node.js:
var crypto = require(""crypto"");
var fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile(""./certificate.pem"", 'utf8', function (err, data) {
    var bufferToEncrypt = new Buffer(""textToEncrypt"");
    var encrypted = crypto.publicEncrypt({""key"":data, padding:crypto.RSA_NO_PADDING}, bufferToEncrypt).toString(""base64"");
    console.log(encrypted);  // length 128
}

The same thing in php:
<?php

    $publicKey = ""./certificate.pem"";
    $plaintext = ""textToEncrypt"";

    openssl_public_encrypt($plaintext, $encrypted, $publicKey);

    echo base64_encode($encrypted);   //encrypted string length 128

?>

I don't have the private key for decrypting the text, i only have the public key.
Also notice that the length of the encrypted text (in base64) is the same in php and in node.js.
","I guess the padding is your problem. In node.js you specify padding:crypto.RSA_NO_PADDING. When looking up the doc of openssl_public_encrypt() it says that it uses OPENSSL_PKCS1_PADDING by default. Try the following:
var constants = require(""constants"");
var encrypted = crypto.publicEncrypt({""key"":data,
    padding:constants.RSA_PKCS1_PADDING}, bufferToEncrypt).toString(""base64"");

I have prepared an online demo:

Encrypt using node.js
copy the resulting string
and paste it to $encrypted_encoded on PHP decryption example


Advise: As a rule of thumb, don't use asymmetric encryption for actual messages. Use it to protect a symmetric key instead. However, your use case might be valid, I just want to state this every time someone talks RSA encryption.

","Others have provided a ""generic"" description and I'll go deeper into the real-life side.
Most modern asymmetric encryption standards operate not with raw public and private keys, but with more complex wrappers, such as X.509 certificates or OpenPGP keys (these are two most popular asymmetric encryption infrastructures today). Both certificates and OpenPGP keys contain extra information that lets them be easily identified, searched for and managed.
Now, the encrypted data block usually includes the public part (i.e. the certificate or public OpenPGP key) used for encryption, or at least the ID (hash of this public part). The recipient of the data usually has (or is supposed to have) both public and private parts (private keys are usually kept together with certificates or public openpgp keys) at hand. So when the recipient receives the encrypted data, he knows that he needs to look his private key storage for public part with given ID (or for given public part when it's included into the encrypted data). 
There exist cases when nothing is included. Then the recipient has nothing to do but try all available private keys for decryption. But such cases are rare as by default the certificate or key id are present in the encrypted data block.

","A private key is meant to be known only by its legitimate user and not distributed. Its counterpart, the public key, may be distributed to anyone.
Based on this, you can get 4 operations:

encrypt using the public key
decrypt using the private key
sign using the private key
verify the signature using the public key

The next problem you may encounter is the binding of an identity to a public key (as you wouldn't want to encrypt something with or trust something signed with the public key of an impostor). There are various models of public key distributions. Typically, you can have:

a web of trust, where people sign each other's association between the public key and the identity: this is typically the PGP model.
a public key infrastructure (PKI) where you get certification authorities to produce certificates, often with intermediates, in a tree-like hierarchy. (PGP can use this model too, but this seems less common.)

Now that I have the RSAPrameters, I have the key ""that I provide myself"", it could come from any secure storage - doesn't matter for this answer.

No it won't. SSL uses symmetric encryption.

The client and server already have a symmetric encryption key, as soon as the session is estalbished. This would be merely redundant.

","In your Java code, you have the modulus and exponent encoded as Base64 strings, but you are converting those to byte arrays by decoding using the string encoding (e.g. UTF-8) which gives you bogus byte values. This is giving you an entirely different RSA key than you expect:
Sun RSA public key, 1375 bits
  modulus: 750169282846494125860884712723073313436806987678989257696854519163422196468501094334772708285571263987960096312310946772203386096382092764988823316042225715695209682181694351362408270131738979229545667503402617569939108631330090897309670319383704572983438399762295114985980168234669536869729771611691862551491497864929321166916789165923322527018195770714618713254889722551163557798154618552019060264304749542004029
  public exponent: 1095844162
Your ciphertext is in modulus 1375, not 1024, so the error string is correct. The Java-produced ciphertext of modulus 1375 (172 bytes) exceeds the modulus of the .NET code, which is still 1024 (limited to 128 bytes.)
If instead, you Base64-decode those strings like this, for example:
byte[] modulusBytes = DatatypeConverter.parseBase64Binary(""tr82UfeGetV7yBKcOPjFTWs7pHqqr/5YKKWMUZ/HG4HnCmWrZsOhuR1FBnMZ/g2YiosoSlu0zd7Ukz9lX7wv2RLfWXfMvZYGpAAvfYWwzbyQ2i1q+tKE/thgKNscoSRellDD+uJcYn1H4hnaudVyYJH9miVhOKhKlExMzw8an6U="");
byte[] exponentBytes = DatatypeConverter.parseBase64Binary(""AQAB"");

then you will get the key that you wanted:
Sun RSA public key, 1024 bits

  public exponent: 65537
and your Java code will product this result:
""P2ENQbBu3rpBcrfnzbOj6MLCGBABclQnVY6QpHJ54uXZnKSd2Ll9fJ6g+avsvbWib9SNKsL9Yx+PeRdC20W6BXfblSnXMAbZxJ2VQCQho44rR+k6B9HrB2i0zl9pdLSRxm9k0poQVG1I/yplmK1H9TGqlZp1oYnbzWrS8JiRd5w=""
and your .NET code will decrypt correctly to ""Manchester United"".
EDIT:
Base64.decode should match the output of DatatypeConverter.parseBase64Binary. The output I get with this loop:
for (int i = 0; i < modulusBytes.length; i++)
{
    System.out.print("" "");
    System.out.print(modulusBytes[i]);
}
System.out.println();

is this:

Try Base64-decoding the string on the .NET platform, and see if it matches the decode result on the Java platform.

Please can you tell me which is true? Thanks
And does anyone know a guide where it is explained step by step the handshake of tls protocol over https?
","The best answer is that it does both. TLS uses asymmetric encryption to first establish identity of one or both parties. Secondly, it uses asymmetric encryption to exchange a key to a symmetric cipher. So asymmetric is only used during the initial setup of communication.
Symmetric encryption which is used through the rest is faster and more efficient with large amounts of data transfer. The keys are smaller which is generally why it's faster, but it's algorithm is also easier to process.
As far as a guide goes, a simple Google search will give you plenty. The one I found from IBM looks decent. They removed some of the excess detail to make it easier to understand.

That means I want to let the client connect to my server every single time it starts. This also gives me the ability to disable keys (in case of chargebacks on paypal or distribution of the code). Of course this might be a hassle for other users, but it is necessary in this case.
Since I was unable to find any good .NET Licensing systems that are uncracked, I wanted to take the approach of writing a little one myself.

Generate a key.dat containing 1024 characters that gets shipped with the software (individual to each user)
In the application entrypoint add a httprequest to my server that sends the key.dat + current timestamp, encrypted.
My HTTP server (running PHP) decrypts the request and checks if the key is valid (in my database) and replies with the ""access level"" (license type). If the key is invalid or disabled it replies with an errorcode. Just like with the request, the reply is being salted with a timestamp, so someone can't validate his program by sending a valid packet to himself. The timestamp is being checked in the client. The reply is encrypted with RSA and a previously generated public key.

Is RSA the correct approach for this?

I do not think RSA is your best choice.
One of the capabilities of PKE (Public Key Encryption) is that it lets parties talk to each other who previously have never exchanged information before (eg. strangers).
I do not see this applying to your case.  Your software knows your server well.  They are not ""strangers"".
Consider instead Shared Secret Key encryption, where each copy of the software you distribute is given a unique secret key, and your server knows each user's secret key as well.  The keys are never sent, and must be protected, but can still be used to encrypt, sign, and validate communications.

Edit After considering the comments and other answers.
Anyone who wants your software badly enough will be able to bypass the authentication completely.   RSA does nothing to prevent that.
The real question is: Does breaking a single license make all licenses vulnerable/worthless.   In both cases, (RSA and Secret Key), the answer is No.  Just because one copy of the software got hacked and got its key exposed, or the licenses system bypassed, other copies are no more exposed.  PKE and SSE seem equal in that respect to me.
Because Shared Secret Key is easier to implement, and computationally faster to execute, I think it is preferred in this case over RSA/PKE.  That is not to say RSA is ""wrong"".  It will accomplish what you are after, to the same degree that SSE will (no more, no less).  But I think SSE is the smarter choice.

","Someone who wants your software bad enough will just decompile it and remove the part of the code that phones home on startup.
If you were to add a checksum to the app that checks whether the code has been altered, someone can just change the checksum the program checks against (or remove the check entirely).
People who want your application enough will find ways around any type of protection you can conceive. You're better off sticking to something simple, having a product that is worth paying for (and easily) and make sure it's worth the price you're asking.

EDIT
Given that protection is important, the fact that the users will have code running on their machines is a risk you can avoid. If the users don't have the code, they can't crack it. They can't copy it and share it.
Now, it might not apply to the application you intend to write, but you should consider writing a web, Flash or Silverlight application instead of a regular client application. That way you don't have to distribute the code to customers. All you have to do is manage credentials into the application, which should be a lot easier than your round-about RSA system.
It's also easier to push out new versions of the software in a centralized model, and you won't have to worry about theft at all. Of course, load will become an issue when it wasn't before. And not all applications can be centralized easily (or at all). I'm just proposing this to make sure you consider it because it is a valid solution to your problem.
A web-based application will have the same issues as your application (i.e. it will be down whenever the user is offline, whenever the network is down, whenever your server is down, etc). So there's no added risk in that regard.

","
How the key-pair and certificate are generated depends on the software used.
The private key can be obtained from a certificate.

The general method is to encrypt data with a symmetric encryption algorithm such as AES and encrypting the symmetric key with asymmetric encryption algorithm such as RSA or EC and the public key. This is done for two reasons: 1. Asymmetric encryption is very slow compared to symmetric encryption. 2. The data length for Asymmetric encryption is limited by the key size: a typical key size is 2048-bits and that limits the data length to 245-bytes.
There is in general no way to securely store a private key (or anything) on the server other than the server being secure short of the server having an HSM or access to a TPM. The main step on making the server secure is 2-factor authentication. But if it is on a shared computer beware of root escalation exploits by other users of the server.

TPM - Trusted Platform Module

","El Gamal can be seen as a variant of the Diffie Hellman algorithm, and parameters for the latter can be used for the former. So for example you can use IKE groups 1 and 2 from RFC 2409, and larger IKE groups sprinkled in other RFCs. You can also follow the discussion in FIPS 186 for generating DSA parameters. Also, see this discussion of primitive roots.
EDIT:
As noted by @abc, this is wrong for el gamal signatures. Follow the DSA link (FIPS 186).

Would it be true to say that a prime number has at least 1 generator?
","Use DSA instead of the ElGamal signature scheme.
There are just too many mistakes that can be made implementing ElGamal. One of those mistakes is what GregS proposed: to use the IKE parameters. These parameters were generated for the ElGamal encryption and not for the signature scheme. The two schemes have distinct requirements. In particular using g=2 as a generator is a good choice for the encryption, but a very bad choice for the signature scheme. (See e.g. the ""Handbook of Applied Cryptography"" http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/ note 11.67 in chapter 11 for some details). Correct would be to select the generator randomly. But once again, if you just use DSA then you can simply avoid these pitfalls by following the standard.
Just to add a little more: OpenPGP http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880 used to allow ElGamal signatures, but has deprecated them some time ago. This deprecation was quite reasonable, since DSA has only advantages: it is more efficient, more secure and standardized. Of course, you could look at old PGP implementations, but it wouldn't tell you if these implementations give you reasonable choices without reading the literature first.

how are generators found for the elgamal signature scheme?
  are there values that are used by most programs that are good generators?
  or is there a method to find a generator for a prime value? if so, how?

You can use the generic, probabilistic algorithm 4.86 in Handbook of Applied Cryptography. You still need to weed out from the output of such algorithm the values known to be insecure for Elgamal signature though. At the very least any value that divides p-1 (for instance 2) and any value whose inverse divides p-1. Note that those are the conditions I am aware of today. Some in-depth research over papers published on the topic may be needed.
Personally, I would not trust domain parameters already used in existing programs. The authors may not have considered all the conditions above, plus research may have highlighted new conditions since they were chosen.

Would it be true to say that a prime number has at least 1 generator?

Absolutely true: there always is at least one generator for the multiplicative group over the integers modulo p (with p being a prime number). It has actually many more: phi(phi(p)), with phi being the totient function. Not all of them will be safe for the Elgamal signature scheme though.

Does every message to one person need to be encrypted using different nonces? 

Yes.  In fact, never, ever use the same nonce more than one for the same private key.  It is true that you would have to keep track of the nonce to accomplish this.  

This does not seem right since I would have to store the used nonces on a server with public access where an attacker could just use one of the used nonces again.

Why would you have to store your nonce on a server with public access? And how do you think an attacker could ""use"" the nonce?  They would need your private key to do so.
Why can't you store the nonce in the same place as your private key?

","A unique nonce is required for every message sent using a given shared secret key. The nonce doesn't have to be secret; a simple counter is totally fine; changing a single bit in the nonce is going to make the ciphertext look totally different even if the same message is sent twice.
What's a shared secret? It a key calculated from (A's secret key, B's public key) or (A's public key, B's secret key). A and B perform a different calculation, based on what they have, but end up with the same shared secret.
The shared secrets used in crypto_box are 256-bit long. Which is huge. You can safely consider that shared secrets are going to be unique for each ""conversation"".
So, (A, B), (A, C) and (C, B) can safely exchange messages using the same nonces.
But if A sends a message to B using a given nonce, B cannot send a message to A using the same nonce. Nonces have to be unique for everything exchanged during a conversation between A and B.
So, a simple counter can be fine. Have A pick even numbers, leave odd numbers to B, increment the nonce by 2 after every message sent and you're good to go.
But the cipher used in the crypto_box construction actually has a really huge nonce. 192 bits.
Which means that if you ignore everything I wrote and just pick a random nonce every time you send a message, the probability to get a collision is so small that you can rest assured that it will never ever happen in practice.
Some stream ciphers included in Sodium (AES128-CTR, ChaCha20, Salsa20) have a shorter nonce, and require a counter to avoid collisions. This is why they are in the ""advanced"" section of the documentation.
But with crypto_box and crypto_secretbox, just pick a random nonce every time (randombytes_buf(nonce, sizeof nonce)) and you will be safe.

I just want to do asymmetric encryption where I encrypt the data with private key and store the public key to decrypt it. I am a beginner and I am sorry for my blunt mistakes.
","DES Ciphers don't support RSA keys. DES is a symmetric cipher algorithm while RSA is asymmetric. Symmetric ciphers require the use of the same key for encryption and decryption while asymmetric ciphers use public/private keypairs.
You have two options to get your encryption working:

You could use your current symmetric cipher and create a symmetric key (maybe by using a KeyGenerator)  
You can change your cipher instance to an assymetric one like ""RSA"".
String xform = ""RSA"";


Note:
What you are trying to do is not encrypting but signing as encryption would be done with the public key.
Furthermore you should not encrypt complete files by an asymmetric mode but only a symmetric key which you use to encrypt and decrypt your data symmetrically. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography#Computational_cost.

","In general, if you encrypt a file with k-bit AES then again with k-bit AES, you only get (k+1) bits of security, rather than 2k bits of security, with a man-in-the-middle attack.  The same holds for most types of encryption, like DES.  (Note that triple-DES is not simply three rounds of encryption for this reason.)
Further, encrypting a file with method A and then with method B need not be even as strong as encrypting with method B alone!  (This would rarely be the case unless method A is seriously flawed, though.)  In contrast, you are guaranteed to be at least as strong as method A.  (Anyone remembering the name of this theorem is encouraged to leave a comment; I've forgotten.)
Usually you're much better off simply choosing a single method as strong as possible.

For your second question: Yes, with most methods, an attacker would know that the first layer had been compromised.

**Assuming hypothetically that they somehow brute-forced their way through weak passwords - since this appears to be a technological possibility with 256-AES right now if you know how to make secure ones...
","More an opinion here...
First, when computer are strong enough to do a brute-force attack on AES-256 for example, it will be also for iterations of the same... doubling or tripling the time or effort is insignificant at that level.
Next, such considerations can be void depending on the application you are trying to use this encryption in... The ""secrets"" you will need to carry become bigger (number of iterations and all the different keys you will need, if in fact they are different), the time to do the encryption and the decryption will also need to increase.
My hunch is that iterating the encryption does not help much. Either the algorithm is strong enough to sustain a brute-force attach or it is not. The rest is all in the protection of the keys.
More practically, do you think your house is more protected if you have three identical or similar locks on your front door ? (and that includes number of keys for you to carry around, don't loose those keys, make sure windows and back door are secured also...)

","Question 1:
The size of the solution space is going to be the same for two passes of the 256-bit key as the 512-bit key, since 2^(256+256) = 2^512
The actual running time of each decrypt() may increase non-linearly as the key-size grows (it would depend on the algorithm), in this case I think brute forcing the 256+256 would run faster than the 2^512, but would still be infeasible.
Question 2:
There are probably ways to identify certain ciphertext. I wouldn't be surprised if many algorithms leave some signature or artifacts that could be used for identification.

","I've needed to do this for a little project I've been building in the evenings.
We know the following creates a new key pair (public/private):
function newPair (&$private, &$public, $passphrase=null) {
    $res = openssl_pkey_new ();
    if ($res === false) {
        throw new Exception (""Key generation failed: "".openssl_error_string ());
        return false;
    }
    // Sets private by reference
    if (openssl_pkey_export ($res, $private, $passphrase) === false) {
        throw new Exception (""Private key export failed: "".openssl_error_string ());
        return false;
    }
    // Array returns, contains ""key"" element.
    $public = openssl_pkey_get_details($res);
    if ($public === false) {
        throw new Exception (openssl_error_string ());
        return false;
    }
    $public = $public[""key""];
    return true;
}

open_ssl_pkey_export() does the passphrase magic.  So we can change the passphrase as so:
function changePassphrase ($private, $old, $new=null) {
    $res = openssl_pkey_get_private ($private, $old);
    if ($res === false) {
        throw new Exception (""Loading private key failed: "".openssl_error_string ());
        return false;
    }
    if (openssl_pkey_export ($res, $result, $new) === false) {
        throw new Exception (""Passphrase change failed: "".openssl_error_string ());
        return false;
    }
    return $result;
}

I hope you can follow what we've done here ... !  (Obviously the exception throwing is purely optional ... I've just pulled the code verbatim from my codebase.)
changePassphrase() takes the private key as a string, along with the current and new passphrases.  We use openssl_pkey_get_private() to retrieve a handle to the private key, unlocking it with the old passphrase.
(It's worth noting that the passphrase is literally used to encrypt the private key, which may sound a little double-dutch!  [Encrypting the encryption key ... ?!]  openssl_pkey_get_private() returns FALSE if it fails to interpret the key - i.e. if the passphrase is wrong, and the private key decrypts to an invalid value.  Make sense?)
Having unlocked the private key with the old passphrase, we take the OpenSSL key handle and pass it to openssl_pkey_export() - just like we did after creating it in the first place (via openssl_pkey_new()) providing the new passphrase ... and hey-presto.
I hope my code example reads cleanly, I've tried to write it in a fashion that's easy to understand and follow, without unnecessary ""compression"" and short-cutting.
Good luck!

Using the following link, for testing purposes as well, I was also able to encrypt and then decrypt the string ""hello world!"" using nodeJs:

var fs = require('fs');
var ursa = require('/PATH/ursa');

var pubkeyAlice = ursa.createPublicKey(fs.readFileSync(""/PATH/public.pem""));
var privkeyAlice = ursa.createPrivateKey(fs.readFileSync(""/PATH/private.pem""));

var msg = ""hello world!"";
var enc = pubkeyAlice.encrypt(msg, 'utf8', 'base64');
console.log('encrypted string:'+enc);

var rcv = privkeyAlice.decrypt(enc, 'base64', 'utf8');
console.log('decrypted', rcv, '\n');


Both of the following examples printed ""hello world!"" successfully. Next, I took the encrypted string, NSString*encWithPubKey, from what I got in objective-C (which is in base64 format) and then I tried to decrypt it with nodeJS:
    var privkeyAlice = ursa.createPrivateKey(fs.readFileSync(""/PATH/private.pem""));

    var enc = <  HERE IS THE ENCRYPTED STRING RECEIVED FROM Objective-C : encWithPubKey  >
    var rcv = privkeyAlice.decrypt(enc, 'base64', 'utf8');
    console.log('decrypted', rcv, '\n');

However, when doing so, I receive the following error in nodeJS:

Error: error:040A1079:rsa routines:RSA_padding_check_PKCS1_OAEP_mgf1:oaep decoding error

From my understanding, this error means that the encrypted string was invalid. However, I am unable to understand why I am getting this error. I am able to encrypt and decrypt the same string if I do it with the same language, however, I am unable to communicate between the two languages.

","Don't. The correct solution to encrypt communication between two systems is to use TLS. Trying to implement encryption yourself is almost certainly not going to end well and will end up with your crypto being broken - it's very hard to securely implement encryption, to the point that even experienced cryptographers avoid it wherever they can.
After having discussed this question on IRC a bit more with the author, and determining that the rationale against using TLS was that ""the client can load a custom CA and intercept the requests with something like Burp anyway"":
Preventing client modifications is not possible. The client is fundamentally untrusted, and it is a technical impossibility to ensure that a client does not tamper with requests. Instead, the validation of requests should happen on the server-side, so that it doesn't matter what kind of tampering the client does. This article goes into more detail.

","Your Encrypt function is writing XML that does not contain a KeyName element, and so your call to DecryptDocument cannot find the key.
I didn't look any further into why your Encrypt is writing incomplete XML, but you can find another example Encrypt function on MSDN here: AddKeyNameMapping Method.
Replace just your Encrypt function with the function in that MSDN example, changing only the function argument type for Alg from SymmetricAlgorithm to RSA, and remove your third argument ""EncryptedElement1"" from the call to Encrypt in your existing code, to get it to compile, and it should run to the end of your Decrypt and work.
Once you have that running, you can work backwards looking at the differences in your Encrypt to the one in this example, or, just keep this one if it works for you.

","SAML 2.0 utilizes XML Encryption (Sect 5.2.1 and 5.2.2). With that said, Sect 4.2 of the SAML 2.0 Conformance docs specifies you must support the following to be SAML 2.0 compliant:

Block Encryption: TRIPLE DES, AES-128, AES-256.
Key Transport: RSA-v1.5, RSA-OAEP

In other words, SAML 2.0  mandates you use asymmetric keys. 
So, the ""cons"" will be that you are not SAML 2.0 compliant if you utilize symmetric encryption of SAML Attributes which will lead to interopability issues with other SAML 2.0 partners. However, that does not mean that you cannot actually choose to use this type of encryption as long as your partner supports this as well. 
On the ""pros"" side, symmetric encryption is faster (less computationally intensive I'm told) but I'm pretty sure it's not worth the trade-off wrt compliance.

","Keep in mind that in reality you are always using both asymmetric and symmetric encryption - this is best practice in security.  The underlying block encryption method that is symmetric (as noted by Ian: Triple DES, AES, etc.).  Asymmetric is preferred due to stronger security (larger key sizes, etc.) - and ease of keeping the private keys secure (only the public keys need to be distributed).  However due to its performance it's only used as a means to exchange symmetric keys.  Symmetric encryption on the bulk of the data is done for speed.
In the XML Encryption spec, EncryptedData element contains symmetrically encrypted data, while EncryptedKey is your symmetric encryption/decryption key, encrypted via asymmetric encryption.

","If you want to understand XML encryption, Don Eastlake's classic, Secure XML: The New Syntax for Signatures and Encryption, is still the best.  He explains the trade-offs in the designs for XML Enc and DSig, and has tips about implementation.  In the 9 years since he wrote it, many conventions have arisen about these trade-offs, which you can find via search.
My colleague, Ian, has listed the SAML 2.0 required algorithms, so you can focus on these in Eastlake's book.  And as you are probably aware, ""required"" in a spec means that if you limit yourself to just these, you will be interoperable.
Finally, this technique Scott describes, of generating a random symmetrical key, encrypting the data with it, and then encrypting the random symmetrical key w/ the public encryption key of your recipient is ofter called digital enveloping and is used everywhere in cryptography, from SSL to key management systems.

","In brief: 
the data is encrypted using symmetric algorithm and a random symmetric key. Then the random key is encrypted using public asymmetric key. The encrypted random key is stored together with the encrypted data. To decrypt the data one uses private asymmetric key to decrypt the stored random key, then the decrypted random key is used to decrypt the data.
256-bit is the length of the key. However, it has dramatically different meaning for symmetric and asymmetric keys. For symmetric keys 256 bits are a very strong key (you can have even longer keys with AES 384 or AES 512 where the numbers specify the key length the algorithm operates with). For asymmetric algorithms 256 bits is nothing, and comparable strength is 2048 bits. 
Public key encryption can be implemented using any language, that supports math operations and arrays. However, doing this is reinventing the wheels. There exists a number of cross-platform libraries for PKI: open-source OpenSSL for C++, BouncyCastle for Java and some more. Our company offers a supported and maintained SecureBlackbox product for .NET, Windows and Linux (MacOS X version to come soon).
Also there's a couple of books about PKI that we recommend to all our users. RSA's guide is an easy reading (but very useful) and the second book goes into deeper details.

","Digital Signature is the Encrypted (with private key) cipher of the Hash of the message.
Signature s = c(h(m))
Now s is attached to the message m. Signed message to be transmitted from Alice to Bob is m+s
After receiving m+s on Bob's side, Bob would decrypt the signature with Alice's public key which would be present in the certificate. So here he does d(s) = d(c(h(m)) = h(m)
Also the Bob received the message so he would compute the hash of the message m which is h(m)
Now he would compare the outputs from both the above steps to see if they match. This ensures the message has not been tampered with by anyone in between.
This is the general idea of how Digital signatures work. Hope this helps.

","RSA with 8-bit key :)
Seriously though, the block-based cyphers are stateless - the ciphertext of a block depends only on the cleartext of the block, not on the previous blocks (otherwise it would be a stream cypher). A block cypher that acts on 8-bit blocks can be brute-forced easily, so there's no point.

","A block cipher with 8-bit blocks means that each input block can be encrypted into 256 possible values -- which means that an attacker has a 1/256 chance of guessing the input value. It turns out to be very difficult to use such an algorithm securely. Nevertheless it is possible to define a block cipher over 8-bit blocks, and to do it ""perfectly""; just do not expect it to be generally useful.
There also are ""block-less"" ciphers, known as ""stream ciphers"" which encrypt data ""byte by byte"" (or even ""bit by bit""); most are just pseudo-random generators which produce an arbitrary amount of bytes from a key. That generated stream is just to be combined with the data to encrypt with a XOR. The traditional stream cipher is RC4; but newer and better stream ciphers have been designed.
A block cipher, by itself, is a mathematical tool. In order to actually encrypt data, the block cipher must be used properly. The keywords are chaining and padding. Chaining is about defining what actually goes into the block cipher and what to do with the output. Padding is about adding some bytes to the data, in a reversible way, so that the padded message length is appropriate for the chosen chaining mode. The traditional chaining mode is  called CBC. A newer (and arguably better) chaining mode is CTR (same link), which has the added bonus of avoiding the need for padding (CTR just turns a block cipher into a stream cipher).
As for block ciphers, you should use AES instead of TripleDES. It is faster, more secure, and the current American standard.

","The exception has to do with the RSA public key that Java is using. None of your code addresses that point. How did the Java side obtain that key, what format is being used?
One common mistake that can account for the error is if the modulus is converted to an array of bytes but a leading zero byte is not present when it needs to be. Basically, this BigInteger constructor is a little trickier to use than it may first appear. It is designed for compatibility with DER-encoded ASN.1 integers. The upshot of it all is that if the first byte b of your modulus has the high bit set, i.e. 128 <= b < 256, you must prepend a leading zero byte or your modulus will be interpreted as a negative number. For simplicity you can always prepend a leading zero byte; no harm will come if it wasn't necessary.

","The peer's public key is a point on the curve. From crypto\ec\ec_lcl.h:
struct ec_key_st {
    int version;

    EC_GROUP *group;

    EC_POINT *pub_key;
    BIGNUM   *priv_key;

    unsigned int enc_flag;
    point_conversion_form_t conv_form;

    int     references;
    int flags;

    EC_EXTRA_DATA *method_data;
} /* EC_KEY */;

I believe you need to call EC_POINT_new (c_lcl.h is a private header, so you won't have access to the structure).
Luckily, there's a lot of functions to manipulate them. From the EC_POINT_new(3) docs:

EC_POINTs can be converted to and from various external
  representations. Supported representations are octet strings, BIGNUMs
  and hexadecimal. The format of the external representation is
  described by the point_conversion_form. See EC_GROUP_copy(3) for a
  description of point_conversion_form. Octet strings are stored in a
  buffer along with an associated buffer length. A point held in a
  BIGNUM is calculated by converting the point to an octet string and
  then converting that octet string into a BIGNUM integer. Points in
  hexadecimal format are stored in a NULL terminated character string
  where each character is one of the printable values 0-9 or A-F (or
  a-f).

Also see EC_POINT_set_affine_coordinates_GFp, EC_POINT_set_affine_coordinates_GF2m and EC_KEY_set_public_key:
$ grep -R EC_KEY_set_public_key *
crypto/ec/ec.h:int EC_KEY_set_public_key(EC_KEY *key, const EC_POINT *pub);
...

","RSA can only encrypt data smaller than the key length.
The answer is to encrypt the data with a symmetric algorithm such as AES which is designed to encrypt small and large data.
If an RSA public/private key pair are required encrypt the symmetric (AES) key with RSA. This is referred to as hybrid encryption and in essence is hoe HTTPS encrypts data.
But it is may not necessary to RSA encrypt the symmetric key unless a public/private key pair are required. In the general case one just uses symmetric (AES) and that key. What is the use case for a public/private key pair?

","Don't encrypt your SSNs, hash them
It sounds like you should be hashing the SSNs rather than encrypting them. The difference between the two is that hashing is one-way while encryption is not. But as you don't need to verify the value of the data, just the integrity, I would definitely use hashing because

Hashing is more secure than encryption as hashed SSNs can not be unhashed
Hashing still allows you to verify the integrity of the data and check for duplicate SSNs in your database.

How to hash
If you're using PHP 5 >= 5.5.0, I would strongly recommend using PHP's built in password hashing functions. It's battle tested and created for this very situation. It even auto generates its own secure salt (but still has the option of you providing your own).
Make sure you carefully read the documentation on password hashing functions, but a short example (taken from the docs' example) is below:
<?php
// To create the password hash:
$ssn = password_hash($ssn, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
// To verify the integrity of what the user is entering
// In this example, $hash is the hashed password generated from password_hash
if (password_verify('rasmuslerdorf', $hash)) {
    echo 'SSN is valid!';
} else {
    echo 'Invalid SSN.';
}
?>

Remember to check the docs on the password hashing functions so you correctly use them:

password_get_info
password_hash
password_needs_rehash
password_verify

","A little late to the game, but I took a two-pronged approach.
We split the SSN into two parts:

XXX-XX
3847

The first part of the SSN is encrypted using some encryption algorithm (blowfish?) or whatever flavor you choose. 
The database:
--------------------------------------------------------
| ID    |   SSN-A    |   SSN-B    | ......   |         |
--------------------------------------------------------
|   1   | N1maA+HCRj |    3847    |    ...   |         |
|   2   | HCRjHQiEx/ |    7254    |    ...   |         |
--------------------------------------------------------

When records are exported or dumped into a CSV for consumption by another entity, you can decrypt the first part of the SSN one by one and then reassemble the complete SSN.
As long as the key is stored securely, then there is a reasonable sense of security here. The added benefit of this is - while you cannot do a whole SSN search, you can at least limit them by using the last 4 digits. There is a whole set of regulations around storing SSN's, so whatever way you choose - be careful.
Edit
It would also probably be wise to name the columns something non deterministic of an SSN field.

"6983150","How to distribute public key in asymmetric encryption algorithms?","There are two keys in asymmetric encryption algorithm

public key and 
private key

For the concept of client and server, it need to public key on server side to decrypt client's message.
So my question is how can we share public key between client and server? 
I am using JAVA, so if your example contains java code this will ok for me, or if any pictorial info, this will very ok. 
Thank you!
","If the client hasn't met the server before, so he doesn't know what public key to expect, one must use a third party intermediary to validate the identities involved. In P2P scenarios, you have what are called ""key signing parties"", where people exchange public keys through meeting face-to-face.
If the people already know eachother, then, even through an insecure channel, you can use algorithms like Diffie-Hellman to exchange your identities, which you can validate against the information you already had about the identity of that person.
In a common HTTPS scenario, the client may not already know the server, but the server presents a certificate, validated by a mutually-trusted third party, that acknowledges his identity. For instance, Paypal might present you with a certificate that says ""VeriSign agrees I am who I say I am."", and if you trust VeriSign, this ""web of trust"" as it's called means you'll trust Paypal are who they says they are.
In your client-server scenario, the server needs both its private and public key - the public key is used for encrypting the messages going back to the client, and the private key is used to decrypt the messages the client is sending to him. 
The server doesn't usually know who the user is (cryptographically speaking), the client may make a new certificate and public/private keypair for each request it sends. A way to change this is detailed in this IBM article. What ends up happening in usual HTTPS scenarios is a mixture of private and public key encryptions; you can read more about that in this related SO post.
Good luck!

","You cannot just use the cipher text as input for the String constructor, as you are doing in this line:
encryptedMessage = new String(encryptedData, ""UTF-8"");

You will have to use an encoding such as Base 64 as you did with the keys, if you want to communicate the cipher text using strings instead of bytes.
Encryption will result in data that looks like random bytes. Not all bytes have a character equivalent. The result of the conversion depends on the character encoding. UTF-8 may use many bytes, and many combinations won't result in correct characters. Java silently converts these, check the Charset and related classes for more information.

I'm currently using RSA with 4096-bit keys to encrypt a 256-bit randomly generated AES key for each file, but performance is somewhat lacking, as one required operation is to scan through all the files (estimated number when the system is in use is around 10,000) and identify which ones can be decrypted using a specific private key.  While I don't expect this operation to be instant, it is taking too long at the moment (~2 files processed per second).

","I'd go for an approach that requires less RSA operations. SSL/TLS, although they use RSA etc for encrypting AES etc keys, do not use AES for the data simply because it is a computationally expensive operation at sufficiently large key sizes for security to be done on a per-packet, or in your case, per-file basis.
Another public key system is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption. Security-wise I believe it has yet to be broken but would personally put my trust in RSA for now. I do not know if there are any elliptic curve encryption algorithms currently available - that is to say I know they are being researched but understand they may not be ready for production use and I heard there were patent issues.

","For your question as asked, try Diffie-Hellman over elliptic curves, also known as ""ECDH"". Estimating security is a bit difficult once we deal with sizes that cannot be cracked with current technology, since this depends on how we bet on future technological evolutions. Yet one can say that ECDH over the P-256 curve provides ""128 bits"" of security, a level which is similar to what you would get from 2048-bit RSA. That level is widely sufficient for all current usages, or, more appropriately said, if P-256 is not enough for you then your problem has very special needs and cryptographic strength is likely to be the least of your worries.
On my PC (a 2.4 Ghz Intel Core2, 64-bit mode, running Linux), OpenSSL claims to crunch out about 900 ECDH instances per second, using a single core.
Edit: for estimation of key security, depending on the length, for several algorithms, see this site.

","Use stream cipher instead and only encrypt that key for this cipher with RSA. This may help if you need RSA because of its public-private key logic and want to use the different keys for encryption and decryption. With stream cipher you would be able encrypt and decrypt gigabytes of data no problem.
RSA is normally not used for really big amounts of data.

","It's not about what's more secure because nothing is 100% bullet proof. It's a question on ""how to make it as difficult as possible""
You could see it from this point: If you store keys on the computer, they're there 24/7. If my pair of keys is on an external device, the keys are only accessible while attached to the device. ==> You reduce the timeframe in which somebody else can copy your keys. It's much easier to access something if physical access is not needed.
Think of online banking: Many banks have added ""external"" ways of authentifcation such as Tan / Tac /tanSMS/ tokengenerators etc. etc. Neither of those is secure for itself: I can steal your login password, I can steal your mobile phone, I can steal your Tac/Tan list and so on. But chaces are very low that I can steal all necessary elements at once => All pieces of the puzzle together create a quite secure solution.
Also think of these factors:

money: Do you really need a 70$ token-based-protection for your 100$ app?
time: I would say that software based systems are faster
relevance: Does it make sense to provide my apps with such a complex protection system

","Yes, there are.
For one thing, this allows you to transmit the private keys physically through secure channels, rather than trusting a network.
For another, if you have to move around between a lot of systems that aren't nessecarily all networked, the USB key is just way more convienent. That's why the military uses a system very much like that (EKMS). They don't use USB, but they use little dongles that look like big plastic keys. The idea is the same, but USB didn't exist back in the early 90's when they were developing this.

","I think it depends on the purpose/usage of your application.  If you're developing a product for a high security need, such as banking or government, a hardware addition to your solution could be entirely appropriate.  You have to consider the additional costs that a hardware solution would add to the project.  Not just in the initial development, but the ongoing hardware maintenance costs that would be required after development is complete.  From my perspective, having worked banking in the past, there were very, very few solutions where we felt that a hardware solution was worth the additional costs it would entail.

They work in this manner: for encryption I break the string to at most, 20 size substrings, and then use the Cipher to encrypt them. For decryption, I break byte array to 64 byte blocks, and apply Cipher decryption to them. 
Is there already a function which do this? Or at least is there a neater solution? How safe is my approach? Is encryption result length (result.length) always 64 on all distributions of JRE?
Thanx,
","RSA is suited to key encipherment, not bulk data encryption.
Instead of encrypting messages with RSA, most protocols generate a key for a symmetric cipher, like AES, and encrypt the message with that. Then, RSA is used to encrypt that symmetric key so that only the message recipient can recover it. The RSA-encrypted symmetric key is sent with the AES-encrypted message to the recipient.

","It's right - when you encrypt something it's treated as a byte array and is returned as such. 0x47 is G, 72 is r etc. 
If you examine the documentation for DecryptByAsmKey you'll notice the return type is varbinary with a maximum size of 8,000 bytes. You'll also notice the convert in the example.
So if you are encrypting and decrypting strings you must convert like so
SELECT CONVERT(varchar(max),DECRYPTBYASYMKEY(ASYMKEY_ID('myasymkey'), 
    EncryptByAsymKey(AsymKey_ID('myasymkey'), 
    'Greg'), 
    N'123pass!'));

Also note you need to make sure you're converting to varchar(max) or nvarchar(max) depending on your input. If you tried
SELECT CONVERT(nvarchar(max),DECRYPTBYASYMKEY(ASYMKEY_ID('myasymkey'), 
    EncryptByAsymKey(AsymKey_ID('myasymkey'), 
    'Greg'), 
    N'123pass!'));

it would be wrong, as your input of 'Greg' is a varchar.

"14814235","Software license decryption with a public key stored in the application binary","With reference to the answer of this question I can not understand how can the software licensing scheme works if the Private Key is kept on the license server and the public key is shipped in the application executable, and not vice verse.
I'm trying to do the following software licensing scheme:

User gets a Product ID (based on GUID) upon purchase and uses this inside the application to activate it.
The application connects to the license server which sends back encrypted text using RSA public key. This text (license) will be stored on the user's hard disk.
Each time the application starts it needs to decrypt this license using RSA private key, in order to extract different parameters like product edition, product limitations, registered to what company etc.

How can the application decrypt this license text if it does not have the private key but the public key?
Thanks!
EDIT:

If the key used to encrypt the license is available only on the server side and not to the public, can we call this a private key? In this case, if one side has the key for encryption and the other side (the public) has the key for decryption, can the side that has the key for decryption obtain the key for encryption? The concern is based on the various topics on stackoverflow that it's not that difficult to generate the public key given the private key. If you have the private key, you effectively can have both keys.
The idea is that once the software is activated it should no longer need to connect to the license server.

","I don't really see the need for all this stuff. 
Why not simply establish a connection to the server at validation time, have the server generate a file with all the parameters you want in it (in plain text even) and then have the server sign that file and return it to the software?
The client can read the file, and then simply validate te signature using one of the many digital signature algorithms that are out there.

"6150135","RSA decryption of valid data padded data fails (BadPaddingException)","I am facing a very peculiar problem when using RSA encryption/decryption in Java.
Example code:
KeyPairGenerator kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"");
kpg.initialize(2048);
KeyPair kp = kpg.genKeyPair();

Cipher enc = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");
enc.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, kp.getPublic());
String CipherText = new String(enc.doFinal(PlainText.getBytes()));
System.out.println(""CipherText: "") + CipherText);

Cipher dec = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");
dec.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, kp.getPrivate());
PlainText = new String(dec.doFinal(CipherText.getBytes()));
System.out.println(""PlainText: "" + PlainText);

As everyone can plainly see: I encrypt the plaintext using the public key, after which I decrypt the ciphertext using the private key.
This code crashes with the following message:
Exception in thread ""main"" javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Data must start with zero

I also tried to explicitly use ""RSA/ECB/NoPadding"", and this fails on decoding period. (Eg the decoded ciphertext doesn't match the original plaintext).
Last but not least, I have tried to perform this when using my own PKCS1.5 padding function ala the PKCS1.5 specs:
EMB = 00 || 02 || RD || 00 || MD
EMB is encoded messageblock of length k
Where RD are 8 random nonzero bytes
MD is max length k = 11, and optionally padded with zero bytes to make EMB length k.
After two days of testing I can only conclude that the RSA algo in Java is flawed or simply not performing what I expect it to perform.
Any suggestions or fixes to the above code are very welcome, as I am completely stumped on why the above code will not simply work as expected.
","Don't do this:
String CipherText = new String(enc.doFinal(PlainText.getBytes()));

Two reasons:

It's almost never a good idea to call String.getBytes() without specifying an encoding. Do you really want the result to depend on the system default encoding?
It's definitely never a good idea to treat the result of a binary encryption operation (i.e. opaque binary data) as an encoded string. Encode it in Base64 or hex instead.

You can use Apache Commons Codec to perform the base64 encode/decode operations, or this standalone public domain encoder/decoder.

"12959638","Secure login within Phonegap","I'm creating a Phonegap application which needs to allow a user to log into our Central Authentication Service.
My concern is that, since the files on the Phone are being loaded locally (via file://), there isn't security like there would be over an HTTPS connection. If I pass the username and password to an HTTPS location on our server, the request would not be secured even though the response would be.
I do not want to use a ChildBrowser plugin for the login because there doesn't appear to be any kind of event bubbling that would tell me when the login process has finished, and because not all platforms support the ChildBrowser plugin.
It looked as though it might be reasonable to use asymmetric encryption to encrypt the username/password combination with a public key and decrypt it on the server with a private key. I can't seem to get any javascript RSA libraries to play nice with Java on the backend, though.
Does asymmetric encryption seem decent for this case of protecting a user's password in a Phonegap application? Is there a better solution?
How would one get this working with Javascript -> Java? I've been using the ohdave.com/RSA scripts on the client side, but Java doesn't want to recreate a key using ohdave's generated keys. 
Any help is appreciated.
","I have since learned that requesting the authentication webservice via HTTPS will initiate a handshake that will allow the credentials to be encrypted with the SSL certificate.
As far as storing the credentials on the phone, here's how I'm doing it:

Send credentials to login webservice over SSL with Base64 encoding in an Basic Authorization header.
Successful login response includes credentials AES encrypted with a key that lives on the server.
AES Encrypted credentials are stored on the phone.
Future logins are handled by sending the encrypted credentials to the login webservice over SSL in a Digest Authorization header.

Authenticate something signed with the private key

It can not be used to decrypt something to encrypted by a private key.  Its for this reason that the Public/Private key system is refered to as an Asymetric system.

","Not in .NET.
In many traditional public-key encryption algorithm, like RSA, you can encrypt and decrypt both ways, typically one way is called ""encryption"" and the other ""signing"", even though you actually end up with an encrypted version of something both ways.
However, in .NET the RSA implementation has been crippled, and when signing will only produce digests of the input, not the full processed information.
It seems there's some disagreement about what can and cannot be done with RSA, so let me edit my answer to be more specific.
I'm talking about RSA math, not any particular RSA implementation.
RSA math allows you to encode information either of the two keys (private or public), and the encoded data can only be decoded with the other of the two keys.
Typically, you encode with a public key, encrypting the information, and decode it with the private key, decrypting the information. Or, you take a hash of the information, encode it with the private key, signing the hash, and decode the hash with the public key, in order to compare and verify the signature.
Typical implementations does not allow one to do full encoding of data from private to public, only by hashing the data, but the math behind RSA fully allows this.

","In RSA the only actual difference between a public key and a private key is which one you keep secret. 
So you can use a public key as the encryption key and decrypt with the private key, or use the private key as the encryption key and decrypt with the public key.

I'm a bit at a loss how to start this. Does anybody have a code snippet?
Also, encrypting / signing of the small string would ideally happen in PHP, since I want to offload that to a web server and all we have so far is your generic PHP/MySQL hosted website.
Use Case: I'm trying to come up with a lightweight licensing scheme for a software we are about to release to beta testers. Since the software will probably be freeware, all we really want to achieve is

know who has the software installed (email address)
let the software expire after a given period, after which the user will have to get a new license


this is as easy as filling out a form and waiting for an automated email with the key to arrive
we are trying to reduce the likelyhood of old versions coming back to bite our reputation / haunt us


Being able to encrypt a tuple (expiry date, fingerprint) and decrypt that at startup would make an easy licensing module: The first time the application is started, the user is asked for email address, name, organisation. This information is posted to the webserver along with an md5 fingerprint of some system info (nic, computer name, assembly major and minor version). The webserver answers by email (checks validity of email address) with an encrypted version of the tuple (expiry date, fingerprint) that is then saved to disk. On startup, this can be decrypted and compared with current date and regenerated fingerprint.
EDIT: OK, so I don't have all the answers to my question yet. But it looks like .NET won't make it easy to use the private key for encryption (if that is at all possible, the answers don't really agree on that).
The route I will take is this (based on my use case):

I will use the private key to sign the license.
I will use the public key to verify the license was signed by the private key
I will post another question aimed at PHP devs on how to use the .NET keys (produced by sn.exe) to sign some text
I am not really worried about the user seeing the license, as it is a hash anyway and computed from stuff he allready knows.

","This can be done using SignedXml http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229745.aspx. At a lower level you can prob use RSAPKCS1SignatureDeformatter and RSAPKCS1SignatureFormatter. These work by encrypting a hash of the data then comparing the data with the (decrypted) hash the other end. I believe the hashing is used because private key encryption can only handle small data. Not sure about reusing the assembly public key, if it is causing problems just use a separate key pair.
Word of warning, check out this as these classes can result in 20 second hang ups! http://www.pcreview.co.uk/forums/thread-3428177.php
This approach is vulnerable to the signature verification code being tampered with using Reflexil but that is another matter.
I wrote the following but rereading I think you already got this: You aren't really trying to encrypt or hide data from the user, you want to stop them from creating or tampering the license. You are right that a public private key encryption algorithm can be used for this. This is known as Signing using a private key (server side license generation). And verification of the signature using a public key (license checking in the app). I mention this terminology as it'll help with research.

I assume its not as simple as just base64 encode/decode the data and it needs a higher level of encryption.

In simple terms if i want to keep the data secure between users and my webserver what are some of the most common or accepted methods for C# to PHP?
The data goes directly from the app on the users PC to my server, i control source code for both but i myself and not the developer hence my lack of technical knowledge on the issue.
One C# developer i talked with suggested symmetric/asymmetric algorithm but he is not a PHP developer so he doesn't know if php can take that data and decrypt it.
","It seems you are concerned with the security of the data while being transferred from the client app to the server, and vice versa. As has been mentioned in the comments, an HTTPS connection will be sufficient in this regard. It automatically performs encryption/decryption for you.
To get an HTTPS connection working, you would purchase an SSL certificate (Namecheap is one website where you can buy one) and install it on your web server. The certificate is automatically installed on a user's local machine the first time he/she connects to the server, and each subsequent connection performs a check for a valid certificate. So basically, you just install the certificate on the server and don't have to worry about it until you have to renew your certificate. Just make sure that your client app attempts to connect to an HTTPS address instead of an HTTP.
If you were to implement symmetric/asymmetric encryption, it would help with encryption and decryption before and after the data is transferred. If you encrypt the data in your client app, you will have to decrypt it on the server side when you receive it, and vice versa. This would provide you with even stronger security; however, depending on the nature of your app, an HTTPS connection may be enough.
One of my personal projects is a client C# app that connects to a Ruby web server, which I also wrote. I installed an SSL certificate on my Ruby web server so that data is encrypted while in transit. In my case, the data being transferred does not contain any user data or PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and therefore does not pose a security risk if an external party gains access to this information. As such, I felt using encryption before and after transit was not worthwhile nor would provide any benefit to the end user. Again, this depends on the nature of your app and your users' expectations.
EDIT:
As mine mentioned in the comments, StartSSL offers free SSL certificates.

","To answer your further questions, when a server is issued and properly configured with a good cert, you shouldn't need to do anything more.
Using HTTPS
HTTPS works by verifying SSL certifications with a Certificate Authority (CA) during an initial handshake. Certificate Authorities, which is essentially a list of signatures that are used to verify said certs, usually come preloaded by an OS vendor.
Assuming your server has a CA issued certificate, all you will be required to do is change from using HTTP to HTTPS when making the connection. The library you're using should have a method of verifying the servers SSL cert, if it doesn't automatically do this for you.
There is no technical reason that you should have to encrypt anything that will being sent over HTTPS, so long as the certificate is strongly encrypted.
Also, if you would like to dig deeper into the nitty-gritty details of how HTTPS works, there's this very good post over on Information Security that sheds a little light on the inner workings of the protocol.
To answer your original question
For the sake of completeness.
PHP has the cryptography extension mcrypt which supports various algorithms and cipher operation modes. I've put together a simple example using AES 256 / PBKDF-SHA1 key decryption (along with the C# code to perform the encryption).
EDIT: I'd like to point out that hash_pbkdf2 is only available in PHP 5.5 and up. Support down to 5.3 can be added with this nifty trick.
PHP
function decode_aes($data, $key) // Decrypt custom format data string
{
    $iv_size = mcrypt_get_iv_size(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC);
    $salt_size = 16;

    $iv = substr($data, 0, $iv_size); // Init vector
    $salt = substr($data, $iv_size, $salt_size); // The salt
    $extact = substr($data, $iv_size + $salt_size); // This is the encrypted data

    $key = hash_pbkdf2(""sha1"", $key, $salt, 1000, 32, true); // Sets to use PBKDF-SHA1

    return mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, $key, $extact, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $iv); // Perform the decryption with the extracted sections
}

// As an example, I've included this.

"13588039","How can I use RSA to Encrypt/Decrypt ASP.Net Forms Authentication Ticket","Istead of using FormsAuthentication.Encrypt / FormsAuthentication.Decrypt, is it possible to use an existing RSA container in the machine key store to do the encryption/decryption of the ticket. 
The reason is that the ASP.Net application I'm developing is meant to be used in multiple load balanced servers. Hence I need to copy the machine key onto all web.config files in all the machines. Since we are already using Asymmetric Encryption (RSA) for another purpose, we have automated installing a common RSA key container in all the servers via a bat file and key container xml. Since this mechanism is in place I want to use the same RSA key container to encrypt/decrypt the forms auth ticket too.

Is this possible? If so how do I override the existing behaviour to achieve this.
If its possible then do you see any disadvantages of using RSA instead of the standard encryption?

","Yes, but it would require some work.
You will need to override/replace the standard authentication module that ships with .NET and replicate all the existing functionality with the exception of calls to the RSA Encrypt/Decrypt methods you want to use instead.
See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.security.formsauthentication.encrypt.aspx
You will also need to edit all the standard builtin login pages if you are using those.
As a template, inspect the source for the FormsAuthenticationTicket and you will see how the string is constructed that contains parameters such as UserID, Expiry Date etc, and then pass that string into the Encrypt method, which in turn is then used as the cookie value.
Your new auth module will then have to reverse that encryption and validate the user as before.
It's a fair amount of work for relatively little gain, depends on how badly you want to use RSA over the standard encryption methods used (they already offer some powerful encruyption methods right out the box see http://www.sourcetree.net/sourcetree/Development/Aspnet%20Examples/GenerateMachineKeyForWebConfig.aspx)

","Do not move encrypted data from a database to another. Technically is possible, true, but you will likely compromise the key in the process so I rather not tell you how to do it.
When data is exchanged between sites, the usual procedure separates the key management and deployment from data transfer. Data is decrypted before transfer and dedicate encryption schemes for data transfer are used, like TLS and SSL, that eliminate the problem of deploying and sharing the actual encryption keys.
Asa side note, normally one does no encrypt data with asymmetric keys. They are way too slow for data operations. What everybody does is they encrypt data with a symmetric key and then encrypt the symmetric key with an asymmetric key.

I would like to have asymmetric encryption using AES algorithm for iPhone application using Objective C. 
I have widely seen symmetric encryption using AES, so im not sure about the support for asymmetric encryption with AES. Kindly suggest me on this. 
","AES is a symmetric cipher. It can't simply be used an an asymmetric (i.e., public-key) capacity.
I am guessing the reason for your question is the issue of key exchange - such that you can establish an AES-encrypted connection without having to rely on a pre-shared key.
Numerous valid approaches exist, but I'll just hit on two:

Take a look at or Diffie-Hellman. You can get both sides of a connection to agree on a key without actually having to exchange that key. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie–Hellman_key_exchange
RSA. I'm a fan of Botan. It's free. It works. You can generate public/private key pairs on both sides, exchange the public keys, then securely exchange private keys, and then start AES. http://botan.randombit.net/pubkey.html

As always, this advice needs to be accompanied with a warning: it's very easy to do this incorrectly and largely (or entirely) thwart your security efforts. Tread carefully.

The scenario is this: I have a public *.asc key file. I want to use this file (not my personal keyring) to encrypt data on a server, so that I can decrypt it locally with a secret key.
From the command line I can achieve this using gpg, but I'd prefer to use a Ruby library that isn't just a wrapper around the CLI (i.e., presumably one that provides bindings to the C library). I've looked at the GPGME and OpenPGP gems and haven't been able to figure out how to use them. The documentation (especially for OpenPGP) is quite sparse.
Here, for example, is something I've tried using GPGME, without any luck:
key = GPGME::Data.new(File.open(path_to_file))
data = GPGME::Data.new(""I want to encrypt this string."")

# Raises GPGME::Error::InvalidValue
GPGME::Ctx.new do |ctx|

","I believe I've now got this figured out. It was actually just a few simple pieces I was missing:

Initializing the GPGME::Ctx object with a keylist_mode of GPGME::KEYLIST_MODE_EXTERN.
Importing the public key file using GPGME::Ctx#import.
Using GPGME::Crypto#encrypt to perform the encryption and specifying the correct recipient.

So my solution now looks like this:
key = GPGME::Data.new(File.open(path_to_file))
data = GPGME::Data.new(""I want to encrypt this string."")

GPGME::Ctx.new(GPGME::KEYLIST_MODE_EXTERN) do |ctx|
  ctx.import(key)
  crypto = GPGME::Crypto.new(:armor => true, :always_trust => true)
  e = crypto.encrypt(data, :recipients => ""recipient@domain.com"")

I'm not sure what part you are struggling with.
In short, the asymmetric algorithm is used for symmetric key exchange.
The symmetric algorithm is used for the bulk data (stream/block) crypto. You won't get it done with simply modifying your 2 functions, you will need to implement a handshake and key exchange.
Since you have an MVC.NET app, you can host it within a web server and gain HTTPS/SSL transport. You can also do the same with WCF. Any reason why aren't using what is provided by the underlying transport? You can even configure your application (web.config) to require client certificates.
PS: I agree about not re-inventing the wheel, even Microsoft's article that Erik linked to provides a warning about it.

Caution We recommend that you do not attempt to create your own key exchange method from the basic functionality provided, because many details of the operation must be performed carefully in order for the key exchange to be successful.

"15203788","Create asymmetric key from a passphrase","I want to allow users on my site to create an asymmetric private & public key so they can:

upload the public key to the site so my web application can encrypt
files they upload 
download files and decrypt them using a local
application and the private key

My issue is that if the users machine dies then they will most likely loose their private key.
My concept is that the application the users download to pull the files from the site will also allow them to generate the keys for use on the site.
So my question is, Is it possible to create an asymmetric private/public key pair based on a passphrase? This would allow the user to regenerate the private key if required.
","What the fields are for your algorithm (e.g. RSA http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.rsaparameters.aspx) are more or less up to you.  You could easily create an algorithm to generate D and P from some string (calculating the other RSA fields from those).  I'd really recommend you wouldn't pick one from an answer on StackOverflow though (that would simply give someone who wanted to get at your data something easy to try).
The reason algorithms like RSA are hard to break is the amount of effort that goes into reverse engineering the private/public key based on the encrypted data.  If you introduce a ""shortcut"" like a reproducible generation algorithm based on a passphrase, the security of your system now depends on how well the passphrase is kept secret, not the encryption algorithm itself.
The same is true for the private key; which is why many organizations don't store the private key on hard drives and store them on secure external devices protected by a password or some biometric information.
I'd recommend you do not generate keys from a passphrase and simply use recommended practices for storing and protecting your private key.

","One way to do exactly what you are asking is:

Define a security level N, the larger the more secure but slower this process will be.
Generate a ""salt"" and associate it with the user's id.
Since RSA key generation requires a secure random number generator, use the user's password and salt with PBKDF2, starting at iteration N, to generate secure random data.

This process should deterministically generate a public/private RSA key pair. However, the reasons not to do this are:

It was cooked up by me and, AFAIK, this post is the first time this process will be publicly vetted.
It is not known to me if PBKDF2 actually works as a secure random number generator for use with RSA.
It may or may not be true the PBKDF2 is guaranteed to generate a data from which a public/private RSA key pair will originate.
In practice, while this does work, it takes a very long time and the time it takes is based on the user's password, which is a user experience and security exposure point that needs considered.

A better way to accomplish what you are trying to do is:

Define a security level N, the larger the more secure but slower this process will be.
Generate a ""salt"" and associate it with the user's id.
Generate an RSA public / private key pair.
Iterate PBKDF2 N times to create a symmetric key based on the user's password and salt.
Use a symmetric encryption algorithm to encrypt the private key.
Upload the unencrypted public key and encrypted private key to the server.

This is better because:

All processes listed above are, AFAIK, standard and vetted.
Generation of public / private keys (time consuming) only occurs once while setting up the user's account.
Accessing the keys always occurs in a fixed amount of time.

This solves your problem:

Since the server only has the encrypted private key it cannot decrypt the user's data.
If the client machine dies the server can re-issue the private key.

Of course there are the obvious warnings like if the user forgets their password all their data is locked until public knowledge on how to crack RSA is available or a billion years of current computing power is put to the task of breaking their password ;-) (depending on N and key size of course). Also, the salt is important to prevent dictionary attacks.

","To get started, you'll need the private key to decrypt the message. By ""public key (64 bit encoded)"", I'm guessing what you really have is a Base-64–encoded certificate, with a header line that says ""----- BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----"" and a footer that says ""-----END CERTIFICATE-----"".
If that's correct, you'll need to find the private key. This is sometimes stored in a PKCS #12 format file, with a "".p12"" or "".pfx"" extension. You'll need a password to access the private key if it is stored in such a file.
Alternatively, OpenSSL and other utilities use private key files that can be Base-64–encoded or binary. These have a variety of extensions, and may or may not be password-protected. If the file that you have has a header line of ""-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"" or ""-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----"", that is actually the private key.
Finally, Windows can store private keys in its internal key store. 
When you clarify the location of the private key, please update your question.

If the private key is used on the Java side, it may be an attempt to perform a digital signature. While all of several Java providers I've tested produce correct results when (ab)used this way, if you are doing a signature, the Signature class should be used. The C# code should use a signature object to ""verify"" the signature as well. 
Encryption is performed with the private key. Since the public key is public, anyone can decrypt the message; i.e., the message is not confidential. Public keys are used by recipients to verify signed messages.

","With most public implementations of RSA it would not be possible. The decryption routine expects the plaintext to be in a specific format (i. e. properly padded) and fails if it's not. Again, on encryption it would apply padding to the plaintext, instead of using the blob as it is.
/*
The math of RSA allows for that, AFAIK, as long as the moduli of the two keys are coprime (which is true almost always). But you'll probably have to roll your own implementation.
*/
Another problem is that the numeric value of the plaintext block should be smaller than the modulus. So the modulus of the first key should be smaller than that of the second key, otherwise no guarantee that the first cyphertext would be a proper plaintext for the second encryption round.
OpenSSL has, I vaguely recall, a no-padding mode. You might have some luck with that.
EDIT: in general, coming up with your own cryptographic primitives is a bad idea in 99.9% cases. If your interest is purely academic, then be my guest; but if you're after a specific piece of applied functionality (i. e. encrypt something so that the consent of two nontrusting parties is needed to decrypt), then you're definitely on the wrong track.
EDIT2: the math of RSA allows for that if the moduli are identical. Scratch paragraph two. But having two keys share the same modulus compromises security very much. If Alice has private key (m, d) and Cindy as private key (m, d') - assuming same m - then Alice can determine d' in O(m) time, given a single plaintext/cyphertext pair from Cindy. Not good.

","In most cases you can't change the order of the decryption.
Schemes that allow to reorder decryption are called commutative cryptosystems.
One public key cryptosystem that can be used to build a commutative cryptosystem is
the ElGamal encryption. 
Here is just the main idea: Assume g is a generator of
a suitable group G, for which computing discrete logarithms is hard.
Let xA and xB be two private keys,
hA = g xA , and
hB = g xB 
be the corresponding public keys. Both keys pairs use the same group
G (i.e. the same modulus p if we use G = Z/(p)). It is one advantage of the
ElGamal scheme that it still is secure if two users share the same group (or modulus).
RSA on the other hand will be insecure.
Encrypting a message m with hA gives the ciphertext

(m hAr, gr).

Note that knowing the secret key xA allows to decrypt because

(gr)xA = hAr

To encrypt the ciphertext a second time one would first re-encrypt the existing
ciphertext with A's public key. 
He chooses a random r' and computes

(m hAr hAr', grgr') =
  (m hAr+r', gr+r').

The result is just another valid encryption with A's public key.
This re-encryption is necessary to avoid an attack that works for example 
against RSA with equal modulus as shown below. 
Next, one would encrypt with B's public key giving 

(m hAr+r' hBs, gr+r', gs).

Decryption is possible in either order, e.g. knowing xA allows to compute

(gr+r')xA = hAr+r'

and hence one can compute

(m hBs, gs),

which is just what we want: an encryption of m with B's public key.
There are a number of subtleties that need to be observed to get a secure implementation.
And getting this right isn't easy. 
For more info see for example the Phd of Stephen Weis, which contains a chapter on commutative encryption.

There are a number of problems if the same idea is tried with ""textbook RSA"". First to make the encryption commutative it is necessary that both users A and B share the same modulus.
E.g. A uses (n, eA, dA) and B uses (n, eB, dB), where n is the modulus, eA, eB the public keys and dA, dB the secret keys. However, knowing for example (n, eA, dA) allows to factor n, and hence compute B's secret key, which is of course one big flaw.
Now we could encrypt m as

meA mod n,

encrypt again as

meAeB mod n,

decrypt with A's secret key giving

meB mod n,

and decrypt again with B's secret key to get m. That looks fine until one notices that 
an attacker who can intercept the two ciphertexts c = meA mod n and c' = meB mod n can use Euclid's algorithm to find r,s such that

r eA + s eB = 1 

and then compute

m = cr (c')s mod n.

The idea also works against the solution using RC4 proposed in another answer. Weis's thesis contains a detailed description of the attack.

Some advantages of completely avoiding the JCE and using the Bouncycastle lightweight API (BC LWAPI) exclusively are:

No additional policy files are needed to make any of the cryptography work. E.g. you can use AES-256 without requiring users to download the unlimited jurisdiction policy files.
The BC LWAPI is supported on the JME (formerly J2ME) environment. The JCE is not.

... no mention is made of seeding when the EVP functions are used

The EVP functions use whatever generator is in use for the library. It could be md_rand or a FIPS AES/CTR generator. There's nothing special to get random numbers for the EVP functions (as opposed to other functions).


May I assume that the seeding is done internally for me in the higher-level EVP functions?

Yes, if you did not seed the generator yourself. If you seeded the generator and there's sufficient entropy, then it will not auto-seed itself.
You should avoid allowing the generator to auto-seed itself. See the OpenSSL wiki page Random Numbers for the details.
There's nothing special about seeding/auto-seeding a generator when using EVP interfaces. Whatever you do applies to everything.


If I do need to do it then which functions must I have a look at?

The OpenSSL wiki page Random Numbers provides more details, but you should do something like:
int rc = RAND_load_file(""/dev/urandom"", 32);
if(rc != 32) {
    /* RAND_load_file failed */
}

/* OK to proceed */

You want to avoid a direct call to RAND_poll, and you want to avoid auto-seeding (which calls RAND_poll internally).

","To put it a little more explicitly, 'encryption with a private key' means that to decrypt you need to use the public key. This isn't an issue, except that anyone can then decrypt your [insert item here], since the public key is just that: public. It isn't useful to protect data, this system is used to verify data.
For instance, Alice wants to send a file toBob (yea, yea, shoot me). Alice doesn't care if anyone else can read her file, it's not confidential, but she wants Bob to be sure that what she sent is what he recieved. She can then encrypt her file with her private key, and Bob can decrypt the file on his end with her public key, ensuring that the file hasn't been tampered with. But if someone else is listening in to the transaction, they can also decrypt and read the file. They just can't change it.

For the case you provide, a better way would be exchanging keys when they meet so that there are actually two keypairs. You yourself mentioned that RSA in particular doesn't actually workr if you try to encrypt with the public key because of optimisations made in the algorithm. I wouldn't be entirely surprised if this is a common case with other algorithms. They are designed to be run one way (private/encrypt, public/decrypt) and are a known ""expensive"" operation, therefore they likely to be heavily optimised in reality.
Other than that, I don't see any security concerns with your plan... As long as the keys are truely kept private. Private/public are just common names based on typical usage. There's nothing forcing you to make a public key fully public. In your case you may like to term them 'encryption key' and 'decryption key', but I wouldn't use each key for both. Infact, I'd recommend you did term them such inside your program, for the reasons given by Jonathan Leffler in his comments: 

A 'public key' is something that can be shared by multiple people. That's the definition of 'public key'. Anything else is very confusing

Signature and Encryption are two different prototypes with different
security requirements that among other require different padding
modes. Use phrase ""decrypt with public"" key was the biggest obuse of
terminology in history of cryptography that was widespread by Bruce
Schneier's book ""Applied Cryptography"". The phrase it self were
supposed to be used to describe signature schemes with message
recovery (such as RSA). This phrase was also used to adjust asymmetric
encryption and signature to old protocol verification models such as
BAN. However, by it self this is just a missnomer - public key is
known to everybody and decrypt operation has meaning of providing
privacy to the content - which is impossible if decryption key is
known to everyone.

Even so raw RSA allows interchange of public and private key, but in
reality they can't be interchanged. Private key decryption is
implemented with using CRT (chinese remainder theorem) to provide 4x
better performance of private key operation. For that - you need not
only exponent, but also factorization of modulus and multiplicative
inverses of some product these factors. Public key has only modulus
and exponent and can't be used with such calculation.

","You're misusing the terms here.
If the keys are truly private and public, then yes, anything encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted by the public key, but if the key is truly public, anyone can decrypt that.
Let's disregard that.
The problem here is what Bob knows. Does Bob actually know if Alice sent her public key to anyone else? If not, he can not ensure that only he can decrypt the message. There is nothing in the technology that ensures this. Anything encrypted by Alices private key can be decrypted by her public key, and thus by anyone in possession of that key. By the very nature of public keys, that should be anyone.
The only way to ensure that a message for Bob is only decryptable by Bob is for Bob to give Alice his public key, and make Alice encrypt everything she wants to send to Bob by his public key, which will make the data un-decryptable by anyone except Bob. Whether she also encrypts the same data by her private key (ie. signs the data) is besides the point.
Of course, again, Bob, cannot know that Alice did not send the exact same message to anyone else, encrypting it for others public keys.

In standard use of asymmetrical cryptographic system, encryption is done with public key, decryption with private key.

It depends on who is doing what.  Suppose Alice wants to send a message to Bob that only Bob can decode.   Alice encrypts the message using Bob's public key (under the standard definition of 'public key', meaning the one that is known to people other than its owner).  Now only someone who knows Bob's private key (presumably, the only person who knows Bob's private key is in fact Bob) can decrypt Alice's message to Bob.
If Alice wants Bob to know that only she could have sent it, she can encrypt the message with her own private key, assuming Bob knows her public key, either before or after encrypting the message with Bob's public key.  Let's assume she encrypts the message with her private key, then the result with Bob's public key.  To read the message, Bob has to decrypt the message with his (Bob's) private key, and then decrypt the result again with Alice's public key.  If what he reads is now sensible text, he knows that someone who knows both Alice's private key (presumably Alice) and his public key (could be anyone at all) sent the message.
In practice, the asymmetric algorithms are expensive to compute, so what you really do is choose a random session key of an appropriate length and an agreed upon standard symmetric encryption algorithm such as AES.  Then the main message is encrypted with the (relatively fast) symmetric algorithm and sent as one part of the message.  The other part of the message is the encrypted - or doubly encrypted - random session key.  Bob can decrypt the session key section of the message to obtain the session key; he then uses that to decrypt the main part of the message.
Note that if you are sending a message to many people, you can use one encryption of the message proper, and then encrypt the session key once for each recipient, using the recipient's public key.  Each recipient can only decrypt the session key information using the key that belongs to them, but all can actually decrypt it.  If the message is substantial (say 2 MB of PDF), then this is much more economical than separately encrypting the message with each recipients public key.

Inversing the process, ""encryption with private key"" is called ""signing"".

No; signing is a separate operation.  If you read Schneier's ""Practical Cryptography"", you'll see that the authors suggest using one public/private key pair for encryption, and a second pair for signature work.  For example, a signature encrypts a fixed length hash of the original message using the private key from the signing key.  Anybody who knows the public key part of the signing key can then decrypt the signature to obtain the hash of the original message.  Presumably, the same recipient can also decrypt the message (using the public key of the signature key pair), and then can check that the hash of the message received matches the hash derived from the signature.  Any mismatch indicates a problem and the message should be discarded.
There are many ways to do these things - depending on the security requirements.
But the basic point is that one person knows the private key of an asymmetric key, and potentially many people know the public part of the asymmetric key (and this is perfectly safe).  Data can be encrypted by the sender using the recipients public key; it may also be encrypted by the sender using their own private key.  The recipient can decrypt the received message using their own private key and, if necessary, using the sender's public key.

The question, even as amended at about 2009-09-05T13:00-07:00, is not completely coherent, IMNSHO.
You should read chapter 13 ""RSA"" in ""Practical Cryptography"" (probably after reading some of the earlier chapters too - most notably section 3.3 Public-Key Encryption).
Notation for Encryption and Decryption
Let's define a bit of notation for discussing orthodox public key cryptography.  Let's start with basic symmetric encryption:

C = E(K,m) is the encrypted message (cipher text, C) generated by encryption algorithm E using key K on (plain text) message m.
P = D(K,C) is the plain text message (plain text, P) discovered by decryption algorith D using key K on (encrypted) message c.
To be a working system, m = P, so D(K,E(K,m)) = m.

So far, this notation applies to symmetric encryption because the same value K is used in both encryption and decryption.  Anyone who knows K (and the algorithm, but Kerckhoff's Principle that 'secrecy is in the keys' means that you assume the attackers know the algorithm - any contrary assumption is cryptographic 'snake oil') can decrypt the message.
With an asymmetric encryption system, Ea and Da are the encryption and decryption methods for algorithm A.  The key distinguishing feature of an asymmetric cryptographic cipher is that the key Kencrypt used by Ea is different from the key Kdecrypt used by Da.  Further, to be practical, it must be computationally infeasible to deduce Kdecrypt even if you know Kencrypt and vice versa.
With asymmetric encryption, Alice creates a pair of keys, (Salice, Palice).  Conventionally, Salice is the secret key and Palice is the public key.  Note that Alice knows both keys.  All that matters is:

Salice and Palice are different.
Alice does not let anyone else know about one of the keys (Salice); it is crucial that this information is not known to anyone else.
Alice can let other people know about the other key (Palice) without compromising the security of the system.

Similarly, Bob will create a pair of keys, (Sbob, Pbob).  Note that:

Bob knows the keys Sbob, Pbob, and Palice.
Alice knows the keys Salice, Palice, and Pbob.

Alice sends a message to Bob
Now, when Alice wants to send a message, Malice-bob, to Bob so that Bob can read it (but no-one else can), she has to encrypt it with Bob's key Pbob.  So, she creates a message:

Calice-bob = Ea(Pbob, Malice-bob)

Bob knows (from external evidence) that the message was encrypted with Pbob, so he knows that he must decrypt it with Sbob:

Malice-bob = Da(Sbob, Calice-bob)

However, at this point, all he knows about the message is that it came from someone who knew his Pbob key.  He does not know that it came from Alice except via extrinsic evidence.
If Bob and Alice agree that their messages must be encrypted such that they are both confident that the message received came from the other, then both must be confident that no-one other than Alice knows Salice and that no-one other than Bob knows Sbob.  They must also be confident that Palice is known to Bob and Bob must be confident that Palice really does belong to Alice, and that Pbob is known to Alice and Alice must be confident that Pbob really does belong to Bob.  Establishing these trust relationships is a lot of what PKI (public key infrastructure) is about.
Assuming that these criteria are met, then Alice can send her message to Bob in such a way that Bob is confident that only Alice could have sent it.  As outlined previously, the mechanism is a double encryption:

C1alice-bob = Ea(Salice,Malice-bob)
C2alice-bob = Ea(Pbob,C1alice-bob)

Alice sends C2alice-bob to Bob (along with some signature or MAC to confirm that it was not corrupted in transit), and then Bob computes:

D1alice-bob = Da(Sbob,C2alice-bob)
D2alice-bob = Da(Palice,D1alice-bob)

If everything has gone according to plan, D2alice-bob = Malice-bob.
Mechanics of RSA Key Pairs
The RSA encryption algorithm is based on the fact that if you have two publicly known numbers (which are two parts of one public key), the exponent e and the modulus n, then given a message m, it is easy to compute c = me mod n.  However, it is computationally infeasible to deduce m given just c (and e and n).  If, however, you know another exponent, d, then you can magically calculate r = cd mod n, and r = m if you have computed e, d and n appropriately.  It is not feasible to compute d from e and n without knowing some other information.
Under the RSA encryption scheme, you start work with two (large) randomly determined prime numbers, p and q, and their product is n.  The RSA algorithm is predicated on the fact that it is extremely difficult to factor n (determine p and q given just n); if anyone ever finds an easy way of factoring large numbers, then the RSA algorithm is instantly broken.
Once you have n, you need to determine exponents e and d such that:

ed = 1 mod t where t = LCM(p-1, q-1), and LCM is the least common multiple.

You can choose one of the two values as a small odd number - Schneier and Ferguson suggest e = 3, for example.  You then calculate d using some computations that they cover in about 6 pages of their book.  Typically, d will be a rather large number.  You can then publish the pair (e, n) as the composite public key, keeping the values (p, q, t, d) secret as the private key.  Given e and n, it is not computationally feasible to deduce d without first factoring n.  ""Practical Cryptography"" suggests using two different pairs (e1, d1) and (e2, d2), derived from the same value n, where you use e1 to encrypt messages, and e2 for digital signatures; they even suggest using the values 3 and 5 for these.

OpenSSL and Key Generation
Your description of how the RSA keys are generated by OpenSSL is confused, I believe.
The generation process first has to generate to large random prime numbers, p and q in the notation above.  There are stochastic methods for determining whether a given large number is (probably) prime; it takes a little while to compute two such prime numbers.  Taken together, these are used to compute first n, and then d (assuming e is established by some convention).  The two stages you see in OpenSSL are determining n, and then determining d.

Dissection of User Case
The question says:

Consider that Alice wants to send to Bob some stuff in a non-traditional way:
Alice and Bob once met and Alice gave Bob a ""public key"" generated from a private key she created BUT she warned Bob to keep it secret. AND she kept secret the private key, and didn't ever give to anyone else the public key.

So far, so good. The 'public key' isn't very public, but there's no harm in that.

Could Bob be sure that messages he receives from Alice (provided these are encrypted by Alice private key) are only readable by him (provided he really kept his copy of Alice's public key secret)?

If the encryption technology is of any use, then yes; only Alice and Bob can read the message that Alice encrypted with her secret key because only Alice and Bob know the public key that goes with her secret key.

And how compares this encryption solidity to the traditional way, which would, in our case, be Bob sending messages (encrypted by the public key of Alice) to Alice?

Confusion: the section started by discussing Alice sending messages to Bob; now you've switched to Bob sending messages to Alice.
When Bob and Alice met, Alice gave Bob her Palice public key.  Presumably, Bob also gave Alice his Pbob public key.  And both public keys have very limited public circulation - that's good, but not crucial to the security of the system.
Now, when Bob wants to send a message to Alice, he can encrypt it with her Palice public key, and Alice (and only Alice) can decrypt the message using her Salice secret key.  Alternatively, Bob could encrypt the message with his Sbob secret key, and Alice could decrypt it with Bob's Pbob public key.  Both sets of encryption and decryption would work.

What the question is about
The fact that asymmetrical keys are named ""private"" and ""public"" doesn't help understanding my question. Keys have underlying properties, and it's me broadcasting the ""public key"" that gives it its ""public"" property. Please make this distinction clear before answering: I'm not considering the ""public"" and ""private"" properties of these keys but the solidity of the ""private key"" encryption versus ""public key"" encryption.

It is equally reliable to encrypt with the correct private key and decrypt with the correct public key as it is to encrypt with the correct public key and decrypt with the correct private key.  The difference is in who can do which operation.  If you understand clearly who is doing the encrypting and who is doing the decrypting, and who knows which keys, then the secrecy of the methods become fairly clear.

I cannot use another terminology even if it is misleading in this special case.

Well, the 'public keys' in your case are not all that widely known, but that's all that's unusual about it.

I know that this case is non-traditional, and could lead to several inconsistency, or is not the point of the asymmetrical crypto systems as Bob and Alice here share some sort of a common secret and that's not the point of asymmetrical crypto.

The whole point of asymmetric encryption schemes is that it does not matter whether the attackers (classically called Eve, the eavesdropper) knows the public key.  As long as the private keys are kept private by Alice and Bob, the messages can be sent securely.  However, you must understand that if Alice sends a message to Bob that is encrypted only by Alice's secret key, then anyone (such as Eve) who knows Alice's public key can read the message.  Eve can't create a fake message that purports to come from Alice unless she also knows the secret key - if Eve discovers Alice's secret key, Eve can pretend to be Alice at any time she likes.  But she can read it.  If Alice sends a message to Bob that is encrypted only by Bob's public key, then only Bob can read the message (using his secret key), but Bob has no way of knowing whether it actually came from Alice or whether Eve sent it pretending to be Alice.  That's why you have to work hard to ensure that Bob knows that only Alice could have sent the message, and Alice knows that only Bob can read the message.

","I think that you are missing the point of public/private key encryption (at least as I understand it).
In the situation you have, symmetric encryption would work just as well. The reason to use non symmetric encryption is a matter of scale.
Say you have, not just Bob and Alice, but imaginary people for every letter of the alphabet. These people want to be able to send messages to anyone, ensuring sure that only the recipient can read it. Using a normal, symmetric encryption, this would require a shared key between every person, so if we have the 26 people from the alphabet town, that is 26x25 keys, with every person having to remember and secure 25 secret keys.
Enter symmetric (aka public/private key) encryption. Now every person has a private key, and a public key, with the normal rules. To send a message to Fred, you look up his (and there is only one) public key. Then you send him the message. Only Fred can read this message. In this scheme, you have 26x2 keys, and each person only needs to remember and secure 1 secret key. There also needs to be a source of public keys, but this is easy.
Using asymmetric encryption the way you describe, with a pair of keys for every set of people, would then require 26x25x2 keys.
So again, it is about scalability. The number of keys needed for symmetric schemes is N^2-N, where in asymmetric schemes, it is only 2*N.

","Using openssl rsa to dump the key contents reveals that the private and public keys you posted above have a different modulus.  For a matching keypair, the modulus would be identical in the private and public keys.  In other words, you definately mixed up different keys there.
To detect this, OpenSSL proper has the RSA_check_key() function to check whether an RSA keypair is usable, but the PHP wrapper for OpenSSL does not seem to expose that function to the user.

"12301485","RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider implementation vs RSACryptoServiceProvider c#","If RSACryptoServiceProvider cannot Encrypt data larger than it's KeySize, how RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider is implemented in the .Net framework?
I am working on a utility that is going to be used to encrypt/decrypt some sensitive information. My two encryption provider options are DPAPI and RSA, while DPAPI not suited for web farm kind of environment, RSA is fits because of the Export/Import options with a KeyContainer. This is a stand alone application running on a workstation.
As I am aware that Asymmetric algorithms are not designed for large data, I just tried encrypting a string of length over 400K using the code below and it works well.
        if (!section.SectionInformation.IsProtected)
        {
            section.SectionInformation.ProtectSection(""RSAProtectedConfigurationProvider"");
            section.SectionInformation.ForceSave = true;
            config.Save(ConfigurationSaveMode.Full);
        }

Definitely this implies that more things are happening behind the scenes apart from the export import key options in aspnet_regiis.exe. 
My understanding:

we encrypt myapp.exe.config with RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider, provide a key container name myrsakeycontainer, and export the public and private keys to an xml file myrsakeyfile.xml.
If we want myapp.exe.config to be decrypted in another computer, we import they keypair from myrsakeyfile.xml with a container named myrsakeycontainer.

this works well. I can achieve the same thing in my project via RSACryptoServiceProvider. But I can't handle data that larger than the key size that 
  new RSACryptoServiceProvider(cspParameters)
generated for me.

I want to be able to decrypt huge data (just in case) just the way
RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider does.
Yes I could use a RijndaelManaged (my favorite) for actual 
encryption and for the symmetric key transport (export/import) I
could use the RSACryptoServiceProvider. This leaves me in a
situation that If I want to export/import the symmetric key, I should
first encrypt it with the public key or RSA, import it to another
machine, decrypt with the private key of RSA. Which is export the RSA
key pair along with the encrypted symmetric key. 
But, when I export RSA key pair used by
RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider via aspnet_regiis.exe, I
believe that it exports only the public/private key pair in an xml
file and no other information (like the symmetric key information).
So, with just the RSA key pair, how does
RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider manage to derypt (huge - over
400K chars in my case) information that was encrypted on another
computer? In cases it uses a symmetric algorithm (perhaps?!) to
encrypt information, how is that symmetric key exported/imported to another
computer for decryption? Is that symmetric key part of the RSA key container exported via aspnet_regiis.exe or is the symmetric key is contrived dynamic based on an algorithm?
I could get away with a Rijndael, whose key is encrypeted with an RSA
key pair and I can export/import both the RSA key pair and the
Rijndael symmetric key to another computer. (which I have done in the past)
I am interested to know what is used inside
RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider. 

Any theories? concepts? links? recommendations? please..

Similar Question - What algorithms are used by RSAProtectedConfigurationProvider in web.config encyrption?

","The encrypted symmetric key is stored in the XML alongside the encrypted configuration information that the symmetric key has encrypted.
If you use Reflector to look at the code, what it does is load the XML node and use the asymmetric RSA private key to decrypt a symmetric key stored within the XML node itself.
The function that actually does this magic is here:
public virtual SymmetricAlgorithm GetDecryptionKey(EncryptedData encryptedData, string symmetricAlgorithmUri);

","When using asymmetric encryption you NEVER send the private key to the receiver. The receiver has your public key to encrypt your message encrypted with your private key.
Other way could be that you encrypt with the receivers public key and only he can decrypt the message with his private key.
So asymmetric encryption means to NEVER give your private key of hand.

-- Create key (at some earlier point)
create symmetric key sk_user_profile with algorithm = aes_192 encryption by password = 'P@ssword!!';

-- Now encrypt the contents
-- open the key so that we can use it
open symmetric key sk_user_profile decryption by password = 'P@ssword!!';

UPDATE users
SET password_enc = encryptbykey(key_guid('sk_user_profile'), password_plain, 1, user_id)

close symmetric key sk_user_profile

Now if I want to select the data, I still have to re-open the key with
open symmetric key sk_user_profile decryption by password = 'P@ssword!!';

Which is defeating the point isn't it, as I am embedding a plain-text password within a stored procedure.
Some questions

Is there any way around this - i.e. creating a certificate with this password and then referring to the certificate instead?
Would this certificate have to be purchased (like SSL), or can I create my own?
Is this method scalable across fail-over clustered databases, i.e. the encryption is not based on the machine, only the password provided. Therefore failover can still read the passwords

Thanks for your help
","Basically what you need to do is this:
create certificate MyEncryptionCertificate with subject = 'MyCertificate'

create symmetric key MySymmetricKey with algorithm = aes_256 encryption by certificate MyEncryptionCertificate

open symmetric key MySymmetricKey decryption by certificate MyEncryptionCertificate

select encryptbykey(key_guid('MySymmetricKey'), 'tada')) EncryptedMessage

let symKey = aesData.key + "":::"" + aesData.iv;
let msg = aesData.toString();

let rsa = new JSEncrypt();
rsa.setPublicKey( pub );
let cryptKey = rsa.encrypt( symKey );

//I'm passing the data through a hidden form field
$(""#key"").val(cryptKey + "":::"" + msg);

PHP decryption code:
$key = openssl_get_privatekey( file_get_contents( $_SERVER[""PRIV_KEY""]) );
$encryptedKey = explode( "":::"", $msg )[0];
$realMsg = base64_decode(explode( "":::"", $msg )[1]);

openssl_open($realMsg, $decrypted, $encryptedKey, $key);
return $decrypted;

The code above outputs nothing because the openssl_open call fails (returns false). When I base 64 decode the $encryptedKey variable, I get:
�vEi���pΕ��d_���@����욲JE��

but the symmetric key changes every time, so the output changes every time as well. Like I said, I've tried different encoding combinations, but they all return similar nonsense. As the JS code shows, I've encrypted the message ""test"".
I've never implemented encryption before, so I might be way off the mark here, but after staring at this code for days, any insight would be appreciated.
Edit: I'm having problems decrypting with my private key in PHP, not with the symmetric key
","Figured it out!!! So, I found out that PHP has a function to decrypt without needing an envelope called openssl_private_decrypt that uses a private key to decrypt a message. By using that function and base 64 decoding the encrypted key, I am able to decrypt the symmetric key on the server side and will hopefully be able to decrypt the message symmetrically now. For those interested, my code on the server side is:
$key = openssl_get_privatekey( file_get_contents( $_SERVER['PRIV_KEY'] ) );
$encryptedKey = base64_decode(explode( "":::"", $msg )[0]);

if( openssl_private_decrypt($encryptedKey, $decrypted, $key) )
{
    return $decrypted;
}
return $encryptedKey;

And on the client side, my code is the same as it was above. Hope this helps someone!

I am assuming RSA for the keys generation, encryption and decryption but if it's easier to do with another scheme feel free to comment.
","Hmm, interesting.
You're referring to RSA, I assume?
FYI, RSA isn't actually used to encrypt documents. It's used to exchange keys (keys for a symmetric algorithm, like AES).
So what you're really talking about is an approach that changes the keys.
Technically (mathmatically) if you put a different number in, you'll get a different number out. So that's not an issue; changing the public key in some fashion will (assuming you convince your RSA implementation to use it, or prepare an appropriately different number) result in a different symmetric key, thus an undecryptable document by Bob (because he'll expect a different key).
Really, though, I'm not so sure you care about this. It's a fairly useless thing to do. Perhaps, however, you're actually interested in Key Splitting (or ""Secret Sharing"" as wikipedia seems to call it).
HTH. I'm by no means an expert.

","As silky implies in his answer, the way in which RSA is usually used to encrypt a document is in combination with a symmetric algorithm, like AES.  A secure random key is generated for the AES algorithm, the documented is encrypted with that AES key, and the AES key is encrypted with the recipient's public key.  Both parts are supplied to the recipient.
You can adapt this to your situation simply by sending only the document encrypted with the AES key in the first step, and withholding the AES key encrypted with the recipient's public key until the second step.  The first part will be on the order of the original file size, and the second part will be a small, constant size (on the order of the RSA key size).

","(I assume you talk about RSA.)
Yes it is possible, but not 100%.
The public key is a part of the private key. It contains the modulus and the exponent of the key. 
You can completely forget changing the modulus, because you would have to generate a new rsa keypair, which is the same problem as the one we are trying to solve.
But it is possible to change the exponent. You can select any (prime) number between 1 and your exponent as the new exponent and hope that it is coprime with the totient. Without knowing the totient it's impossible to select always a correct exponent. To find out the totient you would have to know the prime factors of the key, which means that you would have to break the key (have fun!).
So, it's actually impossible to have a 100% percent working method to do that, at least not while knowing only the public key.
If you need more information about the theory check here

","I hope my idea works. 
Let us assume that (e,d,n) is a tuple of the RSA public exponent. The RSA private exponent and the RSA modulus n :
Select a prime number, say p,  between 1 and a 256 bit integer.
To encrypt a message m, compute the new public exponent as e*p and the ciphertext as: 
c= m^{e*p} mod n. 
To decrypt, the receiver should know the prime p, so you send this p later to him, with this he computes 
(1) P = p^{-1} mod phi(n)
and
(2) m^e=c^{P} mod n 
and 
finally m=(m^e)^d mod n. This works as the receiver knows phi(n). 
By the way, where can we use this? Is there any application you have in mind for this?

Cipher text : 94489103D862769B7AE21EA42C2D400A584D0F919BBCAE2450AD1BE57EAC64E4A2F75FAB9F8FA25BCBC12AAAE58F43CCB071DC002332FF4C736F4DA96A36C3ED

So my concern is, can we reduce the length of cipher text to some minimum length (despite of key size we use), or is there any other asymmetric algorithm that can help me achieve this.
Any help is appreciated. Thanks.
","RSA encryption is described as
c = m^e mod N,

where c is a cipher text, m is an original message, e is public exponent (typically 65537) and N is public modulus.
Thus, c is always smaller than N, but in most of the cases of the same order as it. Sure you can select N and m to get a small c, but this will obviously lead to make encryption weaker, and you need a special key for every message.
Probably, the same problem will be with other assymetric cryptosystems. Shorter cipher text is easier to recover. But you can use AES, which can produce in counter mode a cipher text of the same size as an original message. Which reveals size of the message to the attacker.

","As GregS said, RSACryptoServiceProvider class (not X509Certificate2) provides an ability to perform cryptographic operations. RSACryptoServiceProvider knows nothing about certificate, it knows only keys and their parameters. This is why you don't see any errors.
This means that certificate validation -- is your app responsibility. You should check certificate when encrypting data and skip all certificate checks to decrypt data.

}

Now the strange thing is that with the same private key (loaded from a p12 file) I get two different results for iOS and MacOSX when signing the same data. I am completely puzzled by this. You may notice the method above uses a different implementation for MacOSX using security transforms, but even if I use the iOS implementation on MacOSX (which gives a compile warning but works fine) I get the same result.
The method used for loading the private key from file is below:
+ (SecKeyRef)newPrivateKeyRefWithPassword:(NSString *)password fromData:(NSData *)data {
    NSMutableDictionary * options = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];

    SecKeyRef privateKeyRef = NULL;

    // Set the public key query dictionary
    //change to your .pfx  password here
    [options setObject:password forKey:(id)kSecImportExportPassphrase];

    CFArrayRef items = CFArrayCreate(NULL, 0, 0, NULL);

    OSStatus securityError = SecPKCS12Import((CFDataRef)data,
                                             (CFDictionaryRef)options, &items);

    if (securityError == noErr && CFArrayGetCount(items) > 0) {
        CFDictionaryRef identityDict = CFArrayGetValueAtIndex(items, 0);
        SecIdentityRef identityApp =
        (SecIdentityRef)CFDictionaryGetValue(identityDict,
                                             kSecImportItemIdentity);

        securityError = SecIdentityCopyPrivateKey(identityApp, &privateKeyRef);
        if (securityError != noErr) {
            privateKeyRef = NULL;
        }
    }
    [options release];
    if (items) CFRelease(items);
    return privateKeyRef;
}

And this is the test case I use. Notice that two different strings are printed on iOS and MacOSX:
    NSString *test = @""bla"";
    NSData *testData = [test dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

    NSString *p12Path= [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""private_key"" ofType:@""p12""];

    NSData *p12Data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:p12Path];

    SecKeyRef keyRef = [BMSecurityHelper newPrivateKeyRefWithPassword:@""xxxxxxxx"" fromData:p12Data];

    NSData *signatureData = [testData signatureWithKey:keyRef];
    NSString *signatureString = [BMEncodingHelper base64EncodedStringForData:signatureData withLineLength:0];

    if (keyRef) CFRelease(keyRef);

    NSLog(@""signatureString: %@"", signatureString);

","It's always nice if you can answer your own question. I missed the following: under MacOSX the security transform also calculates the SHA-1 hash automatically, in contrast with the iOS implementation.
I fixed the problem by adding the following in the MacOSX implementation:
SecTransformSetAttribute(signer, kSecInputIsAttributeName, kSecInputIsDigest, &error)

"49308450","Why can't I generate an asymmetric key in SQL Server for a dll?","I have a database project in VS, and am trying to generate an asymmetric key in SQL Server from the dll.  In SSMS, I am trying to run the following:
CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY MyNewKey 
FROM EXECUTABLE FILE = N'C:\{path to dll}\MyDBProj.dll'

The error I get is ""The certificate, asymmetric key, or private key file is not valid or does not exist; or you do not have permissions for it.""
The dll in question was built with SQLCLR permission level = SAFE
My assumption is that it is related to file permissions, but I don't know what security permissions I need to allow on the file to make this happen.  I was informed that I should give the NETWORK SERVICE account read access, which I did.
This is on a local db with mixed mode authentication.  I've tried as both Windows user and under the sa account.
","Given that you are using SQL Server Express LocalDB (which runs as your Login and hence has no permissions issues), the only thing that should cause such an error is if you did not actually sign the Assembly. That can be done in Visual Studio via the ""Signing..."" button in the SQLCLR tab of Project properties.
Signing an Assembly (whether by giving it a strong name or adding a Certificate) places the public key of whatever was used to sign it inside the Assembly. The CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY statement will extract a public key from an Assembly that was placed there by strong naming it. This is not the same as getting the public key of a Certificate that was used to sign the Assembly as they are stored separately.
Of course, if by ""a local db"" you meant that it is merely running on your dev workstation and is not specifically  SQL Server Express LocalDB, then I guess it would be SQL Server Express? If you logged into SQL Server as yourself (you said you tried as a Windows user) and you are a sysadmin, then there still shouldn't be any file system permissions issues, nor any issue with creating an Asymmetric Key.

General
For more information on working with SQLCLR in general, please see the series that I am writing on this topic on SQL Server Central: Stairway to SQLCLR.
Regarding SQL Server 2017
SQL Server 2017 introduced a new security feature (""CLR strict security"", an advanced option) that is enabled by default and requires that ALL Assemblies, even those marked as SAFE, be signed with either an Asymmetric Key (i.e. strong name) or Certificate and have a Login (based on whatever was used to sign the Assembly) that has the UNSAFE ASSEMBLY permission. For details on how to make this work, with or without Visual Studio / SSDT, please see the following two posts of mine:

SQLCLR vs. SQL Server 2017, Part 2: “CLR strict security” – Solution 1
SQLCLR vs. SQL Server 2017, Part 3: “CLR strict security” – Solution 2

Please avoid the new Trusted Assemblies ""feature"" as it has many more flaws than benefits, not to mention it being entirely unnecessary in the first place given that existing functionality already handled the situation ""Trusted Assemblies"" was meant to address. For full details on that and a demo of the proper way to handle existing, unsigned Assemblies, please see: SQLCLR vs. SQL Server 2017, Part 4: “Trusted Assemblies” – The Disappointment.

","
It is a bug to use String as a container for arbitrary random bytes, e.g. userName = new String(encryptorDecryptor.Encrypt(userName.getBytes()));
 is wrong.
I'm not familiar with Blackberry's Java API but in usually you cannot encrypt more than one block with RSA
the toString() methods on arrays (e.g. publicKeySpec.getModulus().toString()) don't return anything useful. You should be able to figure this out just by looking at the data. This is really a beginner java mistake more than a cryptography issue.
Don't using the default character set for the String constructor and String.getBytes() methods. Always specify a character set, usually ""UTF-8"" is perfect.

That's all I had the patience for.

"45059848","How to encrypt/decrypt XMl wiith X.509 certificate correctly?","I want to encrypt a XML file by using a X.509 certificate and also decrypt it, too. As far as I know I need to use the public key (inside the certificate) to encrypt the XML and the private key to decrypt the XML. Thus only the guy with private key is able to read the decrypted data.
Microsoft provides some code for encryption/decryption here:
Encryption: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229744(v=vs.110).aspx
Decryption: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229943(v=vs.110).aspx
As you can see from the first example a X.509 certificate will be loaded to encrypt the file. But the second example does not(!) load a certificate to decrypt the example. It seems that the encrypted file holds all the necessary data to be decrypted? Does this mean that the file can be decrypted by anybody? I think I have a lag of understanding here - why is it not necessary to use a certificate to decrypt the data?
Regards,
Michael
","On decryption, the certificate is loaded from the computers certificate store.  From your second link:

The code example in this procedure decrypts an XML element using an X.509 certificate from the local certificate store of the current user account.

In that example, the public key used to encrypt the XML is stored in the encrypted data and is used to look up the proper certificate from the store.  
So the answer to your question -- ""why is not necessary to use a certificate to decrypt the data"" -- is: it is necessary.  The certificate was loaded automatically.

"47300062","Creating asymmetric keys in SQL Server 2014 for unsafe assemblies","I have 2 DLLs signed in Visual Studio (VS) 2015. A former employee created an asymmetric key and login and I ran one of the assemblies in UNSAFE mode correctly.
I get the following error with the second one: 

Msg 10327, Level 14, State 1, Line 27
     CREATE ASSEMBLY for assembly 'TableFile' failed because assembly 'TableFile' is not authorized for PERMISSION_SET = UNSAFE.  The assembly is authorized when either of the following is true: the database owner (DBO) has UNSAFE ASSEMBLY permission and the database has the TRUSTWORTHY database property on; or the assembly is signed with a certificate or an asymmetric key that has a corresponding login with UNSAFE ASSEMBLY permission.

I can't ask the former employee so how do I find out how to get this to run?  I tried this too:
USE master; 
GO  

CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY AProjectKey FROM EXECUTABLE FILE = 'E:\sqldlls\TableFile.dll' 
CREATE LOGIN AProjectLogin FROM ASYMMETRIC KEY AProjectKey ;  
GRANT UNSAFE ASSEMBLY TO AProjectLogin ;
GO

This gives the following errors:

Msg 15396, Level 16, State 1, Line 9
   An asymmetric key with name 'AProjectKey' already exists or this asymmetric key already has been added to the database.
Msg 15151, Level 16, State 1, Line 10
  Cannot find the asymmetric key 'AProjectKey', because it does not exist or you do not have permission.  
Msg 15151, Level 16, State 1, Line 11
  Cannot find the login 'AProjectLogin', because it does not exist or you do not have permission.

How do I get both these assemblies running in unsafe mode? Thanks in advance.
","Regarding those 3 error messages:

The first could be due to the Asymmetric Key already existing, but under a different name. Keys and Certificates need to be unique in terms of their public key, not just the name (though that obviously needs to be unique as well). Each Key and Certificate has a hash of the public key which is referred to as the ""thumbprint"". The thumbprints of existing Keys / Certificates are checked when creating a new one and will prevent the creation, even of a differently named Key / Certificate, if the thumbprint already exists. That is what the error message means by ""or this asymmetric key already has been added to the database"".
OR:
It could mean that a different Asymmetric Key (i.e. different ""thumbprint"") exists in master, but with the name AProjectKey
Because you couldn't create the same key under a different name, no Asymmetric Key exists with that new name, hence you can't create a Login from it (since, again, the CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY statement failed).
Because you couldn't create the Login, it doesn't exist to be granted any permissions.

Error # 2 helps narrow down the issue. If Error # 1 was caused by an existing Asymmetric Key having the same name but different ""thumbprint"", then you either would have been able to create the Login (if it did not already exist), or you would have gotten an error stating that the Login (i.e. ""server principal"") already exists. But the error is that an Asymmetric Key by that name cannot be found. This should mean that the Asymmetric Key itself does already exist, but under a different name. You can see what Asymmetric Keys have been created by executing the following:
SELECT * FROM sys.asymmetric_keys;

But that doesn't tell you which one came from that Assembly (or an Assembly signed with the same Strong Name Key used to sign this one). For that you need to know the ""thumbprint"", and for that you need to open a Command Prompt (preferably a ""Developer Command Prompt"" which Visual Studio sets up when installed, as it has the correct path set up upon opening it). Then, run the following:
CD /D E:\sqldlls\
sn -T TableFile.dll

You should see:
Public key token is XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Copy and paste that XXXXX ""token"" (i.e. thumbprint) into the following query:
SELECT ak.[name], ak.[sid]
FROM   sys.asymmetric_keys ak
WHERE  ak.[thumbprint] = 0x{XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX}; -- remove the { and }

Assuming that you get a row returned, we need to see if the Login exists. Simply trying to create a Login from the Asymmetric Key won't get us the Login's name if it does exist since you can only have 1 Login created per Key / Certificate, and the error message only reports back the name you are trying to create as the one that already exists, even though it can be a different name for the same Key. So, take the SID from the returned row and paste it in the following query:
SELECT sp.*
FROM   sys.server_principals sp
WHERE  sp.[sid] = 0x{SID_from_sys_asymmetric_keys}; -- remove the { and }

If no row is returned then you should create a Login from that Asymmetric Key.
At this point a Login should exist, so grant it the UNSAFE ASSEMBLY permission.
Now try creating the Assembly again.

"35785400","SQL TD EKM Azure Key Vault - can't restore encrypted database","Using the steps detailed in this MS article I have successfully enabled SQL TDE using Azure as an EKM. To ensure that I would be able to decrypt the data on another server in the event of a DR scenario, I first uploaded my own asymmetric key (in the form of a password-protected pfx file) into Key Vault as per the steps in this MS article.
I'm now trying to test DR, where I'll have to restore a backup of the encrypted DB onto another SQL server, and whatever I try I can't get it to work. I'm sure it's something painfully obvious to those familiar with SQL encryption, but it's got me stumped! 
I've read various articles such as this one explaining how to convert then import the pfx certificate using PVKConverter.exe.  Initially, trying to import the converted pfx threw the error Msg 15581, Level 16, State 1, Line 1. Please create a master key in the database or open the master key in the session before performing this operation. so I created one in the master DB using 
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'MySecurePassword'

This didn't get me any further as the backup still wouldn't restore.
Comparing the two servers, the obvious difference is that the master DB holds my Key Vault-linked Asymmetric key in the encrypted Server A (SELECT * FROM sys.asymmetric_keys) and a certificate in Server B (SELECT * FROM sys.certificates).  I understand that I can't export an asymmetric key from SQL (hence I used the existing pfx in Key Vault) but I just can't work out how to use/import that pfx in Server B to allow me to restore the encrypted DB backup from Server A.  Whenever I attempt to create an asymmetric key in the master DB from my pfx file using the below:
CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY MY_ASYMMETRIC_KEY
FROM FILE = 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL12.CORIC\MSSQL\DATA\\MyPFXFile.pfx'
ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD 'C0mplexP@ssw0rd'

I get the error: Msg 15208, Level 16, State 43, Line 18
The certificate, asymmetric key, or private key file is not valid or does not exist; or you do not have permissions for it.

","I don't know if there is an algorithm that will make a difference in terms of the time it takes to encrypt/decrypt a file of that size.
But you can always try an approach of splitting the file and encrypt/decrypt each part separately where you can use some asynktasks to do it in ""parallel"".
For example you can have 7 files of 10MB each. You decrypt the 7 parts in paralel and stick them together after the decryption.
If you still want to have one physical file, you can put the encrypted separate parts in a zip file and extract them when you need to decrypt.

OSStatus status = noErr;
NSMutableDictionary *privateKeyAttr = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
NSMutableDictionary *publicKeyAttr= [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
NSMutableDictionary *keyPairAttr = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];

NSData * publicTag = [NSData dataWithBytes:publicKeyIdentifier

NSData * privateTag = [NSData dataWithBytes:privateKeyIdentifier
                                     length:strlen((const char *)privateKeyIdentifier)];

SecKeyRef publicKey = NULL;
SecKeyRef privateKey = NULL;

[keyPairAttr setObject:(__bridge id)kSecAttrKeyTypeRSA
                forKey:(__bridge id)kSecAttrKeyType];
[keyPairAttr setObject:[NSNumber numberWithInt:2048]

[privateKeyAttr setObject:[NSNumber numberWithBool:YES]

status = SecKeyGeneratePair((__bridge CFDictionaryRef)keyPairAttr,
                            &_publicKey, &_privateKey);

I then use the following code to obtain the raw data for the public key:
NSData* publicTag = [[NSData alloc] initWithBytes:publicKeyIdentifier length:sizeof(publicKeyIdentifier)];

OSStatus sanityCheck = noErr;
NSData* publicKeyBits = nil;

NSMutableDictionary* queryPublicKey = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
[queryPublicKey setObject:(__bridge id)kSecClassKey forKey:(__bridge id)kSecClass];
[queryPublicKey setObject:publicTag forKey:(__bridge id)kSecAttrApplicationTag];
[queryPublicKey setObject:(__bridge id)kSecAttrKeyTypeRSA forKey:(__bridge id)kSecAttrKeyType];

// Temporarily add key to the Keychain, return as data:
NSMutableDictionary* attributes = [queryPublicKey mutableCopy];
[attributes setObject:(__bridge id)key forKey:(__bridge id)kSecValueRef];
[attributes setObject:@YES forKey:(__bridge id)kSecReturnData];
CFTypeRef result;
sanityCheck = SecItemAdd((__bridge CFDictionaryRef)attributes, &result);
if (sanityCheck == errSecSuccess) {
    publicKeyBits = CFBridgingRelease(result);

    // Remove from Keychain again:
    (void)SecItemDelete((__bridge CFDictionaryRef)queryPublicKey);
}
return publicKeyBits;

The above code yields NSData of 270 bytes long for the public key; I base64 encode this data and send it to the device, but it is rejected.
My colleague at work has completed implementation of the same functionality for android, and he generates his key pair as follows:
    KeyPairGenerator kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"");
    kpg.initialize(2048);
    KeyPair key = kpg.generateKeyPair();

And he uses:
    key.getPublic().getEncoded() 

To access the public key data, which is 294 bytes long, and which the device accepts.
Also, if I take the raw bytes of his generated public key, and use my base64 encode and send, this is also accepted by the device.
What is the difference here? Why is his key 294 bytes, while mine is 270? And how can I fix this? Any help would be much appreciated.
EDIT

","1) I'm not sure using RSA will fix that, unless all your mobile apps have the same public/private key combos. A browser could just as easily use RSA and encrypt the data.
A way to do this might be to check the HTTP headers coming in for headers inserted by the mobile operator and if those headers can be faked.
It's a hard problem. I'll keep thinking about it and let you know if something comes to mind.
2) For session-based encryption, you can use the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange algorithm to negotiate a session key and then use that to lock requests to a session.
3) sounds good.
4) I think the only way around a phone being hacked is to require users to login, because you need to authenticate the user, not only the device. The other thing is that people share phones, so it may not even have been hacked. It may just have been leant out.

You generally can't. You need to have your mobile apps authenticate to the server in some way (private account, Google account, SSL client certificate, etc.)
Use regular, cookie-based sessions. Use a solution that provides truly random session IDs and secure with SSL to guard against session hijacking, etc.
Use SSL (HTTPS)
Not sure what that means. If you are doing device-specific authentication, you need a way to revoke accounts, so that a stolen, etc. phone cannot be used. 

Last but not least: Do Not Try to Invent a Secure Protocol. Use HTTPS and don't think you can create a secure solution, just because you read a book/blog/article/textbook about it. 
Again: Please Use HTTPS.

To keep their password safe I will use an openssl public key to encode it in my db and a private key to decode it before my scrapper log in to their account page.  
I'm wondering where to put my private key so the passwords are safe even if someone take controller of my web server?  Because It would be totally inappropriate to just leave the private key on the web server...
tks
","If someone takes total control of your server and is interested in those passwords, he will succeed. Always take this into consideration and make plans on what to do in this case.
Now to make it as hard as possible and improbable to achieve this, I suggest to store the key (or better, the passwords) in some kind of memory table: like a Ramdisk, a script that will give out only one password per minute and delete itself if called more than that etc.
I don't see any positive effect of using public key encryption here, the key to decrypt must be stored on the server no matter what you use. You may look for Howtos that descripe the problem of https-certificates, they should be protected by passphrases and must be read on server start - the problem is related.
Probably a good solution would be to log into the server, store the passwordfile in a ramdisk and log out. Repeat on Server reboot, crash or password change.

How do you, when you receive a message on C2 that supposedly comes from C1 (by checking the GUID and seeing that it matches the GUID of C1), but since the message is not guaranteed to have come from C1 (C3 might just have sent the message, sending the GUID of C1 in the message header) there has to be some verification that the message actually came from C1.
I've been looking into using asymmetric encryption (RSA) to have C1 send a message that consists of [C1.GUID; RSAEncrypt(C2.PUBLIC_KEY, C1.GUID); MESSAGE], and then let C2 basically do a check like this (python pseudo code):
message.GUID == RSADecrypt(C2.PRIVATE_KEY, message.ENCRYPTED_GUID)

Is this a viable approach? Or is there some other clever/more obvious way to verify the sender of a message?
","The problem with this method is that any machine could then capture the guid and rsa-encrypted-guid and pass them just the same. You haven't really created any unique challenge/response criteria that can only be divined by the receiving client. What you would need would be something that is completely unique and can't be gotten simply by looking at passed parameters. Maybe something like:
[ClientName; RSA-ENCRYPTED(GUID+Timestamp); MESSAGE]

In this method, the RSA encryption would be done using Client2's public key so that only Client2's private key could unlock it. Using the ClientName, Client2 could retrieve the expected GUID from a datasource, and then match the returned GUID against the one in the encryption. I incorporated the usage of a timestamp as a salt so that the encrypted string comes out differently each time. It's considered very weak to use a timestamp as a randomization for a salt, but it gets the point across. Other more secure/random algorithms could be implemented.

","Assymmetric Algorithms have been invented for such purposes, that's the way digital signatures work.
However, your approach has some problems. Anyone with the public key of the recipient could fake the signature. Also, the signature does not change at all! Anyone intercepting the messages can fake being a valid sender. The purpose of assymetric encryption is to defeat these problems with key exchanges, there's the concept of the digital signature, which is basically an assymetrically encrypted hash of the message you are tossing around.
For RSA, you need to do a bit more in order to create a digital signature from the basic algorithm, see wikipedia for more details: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA#Signing_messages

","Public and private keys are the way to go. I will assume you don't care about encrypting the data, but you do care that the data is ""authorized"".
Lets say you have 3 computers 
Comp1
Comp2
Comp3
Lets also say you want Comp1 to send a message to Comp3. you don't care if the message was intercepted, but you do care that it was not forged.
Comp1 will digitally sign the message with its private key
Comp2 will intercept the message from Comp1 to Comp3, but can't change the message without invalidating the signature
Comp2 will forward the message onto Comp3
Comp3 will use Comp1's public key to decrypt the signature and use the hash in the signature to validate the contents.
Now if you want to encrypt the data, you need to add an extra step
Comp1 will digitally sign the message with its private key
Comp1 will generate an random encryption key(typically AES) and encrypt the message.
Comp1 will take that encryption key and encrypt it with Comp3's public key
Comp2 will intercept the message, but cannot read it without Comp3's private key
Comp2 will forward the message onto Comp3
Comp3 will use it's private key to decrypt the AES key
Comp3 will decrypt the entire message using the AES key
Comp3 will validate the message by decrypting the signature with Comp1's public key.
Signature contains a hash of the message, if the hash and the message's hash match, then the data is intact.
You can include the GUIDs in the payload to use as a lookup to decide which public keys to use.
P.S. You will want to use the built in methods to sign a message. Let the Framework do the hashing/etc

const crypto = require('crypto')

const { privateKey, publicKey } = crypto.generateKeyPairSync('ec', {
  namedCurve: 'sect239k1',
  publicKeyEncoding: { type: 'spki', format: 'der' },
  privateKeyEncoding: { type: 'pkcs8', format: 'der' },
})

const sign = crypto.createSign('SHA256')
sign.write('some data to sign')
sign.end()
const signature = sign.sign(privateKey, 'hex')

const verify = crypto.createVerify('SHA256')
verify.write('some data to sign')
verify.end()
console.log(verify.verify(publicKey, signature))
// Prints: true or false

But it now throws me a new error

","You say you're using Node.js version 10 but your link points to the documentation for Node.js version 11.  The documentation for version 10 is at https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/crypto.html
In version 11, the publicKeyEncoding and privateKeyEncoding properties of the options object passed as the second argument to crypto.generateKeyPairSync are optional.  In version 10 these properties are not optional, they must be specified.  Your program doesn't provide those properties, and that's why it's blowing up.
If you change:
const { privateKey, publicKey } = crypto.generateKeyPairSync('ec', {
  namedCurve: 'sect239k1'
});

to:
const { privateKey, publicKey } = crypto.generateKeyPairSync('ec', {
  namedCurve: 'sect239k1',
  publicKeyEncoding:  { type: 'spki', format: 'der' },
  privateKeyEncoding: { type: 'pkcs8', format: 'der' }
});

then your program should be much happier.

Update
OK, I installed Node 10 and ran your program.  sign.sign() is blowing up because, as stated in the documentation, it requires the private key to be in PEM format.  It can't handle a private key in the DER format my original answer produced.  The same applies to the format of the public key passed to verify.verify() -- it must be PEM, not DER.  So change this:
const { privateKey, publicKey } = crypto.generateKeyPairSync('ec', {
  namedCurve: 'sect239k1',
  publicKeyEncoding:  { type: 'spki', format: 'der' },
  privateKeyEncoding: { type: 'pkcs8', format: 'der' }
});

to this:
const { privateKey, publicKey } = crypto.generateKeyPairSync('ec', {
  namedCurve: 'sect239k1',
  publicKeyEncoding:  { type: 'spki', format: 'pem' },
  privateKeyEncoding: { type: 'pkcs8', format: 'pem' }
});

That is, change both occurrences of 'der' to 'pem'.
That will let your program run without throwing exceptions.  However, the verification attempt will fail and the reported result written by the final console.log() call will be false.  That's because the program does not tell verify.verify() the encoding that was used in the privateKey string.  To fix that and get a true result from the verification, change:
verify.verify(publicKey, signature)

to:
verify.verify(publicKey, signature, 'hex')

matching the string encoding that was specified when the signature was generated by sign.sign().  The documentation isn't very clear on this part, but from experimentation it seems that if the signature is a string then you must always specify the encoding of the string.  The only circumstance in which you can skip providing the encoding here is if you also skip it in the sign.sign() call, which would have caused signature to be generated as a Buffer rather than as a string.

"34967313","Using asymmetric encryption for license file","I want to send to a client an encrypted file that contains the license data for my application. As I will use asymmetric encryption, I will encrypt the file using a private key and send it to the client. The application on the client's pc will decrypt the sent file using a public key located in the application code.  
The threat model I aspect here is that the public key could be extracted from the application .dll files (using .net reflector for example) and used to regenerate the license.
So is there a way to protect my application ?
Update:
I went through the code example in the following link for encryption the xml file.
The problem I am facing now is that both keys will be generated in the client pc same as mine according to the code sample. So is this right or there is a misunderstanding from me?
Also as Alexe Barlescu suggested to use the ProtectedData class to protect the private key, how can I achieve that ?
","Asymmetric Encryption uses two keys: 

a public key for encrypting the data
a private key for the decryption of the data

Encrypt the file containing the license with client's Public Key, so only he can decrypt it, with his Private Key.
To make your client's Private key safe, encrypt it with Protect method located in ProtectedData class in System.Security.Cryptography namespace. The Private key will be stored on his computer encrypted, he can decrypt the key only when he needs to decrypt a message sent from you.

","If you want to make sure that the private key-holder cannot encrypt something such that the result is indistinguishable from a message sent by the public key-holder, then you could simply double-wrap your data.
Simply have two key-pairs.
Side A gets the private key of key-pair 1, and the public key of key-pair 2.
Side B gets the public key of key-pair 1, and the private key of key-pair 2.
Side B sends his/her/its message by first encrypting it with the public key of key-pair 1, and then the private key of key-pair 2.
Side A decrypts the result using the public key of key-pair 2, and the private key of key-pair 1 (in that order).
Side A can generate the public key of key-pair 1, but cannot generate the private key of key-pair 2, so side A cannot generate a valid message.
The inverse works in the other direction.
Down-side:  If you have a central person (or server) that every other person (or computer) is communicating with, each party needs their own private key, and they need to share the corresponding public key with the central person (or server) they are communicating with.

"46958289","Nested JWS + JWE vs JWE with Authenticated Encryption","Problem
I want to sign and encrypt (effectively, obfuscate) some information ('token') on my server (a trusted environment) and send the cyphertext to a client machine (not quite trusted environment) to be read and verified by my client-side software. This type of the environment allows me to have a private key on the server for asymmetric signing, but I cannot 'hide' a secret key for symmetric signing on a client side. 
Alternatives
I chose to use JWT as a standard and Nimbus JOSE+JWT library as an implementation for signing and encryption. Nimbus library provides two options for sign + encrypt: nest JWS into JWE or use JWE with authenticated encryption algorithm (A128CBC_HS256, A192CBC_HS384, or A256CBC_HS512). Algorithm Selection Guide for Nimbus states:

Encryption in JOSE is always authenticated, meaning that ciphertext’s integrity is protected from tampering. Authenticated encryption thus makes nesting an HMAC JWT inside a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) redundant; use just JWE encryption.

However, AxxxCBC_HSxxx encryption methods use only symmetric keys. Additionally, replacing direct JWE algorithm with RSA JWE algorithm should not help, because an abuser can generate CEK (consisting of encryption key and key for HMAC) themselves and encrypt it with a public key.
Question
Despite the quote about the redundancy of nested JWTs, I concluded, that  for my case JWE+JWS nesting is the only workable approach. Am I right?
","Clarifications
Every content encryption algorithms (AxxxGCM and AxxxCBC_HSxxx) use a symmetric key (CEK). This key is determined by the key encryption algorithm and its key management mode (random CEK, key agreement, direct key...).
You are right, contrary to the AxxxGCM algorithms, the AxxxCBC algorithms are not authenticated encryption algorithms.
However, the RFC7516 section 5.1 item 15. (specification for JWE) introduces a tag that allows to authenticate the cyphertext and protect the integrity of the protected header (that is why the AxxxCBC algorithm is used with the HSxxx).
This is confirmed by the table in the RFC7518 section 5.1. Details are given in the next section.
In any case, you will need 2 algorithms for JWE computation:

The key encryption algorithm: you mentioned you have an asymmetric key so I guess you will chose an RSA or an ECDH-ES algorithm depending on your key type.
The content encryption key: AxxxGCM or AxxxCBC_HSxxx algorithms. With the JWE specification both offer an authenticated encryption. Personally I prefer AxxxGCM algorithms because they are faster in my environment.

Answer
You indicated that you want sign and encrypt but you cannot hide a secret key on client side thus the signature will not be guaranteed.
If you only encrypt (JWE only), your server will not be able to verify the issuer of the token.

Usually the architecture for these kinds of things is as follows:

Database
Server
Client

The Client connects to the Server, which then connects to the Database.
The Server makes sure the Client authenticates correctly before allowing them access to sensitive information.  The decryption key is stored only on the server.  Noone should have access to the server, and especially the file that contains the key.  This way the clients do not have any encryption/decryption they have to do, and do not have to store any keys.

","Sounds like you want x.509 authentication. Help on getting that setup is a little too broad for a single stack overflow question. There are various guides you can find with a Google search and for the nitty gritty details of what is happening under the hood and common issues I wrote a long blog post.
If you really don't want the encryption of the ""whole connection"" (and I would strongly encourage you to reconsider that since it is basically free) you can use on the NULL cipher suites with the SSL connection. Configuring the client to offer only NULL cipher suites (and getting the server to accept them) will, again, require more details on your specific setup.

","Just a couple suggestions:
-You should consider symmetric keys embedded into anything outside your server as public due to reverse engineering (i.e. don't bother even encrypting if the key is out in the wild).
-You should use a per-session symmetric key generated by a secure RNG on the client, and transmitted to the server encrypted with the global asymmetric public key.  Private keys have a shelf-life.
-You can use the session key for all files/streams transferred in that session, but you should use a unique nonce to salt the symmetric-key encryption for each file.  Depending on the encryption mode, using the same key/nonce with more than one stream can leave you vulnerable to XOR'ing the two streams and recovering a mashed-together but unencrypted result.

","I cannot reproduce the problem myself - I don't have the ""pendrive token"" which I suspect is the problem - so this is guesswork.
There are two generations of cryptographic APIs in Windows - the ""old"" one and the ""new generation"" one, known as CNG.
Now, if you look at the source code for the CngLightup type that appears midway through your stack trace, specifically the DetectRsaCngSupport method, you'll see that .NET framework tries to use the new generation API if possible. My guess is that the ""pendrive token"" device does not support the new API. You can verify this by forcing the use of the old API. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a public configuration flag that controls this, so you must resort to reflection-based hacks. For example, you can put something like this at the beginning of your program, so that it runs once, before you try the decrypting operation:
    var cngLightupType = typeof(EncryptedXml).Assembly.GetType(""System.Security.Cryptography.CngLightup"");
    var preferRsaCngField = cngLightupType.GetField(""s_preferRsaCng"", BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.NonPublic);
    var getRsaPublicKeyField = cngLightupType.GetField(""s_getRsaPublicKey"", BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.NonPublic);
    var getRsaPrivateKeyField = cngLightupType.GetField(""s_getRsaPrivateKey"", BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.NonPublic);
    preferRsaCngField.SetValue(null, new Lazy<bool>(() => false));
    getRsaPublicKeyField.SetValue(null, null);
    getRsaPrivateKeyField.SetValue(null, null);

Do note that it is extremely hacky, not thread-safe, error handling is omitted etc. If you verify that the CNG usage is the problem, you can then ask the ""pendrive token"" supplier to provide drivers that work with CNG. Or you can live with the hack above, rewritten for more safety.

","When you say ""with a private key"" I assume you mean you're using SecKeyDecrypt() for asymmetric encryption rather than CommonCryptor for symmetric encryption.
SecKeyDecrypt() does not support OAEP. It only supports PKCS1 v1.5 padding (kSecPaddingPKCS1). It can also technically handle ASN.1 padding + PKCS1 padding, but this isn't usually relevant to decryption. You should have noticed this when you passed the SecPadding parameter. What did you pass?

I have encrypted a picture some time ago and I did it by reading the picture into a 2048 huge byt array. After that I split it every 2048 bytes into a single byte file (it was a small picture) and after that I had like 20 files with different names and that was pretty simple but also a good encryption
2nd Method is by using the Caesar Encryption (something like that) which mean that you move every byte 2 places up or down (or more than 2)

","Here's what you need to decide: do I want an encrypted file or do I want an encrypted PDF? The distinction is important. If you want an encrypted file, that's on you. Possible reasons why you're having problems might include that PDF is frequently part binary, and although that shouldn't make a difference to bouncy castle, it may inform the type of reader you're using for data, for example.
If you're trying to get an encrypted PDF (and I suspect this is what you really want) bouncy castle won't (directly) do that for you. 
Instead you need to use iText, a tool based on iText, or another similar library (JoltPdf, for example) which can consume PDF and correctly write encrypted PDF out. Encrypted PDF is a PDF file that is only partially encrypted. The PDF elements of type string and stream will be encrypted using a supplied password, a specified encryption algorithm, and some salt. In addition, depending on the encryption algorithm, the document may get signed, which is its own thing that doesn't follow most typical signing processes.
Under the hood, iText and JoltPdf use bouncy castle to do the hashing, encryption, and signing.

public_key is used as the public point, and the scalar specified must be

","This is really difficult to answer, as it depends on how far you need to protect this data.
First step is obviously encrypting all details stored in mysql, incase someone gets a dump of your database.
This solution is good, but it introduces the vulnerability as if someone gets the decryption keys from your application server, they would be able to decrypt the dump of the database anyway.
There are many solutions to consider from here, i'm sure with some research you should be able to find some decent ones, but one way that comes to mind is:
You could encrypt the data on the application servers with a public/private key encryption algorithm. Public key can only be used to encrypt the information for storage, which lives on your application server. If that gets hacked, the only thing that they will be able to do is to add more data to your database =/. The private key in this case will be a password that would need to be entered every time a human needs to see this information.
This has the obvious disadvantage that you can't do any machine processing on your data, as its traveling completely encrypted all the way until its displayed.
(And you still have vulnerabilities of someone gaining access to your application server and simply dumping the session files/memcache where the key would have to be stored temporarily)
To be honest, first thing i'd do is encrypt the entire database one way or another. That alone adds a decent layer of protection. Dumping the database is easier than getting access to the file system of a server in most cases.

Should I do the parsing of the key manually?

","Simple. Add a BufferedInputStream between the FileInputStream and the CipherInputStream whewn decrypting, or a BufferedOutputStream between the CipherOutputStream and the FileOutputStream when encrypting, as appropriate. This will regularize the I/O to/from the file to 8192 bytes at a time, instead of whatever the cipher streams may do.
The buffer size of the buffered streams doesn't even matter much: it is 8192 by default and there is no harm in increasing that. 
You could also increase the size of your own buffer.

","So I did some more tests... it turns out that: PrivateKey, regardless was it generated by KeyPairGenerator, imported from a file, or imported from KeyStore, cannot be used for decrypting once you are using AndroidKeyStore as a provider, even if you have KeyProperties.PURPOSE_ENCRYPT and KeyProperties.PURPOSE_DECRYPT properties added.
However, SecretKey (which is a symmetric algorithm) has no problem to be used for encrypting/decrypting when stored/generated in AndroidKeyStore.
So looks like AndroidKeyStore did not allow encrypting/decrypting in asymmetric algorithm after all, which was not clearly explained in the Android keystore system guide.
If anyone want to use asymmetric algorithm encryption/decryption with AndroidKeyStore, here's the code I used for testing. It encrypts the string ""123456789"" and then decrypts it, then shows the decrypted string in a toast, which should be ""123456789""
Worked fine for me
String alias = ""2"";

","It looks like your issue was introduced with Android Oreo, but has a workaround.
This stackoverflow post discusses it:
Android 8.0: IllegalBlocksizeException when using RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-512AndMGF1Padding
This Google issue tracker has good discussion on it:
https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36708951
You need to add this line:
OAEPParameterSpec sp = new OAEPParameterSpec(""SHA-256"", ""MGF1"", new MGF1ParameterSpec(""SHA-1""), PSource.PSpecified.DEFAULT);

And modify these lines, adding the sp parameter:
encrypt.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE,pubKey,sp);
decrypt.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE,privkey,sp);

At first, I thought it was some restriction of AndroidKeyStore that prevents me from using the private key, so I tried using directly the one generated by KeyPairGenerator but nothing changed
What could cause this problem?
I've been searching online for days and I found nothing wrong with the code above (apart from not being the final product)
My device is Android 8.1.0

Edit: Thanks Steve Miskovetz a lot for the solution, and I just found the Android official guide for this topic:
  Cryptography
(don't know why I wasn't able to find this earlier)

","asymmetric key encryption available from android 6+( api 23+). This is a good guide for android's encryption. Additionsly after getBytes called you need to encode bytes with Base64.

I've started down the following path:
public static void DeriveKeyPair(string pass, byte[] salt)
{
    using (var derived = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(pass, salt, 10000))
    {
        var randomNum = new Random(BitConverter.ToInt32(derived.GetBytes(4), 0));
        // Can't seem to find an asymmetric implementation that I can supply the seed to
    }
}

Ignoring the fact that the return type isn't going to do anything useful, the big problem I'm having is that I can't seem to find an asymmetric crypto provider that I can either seed, or provide the seeded number generator to.
I'm doing this so I don't have to store the private key anywhere, this is a security consideration and aids in portability as the keys can be derived on any machine provided the same password (and salt - which is initially unique and random).
","After some hunting around I decided to settle upon generating a random RSA key-pair, and then symmetrically encrypting the private key using AES.
This leads me to the two following methods:
public static byte[] EncryptData(string pass, byte[] salt, byte[] encryptedPrivateKey, byte[] targetPublicKey,
    byte[] iv, byte[] data)
{
    using (var rfc = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(pass, salt, IterationCount))
    {
        using (var aes = new AesCryptoServiceProvider())
        {
            aes.KeySize = AesKeySize;
            aes.Key = rfc.GetBytes(aes.KeySize / 8);
            aes.IV = iv;

            using (var dec = aes.CreateDecryptor(aes.Key, aes.IV))
            {
                using (var ms = new MemoryStream(encryptedPrivateKey))
                {
                    using (var cs = new CryptoStream(ms, dec, CryptoStreamMode.Read))
                    {
                        var privKey = new byte[RsaKeySize];
                        cs.Read(privKey, 0, privKey.Length);
                        return RsaEncrypt(targetPublicKey, data);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

public static byte[] DecryptData(string pass, byte[] salt, byte[] encryptedPrivateKey, byte[] iv, byte[] data)
{
    using (var rfc = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(pass, salt, IterationCount))
    {
        using (var aes = new AesCryptoServiceProvider())
        {
            aes.KeySize = AesKeySize;
            aes.Key = rfc.GetBytes(aes.KeySize/8);
            aes.IV = iv;

            using (var dec = aes.CreateDecryptor(aes.Key, aes.IV))
            {
                using (var ms = new MemoryStream(encryptedPrivateKey))
                {
                    using (var cs = new CryptoStream(ms, dec, CryptoStreamMode.Read))
                    {
                        var privKey = new byte[RsaKeySize];
                        cs.Read(privKey, 0, privKey.Length);
                        return RsaDecrypt(privKey, data);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}


RSA isn't enough.
Essentially, RSA can only encrypt data that's smaller than the key size
In my new scheme:

User identity is the RSA public key and an RSA private key that has been encrypted with AES by deriving the AES key using the password and salt
Encrypting data involves:


Generating a random AES key
Encrypting the data with that AES key
Generating an RSA signature of the encrypted data using the RSA private key of the originator
Access to the data is granted by RSA encrypting the random AES key with the target's public RSA key


This allows me to store all the core information:

Public key
Salt
Initialisation Vector
Encrypted private key

pretty much where I want, because the password is needed to actually crack the private key.
Decrypting is relatively simple too:

Receive incoming data
RSA verify it against the purported sender's RSA public key
Decrypt receiver's RSA private key from derived password + salt AES key
Decrypt access key (embedded / hosted AES key)
Decrypt received data using the provided key

It's a conceptual issue. I have a client and a server application and they must connect securely. I have been googling some options to achieve so but I'm not very satisfied to any of them. 

The use of asymmetric keys requires the user to have a public key. This will be an opensource project so hardcoding the key in the source code is not an option. Also, I understood that using a certificate to trade the public key between both parts would avoid a man in the middle, but it makes me a little bit dizzy. I didn't understand very much how it can be accomplished and I don't know where I can get (for free) a valid certificate.
The use of symmetric keys requires both client and server to have the same key. So anyone who downloads the application would be able to access the cryptographer key and use it.

I've read somewhere I could generate a random number that varies from time to time and use it to encrypt data. However, since it is an opensouce application, anyone who is able to read how this number varies over time would also be able to decrypt data, right?
What am I missing here? I appreciate you help. Btw, I'm using Java and it's not a web application.

What algorithm I should use to achieve this?
In my understanding if I use RSA, I can decrypt in c# using private key whereas the encryption has to happen from other hand so this doesn't fit-in my scenario. Is there any other asymmetric algorithm or ways to achieve this?

Server encrypt - private key. 
Client decrypt - public key.

","
Is there any other asymmetric algorithm or ways to achieve this please suggest.

I want to correct your understanding of asymmetric encryption. Asymmetric encryption allows anyone with the public key to send a secret message to anyone with the private key. Since the public key is public, asymmetric encryption allows many possible senders to send private messages to a few special recipients.

My web server would generate and encrypt the token. I want the client to decrypt the token to read certain payload information.

In that case, with the server sending a secret message to the client, if you are using asymmetric encryption, then the server will encrypt with the public key, and the client will decrypt with the private key. 

Server encrypt - private key. Client decrypt - public key.

That is not correct. In asymmetric cryptography, the public key does the encryption and the private key does the decryption.
What you might be thinking about is a digitally signed message. In that case, the sender signs the message with the private key and the receiver verifies the signature with the public key. Digitally signed messages are not secret, though, whereas encrypted messages are secret.

Is there any other asymmetric algorithm or ways to achieve this please suggest.

Since your use case is not entirely clear, I will stop the answer there, and leave it at correcting your understanding of asymmetric encryption. It might be that you need symmetric encryption or a digital signature. I encourage you to ask another, separate StackOverflow question as a follow up to this one. 

As a final note, I'll refer you to the Internet Security Glossary. In particular, the section named ""$ asymmetric cryptography"" has a precise and brief description about how ""Asymmetric cryptography can be used to create algorithms for encryption, digital signature, and key agreement.""

From your other (unfortunately on hold) question Protecting JWT Signing and Encryption C# Solution, it sounds like you require the following: 

Send a payload from the server to the client. 
Only the client can read the payload, because it is encrypted.
The client can verify who sent the payload, because it is signed. 

The recommended approach is to sign-and-then-encrypt. If you are wanting to use asymmetric encryption for both: 

use a private to key to sign the payload,
then use a public key to encrypt the signed payload.

I think its more a problem with the objectstreams, everytime i try to work with objectstreams on a socket i got similar problems.
Does someone had an idea whats there happening ?
","You can't use multiple streams over the same socket in general. There are specific cases where it works but in general you're up against unknown buffering which will get your peers out of sync quick as a wink. Redo it with a single ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStreamat each end. If you only need to encrypt certain parts of the stream, look into SealedObject.

"44079306","How do you use asymmetric keys or certificate authentication in SNMP4J?","I am working on a project that would like to be able to use certificates or keys as a method of authentication for SNMPv3. We are using the java library SNMP4J.
During my research I have found that SNMP uses TLS/DTLS for message encryption and supposedly also for authentication. Source 1 | Source 2 | Source 3
Looking into the little documentation SNMP4J has, I found that it allows the usage of TLS certificates for encrypting traffic. But I am not sure how the authentication is done, if possible, using a public/private key pair. TLS Traffic Encryption Example | SNMP4J Documentation
Any help would be appreciated.
","I was able to authenticate using a similar method as described in the example TLS Traffic Encryption Example.
So as one would expect from the example, I can confirm that SNMP4J uses the keystore set in the Java Property javax.net.ssl.keystore, javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword, javax.net.ssl.trustStore, and javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword.
Below are the changes I made to the example to make it work.
The alias (or security name in the documentation) needs to be set in the CertifiedTarget constructor so it knows which certificate to use.
 CertifiedTarget ct = new CertifiedTarget(new OctetString(alias));

The security level must be set or the SNMP agent will complain and fail authentication.
 ct.setSecurityLevel(SecurityLevel.AUTH_PRIV);

The SecurityCallback subject DN must match the server certificate subject EXACTLY the way it wants otherwise it will deny all responses.
 securityCallback.addAcceptedSubjectDN(""EMAILADDRESS=admin@net-snmp.org, CN=snmpagent, OU=Development, O=Net-SNMP, L=Davis, ST=CA, C=US"");

Lastly, you must register the server public certificate alias (Security Name) with the address.
 securityCallback.addLocalCertMapping(ct.getAddress(), ""snmpagent"");

It comes together to look something like this.
// Set java keystore manually
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.keyStore"", KEYSTORE_DIR);
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword"", ""changeit"");
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStore"", KEYSTORE_DIR);
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword"", ""changeit"");

// create the TLS transport mapping:
TLSTM transport = new TLSTM();

// set the security callback (only required for command responder,
// but also recommended for command generators) -
// the callback will be configured later:
DefaultTlsTmSecurityCallback securityCallback = new DefaultTlsTmSecurityCallback();
((TLSTM) transport).setSecurityCallback(securityCallback);
MessageDispatcher md = new MessageDispatcherImpl();
// we need MPv3 for TLSTM:
MPv3 mpv3 = new MPv3();
md.addMessageProcessingModel(mpv3);

Snmp snmp = new Snmp(md, transport);

// create and initialize the TransportSecurityModel TSM:
SecurityModels.getInstance().addSecurityModel(new TSM(new OctetString(mpv3.getLocalEngineID()), false));

// do not forget to listen for responses:
snmp.listen();

CertifiedTarget ct = new CertifiedTarget(new OctetString(""alias""));
ct.setVersion(SnmpConstants.version3);
ct.setSecurityModel(SecurityModel.SECURITY_MODEL_TSM);
ct.setAddress(GenericAddress.parse(myAddress));
ct.setSecurityLevel(SecurityLevel.AUTH_PRIV);

securityCallback.addAcceptedSubjectDN(""EMAILADDRESS=admin@net-snmp.org, CN=snmpagent, OU=Development, O=Net-SNMP, L=Davis, ST=CA, C=US"");
securityCallback.addLocalCertMapping(ct.getAddress(), ""snmpagentalias"");

PDU pdu = new ScopedPDU();
pdu.add(new VariableBinding(new OID(someOid)));
pdu.setType(PDU.GET);

ResponseEvent response = snmp.send(pdu, ct);

You also have to make sure all the certificates are properly configured so that it actually takes them.
As a side-note, in the discovery of this my team and I discovered several bugs in the TLS handling by SNMP4J, mostly in the transport layer. It seems to be a timing issue (race condition maybe?) where it will get the SNMP data but then ignore it. We were able to get around it by setting the CertifiedTarget timeout and retries really high. We will officially report on this when we have more information.

"15102511","Updating an Assembly with an Asymmetric Key","I have previously created an assembly with VS 2010 and signed it with a key. I ran a script like this below:
USE master; 
GO  

CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY SQLCLRPSBatch20Key FROM EXECUTABLE FILE = 'C:\Unsafe\MyDLL.dll';   
CREATE LOGIN SQLCLRPSBatch20Login FROM ASYMMETRIC KEY SQLCLRPSBatch20Key;  
GRANT UNSAFE ASSEMBLY TO SQLCLRPSBatch20Login;
GO

use MyDB;
GO

// create assembly script here to install unsafe assembly

Now do I need to do this and create a new key and login each time I drop the assembly on the DB and reinstall to update it?
When I do that, I get:
Msg 15396, Level 16, State 1, Line 2
An asymmetric key with name 'SQLCLRPSBatch20Key' already exists or this asymmetric key already has been added to the database.
Msg 15151, Level 16, State 1, Line 3
Cannot find the asymmetric key 'SQLCLRPSBatch20Key', because it does not exist or you do not have permission.
Msg 15151, Level 16, State 1, Line 4
Cannot find the login 'SQLCLRPSBatch20Login', because it does not exist or you do not have permission.

So I guess since the assembly was creating and signed the same way, I just have to install it. Is this correct?
","No. The creating of a login (or, more precisely, a server principal) from the asymmetric key is a way to say ""hey... someone who has the rights to do such a thing probably looked at your CLR code and gave it the thumbs-up"". After the server principal is created, any assemblies signed with the key that backs it will be okay to run.

the problem is, we can't reverse the hashed password to its original form.According to my requirement, I have to reverse the hashed password to its original form since we have to pass the original form of password for authentication to a third party API.
The symmetric algorithm uses the same key for decryption and
encryption.So it is necessary to share the key securely to front end and backend.It is not a good method if we hard code the key value on both sides.
The asymmetric algorithm uses the public and private key for
encryption and decryption respectively.So I think this is much more secure than above two techniques.Since an intruder who has public

","Not sure if this is still relevant to you, but here comes. These are quite high level and broad questions you are asking, so I'm providing you some general guidance.
I would definitely use asymmetric encryption for this. I'd most likely pick something like RSA OAEP which produces different cipher text on the same input each time thanks to the random padding. This way an attacker won't learn that much from the cipher text that he could manage to intercept.
The key exchange is a trickier topic as your end-user software most likely runs in a browser (being an Angular app). One way to handle this could be to wrap your public key in a certificate that can be verified in the browser.
There are also many other attacks and aspects you need to consider. For example how to protect your system against replay attacks and how to rotate your keys while still meeting your availability requirements. Covering all topics in this answer is not possible them to being too broad, so I leave it here.

","The error gives you the information that the padding is wrong. JSencrypt is based on JSBN and only supports PKCS#1 v1.5 padding, but not OAEP. You have to configure NodeRSA to use the appropriate padding:
var key_pri = new NodeRSA(privateKeyString, {
    encryptionScheme: 'pkcs1'
});

Then, you're passing a Base64-encoded string to key_pri.decrypt, but it expects the actual data as a Buffer, so you first need to parse that:
var decrypted = key_pri.decrypt(new Buffer(encrypted, 'base64'), 'utf8');

"2882651","Best Practice for Sensitive User Information Storage on Remote Service","We have a desktop and mobile application that is used to access many third party services. 
These services have some potentially sensitive information - eg Authentication tokens, and in some cases plaintext usernames/passwords. 
We want to provide a service to synchronise their settings across multiple computers and devices. That is - they sign into a service we provide, and then that information is synchronised across wherever they're signed in. 
We have no way to force the third party applications to stop using plaintext passwords. 
There are a few approaches we have considered:

Don't ever send passwords or authentication tokens up. 
When a user signs in on a new device, they'll need to re-enter/authenticate the device for each third party service. 
Advantage: Secure, no risk of password/token compromise.
Disadvantage: Difficult for users. 
Encrypt the sensitive information using a client-certificate or hardware token. 
When a user wants to sign in, they provide the certificate/hardware token. 
Advantage: Very secure.
Disadvantage: Huge barrier to entry, difficult to impossible for not-for-profit app to implement. 
Encrypt the sensitive information using a password that the user provides
When a user signs in on a new device, they'll be prompted to provide a password.
If the password is incorrect, they need to re-enter/authenticate all the other devices. 
Advantage: Secure, if the user provides a strong password.
Disadvantage: If a user resets their password, they need to re-auth the device for all the third-party applications. 
Encrypt the sensitive information on our servers.
Advantage: Easy for users.
Disadvantage: Only marginally more work than plaintext for anyone that grabs the settings tables. 
Don't bother encrypting anything. (Plaintext storage) 
Advantage: Easy for users.
Disadvantage: Easy for anyone that grabs our DB to get all the user's passwords/auth-tokens. 

My question is: Is there a better approach that we have not yet considered?
","OK this is a multifaceted question.  You have to consider both the security of the information as it is being transmitted across the Internet as well as when it is on your servers. 
With regard to case 1, of course it is good not to risk the exposure of passwords, but the application you've created is meant to be convenient for users.  IF done correctly, the information can be passed  securely without risk of exposure.  However, that in mind, implementing cryptography correctly is not a feat that should be taken lightly.  In fact, when I say that you should never implement your own cryptography, but use existing time-tested cryptographic libraries paying attention to use them correctly.
As for bullet number two, while you are correct that you should not implement the cryptography yourself, there are many programs and libraries for generating public and private keys and using them to secure information.
You 100 percent need to encrypt the information stored in your database.  Every server is insecure given enough time/motivation.  Encrypted information however, is possible of being computationally infeasible of decrypting without the appropriate information.

"26221413","Public Key Integrity - Man in the middle attack","I want to license my product.
The question is about validation and making sure that public key is not changed so is the certificate (Man in the middle attack).
What I have planned so far is;

I give my EXE with license key and signed certificate (signed with private key) to the customer.
when customer enters license key, my EXE will validate it using public key (generating hash code, then decrypting certificate to get other hash code and compare)

Now problem is; if someone reverse engineers the EXE, changes the public key with his own public key and get a new certificate generated with his own private key. Then the EXE will always validate the certificate and my EXE is hacked.
Is this possible? If yes, what could be the solution to be sure my public key is not changed?
NOTE: There is no internet connection involved.
","To ensure integrity of something (executable, for example), sign it (or critical parts of it) with private key and check that the signature is valid every time you start the application.
Someone with enough time could of course figure out how the signature is done and replace that as well. They could bypass the check altogether. The only cure for that is encryption. But someone with enough time could work out the decryption algorithm...
The common way is to protect your license is to bind the software to some hardware, such as USB dongle, TPM or HDD serial number. This still does not guarantee that a determined hacker will not bypass your licensing.
There is no 100% protection against hackers. All you have to do is make it uneconomical for your users to hack it. Make the effort to hack a good deal more expensive than you are charging for the product. Make licensing terms very explicit and warn about risk of prosecution in case of breach. Build in reporting mechanism for suspected breaches so you can go after them.

I have setup a certificate authority on the receiving server, allowing me to issue a certificate that we have installed on the receiving server and on the calling server. I have also added this certificate authority as a trusted authority on the calling server's  certificate root store. 
The problem I am having right now is that when I set IIS to ""require"" a certificate, I can only send a small dataset, 25 rows at a time, with about 25 fields per row, maybe 100 chars long each. The data I am sending is already encrypted with a symmetric key. When I remove the requirement for a client certificate the amount of data I can send becomes about 25000 rows. When do this with the client certificate ""required"", I get

HTTP 413: Request entity too large 

My best guess is that the requirement turns on asymmetric encryption both ways, making the amount of data grow exponentially. I have tried modifying the web.config, specifically 
<httpRuntime targetFramework=""4.5""  maxRequestLength=""20000000"" executionTimeout=""3600"" />

but this seems to have no effect, even when sending 50 rows in a dataset.
I would also like to add 
maxBufferPoolSize=""2147483647"" maxReceivedMessageSize=""2147483647"" maxBufferSize=""100000""

but I am not sure where it goes.
I send the client certificate using 
Dim S as new webmethodname.webmethod
Dim x509 As X509Certificate = X509Certificate.CreateFromCertFile(""filelocation"")
            s.ClientCertificates.Add(x509)

The two solutions I can think of are

Raise the data limit even more or find the field limit that’s
stopping me     
Send smaller batches at a time.
Abandon use of client certificates for this purpose and seek another solution.

Any advice on the proper way to do this, or information on what exactly is happening behind the scenes from server to server using SSL and PKI would be appreciated.

Original Data : 'Manchester United'
The strange thing is that if I encrypt a string with the Java code it can be decrypted at the WCF service end, however, if it is encrypted using the above Android code, the decryption provides the error: ""The data to be decrypted exceeds the maximum for this modulus of 128 bytes"".
On debugging, I realized that the byte[] cipherData is not the same for Android and Java. All the previous values happen to be in sync. This generates different Encrypted Strings in Java and Android.
My question is why does this happen? Is there a silly mistake? Is there a way to work around it? Or something else that can be done in Android to get the 'Cipher Data' right?
Any help will be appreciated.

Only using RSA allows for MITM-attacks  (if I'm not misstaken), so I was thinking encrypting the public keys with AES (the key that both have agreed upon) before sending them to respective parties *
I'm currently trying to build two applications that talks with eachother. To secure the exchanged messages I was thinking on using RSA where each application has it's own set of keys.
Before communication is started between the two applications they do need to exchange keys. That shouldn't be a problem but I was thinking on using AES to encrypt the public keys before sending them over the internet.
I know what the word public (as in public key) means but I was thinking that this would see to that the right application/computer gets the key and no one else. 
So I want to exchange keys and to protect them from MITM attacks.
If anybody could give a better suggestion (I'm using the LibCrypto library btw), I'm all ears.
Thank you.

","This question shows many misconceptions from your part.

I know what the word public (as in public key) means but I was
  thinking that this would see to that the right application/computer
  gets the key and no one else.

I think this is the real problem you have and ask.
Which I think is: How can you know that you are using the public key of the entity you actually want to communicate with and not the public key of a malicious entity claiming to be the who you want to communicate with?  
This problem is solved in a typical installation by certificates signed by a trusted authority and issued to the specific entity i.e. IP or DNS name.  
In your case you haven't given any details of your certificates.  
You could just as well manually pre-install them and use them for your secure connections.  
If you follow some other plan e.g. symmetric encryption then your would start asking other questions e.g. how do you securely share the secret key etc

"3369354","Which it better?  Pre-generate asymmetric keys or generate them in real-time?","Assuming a keystore is secure and one needs to service around a million keys, is it better to generate asymmetric keys in real-time or is it better to generate a bunch of keys and store them to be used as and when required? 
Edit 1: By real time I mean generate a key pair when a user registers for the first time, from then on that key pair is used for all communication with the user.  
","Asymmetric keys have a public part and a private part; the public part is used to perform the operation which complements that which is done with the private part (e.g. you sign with the private key, and you verify the signature with the public key; or you encrypt data with the public key, and decrypt it with the private key). The point of asymmetric keys is that the private and public parts can be known by distinct entities; namely, that the public part is, well, public (everybody knows it) while the private part remains private.
Consequently, generating an asymmetric key ""in real-time"" makes little sense in most situations: what gives some value to a private key is that the public key is already known to some other party.
One can still imagine some situations in which ""real-time"" generation of asymmetric keys can be of use. For instance, SSL connections using one of the ""ephemeral Diffie-Hellman"" cipher suites: the DH keys, which can be called ""asymmetric"", are generated for each connection, the public part being then signed by the server (with another asymmetric key, which is not generated on-the-fly: the public key is the one in the server certificate) and then sent to the connecting client. In such a situation, pre-generating DH key pairs and storing them could be viewed as a kind of optimization, but a bad one since DH key pair generation is very fast, and private key storage is a complex and delicate issue.
Edit: if your problem is about key generation upon user registration vs key generation and storage in advance: assuming that server-side key generation is indeed what you want, key generation and storage in advance is worthwhile only as an optimization, if on-the-fly generation proves to be too expensive to handle peaks (occasionally, many users trying to register at the same time). I suggest that you try and bench and make sure that the problem really exists, before implementing a ""solution"", because private key secure storage is somewhat tricky. RSA key generation is quite fast (on a basic PC, you can easily generate a dozen RSA keys per second), and with discrete-log (DSA, Diffie-Hellman, El-Gamal) or elliptic-curve based cryptosystems, it is even considerably faster (e.g. ten thousands new EC key pairs per second, with a PC).

"43818917","Asymmetric Key not matching Enhanced Strong Name","So I have scoured much of the internet for answers. I have successfully created a template for deploying the CLR Assemblies to multiple (over 100) SQL Server instances and servers using simple strong names and certificates in a programmatic way...without even requiring the use of an IDE like VISUAL STUDIO except for syntax and checking assemblies. :)
The only catch seems to be the public key I am signing it with, since the C# Compiler csc.exe uses a SHA-1 hash to sign assemblies. So the only workarounds are either using Enhanced Strong Naming or MSBuild (not really an option here).
Enhanced Strong Naming is a simple enough process:

Create the Strong Name Key (snk) file:
sn.exe -k [RSA_Length] CLR_IdentityKey.snk 
Publish the public key and hash this with SHA-2
sn.exe -p CLR_IdentityKey.snk CLR_PubKey.snk sha256
Delay Sign your assembly with the public key (the source of csc.exe dictates the .NetFramework compatibility of your assembly)
csc.exe /target:library /keyfile:CLR_PubKey.snk /out:CLR_Assembly.dll ""YourCSFiles.cs"" ""YourCSFiles2.cs"" ""YourCSFiles3.cs"" /DelaySign+
And then Resign the Assembly with the original key with the StrongName tool.
sn.exe -Ra CLR_Assembly.dll CLR_IdentityKey.snk

The primary reason for wanting to sign my assemblies with the Enhanced Strong Name method is twofold: 

Avoid exposing the private key on multiple servers for any length of time.
Provide the alternate of publishing the hashed public snk with the option of setting an encrypted password when creating ASYMMETRIC KEY.

Note that although I could accomplish this using both a pfx and a simple snk file, the assembly here is a simple HTTP POST action, and the cost of a certificate is prohibitive given its small use in a intranet environment.
Now Checking the signed assembly, I see the following in the manifest:

Public key (hash algorithm: sha256):

So obviously sn.exe has successfully signed the assembly with the SHA-2 method.
Unfortunately, when I attempt to create my Asymmetric key based on this signed assembly in SQL Server, it seems public key is incorrectly associated.

Why is SQL Server unable to find the correct public key when they are supposedly one and the same?

If you temporarily set your database to TRUSTWORTHY ON so that you can load the Assembly then you should be able to see the issue.
SELECT * FROM sys.asymmetric_keys;
SELECT * FROM sys.assemblies;

After running those you should see that the ""thumbprint"" column of sys.asymmetric_keys does not match the ""publickeytoken"" property shown in the ""clr_name"" column of sys.assemblies. This is most likely due to using SHA-256 when running sn -p, but you have no choice about that as SHA-1 does not work for Enhanced Strong Naming. The ""thumbprint"" of the Asymmetric Key is SHA-1 and you have no control over that, hence no way to make them match.

Does anyone know of a working example of getting delayed assemblies in SQL Server?

As luck would have it, the documentation for Enhanced Strong Naming mentions using the AssemblySignatureKeyAttribute attribute to allow some legacy scenarios to work, and this certainly could be one. And in fact, using that attribute does indeed allow Enhanced Strong Naming to work.
Steps to get Enhanced Strong Naming working with SQLCLR (tested on SQL Server 2016 SP1):

Create the Identity and Signature key pairs:
sn -k 2048 IdentityKey.snk
sn -k 2048 SignatureKey.snk

Extract the public key from both key pairs:
sn -p IdentityKey.snk IdentityPubKey.snk
sn -p SignatureKey.snk SignaturePubKey.snk sha256

Note that the Identity key is not using sha256, hence using the default sha1, while the Signature key is using sha256.
Generate the publicKey and counterSignature values needed for the AssemblySignatureKey attribute:
sn -a IdentityPubKey.snk IdentityKey.snk SignaturePubKey.snk

Copy two values generated in the prior step into one of the source files (i.e. typically AssemblyInfo.cs):
[assembly:System.Reflection.AssemblySignatureKey(
""public"" +
""key"" +
""value"",
""counter"" +
""Signature"" +
""value""
)]

Compile the Assembly with delayed signing:
csc /target:library /out:MyAssembly.dll SqlStoredProcedure.cs
      /keyfile:IdentityPubKey.snk /delaySign+

Re-sign the Assembly:
sn -Ra MyAssembly.dll SignatureKey.snk

In SQL Server, create the Asymmetric Key in master from the DLL:
USE [master];

CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY [MyAsymKey]
FROM EXECUTABLE FILE = N'C:\path\to\MyAssembly.dll';

Create the Login from that Asymmetric Key and grant it either the EXTERNAL ACCESS ASSEMBLY or UNSAFE ASSEMBLY:
CREATE LOGIN [MyAsymKeyLogin]
FROM ASYMMETRIC KEY [MyAsymKey];

GRANT UNSAFE ASSEMBLY TO [MyAsymKeyLogin];

You only need to grant one of them as UNSAFE implies EXTERNAL ACCESS, but as of SQL Server 2017, if you are using the default configuration of clr strict being enabled, then this needs to be UNSAFE ASSEMBLY.
Change to the target Database and create the Assembly:
USE [Test];
ALTER DATABASE CURRENT SET TRUSTWORTHY OFF; -- Just to be sure!

CREATE ASSEMBLY [MyAssembly]
FROM N'C:\path\to\MyAssembly.dll'
WITH PERMISSION_SET = UNSAFE;



P.S. Your other concerns are mostly non-issues:

Not sure how you think that the private key could be exposed, but it is not part of the ASYMMETRIC KEY (since it is being created from an assembly) so there is no potential for that.
Setting a password via CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY is not an option since the private key is not there (since it is being created from an assembly).
If you prefer to use a Certificate there is no cost as a self-signed Certificate (via MAKECERT or PowerShell) is fine, especially for this being a small, internal project. A benefit of going with a Certificate is that you can create it from hex bytes instead of a file or Assembly, and since you can also create the Assembly from hex bytes, your install script can be completely portable as it won't have any file system references :-).

"42966964","How can I use version 2.0 of PHPSeclib to get a signed string as I did in version 1.0?","There is one project I worked on where a teammate added phpseclib (for php5) and we use the code below to sign an encrypted string and send that with a request to an internal API for verification processes.
function GetSignature($message) {
    $rsa = new Crypt_RSA();
    $sPath = PRIVATE_KEY_FILE; //defined elsewhere
    $sKey = file_get_contents($sPath);
    $rsa->LoadKey($sKey);
    $rsa->setSignatureMode(CRYPT_RSA_SIGNATURE_PKCS1);
    return $rsa->sign($message);
};

For a string that contains a timestamp concatenated with a URL (e.g. 1490239371+https://api-domain/api/endpoint), that would generate a string like below. This string is sent in a request header and the string below is the output in the internal API's console log.

In a newer project, I am attempting to recreate this because we need to utilize the same internal API. The newer project is utilizing composer (and laravel) so adding phpseclib to it added version 2.0. The constants have been changed to class constants but other than that it appears the methods are identical. Below is the code I added to replicate the former code in the other codebase.
use phpseclib\Crypt\RSA as Crypt_RSA;
class EncyptionController {

    public static function GetSignature($message) {
        $rsa = new Crypt_RSA(); 
        $path = config('app.encryption_key_path') . '/certs/private.pem';
        $rsa->loadKey(file_get_contents($path));
        $rsa->setSignatureMode(Crypt_RSA::SIGNATURE_PKCS1);
        return $rsa->sign($message); 
    }

With the newer code, a string of the same format would yield an encrypted string that contains unicode characters. The string below appears in the internal API's console log (when logging the value received in the request headers).

=���˭\u0003�uʂ\u000e_\u0013\u000bd)w�8�\u0018�����q

Logging that in Laravels log shows it with the unicode characters (without the entities encoded - I opened it in notepad++):

=žšîË­´uÊ‚_d)wË8ƒ”ñ‘¤úqýÁ‹þ:‹dºäÿLÈ?!F§?…ãIEìê*K®gUþèÎÅ  

And then the internal API decrypts the encoded string using the public key. For the newer codebase this fails. The internal API is implemented in Nginx/NodeJS and uses crypto and its verifier.verify() method.
Update:
Based on the comment by Álvaro González, it has come to light that the version 2.0 sign() method returns a raw binary hash. I can use base64_encode() to base-64 encode it, but the string is quite a bit shorter (88 characters) than the strings produced by version 1.0 (172 characters).
return base64_encode($rsa->sign($message));

","In v2.0 it's RSA() - not Crypt_RSA(). http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/2.0.html elaborates.
Anyway, in base64 decoding your two ciphertext's and then getting the length of each...  the first one (the one produced by phpseclib-php5) I get 256 bytes or 2048 bits. The second one (the one produced by phpseclib 2.0) is 64 bytes of 512 bits.
I think you're using different keys of different lengths for each one and that'd definitely affect the length.

Normally the client is a windows program (maybe C#/.Net windows programs - not Java/Ruby) which should generate a varying encrypted key in each call to the webservice based on a key/salt - while my server side would always be able to decode it with the private key. Knowledge of the encrypted token on the wire should not allow a third-party program to simply replicate the fully encrypted token and access the webservice. I am looking into OpenSSL but am a newbie to cryptography. The string being encrypted for identification could be (among other items) the MAC ID of the trusted client, which when decrypted would match the stored value on the server side of the trusted hosts.
I've found lots of possibilities on the Ruby side, but need to ideally ensure that the solution does not impose (or minimizes) any library or installation requirement on the windows client side. What i'm most struggling with is a way to generate a new key each time the call is made, so that anyone sniffing the traffic cannot simply infer the mode to create the encrypted tag by getting access to the key.
","As you are authenticating the caller here and not necessarily just the contents of what they send, there's no need to put the authentication mechanism into the SOAP request. Others have tried to do what you are after with WS-Security, so if at all, I'd go with that.
There have been problems with the security of the scheme, though, but probably the biggest deal breaker is that there's no support for it available in Ruby (that I know of at least, please correct me if I'm wrong!).
Probably the easiest way to achieve client authentication on both ends would be using mutually authenticated TLS (the former SSL). This will ensure authentication on the transport level, which should suffice in your case. Actual authentication will then happen by first checking the validity of the certificate that is sent by the client (Ruby OpenSSL takes care of that for you), and once that is established, you check it against a white list of known certificates that you maintain on your server. 
Please don't invent your own scheme, cryptographic protocols are among the hardest things to get right (that's why there are problems with WS-Security), TLS is probably as good as it gets right now and it has broad support in any language.

","You can generate secure symmetric keys from an email address, any string for that matter, with a key derivation function such as PBKDF2 (aka Rfc2898DeriveBytes).
RSA is asymmetric encryption with separate keys for encryption and decryption, symmetric encryption such as AES uses one key for both encryption and decryption.
Asymmetric encryption  such as RSA has the advantage of two keys where the encryption key can be publicly known. But it is very slow and the data size, the keys are large (2048-bits is a currently secure size) and the data length is limited to the key size, it is generally used to encrypt symmetric keys. There is no control over symmetric key pair creation other than length.  Use asymmetric encryption only when a public/private key pair must be used.
Asymmetric encryption such as AES is fast, has smaller keys with 128-bits common and secure and can handle data of essentially any length.

Is there any documentation that explains what are the mathematical algorithms used in PGP to encrypt a message (key generation, converting a message into a number, signature...) ?

For example, suppose that I have a friend who is using a third-party software to encrypt and decrypt messages with PGP, and I want to send him a message, e.g. ""Hello my friend!"", and I want to encrypt the message myself without using a third-party software. How do I generate my pair of keys, and how do I calculate the signed-encrypted message ?
I aware about asymetric encryption, DSA, RSA, SHA-1, etc... but I can't find any documentation about PGP algorithm.
","PGP and some other derivated software initially used a closed file format. This was a problem, so P. Zimmermann (that wrote and first published the software named PGP in year 1991) wrote a RFC (with co-authors W. Stallings and D. Atkins), titled PGP Message Exchange Formats published in year 1996 by the IETF: this RFC number is ... 1991 (easy to remember: PGP first published in 1991, RFC number 1991, repeat after me, ...).
Note that this RFC is not a standard: it is only an informational document. Nobody should claim conformance to it. It has been published only because, as stated by Postel, Huitema, and Crocker in RFC-1796: Rather Document Than Ignore.
This RFC has been obsoleted by RFC-2440, titled OpenPGP Message Format, and this one is a standard. The latter has been obsoleted by RFC-4880, with same title and same category (standards track). And finally, RFC-5581 added some minor updates to RFC-4880. These specifications explain which algorithms are used and how to use them to format messages.
There are many implementations of this format and cryptographic operations. You will even find JavaScript implementations. A notable online service that lets your browser use JavaScript to manage Open PGP messages is available here: https://keybase.io This is not an implementation of a protocol: you have to copy/paste the  encoded ciphertext to you mail user agent, for instance, if you want to send OpenPGP messages built with the help of this service.

","The easiest way is message security using client and server certificates. The best way is to import the client certs in your server machines and hard code the client cert thumbprint in the app.config file. The other way is negotiation of certs which I haven't tried before.

"4418256","RSA- Blinded message scheme still vulnerable?","I know this is more or less an algorithm or design problem and not so much programming, but I hope it's alright.
I am using a blinded message and having it signed by C. After the signing I want to remove the blinding and have other users A and B be able to share the message. Is this safe or can the signer still read these messages if they have the public and private keys? Should I take further steps after unblinding to ensure the confidentiality? 
I have read various math formulas explaining how this works, but I am more of a programmer than a mathematician. I want to ensure the confidentiality and I am not sure if it's working.
","Signatures do not ensure confidentiality. If you have data which must be transmitted but should remain confidential, then you must use a transmission mechanism which ensures confidentiality.
You apparently also want the message to be signed by entity C, but without giving any clue on the message to C. Generally speaking, the signing entity only needs to know the hash of the signed data. The signer may then try to ""guess"" the data by hashing potential messages and see if one matches the hash it received. This is the point where blind signatures come into action: to prevent the signer from even seeing the hashed message.
It so happens that with RSA, the hashed message can be recovered from the signature and the signer's public key. The signer (C) certainly knows his own public key. Hence, the signature itself must be kept confidential (otherwise, it would make no sense to use blind signatures in the first place). Thus, whatever mechanism you use to keep the message itself confidential when it is transmitted from A to B, must also be applied to the signature (and the signature is not that mechanism).

","I haven't digested all your code; I stopped when I saw you trying to decrypt with the public key, and encrypting with the private key. That's sort of like a digital signature, but your padding will be all wrong and you should use the Signature class if that is what your really want to do.
The public key is used to encrypt, or to verify a digital signature. Use the private key to decrypt, and see if that resolves your problem.

You are still doing it wrong. Don't call it ""encryption"" if the key isn't private.
But anyway, I think the printing to stdout looks wrong because you are converting the entire buffer to text. The last block is likely to be padded, so it won't decode to valid text—it's padding; it wasn't part of the input file, and you aren't writing it to the decrypted file, but you are printing it. 
Change to encrypt with the public key, decrypt with the private key, and then change your printing to this: 
System.out.print(new String(data, 0, theByte));

Even better would be to specify the character set of the data (probably UTF-8, since it's the default for XML).

KeyPair key = keyGen.generateKeyPair();

String publicKeyPath = new String(""publicKeys.txt"");

cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding"");

And on each method in client: 
cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding"");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, publickey); 
byte[] cipherText = cipher.doFinal(str.getBytes());

On server side:

cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, privateKey);
byte[] newPlainText = cipher.doFinal(arg.getBytes());

This gives the padding problem of ""Data must start with a zero""
There is only one KeyPair generated, for debug, I tried to encrypt and decript on the same function, and the problem relies on the conversions from byte[] to String.
I don't really wan't to change the passing of arguments to other type since operations are auto generated and all code is to strings. I've tried with different ""UTF-8"" and ""UTF-16Le"" but none works :S
Any idea?
","Encrypting data directly with asymmetric keys isnt a good idea and it does not work. RSA keys cannot encrypt data bigger than its key length. So, the right way of doing that would be to generate a symmetric key and encrypt the data with the symmetric key and inturn encrypt the symmetric key with the asymmetric key. So, you need to send the encrypted data and the encrypted key both to the other party.
If you try encrypting the data directly with the asymmetric key then your byte[] may not contain the correct data or it may contain nothing at all. This happens if your data is bigger than the key length. For data smaller the key length it works fine but not with bigger data.

I know asymmetric encryption is super expensive in use of resources, but I intend to encrypt and decrypt a text file with some passwords (let's say 200-300 characters in total).
I've done some research but I could only find how to encrypt and decrypt little short strings.
In case that's not possible/convenient, would you recommend using mixed encryption? I mean using asymmetric to ""securely transfer the pass phrase "" and the decrypting the rest with symmetric.
I intend to have the encrypted file in the cloud, so I can download it everywhere I am. To decrypt, I'll have a USB flash drive I take everywhere I go. In the USB I should have my private key, and the decryption script. I plan to decrypt ""inside the USB"" so the decrypted file is never stored in any computer.
Is that possible?

"18029704","Asymmetric cryptography with reversed key roles","I'm trying to implement licensing system for a software to prevent piracy.
For this I need to read a license file within the application, and I need to make sure this file is written by the owner company.
Asymmetric cryptography has good potential for this aim, but in other way around!
Asymmetric cryptography algorithms, like RSA, give you a Public key and a Private key which are used as follow:

Private keys are used to decrypt.
Public keys are used to encrypt.

But I need them like this:

Private keys to be used to encrypt.
Public keys to be used to decrypt.

A simplistic idea would be to switch the role of public and private keys, but there are posts saying that in RSA public keys can be generated from private ones which make this idea impractical.
So here's my question: Is there any asymmetric cryptography with reversed key roles?
","If speaking about RSA public/private key pair  can be used in both cases you described. When you use private key to encrypt then public key decrypts and vice-versa.
As you said public key can be derived from private key but not the other way.
If you want to prove the origin of licensing file, use RSA in signature mode. In signature mode a hash is computed from the data you want to protect and then encrypted using private key. The result -the digital signature - is appended to the protected data.
Verification process starts by decrypting the signature which gives you the hash. Then compute hash value from the data. Computed and decrypted value shall be the same.
There are a lot of libraries providing comfortable way of signature creation and verification. You can choose depending on the platform you use for your application development.

"52403984","Using a pre-existing private key to sign file to create a certificate (C#)","I have read round all the articles on StackOverflow and while a lot of them come close to the solution I want, none appear to work.
I simply want to take an existing private key to create a signature of a piece of data.  This then becomes part of a data file which includes a header describing the parameters used.   Next comes the signed version of a datafile, lastly the datafile itself (a hex file).  Concatentation of files is not the issue, generating a certificate using the private and public key pairs I have is. The keys are of the format (""-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----"")   I can generate signature files easily enough from scratch, but the software that will read the final file is expecting a 256 bye signature, whereas mine (using RSA-256) is only producing 32 byte signatures.  It only has access to the public key for decryption and validation of the file signature.  
I have come up across a number of errors such as keysets not being valid, not existing, the ComputeHash function not working and causing a crash.  I suspect I need to provide more information to my RSACryptographicService through CSPParameters but am not sure what is necessary and sufficient to do so. 
I would like to avoid digging into the mathematics behind the algorithm such as manually setting/reading the modulus / P/Q values etc.  Can anyone propose a simple way to do this or tell me where I am going wrong?  Code is available on request.
","The comments you are getting saying 256-byte signature is too long are absurd. Ignore those.
256 bit (32 bytes) would be a very small signature, that cannot be correct. I believe what you're actually looking for is 2048-bit (256-byte) RSA signatures. Those are more sensible by today's standards (though a step larger doesn't hurt).
In terms of importing your key, and not setting key components manually, you should look into ""PEM"" format RSA keys. There are several nuget packages out there to handle them. Otherwise you can strip the header/footer and decode the base64 yourself and import the key components with some of the built in X509 classes.
.NET does not natively support PEM format keys, and as such, I recommend using a reputable crypto library such as BouncyCastle, as they support PEM key parsing in their RSA algorithms.
This existing stackoverflow link describes how to import keys in BouncyCastle:

"32469648","How many times can AesCryptoServiceProvider.GenerateIV be safely called before exhausting the number of unique IVs?","I am confused. According to the below my IV ""MUST"" be unique for every round of encryption.

Properties of an IV depend on the cryptographic scheme used. A basic
  requirement is uniqueness, which means that no IV may be reused under
  the same key. For block ciphers, repeated IV values devolve the
  encryption scheme into electronic codebook mode: equal IV and equal
  plaintext result in equal ciphertext. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector

I am using the .NET AesCryptoServiceProvider class. I am using GenerateIV to generate a new IV and sending that IV along with the cipher text to a remote endpoint which will then decrypt the packet using the IV and privately shared key.
My packet is XML, and thus will always start with the same leading text. (e.g. ""<SomeTag ...>unique_text</SomeTag>"")
My key might live over thousands of encrypt/decrypt cycles during the five to ten minute life of the key. How many times can I call GenerateIV before I generate the same IV twice? Or phrased another way, how many cycles is GenerateIV good for? Five, ten, hundreds, thousands, millions?
Here is the code in question:
_sessionKeys[_currentSessionKeyId].GenerateIV();
var key = _sessionKeys[_currentSessionKeyId].Key;
var iv = _sessionKeys[_currentSessionKeyId].IV;

ICryptoTransform encryptor = _sessionKeys[_currentSessionKeyId].CreateEncryptor(key,iv);

It seems that given that the IV generated by AesCryptoServiceProvider.GenerateIV is of finite size, then the number of times it can be called before generating a duplicate IV is also finite. But what is that finite number.
","There is 128 bits (16 bytes) in a IV. According to the Wikipeda page on the Birthday Attack (the probability you will see a repeated value pulling randomly from a pool) to have a 0.0000000000000001% chance of seeing any number twice you must call the function about 26,000,000,000 times. To get it to be a 1% chance any number is seen twice you must call it 2,600,000,000,000,000,000 times.
This assumes GenerateIV has a ""good"" random number generator that gives a even distribution, which it should have.

However, after reading a lot on the net, I found that one of the major flaws of public-private-key algorithms is that recorded data can be decrypted as soon as the recipients private key is leaked.
To avoid that, the use of Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) is suggested and I'm wondering, if Libsodium is already supporting PFS in the former mentioned function as individual nonces are used for each encryption.
Maybe someone can guide me on the difference between PFS and Libsodiums functions (if there are some) or help me by clarifying the relationship of nonces and PFS.
","There is no forward secrecy.
crypto_box_seal() is slightly better, as the sender uses ephemeral keys. These messages can be signed using a long-term secret key in order to check that they come from the expected party, but that key being compromised will not allow decryption of previous messages.
However, if the recipient's secret key get compromised, recorded messages can still be decrypted.
For these reasons, the box construction doesn't exist in libhydrogen. Instead, there are Noise-based protocol implementations for secure key exchange, all with forward secrecy. These APIs will be backported to libsodium at some point.
But secure chat applications are far from trivial to build. The signal library is a much better starting point, even though the license may not be compatible with your expectations.

"6429048","Exchanging Symmetric Keys","I have a WinForms client that is sending encrypted data to a web service.  The WinForms client creates a Symmetric RijndaelManaged sessionKey and also has a ""hard-coded RSA asymmetric public key"".
I am using the EncryptedXml class which makes it really easy to package up my data.
The Web Service has both the private and public keys ""hardcoded"" and can successfully decrypt the SessionKey and then use it to decrypt the actual data I am sending.
This is pretty much handled automatically by the EncryptedData class.
The problem I am having is that on the Web Service end when I want to reply, I can't seem to figure out how to get the SessionKey that was sent over.  
Before I do any decrypting on the Web Service side, I can see the encrypted session key, but after I decrypt the XML, it's gone (and therefore I don't have any session keys for my reply).
Any ideas how I can get this unencrypted key?
","The reason that you cannot see the session key is that it is automatically decrypted and used. Normally it is considered part of the XML. If you want to get at it, just use
encryptedxml.decryptencryptedkey
And you should be alright. Note that for all the less important security warnings, the code represented here is vulnerable to both man in the middle attacks and to a lesser extend to padding oracle attacks. It should help against most eavesdropping attempts though.
Finally, reusing a session key is considered pretty bad security practice too. If you reuse it, at least consider using an IV, e.g. a counter for each followup message.

I understand you can use readily-available functions as discussed in this stackoverflow post. I am having trouble understanding how to protect the signing key however. If I sign an xml file to act as an integrity check on it's contents the user can easily disassemble my executable and get the key and/or the way the key is generated. What methods are available for me to easily protect the key? Key containers seem to be one option but I don't see how they protect the key and/or the method used to generate said key.
Thank you!
","When you load the key into a container you can specify that it is non-exportable. This will help protect it, but you will still need to store the file somewhere anyway, in case, for example, you get a new computer.
By the way, I did mention that marking it as non-exportable will help protect it, not guarantee its protection. It is still possible to extract a non-exportable key.
The only sure-fire method is to also ensure nobody has physical access to the computer. Physical access means you can do anything.
What this means in your case is the private key must be in a secure place as it is your digital signature. The public key to verify the signature is loaded into your program. It doesn't matter if your code is decompiled and the public key is extracted, as all it can be used for is to verify something was signed by your private key.
If somebody is going to the trouble to decompile your code to circumvent verification of the settings file, they will just change your code to skip the verification.

Use something like AES to encrypt the data
sign the encrypted data with RSA
send the encrypted + signed data to your client
since AES uses a shared key the client can decrypt the data
the client can verify the signature using the public RSA key

The drawbacks are :

The client can reproduced an encrypted message but it won't be signed (since only you have the private key).
the client can replace the public key on his end with his own key pair to sign/verify the message.

I know that .NET has support for public key encryption (RSACryptoServiceProvider), but the encrypted text gets so huge.
Would it work to instead  treat the private key as a public key?
Would Elliptic curve cryptography produce a smaller output?
","First of all, if you want to achieve confidentiality you should always encrypt with the public key, not the private key. RSA encryption is not defined for encryption with the private key, and the results may vary (especially the kind of padding that is applied).
For direct RSA encryption, the size of the encrypted message is identical to the modulus. Now the modulus should be at least 2048 bits by now, and your message is only about (27/3)*10=90 bits. So RSA would have a large overhead, independent on the key used. Using ECIES is therefore likely to give significant benefits.

","Yes it matters. If an attacker generates random numbers at the same time as a genuine user, they can predict what is generated and retrieve they key. Even if the clocks aren't fully synchronised, an attacker could generate a range around the UNIX timestamp when the key was known to have been generated and then try each one in turn.
Solution: Use window.crypto to generate a secure random number using the crypto library.

ASP.NET offers the possibility to encrypt sections in the web.config automatically. It seems it is not possible for WinForm applications to do that for the app.config. And this is true for a part: WinForms does not offer tools to configure it. But it can be done. It is all .NET. Isn't it? So how do we do it?

"2531015","Verify p2p node","Hey guys, I have been working on a p2p namespace for some of my programs.  I created a system to encrypt/decrypt the packets send/received with the class.  I was using the basic public private key system: 1) encrypt the data with Symmetric encryption 2) encrypt the symmetric key with RSA.  Then do the opposite when you decrypted..
I was wondering though, how would you verify if the packet was coming from where it said it was.  I was going to use a basic certificate system (where you encrypt with your private RSA key, then they decrypt it with your public key), but I don't know how to do this with C#.  I am using the RSACryptoServiceProvider class.
Does anyone know how do this?

","The standard protocol for sending packets securely is SSL/TLS. The RFCs for TLS and DTLS (and a fix for a recent flaw) are the way to go. They should also be considered a resource for those learning and looking for ideas.
It sounds like you're a looking for a MAC. A very efficient set of crypto primitives that perform both encryption and MACing at the same time are the AEAD ciphers, see for example CCM and GCM block cipher modes.
I do not believe .NET supports any AEAD ciphers. You can also use the slower but perfectly adequate HMAC algorithm which is supported in .NET, or you can use the bouncycastle C# library which does support AEAD ciphers.

"26536374","Asymmetric encryption with multiple decryption results","Edit
I am trying to develop a password managing tool for companies. My idea is that the passwords in some kind of database are encrypted with a master password which only the admin has.
Per department in a company there should be an own password, which lets the users of that department only access their passwords.
Lets look at an example.

Department A

Billing system, Password: ""Hello""

Department B

Mail, Password: ""World""


The passwords are encrypted with the master password of the admin. Lets just assume it is 0000. So in the database there would be something like this

Department A

Billing system, Password: encrypt(""Hello"",0000,'A')

Department B

Mail, Password: encrypt(""World"",0000,'B')


Furthermore, the password of department A would be 9999 and of department B 7777. Now I am searching for a possibility to decrypt the password of the billing system with the password 9999 and decrypt the mail password with 7777. But it should not be possible to decrypt the mail password with 9999 and vice versa.

Billing system: decrypt(encrypt(""Hello"",0000,'A'), 9999) = ""Hello""
Billing system: decrypt(encrypt(""Hello"",0000,'A'), 7777) != ""Hello""
Mail: decrypt(encrypt(""World"",0000,'B'), 9999) != ""World""
Mail: decrypt(encrypt(""World"",0000,'B'), 7777) = ""World""

Not that this it hard enough, the admin user must have the possibility to decrypt any password with his master password 0000

Billing system: decrypt(encrypt(""Hello"",0000,'A'), 0000) = ""Hello""
Mail: decrypt(encrypt(""World"",0000,'B'), 0000) = ""World""

I hope that my ideas are getting clearer now...
","Preface: you cannot design a cryptographic system without knowing its full intent and purpose, so me giving any snippet of advice may be wholly unsuitable for your eventual end goal. Also, you may rather want to ask the experts at http://security.stackexchange.com or http://crypto.stackexchange.com. Also, I have more of a general knowledge of cryptography and this is a general programming forum, so take the below with a grain of salt.

Having said that, the usual way to store one piece of information in an encrypted form but make it accessible to multiple parties using different passwords is to use intermediate encryption keys. You have your plaintext. You generate a random key and use that to encrypt the plaintext. You now encrypt the randomly generated key with the user's personal password and store the result.
plaintext  = 'Hello World'
key        = make_random_string(128)
ciphertext = encrypt(plaintext, key)
keys = {
    user1: encrypt(key, user1password),
    user2: encrypt(key, user2password),
    ...
}

To decrypt, you use the user's password to decrypt the key to then decrypt the actual information.
key       = decrypt(keys.user1, user1password)
plaintext = decrypt(ciphertext, key)

print plaintext

This indirection allows you to share the same piece of information among several users. In practice you'd probably use symmetric encryption to encrypt the plaintext with the random key, and asymmetric encryption to encrypt the random key with each user's public key. That means in practice, every time you generate a new random symmetric encryption key, the system needs to create a copy of it individually encrypted with each user's public key that should have access to it.
This also allows you to irretrievably revoke an individual user's access to a specific piece of information, simply by nuking that users version of the random encryption key.

"17012295","Encrypting data symmetrically and asymmetrically","As far as I have learned so far, asymmetric encryption is too costly for long data. Additionally, from a technical perspective, it's not even possible to encrypt arbitrarily large portions of data (the size of the data is limited by the size of the key being used).
As far as I know the usual workaround is to create a (random) key, use that key to encrypt the data symmetrically, and then only encrypt this key using an asymmetric algorithm.
Now I have two questions:

Is the approach I described so far correct?
What do I do with the encrypted key? Of course, I store or send the encrypted data somewhere, but what about the key? If I understand it correctly, I need to store this key as well, right?

","You are basically correct.  Create a random key.  Encrypt the key itself with the Public Key of the person at the other end, Bob.  Send Bob the encrypted key, which they will be able to decrypt with their Private Key.  This is the asymmetric encryption part.
You also use your key to encrypt that large amount of data (but not too large).  Now you send Bob the encrypted data.  Bob has the encrypted data and the (decrypted) key and so can use symmetric decryption to extract the data from the cyphertext you sent.
Once you have sent the data and key, you should probably securely destroy the key and not use it again unless you have a good reason to keep it.  Generate a new key the next time you need to send something.  Even if you are sending something to Bob again, use a new key.  Even if you are resending the same data to Bob again, use a new key.  Sending too much data on a single key can allow attacks on your data.

"34778931","How to use asymmetrical encryption to receive data in javascript?","I understand the concept of asymmetrical encryption in the context of the client wanting to send data securely to the server. The server sends a public key to the client that is used to encrypt the data. The server decrypts the message using it's private key. In this context, everything makes sense, since the private key is only accessible by the server.
But what if the client wants to receive data securely? The same concept could apply in the opposite direction (the front end shares the public key and possess the private key), except the private key would be available to anyone, since the source code in javascript is available in the web browser and it would defeat the purpose of encryption...
Surely there is a solution for this. When searching I have not found a clear answer to my question, although many people mentioned HTTPS. I would also like to know why and how does it work and where my knowledge is flawed.
How does a client securely receive data from a server?
","As you have already mentioned, HTTPS is the solution here.  You have already covered how this works but you are just missing a few key details.
HTTPS use asymmetric encryption to establish the initial encrypted communication.  Subsequent communication is actually performed using symmetric encryption as it is more performant and more secure for a smaller key size.  So the initial hand shake uses the server's public key to exchange a shared secret key that both the server and client will then use for all communication.
Additionally, the public key used by the server is generally signed by a trusted certificate authority whose key your browser already knows.  This allows your web browser to verify the server's public key so that you know that the communication has not been intercepted and altered by an attacker sitting between you and the server.  Otherwise an attacker could just intercept all communication and send you a different public key claiming to be the server's public key, and how would you know the difference?
Once the encrypted channel is established, anything the client sends to the server is encrypted, and likewise, anything the server sends to the client is encrypted.  The encryption guarantees here ensure both confidentiality and integrity of all communication.
So by using HTTPS, the client is securely receiving data from the server, as well as securely sending data to the server, all without embedding any keys directly into the Javascript code.

","SSL is just another layer of security (at least to some extent). Any CA is not inherently secure. You may want to use PKI along with the usual symmetric algorithms like this (a sample usage), where (depending on the data size - PKI serves to encrypt small data chunks) the public key encrypts preliminarily generated symmetric key (which encrypts some data) on the sender side and the private key on the receiver side decrypts the symmetric key (which on its turn decrypts the data).

Can a lua plugin for nginx read session data from postgre (or redis) and do the authorization checks with good performance?
Second question: How?
One possible solution I though about is using different certificate files (generated with passwords by django) to serve files as https. But I have no idea if it's possible to use different certificate files dynamically generated based on URI or not and I have no idea if nginx can serve files with asymmetric encryption over https or if https protocol supports it at all even if client is a custom client other than normal browsers than can parse data whatever way needed.
Another possible solution is writing a Lua plugin for Nginx but that'd be extremely expensive solution for me considering my resources. But I'd be thankful if someone could tell me if it's possible at all even with a custom plugin or not.

This is wrong and causes the observed error message. The following applies:

y.multiply(x.modInverse(p)).mod(p)

In the add method, the case: 

is not handled. Here, the add method must return zero (i.e. the point representing the point at infinity). Geometrically, this case corresponds to a vertical secant (2 intersections).
Analogously, the case

is not handled in the doublePoint method. Here, the doublePoint method must return zero as well. Geometrically, this case corresponds to a vertical tangent (1 intersection).
The mult method doesn't work. But with regard to the comment in the code this is probably known.
Testing is easier if a small prime finite field is used. Here you can specify elliptical curves and determine the corresponding points. Note, that a curve with b != 0 must be used, otherwise the point (0,0) is a regular point of the curve and could not be used as a representative of the point at infinity.

"51796225","Pros and cons of JWE Key Management Modes","I've been searching a lot but nothing hit the spot, they are questions about JWE key management.
Scenario:
Server wants to send sensitive data to client, and it chooses to encrypt the data with a symmetric algorithm by a symmetric key, i.e, Content Encryption Key (CEK).
Client will retrieve the CEK to decrypt the encrypted data, but the CEK can't be sent as a clear text together with the encrypted data, so the CEK will need to be encrypted.
Approach:
The JWE specification defines different key management modes as follows

Key Wrapping: the CEK is encrypted for the intended recipient using a symmetric encryption algorithm.
Key Wrapping Diagram
Key Encryption: the CEK is encrypted for the intended recipient using an asymmetric encryption algorithm.
Key Encryption Diagram
Direct Key Agreement: a key agreement algorithm is used to pick the CEK.

Key Agreement with Key Wrapping: a key agreement algorithm is used to pick a
symmetric CEK using a symmetric encryption algorithm.
Key Agreement with Key Wrapping Diagram
Direct Encryption: a user-defined symmetric shared key is used as the CEK (no key derivation or generation).

What are pros and cons of each mode?
Under what circumstance will each mode be preferable?

","That depends on if you have control of both the client and the server, how you're storing/fixing the key, and how difficult it is to deploy replacements to the client/server code. If it's not that difficult for you to do a re-deploy and you know that all instances of the client will be updated promptly I suppose you could just do a re-deploy if you ever needed to rotate the key.
However, if it's not that easy for you to do a re-deploy and/or you can't guarantee that all of the code will be updated promptly this could be a problem because you could be left without a method of rotating the key if your current one became compromised.
The other problem is that you don't really want to have all of your clients using the same private key, especially if you have a lot of clients. This increases the risk of your private key eventually being compromised and makes it more difficult for the server to verify the authenticity of individual clients. Additionally, this would create a single point of failure because if the private key is compromised, it would compromise the communications of all of the clients. If each client has its own private/public key, if its private key is compromised there's no impact on other clients so the damage would be much more contained. 
Using per-client keys, compromising a private key could only compromise communications for a single client that occurred since the last key rotation; if, for example, you're rotating keys every 3 months compromising a key can never compromise more than 3 months of communication for a single client. (On average, it would compromise 1.5 months of communication for that particular client).
Incidentally, maybe I'm misreading your question but it's not important with public-key cryptography that the public key remain secret, just that you have a way of protecting the private key. The .NET Framework does have key containers for the purpose of safely storing the private key.

","If you can protect the integrity of the client, it's safer to use a fixed public key than to magically bootstrap a secure connection from nothing.
Reading much into the question and comments, it sounds like you want to prevent a man-in-the-middle from decrypting messages from the client to the server. In order to do that, the client must be sure to use the server's public key, without getting tricked into using one generated by the man-in-the-middle.
If a public key is embedded in the client, and you have some mechanism to ensure that the key is authentic, you are safe. 
In a PKI-based application, this is done by using certificates issued by well-known CAs, and verifying them before use. In a homebrew scheme, you could compute a hash of the client application, transmit that securely to the client (on a download page served via HTTPS, over the phone or written by a trusted party, etc.), and verify that the downloaded application's hash matches the authentic hash before running.

"40876487","Private key compromised, how to distribute new public keys? Client server model via asymmetric key encryption","I'm attempting to setup client/server communication for an application via libsodium. So far I plan to distribute the application with a hard-coded public key. The server will keep its secret key without ever sharing it. This should let users encrypt messages and send them to the server, where the secret key decrypts messages.
In the event the secret key on the server is ever compromised (I'm not sure how, but just in case) how might one distribute new public keys to all clients? Is there a way to generate a new secret key without requiring distribution of new public keys? Something like:
make_new_secret( secret_buffer, previous_public );

I was hoping for a very simple solution that wouldn't require complicated algorithms for securely handing out new public keys. If making a new private key must be done while also making a new public key, what algorithms may be used to securely distribute public keys from server to clients?
Additional info (feel free to skip):
We can read here where Glenn Fiedler (author of libyojimbo, which uses libsodium) talks about the idea of ""just roll a new private key"".
If there is a way to re-use old public keys and create a new private key with libsodium, I would love to read about it. I have went through the docs and have yet to see any functions to do so. So I fear I may have to delve into more complicated algorithms for securely distributing new public keys.
I have checked out Diffie Hellman, but it seems to require both parties to start with a common ""color"". So I suppose my question is in regards to coming to a new agreed upon starting color.
","The public/private keys are always pair (with the exception of EC having 2 public keys which is essentially the same thing). So if your server private key is compromised or you decide to roll it you need the client to know your servers new public key.
The challenge is real. If you hardcode it, then you have to recompile/redistribute application to your clients.
I don't understand your whole use case but if you are trying to do authorization, please look into OAUTH2 which will allow you to issue temporary (configurable on the server) tokens from your server to you client. In this case you can revoke OAUTH token in case either server or client is compromised and you (your server) has full control over it.

The only given definitions are that public keyed encrypted message can only be decrypted by private key. To me, that's just nonsense and I will explain.
A website needs to be downloaded by your browser which also means that Javascript scripts and all the other stuff are accessible to anyone that catches your website if he wishes too. This also means that now, this person knows how you calculate your stuff with your public key making it possible WITHOUT the private key to decrypt it.
I'm just trying to figure out how this works and to me it does not make sens that you CANNOT decrypt an ecrypted text from a public key when you have access to all the calculations made from the side it encrypted.
I mean, when you send a password for example, first, on YOUR end, the browser's end, it encrypts the data to be recieved by the server. By encrypting the data from the browser's end, anyone that took a look on your source code can know how you encrypted it which now can be used to decrypt it. I am creating a new encryption system for our website where the server randomly creates a session key that can only be used by the user with the corresponding session. So only the 2 computers can talk to each other with the same key so if you use the same key on another computer, it just won't work as each key is stored for each session which the key dies after a set amount of time. With what I read, this seams to be called a symetric key system. I want to try and program my own assymetric key system but in all cases when I read, I can only figure out that no matter what happens as an encryption on the client's side, if a malicious person intercepts just before sending the information, he has access to how the encryption worked and therefor, does not need the private key on the server side as he just needs to reverse the process knowing how it was done on the client's side.
I'm starting to think myself as stupid thinking that way.
I'll add a little more information as I think we don't quite catch what I mean. When sending a password, say my name ""David"" and let's name our user WebUser. We will name our maleficient user BadGuy. So BadGuy hapopens to integrate himself in between WebUser and his browser. BadGuy also recieves ALL javascripts of the webpage permitting him to see how the calculations work before it is sent. WebUser enters his password ""David"" which is submitted to the javascript encryption system. Right off the bat, BadGuy does not need to decrypot anything as he already caught the password. BUT when the website responds, BadGuy has all the calculations and can use the receieved encrypted data and decrypt it using the decryption calculations he can see in the recieved web pages code.
So the only thing I can understand is that Assymetric keys are used for encryption which technically is decryptable using public known numbers. But in cas of RSA, these 2 numbers are so large that it would take years to figure out the known decryptor. As I can also undersnat is that it is pretty much easier to create the 2 numbers from the private number. But in any case, the encryption process usually ends up with a shared temporary intimate key between the two parties for for faster commuinication and that noone can ever prevent a BagGuy between User and Browser but with todays technocolgies, the real threat is more MiTM attacks where one will sniff the network. In all cases, there is no definate way to communicate 100% of the data in a undecryptable way as at least 50% of it is decryptable i/e data coming from one side or data going to the other side.
","Assymetric encryption has two keys, a public and a private key, as you correctly described, so don't feel stupid. Both keys can be used for encryption and decryption, however, if data encrypted by the public key can only be decrypted by the private key and data encrypted by the private key can only be decrypted by the public key.
As a result, in order to be successfully involved in a communication using assymetric encryption you will need to have both a public and a private key.
You share your public key with others, that is, whatever data you receive, it will be encrypted with the public key. You will subsequently be able to decrypt it using your private key, which is your secret. When you send data to the other side of the communication, you encrypt it using your private key and the other side, which has your public key will be able to decrypt it.
Consider the example of versioning. You are involved in a project with some team members. When you pull the commits of others, it is encrypted with your public key, so once it is downloaded at your end, you will be able to decrypt it via your private key. As you work and do your commits, you will push the changes into the repository, encrypted using your private key. The other side of the communication already has your public key and will be able to decrypt it. It is important that you do not share your private key with anyone, so your team-mates will not be able to impersonate you, committing malicious code in your name. You can share your public key with anyone, but it is recommended to share it only with trusted people, like your team-mates, so no one else will be able to decrypt anything encrypted by your private key.
Essentially your public key is a ridiculously large number, which is the result by multiplying two primes (private key). The two primes could be found out by prime factorization, but since the public key is a very very large number, doing the prime factorization would take such a looong time that no one will sit and wait for the time (centuries) while the factorization is being executed and the results are found out.
A session id is a value which identifies a session. If there is a single such value, then it is not an assymetric encryption, as there is no public and private key involved and once someone steals the session ID, as you correctly pointed out, the malicious third person/system can impersonate the actual user and do nasty things. So the problem you have identified actually exists, but this is not a new problem and solutions were implemented. The solution you are looking for is HTTPS. Once your site gets a proper certificate, you will be able to use assymetric encryption safe and sound. Under the hood the server will have the public key of the user's session, while the user will use the private key to encrypt/decrypt and if a middle man intercepts the public key of the session (which is not a session id), the malicious third person will not be able to impersonate the actual user.

","extending the previous answer

I'm just wandering how an attacker positionned between the user and his browser cannot intercept the connection details when they are clear texte to beggin with and to end with. 

The magic here is called DH key exchange.
The symmetric encryption key is derived using Diffie–Hellman key exchange, where the common encryption key is exchanged. 
Any ""listening"" party (your BadGuy) woudn't be able to derive the session key even by sniffing out the whole communications. The server will use its certificate and private key to make sure the client communicates with the legitimate target. This prevents an active ""man in the middle"" to pose as a false server.

it does not make sens that you CANNOT decrypt an ecrypted text from a public key when you have access to all the calculations made from the side it encrypted.

Asymmetric cryptography is based on so called ""trapdoor"" funtions. It means it is easy to calculate the function one way (e.g. encrypt data), but very difficult (not feasible) to od it opposite way without some secret value (private key). Indeed sometimes it is difficult to understand it and there are a lot of constraints under the asymmetric encryption is really secure. That's why you would always use some trusted library than do it yourself.

By encrypting the data from the browser's end, anyone that took a look on your source code can know how you encrypted it which now can be used to decrypt it.

Not without the random secret key, which is derived between the client and server during the key exchange (see the first paragraph).

I am creating a new encryption system for our website where the server randomly creates a session key that can only be used by the user with the corresponding session. 

It's one of the rules in the field of cryptography - do not design your own crypto! 
That's usually a bad idea. Please note the currently used secure channels (SSL, TLS, .. based on RSA, ECC) are designed, reviewed and used by a lot of smart people who know what they are doing, how to mitigate different attack vectors. And IMHO it is still not perfect, but it's the best we have.

","Of course you are getting garbage, this is your sequence:
Plaintext message -> Encrypt -> Encode -> Encoded message

Encoded message -> Decrypt -> Decode -> GARBAGE

You need to undo the Base64 encoding before you can decrypt the message, you are doing the reverse process in the incorrect order!
Edit
Actually its worse, this is your sequence:
Plaintext message -> Encrypt -> Encode -> Encoded message

Encrypted message -> Decrypt -> Encode -> GARBAGE

Try this:
Cipher c1 = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");
c1.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, publicKey);
encodedBytes = c1.doFinal(secretMessage.getBytes());
encodedMessage = Base64.encodeToString(encodedBytes, Base64.DEFAULT);

Cipher c2 = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");    
c2.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, privateKey)      
decodedBytes = Base64.decode(encodedMessage.toByteArray(), Base64.DEFAULT);
decryptedMessage = c2.doFinal(decodedBytes);

","It turns out that in my original code, decodedBytes contained the properly decrypted bytes.  The following command was turning decodedBytes into junk characters ...
decodedMessage = Base64.encodeToString(decodedBytes, Base64.DEFAULT);

I replaced that code with ...
String str = new String(decodedBytes, ""UTF-8"");

And this solved the problem probably because decodedBytes had never been Base64 encoded in the first place.
I also found that using straight RSA I can only encrypt a maximum of 245 bytes if I use a 2048 bit key.  less if I use a 1024 bit key.
If larger strings need to be encrypted using asymmetric Public/Private keys then I need to first encrypt a string using symmetric AES and then encrypt the AES key with the public RSA key and send both the encrypted AES key and the encrypted message over the wire where the receiver can decrypt the AES key using their private RSA key. The AES key can be randomly generated in the sending code.

"53972400","Why doesn't PyCrypto allow for encoding with the private and decoding with the public key to verify the sendersidentity","I've been playing around with the PyCrypto Library with the intention to make a system that works like this:

Create a RSA keyset for both the sender and the receiver and a seperate AES key
The sender:


Encrypts the message with the AES key using the ECB encryption mode ECB
Encrypts the AES key with the senders private key
Concats their own name to the result of the last step
Encrypts the result from the last step with the receivers public key
Combines the results from step 1 and 4 into 1 message and sends it to the receiver

And the receiver


Splits the message into the actual message and the double encrypted key (which also contains the senders name)
Decrypts the double encrypted key using their own private key
Uses the name of the sender to retrieve the senders public key
Decrypts the AES key with the senders public key
Decrypts the message with the AES key


But I'm having trouble with the double encryption. The problem is that I can't decrypt something with the public key when it is encrypted with the private key. I understand that it is because ARS isn't supposed to work backwards, but I want to do this to verify the senders identity to the receiver. I don't know how else to do this.

Normally, the browser (any browser) would start streaming the video file in it's built-in player, but since the data is encrypted, it doesn't know how to handle it.
The way the encryption is done is kind of like HTTPS. The server sends the front end a public key, the front end generates a symmetrical key with the public key and both the server and front end use it to encrypt/decrypt stuff.
I know that if I was using HTTPS, it would work, as an automatic process would occur between the server and browser. So I guess my question is how do I get the browser to display an encrypted video without using HTTPS?
","You must either use a video player that natively knows how to decrypt that format (contact the vendor of the back end), or put a piece of middleware in to decrypt the format (contact the vendor of the back end).  In both cases, you'll need the key as well.
Or log into the back end to change its settings (guess who you should contact).
Alternately, read the manual for the back end.

Any idea?

The public looks like an RSA key, therefore my issue is mostly trying all possible (mode,padding) combinations. Is there a way to iterate all possibilities? The other possibility is that a pre processing is applied to the clear text before encryption - any ""standard"" pre processing for a string before encryption?
","First of all, if the public key is provided, the algorithm is typically provided along with it (e.g. as another field within the certificate). Usually the intention is for any client to be able to use the public key, so providing the algorithm is consistent with that purpose.
If for some reason the key and its metadata have become separated, it is likely you can just look at the key's data structure and figure out the algorithm. For example, any key that is stored as an OpenSSH key will follow RFS 4523 which includes a header specifying the algorithim. An RSA public key will contain the exponent and modulus. An ECC key will contain two 32-byte numbers. Etc.

The other possibility is that a pre processing is applied to the clear text before encryption - any ""standard"" pre processing for a string before encryption?
","You're mixing terms from two different technologies. ""Mode"" and ""padding"" refer to symmetric ciphers, not asymmetric ciphers like public key cryptography. It's not necessarily wrong since the typical approach is to write the public key, then generate a random session key for a symmetric cipher (e.g., AES) and encrypt it using the public key, then encrypt the plaintext with the random session key, then finally add any message digest. (If you add an HMAC you should use a different keypair than then one used to encrypt a modified session key and it should be a digest of the ciphertext, not the plaintext.) The cipher and mode will be encoded somehow but it will almost certainly use magic values. (e.g., cipher 3, mode 1) and you'll be expected to know how to interpret those values.
Do you know what produced the ciphertext? Does it produce a standard format that you can find documented somewhere, or is it homebrew?
As for figuring out the details of the algorithm and mode from just the ciphertext all I can say is ""good luck"". The spooks may have tools to help figure this out but these ciphers are designed to produce output that looks like random data. Unless they're using ECB and have repeating plaintext it will be very opaque.

","That's an RSA key almost certainly.
But your approach will not work: if you encrypt the same message twice with RSA, you will get different results.  That's because RSA involves random padding (see PKCS #1), which is a requirement for the security of the design (to stop attacks like the one you are attempting) -- see footnote. 
Bottom line: You won't be able to tell how exactly it was encrypted with the information you have, assuming you don't make a cryptographic breakthrough.
Footnote: The security requirement that prevents what you are trying to do was detailed in the seminal cryptographic paper Probabilistic Encryption.  Among many requirements, they suggested that even if only a single bit was encrypted, you should not be able to brute force (i.e. try both 0 and 1 in this case) to see which value encrypts to the ciphertext that you captured.  The PKCS #1 standard was built with these considerations in mind.

when i want to send a new file for the clients to download (at well) i hash the file and encrypt the hash with the public key and store it as .sig file alongside the data file in a public shared folder.
now if one of the client users is malicious he can steal the private key from his machine.
the question is : provided that the public key is secret and this is the only use of that key pair and i absolutely don't need any encryption on the data file. does stealing the private key from a client compromise my public key? i.e can the malicious user craft a file signature so that the data file appear to be coming from me?
","I belive you've designed this backwards.You want to send the public key to the clients and keep the private to yourself. The public key is public; anyone should be able to know it. The private key is private; only the owner should know it.
Rather than hashing the file and encrypting the hash with the public key, you want to sign the file with your private key and let the clients use the public key to verify the signature. The signing operation performs the same idea as your ""encrypt the hash"" but is the standard construction, and your RSA tools likely include a signing function.

"55600954","How to decrypt data with public key","Similar questions were asked many times but I was looking for an answer for 2 days and didn't find what I'm looking for. First of all, I have fair understanding of public/private key security from consuming standpoint. I never looked into the mathematics behind it. I understand that normally you use a public key to encrypt data and a private key to decrypt it. I'm also aware of the other pair of operations: signing data with a private key and verifying it with a public key. In .NET there is RSACryptoServiceProvider implementing or wrapping all those operations. If we look at the Verify method, it is declared as this
public bool VerifyHash(byte[] rgbHash, string str, byte[] rgbSignature)

My problem is that instead of verifying I would like to decrypt the signature data into the original hash which was signed with the private key. Now, I'm a bit confused. I found many answers stating that this is impossible but is it impossible from the API standpoint or from the mathematical standpoint? I would guess that it might be not possible only from the .NET API standpoint because if I use OpenSSL and do this
.\openssl.exe rsautl -verify -certin -inkey dev.crt -in signature.dat -out original.dat

I can decrypt the signature (signature.dat) into the original value (original.dat) that signature was created from. I believe that proves that mathematically it is possible.
Now the big question is there a way to do this with .NET, any workarounds, any libraries, is there anything what will do for me what OpenSSL is capable of doing. Please don't suggest to execute OpenSSL from the code. I cannot package it with the application. I need something else, ideally finding a workaround with the existing RSACryptoServiceProvider.

What I need to do is to retrieve the original hash from the signed hash in my C#.NET code and I don't know how to do that.
","I don't believe it's possible using .NET crypto API's, at least I was not able to find a way. I was forced to re-implement the RSA algorithm using BigInteger. It's surprisingly straight forward.

Convert the signature, public exponent, and key modulus to BigIntegers.
Call BigInteger.ModPow(signature, exponent, modulus).
Convert the result to a byte[]; this is the hash you're looking for.

","Encrypt the data on the client and send the encrypted data to the server. This eliminate the need for the server to have a public key per client. Since only the client has the key a symmetric key algorithm such as AES is a better solution.

When I try to post the encrypted data to another page, to decryp, nothing happens on the decryp page.
Looks like the encrypted data posted is not valid to the private key.
What I am trying to do is to simulate a comunication between two servers with encrypted data.

","For those who are trying to make the post of the encrypted string, will not really work, because when encrypting are generated special characters, these give problem to pass in POST.
The solution I found was to convert the string to hexadecimal and decode it on the other side.

"16231795","Asymmetric encryption of text that can handle any size","we're in need to encrypt 1 column in DB / 1 attribute in hibernate entity. App will run on Tomcat, so idea is to use Tomcat's keystore, have encryption done by public key and decryption by private. There might be another source of data feed into DB, so they can also encrypt with public key, and our app is the only one which will also do decryption.
To the point - I implemented RSA encryption & decryption, it works OK. What happens is any text gets encoded into 128 byte blocks of all crazy characters. Having longer text than 117 bytes throws an exception (and I really do NOT want to split original text). Increasing encryption strength doublefold to 2048 bits increases threshold, but also size of encrpyted text so it doesn't solve the problem (i know, it's the principle of alghoritm, I should have studied more beforehand).  If I would like to pass it over app in String format, it's better to put it say in Base64. This grows to 178 bytes from few samples.
Is there any other asymetric encryption that:

would not dramatically increase size of encrypted text  
can handle blocks of text of any size

Or do I have to implement something on my own?
Thank you

Azure has a Jwks endpoint with multiple public keys, one of which its corresponding private key was used to sign my token.  My app handles signing key resolving by inspecting the keyid out of the authorization header and determining which key the token was signed with by looking it up in a cache.  
My application fetches the keys from the endpoint every 5 minutes and stores them in a cache until the next fetch occurs.  Let's say a user gets issued a token signed with Key#1. If Key#1 gets swapped out with a key#2 on the Jwks endpoint, and my app fetches Key#2 - caches it, and then attempts to verify the signature of the token signed with Key#1, then the token validation will obviously fail.  
How can I allow tokens signed with keys no longer at the Jwks endpoint to still be used to validate the token until the token's natural expire time is reached?

"30903576","Handling security when deploying Java application","I have a Java app (deployed as a JAR file) that allows file sharing through SLLSockets. If all users use the same certificate, file transfers are not secure, since it violates the core concept of asymmetric encrypted communication. Therefore, I understand that each user needs to have its own certificate. This brings up my first question:

How can you generate a certificate programmatically, and where would you store it ? I don't want users to have to generate their own certificate with keytool, then have to tell the app where it is located.

Now, let's say my first question is answered and each user has its own certificate. Prior to opening the SSL connection between two hosts, you need to add each other's certificate to the trustStore. The only way I know to achieve this is by exchanging them through Sockets (note that I am using JGroups to exchange Socket connection info). This brings up my next two questions:

How do you guarantee authentication and integrity when exchanging the certificates ?
How do you programmatically add the received certificate to the trustStore ? 

Finally, this whole post brings up my fourth question:

Are the steps described above the correct way to send data securely between two hosts, using SSLSocket asymmetric encrypted communication ?

","You don't need client certificates necessarily. 
Could you not use username/password authentication? 
You can still secure the transfer just by using a server certificate.
Client certs are also kind of a pain, and not entirely secure. They tie you to a machine, and evil processes can read them. Smart cards mitigate this, but aren't free.

"56798210","How can I decrypt text from one application in another application with asymmetric encryption?","I am trying to understand how I can decrypt a String in one application that I have encrypted in a separate application.  I can do this when I am in a single application execution, and I use the PrivateKey from the same KeyPair that generated the PublicKey.  However, I want to encrypt the value in one application, and decrypt the value in another application.  Basically I have a web service sending value I do not want to be tampered with to an application, and I was planning to use asymmetric encryption to handle it.  Feel free to let me know if I am going about solving that the wrong way.
I have tried various encryption techniques, starting with Symmetric.  The issue I ran into with that is that the value is encrypted to the same text each time - not very useful if my goal is to keep someone from tampering with a value - once they know the encrypted version of some text, they will be able to use that in any request.  I have been trying to follow the standards here - https://www.veracode.com/blog/research/encryption-and-decryption-java-cryptography
I can get all my examples working in a single transaction doing the encrypt/decrypt - it is just when I try to encrypt in one request, and decrypt in a second request that I fail.

I assume my issue is that I am re-generating a new KeyPair each time, which will only work the one time as a pair. So once I try to match a PrivateKey that came from one KeyPair to the text that was encrypted with an entirely different KeyPair, it fails.  But I have yet to find how you are supposed to otherwise achieve this in that case.

","The RSA algorithm relies on the difficulty of factoring the product of two prime numbers. 
Two large, arbitrary, prime numbers p and q are used generate each private-public key pair. Given either only the private key or the public key, it is computationally difficult to find the other key without the prime numbers p and q. However, we do not p and q in order to apply either the public or the private key to a text.

","You can't conclude that because you have a private key then you can generate the public key. Take RSA as an example - here you can't deduct one of the keys in a key pair from the other - and which one is picked as the private key, and which is picked as the public key is random.
However, when storing the keys the private key file usually includes a copy of the public key as well (or enough information to recreate it).

The phone is used to enrol multiple fingerprints, generate the Asymmetric Keys and send the public key to an online database (if possible via sms).
All the private key are destroyed or saved by the user as an mnemonic password.   
","For a GMS certified device, you won't be able to access any fingerprint-specific info on Android 6.0+. So I don't believe you can generate an asymmetric key from it as no unique information can be obtained from the TEE.
See: https://source.android.com/compatibility/7.1/android-7.1-cdd.pdf
Section: 7.3.10
Highlights:

MUST have a hardware-backed keystore implementation, and perform the
fingerprint matching in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) or on a
chip with a secure channel to the TEE.
MUST have all identifiable fingerprint data encrypted and
cryptographically authenticated such that they cannot be acquired,
read or altered outside of the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) as
documented in the implementation guidelines on the Android Open
Source Project site.
MUST NOT enable 3rd-party applications to distinguish between
individual fingerprints.

The fingerprint API seems to only be able to authenticate the fingerprint and little else: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/fingerprint/FingerprintManager.html

"57535111","Is encrypting with private key instead of signing a bad idea?","I am using a local URL scheme to submit a payload to the client when a user clicks a link and have to make sure that this is only used in my specific web application.
So I am using a key pair, encrypting the payload on the server using the private key, generating a link that the protocol handler on the client can decrypt using the public key, verifying that the payload should be processed.
So is it less secure to send a private-key-encrypted payload instead of a cleartext payload plus signature (and if yes, why)?
","What you are doing is signing! 
Encrypting is when a payload is being concealed with one’s public key and later decrypted with a private key. When I want to send you a secret message, I will take your public key (because I know it) and encrypt my message. This will make sure that only you can decrypt it with your private key. 
Signing works vice versa. If during encryption I want to make sure that only you can decrypt me message, with signing I want to make sure that all recipients of the message can be sure in its authenticity. If you encrypt something with your private (signing), anyone with your public key can decrypt it and verify its sender.
In your case, if you just want to prove your identity (like certificates, jwt tokens, etc.), you would need to use signing methods. If you want to transfer payload securely, use encryption.
Hope this helps!

I want to check if the two keys, once generated and saved, are matching.
As we know anyone has access to the public key.
ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-1/pkcs-1v2-1.pdf
For what I read, to check if a private and public key are of the same pair we verify that the Modulus is the same and that Exponent of the public key is equal to PublicExponent of the private key
If I take the public key and I do:
    <RSAKeyValue>
      <Modulus>nW/DERb839Z6fM594Eg3Y3AnpEKjMP/QzGn/iJW9snGkIl3crsa6a+g8S7uKNM0rBNoIdYnMlJTRDoPBpl35eO+ad/V0K9CJ+AqAo4q2pVEsJJujjhNX0C6wwrocS5vGWnuX02JZzVwiQxailo0qdq0qYLhp2ckQLUfwGxWr1mU=</Modulus>

    </RSAKeyValue>

As you can see, if I consider only the modulus and exponent, this private key match the public key (!).
Considering that a text is encrypted with the public key, and decrypted with the private key, is clear that no one can decrypt a message with this forged key. So, a forged key like this, is useless. 
I'm just wondering, if there is something else to do for a robust key pair match.
","@JamesKPolk Imagine a scenario where the server contains all the public keys. 
To check if the two keys are matching, the server use the public key of a user to encrypt the hash of a phrase chosen randomly
The server send the encrypted hash to the client  
The client decrypt the hash with his private key
The client send the decrypted hash to the server
If the hash is the same of the one used initially, and we repeat the proof multiple times, we have a key match. 
On client side I can also check the consistency of the private key, in the way you suggested.

"55852992","Is there a way to create a KeyPair from an NTRU AsymmetricCipherKeyPair?","I need to generate a KeyPair (java.security.KeyPair) from an NTRU AsymmetricCipherKeyPair (org.bouncycastle.crypto.AsymmetricCipherKeyPair). I use many different methods (later in the code) that have KeyPair (or PublicKey/ PrivateKey) as input and don't want to create additional methods for AsymmetricCipherKeyPair (or NTRUEncryptionPrivateKeyParameters/ NTRUEncryptionPublicKeyParameters). Is there a way to build a KeyPair from this AsymmetricCipherKeyPair?
Here some Code as an example:
NTRUEncryptionKeyPairGenerator keygen = new NTRUEncryptionKeyPairGenerator();
keygen.init(NTRUEncryptionKeyGenerationParameters.APR2011_439);
AsymmetricCipherKeyPair asymmetricCipherKeyPair = keygen.generateKeyPair();

//NTRUEncryptionPrivateKeyParameters ntruEncryptionPrivateKeyParameters = (NTRUEncryptionPrivateKeyParameters) asymmetricCipherKeyPair.getPrivate();
//NTRUEncryptionPublicKeyParameters ntruEncryptionPublicKeyParameters = (NTRUEncryptionPublicKeyParameters) asymmetricCipherKeyPair.getPublic();

KeyPair keyPair = ??? //what to do here?
PublicKey pubKey = ???
...

I seached my problem and found convert Bouncy Castle's AsymmetricCipherKeyPair (RSA) to java.security.KeyPair. But this is probably not usefull with NTRU-keys.
Thank you for your help :-)

The error occurs when I try to encrypt the content of the body (xmlsec.TypeEncContent), but it works when I try to encrypt the body element (xmlsec.TypeEncElement). Here's the code:
import dm.xmlsec.binding as xmlsec
from dm.xmlsec.binding.tmpl import EncData, fromstring

key_mngr = xmlsec.KeysMngr()
key = xmlsec.Key.load('cert.pem', xmlsec.KeyDataFormatCertPem)
key.name = 'cert.pem'
key_mngr.addKey(key)
enc_data = EncData(
    xmlsec.TransformAes128Cbc, type=xmlsec.TypeEncContent
)
enc_data.ensureCipherValue()  # target for encryption result
enc_ctx = xmlsec.EncCtx(key_mngr)
enc_ctx.encKey = xmlsec.Key.generate(
    xmlsec.KeyDataAes, 192, xmlsec.KeyDataTypeSession
)
doc = fromstring(xml_data)
body = doc.find('soap:Body', namespaces=NAMESPACES)  # NAMESPACES is redacted for brevity
encrypted_xml = enc_ctx.encryptXml(enc_data, doc.getroot())

The XML data looks something like this:
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"">
    <soap:Header>
    ...
    </soap:Header>
    <soap:Body Id=""Body"">
    ...
    </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>

What could be wrong here?
I'm not sure if this is relevant or related, but I tried to do the same using a different library https://github.com/mehcode/python-xmlsec/issues/83 and I got a Segmentation fault error, however, it worked when I tried to encrypt the element. This pattern makes me believe there's something wrong in this approach.
Any hints are appreciated. Thanks in advance!

"56137096","What is the certificate in the context of RSA and asymmetric encryption?","I try to implement a asymmetric encription for learning purpose. I learned that a certificate helps to identify the owner of a public key. But how can I implement a certificate? Can you give me an example of a certificate I can use?
I implemented the encryption and decryption, but now i want to use a certificate.
","You can generate a self signed X.509 certificate using OpenSSL - there are many tutorials online. Certificates have standardized formats and are not specific to Java.
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:3072 -sha256 -nodes -keyout privkey.pem -out selfsigned.pem
openssl pkcs8 -in privkey.pem -nocrypt -outform DER -out privkey.p8
openssl x509 -in selfsigned.pem -outform DER -out selfsigned.crt

This generates two files for the certificate (which contains the public key) and one for the private key. There is also a PEM encoded private key and certificate, which Java does not directly handle. The private key files are not encrypted or otherwise protected, so use this only for testing purposes.
The certificate is compatible with CertificateFactory for ""X.509"". The private key is compatible with KeyFactory with ""RSA"" as algorithm and PKCS8EncodedKeySpec.
Java itself cannot directly be used when it comes to generating certificates. You can use Bouncy Castle or even EJBCA if in-code generation is required, but that is quite a steep learning curve.

I learned that a certificate helps to identify the owner of a public key. But how can I implement a certificate? Can you give me an example of a certificate I can use?
I implemented the encryption and decryption, but now i want to use a certificate.
","A certificate is a piece of data that attaches certain additional information to someone's public key, and is digitally signed by a well-known third-party (authority).
The common format for certificates is X.509, encoded in ASN1.
A typical certificate would contain at least a ""common name"", the subject key fingerprint (a hash of the public key being certified), a validity period and a CA signature of all that.

"39257930","Restrict communication to server only from the right client","I am pretty confused here trying to find a solution to this problem.
There is a wifi enabled micro controller and a client (android app), both connected to the same wifi network. The official android app sends some instructions to the microcontroller through GET params.
Now i want only and only the official app to be able to send meaningful data across. To prevent man-in-the-middle attack i can encrypt this data using asymmetric keys. The micro-controller will generate the public and private keys and give out the public key through the server when asked for.
But then comes the problem. Can't the attacker send data to the device (micro-controller) too if he knows the public key? The attacker can simply get the code of the app through reverse eng. and send meaningful data through his browser to the device.
Some limitations - 

I cant make any sort of white-list on the device.
There is no internet connection. Just LAN available.
The device has no sense of time.

Some properties-

The devices have a unique 8 digit id. In scenario of multiple devices, the right one is targeted using this id. The devices' used IP address is mapped to this ID.
The android app (client) sends numeric strings in GET params for the devices to perform operations.

Can this be solved using a fool-proof method?
Thank you in advance.

"26613683","Should I be using asymmetric key?","I want to keep sensitive information online on github but I am struggling with how to implement this. 
Currently I have symmetric encryption with a very long key ( 4K characters ). but someone told me it is not safe enough and that I should be using travis' mechanism of asymmetric encryption. 
Can someone please explain 

Is it really less safe than travis' method? The way I see it both methods use a secret string to decrypt. 
I am currently using openssl for this procedure - is this the right tool for this task?

Adding more info to answer comments
travis' mechanism - described here: http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/
do other people need to access it? - yes. the procedure to decrypt should be known in the company, and other employees should be able to decrypt it. However people outside of the company should not be able to decrypt it. 
What am I encrypting with it? - hopefully every sensitive information the company has that is required for testing or mocking the system. We have tests on many clouds (ec2, azure, hpcloud and more..) , I would like to keep their account credentials. I would like to keep smtp credentials. credentials to services our code uses like mailchimp/mandrill. 
I would also like to encrypt our SSL certificate for the domains that we own. 
So basically, if someone will ever decrypt this file, they can potentially damage the company in many ways.

I Used code found at the site ""http://gas.dia.unisa.it/projects/jpbc/schemes/ss_bls01.html"" as reference.
The result is the following java source code:

boolean result = verifier.verifySignature(signature);

//
System.out.println(""Signature len = "" + signature.length);      
System.out.println(""Result = "" + result);

Up to here everything worked correctly, at least I think.
The next step I want to acieve is storing and retrieving public and private keys using files. 
I found that it's possible to get private and public keys as byte arrays using code as:
...
byte[] PublicKeyBytes = ((BLS01PublicKeyParameters)(keyPair.getPublic())).getPk().toBytes()
...

But how can I do the reverse process to set public and private keys starting from bytes? 
Is this the correct way to store/retrieve keys in/from files?

Also I generated create scripts of complete database using SSMS. But create scripts of asymmetric keys are not generated. I want to know that if I create asymmetric key with the password given by the project owner, will old data still be validated from it? I mean does asymmetric key is system independent?
","First, I would recommend getting an overview on column level encryption through a book, video, technical session during a SQL Saturday or other means. Even though I am going to provide the solution, you need a solid understanding of how the encryption system works so that you will understand how to avoid losing encrypted data by making a mistake. That said, the solution is to backup the database, then backup the Database Master Key providing a password to encrypt the key in the file specified. Migrate the files to the destination server then restore the database and restore the Database Master Key using the password previously provided. This will complete the encryption hierarchy. Since all database keys, including asymmetric and symmetric keys, are backed up with the database, they will be transferred to the destination server in the backup file.

"37076723","How to make sure that only the authorized user can access a feature provided by the server?","We are building an android application and one of its features is to book a cab service provider's cab (say an Uber).
We have an application specific user ID. Let us call it AUID. To book the cab, the application would Post a request to server and send AUID along with other relevant information (like lat, long etc). How do I make sure at the server end that the request is indeed coming from the correct user and it is safe to book the cab? In the current form, if a third party gets to know the AUID of another person, the third party can book a cab on behalf of that person. 
One of the solutions I thought of was using asymmetric encryption. The application would hold the public key and the server would contain the private key. Instead of sending the user ID to the server, we'll instead send an encrypted key where the key would be AUID + timestamp encrypted using the public key. We'll then decrypt the message using private key at server end to obtain the AUID. If the timestamp at server does not lie within a certain interval of the timstamp sent by the client, we reject the request.
Is this a safe enough approach? Is there any other practice widely followed for such scenarios?
","What you propose is sensible: encrypt the AUID on the client app and verify on the server. As comments suggest, SSL is vital.
The problem is that if how to encrypt the AUID is in your app, it can be figured out by anyone dedicated enough.
You can drastically reduce the risks of fake requests by issuing a separate encryption key for each user.  This means that if someone cracks your code, they can still only spoof from one account.  However, once an attacker had decompiled your app, they could theoretically start new accounts, get a valid encryption key and spoof requests.
What you need for 100% reliability is some form of authentication which is not stored in the client app - like a password or TouchID on iOS or fingerprint api on Android M. So when a user orders a cab, they need to enter some piece of information which you also encode with the AUID and check on the server. That secret information is not stored in your app, so no-one can fake requests.
Requiring a password from a user is pretty inconvenient.  Fingerprint scanning is much easier and probably acceptable. You could also use a trust system - if the user has ordered cabs before and everything was OK, they can order without special authentication. Using Trust together with individual encryption keys is pretty effective because anyone trying to spoof requests would need to do a successful order before being able to spoof - which is probably too much hassle for them.

"47169390","Storing public key locally on android device","I want to use A-symmetric encryption for my application.
The application basically takes a photo and sends it to a server, I haven't written any code yet and am just going through this as a POC.
I came across a problem that I solved before but now it's puzzling me again.
Like I said I want to use Asymmetric encryption where the private key is located on my server, and the public key is stored locally and 'shipped' with each android app (I.E. including in its resources). I want to use the public key along with a ByteOutputStream or EncryptedOutputStream and send the information already encrypted to the server for decryption on site.
My question is basically how safe is the process of encrypting the data i'm sending out to the server? Obviously I understand that there is no such thing as completely safe, but is this a good practice, is there something that's sort of an industry-standard? 
","Copypaste from this answer regarding asymmetric cryptography.
The currently largest broken RSA key is a 768-bit modulus, and it took some huge effort (four years, and really big brains). 1024-bit keys are considered usable for short term security, although larger keys are encouraged. 2048-bit keys are appropriate. Using a key twice larger means 8 times more work for signing or decryption, so you do not want to overdo it. See this site for a survey of how RSA key length can be related to security.
ECDSA over a 256-bit curve already achieves an ""unbreakable"" level of security (i.e. roughly the same level than AES with a 128-bit key, or SHA-256 against collisions). Note that there are elliptic curves on prime fields, and curves on binary fields; which kind is most efficient depends on the involved hardware (for curves of similar size, a PC will prefer the curves on a prime field, but dedicated hardware will be easier to build with binary fields; the CLMUL instructions on the newer Intel and AMD processors may change that).

"58571622","How to accomplish assymetric encryption with Netty without SSL","I have been trying for a while to do encryption in a netty chat program I created. I have been trying to add encryption WITHOUT a certificate or SSL by encrypting the messages themselves. I have tried AES encryption and it did ""succeed"" but the password to decrypt the messages was plain text so it didn't do anything. I have also tried RSA encryption but I can't get it to encrypt a JSON string message
I used the RSA encryption transformation: ""RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding""
public static String encrypt(String plainText, PublicKey publicKey) throws BadPaddingException, IllegalBlockSizeException, InvalidKeyException, NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException {

        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(StaticHandler.RSA_CIPHER_TRANSFORMATION);
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, publicKey);
        return new String(cipher.doFinal(plainText.getBytes()), CharsetUtil.UTF_8);
    }

How it works currently:
The server generates a key pair only used in the initial handshake, then sends the public key to the client. Then the client generates a new key pair encrypted with the public key the server sent. Once the server receives the new key pair, it uses that instead of the one created in the initial handshake so the client can decrypt messages sent by the server.
But I can't seem to get it to work with sending a JSON string with the part of the connection handshake where the client generates a new keypair that the server will use to send encrypted messages back to the client.
I'm not necessarily asking for spoon feeding code but an explanation of how this can be handled better or an encryption protocol that is better suited for my means, though it is helpful to see code examples :p

The loophole is if some unauthorized person comes to know my public key , then he could make a malicious WebService call. How can I prevent this?
","The public key in an asymmetric algorithm is expected to be exactly that - public and therefore expected to be known by everyone. If you are trying to implement authentication by only distributing the public key to ""authorized"" users then your mechanism is fundamentally flawed.
A more usual way to do this would be to have your clients each generate their own asymmetric key-pair and provide you with the public key, whilst keeping the private key secure. The clients can then authenticate themselves by signing a message with their private key, which you would validate with their public key.
This being said I would strongly suggest using something like TLS with client certificate authentication to implement secrecy, integrity and authentication at the transport level rather than attempting to roll your own cryptosystem at the application level. It's likely to be far more secure than anything you'd implement yourself as well as being far easier for your clients to implement.

","To answer your question about what happens to the string during the process - the string is decoded into bits, then the bits are encrypted.  
Most modern encryption protocols ultimately use AES symmetric encryption to encrypt the message, using a secret key shared by both the sender of the message and the recipient.  The message is broken up into blocks of 128 bits (and usually padded), then the AES algorithm is used to encrypt these bits.

","If the goal is that you want to ensure the value in the property file has not been modified (by the end user or anyone else), you can use a private key to sign the value.

In the app distributed to the user, use the public key to verify that the signed value was signed with the private key. If the value was modified, the verification of the signature with the public key will fail, so you know the value has been changed.

The signing key must be stored on server, and it creates a very valuable attack vector.
The potential attacker who obtains access to the private key can generate a JWT with any set of claims, impersonating any user, and can potentially extract all their data - without knowing the password.
How to use JWT for (stateless) authentication while eliminating the risk of an attacker using a stolen private key to impersonate any user without knowing their password?
","This question should be moved to https://security.stackexchange.com . Lots of similar questions there with good answers.
You're making a number of assumptions when going from ""the signing key must be"" available to ""available"" means it's ""stored on the server"" to ""attacker can who obtains access to the key"". Sure, if you store the private key in a plaintext file on a filesystem with public read, that's one threat model. If you have the key in, say, a HSM that's a whole different animal.
Broad answer: there are a number of key management best practices. For example, OWASP cheatsheet has some recommendations:


Developers must understand where cryptographic keys are stored within
  the application. Understand what memory devices the keys are stored
  on. 
Keys must be protected on both volatile and persistent memory,
  ideally processed within secure cryptographic modules. 
Keys should
  never be stored in plaintext format. 
Ensure all keys are stored in
  cryptographic vault, such as a hardware security module (HSM) or
  isolated cryptographic service.


...and so on. 
You can also prepare for a worst-case scenario of your key being stolen by considering a more benign use case of rotating the keys.

If both are not same then an error will be thrown. Is this possible ?

"57358534","Exposing PublicKeysetHandle","I am using, or trying to use, the Google Tink libraries. I want to be able to sign a data block with my private key, and then send that to the server. The server needs to validate the data block signature on receipt. In the use case that will be many senders, and hence many public keys. 
My problem is that Google Tink does not expose the PublicKeysetHandle and won't serialize it. This means the when setting up an account, the sender can't transmit the public key. 
The only ways I have found are to either write the public key to a file, read the file as JSON, and send JSON, and then delete the file. OK, so this only has to happen at account configuration, but it seems a messy way to do it. 
Otherwise, I have to put the key in to a key management system. 
Anyone resolved this?

I need to know how to generate public and private keys using C programming. I am working on Keil. Are there any drivers available for this? I need to implement it using I2C interfacing.
Thank you

It's 96 bytes long with the first four bytes being
61

53

86

213

And this is the function to turn it back to an Array Buffer.
thing = thing.replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/');
// base64 to Uint8Array
var str = window.atob(thing);
var bytes = new Uint8Array(str.length);
for (var i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    bytes[i] = str.charCodeAt(i);
}
thing = bytes;

Does anyone know a good way to determine what method of encryption was used to form the key.
It comes from a U2F Fido... thingy
