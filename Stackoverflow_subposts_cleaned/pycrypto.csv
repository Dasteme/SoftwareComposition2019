"12524994","Encrypt & Decrypt using PyCrypto AES 256","I'm trying to build two functions using PyCrypto that accept two parameters: the message and the key, and then encrypt/decrypt the message.
I found several links on the web to help me out, but each one of them has flaws:
This one at codekoala uses os.urandom, which is discouraged by PyCrypto.
Moreover, the key I give to the function is not guaranteed to have the exact length expected. What can I do to make that happen ?
Also, there are several modes, which one is recommended? I don't know what to use :/
Finally, what exactly is the IV? Can I provide a different IV for encrypting and decrypting, or will this return in a different result?
Here's what I've done so far:
from Crypto import Random
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import base64

BLOCK_SIZE=32

def encrypt(message, passphrase):
    # passphrase MUST be 16, 24 or 32 bytes long, how can I do that ?
    IV = Random.new().read(BLOCK_SIZE)
    aes = AES.new(passphrase, AES.MODE_CFB, IV)
    return base64.b64encode(aes.encrypt(message))

def decrypt(encrypted, passphrase):
    IV = Random.new().read(BLOCK_SIZE)
    aes = AES.new(passphrase, AES.MODE_CFB, IV)
    return aes.decrypt(base64.b64decode(encrypted))

","You can get a passphrase out of an arbitrary password by using a cryptographic hash function (NOT Python's builtin hash) like SHA-1 or SHA-256. Python includes support for both in its standard library:
import hashlib

hashlib.sha1(""this is my awesome password"").digest() # => a 20 byte string
hashlib.sha256(""another awesome password"").digest() # => a 32 byte string

You can truncate a cryptographic hash value just by using [:16] or [:24] and it will retain its security up to the length you specify.

","You may need the following two functions to pad(when do encryption) and unpad(when do decryption) when the length of input is not a multiple of BLOCK_SIZE.
BS = 16
pad = lambda s: s + (BS - len(s) % BS) * chr(BS - len(s) % BS) 
unpad = lambda s : s[:-ord(s[len(s)-1:])]

So you're asking the length of key? You can use the md5sum of the key rather than use it directly.
More, according to my little experience of using PyCrypto, the IV is used to mix up the output of a encryption when input is same, so the IV is chosen as a random string, and use it as part of the encryption output, and then use it to decrypt the message.
And here's my implementation, hope it will be useful for you:

","Let me address your question about ""modes."" AES256 is a kind of block cipher. It takes as input a 32-byte key and a 16-byte string, called the block and outputs a block. We use AES in a mode of operation in order to encrypt. The solutions above suggest using CBC, which is one example. Another is called CTR, and it's somewhat easier to use:
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util import Counter
from Crypto import Random

# AES supports multiple key sizes: 16 (AES128), 24 (AES192), or 32 (AES256).
key_bytes = 32

# Takes as input a 32-byte key and an arbitrary-length plaintext and returns a
# pair (iv, ciphtertext). ""iv"" stands for initialization vector.
def encrypt(key, plaintext):
    assert len(key) == key_bytes

    # Choose a random, 16-byte IV.
    iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)

    # Convert the IV to a Python integer.
    iv_int = int(binascii.hexlify(iv), 16) 

    # Create a new Counter object with IV = iv_int.

# Takes as input a 32-byte key, a 16-byte IV, and a ciphertext, and outputs the

def decrypt(key, iv, ciphertext):
    assert len(key) == key_bytes

    # Initialize counter for decryption. iv should be the same as the output of
    # encrypt().
    iv_int = int(iv.encode('hex'), 16) 
    ctr = Counter.new(AES.block_size * 8, initial_value=iv_int)

This is often referred to as AES-CTR. I would advise caution in using AES-CBC with PyCrypto. The reason is that it requires you to specify the padding scheme, as exemplified by the other solutions given. In general, if you're not very careful about the padding, there are attacks that completely break encryption! 
Now, it's important to note that the key must be a random, 32-byte string; a password does not suffice. Normally, the key is generated like so:
# Nominal way to generate a fresh key. This calls the system's random number
# generator (RNG).
key1 = Random.new().read(key_bytes)

A key may be derived from a password, too:
# It's also possible to derive a key from a password, but it's important that
# the password have high entropy, meaning difficult to predict.
password = ""This is a rather weak password.""

# For added # security, we add a ""salt"", which increases the entropy.
#
# In this example, we use the same RNG to produce the salt that we used to
# produce key1.
salt_bytes = 8 
salt = Random.new().read(salt_bytes)

# Stands for ""Password-based key derivation function 2""
key2 = PBKDF2(password, salt, key_bytes)

Some solutions above suggest using SHA256 for deriving the key, but this is generally considered bad cryptographic practice.

","WARNING: Don't use pycrypto anymore!
As you can read on this page, the usage of pycrypto is not safe anymore:

Pycrypto is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the ALGnew function in block_templace.c. It allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the python application. It was assigned the CVE-2013-7459 number.
Pycrypto didn’t release any fix to that vulnerability and no commit was made to the project since Jun 20, 2014.

SOLUTION: Use Python3 and pycryptodome!
TL;DR: pip3 install pycryptodome
Setting up a new virtual environment
To install a virtual environment and setup everything, use the following commands:
# install python3 and pip3
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip

# install and create a virtual environment
# cd to or mkdir the folder where you want your venv
pip3 install virtualenv
python3 -m virtualenv .

# now activate your venv and install pycryptodome
source bin/activate
pip3 install pycryptodome

# check if everything worked: 
# start the interactive python console and import the Crypto module
# when there is no import error then it worked
python
>>> from Crypto.Cipher import AES
>>> exit()

# don't forget to deactivate your venv again
deactivate

","In general
vcvarsall.bat is part of the Visual C++ compiler, you need that to install what you are trying to install. Don't even try to deal with MingGW if your Python was compiled with Visual Studio toolchain and vice versa. Even the version of the Microsoft tool chain is important. Python compiled with VS 2008 won't work with extensions compiled with VS 2010!
You have to compile PyCrypto with the same compiler that the version of Python was compiled with. Google for ""Unable to find vcvarsall.bat"" because that is the root of your problem, it is a very common problem with compiling Python extensions on Windows.
There is a lot of information and a lot to read to get this right on whatever system you are on with this link. 
Beware using Visual Studio 2010 or not using Visual Studio 2008
As far as I know the following is still true. This was posted in the link above in June, 2010 referring to trying to build extensions with VS 2010 Express against the Python installers available on python.org.

Be careful if you do this. Python 2.6 and 2.7 from python.org are
  built with Visual Studio 2008 compilers. You will need to link with
  the same CRT (msvcr90.dll) as Python.
Visual Studio 2010 Express links with the wrong CRT version:
  msvcr100.dll.
If you do this, you must also re-build Python with Visual Studio 2010
  Express. You cannot use the standard Python binary installer for
  Windows. Nor can you use any C/C++ extensions built with a different
  compiler than Visual Studio 2010 (Express).

Opinion: This is one reason I abandoned Windows for all serious development work for OSX!

","It's possible to build PyCrypto using the Windows 7 SDK toolkits. There are two versions of the Windows 7 SDK. The original version (for .Net 3.5) includes the VS 2008 command-line compilers. Both 32- and 64-bit compilers can be installed.
The first step is to compile mpir to provide fast arithmetic. I've documented the process I use in the gmpy library. Detailed instructions for building mpir using the SDK compiler can be found at sdk_build
The key steps to use the SDK compilers from a DOS prompt are:
1) Run either vcvars32.bat or vcvars64.bat as appropriate.
2) At the prompt, execute ""set MSSdk=1""
3) At the prompt, execute ""set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1""
This should allow ""python setup.py install"" to succeed assuming there are no other issues  with the C code. But I vaaguely remember that I had to edit a couple of PyCrypto files to enable mpir and to find the mpir libraries but I don't have my Windows system up at the moment. It will be a couple of days before I'll have time to recreate the steps. If you haven't reported success by then, I'll post the PyCrypto steps. The steps will assume you were able to compile mpir.
I hope this helps.

","I have managed to get pycrypto to compile by using MinGW32 and MSYS. This presumes that you have pip or easy_install installed.
Here's how I did it:
1) Install MinGW32. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume it's installed in C:\MinGW. When using the installer, which I recommend, select the C++ compiler.  MSYS should install with MinGW
2) Add c:\mingw\bin,c:\mingw\mingw32\bin,C:\MinGW\msys\1.0, c:\mingw\msys\1.0\bin and c:\mingw\msys\1.0\sbin to your %PATH%. If you aren't familiar, this article is very helpful.
3) From the search bar, run msys and the MSYS terminal will open. For those familiar with Cygwin, it works in a similar fashion.
4) From within the MSYS terminal pip install pycrypto should run without error after this.

This error ""RuntimeError: chmod error"" occurs because the install script didn't find the chmod command.

Solution
You only need to add the MSYS binaries to the PATH and re-run the install script.
(N.B: Note that MinGW comes with MSYS so )
Example
For example, if we are in folder C:\<..>\pycrypto-2.6.1\dist\pycrypto-2.6.1>
C:\.....>set PATH=C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin;%PATH%
C:\.....>python setup.py install
Optional: you might need to clean before you re-run the script:
`C:\<..>\pycrypto-2.6.1\dist\pycrypto-2.6.1> python setup.py clean`

You can use following command to do so: msiexec /i C:\users\jozko\download\VCForPython27.msi ALLUSERS=1 just use your own path to file: msiexec /i <path to MSI> ALLUSERS=1
Now you should be able to install pycrypto with: pip install pycrypto

"," Step 1: Install Visual C++ 2010 Express from

(Do not install Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1 ) 
Step 2: Remove all the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable packages from Control Panel\Programs and Features. If you don't do those then the install is going to fail with an obscure ""Fatal error during installation"" error.
Step 3: Install offline version of Windows SDK for Visual Studio 2010 (v7.1) from here.
This is required for 64bit extensions. Windows has builtin mounting for ISOs like Pismo. 
Step 4: You need to install the ISO file with Pismo File Mount Audit Package. Download Pismo from here 
Step 5: Right click the downloaded ISO file and choose mount with Pismo. Thereafter, install the Setup\SDKSetup.exe instead of setup.exe.
Step 6a: Create a vcvars64.bat file in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin\amd64 by changing directory to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio version\VC\ on the command prompt.
Type command on the command prompt:
cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio version\VC\r 
Step 6b:
To configure this Command Prompt window for 64-bit command-line builds that target x86 platforms, at the command prompt, enter:

openssl aes-256-cbc -salt -in filename -out filename.enc

Python has support for AES in the shape of the PyCrypto package, but it only provides the tools. How to use Python/PyCrypto to decrypt files that have been encrypted using OpenSSL?
Notice
This question used to also concern encryption in Python using the same scheme. I have since removed that part to discourage anyone from using it. Do NOT encrypt any more data in this way, because it is NOT secure by today's standards. You should ONLY use decryption, for no other reasons than BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY, i.e. when you have no other choice. Want to encrypt? Use NaCl/libsodium if you possibly can.
","Given the popularity of Python, at first I was disappointed that there was no complete answer to this question to be found. It took me a fair amount of reading different answers on this board, as well as other resources, to get it right. I thought I might share the result for future reference and perhaps review; I'm by no means a cryptography expert! However, the code below appears to work seamlessly:
from hashlib import md5
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto import Random

def derive_key_and_iv(password, salt, key_length, iv_length):
    d = d_i = ''
    while len(d) < key_length + iv_length:
        d_i = md5(d_i + password + salt).digest()
        d += d_i
    return d[:key_length], d[key_length:key_length+iv_length]

def decrypt(in_file, out_file, password, key_length=32):
    bs = AES.block_size
    salt = in_file.read(bs)[len('Salted__'):]
    key, iv = derive_key_and_iv(password, salt, key_length, bs)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    next_chunk = ''
    finished = False
    while not finished:
        chunk, next_chunk = next_chunk, cipher.decrypt(in_file.read(1024 * bs))
        if len(next_chunk) == 0:
            padding_length = ord(chunk[-1])
            chunk = chunk[:-padding_length]
            finished = True
        out_file.write(chunk)

Usage:
with open(in_filename, 'rb') as in_file, open(out_filename, 'wb') as out_file:
    decrypt(in_file, out_file, password)

","I know this is a bit late but here is a solution that I blogged in 2013 about how to use the python pycrypto package to encrypt/decrypt in an openssl compatible way. It has been tested on python2.7 and python3.x. The source code and a test script can be found here.
One of the key differences between this solution and the excellent solutions presented above is that it differentiates between pipe and file I/O which can cause problems in some applications.

","Note: this method is not OpenSSL compatible
But it is suitable if all you want to do is encrypt and decrypt files.
A self-answer I copied from here. I think this is, perhaps, a simpler and more secure option. Although I would be interested in some expert opinion on how secure it is.
I used Python 3.6 and SimpleCrypt to encrypt the file and then uploaded it. 
I think this is the code I used to encrypt the file:
from simplecrypt import encrypt, decrypt
f = open('file.csv','r').read()
ciphertext = encrypt('USERPASSWORD',f.encode('utf8')) # I am not certain of whether I used the .encode('utf8')
e = open('file.enc','wb') # file.enc doesn't need to exist, python will create it
e.write(ciphertext)
e.close

This is the code I use to decrypt at runtime, I run getpass(""password: "") as an argument so I don't have to store a password variable in memory
from simplecrypt import encrypt, decrypt
from getpass import getpass

# opens the file
f = open('file.enc','rb').read()

print('Please enter the password and press the enter key \n Decryption may take some time')

# Decrypts the data, requires a user-input password
plaintext = decrypt(getpass(""password: ""), f).decode('utf8')
print('Data have been Decrypted')

Note, the UTF-8 encoding behaviour is different in python 2.7 so the code will be slightly different.

For the first sequence you need to install 'ecdsa' with pip because paramiko compilation does not automatically resolve its dependencies (as your working solution)
The second failed, as stated already, because you did not install pycrypto before running pip install paramiko. I would recommend to use this option rather than installing from source to enable easier upgrade path using pip. Also pip is the easiest to install using their standalone install script: http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html

","For installing paramiko, Visual Basic Compiler is needed.
First download it from Microcsoft: Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7
Open the paramiko directory and run     python setup.py install    . And it will download dependencies from internet; especially pycrypto and installation will be successful.

error: command 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\BIN\cl.exe' failed with exit status 2
missed this file: 'openssl/opensslv.h'
it will be happens because while installation paramiko/cryptography/pyOpenSSL packages, they all needed distribution package of OpenSSL-Win32 with *.lib and headers files like: openssl\opensslv.h
so, after installation appropriate OpenSSL app. version, took from here: 
http://code.x2go.org/releases/binary-win32/3rd-party/Win32OpenSSL/
and copied all headers from C:\OpenSSL-Win32\include\openssl*.* to C:\Pyhton27\inclide*.*
and copied all libs from C:\OpenSSL-win32\lib to C:\Python27\Lib*.*
paramiko package was installed successfully. !

","You need to install Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 to install pycrypto:
error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required. Get it with ""Microsoft Visual
C++ Build Tools"": http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools

In the comments you ask which link to use. Use the link to Visual C++ 2015 Build Tools. That will install Visual C++ 14.0 without installing Visual Studio.
In the comments you ask about methods of installing pycrypto that do not require installing a compiler. The binaries in the links appear to be for earlier versions of Python than you are using. One link is to a binary in a DropBox account.
I do not recommend downloading binary versions of cryptography libraries provided by third parties. The only way to guarantee that you are getting a version of pycrypto that is compatible with your version of Python and has not been built with any backdoors is to build it from the source.
After you have installed Visual C++, just re-run the original command:
pip install -U steem

To find out what the various install options mean, run this command:
pip help install

The help for the -U option says
-U, --upgrade        Upgrade all specified packages to the newest available
                     version. The handling of dependencies depends on the
                     upgrade-strategy used.

If you do not already have the steem library installed, you can run the command without the -U option.

"44951456","Pip error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required","I just ran the ""pip install -U steem""-command and the installation worked well until it failed to install pycrypto. 
Afterwards I did the ""pip install cryptography"" command because I thought it was the missing package. 
So my question is, how I can install steem without the pycrypto-error (or the pycrypto-package in addition) and how to deinstall the cryptography-Package which I don't need.

","I got this error when I tried to install pymssql even though Visual C++ 2015 (14.0) is installed in my system.
I resolved this error by downloading the .whl file of pymssql from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
Once downloaded, it can be installed by the following command :
pip install python_package.whl

Hope this helps

"44951456","Pip error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required","I just ran the ""pip install -U steem""-command and the installation worked well until it failed to install pycrypto. 
Afterwards I did the ""pip install cryptography"" command because I thought it was the missing package. 
So my question is, how I can install steem without the pycrypto-error (or the pycrypto-package in addition) and how to deinstall the cryptography-Package which I don't need.

","On Windows, I strongly recommand installing latest Visual Stuido Community, it's free, you will maybe miss some build tools if you only install vc_redist, so you can easily install package by pip instead of wheel, it save lot of time

","If you already have Visual Studio Build Tools installed but you're still getting that error, then you may need to ""Modify"" your installation to include the Visual C++ build tools.
To do that:

Open up the Visual Studio Installer (you can search for it in the Start Menu if needed).
Find Visual Studio Build Tools and click ""Modify"":



Add a checkmark to Visual C++ build tools and then click ""Modify"" in the bottom right to install them:


After the C++ tools finish installing, run the pip command again and it should work.

","I faced the same problem. Found the fix here.
https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/issues/4160
Basically just install
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691126&fixForIE=.exe
shasum output:
3e0de8af516c15547602977db939d8c2e44fcc0b  visualcppbuildtools_full.exe
md5sum output:
MD5 (visualcppbuildtools_full.exe) = 8d4afd3b226babecaa4effb10d69eb2e
Run your pip installation command again. If everything works fine, its good. Or you might face the following error like me:
Finished generating code
    LINK : fatal error LNK1158: cannot run 'rc.exe'
    error: command 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\\VC\\BIN\\x86_amd64\\link.exe' failed with exit status 1158

Found the fix for the above problem here:
Visual Studio can't build due to rc.exe
That basically says
Add this to your PATH environment variables:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\bin\x86

Copy these files:

rc.exe
rcdll.dll

From

C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\bin\x86

To

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\VC\bin

It works like a charm

Afterwards I did the ""pip install cryptography"" command because I thought it was the missing package. 
So my question is, how I can install steem without the pycrypto-error (or the pycrypto-package in addition) and how to deinstall the cryptography-Package which I don't need.

","Pycrypto has vulnerabilities assigned the CVE-2013-7459 number, and the repo hasn't accept PRs since June 23, 2014.
Pycryptodome is a drop-in replacement for the PyCrypto library, which exposes almost the same API as the old PyCrypto, see  Compatibility with PyCrypto.
If you haven't install pycrypto yet, you can use pip install pycryptodome to install pycryptodome in which you won't get Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 issue.

","That warning shouldn't stop the build, more likely you are lacking the Visual Studio 2015 compiler which is necessary to build binary extensions (which PyCrypto has). See the Python Packaging User Guide for which compiler you need for your version of Python.
The reason you need the compiler is PyCrypto only offers a Source Distribution officially. So, you have two options for installing PyCrypto:
1. Build from source:
This is actually fairly simple, but it requires that you install some extra software. Again, refer to the Python Packaging User Guide linked above to find the suitable compiler for your version of Python. I think that there is an option to only install the relevant compiler for Python if you do a custom install of Visual Studio.
Then, after the installation is completed, and you probably had to restart your computer, you should be able to simply run pip install pycrypto and pip will download the source and compile it for you.
If you also installed wheel (pip install wheel) then pip will create a wheel from the source and cache it, which is how I created the wheels that I'm sharing in option 2.
2. Install a Built Distribution from a 3rd party
I happen to be a 3rd party and have shared wheels I compiled for PyCrypto 2.6.1 w/ Python 3.5 for 32 and 64-bit Windows on my GitHub repo. I included installation instructions on the readme of that repo.
If you're looking for a built distribution for an older version of Python and/or PyCrypto, I've also linked to Voidspace on my repo's readme (sorry, I'm limited to 2 links here).

","Use this post as a reference to do this procedure over Windows systems:
http://codeyarns.com/2012/04/28/python-version-not-found-in-registry-error/
Using that, we can do this:

Using the Windows Run dialog, open the regedit program.
Export from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python (python_install_35.reg). Go to this location and execute ""export"" in the context menu.
Edit the reg file and replace HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE with HKEY_CURRENT_USER
Execute a console (cmd) prompt as admin and execute 
regedit python_install_35.reg
Add the entries to the registry
See the modified entries with regedit and change HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore\3.5 to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore\3.3. 
Re-run the installer

Follow this instructions.
Long version:
Install VC++ 2008 SP1 Express. you can get it from here.
You also need the Windows SDK, specifically the Win7 + Net 3.5 SDK.
Maybe the issue was already solved in your python version, if not get the diff file from the issue page
download patch.py (or any other tool to patch diff files)
if you downloaded the patch.py and diff file in c:\Python27 just run:
python patch-11.01.py vcvars3.diff

Finally install using pip:
pip install pycrypto

","AES.new().encrypt() and .decrypt() take as both input and output strings whose length is a multiple of 16.  You have to fix it in one way or another.  For example you can store the real length at the start, and use that to truncate the decrypted string.
Note also that while it's the only restriction for AES, other modules (notably in Crypto.PublicKey) have additional restrictions that comes from their mathematical implementation and that shouldn't (in my opinion) be visible to the end user, but are.  For example Crypto.PublicKey.ElGamal will encrypt any short string, but if it starts with null characters, they are lost upon decryption.

","To be honest, the characters ""\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"" don't look that random to me. ;-)
You are using AES in CBC mode. That requires length of plaintext and ciphertext to be always a multiple of 16 bytes. With the code you show, you should actually see an exception being raised when data passed to encrypt() does not fulfill such condition. It looks like you added enough new line characters ('\n' to whatever the input is until the plaintext happened to be aligned.
Apart from that, there are two common ways to solve the alignment issue:

Switch from CBC (AES.MODE_CBC) to CFB (AES.MODE_CFB). With the default segment_size used by PyCrypto, you will not have any restriction on plaintext and ciphertext lengths.
Keep CBC and use a padding scheme like PKCS#7, that is:

before encrypting a plaintext of X bytes, append to the back as many bytes you need to to reach the next 16 byte boundary. All padding bytes have the same value: the number of bytes that you are adding:
length = 16 - (len(data) % 16)
data += bytes([length])*length

That's Python 3 style. In Python 2, you would have:
length = 16 - (len(data) % 16)
data += chr(length)*length

after decrypting, remove from the back of the plaintext as many bytes as indicated by padding:
data = data[:-data[-1]]



Even though I understand in your case it is just a class exercise, I would like to point out that it is insecure to send data without any form of authentication (e.g. a MAC).

","According to the documentation at:
https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.PublicKey.RSA._RSAobj-class.html
you should not use Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.sign function from PyCrypto in real code:

Attention: this function performs the plain, primitive RSA decryption (textbook). In real applications, you always need to use proper cryptographic padding, and you should not directly sign data with this method. Failure to do so may lead to security vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use modules Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_PSS or Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_v1_5 instead.

I ended up using the RSA module that implements PKCS1_v1_5. The documentation for signing was pretty straight forward. Others have recommended use M2Crypto.

","In Python 3 (which you are clearly using) the default mode for files you open is text, not binary. When you read from the file, you get strings rather than byte arrays. That does not go along with encryption.
In your code, you should replace:
open(file_name, 'r')

with:
open(file_name, 'rb')

The same for when you open the file for writing. At that point, you can get rid of all the various occurrences where you convert from string to binary and vice versa.
For instance, this can go away:
plaintext = plaintext.encode('utf-8')

","I took a closer look at your code, and saw that there were several problems with it. First one is that the crypto functions with with bytes, not text. So it's better to just keep the data as a byte string. This is done simply by putting a 'b' character in the mode.

In my case, I want to ensure authenticity so I encrypt the data with the private key and allow anyone to decrypt it with the public key. The data is not really secret but I need to guarantee that it was created by the owner of the public (and private) key.
When I try to decrypt using PyCrypto I get No private key error from PyCrypto. The code is this:

I'm calling it with the path to the public key file (in OpenSSH format.) The encrypted data isn't generated by me and it was not done with Python but PHP. In PHP there's a openssl_public_decrypt function that decrypts this data easily.

","That is totally insecure, because you are using raw RSA without padding.
Your application needs a signature, so you should not be dealing with encryptions and decryptions. For instance, PKCS#1 v1.5 is a good protocol, even though the signature is a piece of data that must be appended to what you want to prove the authenticity of.
To verify a PKCS#1 v1.5 signature in Python, you do:
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Signature import PKCS1_v1_5
from Crypto.Hash import SHA

rsa_key = RSA.importKey(open(verification_key_file, ""rb"").read())
verifier = PKCS1_v1_5.new(rsa_key)
h = SHA.new(data_to_verify)
if verifier.verify(h, signature_received_with_the_data):
    print ""OK""
else:
    print ""Invalid""

I would strongly recommend to change the PHP code so that it creates such a signature.

If you don't want or cannot use openssl, you can take the PEM X.509 certificate and do it in pure Python like this:

What's wrong?
Is it possible to generate an encrypted RSA key, store it in a file and later use it with PyCrypto? Is it possible to do it with OpenSSL? What formats are supported?
Importing the public key works fine, however it is not encrypted.
","Hypothesis #1
After looking to the source code, I think, I solved the mystery. The way how import works for PEM keys encrypted with a password is that the PEM gets decrypted to DER and after that importKeyDER function is called. If provided password is not correct, the format of generated DER representation will not be correct too and you would get an exception that you've provided. To confirm that, I ran two quick tests below:
>>> from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
>>> f = open('<some-path>/private-key.pem','r')
>>> r=RSA.importKey(f.read(),passphrase='foo')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Crypto/PublicKey/RSA.py"", line 665, in importKey

    raise ValueError(""RSA key format is not supported"")
ValueError: RSA key format is not supported
>>> f = open('<some-path>/private-key.pem','r')
>>> r=RSA.importKey(f.read(),passphrase='<valid-pass-phrase>')
>>> r
<_RSAobj @0xb7237b2c n(4096),e,d,p,q,u,private>

After receiving the PEM from the author, I've realized that Hypothesis #1 is not valid for his case. I still want to keep it here as one possible reason of import failure, so other users are aware.
Hypothesis #2 - this is the author's case.
RSA.py looks for the following in PEM file to determine what kind of encryption was applied to PEM:
 Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED

When key is generated using ""openssl genrsa ..."" command, this string is present in PEM in clear, however when ""opensl genpkey ..."" is used the ""Proc-Type"" is not present.
RSA.py doesn't even try to decrypt the PEM if the ""Proc-Type"" is not found:
  # The encrypted PEM format
  if lines[1].startswith(b('Proc-Type:4,ENCRYPTED')):
     DEK = lines[2].split(b(':'))
     ....

So, my conclusion at this time is that keys generated by ""openssl genpkey"" are not supported by PyCrypto v 2.6.1.

It does work in PyCrypto's latest version 2.7a1. You can download it from here: http://ftp.dlitz.net/pub/dlitz/crypto/pycrypto/pycrypto-2.7a1.tar.gz

Is there any way to make it all works in Win7 x86 with Python3.4 installed?
Installed modules:

pip (1.5.6)
pyasn1 (0.1.7)
pycrypto (2.6.1)
PyYAML (3.11)
rsa (3.1.4)
setuptools (2.1)

Python version 3.4.1
","Super easy fix for ImportError: No module named 'winrandom' - this is where python is located on my Windows 10 system:
C:\Users\Charles\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35
But you have to go further to find the right file to update, so go here:
C:\Users\Charles\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35\Lib\site-packages\Crypto\Random\OSRNG\nt.py
Open the nt.py in any text editor and change just the line near the top:
import winrandom

should be:
from . import winrandom

Save the file - re-run what you were originally trying to run and you should be good.  Hope this helps someone!

You can also disable the warning on the command line when you invoke the script by passing the -W option to the interpreter like so:
$ python -W ignore::RandomPool_DeprecationWarning:Crypto.Utils.randpool: my_script.py

The -W takes filters in the format action:message:category:module:lineno, where this time module must exactly match the (fully-qualified) module name where the warning is raised.

","Did a bit of research for you, and here's the bug that was filed for the SDK:
http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=2493
Summary of the issue:
GAE has a customized version of PyCrypto 2.0.1 installed. Docs can be found here.
SDK does not include the PyCrypto implementation from GAE, so it needs to be installed locally. However, the default path for installation is blocked by the SDK. Solution recommended in the bug comments is to install PyCrypto in each app's directory. Steps are outlined in the bug comments (not trivial).

","Simply linking gmppylib is not helpful because pycrpto needs to compile some C files which will include gmp.h.  You should have the GMP library installed which will contain gmp.h. It seems you have to install GMP on your Mac OS. The following two links should be helpful to you.

","I finally realized that the root of my problem was in an incompatibility between the versions of Fabric and Pycrypto.  Once I downgraded my version of Fabric to 1.2.6, I no longer got the errors above.  Then, I used the tutorial as a jumping off point.  However, despite the tutorial and the older version of Fabric, I still got the PyCrypto >= 2.1, !=2.4 error.  I eventually installed Pycrypto 2.2 from source (since apparently pip will only install v. 2.0.1 even when designating pip -Iv install pycrypto==2.2 per this and v. 2.6 resulted in the gmp.h error).  Finally, everything worked.

","AES is a block cipher. Quote from the Wikipedia page: “a block cipher is a deterministic algorithm operating on fixed-length groups of bits”. 
AES can only work with blocks of 128 bits (that is, 16 chars, as you noticed).

","Just want to add info about mods of operations
Yes, AES is a 128-bit (16-byte) block cipher with multiple possible key length (128, 192, 256), but the cause of this text padding limitation (and error msg) is ECB mode of operation. ECB is the simplest of the encryption modes. I don't know your goals, so will just skip the part that it doesn't provide serious message confidentiality.
CBC and CTR are more common and usually appropriate to use and in CTR mode you don't need 128-bit message length.
There is also ciphertext stealing (CTS) method for ECB and CBC modes. 

Method of using a block cipher mode of operation that allows for
  processing of messages that are not evenly divisible into blocks
  without resulting in any expansion of the ciphertext, at the cost of
  slightly increased complexity

But Ciphertext stealing for ECB mode requires the plaintext to be longer than one 128-bit block.

print AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr).decrypt(ciphertext)

However, PyCrypto provides a counter method for you that should be much faster than pure Python:
import Crypto.Util.Counter
ctr = Crypto.Util.Counter.new(NUM_COUNTER_BITS)

ctr is now a stateful function (and, simultaneously, a callable object) that increments and returns its internal state every time you call it. You can then do 
print AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr).decrypt(ciphertext)

just as before.
Here's a working example using Crypto.Cipher.AES in CTR mode with a user-specified initialization vector:
import Crypto.Cipher.AES
import Crypto.Util.Counter

key = ""0123456789ABCDEF"" # replace this with a sensible value, preferably the output of a hash
iv = ""0000000000009001"" # replace this with a RANDOMLY GENERATED VALUE, and send this with the ciphertext!

plaintext = ""Attack at dawn"" # replace with your actual plaintext

ctr = Crypto.Util.Counter.new(128, initial_value=long(iv.encode(""hex""), 16))

cipher = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, Crypto.Cipher.AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr)
print cipher.encrypt(plaintext)

","The developer for PyCrypto pulled the specification for AES CBC Mode from NIST:
AES Mode_CBC -> referencing NIST 800-38a (The Recommendation for Cipher Mode Operations)
From that, page 8:
5.3  Initialization Vectors
The input to the encryption processes of the CBC, CFB, and OFB modes includes, in addition to the plaintext, a data block called the initialization vector (IV), denoted IV. The IV is used in an initial step in the encryption of a message and in the corresponding decryption of the message. 
The IV need not be secret; however, for the CBC and CFB modes, the IV for any particular 
execution of the encryption process must be unpredictable, and, for the OFB mode, unique IVs must be used for each execution of the encryption process.  The generation of IVs is discussed in Appendix C. 

Thing to remember, you need to use a random IV every time you compose a message, this adds a 'salt' to the message therefore making the message unique; even with the 'salt' being out in the open, it will not help break the encryption if the AES encryption key is unknown.  If you do not use a randomized IV, say, you use the same 16 bytes each message, your messages, if you repeat yourself, will look the same going across the wire and you could be subject to frequency and/or replay attacks.
A test for the results of random IVs vs static:
def test_crypto ():
    print(""Same IVs same key:"")
    key = generate_aes_key()
    iv = b""1234567890123456""
    msg = b""This is some super secret message.  Please don't tell anyone about it or I'll have to shoot you.""
    code = encrypt(key, iv, msg)
    print(code.encode('hex'))
    decoded = decrypt(key, iv, code)
    print(decoded)

    code = encrypt(key, iv, msg)
    print(code.encode('hex'))
    decoded = decrypt(key, iv, code)
    print(decoded)

    print(""Different IVs same key:"")
    iv = generate_aes_key()
    code = encrypt(key, iv, msg)
    print(code.encode('hex'))
    decoded = decrypt(key, iv, code)

","The behavior you see is specific to the CBC mode. With CBC, decryption can be visualized in the following way (from wikipedia):

You can see that IV only contributes to the first 16 bytes of plaintext. If the IV is corrupted while it is in transit to the receiver, CBC will still correctly decrypt all blocks but the first one. In CBC, the purpose of the IV is to enable you to encrypt the same message with the same key, and still get a totally different ciphertext each time (even though the message length may give something away).
Other modes are less forgiving. If you get the IV wrong, the whole message is garbled at decryption. Take CTR mode for instance, where nonce takes almost the same meaning of IV:

The custom fields documentation says to:

add __metaclass__ = models.SubfieldBase

So you think this would be easy enough - for 2. just decrypt the value, and 3. just encrypt it.
Based loosely on a django snippet, and the documentation this field looks like:
class EncryptedCharField(models.CharField):
  """"""Just like a char field, but encrypts the value before it enters the database, and    decrypts it when it

  else:
    encrypted = encryptor.decrypt(value)
    return DecryptedString(encrypted)


class EncryptedString(str):

class DecryptedString(str):
  pass

and the Encryptor looks like:
class Encryptor(object):
  def __init__(self, cipher_type):
    imp = __import__('Crypto.Cipher', globals(), locals(), [cipher_type], -1)
    self.cipher = getattr(imp, cipher_type).new(settings.SECRET_KEY[:32])

      value = EncryptedString(binascii.b2a_hex(self.cipher.encrypt(value)))
    return value

When saving a model, an error, Odd-length string, occurs, as a result of attempting to decrypt an already decrypted string.  When debugging, it appears as  to_python ends up being called twice, the first with the encrypted value, and the second time with the decrypted value, but not actually as a type Decrypted, but as a raw string, causing the error.  Furthermore get_prep_value is never called.

This should not be that hard - does anyone else think this Django field code is very poorly written, especially when it comes to custom fields, and not that extensible?  Simple overridable pre_save and post_fetch methods would easily solve this problem.
","You should be overriding to_python, like the snippet did.
If you take a look at the CharField class you can see that it doesn't have a value_to_string method:

django/db/models/fields/__init__.py

The docs say that the to_python method needs to deal with three things:

An instance of the correct type
A string (e.g., from a deserializer). 
Whatever the database returns for the column type you're using.

You are currently only dealing with the third case.
One way to handle this is to create a special class for a decrypted string:
class DecryptedString(str):
   pass

Then you can detect this class and handle it in to_python():
def to_python(self, value):
    if isinstance(value, DecryptedString):
        return value

    decrypted = self.encrypter.decrypt(encrypted)
    return DecryptedString(decrypted)

This prevents you from decrypting more than once.

    return value

When saving a model, an error, Odd-length string, occurs, as a result of attempting to decrypt an already decrypted string.  When debugging, it appears as  to_python ends up being called twice, the first with the encrypted value, and the second time with the decrypted value, but not actually as a type Decrypted, but as a raw string, causing the error.  Furthermore get_prep_value is never called.
What am I doing wrong?
This should not be that hard - does anyone else think this Django field code is very poorly written, especially when it comes to custom fields, and not that extensible?  Simple overridable pre_save and post_fetch methods would easily solve this problem.
","I think the issue is that to_python is also called when you assign a value to your custom field (as part of validation may be, based on this link). So the problem is to distinguish between to_python calls in the following situations:

When a value from the database is assigned to the field by Django (That's when you want to decrypt the value)
When you manually assign a value to the custom field, e.g. record.field = value

One hack you could use is to add prefix or suffix to the value string and check for that instead of doing isinstance check. 
I was going to write an example, but I found this one (even better :)).

"13077109","How can I create an encrypted django field that converts data when it's retrieved from the database?","I have a custom EncryptedCharField, which I want to basically appear as a CharField when interfacing UI, but before storing/retrieving in the DB it encrypts/decrypts it.
The custom fields documentation says to:

add __metaclass__ = models.SubfieldBase
override to_python to convert the data from it's raw storage into the desired format
override get_prep_value to convert the value before storing ot the db.

So you think this would be easy enough - for 2. just decrypt the value, and 3. just encrypt it.
Based loosely on a django snippet, and the documentation this field looks like:
class EncryptedCharField(models.CharField):
  """"""Just like a char field, but encrypts the value before it enters the database, and    decrypts it when it
  retrieves it""""""
  __metaclass__ = models.SubfieldBase
  def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super(EncryptedCharField, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    cipher_type = kwargs.pop('cipher', 'AES')
    self.encryptor = Encryptor(cipher_type)

  def get_prep_value(self, value):
     return encrypt_if_not_encrypted(value, self.encryptor)

  def to_python(self, value):
    return decrypt_if_not_decrypted(value, self.encryptor)


def encrypt_if_not_encrypted(value, encryptor):
  if isinstance(value, EncryptedString):
    return value
  else:
    encrypted = encryptor.encrypt(value)
    return EncryptedString(encrypted)

def decrypt_if_not_decrypted(value, encryptor):
  if isinstance(value, DecryptedString):
    return value
  else:
    encrypted = encryptor.decrypt(value)
    return DecryptedString(encrypted)


class EncryptedString(str):
  pass

class DecryptedString(str):
  pass

and the Encryptor looks like:
class Encryptor(object):
  def __init__(self, cipher_type):
    imp = __import__('Crypto.Cipher', globals(), locals(), [cipher_type], -1)
    self.cipher = getattr(imp, cipher_type).new(settings.SECRET_KEY[:32])

  def decrypt(self, value):
    #values should always be encrypted no matter what!
    #raise an error if tthings may have been tampered with
    return self.cipher.decrypt(binascii.a2b_hex(str(value))).split('\0')[0]

  def encrypt(self, value):
    if value is not None and not isinstance(value, EncryptedString):
      padding  = self.cipher.block_size - len(value) % self.cipher.block_size
      if padding and padding < self.cipher.block_size:
        value += ""\0"" + ''.join([random.choice(string.printable) for index in range(padding-1)])
      value = EncryptedString(binascii.b2a_hex(self.cipher.encrypt(value)))
    return value

When saving a model, an error, Odd-length string, occurs, as a result of attempting to decrypt an already decrypted string.  When debugging, it appears as  to_python ends up being called twice, the first with the encrypted value, and the second time with the decrypted value, but not actually as a type Decrypted, but as a raw string, causing the error.

","Since this question was originally answered, a number of packages have been written to solve this exact problem.  
For example, as of 2018, the package django-encrypted-model-fields handles this with a syntax like
from encrypted_model_fields.fields import EncryptedCharField

class MyModel(models.Model):
    encrypted_char_field = EncryptedCharField(max_length=100)
    ...

As a rule of thumb, it's usually a bad idea to roll your own solution to a security challenge when a more mature solution exists out there -- the community is a better tester and maintainer than you are.

If this is necessary, below are additional informations, which I don't exactly know how to interpret:
Brief technical information:

Format of digital signature: PKCS#7 “Signed-Data”
Public key procedure: DSS
Key length: 512 – 1024 bits
Public exponent:  2 +1
Public key format: X.509 v3 certificate
MD (Message Digest) algorithm: MD5 or RIPEMD-160 16

","I had the same problem and here are examples for both, generating and verifying with openssl and python. Hope this helps someone...
Bash:
#!/bin/bash
# Generate keys
openssl genrsa -out priv.pem
# Export public key
openssl rsa -pubout -in priv.pem -out pub.pem
# Create test file

# Create SHA1 signature
openssl dgst -sha1 -sign priv.pem -out test.txt.sig test.txt
# Verify SHA1 signature
openssl dgst -sha1 -verify pub.pem -signature test.txt.sig test.txt

Python:
#!/usr/bin/python
from Crypto.Signature import PKCS1_v1_5
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Hash import SHA
from Crypto import Random
# Read public key from file
fd = open('pub.pem', 'r')

fd.close()
# Create SHA1 hash object

# Create PKCS1 handler

# Read signature file

signature = fd.read()
fd.close()
# Verify signature

# Create PKCS1 handler
priv_cipher = PKCS1_v1_5.new(priv_key)
# Sign hash of test file content and compare
signature2 = priv_cipher.sign(h)
if signature == signature2:
    print ""Match!! :)""

After some more reading i've learned (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_1) that PKCS1_PSS is the new scheme that should be used to create signatures.
Both scripts needs some changes:
Bash:
#!/bin/bash
# Generate keys
openssl genrsa -out priv.pem
# Export public key
openssl rsa -pubout -in priv.pem -out pub.pem
# Create test file
echo test123 > test.txt
# Create SHA1 signature
openssl dgst -sha1 -sigopt rsa_padding_mode:pss -sigopt rsa_pss_saltlen:-1 -sign priv.pem -out test.txt.sig test.txt
# Verify SHA1 signature
openssl dgst -sha1 -sigopt rsa_padding_mode:pss -sigopt rsa_pss_saltlen:-1 -verify pub.pem -signature test.txt.sig test.txt

","As the PyCrypto API says, the IV must be a byte string, not a text string.
Your piece of code will work fine in Python 2, because they are the same thing (that is, they all are class str, unless you deal with Unicode text). In Python 3 they are two completely different types: bytes and str.
The code should therefore be:
iv = bytes([ random.randint(0,0xFF) for i in range(16)] )

Such code (beside not being cryptographically secure as Federico points out) will not properly work in Python 2 though. The following alternative works fine in both cases, it is secure and it is more efficient:

The only difference I see in the Ruby code and my code is that they are not specifying the Initialization Vector, therefore its falling back to the default of all \x0's

test = ""Very, very confidential data""
key = b'Thirty Two Byte key, made Beef y'

So I could specify the IV, that is not the problem pre se, but I am trying to figure out that if it thinks it cannot use the default, if there is something else wrong with the way I am using the library.
","This appears to be an error in the class documentation for Pycrypto's AES, as the AES implementation has been changed so that the IV is not optional for those modes that require one (i.e. you will have to pass 16 bytes of zeroes yourself, if that is how you want to do it).
See this bug report for the same issue where someone didn't specify an IV and looked up the online docs. There was a change that explicitly requires the IV and essentially, nobody has updated the online docs to reflect this. The class docs in the Pycrypto source were updated, but the online documentation needs to be regenerated to reflect this.
The new documentation from the source states:

For all other modes, it must be block_size bytes longs.

Instead of the old version's

For all other modes, it must be block_size bytes longs. It is optional and
  when not present it will be given a default value of all zeroes.

The updated example in the source, which specifies iv, is:
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto import Random

My guess is that you have the python-crypto-2.0.1 RPM installed system-wide,

Note that I am Not very Familiar With Python,  Just Need a way to encrypt data as  it will be one appengine . 
","Aha!
There's a difference of opinion what the ""256"" refers to.
AES has a fixed block size of 128 bits, so ""AES 256"" means 128 bit blocks, 256 bit key, 14 rounds.
However, Rijndael allows both the key size and the block size to vary. MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256 refers to Rijndael with block size set to 256 (and I don't know how many rounds). So it does indeed take a 32 byte IV. Your PHP script is not using AES 256.
This is confirmed in https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=47125 -- the reporter considers it a bug in PHP mcrypt, PHP considers it a bug in libmcrypt, but it's not a bug, since libmcrypt does document what MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256 means (at least the linux man page for mcrypt does, my Google-fu has failed to find any actual documentation for libmcrypt). That thing happens not to be the same as what AES 256 means.
So, you're encrypting and decrypting with ciphers that although related, might as well be completely different.
The bad news is that there doesn't appear to be a Crypto.Cipher.RIJNDAEL in PyCrypto. If you can pass a 256-bit key to MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128 in the PHP script, then that would be AES 256 (thanks Paŭlo).

"9893080","PyCrypto: Decrypt only with public key in file (no private+public key)","Hello everyone.
I am trying to play a bit with RSA public and private keys and encryption/decryption with PyCrypto and I have encountered and issue that seems kind of strange to me (it probably makes a lot of sense the way it's working now, but I don't know much about RSA asymmetric encryption and that's why it's puzzling me). It is the inability I have encountered to decrypt something having only the public key.
Here's the thing: I have a server and a client. I want the server to ""recognize"" and register the client and show it in a list of ""known devices"". The client will have the public key of the server and the server will have the public key of the client, so when the client communicates with the server, it will encrypt its data with his client's private key and with the server's public key. By doing this, only the proper server will be able to open the data (with its private key) and will be able to verify that the sender is actually the client that claims to be... well... or at least, that's what I think, because I'm pretty newbie in this asymmetric encryption. The idea is that when one of those clients wakes up, it will send its public key (encrypted with the server's public key, of course, but that's probably not relevant at this point... yet) saying ""Hey, I'm a new client and this is my public key. Register that key with my UUID"" and the server will obey, associating that public key with the client's UUID and use that key to decrypt data coming from that client. I just want to transmit the client's public key, keeping its private key secret, secret, secret (it's private, right?)
I am doing some tests with openssl and very simple Python scripts that use PyCrypto (actually, not even in a server/client architecture or anything... just trying to encrypt something with a private key and decrypt it with the public key)
First of all, I have created a public/private key set with:
openssl genrsa -out ~/myTestKey.pem -passout pass:""f00bar"" -des3 2048

Ok, first thing that puzzles me a bit... It generates only one file, with both the private and the public keys... Well... O'right... whatever. I can extract the public key with:
openssl rsa -pubout -in ~/myTestKey.pem -passin pass:""f00bar"" -out ~/myTestKey.pub

So I thought I had my couple of private (private+public, actually) and public keys in ~/myTestKey.pem and ~/myTestKey.pub respectively. Well... apparently I'm doing something wrong, because PyCrypto doesn't like this assembly. And I don't know why.
I have two very simple test scripts, ""encryptor.py"" and ""decryptor.py"". The ""encryptor.py"" should encrypt something with the private key, and ""decryptor.py"", decrypt it with the public key. I know... I'm a parangon of originality...
So, I encrypt the string ""Loren ipsum"" with my ""encryptor.py"" (with private key):
----------- encryptor.py ----------------
#!/usr/bin/python

from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

def encrypt(message):
    externKey=""/home/borrajax/myTestKey.pem""
    privatekey = open(externKey, ""r"")
    encryptor = RSA.importKey(privatekey, passphrase=""f00bar"")
    encriptedData=encryptor.encrypt(message, 0)
    file = open(""/tmp/cryptThingy.txt"", ""wb"")
    file.write(encriptedData[0])
    file.close()

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    encryptedThingy=encrypt(""Loren ipsum"")


And it works fine. Well... I suppose so, because in the file ""/tmp/cryptThingy.txt"" I get a lot of gibberish. It looks really, really encrypted to me.
But when I try to decrypt it using just the file that contains just the public key...
----------- decryptor.py ---------------
#!/usr/bin/python

from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

def decrypt():
    externKey=""/home/borrajax/myTestKey.pub""
    publickey = open(externKey, ""r"")
    decryptor = RSA.importKey(publickey, passphrase=""f00bar"")

TypeError: Private key not available in this object

Yeah, of course it's not available! I extracted the public key! It took me 2 hours finding how to do it properly!! 
What am I missing? As I said, I'm pretty newbie in this public/private asymmetric key encryption so I might have a core ""conceptual error""... Any hint will be appreciated.
¡Thank you in advance!
","You have it the wrong way round, you encrypt with the public key, and decrypt with the private key.

The publicly available encrypting-key is widely distributed, while the private decrypting-key is known only to the recipient. Messages are encrypted with the recipient's public key and can be decrypted only with the corresponding private key.
  Source

The idea is that you give the sending side the public key (which anyone can have, so you can distribute it in the open) then you encrypt the data with it, then decrypt it on your end with your private key (which only you have). This way the data stays secure.
You can encrypt something with the private key as the private key contains the information required to make the public key, but it would be unusual to do so, as normally the person encrypting the data does not have the private key.

Encryption Example:
>>> from Crypto.Cipher import Blowfish
>>> from Crypto import Random
>>> from struct import pack
>>>
>>> bs = Blowfish.block_size
>>> key = b'An arbitrarily long key'
>>> iv = Random.new().read(bs)
>>> cipher = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_CBC, iv)
>>> plaintext = b'docendo discimus '
>>> plen = bs - divmod(len(plaintext),bs)[1]
>>> padding = [plen]*plen
>>> padding = pack('b'*plen, *padding)
>>> msg = iv + cipher.encrypt(plaintext + padding)

I did not find any example on how to decrypt. 
","Let's make some observations:

CBC mode needs an Initialization Vector (IV) that has the same length as the block size
the full plaintext is the actual message including padding (PKCS#5 padding in RFC 2898 Sec. 6.1.1 Step 4)
the IV is prepended to the ciphertext

What needs to be done:

Use the same key
Read the IV before creating the decryptor
Remove padding after decryption by looking at the last byte, evaluate that as an integer and remove as many bytes from the end of the plaintext

Code:
from Crypto.Cipher import Blowfish
from struct import pack

bs = Blowfish.block_size
key = b'An arbitrarily long key'
ciphertext = b'\xe2:\x141vp\x05\x92\xd7\xfa\xb5@\xda\x05w.\xaaRG+U+\xc5G\x08\xdf\xf4Xua\x88\x1b'
iv = ciphertext[:bs]
ciphertext = ciphertext[bs:]

cipher = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_CBC, iv)
msg = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)

","I've seen the code posted on the internet. There are - in principle - not too many things wrong with it, but there is no need to invent your own padding. Furthermore, I don't see why the first padding character is called INTERRUPT. I presume that INTERRUPT and PAD is handled as a single byte (I'm not a Python expert).
The most common padding is PKCS#5 padding. It consists of N bytes with the value of the number of padding bytes. The padding used here looks more like 'ISO' padding, which consists of a single bit set to 1 to distinguish it from the data and other padding bits, and the rest is zero's. That would be code point \u0080 in code.
So the encryption (which can provide confidentiality of data) seems to be used correctly. It depends on the use case if you also need integrity protection and/or authentication, e.g. by using a MAC or HMAC. Of course, no legal guarantees or anything provided.

","You can construct a private from components in the following way (documentation):
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

# assume d was correctly calculated
n = 1234....L

I've barely started programming in python and my first interest as of now is to run that file.
I'm using:

Windows command prompt (cmd) to run
Python 3.6 (I'm uneasy about this, he run the code with 2.7)
Windows 8.1
Notepad++ to edit files
Visual C++ 2015 Build Tools which I was prompted to install from here.

Errors I'm getting:
However when I enter the command python main.py, I get the following error:

My Questions:
Am I doing something wrong? Is it a compatibility issue? How do I get around this?

(P.S.: Once again, this is my first time even using python – I'd be grateful if you could explain me this in the easiest way you can.) 
","It looks like PyCrypto is not being maintained currently. So, it's better you switch to PyCryptodome.
pip install pycryptodome

If you still want to use PyCrypto you could still try,

My Questions:
Am I doing something wrong? Is it a compatibility issue? How do I get around this?

(P.S.: Once again, this is my first time even using python – I'd be grateful if you could explain me this in the easiest way you can.) 
","If doing python -m Cryptodome.SelfTest is giving you an error, you can do:
pip uninstall pycryptodome

and then:
easy_install pycryptodome

Even after this, running python -m Cryptodome.SelfTest was giving me an error, but when I re-ran the file, it worked.

","Looks like this got a little more difficult with OSX 10.9. Here's the additional stuff I did:
brew install libffi
If you see the warning about how it's installed ""keg-only"", that means homebrew did not link it, so you'll need to provide some more info with export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig. At that point the install blows up because by default OSX now dies on warning flags, so suppress that behavior as well:
export CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments
export CPPFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments

Then you should be able to install with pip.

I don't understand what the randFunc is supposed to be in the getPrime function. 
","n_length is the ""size"" of the prime number. It will return a number around 2^n_length. randFunc is a callable function that accepts a single argument N and then returns a string of N random bytes. (os.urandom is an example of this). In most cases, randFunc can (and should) be omitted, since the default is PyCrypto's own random number generator.

"20057764","Python pyCrypto RSA encrypt method gives same results using private or public key","I'm trying to understand the pyCrypto encrypt and decrypt methods for public and private keys, and I'm seeing something strange. Suppose I have a set of private and public keys, stored in files dummy_private.txt and dummy_public.txt.
I create a private key object and public key object like this:
private_key_file='dummy_private.txt'
f = open(private_key_file, 'r')
privateKey = RSA.importKey(f.read(),None)
f.close()

public_key_file='dummy_public.txt'
f = open(public_key_file, 'r')
publicKey = RSA.importKey(f.read(),None)
f.close()

Now suppose I want to encrypt some message. I can do it like this:
s='This is a super secret message'
sutf8=s.encode('utf8')

enc=publicKey.encrypt(sutf8,None)[0]
encb64=base64.encodestring(enc)
print ""Public key Encoded message is %s"" % (encb64,)

This makes sense because I am encrypting with the public key and I should be able to decrypt with the private key.
However, I can also encrypt the above using the private key, and it gives me the same result!
enc2=privateKey.encrypt(sutf8,None)[0]
encb642=base64.encodestring(enc2)
print ""Private key Encoded message is %s"" % (encb642,)

When I print out the base64 encoded version of the encrypted data, using either the private key or the public key, they are the same! Why is that?
And this raises the problem of digitally signing something with the private key. If I can sign something with the public key and get the same results, then how does signing verify that I am who I say I am? This must be some issue with the encrypt method that I don't understand. Can someone please explain?
Since encrypting with both the public key and private key gives the same results, it appears that decrypting with the private key can be done regardless of whether the encryption was done with the private key or the public key. I'm totally confused as to why one could encrypt with the private key and get a result that is the same as if it were done with the public key.
","When you encrypt with a private key, pycrypto is actually using the public key (which can be generated from the private key).

You'll find that pycrypto doesn't allow you to decrypt using the public key for good reason:

TypeError: No private key

Mathematically, RSA makes it possible to encrypt with the private key and decrypt with the public key, but you're not supposed to do that.  The public key is PUBLIC - it's something you would readily share and thus would be easily disseminated.  There's no added value in that case compared to using a symmetric cipher and a shared key (see: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/2123/rsa-encryption-with-private-key-and-decryption-with-a-public-key)
Conceptually, ""encrypting"" with the private key is more useful for signing a message whereas the ""decryption"" using the public key is used for verifying the message.

When I was trying to install latest version I stumble upon ""Unable to find vcvarsall.bat"" error. I googled something about MinGW, so I installed that too. I've added it to my Windows PATH, but now i'm getting another error, which looks like this: ""command 'gcc' failed: no such file or directory."" What do i do now? Found something about gcc-mingw, which is some version of MinGW that could help? 
Why is has to be so damn complicated :D.

New development. Managed to install pycrytpo and fabric, but still can't run anything in the latter. New error says: ""ImportError: no module named win32api"". Quick google search says something about PyWin, but easy_install can't find it and it looks like it's abandoned. Any ideas?
","Well, it's so complicated because C (C++? Can't remember what they used at the moment, but I am pretty sure they used C) is much, much better at math than Python, so the math pieces of PyCrypto are all written in C. It does have a _slowmath module if the compiled versions aren't available, but it's name is telling... it is much slower.
gcc is the GNU Compiler Collection (<!-- an edit, I had thought it stood for GNU C Compiler, but apparently my knowledge was dated). It is a bit legendary, but apparently your version of Windows has not heard of it. First question though, have you closed the ""DOS prompt"" and restart it? (it's in quotes because the people at superuser once yelled at me because I did not sufficiently acknowledge its inferiority) Environment Variables in Windows do not update during a ""DOS session"" (or whatever it is supposed to be called).
If you have, chances are that it can be found inside of the MingW install director -- if there is a bin folder I'd check there first. If not, I would search for gcc.exe and make sure that it's path is part of PATH. Then,
If all else fails, you might be able to get more info on MingW here.

"6886240","Python - Pycrypto - Sending encrypted data over network","I am trying to get 2 programs to share encrypted data over a network using public keys, but I am stuck with a difficult problem : the information that is shared (the keys and/or the encrypted data) seems to get modified. I am hoping to keep the encrypted data format as well as the format of the keys as simple as possible in order to allow compatibility with other languages.
To break down the problem, I have created 2 programs : Keyreceive and Keysend.
They execute in this order : 

Keyreceive starts up and waits to receive the encrypted data
Keysend starts up and generates an RSA key, saving the exported private key to a file
Keysend encrypts a piece of data and sends it to Keyreceive over the network
Keyreceive imports the private key from the same file, and uses it to decrypt the encrypted data
Keysend also decrypts the encrypted data to verify the result

Keysend.py
import socket
import os
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto import Random

rng = Random.new().read
RSAkey = RSA.generate(1024, rng) 

privatekey = RSAkey
publickey = RSAkey.publickey()
print(privatekey.exportKey()) #export under the 'PEM' format (I think)
print(publickey.exportKey())

file = open(""Keys.txt"", ""w"")
file.write(privatekey.exportKey()) #save exported private key
file.close()

data = ""hello world""
enc_data = publickey.encrypt(data, 16) #encrypt message with public key
print(str(enc_data))

host = ""localhost""
port = 12800
connexion = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
connexion.connect((host, port))
connexion.send(str(enc_data)) # send encrypted data, this appears to be the source of the problem

dec_data = RSAkey.decrypt(enc_data) # test decryption
print(dec_data)

os.system(""pause"")

Keyreceive.py
import socket
import os
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto import Random

host = ''
port = 12800

connexion = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
connexion.bind((host, port))
connexion.listen(5)
clientconnexion, connexioninfo = connexion.accept()
enc_data = clientconnexion.recv(1024) # receive encrypted data
print(enc_data)

file = open(""Keys.txt"", ""r"")
privatestr = file.read() # retrieve exported private key from file
file.close()
print(privatestr)

privatekey = RSA.importKey(privatestr) # import private key
data = privatekey.decrypt(enc_data) # decrypt sent encrypted data
print(data)

os.system(""pause"")

After both files have finished decrypting the encrypted data, Keysender outputs the original message : ""hello world"", whereas Keyreceiver outputs gibberish.
If there is ""hidden"" information in the encrypted data and key formats, would there be some way of writing them in a ""pure"" text format?
","You're right about which line is the source of the problem.
connexion.send(str(enc_data))

enc_data here is a tuple, the first (and in fact only) element of which is a string containing the actual ciphertext. When you are calling str on it, you're getting Python's attempt to convert the tuple to a string, which is not what you want. If you change it to this:
connexion.send(enc_data[0])

then it should do what you want.

","The following one is a way to achieve your goal. There are other, probably better ways (e.g. based on Visual Studio), but this one has worked for me. Additionally, it does not use pip.
All operations are carried out on a command prompt.

Install Mingw, including MSYS and the Development Toolkit. This will give you a fairly complete Unix-like development environment.
Ensure that Mingw binaries are in PATH environment variable. You need MinGW\bin and MingGW\msys\1.0\bin. 
Download MPIR sources in a temporary directory. It is important you do not use 2.5.1 because of a bug that will break the build. 2.5.0 is fine.
Build the MPIR library. This is fairly straightforward: execute bash configure followed by make.
HACK #1 Copy libmpir.a from mpir-2.5.0\.libs into C:\Python2.7.1\libs. This is necessary because distutils is broken and I could not find a way to direct it to the correct library location.
HACK #2 Edit C:\Python2.7.1\Lib\distutils\cygwincompiler.py and remove any occurrance of the string -mno-cygwin. The reason is explained here.
Download PyCrypto sources and unpack them in another temporary directory.
Set CPPFLAGS environment variable to the MPIR directory, which contains mpir.h.
HACK 3 Edit setup.py and add the following line in build_extension method:  

self.__add_compiler_option(os.environ['CPPFLAGS'])

Run bash configure. You should see two lines saying:

checking for __gmpz_init in -lgmp... no
  checking for __gmpz_init in -lmpir... yes

Execute python setup.py build -c mingw32. You should see no errors.
Execute python setup.py test to verify that everything is fine.
Execute python setup.py install to copy the files into your local Python repository.
Alternatively, run python setup.py bdist_wininst to create an installer.

I really hate all the various hacks, and I'd love to hear if they can be avoided.

","Encryption (providing confidentiality)

If you want to encrypt/decrypt in the same application, then you simple should swap the public key and the private key.
Encryption is always performed by the public key, decryption by the private key.
RSA does not have any security if you do it the other way around. 
If you know the private key then a public key with a small public exponent can be easily guessed by an attacker.

Signature generation (providing authenticity & integrity)

From the code however it seems you want to sign a message, but you are using an algorithm (RSA OAEP) that has been designed explicitly for encryption. 
Unfortunately both concepts are not compatible. First of all, OAEP padding mechanism is not compatible with the one for signing.

Furthermore, there may be differences in handling the keys 

the library will handle private keys operations differently from public key operations. - - Private keys require security, such as protection against side channel attacks.
Note that that a public key allows for a larger range of values than a private key (the public exponent may be small or large, the private exponent should always be near the key size). 

So the components of a private key will always match those of a public key. But as public keys normally have a small public exponent, public keys may not always be accepted as private keys.

The only good solution is to replace your own signing operation with the correct one. - -- Fortunately Python handles PSS signing operations, take a look at the documentation here, which helpfully contains sample code.

As of version 2.4, Pycrypto says it supports python 3. 
I'ved added a symlink to the xcode developer folder:

but all that exists in that folder are MacOSX10.7.sdk MacOSX10.8.sdk (not MacOSX10.6.sdk as needed above). 
Am I missing anything in my system?  How can I tell it to use one of the other SDKs?
","Got it to work by doing the following:
As in the comment above, made sure the Command Line Tools are installed, which also installs the system headers:

Start Xcode, open Xcode -> Preferences... and go to the Downloads tab. Under Components make sure the Command Line Tools are installed; this will also install system headers in system folders.

As instructed in this answer, create a symbolic link to the developer folder:
sudo ln -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer /Developer

However, still go the error message: 
Compiling with an SDK that doesn't seem to exist: /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk

This relates to an issue that Python 3.2 assumes you are using Mac OSX 10.6
I fixed, this by faking the OSX 10.6 environment by creating a symbolic link from it to the OSX 10.8 environment:
sudo ln -s /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.8.sdk MacOSX10.6.sdk

"43199123","Encrypting with AES-256 and PKCS7 padding","I want to use python to encrypt some data and have come across pycrypto as a possible tool.  In order to encrypt the data, I need to:

Input passphrase string
SHA-256 the string, giving key for AES-256
Represent sensitive data as string of 9 digit characters (ascii), with leading ascii 0s if present (the data will always be in this format).
Encrypt data string using AES-256, NO SALT, using PKCS7 padding from RFC2315, in ecb mode. 
Represent ciphertext as Base64 (RFC 4648), needing 24 characters

Using pycrypto, steps 1-3 are fairly easy.  4 is giving me a little bit of trouble.  I'm not sure what PKCS7 padding is, and I am not sure how to ensure that the encryption is not using a SALT.  I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction re: step 4. 
","PyCrypto does not have inbuilt feature for padding. But it is quite easy to implement it. Note: PKCS7 Padding will add an extra byte block when the input is already the correct size, which this function does as well.
PKCS#7 padding is explained here.
def pad(m):
    return m+chr(16-len(m)%16)*(16-len(m)%16)

KEY = sha256(passphrase).digest()  #returns 256 bit key
cipher = AES.new(KEY,AES.MODE_ECB) #creates a AES-256 instance using ECB mode
ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(pad(data)).encode('base64')

Hopefully, this is what you are looking for. 
During the process of Decryption, the unpad function might come handy.
def unpad(ct):
    return ct[:-ct[-1]]

In Python 3, the unpad function may need to cast (depending on usage), looking like this:
def unpad(ct):
    return ct[:-ord(ct[-1])]

P.S,

ECB mode of encryption is not cryptographic secure. Please use higher modes such as CBC, OFB or GCM.
GCM or Galois/Counter Mode provides both data confidentiality as well as authentication (Even for associated data, which need not be encrypted).
It is the most secure mode yet unless you use the same nonce twice

I've tried several different modules, PyCrypto, M2Crypto, etc but can't seem to get the correct combination of changing the password to the right size key and encoding everything correctly.  I've found https://github.com/nvie/SimpleAES but that basically runs OpenSSL on the command line, which I'd rather avoid.
","Base 64 encoding and decoding can be easily handled via the standard base64 module.
AES-256 decryption and encryption in CBC mode are supported by both PyCrypto and M2Crypto.
The only non-standard (and most difficult) part is the derivation of the IV and the key from the password. OpenSSL does it via its own EVP_BytesToKey function, which is described in this man page.
The Python equivalent is:
def EVP_BytesToKey(password, salt, key_len, iv_len):
    """"""
    Derive the key and the IV from the given password and salt.
    """"""
    from hashlib import md5
    dtot =  md5(password + salt).digest()
    d = [ dtot ]
    while len(dtot)<(iv_len+key_len):
        d.append( md5(d[-1] + password + salt).digest() )
        dtot += d[-1]
    return dtot[:key_len], dtot[key_len:key_len+iv_len]

where key_len is 32 and iv_len is 16 for AES-256. The function returns the key and the IV which you can use to decrypt the payload.
OpenSSL puts and expects the salt in the first 8 bytes of the encrypted payload.
Finally, AES in CBC mode can only work with data aligned to the 16 byte boundary. The default padding used is PKCS#7.
The steps for encrypting are therefore:

Generate 8 bytes of random data as salt.
Derive AES key and IV from password using the salt from step 1.
Pad the input data with PKCS#7.
Encrypt the padded using AES-256 in CBC mode with the key and the IV from step 2.
Encode in Base64 and output the salt from step 1.
Encode in Base64 and output the encrypted data from step 4.

The steps from decrypting are the reverse:

Decode the input data from Base64 into a binary string.
Treat the first 8 bytes of the decoded data as salt.
Derive AES key and IV from password using the salt from step 1.
Decrypt the remaining decoded data using the AES key and the IV from step 3.
Verify and remove the PKCS#7 padding from the result.

You can see that the salt matches, and the key matches the first half of what OpenSSL shows, so I seem to be on the right track, but there are two main questions:

Why are the values for key and iv from OpenSSL twice as long as PyCrypto (and presumably AES256) allows?
How do I generate the correct values? The technique I'm using was taken from a blog, but if the IV is always supposed to match the block size (16 bytes), MD5 will never work. And even if I could figure out where the other half of the key comes from, PyCrypto would refuse it for being too long.

I realize I'll need to remove the padding as well, but I left that out for brevity.
","You have three problems:

You use AES256 (32 byte key) in OpenSSL and AES128 (16 byte key) in your python code.
The IV computation is wrong. Each step in the OpenSSL's key derivation function uses the the MD5 digest computed last.
You mix up binary and hexadecimal representation. Keep any conversion to hexadecimal as the last step, before visualization.

The following code should be correct:
from base64 import b64decode, b64encode
from binascii import hexlify

from Crypto.Hash import MD5

secret = 'secret'
encoded = 'U2FsdGVkX1+4mP5A7IFV/VcgRs4ci/yupMErHjf5bkT5XrcowXK7z3VyyV1l2jvy'

","According to the pyinstaller manual:

You can verify that hidden import is the problem by using Python's verbose imports flag. If the import messages say ""module not found"", but the warnproject.txt file has no ""no module named..."" message for the same module, then the problem is a hidden import.
Hidden imports are handled by hooking the module (the one doing the hidden imports) at Analysis time. Do this as follows:

Create a file named hook-module.py (where module is the fully-qualified Python name, eg, hook-xml.dom.py) and place it somewhere. Remember the place as your private hooks directory.
In the .spec file, pass your private hooks directory as hookspath argument to Analysis so will be searched. Example:
a = Analysis(['myscript.py'], hookspath='/my/priv/hooks') 
  In most cases the hook module will have only one line:
hiddenimports = ['module1', 'module2']
  When the Analysis finds this file, it will proceed exactly as though the module explicitly imported module1 and module2.


This question seems related, the answers might also be useful for you.
Finally, this report seems to contain a similar problem. The user seemingly was able to fix it by updating to pyinstaller 2.1, so you might want to give that a try if you haven't already.

"15034267","HMAC-SHA256 with AES-256 in CBC mode","I recently came across the following code sample for encrypting a file with AES-256 CBC with a SHA-256 HMAC for authentication and validation:
aes_key, hmac_key = self.keys
# create a PKCS#7 pad to get us to `len(data) % 16 == 0`
pad_length = 16 - len(data) % 16
data = data + (pad_length * chr(pad_length))
# get IV
iv = os.urandom(16)
# create cipher
cipher = AES.new(aes_key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
data = iv + cipher.encrypt(data)
sig = hmac.new(hmac_key, data, hashlib.sha256).digest()
# return the encrypted data (iv, followed by encrypted data, followed by hmac sig):
return data + sig

Since, in my case, I'm encrypting much more than a string, rather a fairly large file, I modified the code to do the following:
aes_key, hmac_key = self.keys
iv = os.urandom(16)
cipher = AES.new(aes_key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)

with open('input.file', 'rb') as infile:
    with open('output.file', 'wb') as outfile:
        # write the iv to the file:
        outfile.write(iv)

        # start the loop
        end_of_line = True

        while True:
            input_chunk = infile.read(64 * 1024)

            if len(input_chunk) == 0:
                # we have reached the end of the input file and it matches `% 16 == 0`
                # so pad it with 16 bytes of PKCS#7 padding:
                end_of_line = True
                input_chunk += 16 * chr(16)
            elif len(input_chunk) % 16 > 0:
                # we have reached the end of the input file and it doesn't match `% 16 == 0`
                # pad it by the remainder of bytes in PKCS#7:
                end_of_line = True
                input_chunk_remainder = 16 - (len(input_chunk) & 16)
                input_chunk += input_chunk_remainder * chr(input_chunk_remainder)

            # write out encrypted data and an HMAC of the block
            outfile.write(cipher.encrypt(input_chunk) + hmac.new(hmac_key, data, 
                    hashlib.sha256).digest())

            if end_of_line:
                break

Simply put, this reads an input file in blocks of 64KB at a time and encrypts these blocks, generating a HMAC using SHA-256 of the encrypted data, and appending that HMAC after each block. Decryption will happen by reading in 64KB + 32B chunks and calculating the HMAC of the first 64KB and comparing it against the SHA-256 sum occupying the last 32 bytes in the chunk.
Is this the right way to use an HMAC? Does it ensure security and authentication that the data was unmodified and decrypted with the right key? 
FYI, the AES and HMAC keys are both derived from the same passphrase which is generated by running the input text through SHA-512, then through bcrypt, then through SHA-512 again. The output from the final SHA-512 is then split into two chunks, one used for the AES password and the other used for the HMAC.
","I don't think there is a security problem with what you're doing with the HMACs (not that that means there isn't a problem with the security), but I don't know the actual value in HMAC sub elements of the ciphertext gets you.  Unless you want to support partial recovery of the plaintext in the event of tampering, there is not much reason to incur the overhead of HMACing 64 KB blocks, vs the full ciphertext.
From a key generation perspective, it might make more sense to use a key generated from a passphrase to encrypt two randomly generated keys, and then use the randomly generated keys to perform HMAC and AES operations.  I know using the same key for both your block cipher and HMAC is bad news, but I don't know if using a key generated in the same manner is similarly bad. 
At the very least, you should tweak your key derivation mechanism. bcrypt is a password hashing mechanism, not a key derivation function.  You should use PBKDF2 to do key derivations.

","Yes, there are 2 security problems.
But first, I assume that with this statement at the end:

you actually meant:
# write out encrypted data and an HMAC of the block
data = cipher.encrypt(input_chunk)
outfile.write(data + hmac.new(hmac_key, data, hashlib.sha256).digest())

Because data is not defined anywhere.
The 1st security problem is that you are authenticating each piece independently of the others, but not the composition. In other words, the attacker can reshuffle, duplicate, or remove any of the chunks and the receiver will not notice.
A more secure approach is to have one instance of HMAC only, pass all the encrypted data to it via the update method, and output one digest, at the very end.
Alternatively, if you want to enable the receiver to detect tampering before receiving the whole file, you can output the intermediate MAC for each piece. In fact, a call to digest does not change the state of the HMAC; you can keep calling update afterwards.
The 2nd security problem is that you don't use salt for your key derivation (I say that because you don't send it). Apart from password cracking, if you encrypt more than 2 files using the same password the attacker will also be able to freely mix chunks taken by either encrypted file - because the HMAC key is the same. Solution: use salt.
One last minor thing: infile.read(64 * 1024) may return less than 64*1024 bytes, but that does not mean you reached the end of the file.

"10212515","PyCrypto: Encrypt an string twice using RSA and PKCS#1","Hello everyone.
I was wondering if it's possible to do a double RSA/PKCS#1 encryption with PyCrypto.
I have a server that has its own RSA key (generated with the openssl command when said server is installed) and a client which can request the public part of the server's key. Also, that client can ask the server to generate another RSA key (or key-pair) for it. In that case, the server also keeps the private (or the ""whole"" RSA key) and sends the client the public part of its key.
I've been playing around with RSA/PKCS and AES encription. I have created a test Python file that works fine encrypting with only one RSA key. What it does is encrypting the data with the symmetric AES system (which uses a random key generated ""on-the-fly""), cyphers the password used for AES using the RSA/PKCS#1 system and puts it in the result to be sent:

As you can see, the AES password is encrypted with the server's RSA key. Now, I'd like to be extra paranoid, and encrypt that already encrypted password with the Client's public key, so the ""encrypt"" method would be something like:
def encrypt(string):
    #Begin RSA Part to get a cypher that uses the server's public key
    externServerKeyFilename=""/home/borrajax/rsaKeys/server-key.pub""
    externServerKeyFile = open(externServerKeyFilename, ""r"")
    rsaServerKey= RSA.importKey(externServerKeyFile, passphrase=""F00bAr"")
    pkcs1ServerEncryptor=PKCS1_OAEP.new(rsaServerKey)
    #End RSA Part

    #Begin RSA Part to get a cypher that uses the client's public key
    externClientKeyFilename=""/home/borrajax/rsaKeys/client-key.pub""
    externClientKeyFile = open(externClientKeyFilename, ""r"")
    rsaClientKey= RSA.importKey(externClientKeyFile, passphrase=""F00bAr"")
    pkcs1ClientEncryptor=PKCS1_OAEP.new(rsaClientKey)
    #End RSA Part


    #Begin AES Part
    iv = ''.join(chr(random.randint(0, 0xFF)) for i in range(16))
    thisMessagePassword = os.urandom(16)
    aesEncryptor = AES.new(thisMessagePassword, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    chunksize=64*1024
    #End AES Part

    #Begin RSA Encription of the AES Key
    rsaEncryptedPasswordWithServer = pkcs1ServerEncryptor.encrypt(thisMessagePassword)
    rsaEncryptedPasswordWithServerAndClient = pkcs1ClientEncryptor.encrypt(rsaEncryptedPasswordWithServer) #Katacrasssshh here!! 

    retvalTmp = cStringIO.StringIO()
    retvalTmp.write(struct.pack('<Q', len(string)))
    retvalTmp.write(struct.pack('<Q', len(rsaEncryptedPasswordWithServerAndClient)))
    #...Probably some yadda yadda here with key lengths and stuff so it would help re-build the keys in the server's side...
    retvalTmp.write(rsaEncryptedPasswordWithServerAndClient)
    retvalTmp.write(iv)
    while len(string) > 0:
        chunk = string[0:chunksize]
        string = string[chunksize:]
        if len(chunk) % 16 != 0:
            chunk += ' ' * (16 - len(chunk) % 16)
        retvalTmp.write(aesEncryptor.encrypt(chunk))
    return retvalTmp.getvalue()

But when I try to re-encrypt the key, I get a ValueError(""Plaintext too large"") exception. Which makes sense (at least makes sense to someone who barely knows anything about encryption) because PKCS adds a padding so when I encrypt the ""thisMessagePassword"" with the server's public key, I get a 256 bytes string, which is too long for the second PKCS encryptor (I've been doing some ""manual testing"" and the limit seems to be 214 bytes... I mean... that is the last value that doesn't throw an exception).
I am aware that is probably a weird construct and that it would probably make more sense use the server's public key for encryption and signing with the client's key, but I'm just trying to play a bit with encryption things and try to understand how they work and why. That's why any hint will be appreciated.
Thank you in advance!
","So, what you are doing seems to make little sense. 
You want to securely  send a message from a server to a client?
The code you have attempts to  encrypt a message under the severs public key, then under the client's public key. The client won't be able to read this because he should never ever have the server's private key (Which is needed to read the message encrypted under the servers public key). Or put another way, if the server and client both have the same private key, then you should just use AES. Why are you doing this ? 
Really, you probably ought to just send a message to the client using ssl/tls/https ,since writing cryptographic code is problematic and you have made at least two bad errors in your code along with the one you want fixed. 

Your IV needs to be securely random. The python random call is not, which is why you use os.random(16) for the key. you should do so for the IV as well
You need to use an hmac to authenticate the encrypted data and key the hmac with a separate random key.   Then using the same key on the other end, regenerate the hmac over the same inputs, and compare the two. If  you don't do this, someone could tamper with your data and use errors in the crypto libraries to read it.
The problem you posted: Note as I said above you should not be doing this at all because it's nonsensical. You need to encrypted rsaEncryptedPasswordWithServer with AES under a new key(and use HMAC as per 2 above) and then encrypt the new key with the clients public key.

"10212515","PyCrypto: Encrypt an string twice using RSA and PKCS#1","Hello everyone.
I was wondering if it's possible to do a double RSA/PKCS#1 encryption with PyCrypto.
I have a server that has its own RSA key (generated with the openssl command when said server is installed) and a client which can request the public part of the server's key. Also, that client can ask the server to generate another RSA key (or key-pair) for it. In that case, the server also keeps the private (or the ""whole"" RSA key) and sends the client the public part of its key.
I've been playing around with RSA/PKCS and AES encription. I have created a test Python file that works fine encrypting with only one RSA key. What it does is encrypting the data with the symmetric AES system (which uses a random key generated ""on-the-fly""), cyphers the password used for AES using the RSA/PKCS#1 system and puts it in the result to be sent:

As you can see, the AES password is encrypted with the server's RSA key. Now, I'd like to be extra paranoid, and encrypt that already encrypted password with the Client's public key, so the ""encrypt"" method would be something like:
def encrypt(string):
    #Begin RSA Part to get a cypher that uses the server's public key
    externServerKeyFilename=""/home/borrajax/rsaKeys/server-key.pub""
    externServerKeyFile = open(externServerKeyFilename, ""r"")

    pkcs1ClientEncryptor=PKCS1_OAEP.new(rsaClientKey)
    #End RSA Part


    #Begin AES Part
    iv = ''.join(chr(random.randint(0, 0xFF)) for i in range(16))
    thisMessagePassword = os.urandom(16)
    aesEncryptor = AES.new(thisMessagePassword, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    chunksize=64*1024
    #End AES Part

    #Begin RSA Encription of the AES Key
    rsaEncryptedPasswordWithServer = pkcs1ServerEncryptor.encrypt(thisMessagePassword)
    rsaEncryptedPasswordWithServerAndClient = pkcs1ClientEncryptor.encrypt(rsaEncryptedPasswordWithServer) #Katacrasssshh here!! 

    retvalTmp = cStringIO.StringIO()
    retvalTmp.write(struct.pack('<Q', len(string)))
    retvalTmp.write(struct.pack('<Q', len(rsaEncryptedPasswordWithServerAndClient)))
    #...Probably some yadda yadda here with key lengths and stuff so it would help re-build the keys in the server's side...
    retvalTmp.write(rsaEncryptedPasswordWithServerAndClient)
    retvalTmp.write(iv)
    while len(string) > 0:
        chunk = string[0:chunksize]
        string = string[chunksize:]
        if len(chunk) % 16 != 0:
            chunk += ' ' * (16 - len(chunk) % 16)
        retvalTmp.write(aesEncryptor.encrypt(chunk))
    return retvalTmp.getvalue()

But when I try to re-encrypt the key, I get a ValueError(""Plaintext too large"") exception. Which makes sense (at least makes sense to someone who barely knows anything about encryption) because PKCS adds a padding so when I encrypt the ""thisMessagePassword"" with the server's public key, I get a 256 bytes string, which is too long for the second PKCS encryptor (I've been doing some ""manual testing"" and the limit seems to be 214 bytes... I mean... that is the last value that doesn't throw an exception).
I am aware that is probably a weird construct and that it would probably make more sense use the server's public key for encryption and signing with the client's key, but I'm just trying to play a bit with encryption things and try to understand how they work and why. That's why any hint will be appreciated.
Thank you in advance!
","The documentation of PKCS1OAEP.encrypt says the following about its input:

message (string) - The message to encrypt, also known as plaintext. It can be of variable length, but not longer than the RSA modulus (in bytes) minus 2, minus twice the hash output size.

SHA-1 (the default hash function) has a 160 bit digest, that is 20 bytes. The limitation that you see sounds about right: 256 = 214 + 2 + 2*20.
Beside that, the extra step you plan to add does not add much value. If you want the client to prove to the server it's really him, and not somebody else, you should provide the client with the private key and have the server to keep the public half. After the encryption step, the client could sign the whole package (wrapped AES key + encrypted data) with PKCS#1 PSS and send the signature along. The server will verify the origin with the client's public key, then decrypt the key using its own private key, and finally decrypt the data with AES.

","I'm not recommending you do this, or suggesting it makes any sense, but if you just want to play with it here is what you can do.

Make sure the modulus of the first RSA key you apply is less than the the modulus of the second RSA key you apply.
Perform the first RSA encryption using the smaller modulus and proper PKCS#1 padding
Perform the second RSA encryption using the larger modulus and no padding.

On decrypt you must reverse the order of these operations of course.

Thank you!
","Tell the computer you are dealing with hex. It is treating it as a string.

I am converting the enc_key to a string so that I can write it to a text file, otherwise enc_key.txt will contain rubbish. The problem however, is that in another script, meant for decrypting enc_key to get the original AES key used to encrypt the files, trying to decrypt the enc_key which has been converted to a string produces an error:

","Use base 64 instead of converting directly to a string.
Beware of the documentation of the encrypt method you are using:

Returns:
     A tuple with two items. The first item is the ciphertext of the same type as the plaintext (string or long). The second item is always None.
  Overrides: pubkey.pubkey.encrypt

Furthermore, you should heed the following advice:

Attention: this function performs the plain, primitive RSA encryption (textbook). In real applications, you always need to use proper cryptographic padding, and you should not directly encrypt data with this method. Failure to do so may lead to security vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use modules Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEP or Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_v1_5 instead.

","Even though more than one year has passed since you asked the question, I nevertheless want to provide an actual answer to your problem, because I have myself struggled with this minute yet uncomfortable error, so that anyone who encounters this situation would be able to quickly solve it.
First of all, as the other answer suggests, for human readability I would use base64 encoding:
enc_key = RSAkey.encrypt(key, '')

enc_key = base64.b64encode(enc_key[0]) 

where [0] represents the first value of the tuple which is generated by the encrypt method (the ciphertext itself).
Then, when you want to decrypt the whole thing, you call:
aes_key = RSAkey.decrypt(base64.b64decode(enc_key))

which should return you the original plaintext without the ValueError: Message too large

From one web page, it tells me that JS has two way to encrypt password 
(reference link ):


a. crypto.createCipher(algorithm, password)
b. crypto.createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv)


What I saw in JavaScript should be option a. However, only option b is equivalent to AES.new() in python.
The questions are:

How can I restore this password in Python without changing JavaScript code? 
If I need IV in Python, how can I get it from the password that is used in JavaScript? 

","You will have to implement OpenSSL's EVP_BytesToKey, because that is what CryptoJS uses to derive the key and IV from the provided password, but pyCrypto only supports the key+IV type encryption. CryptoJS also generates a random salt which also must be send to the server. If the ciphertext object is converted to a string, then it uses automatically an OpenSSL-compatible format which includes the random salt.


var data = ""Some semi-long text for testing"";
var password = ""some password"";
var ctObj = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(data, password);
var ctStr = ctObj.toString();

out.innerHTML = ctStr;

CryptoJS defaults to 256 bit key size for AES, PKCS#7 padding and CBC mode. AES has a 128 bit block size which is also the IV size. This means that we have to request 32+16 = 48 byte from EVP_BytesToKey. I've found a semi-functional implementation here and extended it further.
Here is the full Python (tested with 2.7 and 3.4) code, which is compatible with CryptoJS:

from hashlib import md5

BLOCK_SIZE = 16

def pad(data):
    length = BLOCK_SIZE - (len(data) % BLOCK_SIZE)
    return data + (chr(length)*length).encode()

    return data[:-(data[-1] if type(data[-1]) == int else ord(data[-1]))]

    assert len(salt) == 8, len(salt)
    data += salt
    key = md5(data).digest()
    final_key = key
    while len(final_key) < output:
        key = md5(key + data).digest()
        final_key += key
    return final_key[:output]

def encrypt(message, passphrase):

    key_iv = bytes_to_key(passphrase, salt, 32+16)
    key = key_iv[:32]

print(""pt"", pt)

print(""pt"", decrypt(encrypt(pt, password), password))


Similar code can be found in my answers for Java and PHP.
JavaScript AES encryption in the browser without HTTPS is simple obfuscation and does not provide any real security, because the key must be transmitted alongside the ciphertext.

Edit the file lib/Crypto/Random/OSRNG/nt.py and replace import winrandom with from Crypto.Random.OSRNG import winrandom.
Run the following from cmd python setup.py build -c msvc python setup.py install python setup.py test

openssl genrsa -out ""/tmp/myKey.pem"" -passout pass:""f00bar"" -des3 2048

Now, I would like to do that inside a Python script, using PyCrypto, if possible. I have seen this message, which seems to discourage the use of PyCrypto to do that. Is it still like that?
Of course I can always call os.execute, and execute the above command, but I'd consider that ""cheating"" :-). I'm pretty much doing this to learn PyCrypto.
Thank you in advance.
","Starting from PyCrypto 2.5 you can export an RSA private key and have it protected under a passphrase. A Triple DES key is internally derived from the passphrase and used to perform the actual encryption.
For instance:
from Crypto import RSA
from Crypto import Random

random_generator = Random.new().read
key = RSA.generate(1024, random_generator)
exportedKey = key.exportKey('PEM', 'my secret', pkcs=1)

The variable exportedKey contains an ASCII version (PEM) of the key, encoded according to PKCS#1 (a cryptographic standard. Another option is pkcs=8 for - guess what - PKCS#8). Since the result is standard, you can use it with several other programs, including openssl.
And of course, you can also re-import it back into python via PyCrypto!
The exportKey method is documented here.

"41980931","Image encryption and decryption using Pycrypto","How can I encrypt images using the Pycrypto python library? I found some text encrypting examples on internet, but I didn't find the same with images. Can anyone help me?
","It is just the same as encrypting or decrypting text.
Example
First import some modules:
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto import Random

After that, let us generate a key and an initialisation vector.
key = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)

Encryption
Now the code below loads an input file input.jpg and encrypts it, and afterwards it saves the encrypted data on a file encrypted.enc. In this example, the AES block cipher is used with the CFB mode of operation.
input_file = open(""input.jpg"")
input_data = input_file.read()
input_file.close()

cfb_cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
enc_data = cfb_cipher.encrypt(input_data)

enc_file = open(""encrypted.enc"", ""w"")
enc_file.write(enc_data)
enc_file.close()

Decryption
Finally, the code below loads the encrypted file encrypted.enc and decrypts it, and afterwards it saves the decrypted data on a file output.jpg. 
enc_file2 = open(""encrypted.enc"")
enc_data2 = enc_file2.read()
enc_file2.close()

cfb_decipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
plain_data = cfb_decipher.decrypt(enc_data2)

output_file = open(""output.jpg"", ""w"")
output_file.write(plain_data)
output_file.close()

Note
For simplicity, the encryption and the decryption have been done in the same Python session, so the variables key and iv have been reused immediately, and to test this solution you have to do encryption and decryption in the same Python session. Of course, if you want to decrypt later in a separate session you will need to save key and iv and to reload them when you need to decrypt.
Testing the solution
Now you can open the output.jpg file and you should see an image which is identical to the one in input.jpg.

","urandom does return cryptographically secure numbers, with a caveat. If it runs out of entropy (real random data generated by mouse movement, CPU temperature fluctuations on Ivy Bridge+ chips, etc), it will start producing less secure pseudo-random numbers. These are generated by a strong generator, but depending on your application they may not be random enough. On Unix systems, /dev/random will block while waiting for more entropy, while /dev/urandom will start generating pseudo-random numbers.
I'm not knowledgeable on PyCrypto, however on reading the source, it seems the Crypto/Random/OSRNG/posix.py simply reads from /dev/urandom - so I wouldn't worry too much about the choice.

","I go for os.urandom. On all (recent) Python implementations I checked, it does the correct thing by simply opening an unbuffered connection to /dev/urandom or the equivalent device on other non-Linux platforms.
On the other hand, PyCrypto's Crypto.Random is a very complex wrapper based on Fortuna. Such complex construction was probably done in the hope of mitigating some flaws of the underlying OS. Unfortunately:

It still pulls entropy from /dev/urandom (on Linux), so if the OS is broken, PyCrypto's Crypto.Random will be broken too (defeating its purpose)
That choice has backfired, since it is very hard to deal with forking and cases where the same entropy gets reused by different processes (see CVE-2013-1445).
The Fortuna code is not covered at all by unit tests and Fortuna algorithm itself does not come with test vectors. That alone forces you to make a (big) leap of faith.

Here is an example I found regarding using PyCrypto.
","You're better off with simple hashing (which is like one way encryption). To do this just use the md5 function to make a digest and then base64 or base16 encode it. Please note that base64 strings can include +, = or /.
import md5
import base64

def obfuscate(s):
    return base64.b64encode( md5.new(s).digest())

def obfuscate2(s):
    return base64.b16encode( md5.new(s).digest())

# returns alphanumeric string but strings can also include slash, plus or equal i.e. /+=
print obfuscate('Tag 1')
print obfuscate('Tag 2')
print obfuscate('Tag 3')

# return hex string
print obfuscate2('Tag 1')

As has been commented md5 is rapidly losing its security, so if you want to have something more reliable for the future, use the SHA-2 example below.
import hashlib

def obfuscate(s):
    m = hashlib.sha256()
    m.update(s)
    return m.hexdigest()

print obfuscate('Tag 1')
print obfuscate('Tag 2')
print obfuscate('Tag 3')

One more function - this time generate about 96-bit* digest using SHA-2 and truncating the output so that we can restrict it to 16 alphanum chars. This give slightly more chance of collision but should be good enough for most practical purposes.
import hashlib
import base64

def obfuscate(s):
    m = hashlib.sha256()
    m.update(s)
    hash = base64.b64encode(m.digest(), altchars=""ZZ"")  # make one way base64 encode, to fit characters into alphanum space only
    return hash[:16]    # cut of hash at 16 chars - gives about 96 bits which should 
    # 96 bits means 1 in billion chance of collision if you have 1 billion tags (or much lower chance with fewer tags)

","To make a string longer, you could try the following;

first compress it with bzip2
then make it readable again with base64 encoding

Like this:
import bz2
import base64
base64.b64encode(bz2.compress('012345'))

This will yield:
'QlpoOTFBWSZTWeEMDLgAAAAIAH4AIAAhgAwDJy7i7kinChIcIYGXAA=='

Due to the bzip2 header, the first 13 character will always be the same, so you should discard them;
base64.b64encode(bz2.compress('012345'))[14:]

This gives:
 'EMDLgAAAAIAH4AIAAhgAwDJy7i7kinChIcIYGXAA=='

Note that this is not cryptographically secure; it is trivial to invert if you know the recipe that is used:
foo = base64.b64encode(bz2.compress('012345'))
bz2.decompress(base64.b64decode(foo))

gives:
'012345'

What I am doing wrong ?

","There are many problems with your Python code and CryptoJS code:

You use a random IV to encrypt some plaintext in Python. If you want to retrieve that plaintext, you need to use the same IV during decryption. The plaintext cannot be recovered without the IV. Usually the IV is simply prepended to the ciphertext, because it doesn't have to be secret. So you need to read the IV during decryption and not generate a new one.
You use CBC mode in CryptoJS (default) instead of CFB mode. The mode has to be the same. The other tricky part is that CFB mode is parametrized with a segment size. PyCrypto uses by default 8-bit segments (CFB8), but CryptoJS is only implemented for fixed segments of 128-bit (CFB128). Since the PyCrypto version is variable, you need to change that.
The CryptoJS decrypt() function expects as ciphertext either an OpenSSL formatted string or a CipherParams object. Since you don't have an OpenSSL formatted string, you have to convert the ciphertext into an object.
The key for CryptoJS is expected to be a WordArray and not a string.
Use the same padding. PyCrypto doesn't pad the plaintext if CFB8 is used, but padding is needed when CFB128 is used. CryptoJS uses PKCS#7 padding by default, so you only need to implement that padding in python.

Python code (for version 2):
def pad(data):
    length = 16 - (len(data) % 16)
    return data + chr(length)*length

def unpad(data):
    return data[:-ord(data[-1])]

def encrypt(message, passphrase):
    IV = Random.new().read(BLOCK_SIZE)
    aes = AES.new(passphrase, AES.MODE_CFB, IV, segment_size=128)
    return base64.b64encode(IV + aes.encrypt(pad(message)))

def decrypt(encrypted, passphrase):
    encrypted = base64.b64decode(encrypted)
    IV = encrypted[:BLOCK_SIZE]
    aes = AES.new(passphrase, AES.MODE_CFB, IV, segment_size=128)
    return unpad(aes.decrypt(encrypted[BLOCK_SIZE:]))

JavaScript code:
<script src=""https://cdn.rawgit.com/CryptoStore/crypto-js/3.1.2/build/rollups/aes.js""></script>
<script src=""https://cdn.rawgit.com/CryptoStore/crypto-js/3.1.2/build/components/mode-cfb-min.js""></script>
<script>
    var base64ciphertextFromPython = ""..."";
    var ciphertext = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(base64ciphertextFromPython);

    // split iv and ciphertext
    var iv = ciphertext.clone();
    iv.sigBytes = 16;
    iv.clamp();
    ciphertext.words.splice(0, 4); // delete 4 words = 16 bytes
    ciphertext.sigBytes -= 16;

    var key = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(""1234567890123456"");

    // decryption
    var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt({ciphertext: ciphertext}, key, {

    });

</script>


Other considerations:
It seems that you want to use a passphrase as a key. Passphrases are usually human readable, but keys are not. You can derive a key from a passphrase with functions such as PBKDF2, bcrypt or scrypt.
The code above is not fully secure, because it lacks authentication. Unauthenticated ciphertexts may lead to viable attacks and unnoticed data manipulation. Usually the an encrypt-then-MAC scheme is employed with a good MAC function such as HMAC-SHA256.

","(1 Year later but I hope this works for someone)
First of all, thanks Artjom B. your post helps me a lot. And Like OP, I have the same same problem Python server endonding and Javascript client decoding. This was my solution:

Python 3.x (Server)
I used an excplicit PKCS7 encode for padding, why? because I want to be sure Im using the same padding enconding and decoding, this is the link where I found it http://programmerin.blogspot.com.co/2011/08/python-padding-with-pkcs7.html .
Then, like Artjom B. said, be sure about your segment size, IV size and AES mode (CBC for me),
This is the code:
def encrypt_val(clear_text):
    master_key = '1234567890123456' 
    encoder = PKCS7Encoder()
    raw = encoder.encode(clear_text)
    iv = Random.new().read( 16 )
    cipher = AES.new( master_key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv, segment_size=128 )
    return base64.b64encode( iv + cipher.encrypt( raw ) ) 

Note than your are enconding on base64 the concatenation of IV and encryption data.

Javascript (client)
function decryptMsg (data) {
    master_key = '1234567890123456';

    // Decode the base64 data so we can separate iv and crypt text.
    var rawData = atob(data);
    // Split by 16 because my IV size
    var iv = rawData.substring(0, 16);
    var crypttext = rawData.substring(16);

    //Parsers
    crypttext = CryptoJS.enc.Latin1.parse(crypttext);
    iv = CryptoJS.enc.Latin1.parse(iv); 
    key = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(master_key);

    // Decrypt
    var plaintextArray = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(
      { ciphertext:  crypttext},
      key,
      {iv: iv, mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC, padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7}
    );

    // Can be Utf8 too
    output_plaintext = CryptoJS.enc.Latin1.stringify(plaintextArray);
    console.log(""plain text : "" + output_plaintext);
}

One of my main problem was keep in mind all kind of encoding and decoding data, for example, I didn't know that the master_key on client side was to be parse with Utf8.

Someone said, there is a problem with installer, but I used .exe installer for x64 system.
Someone said, he changed _warn_unsafe_extractor to different name and problem was solved, but could not find this file.
Now I have a new error (after reinstalling PyCrypto with PIP)

I tried Googling to figure out what to do, but I couldn't find anything useful. How can I install PyCrypto?
EDIT: I also tried several other things like pip install pycrypto and sudo pip3 install pycrypto and they didn't work. @l'L'l helped me get it to work by doing several strange, complex things that I never would have though have myself. They are summarized in the answer below.
","Overview:
The manual build you're trying looks like it might be failing because it's referencing the OS X 10.6 SDK, which you likely don't have, and is outdated for the most part. Also, SDKs are now stored in a completely different location than when the 10.6 SDK was in it's prime.
New SDKs location:
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/

Old SDKs location:
/Developer/SDKs/

Non-existent / outdated SDK:
Since it appears that when trying to build PyCrypto it's referencing the MacOSX10.6.sdk there are several things to consider:

Why does it reference an outdated SDK
Where is the SDK it's referencing set
What should be done to correct the issue

Unless we audit the source code carefully we might not know exactly where the incorrect flags are set, but we can do our best to work with the information we have. From the error we can see that there are several instances where the 10.6 SDK's name pops up:
/usr/bin/clang -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -dynamic -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -fwrapv -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -std=c99 -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -Isrc/ -I/Library

Building from source:
/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7 -c src/MD2.c -o build/temp.macosx-10.6-intel-2.7/src/MD2.o
src/MD2.c:30:10: fatal error: 'string.h' file not found
#include <string.h>
                 ^
1 error generated.
error: command '/usr/bin/clang' failed with exit status 1

Analyzing this we can see that the PyCrypto's MD2.c file is trying to be built using the flag -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk. It might be worth trying pip instead:
Installing with pip:
...
fatal error: 'string.h' file not found #include <string.h>
...

Same error; we should probably find out if the <string.h> header even exists on the system — Let's make a quick test C application to find out:
Testing the C headers:
$ echo ""#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main() { printf(\""TEST\n\""); return 0; }"" > t.c
$ clang t.c -o t
$ ./t
TEST

It's apparent the header does exist because the test worked fine. This tells us that the problem is more likely related directly to the 10.6 SDK (which doesn't seem to exist on the system). 
Symlinking (non-existing) 10.6 SDK to 10.11 SDK:
Since we haven't determined where the SDK is actually getting set we'll go ahead and try to create symlinks so that any reference of the old 10.6 SDK links to the latest SDK (10.11 at this time):
$ cd /Developer/SDKs
$ sudo ln -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk MacOSX10.6.sdk

We can verify the symlink by issuing the following command: 
$ ls -lat
total 8
drwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  102 Feb 21 15:54 .
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   99 Feb 21 15:54 MacOSX10.6.sdk -> /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk
drwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  102 Feb 21 15:52 ..

Now that we've successfully created the symlink let's try installing PyCrypto with pip once more:
$ sudo pip install pycrypto
Collecting pycrypto
  Downloading pycrypto-2.6.1.tar.gz (446kB)
    100% |████████████████████████████████| 446kB 1.2GB/s 
Installing collected packages: pycrypto
  Running setup.py install for pycrypto ... done
Successfully installed pycrypto-2.6.1


No errors! It looks like our problem is solved! Well, almost...

We still need to figure out what is responsible for setting the wrong (10.6) SDK during builds. Let's use the xcrun tool to see what the defaults are set at:
$ xcrun --show-sdk-version
10.11

The system default SDK is set to 10.11, so it must be get set incorrectly to 10.6 by Python, PyCrypto, or some other anomaly we might not have considered. 
UPDATE:
After doing some recon it was discovered that Python 3 appears to be built with the OS X 10.6 SDK. In addition it's also setting the SDK to 10.6 and setting the (outdated) path in numerous places throughout the Python_Framework. There are so many references I won't bother listing them all, although here's an example:
Python_Framework Folder/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/config-3.5m/Makefile:79:CONFIGURE_CFLAGS= -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk

I can only assume the developers were trying to be as backward compatible as possible, however, it's unfortunately breaking forward compatibility in the process.

Notes: 
Installing Python packages with pip can make life much easier in a lot of ways (package management, updating, uninstalling, etc.). For example installing PyCrypto should just be a matter of issuing the command:
$ sudo pip install pycrypto

If you have multiple Python's you can use the version number to install for that Python accordingly:
$ sudo pip3.5 install pycrypto

sudo pip3 uninstall pycrypto

Then install the pycrypto module again using:

If you want to know how long a bytes object or a str is, then you can call len(byteString) or len(string).
I'm assuming that you want to use generate a random IV or key. This can be done in this way:
from Crypto import Random
iv = Random.new().read(16)

This invokes a CSPRNG if the system has enough entropy. You can also use AES.block_size instead of 16.

That was a good start.  My next stopper was figuring out how to get the correct keys.  If you are like me, you use putty and it's keygen utility for key management. And it works great!  But it keeps it's private keys in a file different that what paramiko expects.  But puttygen also provides a solution to this.
Open your *.ppk file in puttygen.
To to Conversions->Export OpenSSH Key
Save your private key as id_rsa  (in .ssh directory, of course). (I am not sure the default name is required.  Feel free to try something else and add a comment.)
Now paramiko will be able to automatically find it.
And here is my Resulting Script.
import sys

client.connect(hostName, username=userName)
stdin, stdout, stderr = client.exec_command('ls')
print ""Standard Error: "", stderr.readlines()

With a proper matching keypair this should now just work. It does for me.  (substitute the proper username of course.)

My problem is, I am not able to decrypt in Java correctly. Despite using the correct key and IV, I still get garbage characters after decryption. I don't have any compile/run-time errors or exceptions in Java so I believe I am using the right parameters for decryption.
Python Encryption Code -

iv = 'RandomInitVector'
raw = 'samplePlainText'
cipher = AES.new(key,AES.MODE_CFB,iv)

Java Decryption Code - 
private static String KEY = ""0123456789012345"";
public static String decrypt(String encrypted_encoded_string) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchPaddingException,
    InvalidKeyException, IllegalBlockSizeException, BadPaddingException {

      String plain_text = """";
      try{
          byte[] encrypted_decoded_bytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode(encrypted_encoded_string);
          String encrypted_decoded_string = new String(encrypted_decoded_bytes);
          String iv_string = encrypted_decoded_string.substring(0,16); //IV is retrieved correctly.

          IvParameterSpec iv = new IvParameterSpec(iv_string.getBytes());
          SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(KEY.getBytes(""UTF-8""), ""AES"");

          Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CFB/NoPadding"");
          cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, skeySpec, iv);

          plain_text = new String(cipher.doFinal(encrypted_decoded_bytes));//Returns garbage characters
          return plain_text;

      }  catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println(""Caught Exception: "" + e.getMessage());
      }

      return plain_text;
 }

Is there anything obvious that I am missing?
","The Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode of operation is a family of modes. It is parametrized by the segment size (or register size). PyCrypto has a default segment size of 8 bit and Java (actually OpenJDK) has a default segment size the same as the block size (128 bit for AES).
If you want CFB-128 in pycrypto, you can use AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv, segment_size=128). If you want CFB-8 in Java, you can use Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CFB8/NoPadding"");.

Now that we have that out the way, you have other problems:

Always specify the character set you're using, because it can change between different JVMs: new String(someBytes, ""UTF-8"") and someString.getBytes(""UTF-8""). When you do, be consistent.
Never use a String to store binary data (new String(encrypted_decoded_bytes);). You can copy the bytes directly: IvParameterSpec iv = new IvParameterSpec(Arrays.copyOf(encrypted_decoded_bytes, 16)); and cipher.doFinal(Arrays.copyOfRange(encrypted_decoded_bytes, 16, encrypted_decoded_bytes.length)).
In Java, you're assuming that the IV is written in front of the ciphertext and then encoded together, but in Python, you're never doing anything with the IV. I guess you posted incomplete code.
It is crucial for CFB mode to use a different IV every time if the key stays the same. If you don't change the IV for every encryption, you will create a multi-time pad which enables an attacker to deduce the plaintext even without knowing the key.

","Partial answer coming along ...

RSA works on numbers. You only get bytes out of it when you serialize those long integers. Since those numbers don't have a fixed size, they are serialized with as much bytes as are necessary, but not more.
An RSA encryption c = me mod n can result in ciphertexts, which are so much smaller than n, that not all the bytes are filled, because leading zeros of the the number don't have to be serialized. 
Sometimes (depending on modulus and plaintext) it may happen that you're writing a 127 byte chunk instead of a 128 byte chunk during encryption, but you're always reading a 128 byte chunk during decryption. That means, you're taking away one byte from the next chunk. When the alignment breaks, you can run into various random behaviors such as a chunk being larger than the modulus and therefore not a valid ciphertext.
There are two ways to solve that:

Always write the length of the ciphertext chunk before it.
Encryption:
data = f.read(readsize)
if not data:
    break
i += 1
enc_data = public_key.encrypt(data, 32)[0]

p.write(chr(len(enc_data)))
p.write(enc_data)

Decryption:
length = f.read(1)
if not length:
    break
data = f.read(ord(length))
print(length, len(data))
j += 1
dec_data = private_key.decrypt(data)
p.write(dec_data[:readsize])

At the end you have to reduce the ciphertext to the original plaintext size, because you're working without PKCS#1 v1.5 padding or OAEP.
Pad the zero bytes that are missing during encryption.
Encryption:
data = f.read(readsize)
if not data:
    break
i += 1
enc_data = public_key.encrypt(data, 32)[0]

while len(enc_data) < writesize:
    enc_data = ""\x00"" + enc_data
p.write(enc_data)

Decryption:
data = f.read(writesize)
if not data:
    break
j += 1
dec_data = private_key.decrypt(data)
p.write(dec_data[:readsize])


Note that readsize = 127 and writesize = 128. Here are the full source codes for both variants.

Now, this is a partial answer, because this still leads to corrupt files, which are also too short, but at least it fixes the OP's error.

","Here's how you can do it :
If you already have the private key you can basically make a private key object with it and then simply extract the public key from it using as :
public_key = private_key.publickey().exportKey('PEM')

assuming that private_key is your private key object. 
In case you do not have this object, one way of obtaining it from the PEM encoded (PKCS#1) private key file (as you have given in your question above) would be like this :
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from base64 import b64decode
pem_key = b'your private key in PEM'
key = b64decode(pem_key)
keyPriv = RSA.importKey(key)
# key now has all the components of the private 
print keyPriv.keydata
modulusN = keyPriv.n
pubExpE = keyPriv.e
priExpD = keyPriv.d
primeP = keyPriv.p
primeQ = keyPriv.q
private_key = RSA.construct((modulusN, pubExpE, priExpD, primeP, primeQ))

and then once you have the private key in the private_key objectdo the :
public_key = private_key.publickey().exportKey('PEM')

The Problem
AES in Javascript
I have an encrypted String which I can decrypt with this this Javascript Implementation of AES 256 CTR Mode

password = ""myPassphrase""
ciphertext = ""bQJdJ1F2Y0+uILADqEv+/SCDV1jAb7jwUBWk""
origtext = Aes.Ctr.decrypt(ciphertext, password, 256);
alert(origtext)

This decrypts my string and the alert box with This is a test Text pops up.
AES with PyCrypto
Now I want to decrypt this string with python and PyCrypto
password = 'myPassphrase'
ciphertext = ""bQJdJ1F2Y0+uILADqEv+/SCDV1jAb7jwUBWk""
ctr = Counter.new(nbits=128)
encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr)
origtext = encryptor.decrypt(base64.b64decode(ciphertext))
print origtext

This code does not run. I get an ValueError: AES key must be either 16, 24, or 32 bytes long. When I recognized, that I have to do more in PyCrypto then just call a decrypt method, I started to investigate end try to figure out what I have to do.
Investigation
The basic things I figured out first, were:

AES 256 Bit (?). But AES standard is 128 bit. Does increasing the passphrase to 32 Byte is enough?
Counter Mode. Easily to set in PyCrypto with AES.MODE_CTR. But I have to specify a counter() Method. So I used the basic binary Counter provided by PyCrypto. Is this compatible with the Javascript Implementation? I can't figure out what they are doing.
The string is base64 encoded. Not a big problem.
Padding in general. Both passphrase and the encrypted string.

For the passphrase they do this:
for (var i=0; i<nBytes; i++) {
    pwBytes[i] = isNaN(password.charCodeAt(i)) ? 0 : password.charCodeAt(i);
}

Then I did this in python
l = 32
key = key + (chr(0)*(l-len(key)%l))

But this did not help. I still get a weird string ?
A???B??d9=  ,?h????' with the following code
l = 32
key = 'myPassphrase'
key = key + (chr(0)*(l-len(key)%l))
ciphertext = ""bQJdJ1F2Y0+uILADqEv+/SCDV1jAb7jwUBWk""
ctr = Counter.new(nbits=128)
encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr)
origtext = encryptor.decrypt(base64.b64decode(ciphertext))
print origtext

Then I read more about the Javascript Implementation and it says

[...] In this implementation, the initial block holds the nonce in the first 8 bytes, and the block count in the second 8 bytes. [...]

I think this could be the key to the solution. So I tested what happens when I encrypt an empty string in Javascript:
origtext = """"
var ciphertext =Aes.Ctr.encrypt(origtext, password, 256);
alert(ciphertext)

The alert box shows /gEKb+N3Y08= (12 characters). But why 12? Shouldn't it be 8+8 = 16Bytes? Well anyway, I tried a bruteforce method on the python decryption by testing the decryption with for i in xrange(0,20): and ciphertext[i:] or base64.b64decode(ciphertext)[i:]. I know this is a very embarrassing try, but I got more and more desperate. And it didn't work either.
The future prospects are also to implement the encryption in the same way.
additional information
The encrypted string was not originally encrypted with this Javascript implementation, It's from another source. I just recognized, that the Javascript code does the right thing. So I affirm that this kind of implementation is something like a ""standard"".
The question
What can I do, that the encryption and decryption from a string with PyCrypto is the same like in the Javascript implementation, so that I can exchange data between Javascript and Python? 
I also would switch to another crypto library in python, if you can suggest another one.
Furthermore I'm happy with any kind of tips and feedback.
And I think, all comes down to How can I include the nonce and block count to the encrypted string? and How can I extract this information for decryption?
","We are still dealing with a bunch of questions here.
How can I extract the nonce and the counter for decryption?
This is easy. In the Javascript implementation (which does not follow a particular
standard in this respect) the 8-byte nonce is prepended to the encrypted result.
In Python, you extract it with:
import base64
from_js_bin = base64.decode(from_js)
nonce = from_js_bin[:8]
ciphertext = from_js_bin[8:]

Where from_js is a binary string you received.
The counter cannot be extracted because the JS implementation does not transmit it.
However, the initial value is (as typically happens) 0.
How can I use the nonce and counter to decrypt the string in Python?
First, it must be established how nonce and counter are combined to get the counter block.
It seems that the JS implementation follows the NIST 800-38A standard, where the
left half is the nonce, and the right half is the counter. More precisely, the counter
is in big endian format (LSB is the rightmost byte). This is also what Wikipedia shows:
.
Unfortunately, CTR mode is poorly documented in PyCrypto (a well-known problem).
Basically, the counter parameter must be a callable object that returns
the correct 16-byte (for AES) counter block, for each subsequent call.
Crypto.Util.Counter does that, but in an obscure way.
It is there only for performance purposes though. You can easily implement it yourself like this:
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import struct

class MyCounter:

  def __init__(self, nonce):
    """"""Initialize the counter object.

    @nonce      An 8 byte binary string.
    """"""
    assert(len(nonce)==8)
    self.nonce = nonce
    self.cnt = 0

  def __call__(self):
    """"""Return the next 16 byte counter, as binary string.""""""
    righthalf = struct.pack('>Q',self.cnt)
    self.cnt += 1
    return self.nonce + righthalf

cipher_ctr = AES.new(key, mode=AES.MODE_CTR, counter=MyCounter(nonce))
plaintext = cipher_ctr.decrypt(ciphertext)

How long is the key for AES?
The key length for AES-128 is 16 bytes.
The key length for AES-192 is 24 bytes.
The key length for AES-256 is 32 bytes.
Each algorithm is different, but much of the implementation is shared.
In all cases, the algorithm operate on 16 byte blocks of data.
For simplicity, stick to AES-128 (nBits=128).
Will your code work?
I have the feeling it won't, because the way you compute the AES key seems incorrect.
The JS code encodes the password in UTF-8 and encrypts it with itself.
The result is the actual key material. It is 16 byte long, so for AES-192 and -256, the implementation copies part of it at the back. Additionally, the plaintext is also UTF-8 encoded before encryption.
In general, I suggest you follow this approach:

Make your JS implementation reproducible (right now encryption depends on the current time, which changes quite often ;-) ).
Print the value of the keys and data at each step (or use a debugger).
Try to reproduce the same algorithm in Python, and print the values too.
Investigate where they start to differ.

Once you have duplicated the encryption algorithm in Python, the decryption one should be easy.

"5938664","How to generate the PEM serialization for the public RSA/DSA key","Using PyCrypto I was able to generate the public and private PEM serialization for a RSA key, but in PyCrypto the DSA class has no exportKey() method.
Trying PyOpenSSL I was able to generate the private PEM serialization for RSA and DSA keys, bu there is no crypto.dump_publickey method in PyOpenSSL.
I am looking for suggestion of how to generate the PEM serialization for RSA and DSA keys.
Many thanks!
PS: meanwhile I have changed the PyOpenSSL code to also export an dump_privatekey method for crypto API. PyOpenSSL bug and patch can be found at: https://bugs.launchpad.net/pyopenssl/+bug/780089

I was already using Twisted.conch so I solved this problem by manually generating a DSA/RSA key using PyCrypto and then initializing a twisted.conch.ssh.key.Key using this key. The Key class from Conch provides a toString method for string serialization.
","It is not clear what you are doing this for, but if all you want is an openssl-compatible DSA private key, you should just follow the openssl dsa(1) manual page:

The DER option with a private key uses
  an ASN1 DER encoded form of an ASN .1
  SEQUENCE consisting of the values of
  version (currently zero), p, q, g, the
  public and private key components
  respectively as ASN .1 INTEGERs.

This is an example how to export/import DSA private keys in openssl format:
from Crypto.PublicKey import DSA
from Crypto.Util import asn1

key = DSA.generate(1024)

# export

seq = asn1.DerSequence()
seq[:] = [ 0, key.p, key.q, key.g, key.y, key.x ]

exported_key = ""-----BEGIN DSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n%s-----END DSA PRIVATE KEY-----"" % seq.encode().encode(""base64"")

print exported_key

# import

seq2 = asn1.DerSequence()
data = ""\n"".join(exported_key.strip().split(""\n"")[1:-1]).decode(""base64"")
seq2.decode(data)
p, q, g, y, x = seq2[1:]

key2 = DSA.construct((y, g, p, q, x))

assert key == key2

","It's always worth reading the documentation first. I'll quote from pycrypto's README:

Red Hat users often run into this because they don't have the
  python2-devel RPM installed. The fix is to simply install the

edit I'll add, don't get your software from a website like softpedia (especially not crypto software!). Get it from the pycrypto website and verify the signature and file hash.

","First of all, that Java example code is very bad. It outputs the ciphertext as an integer, whereas ciphertext should remain a binary string. The reason is that an integer can be represented in an infinite number of binary encodings. For instance, the number one can be '0x01' (1 byte), '0x0001' (2 bytes), and so forth. When you are dealing with cryptographic functions, you must be extremely precise with the representation.
Additionally, the example uses the default values of the javax.crypto API, which are not described anywhere. So it is really trial and error.
For the solution, you must know how to convert negative integers to hex strings in Python. In this case, you don't need a hex string, but its byte representation. The concept is the same though. I use PyCrypto's long_to_bytes to convert a positive integer (of arbitrary length) to a byte string.
from Crypto.Cipher import Blowfish
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes

def tobytestring(val, nbits):
    """"""Convert an integer (val, even negative) to its byte string representation.
    Parameter nbits is the length of the desired byte string (in bits).
    """"""
    return long_to_bytes((val + (1 << nbits)) % (1 << nbits), nbits/8)

key = b'jaas is the way'
c1  = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_ECB)

fromjava = b""-27038292d345798947e2852756afcf0a""
# We don't know the real length of the ciphertext, assume it is 16 bytes
ciphertext = tobytestring(int(fromjava, 16), 16*8)
print c1.decrypt(ciphertext)

The output is:
'testpython\x06\x06\x06\x06\x06\x06'

From that you see that javax.crypto also adds PKCS#5 padding, which you need to remove by yourself. That is trivial to do though.
However, the real solution to your problem is to do Java encryption in a better way. The Python code will be greatly simplified.

However, I can't for the life of me, figure out how to decrypt the string '27038292d345798947e2852756afcf0a' using pycrypto in python.  My understanding is that the Java code is using Blowfish, and the phrase 'jaas is the way' as the key for the cipher.  But I can't make any sense of how to do this in python.  The following results in mostly unprintable garbage:
import Crypto
from Crypto.Cipher import Blowfish
from base64 import b64encode, b64decode

bs        = Blowfish.block_size
key       = 'jaas is the way'
plaintext = b'27038292d345798947e2852756afcf0a'
iv        = '\0' * 8

c1 = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_ECB)
c2 = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_CBC, iv)
c3 = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_CFB, iv)
c4 = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_OFB, iv)

msg1 = c1.decrypt(plaintext)
msg2 = c2.decrypt(plaintext)
msg3 = c3.decrypt(plaintext)
msg4 = c4.decrypt(plaintext)

print ""msg1 = %s\n"" % msg1
print ""msg2 = %s\n"" % msg2 
print ""msg3 = %s\n"" % msg3 
print ""msg4 = %s\n"" % msg4 

What am I missing ?
thanks.
","This helps me
private byte[] encrypt(String key, String plainText) throws GeneralSecurityException {

    SecretKey secret_key = new SecretKeySpec(key.getBytes(), ALGORITM);

    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(ALGORITM);
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secret_key);

","Note that I am not an expert in crypto either. That said, I took a quick look at the PyCrypto code on github and at their mailing list. One of the things that gives me confidence is that there is good, expert contributions to the code base. The developers acknowledge insecurities and work to correct them.
If you have a specific use case that you need to be implemented securely, look at their code and ask on their list. Since they seem to leverage C/C++ libraries to do the work in many cases, you can check out the reputation of the base libraries directly.

","It depends.
Some parts of PyCrypto are really good.  For example, the API for Crypto.Random (introduced in PyCrypto 2.1) was designed to be pretty foolproof, and the underlying algorithm it uses (Fortuna) was also designed to be pretty foolproof.
Other parts are just implementations of low-level crypto primitives, so it works, but you have to know what you are doing to use them correctly.  For example, Crypto.PublicKey.RSA doesn't implement the full RSA PKCS#1 standard (which is what most people think about when they talk about ""RSA"").  It only implements the basic RSA primitive (m^e mod n and c^d mod n), and you still have to provide your own PKCS#1 implementation.
The best way to ensure that PyCrypto is encrypting your data correctly (without reading the source code, which I encourage everyone to do) is to use a standard protocol and/or message format, and test that your code interoperates with other implementations.  If you're making up your own message format (which you probably shouldn't do anyway), then you need to be very careful to ensure that PyCrypto is actually doing everything that you think it's doing.
Disclaimer: I'm the current PyCrypto maintainer, so my opinions shouldn't be considered an independent review.
Update: PyCrypto v2.5 and later now include proper RSA PKCS#1 encryption and signature implementations.  See the API documentation for Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEP and Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_PSS for details.

","As Pycrypto uses the encode method, it requires a s# read-only buffer. The buffer should not be resizeable, which isn't the case of bytearray. Such a buffer can be built by using the bytes function. Python 2 str was already immutable and so it was aceptable. The new line should be :

Thanks a lot in advance.. :)
","Looking at the documentation, it seems that it's up to you, the library user, to pad the data yourself. The documentation states that the block size for AES is always 16 bytes, so you need to pad the data to a multiple of 16 bytes.
How the padding is done depends on the type of the data. For strings the best approach is probably to encode the string to a specific encoding and then take the length of that encoding. That way you're not relying on all characters being represented by an 8-bit codepoint:
plaintext = data.encode('utf-8')
l = len(plaintext)
ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(plaintext + ((16 - len%16) * PADDING_BYTE))

A similar approach will work when you're data is an array of bytes.
0 should work fine as the PADDING_BYTE, but you need to take care to remove the padding when you're decrypting the data. It might be worth while including the length of the data in the ciphertext, e.g. prepend the length of the data to the plaintext before encryption, but then you need to jump through some hoops to make sure the padding is generated correctly.
Edit: oh yes, just like the RFC GregS links to mentions, the standard way of handling the length problem is the use the length of the padding as the padding byte. I.e. if you need 6 bytes of padding the padding byte is 0x06.

Python version 3.6.x

","Every time you generate with Pycryptodome an AES cipher object in CBC mode, a random IV is created and used. It can be accessed as the attribute called iv (for instance cipher.iv).
The unique (and unpredictable) IV achieves the goal of randomizing the output even if the same message is getting encrypted multiple times (with the same key), which is a piece of information an attacker can often take advantage of.
You don't show the PHP code, but if its output does NOT change every time, it means that the IV is fixed and the code has a security vulnerability.

","Python's print will always append a newline character, which is the extra byte you see.
As far as I know there is no clean way of avoiding that and print signature, won't work either.
The alternative is to use the lower level sys.stdout.write(signature).

"7842770","How to use pip install where one requirement has dependency on version on gcc-4.5","I am installing an egg packaged for pip, inside my virtualenv, under Python 2.7.2.
The egg has 16 requirements, one of which (pycryptopp 0.5.29) is known to fail with gcc-4.6 and hence must be compiled with 4.5. The system has both gcc-4.6 (default) and gcc-4.5 installed.
How do I configure/hack pip install to build this package specially? (or do I just temporarily kludge the link /usr/bin/gcc while installing this package)
Do I need to clean up the existing (virtualenv)/build directory where it broke, and if so how?
(I already read the pip documentation and searched SO + SU)
","(I retitled the question from ""How to use pip install where one requirement must be compiled with gcc-4.5?"")
1) The correct method is to build with ""--disable-embedded-cryptopp"" which links to libcryptopp. Some people report runtime issue but It Works For Me.
pip install --install-option=""--disable-embedded-cryptopp"" pycryptopp

2.) A truly ugly workaround which I used (and which ulif helpfully points out can be obviated by using CC=.. ) is to invoke pip install specifically for the problem package, and temporarily kludge the link to gcc.
pushd /usr/bin; sudo rm gcc-4.6; ln -s gcc-4.5 gcc; popd;
pip install pycryptopp
pushd /usr/bin; sudo rm gcc-4.5; ln -s gcc-4.6 gcc; popd;

Further reasons this is bad: it requires root access and messing with the link to gcc binary. It certainly can't be Makefile'd.

","No need to fiddle around with symlinks here. On most Linux systems you can set the compiler to use with the CC env var. In case of pycryptopp and pip the following might help:
$ CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.5 pip install pycryptopp

given that you have GCC 4.5 installed in that location. This worked fine for me on Ubuntu 11.10 (oneiric) with packages gcc-4.5 and g++-4.5 installed.

"16203619","Decrypting data in Python that was encrypted in 3DES by Java","I'm trying to decrypt data using PyCrypto. The data was encoded in Java with the javax.crypto package. The encryption is Triple DES (referred to as ""DESede"" in Java). As far as I can tell, default settings are used for everything. However, when I go to decrypt the data in Python there is always a problem with the data.
Here's the Java code that does encrypting/decrypting:
import sun.misc.BASE64Decoder;
import sun.misc.BASE64Encoder;

import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory;
import javax.crypto.spec.DESedeKeySpec;
import java.security.spec.KeySpec;

public final class Encrypter
{
    public static final String DESEDE_ENCRYPTION = ""DESede"";

    private KeySpec keySpec;
    private SecretKeyFactory keyFactory;
    private Cipher cipher;

    private static final String UNICODE_FORMAT = ""UTF8"";

    public Encrypter(String encryptionKey)
        throws Exception
    {
        byte[] keyAsBytes = encryptionKey.getBytes(UNICODE_FORMAT);
        keySpec = new DESedeKeySpec(keyAsBytes);
        keyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(DESEDE_ENCRYPTION);
        cipher = Cipher.getInstance(DESEDE_ENCRYPTION);
    }

    public String encryptString(String unencryptedString)
    {
        SecretKey key = keyFactory.generateSecret(keySpec);
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
        byte[] cleartext = unencryptedString.getBytes(UNICODE_FORMAT);
        byte[] ciphertext = cipher.doFinal(cleartext);

        BASE64Encoder base64encoder = new BASE64Encoder();
        return base64encoder.encode(ciphertext);
    }

    public String decryptString(String encryptedString)
    {
        SecretKey key = keyFactory.generateSecret(keySpec);
        cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key);
        BASE64Decoder base64decoder = new BASE64Decoder();
        byte[] ciphertext = base64decoder.decodeBuffer(encryptedString);
        byte[] cleartext = cipher.doFinal(ciphertext);

        return bytesToString(cleartext);
    }

    private static String bytesToString(byte[] bytes)
    {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (byte aByte : bytes)
        {
            sb.append((char) aByte);
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}

But when I take one of the base64-encoded strings that was produced by this code, I can't decode it. Here's an example of some of the python code I've tried:
from Crypto.Cipher import DES3
import array

key = <value of the key, as a hex string>
encryptedvalue = <the value that's encrypted, as a string>
keyarray = array.array('B', key.decode(""hex""))
des = DES3.new(keyarray)
value = des.decrypt(encryptedvalue.decode('base64'))

value.decode('utf-8') # Gives me an error

The errors I've gotten have looked along the lines of
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xa7 in position 6: invalid start byte

Which means that somewhere along the way, I haven't gotten something set up correctly. I've been working on this for a few hours, even going so far as trying to look into the SunJCE source code, which implements DESede, to see what defaults they use, but to no avail. I'm going to be using this as part of a script that runs automatically, so I'd really rather not have to use Java to do my decryption. Does anyone know what I need to do to decrypt my data correctly?
","All I had to do to make it work was to change this line
keyarray = array.array('B', key.decode(""hex""))

to this:
keyarray = array.array('B', key.encode(""utf-8""))

This matches the way that java was encoding the key, allowing me to have the correct encryption key.

If you've come here hoping to learn something from this question, here's some general advice:

Double-check your assumptions: The key string was a hex string, so I assumed it was being used as such.
Make sure you know what your assumptions are: I didn't consciously think about how I was making an assumption about how the key was used. This tends to be a very frequent problem in both programming and life in general.
Check all the values along the way (especially when you have an Oracle): Looking at the values in the byte arrays was what led me to realizing my problem.

I'm getting similar syntax errors when I try to install pycrypto as well. I tried this answer but in vain. I tried setting up for python 2.6 and 2.7 environments using setuptools-0.6c11-py2.6.egg and setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg but getting the same output.
I searched a lot online but cant find solution for this.
EDIT: I'm on OSX 10.7 on macbook pro 2010, and have XCode 4 and 3 installed
I'd args with replaced with the latest version while trying the commands in the link above.
python setup.py build --static-deps --libxml2-version=2.7.8  --libxslt-version=1.1.26 
sudo python setup.py install

I read on someother post and tried this as well
STATIC_DEPS=true sudo easy_install --allow-hosts=lxml.de,*.python.org lxml

Solution:
As @jdi suggested I did the following
$ brew install --use-llvm libxml2
$ brew install --use-llvm libxslt

Installed gcc from link, since I was still facing issues with option 1 and 2 suggested 
Then, either this
$ export ARCHFLAGS=""-arch i386 -arch x86_64""
$ /usr/bin/python2.6 setup.py build
$ sudo /usr/bin/python2.6 setup.py install

Or this, will work
$ sudo env ARCHFLAGS=""-arch i386 -arch x86_64"" easy_install-2.6 lxml

Same worked for pycrypto as well  
","This right here is an indication that you are building it improperly: /Developer/usr/bin/../lib/gcc/powerpc-apple-darwin10, unless of course you are on an old powerpc machine. 
Check the version of OSX you are running, and the commands you are using to build lxml. Chances are you might need to set export ARCHFLAGS=""-arch i386 -arch x86_64"" in your shell before building, in order to avoid it building with ppc. Not sure why you are getting an old arch.
Also, make sure you have the latest Xcode installed. And, if you are following that link you posted, word for word, make sure you are using the most recent versions of those packages and not the literal versions as that link is 3 years old.
If all else fails, install homebrew and install it through that package manager.

In this particular scenario, I am encrypting data on the client side with Crypto-JS and decrypting it back on a python server with PyCrypto.
encrypt.js:
  var password = 'BJhtfRjKnTDTtPXUBnErKDxfkiMCOLyP';
  var data = 'mytext';

  var masterKey = CryptoJS.SHA256(password).toString();

  // Derive keys for AES and HMAC
  var length = masterKey.toString().length / 2
  var encryptionKey = masterKey.substr(0, length);
  var hmacKey = masterKey.substr(length);

  var iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(64/8);

  var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(
    data,
    encryptionKey,
    {
      iv: iv,
      mode: CryptoJS.mode.CFB
    }
  );

  var concat = iv + encrypted;

  // Calculate HMAC using iv and cipher text
  var hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(concat, hmacKey);

  // Put it all together
  var registrationKey = iv + encrypted + hash;

  // Encode in Base64
  var basemessage = btoa(registrationKey);

decrypt.py:
class AESCipher:
    def __init__(self, key):
        key_hash = SHA256.new(key).hexdigest()
        # Derive keys
        encryption_key = key_hash[:len(key_hash)/2]
        self.key = encryption_key            
        self.hmac_key = key_hash[len(key_hash)/2:]


    def verify_hmac(self, input_cipher, hmac_key):
        # Calculate hash using inputted key
        new_hash = HMAC.new(hmac_key, digestmod=SHA256)
        new_hash.update(input_cipher)
        digest = new_hash.hexdigest()

        # Calculate hash using derived key from local password
        local_hash = HMAC.new(self.hmac_key, digestmod=SHA256)
        local_hash.update(input_cipher)
        local_digest = local_hash.hexdigest()

        return True if digest == local_digest else False


    def decrypt(self, enc):
        enc = base64.b64decode(enc)
        iv = enc[:16]
        hmac = enc[60:]
        cipher_text = enc[16:60]

        # Verify HMAC using concatenation of iv + cipher like in js
        verified_hmac = self.verify_hmac((iv+cipher_text), self.hmac_key)

        if verified_hmac:
            cipher = AES.new(self.key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
            return cipher.decrypt(cipher_text)


password = 'BJhtfRjKnTDTtPXUBnErKDxfkiMCOLyP'

input = 'long base64 registrationKey...'

cipher = AESCipher(password)
decrypted = cipher.decrypt(input)

I'm successful in re-calculating the HMAC but when I try and then decrypt the cipher I get something that seems encrypted with �'s in the result.
I was getting errors about input length of cipher text but when I switched to CFB mode that fixed it so I don't think it's a padding issue.
","There are many problems with your code.
Client (JavaScript):

AES has a block size of 128 bit and CFB mode expects a full block for the IV. Use
var iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);

The iv and hash variables are WordArray objects, but encrypted is not. When you force them to be converted to strings by concatenating them (+), iv and hash are Hex-encoded, but encrypted is formatted in an OpenSSL compatible format and Base64-encoded. You need to access the ciphertext property to get the encrypted WordArray:
var concat = iv + encrypted.ciphertext;

and
var registrationKey = iv + encrypted.ciphertext + hash;

registrationKey is hex-encoded. There is no need to encode it again with Base64 and bloat it even more:
var basemessage = registrationKey;

If you want to convert the hex encoded registrationKey to base64 encoding, use:
var basemessage = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(registrationKey).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);

concat is a hex-encoded string of the IV and ciphertext, because you forced the stringification by ""adding"" (+) iv and encrypted. The HmacSHA256() function takes either a WordArray object or a string. When you pass a string in, as you do, it will assume that the data is UTF-8 encoded and try to decode it as UTF-8. You need to parse the data yourself into a WordArray:
var hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(concat), hmacKey);

The CryptoJS.AES.encrypt() and CryptoJS.HmacSHA256() expect the key either as a WordArray object or as a string. As before, if the key is supplied as a string, a UTF-8 encoding is assumed which is not the case here. You better parse the strings into WordArrays yourself:
var encryptionKey = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(masterKey.substr(0, length));
var hmacKey = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(masterKey.substr(length));


Server (Python):

You're not verifying anything in verify_hmac(). You hash the same data with the same key twice. What you need to do is hash the IV+ciphertext and compare the result with the hash (called tag or HMAC-tag) that you slice off the full ciphertext.
def verify_hmac(self, input_cipher, mac):
    # Calculate hash using derived key from local password
    local_hash = HMAC.new(self.hmac_key, digestmod=SHA256)
    local_hash.update(input_cipher)
    local_digest = local_hash.digest()

    return mac == local_digest

And later in decrypt():
verified_hmac = self.verify_hmac((iv+cipher_text), hmac)

You need to correctly slice off the MAC. The 60 that is hardcoded is a bad idea. Since you're using SHA-256 the MAC is 32 bytes long, so you do this
hmac = enc[-32:]
cipher_text = enc[16:-32]

The CFB mode is actually a set of similar modes. The actual mode is determined by the segment size. CryptoJS only supports segments of 128 bit. So you need tell pycrypto to use the same mode as in CryptoJS:
cipher = AES.new(self.key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv, segment_size=128)

If you want to use CFB mode with a segment size of 8 bit (default of pycrypto), you can use a modified version of CFB in CryptoJS from my project: Extension for CryptoJS

Full client code:
var password = 'BJhtfRjKnTDTtPXUBnErKDxfkiMCOLyP';
var data = 'mytext';

var masterKey = CryptoJS.SHA256(password).toString();
var length = masterKey.length / 2
var encryptionKey = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(masterKey.substr(0, length));
var hmacKey = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(masterKey.substr(length));

var iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);

var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(
    data,
    encryptionKey,
    {
      iv: iv,
      mode: CryptoJS.mode.CFB
    }
);

var concat = iv + encrypted.ciphertext; 
var hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(concat), hmacKey);

","By default, Crypto++ employs PKCS5 padding to the plaintext strings. This adds padding to the end of the string to make sure the string is a multiple of the block size which, for AES, is 16 bytes. If the plaintext is already a multiple of 16, Crypto++ adds another 16 bytes of padding to the plaintext and then encrypts the whole thing. PyCrypto doesn't add this extra padding, leaving it up to the user to ensure the correct block size. Note that when you decrypt the Crypto++-encrypted cipher text, the extra padding is automatically removed.

","Since lambda runs under the hood on amazon linux instances, you basically need to:

spin up an amazon linux ec2 instance
create a virtualenv and pip install all packages you need
scp the files down to wherever your local deployment package lives

This all happens due to issues with how pip install does things differently depending on whether you're on linux or mac (and I'm assuming windows as well). 
here's a startup script to get the ec2 instance up to speed afaik
#!/bin/bash

sudo yum upgrade -y
sudo yum group install -y ""Development tools""

sudo yum install -y \
    python27 \
    libffi libffi-devel \
    openssl openssl-devel

The paramiko package will be in /path/to/venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/paramiko and the cryptography stuff will be in path/to/venv/lib64/python2.7/cryptography.
I've been using a combination of pip install on my local mac and doing this when a package doesn't work (like for paramiko and psycopg2), and there are a few other helpful packages that people have pre-compiled and put up on github elsewhere specifically for lambda.

","Here is a version with CryptoJS 3.1.2. Always beware of the following things (use the same in both languages):

Mode of operation (CBC in this case)
Padding (Zero Padding in this case; better use PKCS#7 padding)
Key (the same derivation function or clear key)
Encoding (same encoding for key, plaintext, ciphertext, ...)
IV (generated during encryption, passed for decryption)

If a string is passed as the key argument to the CryptoJS encrypt() function, the string is used to derive the actual key to be used for encryption. If you wish to use a key (valid sizes are 16, 24 and 32 byte), then you need to pass it as a WordArray.
The result of the CryptoJS encryption is an OpenSSL formatted ciphertext string. To get the actual ciphertext from it, you need to access the ciphertext property on it.
The IV must be random for each encryption so that it is semantically secure. That way attackers cannot say whether the same plaintext that was encrypted multiple times is actually the same plaintext when only looking at the ciphertext.
Below is an example that I have made.
JavaScript:
var key = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse('1234567890123456');

function encrypt(msgString, key) {
    // msgString is expected to be Utf8 encoded
    var iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(16);
    var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(msgString, key, {
        iv: iv
    });
    return iv.concat(encrypted.ciphertext).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);
}

function decrypt(ciphertextStr, key) {
    var ciphertext = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(ciphertextStr);

    // split IV and ciphertext
    var iv = ciphertext.clone();
    iv.sigBytes = 16;
    iv.clamp();
    ciphertext.words.splice(0, 4); // delete 4 words = 16 bytes
    ciphertext.sigBytes -= 16;

    // decryption
    var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt({ciphertext: ciphertext}, key, {
        iv: iv
    });
    return decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
}

Python code:
BLOCK_SIZE = 16
key = b""1234567890123456""

def pad(data):
    length = BLOCK_SIZE - (len(data) % BLOCK_SIZE)
    return data + chr(length)*length

def unpad(data):
    return data[:-ord(data[-1])]

def encrypt(message, passphrase):
    IV = Random.new().read(BLOCK_SIZE)
    aes = AES.new(passphrase, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)
    return base64.b64encode(IV + aes.encrypt(pad(message)))

def decrypt(encrypted, passphrase):
    encrypted = base64.b64decode(encrypted)
    IV = encrypted[:BLOCK_SIZE]
    aes = AES.new(passphrase, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)
    return unpad(aes.decrypt(encrypted[BLOCK_SIZE:]))


Other considerations:
It seems that you want to use a passphrase as a key. Passphrases are usually human readable, but keys are not. You can derive a key from a passphrase with functions such as PBKDF2, bcrypt or scrypt.
The code above is not fully secure, because it lacks authentication. Unauthenticated ciphertexts may lead to viable attacks and unnoticed data manipulation. Usually the an encrypt-then-MAC scheme is employed with a good MAC function such as HMAC-SHA256.

to start with, you need python-dev package:
sudo apt-get install python-dev

Then install pycrypto. Here is the package download, it is better to choose the last release, build it an install it:

go to pycrypto extraction dir
python setup.py build
python setup.py install

Do the same thing for ecdsa, you can download it from here.

"5116760","RSA encryption in .NET, decryption in python","I'm trying to encrypt a short message using RSA algorithm in C# and decrypt the message using a python skript.
I'd like to use the .NET classes on the C# side and pycrypto on python side. I've managed both sides to use the same key (which was not even trivial since .NET doesn't support the standard PEM/DER format directly). Encryption/decryption works on both sides independently.
I'm using PKCS#1 padding on the C# side (setting the fOAEP parameter of RSACryptoServiceProvider.Encrypt to false), so I'd expect that after decrypting the block in python I should see some kind of clear text (i.e. my ""message"" together with padding bytes)
But all I see is garbage :(.
Are there any caveats/pitfalls I'm not aware of on either side? I'm kind of out of ideas ...
Thx
Martin
Sample code
C# / Encryption
Console.Write(""Input string:"");
var s = Console.ReadLine();
var b = Encoding.Default.GetBytes(s);
var encrypted = rsa.Encrypt(b, false);
using (var file = new FileStream(filename, FileMode.Create)) {
  file.Write(encrypted, 0, encrypted.Length);
  file.Flush();
  file.Close();
}

Python / Decryption
f = open(filename, ""rb"")
msg = f.read()
f.close()
decrypted = rsa.decrypt(msg)
print ""Decrypted message:""
print_hex(decrypted)

For Key transfer I'm using the ToXmlString() method of RSACryptoServiceProvider. The resulting XML is parsed in python and the pycrypto-RSA object is initialized with
r = Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.construct((modulus, exponent, d, p, q))

where modulus, exponent, d, p and q are the respective fields of the .NET-RSAParameters structure. (as I've mentioned, I can encrypt/decrypt a message using this key in python, also p*q yields modulus, so I think the key import is working correctly ...)
","Ok, it was my fault, I just didn't look at the results: The leading zero (from PKCS#1 padding) is not part of the python result string, which looks (in hex) like:
02 a2 16 4e 51 45 aa 8d 
94 b0 de 64 4d 4c 4c bd 
0b 01 b8 d2 de dc ed 23 
0b 25 c2 11 6c 0a 0b 1f 
4f 19 d0 33 18 db e0 81 
25 33 f6 e3 70 8d 97 d2 
c7 ef 32 ef 27 3c c0 ac 
47 68 c0 5b 7b 6d 0d ba 
44 da cb bf e8 71 75 d3 
2f 9a b1 97 6b 70 4f ff

af 76 55 bc 5d e9 41 99 
00 4d 61 72 74 69 6e 

So, 02 at the beginning points to random padding (somehow I was expecting 0xff padding...). The last 6 bytes (after the zero) are exactly the ""Message"" I was expecting, but a normal print didn't show them just because of the zero byte...

","By ""same key"" you mean ""the other key"", right? RSA gives you a keypair, if you encrypt with one you decrypt with the other ...
Other than that, it sounds like a encoding problem. Try storing the data as binary or encode the string with your databases collation.
Basically encryption gives you bytes but you store them as a string (encoded bytes).

","you just need to store the private key, because you always can generate the public key from the private one.
>>> from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
>>> RSAkey = RSA.generate(1024)

The public key can be exported with
>>> RSAkey.publickey().exportKey()

To save the private key you might want to convert it to a text with the exportKey() method and store it in a django-TextField:
>>> RSAkey.exportKey()
'-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMI...-----END'

Converting the text back to a RSA key object is easy too:
>>> RSA.importKey('-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY--- ....')

gets you a RSAobj like the one I generated at first.
You might also try the ""hard way"" by creating your own model field class, if you intend to use the functionality in other areas as well. See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/howto/custom-model-fields/

crypto-js (a javascript crypto library) 
and pycrypto (a python crypto library)

On the python server side I encrypt a string with an iv and a passphrase and send the iv with the encrypted text base64 encoded to the javascript client side. Then I want to decrypt the string with the passphrase the user can enter.
python - server
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto import Random

iv = Random.get_random_bytes(16)
key = ""1234567812345678""
aes = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
encrypted_text = base64.b64encode(aes.encrypt(""this is a test..""))
iv = base64.b64encode(iv)
# send iv, encrypted_text to client

javascript - client
// <script type=""text/javascript"" 
        src=""http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/files/2.5.3-crypto-sha1-hmac-pbkdf2-blockmodes-aes.js"">
   </script>
// text, and iv is base64encoded from the python script
// key is a string from an <input type='text'>
decrypted = Crypto.AES.decrypt(text, key, {iv: iv, mode: new Crypto.mode.CFB});

With this example I get a javascript error
Uncaught URIError: URI malformed

But this is just one example - I tried every constellation of base64 encodings/decodings I could think of. I also tried to changed the Mode. But these are all random tests and I want to understand what I really have to do. 

What encoding does the crypt-js want? 
Which mode should I chose?
Is there something I should change on the python server side?
what is about padding? Could there be the fault?
any other javascript libraries you can recommend?

thank you very much and kind reagards,
samuirai
","Before You encode to base64 You must sum iv and encrypted_text:
encrypted_text = base64.b64encode(iv + aes.encrypt(""this is a test..""))

From the official documentation (https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/doc/) :
As an example, encryption can be done as follows:
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto import Random

key = b'Sixteen byte key'
iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
msg = iv + cipher.encrypt(b'Attack at dawn')

"22395478","What is the difference between Pycrypto's Random.get_random_bytes and a simple random byte generator?","I came across this method in Pycrypto, which is used to generate random bytes:
from Crypto import Random
Random.get_random_bytes(5)

I was wondering how this method is different from a simple generator like the following:
import random
def get_random_bytes(N):
    ASCII = """".join(chr(x) for x in range(255))
    return """".join(random.choice(ASCII) for _ in range(n))

Note: my intuition is that the Pycrypto method is more cryptographically ""sound"". Looking at random's documentation, it says that it is based on a generator with a period of 2**19937-1. Looking at Random.get_random_bytes, it states that it is capable of generating cryptographically-strong bytes. What does that mean?
Of course, I wish to use the library implementation, instead of my own. I just want to understand the cryptography concepts behind it.
","For a cryptographically secure random number generator any sequence of output provides you no information as for what the next output will be.
random is based on the Mersenne Twister. It has an internal state of 624 32-bit numbers. Given the output of 1248 values you know the entire state at some point. From that you can with 100% accuracy determine what all future outputs will be.

Now, how do I read the key from the file for decrypting it? If I use line.split("":""), wouldn't it cause problem if the encrypted key itself had "":"" as a character?

Of course it would—that's why exactly split has a second, optional argument max_split:
key, value = line.split(':', 1)

Alternatively, you can use partition:
key, _, value = line.partition(':')

The difference between the two is what happens when there isn't a colon at all; the former will return one element, giving you a ValueError from trying to unpack it into two variables, while the latter will just give you an empty value.

However, it's worth noting that if you're using Base 64, : is never going to appear in the first place. The only character used by Base 64 are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, and /. There are some Base 64 variants, and maybe one of them does use :, but the standard version, as applied by Python's base64 module, does not.

Thanks in advance for any advice regarding this issue.
","If you look at the encrypt method:

plaintext (byte string or long) - The piece of data to encrypt with RSA. It may not be numerically larger than the RSA module (n).

Your data is not a byte string or long. If you want to input text then you first need to use a character encoding such as UTF-8 for input.
Note that ""plaintext"" is just the input for the cryptographic primitives. All modern ciphers operate on bytes. Historically the input may have been actual text, but not anymore.

Also note that:

Attention: this function performs the plain, primitive RSA encryption (textbook). In real applications, you always need to use proper cryptographic padding, and you should not directly encrypt data with this method. Failure to do so may lead to security vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use modules Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEP or Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_v1_5 instead.

For these functions it is also required to convert your text to byte arrays.

"14859006","Using PyCrypto to decrypt Perl encrypted password","I'm trying to decrypt a pass phrase stored in a file.  The encryption was done with the Perl::CBC module, but I need to decrypt it for a Python script.  Frankly, I don't know much (or anything really) about encryption algorithms. 
The pass phrase was encrypted something like this:
use Crypt::CBC;

my $key = '0123456789';
my $iv  = '$KJh#(}q';

my $cipher = Crypt::CBC->new(
    -key    => $key,
    -cipher => 'Blowfish',
    -header => 'none',
    -iv     => $iv,
);

my $passphrase = 'You have decrypted the passphrase.';
my $hex_encrypted = $cipher->encrypt_hex($passphrase);

which gives an encrypted passphrase: 9033c838e4418fbdc50a9fc0813745296d195d59954008f94b2b36a8e65dca959686206960a7828a
Now, I need to use this in a Python script (using Python 2.7). Naively, I was hoping this would work:
from Crypto.Cipher import Blowfish
from binascii import hexlify, unhexlify

perl_pass =  unhexlify('9033c838e4418fbdc50a9fc0813745296d195d59954008f94b2b36a8e65dca959686206960a7828a')
key = '0123456789'
iv  = '$KJh#(}q'
print Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_CBC, iv).decrypt(perl_pass)

but that only seems to create a bunch of unprintable junk.  I've played around a bit without success.  I'm not really sure what I need to do here to get this password decrypted successfully.
","The ""key"" you give to Crypt::CBC is actually a passphrase, from which a 'literal key' is generated; Crypto.Cipher.Blowfish needs that literal key, rather than the passphrase. You can print that generated key in hex from your Perl program, then use it in Python:
use Crypt::CBC;

my $key = '0123456789';
my $iv  = '$KJh#(}q';

my $cipher = Crypt::CBC->new(
    -key    => $key,
    -cipher => 'Blowfish',
    -header => 'none',
    -iv     => $iv,
);

my $passphrase = ""You have decrypted the passphrase."";
my $hex_encrypted = $cipher->encrypt_hex($passphrase);

print unpack('H*', $cipher->key()), ""\n"";

You have decrypted the passphrase.

Note that there will be a few unprintable characters at the end: Blowfish-encrypted strings must be a multiple of 8 bytes, so Perl silently pads it. The byte it's padded with is the length of the padding: in this case, six bytes of padding, so each of them is 0x06. You can easily remove them:

","I am not sure this applies to your situation, but some googling led to this:
(from http://wiki.python.org/jython/JythonFaq/InstallingJython)

Jython cannot find your Java class,
  even though it exists in the class
  path. This shows up as ""ImportError:
  cannot import name xxx"" or
  ""AttributeError: java package xxx' has
  no attribute 'yyy'""
This happens when Jython is installed
  as a Java extension (i.e. when
  jython.jar is installed in
  java\jre\lib\ext) and your classes
  are installed in the classpath.
The reason is Java extensions can only
  see other extensions, not other
  classes defined in the CLASSPATH or
  passed in to java using the
  --classpath option.
There are two ways to fix this:
1) Move your classes to the
  java\jre\lib\ext directory.
2) Remove jython.jar from the
  java\jre\lib\ext directory and put
  jython.jar in the CLASSPATH or use the
  java --classpath option.
(from the Jython-users mailing list)

And another, similar issue, but different nonetheless:
(from http://bugs.jython.org/issue1878866)

I have a similar problem in Linux with jython 2.5. Inside
  jython2.5.0/Lib/site-packages a have a foo directory where there is a
  Java class (Bar.class) and a jython class (BarPy.py). i have also put an
  empty __init__.py file. In the jython interpreter environment I can
  always import Bar like this: ""from foo import Bar"" however I cannot
  import BarPy. If I delete the java class from the directory then I can
  import the jython script

"38043056","Verify signature on X509 certificate in Python","I have an RSA public key and a signed X509 certificate. How can I check that the key signed the certificate? (My example happens to be a self-signed certificate.)
Here's what I'm doing now:
Generate self-signed cert and convert to DER encoding with openssl cli:
(I'm expecting DER in my real application)
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout selfsigned.key -nodes -out selfsigned.cert -sha256 -days 1000
openssl x509 -outform der -in selfsigned.cert -out self.der

Decode it to a Crypto.Util.asn1.DerSequence instance.
>>> from Crypto.Util.asn1 import DerSequence
>>> from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
>>> der = open('self.der').read()
>>> cert = DerSequence()
>>> cert.decode(der)
905L
>>> # according to RFC5280, this is a 3-length sequence:
>>> # tbsCertificate, signatureAlgorithm, signatureValue
>>> # ""tbs"" == ""to be signed""
>>> len(cert)
3

Then I pull the RSA public key out:
>>> tbscert = DerSequence()
>>> tbscert.decode(cert[0])
>>> subjectPublicKeyInfo = tbscert[6]
>>> rsa_key = RSA.importKey(subjectPublicKeyInfo)
>>> >>> rsa_key
<_RSAobj @0x7fb27287d128 n(2048),e>

Then I pull the signature out
This is very annoying. I'm using another library to decode the DER again because this one gives me a slightly more convenient representation of the ""bit string"" encoding of the signature value. For now, I copy and paste the base-2 string representation of the value into int() to get a long (what the RSA.verify() method expects).
>>> from pyasn1_modules import  rfc2437,rfc2459
>>> from pyasn1.codec.der import decoder
>>> cert2,rest = decoder.decode(der, asn1Spec=rfc2459.Certificate())
>>> sig_bits = cert2.getComponentByName(""signatureValue"")
>>> sig_bits

Then I compute the SHA256 hash of the ""to be signed certificate"":
>>> import Crypto.Hash.SHA256
>>> comp_hash = Crypto.Hash.SHA256.new(cert[0]).digest()
>>> comp_hash
'\xa3t\x84\xd6\xf5\xfe\x16\xb9\xdb(&\x12\xb3m^+\x94\xa7bZ\xf9s\xf7\xbay\xa1j\xa3Y\xea\xa8\x7f'

Then the verify() method tells me the signature doesn't match.
>>> rsa_key.verify(comp_hash, (sig_long, None))
False

I hope there's a better way (this doesn't even work), but I've spent hours looking at PyCrypto and PyOpenSSL and haven't found it.

This similar S.O. question from a few years ago has no answer: Verify SSL/X.509 certificate is signed by another certificate
","I guess one way to accomplish this is to create an X509StoreContext containing only one certificate corresponding to the public key I want to check for.
>>> from OpenSSL import crypto
>>> x509_self_signed # already loaded
<OpenSSL.crypto.X509 object at 0x7fcc4049c9b0>
>>> cert_store = crypto.X509Store()
>>> cert_store.add_cert(x509_self_signed)
>>> store_ctx = crypto.X509StoreContext(cert_store, x509_self_signed)
>>> store_ctx.verify_certificate()
>>> # ^ that raises an exception if it fails to verify

verify_certificate() was added to PyOpenSSL only a little over a year ago, so maybe that's why it was hard to find...

","The short answer to your question is: Yes, AES is the same in PyCrypto and Node.js' crypto module. Node's crypto is just a wrapper around openssl on your system, and PyCrypto is interoperable with OpenSSL (see http://lists.dlitz.net/pipermail/pycrypto/2010q4/000301.html).
Having said that, there are definitely bugs in the Node crypto module (though I've only experienced problems with base64 encoding, myself). So whether it's a bug or not, the problems you're experiencing are almost certainly happening in the data encoding/decoding stages.
What does your ciphertext look like? Is it a hexadecimal string? If so, then you need to do
buf = decipher.update(buf, 'hex', 'binary')

","That's not how IV works in Node, you have to use crypto.createDecipheriv(cipher, key, iv) instead, otherwise you get a default baked-in one. Even in PyCrypto you should be using the third argument to AES.new as the IV, not stuffing it into the bytestream.

","Documentation does not mention this, but aeskey you're passing to crypto.createDecipher is not the key, but a password, handled to OpenSSL's EVP_BytesToKey function.
To pass the actual raw key data one should use (presently undocumented) crypto.createDecipheriv(cipher, key, iv) function. This applies to ECB mode too, even though there's no IV in ECB.
If this fails, I think, the first step in debugging would be to try with AES KATs to see whenever the decryption code is correct.

","Make sure you use the same key and IV in both pycrypto and node.js!! Not only that, but make sure you have the same encoding in both ends:

I have a table of email addresses, and I would like to encrypt them for storage.  I am trying to encrypt them in the application, and then will decrypt them for viewing.  I'm not going for complete security but am mainly aiming to obfuscate the data enough were the database itself compromised.  
I'm using PyCrypto with AES, and have been trying to follow some posts on here and some web tutorials I found.  The closest I found so far is this post, and it seems to work, at least encrypting it.  I follow that and get something like ""7hBAQrWhJRnL9YdBGJfRErGFwGi3aC6noGzYTrGwAoQ="" stored in the database.  But the decrypt function keeps erroring with this: 
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xa1 in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)

I came across some unicode presentation about Python which sort of helped me make more sense of it but I still keep getting the same error.
Is there a straightforward tutorial on how to encode, store in a database, pull out of database, and decode a source data string?
Do I need a specific collation on the database column?  Does the field need to be a certain type?  So far I've been using a default collation and setting it to VARCHAR, assuming that I was storing a string.  It sounds like I've got some encoding problem somewhere with incompatible types or something but my head is spinning on where I need to change something.
Any better pointers or anything else I can provide?  I can show my code but its basically a copy of the link above... I was just trying to get a proof of concept working before modifying it too much.

","The general rule with PyCrypto is that cryptographic keys, IVs, plaintexts, paddings, and ciphertexts should always be defined as binary strings, not text. The fact you use Unicode for them is by itself a source of problems.
Another problems is that you pass to AES.new key and IV in hexadecimal encoded form, so that the former is 256 bits and the latter 128 bits. That seems still to work, but I guess your intention was to use AES128 - which has a 128 bit key. You therefore need to convert it to binary, for instance via unhexlify: the two character string b'34' will map to the single byte '\x34'. The IV needs to be twice as long.
In your code it's therefore better to have:
from binascii import unhexlify

INTERRUPT = b'\x01'
PAD = b'\x00'
SECRET_KEY = unhexlify('a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8')
IV = unhexlify('12345678abcdefgh'*2)

If you need to encrypt text, you would first encode it (e.g. to UTF-8) and then pass it to your function EncryptWithAES(). See also this example taken from the PyCrypto API:
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto import Random

key = b'Sixteen byte key'
iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
msg = iv + cipher.encrypt(b'Attack at dawn')

The result of the encryption step (that is, the ciphertext) is again a binary string. In order to store it directly in the MySQL DB you must use either a BINARY or a VARBINARY type column.

Essentially, I do not know of a sensible way to install PyCrypto on Mac OS X 10.8 in such a way that dev_appserver.py will use it - other than the workaround of putting Crypto/ into the project's root directory.
Unfortunately an issue seems to have just cropped up that causes a project to crash when the project is deployed with Crypto/ in the project's root.
It may be possible to edit or monkeypatch the GAE code, but I am not familiar enough with GAE's code to be comfortable doing that. All of the suggestions I have seen were for Python2.5 and Mac OS X < 10.8.
I would be grateful for thoughts about alternative, sensible ways to get PyCrypto working with the GAE development appserver on Mac OS X 10.8.
","This is the madness I have had to engage in:

Delete all version of PyCrypto
Download PyCrypto v2.3 from https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/tags and install with
dlitz-pycrypto-7e141bd/$ python setup.py build
dlitz-pycrypto-7e141bd/$ sudo python setup.py install

(version 2.6 balks with a no blockalgo package)
Apply to dev_appserver_import_hook.py in /Application/GoogleAppEngineLauncher.app/Contents/Resources/GoogleAppEngine-default.bundle/Contents/Resources/google_appengine/google/appengine/tools/ the patch suggested in comment 1 of Issue 1627, i.e. add
try:
  import Crypto as _CryptoTest
  _CryptoBase = os.path.dirname(_CryptoTest.__file__).replace(
    os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.__file__), 'site-packages'),
     """") # removes preceding slash 
  del _CryptoTest
except ImportError:
  logging.info(""No Crypto could be imported"")
  _CryptoBase = ""Crypto""

around line 314
then modify the ALLOWED_SITE_PACKAGES lines from
ALLOWED_SITE_PACKAGE_FILES = set(
    os.path.normcase(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(
    os.path.dirname(os.__file__), 'site-packages', path)))

to
ALLOWED_SITE_PACKAGE_FILES = set(
    path

and change all references from 'Crypto' to _CryptoBase in the GeneratePythonPaths calls for ALLOWED_SITE_PACKAGES.
(I would expect if one is using dev_appserver from the command line i.e. /usr/local/google_appengine, the dev_appserver_import_hook.py would be modified there)
Restart the project.

Obviously one must rinse and repeat the patch whenever Google App Engine is updated.

Note — This issue appears to have been fixed as of patch 1.7.4 released 14 Dec. 2012.

"44892946","RSA encryption in python & decrypt in JS","I am totally new in Cryptography. I want to generate RSA key pairs from server side and send it to all of the clients (browsers). But before that I am testing the scenario by simply encrypting data in python and sending in to index.html file via pubnub and trying to decrypt it in JavaScript. The problem is that when I do encryption by;
random_generator = Random.new().read
key = RSA.generate(1024, random_generator)
print key.exportKey() #<--private key
public_key = key.publickey()
print public_key.exportKey() #<--public key
msg = ""hello""
enc_data = public_key.encrypt(msg, 32)
print '----ENCRYPTED DATA----'
enc = enc_data[0] 

and send the encrypted data enc, it gives me this error:
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xc4 in position 2: invalid continuation byte

I tried to convert it into  
enc = base64.b64encode(enc_data[0])

and it is send with no error. but the JS decrypt method gets None 
  var enc_from_python = $('#input').val();
  console.log(""ENCRYPTED data:"", enc_from_python);
  var decrypt = new JSEncrypt();
  decrypt.setPrivateKey($('#privkey').val());
  var uncrypted = decrypt.decrypt(enc_from_python);
  console.log("">>>"",uncrypted);  //<-- this is None ! why ?

Both of the code do enc/dec very well on their own. I have also tried to enc/dec the data in JS with the received key pairs from python and that works well. I guess the problem is with the unicode encoding format of encoded data from Pycrypto which does not match. Could any one tell me what am I missing over here.

Actually, I don't know what does lambda do but I think that I get this error because of it. Thanks.
","you're reading your text file as rb which in python 3 returns a bytes object.
In the function, you're padding with a str object, hence the error. Python 3 clearly separates binary data from text data, a thing that python 2 didn't do.
    PADDING = '{'
    pad = lambda s: s + (BLOCK_SIZE - len(s) % BLOCK_SIZE) * PADDING

Change open('Aes/plaintext.txt', 'rb') by open('Aes/plaintext.txt', 'r') and you'll get ascii on both sides, that will work.
(or change PADDING to bytes('{',encoding=""ascii"") or as James stated just b""{"").

"31756166","Python 3 - Socket Chat Encryption with PyCrypto gives UnicodeDecodeError","I am trying to setup a socket chat with encryption in Python 3, but when decoding UTF-8 it gives an error.

port = 5558
IV = Random.new().read(16) 
c = AES.new('abcd1234efgh5678', AES.MODE_CFB, IV)

host = ''
port = 5558
IV = Random.new().read(16)

After running these programs the server gives this error:
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xa5 in position 0: invalid start byte
So, I tried changing 'utf-8' in the Server code to 'latin-1' and it instead kept printing different unicode characters each time the program was run. I then swapped the 2 lines marked with comments in both the client and server, and of course it gave this error:
AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'
I have tried Google but all of the programs that use PyCrypto use Python 2, not 3. Eg. Encrypt & Decrypt using PyCrypto AES 256
http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2010/06/25/aes-encryption-of-files-in-python-with-pycrypto/
","apart from the fact that your code above uses // as comments (should be #), i ran the code below (removed everything socket) and found the error: you re-initialize the IV before decrypting. this way you will not get the original value back - just some gibberish that may not be decodable in utf-8.
you will have to send the IV to the server (How to communicate AES initialization Vector to client for hybrid cryptosystem).

","This is the solution provided in this blog post
Edit the file inttypes.h and add just before the line of the error:
#define intmax_t long long
#define uintmax_t unsigned long long

Also, the solution provided in this StackOverflow question by @user1602 seems better, since it doesn't involve changing files in Windows SDK:

A workaround for Microsoft VC compiler is to force include
  stdint.h via OS environment variable CL:

Open command prompt
Setup VC environment by runing vcvars*.bat (choose file name depending on VC version and architecture)
set CL=-FI""Full-Path\stdint.h"" (use real value for Full-Path for the environment)

","The Javascript library (pidCrypt) uses PKCS#1 v1.5 for RSA encryption, not OAEP.
That is supported by PyCrypto (see here). This is the example for encryption:
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_v1_5
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Hash import SHA

message = 'To be encrypted'
h = SHA.new(message)

key = RSA.importKey(open('pubkey.der').read())
cipher = PKCS1_v1_5.new(key)
ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(message+h.digest())

And decryption:
from Crypto.Hash import SHA
from Crypto import Random

key = RSA.importKey(open('privkey.der').read())

dsize = SHA.digest_size
sentinel = Random.new().read(15+dsize)      # Let's assume that average data length is 15

cipher = PKCS1_v1_5.new(key)
message = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext, sentinel)

digest = SHA.new(message[:-dsize]).digest()
if digest==message[-dsize:]:                # Note how we DO NOT look for the sentinel
     print ""Encryption was correct.""
else:
     print ""Encryption was not correct.""

Note that PKCS#1 v1.5 encryption scheme is know to be badly broken.

ValueError: AES key must be either 16, 24, or 32 bytes long

error no matter the size of the key.
My code for generating the AES object is
def AESEncryptor(Seed, Block = 16): #Generate AES key and Cipher
    iv = Random.new().read(Block)
    cipher = AES.new(Seed.encode('utf8'), AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    return cipher, iv

And my code for generating the key is 
def genNewSeed(k=2048): #Generate seed for new AES key
    return hashlib.sha256(os.urandom(32)).hexdigest()[:11]

Which, according to sys.getsizeof() is equal to 32 bits yet it still returns the error
","The problem is that you're slicing off only 11 bytes from a hex-encoded ""seed"" of 64 characters. Keep in mind that keys are supposed to have high entropy, otherwise it's easier to brute force them.
I suggest you use:
def AESEncryptor(Seed, Block = 16): #Generate AES key and Cipher
    iv = Random.new().read(Block)
    cipher = AES.new(Seed, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    return cipher, iv

def genNewSeed(k=2048): #Generate seed for new AES key
    return hashlib.sha256(os.urandom(32)).digest()

This will give you a 32 byte key which makes this AES-256. If you want AES-128, then you can slice the last 16 bytes off:
hashlib.sha256(os.urandom(32)).digest()[:16]

You cannot use sys.getsizeof() to determine the size of a key, because it includes all kinds of internal counters and data. For example, an empty string has already a size of 21 bytes. That's why you would thought that you got 32 byte when you only got 11 (21 + 11 = 32). Use the built-in len(key) instead.

","jsencrypt depends on the jsbn library which doesn't provide OAEP, but only PKCS#1 v1.5 padding.
You have to use the same in python which PyCrypto provides. Simply use PKCS1_v1_5 instead of PKCS1_OAEP.

Note that PKCS#1 v1.5 padding shouldn't be used today anymore. I suggest you use the forge library which provides an RSA implementation with OAEP.

UPDATE: Thanks to the accepted answer below, now I see:

My solution seems to be pretty valid for now (very few log entries, no performance considerations, more or less trusted storage). Concerning security, the best thing I can do right now is not forgetting to prohibit the user who runs my daemon from writing to the .py and .pyc files of the program. :-) However, if the user is compromised, he still may try to attach a debugger to my daemon process, so I should also disable login for him. Pretty obvious moments, but very important ones.
Surely there are solutions being much more scalable. A very common technique is to encrypt AES keys with slow but reliable RSA, and to encrypt data with the AES that is pretty fast. Data encryption in the case is symmetric, but retrieving the AES key requires either breaking RSA, or getting it from memory when my program is running. Stream encryption with higher-level libraries and binary log file format also are a way to go, though binary log format encrypted as a stream should be very vulnerable to log corruption, even a sudden reboot due to electricity blackout may be a problem unless I do some things at a lower level (at least log rotation on each daemon start).
I changed .encode('hex') to .encode('base64').replace('\n').replace('\r'). Fortunately, the base64 codec works fine with no line ends. It saves some space.
Using an untrusted storage may require signing records, but that seems to be another story.
Checking if the string is encrypted based on catching exceptions is ok, since, unless the log is tampered with by a malicious user, it's base64 codec who raises an exception, not RSA decryption.

","You seem to encrypt data directly with RSA. This is relatively slow, and has the problem that you can only encrypt small parts of data. Distinguishing encrypted from plaintext data based on ""decryption doesn't work"" is also not a very clean solution, although it will probably work. You do use OAEP, which is good. You may want to use base64 instead of hex to save space.
However, crypto is easy to get wrong. For this reason, you should always use high-level crypto libraries wherever possible. Anything where you have to specify padding schemes yourself isn't ""high-level"". I am not sure if you will be able to create an efficient, line-based log encryption system without resorting to rather low-level libraries, though.
If you have no reason to encrypt only individual parts of the log, consider just encrypting the entire thing.
If you are really desperate for a line-based encryption, what you could do is the following: Create a random symmetric AES key from a secure randomness source, and give it a short but unique ID. Encrypt this key with RSA, and write the result to the log file in a line prefixed with a tag, e.g. ""KEY"", together with the ID. For each log line, generate a random IV, encrypt the message with AES256 in CBC mode using said IV (you don't have any length limits per line now!) and write the key ID, IV and the encrypted message to the log, prefixed with a tag, e.g. ""ENC"". After a certain time, destroy the symmetric key and repeat (generate new one, write to log). The disadvantage of this approach is that an attacker who can recover the symmetric key from memory can read the messages encrypted with said key. The advantage is that you can use higher-level building blocks and it is much, much faster (on my CPU, you can encrypt 70,000 log lines of 1 KB per second with AES-128, but only around 3,500 chunks of max. 256 bytes with RSA2048). RSA decryption is REALLY slow, by the way (around 100 chunks per second).
Note that you have no authentication, i.e. you won't notice modifications to your logs. For this reason, I assume you trust the log storage. Otherwise, see RFC 5848.

","If you look at the page source for the website in question, you will see that it uses gibberish-aes javascript library. To see whet you have to do to make it work, you have to study what it does.
Looking through its source code, it seems to use a random salt for encryption. That, prepended by the string Salted__ forms the beginning of the cyphertext before it is base64 encoded.
randArr = function(num) {
    var result = [], i;
    for (i = 0; i < num; i++) {
        result = result.concat(Math.floor(Math.random() * 256));
    }
    return result;
},

and
enc = function(string, pass, binary) {
        // string, password in plaintext
        var salt = randArr(8),
        pbe = openSSLKey(s2a(pass, binary), salt),
        key = pbe.key,
        iv = pbe.iv,
        cipherBlocks,
        saltBlock = [[83, 97, 108, 116, 101, 100, 95, 95].concat(salt)];
        string = s2a(string, binary);
        cipherBlocks = rawEncrypt(string, key, iv);
        // Spells out 'Salted__'
        cipherBlocks = saltBlock.concat(cipherBlocks);
        return Base64.encode(cipherBlocks);
    },

For decryption, it uses picks the random portion of the salt out of the beginning of the cyphertext after base64 decoding (the first slice operator):
dec = function(string, pass, binary) {
    // string, password in plaintext
    var cryptArr = Base64.decode(string),
    salt = cryptArr.slice(8, 16),
    pbe = openSSLKey(s2a(pass, binary), salt),
    key = pbe.key,
    iv = pbe.iv;
    cryptArr = cryptArr.slice(16, cryptArr.length);
    // Take off the Salted__ffeeddcc
    string = rawDecrypt(cryptArr, key, iv, binary);
    return string;
},

The missing piece now is the openSSLkey function:
openSSLKey = function(passwordArr, saltArr) {
    // Number of rounds depends on the size of the AES in use
    // 3 rounds for 256
    // 2 rounds for the key, 1 for the IV
    // 2 rounds for 128
    // 1 round for the key, 1 round for the IV
    // 3 rounds for 192 since it's not evenly divided by 128 bits
    var rounds = Nr >= 12 ? 3: 2,
    key = [],
    iv = [],
    md5_hash = [],
    result = [],
    data00 = passwordArr.concat(saltArr),
    i;
    md5_hash[0] = GibberishAES.Hash.MD5(data00);
    result = md5_hash[0];
    for (i = 1; i < rounds; i++) {
        md5_hash[i] = GibberishAES.Hash.MD5(md5_hash[i - 1].concat(data00));
        result = result.concat(md5_hash[i]);
    }
    key = result.slice(0, 4 * Nk);
    iv = result.slice(4 * Nk, 4 * Nk + 16);
    return {
        key: key,
        iv: iv
    };
},

So basically you have to translate the openSSLKey function to Python and feed it your password and salt. That creates a (key, iv) tuple. Use those to encrypt your data. Prepend the string Salted__ and the salt to the ciphertext before encoding it with base64. Then it should work, I think.

","First you should know how Python 3 treats strings differently than in Python 2.
In Python 2, """" is a byte array, but in Python 3 it's a unicode string. Both cipher.encrypt and cipher.decrypt expect byte arrays.
So even though in both pieces of code, the type of your parameter is fine. Your problem in Python 3 is with calling str.encode. It's pretty easy to see that it indeed caused a change by looking at the string length:
>>> len(encrypted_string)
10
>>> len(encrypted_string.encode('utf-8'))

The solution:
First of all notice that in Python 2:
>>> ""¨vóîÄdX|@9"" == '\xc2\xa8v\xc3\xb3\xc3\xae\xc3\x84dX|@9'
True

In Python 3, you need to mark your string with the binary prefix (b""""), your new definition should use: encrypted_bytes = b'\xc2\xa8v\xc3\xb3\xc3\xae\xc3\x84dX|@9'
Thus your solution should be:
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto import Random

key = ""18945BKJVO9W834G""
iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
encrypted_bytes = b'\xc2\xa8v\xc3\xb3\xc3\xae\xc3\x84dX|@9'
decrypted_bytes = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_bytes)
print(decrypted_bytes)

","First, you should be encrypting only binary data, not Unicode text. That means str type (in Python 2.x) or bytes (in Python 3.x and most recent Python 2.x). You must encode text before encrypting it, and you must decode it after you decrypt.
Second, the byte string you are encrypting must be smaller than the RSA modulus (e.g. less than 256 bytes for RSA2048). If your data is longer, think of using an intermediate AES session key.
Third, if you use PyCrypto 2.5, there is no good reason for using the .encrypt/.decrypt methods of the RSA key object. It is better and more secure to use one of the PKCS#1 methods: OAEP or v1.5. With them, the plaintext must be even shorter.

How can I set PyCrypto to use a 32 byte initialization vector and 32 byte block size?
Alternatively, is there a different library that I can use to decrypt the data?
","Thanks to the comments I implemented a suitable solution. I modified rijndael.py in the linked duplicate question to accept bytes rather than strings. I then use it as follows to decrypt 32-byte blocks with the 32-byte initialization vectors.

Note that using this rather than PyCrypto is only necessary because libmcrypt incorrectly sets the data block sizes, and thus the initialization vector sizes, to be equal to the key sizes. As far as I understand, data block sizes should always be 128 bits for AES-Rijndael.

The encryption python script
The encrypted message 
The exported public key

I tried to import the public key and then decrypt but I think I have to figure out the private key in order to decrypt the message.
The encryption code is:
import gmpy
from Crypto.Util.number import *
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_v1_5

message = open('message', 'r').read() * 30

def ext_rsa_encrypt(p, q, e, msg):
    m = bytes_to_long(msg)
    while True:
        n = p * q
        try:
            phi = (p - 1)*(q - 1)
            d = gmpy.invert(e, phi)
            pubkey = RSA.construct((long(n), long(e)))
            key = PKCS1_v1_5.new(pubkey)
            enc = key.encrypt(msg).encode('base64')
            return enc
        except:
            p = gmpy.next_prime(p**2 + q**2)
            q = gmpy.next_prime(2*p*q)
            e = gmpy.next_prime(e**2)

p = getPrime(128)
q = getPrime(128)
n = p*q
e = getPrime(64)
pubkey = RSA.construct((long(n), long(e)))
f = open('pubkey.pem', 'w')
f.write(pubkey.exportKey())
g = open('msg.enc', 'w')
g.write(ext_rsa_encrypt(p, q, e, message))

","As pointed out in the comments 256 keys are quite small and can be factorized easily. First you have to reconstruct the prime numbers used in key generation. Finding the modulus and exponent is an easy one liner with openssl:
$ openssl rsa -in <your-public-key> -pubin -text -modulus

This should output something like
Exponent: <decimal-value> (<hex-value>)
Modulus=<hex-value>

Now you can factorize the modulus with msieve or search for it within the https://factordb.com/ database. This will give you your ""p"" and ""q"".
Since the encryption code is not quite RSA you have to write your own decrypt function, which should look like this: 
def ext_rsa_decrypt(p, q, e, msg):
    m = bytes_to_long(msg)
    while True:
        n = p * q
        try:
            phi = (p - 1)*(q - 1)
            d = gmpy.invert(e, phi)
            privkey = RSA.construct((long(n), long(e), long(d)))
            key = PKCS1_v1_5.new(privkey)
            enc = key.decrypt(msg, ""a"")
            return enc
        except Exception, ex:
            traceback.print_exc()
            p = gmpy.next_prime(p**2 + q**2)
            q = gmpy.next_prime(2*p*q)
            e = gmpy.next_prime(e**2)

Now you should have everything you need to decrypt the message, just don't forget to base64 decode the encrypted message before passing it to the decrypt function.

Each part of the key is ran from 3,000 - 10,000 times trough a SHA256 and finally the 128 bit key is generated. Script all in all takes ~0.8 - 1 second to complete.

- Is there a better practice to generate a dynamic, time limited key for data encryption ?
My goal was to have a key that is limited to 60-120 seconds and then discard it, use multiple cycles to generate the keys (thanks to reading the python way for Truecrypt ), so if any data is caught it wouldn't be decrypted ""easily"" . 
Also, the server model will have a SSL cert that it will use to encrypt the encrypted. 
I was thinking of giving a static key for each client script (RSA generated), that would be used to for AES encryption. 
Thank you on your honest answers and any new ideas to improve this. 
","Yes, and don't! Cryptographic technologies take years to develop and test for a reason, they're extremely hard to get right. It sounds like you might want to look at using RSA or some other PKI infrastructure. If I were you I would look into PyCrypto https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/. Either way, don't implement your own cartographic system it will be broken and insecure!

"10083291","Encrypting data in Python -","I'm writing a client - server model ( client is a script on a server that gathers data and sends it via REST to the server ) and want to encrypt the data that is sent. 
At the moment I have a function that generates the a random key, which adds time from a specific timezone - IP-HOSTNAME-YEAR-MONTH-DAY-HOUR-(MINUTE/2) 
Each part of the key is ran from 3,000 - 10,000 times trough a SHA256 and finally the 128 bit key is generated. Script all in all takes ~0.8 - 1 second to complete.
Data is encrypted via AES , using parts of the 128 bit key for the key and iv. 
The server script, listens for any connections, verifies if the IP address is listed and then proceeds to decrypt the data (using the same method to generate the key and iv )
My question is:
- Am I reinventing the wheel ? 
- Is there a better practice to generate a dynamic, time limited key for data encryption ?

Thank you on your honest answers and any new ideas to improve this. 
","Using the simplest SSL/TLS (without PKI) as transport protection for REST is probably the most effective way to get the wheel right the first time.
Beside that, you should clarify a few topics. For instance:

Is it important that the client does not get deceived by an attacker which may be impersonating the server? If it is, then you have to properly setup PKI so that the client can authenticate the server with a certificate. Alternatively you can use TLS-SRP.
Is it important that the server does not get deceived by an attacker which may be impersonating a real user? If it is, then you have to setup an authentication scheme: for instance HTTP Digest, SSL client certificates, TLS-SRP, etc.
Is it important that a compromise at the client or server does not jeopardize data exchanged in previous sessions? If it is, then you have to restrict the cipher suite to cipher that offer perfect forward secrecy (DHE).

Only if you have troubles in setting up SSL you should consider rolling up your own protocol.

"34054808","How to make Python Crypto AES faster","I'm looking for a very fast way for encrypting and decrypting short text snippets. Security is secondary in my use-case. Light encryption with a constant IV is fine. I'm currently doing this:
BS = 16
pad = lambda s: s + (BS - len(s) % BS) * chr(BS - len(s) % BS)
unpad = lambda s : s[:-ord(s[len(s)-1:])]

import base64
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

iv = '0123456789012345'
def encrypt(raw, key):
    raw = pad(raw)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    return base64.b64encode( cipher.encrypt( raw ) )

def decrypt(enc, key):
    enc = base64.b64decode(enc)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    return unpad(cipher.decrypt( enc ))

enc_text = encrypt('Hello World!','xyz1234567890abc')
print decrypt(enc_text, 'xyz1234567890abc')

How can I make this faster? Maybe by using another AES mode (MODE_CBC?), or is there a faster padding function, a faster way of hex-converting the output?
","Counter mode (AES.MODE_CTR) will be faster for multi-block messages, as it can be parallelized for both encryption and decryption. CBC is serial on encryption because the resulting output of each block-cipher operation is fed as input to be XOR with the plaintext of the next block before encrypting. Because CTR generates a keystream by encrypting each (sequential) counter value with the key, it does not rely on the output of any previous block operation and can perform the tasks in parallel. 
In addition, because CTR operates as a stream cipher, no message padding is required, so you'll save time on that operation in and out. 
Note: Don't re-use counters. You mentioned that confidentiality is a secondary concern here, but while re-using IVs in CBC mode is ""bad"", re-using counters in CTR mode is end of the world bad. Just use a sequential counter (literally i++) combined with 64 bits of the ms since epoch start and you'll be fine. (See Stream Reuse or Many Time Pad Attack for good examples of why).

","Quite a few algorithms in PyCrypto are actually written in C, rather than in pure python. SHA256 is amongst them. In order to use it, you must either install a complete pycrypto binary package or follow the instructions in the PyCrypto's README file. In the latter case, you will need to install the development environment first.
Both options are platform and OS specific, but once done, it will be simply a matter of calling:

2. M2Crypto
Tried to install M2Crypto but it fails with cannot find openssl/err.h header file. So I've installed openssl 1.1.0e and copied lib and include directories to C:/pkg directory and it throws different error like:
SWIG/_m2crypto_wrap.c(3754) : error C2065: 'CRYPTO_NUM_LOCKS' : undeclared ident ifier
And found precompiled M2Crypto msi installer but during runtime it throws following error:
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
This library seems outdated and not enough documentation available.
3. signxml
So far it's the only library that works partially for me.
Xml verification works fine but it throws error on sign: ValueError: Could not unserialize key data.
from xml.etree import ElementTree
from signxml import XMLSigner, XMLVerifier
from myapp import settings

cert = open(settings.STATIC_ROOT + '/file/public.cert', 'rt').read()
key = open(settings.STATIC_ROOT + '/file/public.key', 'rt').read()

root = ElementTree.fromstring('<xml1>12</xml1>')
signed_root = XMLSigner().sign(root, key=key, cert=cert)
verified_data = XMLVerifier().verify(signed_root).signed_xml
print verified_data

","The answer to the question in the title is signxml.
It is the library designed for the stated purpose. PyOpenSSL and M2Crypto operate on lower-level objects than XML signature; verifying the latter would involve canonicalizing XML, digesting proper parts of it, and comparing the provided signature over the digest. While possible, this is not trivial and provides much space for errors. For example in your code for PyOpenSSL you do not base64-decode the signature value.
With signxml, your example is mostly correct. For verification of the signature, you do not need the private key, so the error you get is not relevant to the question. You should in general read the certificate and the key in binary, not text mode (open(filename, ""rb"")) - even if the files are PEM-encoded.
The following is a working example:
from xml.etree import ElementTree
from signxml import XMLSigner, XMLVerifier

cert = open(""cert.pem"", ""rb"").read()
key = open(""key.pem"", ""rb"").read()

xml_obj = ElementTree.fromstring(""<Example/>"")
signed_xml_obj = XMLSigner().sign(xml_obj, key=key)
XMLVerifier().verify(signed_xml_obj, x509_cert=cert)

If your XML object has been serialized and de-serialized after signing, this simplest code might be not enough; the (complicated) details are described here.

","The most often used solution is to write some ""magic"" string at the beginning of the encrypted file followed by the encrypted content. If that string is found when reading the file, further encryption is refused. For decription it is read to veryfiy that this is a file we encrypted, but otherwise it is ignored.
Imagine you're using ""MyCrYpT"" as the magic (although it doesn't matter what you use as long as it is reasonably unique.
magic = ""MyCrYpT""
# writing the encrypted file
with open(out_filename, 'wb') as outfile:
    outfile.write(magic)  # write the identifier.
    outfile.write(struct.pack('<Q', filesize))  # file size
    outfile.write(iv)
    # et cetera

Now, when reading the file, we read all the data, and then check if it is ours. Then we discard the magic and process the rest.
with open(in_filename, 'rb') as infile:
    data = infile.read()
    if data[:len(magic)] != magic:
        raise ValueError('Not an encrypted file')
    filedata = data[len(magic):]

"21409231","pip lists wrong installed version of package?","On Ubuntu 10.04, my problem is that pip freeze and sudo pip freeze both report the wrong version of a package installed. I can do sudo pip install -I pycrypto --upgrade and it will go through and install the package (version 2.6.1), but then pip freeze lists the installed version as 2.0.1. I also cannot uninstall the package, so it seems like something is going wrong. How can I fix this?
Output:
$ sudo pip uninstall pycrypto
Can't uninstall 'pycrypto'. No files were found to uninstall.
$ pip uninstall pycrypto
Can't uninstall 'pycrypto'. No files were found to uninstall.

For reference and common issues, I have pip installed, and can do: 
$ pip --version
pip 1.5.2 from /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages (python 2.6)

And I see the correct pip version, seems like everything is good there. sudo pip --version also yields the same output. I can diff the outputs from pip freeze and sudo pip freeze and there are no differences there. which pip and sudo which pip yield the same thing.
More Info:
If I do pip install -I pycrypto --upgrade without sudo I get an error that maybe someone could clarify? When I install with sudo I get no errors. I feel like this is related, but not my issue.

","So for anyone who has a similar issue, I think the problem is that I somehow had the python-crypto package installed from aptitude, as well as pycrypto installed with pip. To check this I did dpkg --get-selections and saw that python-crypto was installed, so I removed that with sudo apt-get remove python-crypto and then I was able to do sudo pip uninstall pycypto. That finally got it to disappear from pip freeze so I could then install the correct version.

I have a hex text 0x3a3456abcd4ff5cd to encrypt with hex keys so how can I convert these values to equivalent strings so that I can use existing libraries to work with them.
Here's what I've tried, but it represents 8 byte key to equivalent 13 byte string:
from Crypto.Cipher import DES
text =(unichr(4).decode('utf-8')*8).encode('utf-8')

key1=(unichr(0x46)+unichr(0xb2)+unichr(0xc8)+unichr(0xb6)+unichr(0x28)+unichr(0x18)+unichr(0xf8)+unichr(0x84)).encode('utf-8')

key2=(unichr(0x4a)+unichr(0x5a)+unichr(0xa8)+unichr(0xd0)+unichr(0xba)+unichr(0x30)+unichr(0x58)+unichr(0x5a)).encode('utf-8')

des = DES.new(key1,DES.MODE_ECB)
cipher_text = des.encrypt(plain_text)
print 'the cipher text is ', cipher_text

des = DES.new(key2,DES.MODE_ECB)
print 'the decrypted text is: ', des.decrypt(cipher_text)

","To use the two keys in your example, assign them like this:
key1 = '\x46\xb2\xc8\xb6\x28\x18\xf8\x84'

key2 = '\x4a\x5a\xa8\xd0\xba\x30\x58\x5a'

This will keep the keys at 8 bytes each, allowing you to use them in DES.new.

","Presumably there is no way to do this, because AES specifies a block size of 128 bits (16 bytes). Note that the key size is different and can vary (128, 192, or 256 bits).

The AES cipher is almost identical to the block cipher Rijndael. The
  Rijndael block and key size vary between 128, 192 and 256 bits.
  However, the AES standard only calls for a block size of 128 bits.
  Hence, only Rijndael with a block length of 128 bits is known as the
  AES algorithm.

If you want a variant that has another block size but is otherwise identical, you should be looking at implementations of Rijndael, not AES.

I know both of these languages pretty well, but I have no idea about the encryption field (especially AES). I wrote this AES code before in C#, but now I have no idea how to make it work in Python (I'm using PyCrypto since Python2.7 does not have built-in AES). Below is my C# code:

Please note that I want also to have BlockSize = 128, KeySize = 256, Padding = PKCS7, and Cipher CBC for Python. Thanks in advances!
","I realize this question is almost a year old but I found it when looking for some solutions to communicate with a legacy windows process that uses the PKCS7 padding in its implementation of AES.  Here is a quick example that works great for me.  Hopefully it proves useful to someone else down the line.  I had the same block size, key size, and padding as the question author specified.
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from pkcs7 import PKCS7Encoder
import base64

shared_key = ""abc123ty9TW1abc123ty9TW1"" #some random key for a working example
IV = ""rTF25nTrrTF25nTr"" 

clear_text = ""Testing 123""
aes = AES.new(shared_key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)
aes.block_size = 128
cipher_text = base64.b64encode(aes.encrypt(PKCS7Encoder().encode(clear_text)))
print(cipher_text)

aes_decrypter = AES.new(shared_key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)
aes_decrypter.block_size = 128
clear_text = PKCS7Encoder().decode(aes_decrypter.decrypt(base64.b64decode(cipher_text)))
print(clear_text)

The pkcs7 padding utility I'm using was copied from a Github project:
import binascii
import StringIO

class PKCS7Encoder(object):
    def __init__(self, k=16):
       self.k = k

    ## @param text The padded text for which the padding is to be removed.
    # @exception ValueError Raised when the input padding is missing or corrupt.
    def decode(self, text):
        '''
        Remove the PKCS#7 padding from a text string
        '''
        nl = len(text)
        val = int(binascii.hexlify(text[-1]), 16)
        if val > self.k:
            raise ValueError('Input is not padded or padding is corrupt')

        l = nl - val
        return text[:l]

    def encode(self, text):

","In the piece of Python code, you are creating an RSA signature that does not follow any real protocol or standard. In other words, it's raw and in most cases it is not secure.
Instead, you should use something like PSS (use the pycrypto module PKCS1_PSS here). In the Botan code, that can by verified with the EMSA4 encoding.
Alternatively you could use PKCS#1 v1.5. In Botan, that is EMSA3.
In either case, the hash algorithm must be the same at both sides.

Note that the test case provides two sets of keys for Alice and Bob, the first generated by OpenSSL and the second generated by PyCrypto (uncomment the section 'Alternate keys').
The test case is a simple round trip:

Alice generates a symmetric key and encrypts the data
Alice encrypts the symmetric key with Bob's public key, then signs the encrypted key with her private key (hashes are not used in this simple test case).
Bob verifies the signature with Alice's public key and decrypts the
symmetric key with his private key.
Bob decrypts the data with the symmetric key.

Is there any reason why PyCrypto seems to be such a basket case?
","First, I would consider the cases where the OpenSSL keys are used. The most important fact is that Bob's RSA modulus (bn) is slightly smaller than Alice's RSA modulus (an).
The error Ciphertext too big shows up at the ""sender"" (that is, within the generation function). The ciphertext you ""sign"" is guaranteed
to be smaller than an (because encryption is computed modulo an) but it may sometimes (due to the plaintext being random) happen to be larger than bn. In that case, signature is not possible.
As far as I can tell, the check is performed and an exception is raised only if you have the GMP library installed, which is often the case on Linux systems.
On Windows, it is difficult to install such library, and pycrypto relies on pure python code. The exception will be not be raised in that case (though it should, the two versions should behave in the same way), and you will silently get the wrong value as signature (Bad signature).
The error AES key must be either 16, 24, or 32 bytes long shows up when your random AES
key starts with 0x00. Since the RSA primitive converts the byte string into an integer, the leading zero will lost in the process, and you will get back that error at the receiving end.
If you generate RSA keys on the fly, in 50% of the cases bn>an and you will see fewer errors.
I am not able to understand why 100% of the tests fail on Linux with OpenSSL keys, but I guess there is a similar reason to explain that.
In general (and this holds also for all other crypto libraries), the root cause of all problems is that you are using the raw RSA mechanisms. Beside considerations
about limitations and correct way to use the API, you have a big security hole. Some form of secure padding must always be used, otherwise an attacker can easily break your scheme.
In PyCrypto, proper protocols are available via the PKCS#1 modules for both RSA signatures and RSA encryption. However, mind that signature must be done on the message hash (e.g. SHA1), and encryption on a payload which is considerably smaller than the RSA modulus.

","Solution: exporting/importing keys using exportKey() and importKey()
Why your conversion does not work
Converting the key to a string using str() does not work, as you can see from the example below.
>>> k = RSA.generate(1024)
>>> pk = k.publickey()
>>> str(pk)
'<_RSAobj @0x10e518908 n(1024),e>'

As you can see from the example above, the function str() just returns the string '<_RSAobj @0x10e518908 n(1024),e>' which does not show the actual key.
Converting the key object into a string
A good way to convert the key into a string is to export it using a standard format, for example the well-known PEM format, as shown below.
>>> pkstring = pk.exportKey(""PEM"")
>>> pkstring
'-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQC4SD0YSMWYAU27mFVKsHgtKWzM\n9jfvs2Xl+zCQpAHNtvYWTo6mnyWTwH4lGn7ulYdGx5gAJj6OlWg+CKoHXqPOh6e4\nP8DM97dM9QfP8d7el2ZCz1+5oMd8iQo+WPTM1qa5TMj9rZMpwAnSrS490LW6ZpTL\n7fChg3APljnspQ/7nQIDAQAB\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----'

Now, the string returned by pk.exportKey(""PEM"") corresponds to the actual key.
Converting the string back to a key object
This is also very easy, you can just type:
>>> importedpk = RSA.importKey(pkstring)

Now you can use the encrypt method with the importedpk key which has been converted from the string pkstring.
To prove you that importedpk has been loaded correctly, just type the following two commands on the python interpreter.
pk.encrypt(""Hello"", 12)
importedpk.encrypt(""Hello"", 12)

They should return the same output. In particular, if you type
pk.encrypt(""Hello"", 12) == importedpk.encrypt(""Hello"", 12)

the result should be
True

How to fix your code
In server code, replace
if c.send(str(public_key)):
  print ""Public Key Sent""

with
if c.send(public_key.exportKey(""PEM"")):
  print ""Public Key Sent""

In client code, replace
public_key = s.recv(1024)

with
public_key = RSA.importKey(s.recv(1024))

Now although the above produces a very similar output but it is not the right one. Why? Because when the output of the java code above is sent to the backend, I receive a HTTP 200 OK and the expected response. 
However, when the output of the python code above is sent similarly to the backend, I receive a 500 internal server error, meaning (as per my assumption, given that all the other params, headers etc. remain exactly the same between the java and the python HTTP requests) the input to the backend was not correct and hence it broke (again please ignore the 500, I agree it should be something more meaningful and definitely not a 500)
I do not have access to the backend. It is more of a red team - blue team exercise we are doing
Also, I could possibly invoke the java code above from python and still manage to achieve the end result and get the work done, but that'd be more of a hack, which would although be sufficient, but I am more interested in knowing how exactly can I achieve the same with Python alone.
As per some suggestions in the comments below I tried this as well:
So I tried this as well:
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_v1_5

def encryptMsg(secret):
    message = secret
    key = RSA.importKey(open('myPubkey.pem').read())
    cipher = PKCS1_v1_5.new(key)
    ciphertext = b64encode(cipher.encrypt(message))
    return ciphertext

and then in the while loop, this:
localStringBuilder1 = localStringBuilder1 + encryptMsg(str(localObject)) + ':::'

Still doesn't seem to work. Same results as before.

The libraries I'm using are as3crypto and pycrypto, I'm not sure if I'm using these libraries correctly.
Actionscript 3:

  var t_toEnc:String = 'testtest';
  var t_byAry:ByteArray = Hex.toArray( Hex.fromString( t_toEnc ) );
  var t_key:ByteArray = Hex.toArray( Hex.fromString( 'Thisisthekey' ) );

This is the base64 encoded output of the function above.

Now, using the same key, initialization vector, and algorithm from the pycrypto library gives me different output.

S = 'testtest'
X = B.encrypt( S )

Y = base64.b64encode( X )
print Y

I'm pretty sure that I'm doing something wrong with the encryption process because I can base64 encode 'testtest' on both libraries and receive the same output.
Actionscript 3:
var b:ByteArray = new ByteArray();
b.writeUTFBytes( 'testtest' );
dbg( Base64.encodeByteArray( b ) );

Yields...

Python:
>>> T = 'testtest'
>>> print base64.b64encode( T )

Yields

Could someone please encrypt and base64encode the same string with the same IV in either python or actionscript, so I know which library is actually producing the correct output?
","The problem might be in padding. ActionScript uses no padding, but Py doesn't show what padding it uses. So, it can be the reason. Try another padding (PKCS#5 for instance) with actionscript.

One open pull request (link) validates RSA and DSA as they are constructed. The tests are more robust than what you show above, even though a malicious user may still craft a weak key and have it pass them.
For DSA keys, it goes like this:
# Modulus must be prime
fmt_error = not isPrime(key.p)
# Verify Lagrange's theorem for sub-group 
fmt_error |= ((key.p-1) % key.q)!=0 
fmt_error |= key.g<=1 or key.g>=key.p
fmt_error |= pow(key.g, key.q, key.p)!=1 
# Public key
fmt_error |= key.y<=0 or key.y>=key.p 
if hasattr(key, 'x'):
    fmt_error |= key.x<=0 or key.x>=key.q 
    fmt_error |= pow(key.g, key.x, key.p)!=key.y

The main branch (see lib/Crypto/PublicKey/DSA.py) has code to import DSA keys in SSH format:
if extern_key.startswith(b('ssh-dss ')):
    # This is probably a public OpenSSH key
    keystring = binascii.a2b_base64(extern_key.split(b(' '))[1])
    keyparts = []
    while len(keystring) > 4:
        length = struct.unpack("">I"", keystring[:4])[0]
        keyparts.append(keystring[4:4 + length])
        keystring = keystring[4 + length:]
    if keyparts[0] == b(""ssh-dss""):
        tup = [bytes_to_long(keyparts[x]) for x in (4, 3, 1, 2)]
        return self.construct(tup)

","The problem is in deserializing the signature tuple.
PyCrypto is expecting a tuple with an integer as the first value, you are passing it a string with a beginning paren ""("" and then a string version of a number.
Instead of doing this:
signature_tuple = signature.split("","")

do this
signature_tuple = eval(signature)

That will properly parse the signature.
Now, there are security risks with using eval. So, if I were you, I'd come up with a better serialization/deserialization process.

I read in the password from the user and salt from a file.
I then call PBKDF2 to generate a key from the textual password
PBKDF2(self.master_password, salt, 32)

I then generate an IV using the Random.get_random_bytes
IV = Random.get_random_bytes(len(key))

I then create a Counter from the Crypto.Util package
ctr = Counter.new(32, IV)

Then I create an AES object
e = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr)

However when I call e to encrypt
e.encrypt(user_name)

I get the following error
CTR counter function returned string not of length 16

From the way I understand this error means that the block cipher is 16 bytes which matches with the documentation I found at
https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/Crypto.Cipher.AES-module.html
I tried changing it to a 32 byte block size by create the AES object like this
AES_Encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr, block_size=32)

but then I get the following error
'block_size' is an invalid keyword argument for this function

If someone could point me towards the right direction that'd be great.
","AES is a block cipher with a fixed block size of 128 bit (16 byte). It has three valid key sizes of 128 bit, 192 bit and 256 bit. A nonce for CTR mode, also called IV sometimes, needs to be at most as long as the block size which is 16 bytes. 
If you want a 256 bit block size, you can't use AES. There are several other algorithms that permit a 256 bit block size such as Rijndael, but there is no implementation of that in pycrypto. AES is a subset of Rijndael.
Usually, we generate a nonce of either 64 bit or 96 bit for CTR mode in order to have some control over how many blocks we can encryption without a counter collision.
nonce = Random.get_random_bytes(8)  # 8 bytes
ctr = Counter.new(64, nonce)        # 64 bits remaining

or
nonce = Random.get_random_bytes(12) # 12 bytes
ctr = Counter.new(32, nonce)        # 32 bits remaining

For a 64 bit nonce, you can encrypt at most 264 blocks before running into problems. That's more than any data in the world, but the issue is that by choosing the nonce at random, you have a probability of 1 to get a nonce collision after 232 encryptions with the same key due to the birthday paradox.
For 96 bit nonces, you can encryption at most 232 blocks which is roughly 68 GB of data, but you have a much lower chance of getting a nonce collision.
The nonce is not secret, so you can send it along with the ciphertext. Usually, it is simply prepended to the ciphertext and sliced off before decryption. Since you know how long it is supposed to be, you know how much you can slice off.

"15623417","Encrypt/Decrypt an animated gif in Python without storing the final copy to HD","Okay, let's try this again.
I'm trying to encrypt an animated gif with PyCrypto to be sent to someone. After the receiver gets it, they should be able to run my pycrypto script and view the animated image- WITHOUT storing the unencrypted file to the hard drive. Essentially I'm trying to save the unencrypted file in-memory so that it can be accessed by another library without saving it to the disk. 
For encryption I've been using
import os, random, struct
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

def encrypt_file(key='8c57d066796428d5a8f4b012155dad90', in_filename='tile.png', out_filename=None, chunksize=8192):
    """""" Encrypts a file using AES (CBC mode) with the
        given key.

        key:
            The encryption key - a string that must be
            either 16, 24 or 32 bytes long. Longer keys
            are more secure.

        in_filename:
            Name of the input file

        out_filename:
            If None, '<in_filename>.enc' will be used.

        chunksize:
            Sets the size of the chunk which the function
            uses to read and encrypt the file. Larger chunk
            sizes can be faster for some files and machines.
            chunksize must be divisible by 16.
    """"""
    if not out_filename:
        out_filename = in_filename + '.enc'

    iv = ''.join(chr(random.randint(0, 0xFF)) for i in range(16))
    encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    filesize = os.path.getsize(in_filename)

    with open(in_filename, 'r') as infile:
        with open(out_filename, 'w') as outfile:
            outfile.write(struct.pack('<Q', filesize))
            outfile.write(iv)

            while True:
                chunk = infile.read(chunksize)
                if len(chunk) == 0:
                    break
                elif len(chunk) % 16 != 0:
                    chunk += ' ' * (16 - len(chunk) % 16)

                outfile.write(encryptor.encrypt(chunk))

, but that doesn't seem to be doing anything at all. I don't even know where to begin on the decryption part because again, I need to be able to access the decrypted file without storing it to the hard drive.
Thanks guys.
","How about using StringIO instead of an actual disc file called out_filename? 
Just use a virtual disc with the same structure.  
Example:
import StringIO

f=StringIO.StringIO()

for line in ['line {}\n'.format(i) for i in range(25)]:
    f.write(line)

f.seek(0)

for line in f:
    print line.strip() 

So you would need to replace with open(out_filename, 'w') as outfile: ... with a call to outfile=StringIO.StringIO() and the rest should be the same.
Like so:
with open(in_filename, 'r') as infile:
    outfile=StringIO.StringIO()
    outfile.write(struct.pack('<Q', filesize))
    outfile.write(iv)

    while True:
        chunk = infile.read(chunksize)
        if len(chunk) == 0:
            break
        elif len(chunk) % 16 != 0:
            chunk += ' ' * (16 - len(chunk) % 16)

        outfile.write(encryptor.encrypt(chunk))

I'll mention that I'm not particularly crypto savvy (I took a college course, but that's about it) and I'm also not a Delphi programmer, so that is also probably hindering my efforts to decipher what precisely DCPcrypt is doing.
This is the meat of the Delphi code:
Cipher: TDCP_rijndael;
begin
Cipher:= TDCP_rijndael.Create(nil);
Cipher.InitStr(PasswordField.Text);
Cipher.EncryptCBC(encryptString[1],encryptString[1],Length(encryptString));

So the implementation uses a key (obtained from the password field) but no IV.  PyCrypto on the other hand requires an IV.  Searching through the internals of the DCPcrypt code, it appears that if the IV is nil, then an ECB encryption is used to populate the IV from a string of 0xff?
procedure TDCP_rijndael.Init(var Key; Size: longint; IVector: pointer);
....
  if IVector= nil then
  begin
    FillChar(IV,Sizeof(IV),$FF);
    {$IFDEF CFORM}Encrypt(IV,IV){$ELSE}RijndaelEncryptECB(Data,IV,IV){$ENDIF};
    Move(IV,LB,Sizeof(LB));
  end

It appears that I'm using a static IV.  However, I am not able to make this work.  Here's my implementation in PyCrypto.  Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
key = ""password""
s = hashlib.sha1()
s.update(key)
key = s.digest()
key = key[:16]

# Set up the IV, note that in ECB the third parameter to the AES.new function is ignored since ECB doesn't use an IV
ecb = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB, '\xff' * 16)
iv = ecb.encrypt('\xff' * 16)

cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
msg = cipher.decrypt(ct[:16])

I have some plain text that was encrypted using the Delphi code and then base64 encoded.  The key used was the string password, as hardcoded in above.  Using my implementation, I decrypt a bunch of garbled bytes.

","A random assortment of suggestions and thoughts:

Static IVs are generally a security risk as they open the door to known plaintext attacks.
Looking at the dcpcrypt source, it looks like there is a method to specify an IV. Any reason not to, if for no other reason than to eliminate incorrect IV as an error source?
Likewise, you could experiment with ECB instead of CBC to eliminate the IV altogether and isolate whether the problem is in the IV or elsewhere (key, data, or configuration).

","DISCLAIMER: I'm extremely new to Python, but try this:
Try changing
key = key[:16]

to
key = key + bytes([0,0,0,0])

This will give you a 24 byte key which, I think, should work.
DCP allows any length of key whereas Crypto insists on keys of 16, 24 or 32 bytes. By default DCP will use SHA1 to generate the key, which is then 20 bytes long. Based on this DCP uses logic for keylength <= 24 and just zero pads the key rather than logic for keylength <= 16 which is the effect that key[:16] is having. 
Also, don't know if this is just a typo but try changing the AES mode
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)

to
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)

That will give a decryption of your input. But then you'll need to consider padding of the original source text because DCP does not pad (I think) but Crypto requires multiples of 16 for decryption.

","If you need to add padding to make the plaintext a multiple of 16 bytes, the extra bytes need to be stripped before you write the decrypted data. This means you will need to somehow include the number of pad bytes added with the padding before you encrypt it. See PKCS#7 for one possible technique. There are a number of other schemes as well.

I am running Windows 7 64-bit. From what I found this binary from Voidspace does not install winrandom correctly because winrandom does not have a 64-bit binary. I have tried compiling a 64-bit version using VS 2008, but this is way outside of my knowledge and I don't know if I am doing it right. I followed the following directions for PyCrypto but instead tried to compile the winrandom source. 
","Since pycrypto is part of the third-party libraries for Google App Engine, it should not be necessary to manually install pycrypto to use it in your project. Instead, you need to add the library to your app.yaml:

","I don't have direct experience with CryptoJS, but many years of experience with a variety of other crypto libraries.  It's almost certainly the case the CryptoJS.AES.decrypt expects a different ciphertext format than the one you're using.  Your ciphertext is the contanenation of two separate Base64-encoded entities:
Base64(IV) + Base64(Enc(Message))
If CryptoJS.AES.decrypt expects the IV to be specified as part of the ciphertext (which it may not), and expects Base64-encoded ciphertext input at all (which it may not), then I would try passing:
Base64( (binary IV) + (binary Enc(Message)) )
Looking at the CryptoJS doc, I share your frustration with it.  But there's an encryption example with ""manually specified IV"" that may provide a clue.
<script src=""http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/aes.js""></script>
<script>
    var key = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse('000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f');

","I ran into this problem as well and unfortunately it was very tricky to get pycrypto to talk to crypto-js.  Here are the combination that worked for me:

Use MODE_CFB with segment_size=128 when encrypting in Python
You must pad your string with Pkcs7 as per RFC 2315 [Page 21]
Once you have received the base64 version of ciphertext in JS, you need to wrap it in
CryptoJS.lib.CipherParams.create({ ... })

But I need output S1NaeUFaUHdqc20rQWM1L2ZVMDJudz09 which will PHP decrypt to secret. How to modify Python code to get expected output?
","PHP's hash outputs a Hex-encoded string by default, but Python's .digest() returns bytes. You probably wanted to use .hexdigest():
def __init__(self, key, iv):
    self.key = hashlib.sha256(key.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()[:32].encode(""utf-8"")
    self.iv = hashlib.sha256(iv.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()[:16].encode(""utf-8"")

The idea of the initialization vector (IV) is to provide randomization for the encryption with the same key. If you use the same IV, an attacker may be able to deduce that you send the same message twice. This can be considered as a broken protocol.
The IV is not supposed to be secret, so you can simply send it along with the ciphertext. It is common to prepend it to the ciphertext during encryption and slice it off before decryption.

","According to BlockAlgo#encrypt from which the AES class is derived:

Encrypt data with the key and the parameters set at initialization.
The cipher object is stateful; encryption of a long block of data can be broken up in two or more calls to encrypt(). That is, the statement:
c.encrypt(a) + c.encrypt(b)

is always equivalent to:
c.encrypt(a+b)

That also means that you cannot reuse an object for encrypting or decrypting other data with the same key.

I've tried cutting the list into 1024 slices and trying the above, but even one of these slices takes way too long. I cut one of these slices into 128 yet smaller slices, and that took about 620ms each. If it grew linearly, then that means the whole thing would take about 22 and a half hours to complete. That sounds alright, but it doesn't grow linearly.
Another thing I've tried is generating random numbers for every entry and using those as indices for their new location. I then go down the list and attempt to place the number at the new index. If that index is already in use, the index is incremented until it finds a free one. This works in theory, and it can do about half of it, but near the end it keeps having to search for new spots, wrapping around the list several times.
Is there any way to pull this off? Is this a feasible goal at all?
","So one way is to keep track of which numbers you have already given out and keep handing out new random numbers one at a time, consider
import random
random.seed(0)

class RandomDeck:
      def __init__(self):
           self.usedNumbers = set()

      def draw(self):
          number = random.randint(0,2**32)
          while number in self.usedNumbers:
                 number = random.randint(0,2**32)
          self.usedNumbers.append(number)
          return number

      def shuffle(self):
          self.usedNumbers = set()

As you can see we essentially have a deck of random numbers between 0 and 2^32 but we only store the numbers we have given out to ensure we don't have repeats. Then you can re-shuffle the deck by forgetting all the numbers you have already given out.
This should be efficient in most use cases as long as you don't draw ~1 million numbers without a reshuffle.

","If you have a continuous range of numbers, you don't need to store them at all. It is easy to devise a bidirectional mapping between the value in a shuffled list and its position in that list. The idea is to use a pseudo-random permutation and this is exactly what block ciphers provide. 
The trick is to find a block cipher that matches exactly your requirement of 32-bit integers. There are very few such block ciphers, but the Simon and Speck ciphers (released by the NSA) are parameterisable and support a block size of 32-bit (usually block sizes are much larger).
This library seems to provide an implementation of that. We can devise the following functions:
def get_value_from_index(key, i):
    cipher = SpeckCipher(key, mode='ECB', key_size=64, block_size=32)
    return cipher.encrypt(i)

def get_index_from_value(key, val):
    cipher = SpeckCipher(key, mode='ECB', key_size=64, block_size=32)
    return cipher.decrypt(val)

The library works with Python's big integers, so you might not even need to encode them. 
A 64-bit key (for example 0x123456789ABCDEF0) is not much. You could use a similar construction that increased the key size in DES to Triple DES. Keep in mind that keys should be chosen randomly and they have to be constant if you want determinism.

If you don't want to use an algorithm by the NSA for that, I would understand. There are others, but I can't find them now. The Hasty Pudding cipher is even more flexible, but I don't know if there is an implementation of that for Python.

Design considerations
While Garrigan Stafford's answer is perfectly fine, the memory footprint of this solution is much smaller (a bit more than 4 GB). Another difference between our answers is that Garrigan's algorithm takes more time to generate a random number when the amount of generated numbers increases (because he keeps iterating until an unused number is found). This algorithm just looks up the next unused number if a certain number is already used. This makes the time it takes to draw a number every time practically the same, regardless of how far the pool of free numbers is exhausted.

","Computing all the values seems impossible, since Crypto compute a random integer in about a milisecond, so the whole job take days.
Here is a Knuth algorithm implementation as a generator: 
from Crypto.Random.random import randint

def onthefly(n):
    numbers=np.arange(n,dtype=np.uint32)
    for i in range(n):

        yield numbers[i]

For n=10 :        
gen=onthefly(10)
print([next(gen) for i in range(9)])
print(next(gen))
#[9, 0, 2, 6, 4, 8, 7, 3, 1]
#5

For n=2**32, the generator take a minute to initialize, but calls are O(1).

","The default cloud images for GCE are pretty stripped down, and don't include things like compilers, etc because you don't necessarily want a compiler on your webserver.
Using apt to install pycrypto works; if you do want a compiler, use apt-get install gcc.  Similarly, you may want to install x11, emacs, etc if you're using your VM for development.
Using the pycrypto package from Debian is a good idea if you want to make sure that you get security updates, so I'd recommend that over installing your own.

But it's cryptographically wrong in many ways:

The key looks like 32 character hex string (which would encode a 128-bit key), but you actually need to treat it as ASCII encoding a 32-byte key. That's wrong, since keys are supposed to be uniformly distributed binary string
Similarly an IV is supposed to be a uniform binary, but it's actually ASCII
The IV is fixed, but the whole point of an IV is to be different (unpredictably random for CBC mode) for each message.
CBC mode is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, which allow an active attacker to recover the plaintext if they can execute a chosen ciphertext attack where they learn which ciphertext decrypt successfully.

You should use authenticated encryption with unique IVs instead.

I realized that undefined symbol: PyUnicodeUCS2_FromString must be because of the new build, so I then tried reinstalling everything fresh (new Python and new pip and newly installed libraries). I still had the same errors.
Is it simply not possible to use the Crypto library with Python wide-build?
I could not find any documentation on this. Are there any known work-arounds?
Thank you for any help!
","There is no satisfactory solution for this problem in Python 2: the UCS2 and UCS4 builds have incompatible ABIs, and require libraries to be built from source (as most binary eggs are built against the default UCS2 ABI). This issue details the problem, and the resolution that made it into Python 3.3 (PEP 393).
Your rationale for using a UCS4 build is a little suspect, though. A UCS2 build of Python is perfectly capable of ""work[ing] with some unicode characters with high values"", using surrogate pairs to represent supplementary code points.

I have very limited Python and Crypto experience. The code uses the snippet from the following page. http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/1095/
So far I believe I have managed to work out that it that it calls Crypto.Cipher with AES and the first 32 character of our secret key as the password, but no mode or IV. It also puts a prefix on the encrpyed text when it is added to database.
What I can't work out is how I can decrypt the existing ecrypted database records in .NET. I have been looking at RijndaelManaged but it requires an IV and can't see any reference to one in python. 
Can anyone point me in the dirrection to what method could be used in .NET to get the desired result.
","AES (and Rijndael) requires a mode and an IV.  The IV may be a vector of zeroes, but it is still an IV.  the mode may not be explicitly specified... but if it's using AES, there's still a mode.
Try this answer for some background:
Which AES library to use in Ruby/Python?

I am Signing a message(data) using:

        Signature dsa = Signature.getInstance(""SHA1withRSA"");

        dsa.initSign(privateKey,secureRandom);
        dsa.update(data);

}

This returns a byteArray(named signed_data) , now I am encoding this signature using Base64.encodeBase64 and converting the byteArray(named my_byte_array) so formed into string using :
String str = new String(my_byte_array)

and sending this string to Server.
On server side, I receive this string , then Server verifies the signature using:
publicKey.verify(str(data), (long(base64.b64decode(my_byte_array)),))

using library http://gdata-python-client.googlecode.com/hg/pydocs/gdata.Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.html
when I try to print my_byte_array on both side they are same, and so is signed_data and base64.b64decode(my_byte_array)

As far as I can think, this error is arising because Java signs the message into byte and python expects it to be in Long.
Is there a way to solve this problem?
","You have actually 2 problems.
The first one is that - according to the Java Cryptograpy Architecture API - the SHA1withRSA algorithm involves PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. At the Python side, you must use the same padding scheme to verify the signature; that can be achieved with PyCrypto's PKCS#1 v1.5 signature module (Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_v1_5).
The second problem is the one you point out: the verify method of an RSA PyCrypto object
oddly requires the signature to be encoded as an integer. However, by using the module I mentioned above, the problem will go away, since it accepts byte strings.

","Your code is fine. PKCS#1 v1.5 padding in pyCrypto is randomized (source). So the encryption will always be different even if you use the same key and plaintext. This is a desirable property.
If you want to check compatibility between pyCrypto and PHP's OpenSSL extension, then you would need to encrypt in one, decrypt in the other and check that you got what you expected.

PKCS#1 v1.5 padding should not be used nowadays, because there are efficient attacks against it. OAEP is a much better alternative.

Someone has an idea how php encrypts the data, I suppose it is a padding problem but am not sure and I am open for any help on this topic.
","I made some modifications to my Python code which seems to solve the issue:
import base64
from Crypto.Cipher import AES 

IV = 16 * '\x00'

def decrypt(enc, key):
    decobj = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)
    data = decobj.decrypt(base64.b64decode(enc))
    print(str(data.decode()))

key = ""0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv""
decrypt(""uPNXdo2K0Gvy/+MW0YFR7utFsrNDAp8yYaDxT352W3lPKNOkNMg+l3eFKEi0zeze"", key)

On the command line I did not found a solution yet.

There is little to no documentation on the exact options that CommonCrypto uses, so I'm needing some help figuring out what options to set in PyCrypto.
Specifically, my CommonCrypto decryption setup call is:
CCCryptorCreateWithMode(kCCDecrypt, kCCModeCFB, kCCAlgorithmAES128, ccDefaultPadding, NULL, key, keyLength, NULL, 0, 0, 0, &mAESKey);

My primary questions are:

Since there is both a kCCModeCFB and kCCModeCFB8, what is CommonCrypto's definition of CFB mode - what segment size, etc?
What block size is the CommonCrypto AES128 using?  16 or 128?
What is the default padding, and does it even matter in CFB mode?

Currently, the first 4 bytes of data is decrypting successfully with PyCrypto *as long as I set the segment_size to 16*.
Ideas?
","Without knowing CommonCrypto or PyCrypto, some partial answers:

AES (in all three variants) has a block size of 128 bits, which are 16 bytes.
CFB (cipher feedback mode) would actually also work without padding (i.e. with a partial last block), since for each
block the ciphertext is created as the XOR of plaintext with some keystream block, which only depends on previous blocks.
(You still can use any padding you want.)
If you can experiment with some known data, first have a look at the ciphertext size. If it is not a multiple of a
full block (and the same as the plaintext + IV), then it is quite likely no padding.
Otherwise, decrypt it with noPadding mode, have a look at the result, and compare with the different known padding modes.
From a glance at the source code, it might be PKCS#5-padding.
CFB8 is a variant of CFB which uses only the top 8 bits (= one byte) of each block cipher call output (which takes the
previous 128 bits (= 16 bytes) of ciphertext (or IV) as input). This needs 16 times as many block cipher calls, but
allows partial sending of a stream without having to worry about block boundaries.
There is another definition of CFB which includes a segment size - here the segment size is the number of
bits (or bytes) to be used from each cipher output. In this definition, the ""plain"" CFB would have a segment size of 128 bits (= 16 bytes), CFB8 would have a segment size of 8 bits (one byte).

"22132775","Combining WinCrypt & PyCrypto Encryption","I'm writing a native-C program which (among others) handles encryption/decryption of data. The data is processed (before or after execution) using a python script, whose main purpose is to encrypt/decrypt the data (and perhaps do some additional parsing of it).
I'm having problems in decrypting the data generated by WinCrypt API, using PyCrypto API, and vice-versa. Specifically I've experienced this problem in AES-256 based encryption. Both sides of the encryption/decryption scheme run on the same machine, and are provided the same encryption key. They are both CBC based and (if the documentation is not lying) are initialized with a 0-based initialization vector. However, no matter what I try to do, they don't seem to get along. The resulting data (encrypted using WinCrypt & decrypted using PyCrypto or vice versa) is all messed up (not even close to the original). Just to be clear - each of the mechanisms works on its own (decrypting WinCrypt-encrypted data using WinCrypt works perfectly, and the same for PyCrypto).
The native encryption code is based on WinCrypt's examples. It generally looks like the following code:
HCRYPTPROV hCryptProv;
HCRYPTKEY hKey;
HCRYPTHASH hHash;
CHAR szPassword[PASSWORD_LENGTH] = """";
DWORD dwLength;
PBYTE pbBuffer = NULL;   
DWORD dwBufferLen; 
DWORD dwCount; 

CryptAcquireContext(&hCryptProv, NULL, NULL, PROV_RSA_AES, 0);
CryptCreateHash(hCryptProv, CALG_MD5, 0, 0, &hHash);
CryptHashData(hHash, (BYTE *)szPassword, dwLength, 0);
CryptDeriveKey(hCryptProv, CALG_AES_256, hHash, 0, &hKey);

CryptEncrypt(hKey, NULL, FALSE, 0, pbBuffer, &dwCount, dwBufferLen);
CryptDecrypt(hKey, 0, FALSE, 0, pbBuffer, &dwCount);

(This is just a general scheme, and obviously the actual code contains all the necessary error handling, handles cleanup, etc).
The PyCrypto code:
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
context = AES.new(""K""*32, mode=AES.MODE_CBC, IV=""\x00""*16)
context.encrypt(ORIGINAL_DATA)
context.decrypt(ENC_DATA)

I want to use the ElGamal private-public key encryption module in PyCrypto for the encryption, but the problem is that it has no export function to save the key to a text file. Am I missing something? And if not, is there a clever way that I can export it, or something else that I should look at instead? 
PS. The reason for using ElGamal and not RSA is that I can make the keys smaller than 1024 bytes, which makes for a smaller, less complicated qr code.
","You can use access the ElGamal key components directly, since they are member of the key object.
In Python 2.x, one could do the following to print out the components in a text file:

"26835539","AES_128_CTR encryption by openssl and PyCrypto","Wondering the right way to convert a AES_128_CTR encryption by openssl to PyCrypto.
First, I did an encryption by openssl as following:
openssl enc -aes-128-ctr -in input.mp4 -out output.openssl.mp4 -K 7842f0a1ebc38f44e3e0c81943f68582 -iv d01f40dfc8ec8cd9

And then, I tried to do the same thing through PyCrypto:
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util import Counter
key = '7842f0a1ebc38f44e3e0c81943f68582'
iv = 'd01f40dfc8ec8cd9'

ctr_e = Counter.new(128, initial_value=int(iv, 16))
encryptor = AES.new(key.decode('hex'), AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr_e)

with open('output.pycrypto.mp4', 'wb') as fout:
    with open('input.mp4', 'rb') as fin:
        fout.write(encryptor.encrypt(fin.read()))

I assume they are supposed to be similar, but it is not:
diff output.openssl.mp4 output.pycrypto.mp4
Binary files output.openssl.mp4 and output.pycrypto.mp4 differ

","OpenSSL behaves as expected (fortunately, as documentation to this fact is missing for the command line) and uses the given IV as leftmost bytes of a big endian counter. In other words, the bytes given are the most significant part of the 16 byte counter. The code in the question uses the IV as initial counter value, i.e. it is interpreted as the least significant part of the counter.
Now it took me some time to fix the Python code as there are two problems with the Counter class I had to work around:

the size of the counter should be 64 bit instead of 128 bit if a prefix of 8 bytes is used; this is a design feature, but it may cause overflow if the amount of bits reserved for the counter is small (it's OK with the current setting of 64 bit though)
the default initial counter value is set to 1 while CTR mode always starts counting at 0; this is likely an off-by-one bug in the Counter design

So without further ado:
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util import Counter

key = '7842f0a1ebc38f44e3e0c81943f68582'.decode('hex')
iv = 'd01f40dfc8ec8cd9'.decode('hex')

ctr_e = Counter.new(64, prefix=iv, initial_value=0)
encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr_e)

with open('output.pycrypto.mp4', 'wb') as fout:
    with open('input.mp4', 'rb') as fin:

","You are not using a correct encryption scheme. From the documentation:

Even though you may choose to directly use the methods of an RSA key object to perform the primitive cryptographic operations (e.g. _RSAobj.encrypt), it is recommended to use one of the standardized schemes instead (like Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_v1_5 or Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_v1_5).

although nowadays the more modern/safe Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEP should be preferred over Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_v1_5.
If you use one of these schemes then the output will always be 128 bytes. The reason for that is that PKCS#1 specifies a function called I2OSP, which converts the result of the modular exponentiation (which is a number bounded by the modulus/the key size) to a static number of octets, the key size to be exact.
The output of the direct encrypt function is what is called raw or textbook RSA: just modular exponentiation. This will just return the number, which may have leading zero bits. How many depends on chance, (somewhat) on the value of the modulus and if signed or unsigned encoding is used.

I am now trying to implement encryption using the pycryptodome module. I am using Salsa20 to transfer normal messages and to transfer the Salsa20 key I am using RSA. The problem is that the code is raising a ValueError when verifying the hash. This is the protocol:

The client connects to the server (and generates a Salsa20 key)
The server generates an RSA key pair and sends the public key to the client
The client generates its own key pair and sends the public key
The client encrypts the Salsa20 key with the public key
The client signs and sends a hash of the encrypted Salsa20 key
The client sends the encrypted Salsa20 key
The server hashes the unsigned encrypted key, and verifies that it is the same as the signed one (this is the line where the problem happens)

To get a public key:
gpg --export --no-armor 0123ABCD | openpgp2pem 0123ABCD

To get a secret key using openpgp2pem, unfortunately the GPG key must have its passphrase removed. Do this by:
gpg --edit-key 0123ABCD

Then use the passwd command to remove its passphrase. (You could do this on a copy of the original GPG homedir, and use the gpg --homedir option to operate on the temporary copy.)
Then after that you can do:

    with open(out_secret_filename, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(key_secret_export)

"37721113","JSEncrypt to PyCrypto RSA encryption not possible","I'm trying to encrypt a string in Javascript using RSA (public key)
And I want to decrypt that string in Python (2.7) with my private key.
The Libraries I am using are JSEncrypt and PyCrypto
The Problem here is, that PyCrypto has problems to decrypt the encrypted string
This part encrypts the string:
var encrypted = new JSEncrypt();
encrypted.setPublicKey(key); // key == '-----BEGIN PUBLIC'.....
encrypted = encrypted.encrypt('test');

The produced encrypted String looks like this:
HJuyZtuUbR4EvjZp0pirbEw0OX8KD7UDNyvSMx3plfzYPjV7r8RBOkouCkvPBG2XOF6E5lPr0ukWClF0u5HB8M6qF8b9xTMnM/j5e41iaPa/oIZyL0JC4h+FZ7cv/P6ygmaSafQ1xc96JltTbuW3u/YYdwmv/01CnFyaIEWW3gk=
This part should decrypt it:
private_rsa_key = open('rsa_1024_priv.pem', 'r').read()
rsa_key = RSA.importKey(private_rsa_key)
decrypted = rsa_key.decrypt(b64decode(encrypted_string))

The result now should be 'test', but indeed it is:

The correct string is always being placed at the end, but i need to get rid of the part before it.
For testing purposes I tried encrypting the String in Python, using this code:
public_rsa_key = open('rsa_1024_pub.pem', 'r').read()
rsa_key = RSA.importKey(public_rsa_key)
encrypted = rsa_key.encrypt('test', 'x')

which perfectly turns out 'test' when decrypting, but looks quite different encrypted:
('\x0bY\x1ckk\x7f\xd6\xda$\x05g\xa0\x0bxI\x0cO9\x8b?>M#X\xd2_[\xb7\xf1\xd0f\xb4\x92C\x01z\xa4\x02q\xb9\xb1\x80\x82\xe8\xe4\\E\x85\xa7r\xff\x1aIL,\xd8\xce\xaf\xef\xb4)\x84\x92]\xabA\xc9+\xd6\xef}\x08\xce\xe8\x97\xf8}\x84(\xb3\x9c\xfe7g\xe0\x869\x8b\xe8\xf8\xdf\x85}\xb0\x87\x1a2\xab\xda\xca\xfd\x81\xc0\x98\x12y\x92\x13\xd6\xa5a\xf3\x9aU\xb5\xa4d\xb8\xfc\xa3\xd1\xe2<\x07\xda\xc3\x9e\xc2',)

I am wondering why this encrypted text is now a tuple, with hex inside. As in my opinion the encrypted string from JS looks correct. How could I get PyCrypto to correctly decrypt the string?
Thanks in advance
","The python code you posted only does the low level decryption, the encrypted data returned by the jsencrypt also contains pkcs1 padding.
Instead of using the raw RSA key to encrypt/decrypt in your python code, you need to use the appropriate cipher, in this case PKCS1_v1_5:
...
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_v1_5
private_rsa_key = open('rsa_1024_priv.pem', 'r').read()
rsa_key = RSA.importKey(private_rsa_key)
cipher = PKCS1_v1_5.new(rsa_key)
decrypted = cipher.decrypt(encrypted, ""ERROR"")

The same applies when encrypting with the public key.

","As Java defaults to ""PKCS#5Padding"" it is pretty safe to assume you have to deal with those padding bytes (one to blocksize - in this case 16 - bytes are always padded). The Java ""PKCS#5Padding"" padding mode is actually PKCS#7 padding, as PKCS#5 only specifies padding for 8 byte blocks (e.g. DES mode encryption).
So this means you have to look for PKCS#5 padding or PKCS#7 padding. A quick search shows this answer.

","If you want to preserve the length, then you want to use a stream cipher
Note that both parties need to know key (secret) and initialization vector (not secret, but must be unique).
It is not safe to reuse same key without a different IV, thus you'd need to communicate new IV across somehow, which effectively lengthens your encrypted package.
Furthermore, you really need to consider replay attacks -- what happens if someone intercepts your message and then sends it again and again.
Here's simple example for RC4, using pycrypto, no IV (RC4 doesn't support it):
import Crypto.Cipher.ARC4
plaintext = ""x"" * 13
c1 = Crypto.Cipher.ARC4.new(key=""1"")
ciphertext = c.encrypt(plaintext)

How to import them as a command line argument ?
","When you execute

$ python3 encrypt.py '-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIG...'

the shell does not interpret \n as newline escapes, but as literal backslash+n, and that's what your program sees within sys.argv[1].
You can have newlines within en escaped shell string, so this should work:

$ python3 encrypt.py '-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCaIRYO3hxr0ObcYcgKtxFequ6p

If you really want to use a string with escapes, you can either handle the escapes yourself in your program by doing input_key = sys.argv[1].replace('\\n', '\n'), or let the shell do the escaping e.g by passing the string through echo: $ python3 encrypt.py ""$(echo -ne '-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIG...')"".

What I am trying to do is to replicate how counter-mode decryption works. As I understand the process, I should be able to xor my cipher text against the encryption of my IV and this should yield the plain text. (note that my cipher text = 16 bytes = one block, so no padding or incrementing of the IV is necessary here, I believe.)
No matter how I do this, I don't get anything legible to output. I think that my problem is how I am encrypting my IV, but I don't know for sure. I've been attacking this forever, but I'm getting nowhere. Can anyone see what I am doing wrong? Here's the code that I wrote:

","I get this question a lot when doing security consulting. No best practice, but it's all about managing the risk.
Storing credentials in user config file (e.g. ~/.secret or ~/.config) is a common practice. You can set file permission to 0600 so no other user (except superusers) can read it.
Or, you can pass the credentials in the environment. Best if you do it from remote connection (SSH), but you have to manually login and pass the variables every time you restart the application.
Also make sure the database user has very limited privilege.

However, wile the first verification will always return true, once the data is written to files and then loaded again, the verification usually fails, but is sometimes successful.
Even when the code fails, The outputs of the two print signature and print hash.hexdigest() calls are visually identical.
My test code  is:
from Crypto.Hash import SHA256
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Signature import PKCS1_PSS
def generate():
    key_file = open(""TestPrivateKey"")
    private_key = RSA.importKey(key_file)
    public_key = private_key.publickey()

    seed_file = open(""Seed"")

    plaintext = seed_file.read()

    hash = SHA256.new(plaintext)
    signer = PKCS1_PSS.new(private_key)
    signature =  signer.sign(hash)

    plaintext_file = open(""plaintext"", 'w')

from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

def create_keys():
    private_key = RSA.generate(4096)
    file = open(""TestPrivateKey"", 'w')
    file.write(private_key.exportKey())

    file.write(private_key.publickey().exportKey())

def create_seed():
    file = open(""Seed"", 'w')
    file.write(""Test"")

","I notice two problems with your code.
First, you are writing arbitrary binary data to a file what was opened for text:
signature_file = open(""signature"", 'w')  #bad
signature_file.write(signature)

should be:
signature_file = open(""signature"", 'wb')  #good
signature_file.write(signature)

Second, you never close your files. Try this:
with open(""signature"", 'wb') as signature_file:
    signature_file.write(signature)

and similarly for all of the other open files.

eric@eric-Latitude-E5400 ~ $ dpkg -L udev | xargs grep urandom
/lib/udev/rules.d/50-udev-default.rules:KERNEL==""null|zero|full|random|urandom"", MODE=""0666""
eric@eric-Latitude-E5400 ~ $ ls -lart /dev/*random
crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1, 9 Jun 29 10:53 /dev/urandom
crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1, 8 Jun 29 10:53 /dev/random

So it looks like my permissions are fine. I have also tried running the development server as root, but I get the same error. For some reason this only happens with the development server, and not when deployed to google's cloud. Any ideas on what to try next?
Thanks!
","The error you are getting is because GAE restricts file access, and /dev/urandom is blocked.
Note that the error is not when you import PyCrypto, it's when you do AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
You can fix it, either by editing Crypto/Random/OSRNG/__init__.py  and moving the lines
if hasattr(os, 'urandom'):
    from Crypto.Random.OSRNG.fallback import new

to the top, or by modifying os.name to something different than posix or nt, at the beginning of your script. I suggest the first option.
ps: I assume you are using python 2.5 and pycrypto 2.2, because of your Traceback. Next time please include these details.

","ok, first: long in python is not 4 byte. in python, long has no predefined size, so using a long to store a 128byte number is no problem.
to convert a bytestring to long you can use:
long_value = long(string_value.decode('hex'), 16)
# maybe someone knows a better way?

couldn't it be that the file is in DER form? in that case you simply could simple read the file using:
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
with open(""keyfile"", ""rb"") as f:
    key = RSA.importKey(f.read())

if not, it would probably be best to convert it to PEM or DER, so you don't have to read in the parameters yourself.
anyway, the last three parameters in RSA.construct are optional, specially u can be calculated as 1/p % q (where p > q).
at least from what i've tried, it works even if you only specify the first three parameters.

I read on the forums that this is likely an issue between my Ubuntu system (14.04 LTS) and Python (2.7.9) but the weird thing was when I recompiled python with --enable-encoding=usc2, I got the same error on the same line but instead of saying ""undefined symbol: PyUnicodeUCS2_Decode"" it simply said ""undefined symbol: PyUnicodeUCS4_Decode"". This leads me to believe the problem may be something else and I'm not sure how to proceed.
","I'm not sure if this will solve the problem.
Instead of putting in the json file itself, can you try entering the client_email and private key like this.
The client_email can be copied as such. For the private key, do this instead:
key = u""-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nBLABLA_\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"".encode(""utf-8"")


credentials = SignedJwtAssertionCredentials(client_email,key,scope)

","In your decryption routine you use:
 unhexed.split('|')

to find the boundary between IV and the ciphertext. However, the IV is generated randomly by the sender. Sometimes, one of its 16 bytes will be 124, that is the boundary character '|'.
When that happens (in roughly 6% of the cases), the decryption routine will initialize the cipher either with

an IV with length between 1 and 15 bytes, which leads to the exception, or
an IV with length 0, which leads to the incorrect decryption, because in PyCrypto versions<2.6 an all-zero 16 byte IV will be used by default

In the decryption routine you should have instead:
components = [ unhexed[:AES.block_size], unhexed[AES.block_size+1:] ]

Or you could get rid of the '|' separator altogether.

this is my RSA code
def generate_keys():
    key = RSA.generate(1024)
    private_key = key.exportKey(format='PEM', pkcs=8, 
                  protection=""scryptAndAES128-CBC"")
    f = open(""private_key.pem"", ""wb"")
    f.write(private_key)
    public_key = key.publickey().exportKey('PEM')
    f = open(""public_key.pem"", ""wb"")

    f.close()

def encrypt(username, msg):
    #get the reciever's public key
    f = open(""{}.pem"".format(username)) # a.salama.pem

    f.close()

    # Encrypt the session key with the reciever's public RSA key

    cipher_aes.nonce + tag +  ciphertext    
    encrypted_data = base64.b64encode(encrypted_data)
    return encrypted_data

And after trying to use ECC+AES the code will be
from Crypto.PublicKey import ECC
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes
from Crypto.Cipher import AES, PKCS1_OAEP
import base64

def generate_keys():
    key = ECC.generate(curve='P-256') #3072 RSA

    f.close()

    public_key = key.public_key().export_key(format='PEM')
    f = open('public_key.pem','wt')
    f.write(public_key)
    f.close()

def encrypt(username, msg):

    cipher_aes.nonce + tag +  ciphertext    
    encrypted_data = base64.b64encode(encrypted_data)

    return encrypted_data.decode()

This gives me error in this line
cipher_rsa = PKCS1_OAEP.new(recipient_key)

but i want to encrypt the session key with the public key, how to do this with pycryptodome or any other way
","Pycryptodome does not support elliptic curve-based encryption (ECC encryption).
Use the ECIES algorithm instead, e.g. this Python library: https://github.com/kigawas/eciespy
The ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme) is hybrid encryption scheme, which combines ECC public-key cryptography to asymmetrically encrypt a session key, used later to encrypt the input data with a symmetric cipher (e.g. with AES-GCM).

"11642337","Pycrypto: Incrementing AES Counter Mode","I'm really confused about how to do AES decryption in pycrypto using counter mode. As I understand the process, if I start with a known IV to decrypt the first block, then for each successive block, I have to increment the IV. But I don't get how to do this. 
Also, I am totally new to python, as you will readily see. My problem lies somewhere in how I am implementing my class and how I am calling it from the decryptor.
Here is the code that I have written thus far:
class IVCounter(object):
    def incrIV(self):
        return self[:15] + chr(ord(self[15:]) + 1)

def decryptCTR(key, ciphertext):

    #convert the key into a 16 byte string
    key = array.array('B', key.decode(""hex"")).tostring()

    #convert the iv into a 16 byte string
    iv = array.array('B', iv.decode(""hex"")).tostring()

    print AES.new(key, mode, counter=IVCounter.incrIV(iv)).decrypt(ciphertext)
    return

Here is the error that I get:

TypeError: unbound method incrIV() must be called with IVCounter instance as first argument (got str instance instead)

No matter what I try, I can't get this to work. Can somebody help straighten me out?
Thanks!
","class IVCounter(object):
    @staticmethod
    def incrIV(arry):
        return arry[:15] + chr(ord(arry[15:]) + 1)

It's complaining because it expects the first argument to be an instance. Turn that off with the staticmethod decorator.

","As it stands there is no way for us to really critique your code per se.  However to re-use logins, my recommendation is to simply hit the same routines that Django uses, porting them to a new language or framework as necessary.  This means you have a single point of authority regarding security.
Note you cannot use SHA hashed passwords (any algorithm) with PostgreSQL per se because PostgreSQL stores the passwords as md5 hashes salted with the username.  Unless you have access to the unhashed username you cannot alter the PostgreSQL user account effectively.   You might however be able to write a function which both changes the PostgreSQL and Django password from the same inputs but you need to be careful about statement logging.  Also note that ALTER USER is not parameterized in PostgreSQL so you end up having to use pl/pgsql and do something like:
  EXECUTE $e$ ALTER USER $e$ || quote_ident(in_username) || $e$ WITH PASSWORD $e$ 
      || quote_literal(in_password);

I have tried installing it on local machine and then moving the package from site-packages to target location but it does not works.
Any other options.

","Yes there is a way my friend, you need to download first the packages and dependency of them to a folder and use pip package manager with a requirements file  like this:
pip install --no-index --find-links=[file://] -r requirements.txt
and if you want to download all the packages first in one hit use this:
pip install --download  -r requirements.txt

","In the Sun JCE, RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Paddingactually means Hash=SHA256 and MGF1 using SHA1. Pycrypto*, on the other hand, assumes MGF1+SHA256 when Hash=SHA256.
You will need to configure Pycrypto* accordingly by passing the correct Hash mechanism to the the MGF1 function:
from Cryptodome.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP
from Cryptodome.Hash import SHA256, SHA1
from Cryptodome.Signature import pss

cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(key=self.key, hashAlgo=SHA256, mgfunc=lambda x,y: pss.MGF1(x,y, SHA1))
ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(cek)

It's worth noting that according to breaking down RSA/ECB/OAEPWITHSHA-256ANDMGF1PADDING, BouncyCastle uses SHA256 for both the Hash and MGF1 in the same way Pycrypto* does.

","This is because cipher.encrypt(plain_text) in python 3.x returns a byte string.
The example given in the page uses python 2.x in which case cipher.encrypt(plain_text) returned a regular string.
You can verify the same by using the type function:
In python 3.x:
>>> type(cipher.encrypt(""ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP""))
<class 'bytes'>

In python 2.x

A chunk of the data has been encrypted in AES with the ECB mode -- however the key length is only 10. I am able to decrypt the data successfully.
However, I need to use Python in the later stages of the project and consequently need to decrypt my data using it. I tried employing PyCrypto but it tells me the key length must be 16, 24 or 32 bytes long, which is not the case. According to the phpseclib documentation the ""keys are null-padded to the closest valid size"", but I'm not sure how to implement that in Python. Simply extending the length of the string with 6 spaces is not working.
What should I do?
","I strongly recommend you adjust your PHP code to use (at least) a sixteen byte key, otherwise your crypto system is considerably weaker than it might otherwise be.
I would also recommend you switch to CBC-mode, as ECB-mode may reveal patterns in your input data. Ensure you use a random IV each time you encrypt and store this with the ciphertext.
Finally, to address your original question:

According to the phpseclib documentation the ""keys are null-padded to the closest valid size"", but I'm not sure how to implement that in Python. Simply extending the length of the string with 6 spaces is not working.

The space character 0x20 is not the same as the null character 0x00.

    iv = md5(sign).hexdigest()[::-2]

It is very confuse to me because I used the same KEY and IV.
I want to establish a API-SYSTEM, I need others post their cryptographic data no matter which language they used, just want to get the same result in AES.
How can I get the stable result in using AES?
I mean I want to get the same result when I using the same KEY and IV to encrypt the same plaintext.
","The AES implementation in pycrypto is a stateful for the CBC mode. This statefulness can be simulated by the IV value. Let's assume that raw is shorter than 16 bytes for simplicity.
In that case the code
raw += (16 - len(raw) % 16) * '\0'
generator = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV=iv)

print generator.encrypt(raw) # result_1
print generator.encrypt(raw) # result_2
print generator.encrypt(raw) # result_3

is equivalent to 
raw += (16 - len(raw) % 16) * '\0'
generator = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV=iv)
ct1 = generator.encrypt(raw) 
print ct1 # result_1

generator = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV=ct1)
ct2 = generator.encrypt(raw) 
print ct2 # result_2

generator = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV=ct2)
ct3 = generator.encrypt(raw) 
print ct3 # result_3

The reason is that the IV is advanced internally according to the definition of the CBC mode. It means that the IV is set to the last full ciphertext block.
If raw is assumed to be any length, then the following would be equivalent where only the last block of the ciphertext is used as the IV for the next encryption:
raw += (16 - len(raw) % 16) * '\0'
generator = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV=iv)
ct1 = generator.encrypt(raw) 
print ct1 # result_1

generator = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV=ct1[-16:])
ct2 = generator.encrypt(raw) 
print ct2 # result_2

generator = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV=ct2[-16:])
ct3 = generator.encrypt(raw) 
print ct3 # result_3

If you don't want that, then you need to initialize the generator with the original IV.

","You have at least three issues:

You probably mean hashlib.sha256(encPW.encode('UTF-8')).digest() instead of hashlib.sha256(encPW.encode('UTF-8').digest()) (the closing brace is at the wrong position)
You're encoding the ciphertext with Base64 before writing it to a file. You've forgot to decode it after reading it back from the file before decrypting it. For example:
getBytes = base64.b64decode(bytes(selFile.read()))

This is the big one: You need the exact same IV during the decryption that you've used for encryption. The IV is not secret, but it needs to be unique for every encryption that you've done with the same key. Commonly the IV is written in front of the ciphertext and read back for decryption.

    iv, encrypted = contents.split(b"":"")

    decrypted = aes.decrypt(contents)
    with open(outpath, ""wb"") as f:
        f.write(decrypted)
    print(""Decryption successful"")

Some notes:

An IV is not meant to be secret, so it can be randomly generated once and then written to a file to be used later for decryption (as shown in this example)
A hashing algorithm is not strong enough for deriving keys, which is why there are special tools called key derivation algorithms (like PBKDF2 in python). Use those instead!

I have not tested this code myself, so it may not work properly.

When I try to encrypt a file with PyCrypto.  I can encrypt and decrypt it (only works with images so far).  The problem is that the image becomes corrupted when I encrypt it and try to open it.  How can I fix it so I can still run the program or see the image when it's been encrypted?
Here is the encryption code:
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Hash import SHA256
from Crypto import Random
import os

def Encryption(Key, filename):
    chunksize = 64*1024
    outputFile = ""[CryptoReady]""+filename

    with open(outputFile, 'wb') as outfile:
        outfile.write(filesize.encode('utf-8'))

","When you encrypt a file, its contents are run through an algorithm and the contents are changed. If your file is a JPEG, its headers are also changed causing it to look-like corrupt if you try to open it using file viewers.
However, what's happening behind the scenes is they have just been transformed from X to let's say Y. To bring it back and have your image viewer easily open it, you will need to run the file thorough a decryption algorithm using the appropriate keys. That way your Y type will be transformed back exactly to X type and you will be able to read it.

Now, I want to connect to the server with xmlrpc based remote API. To do this I installed ezPyCrypto which is advised by many as an easy to use python encryption library. To test the encryption I wrote the following code:
mypass = ""xxx""
fd = open(""Putty-Private.ppk"")
pubprivkey = fd.read()
fd.close()
k = ezPyCrypto.key(pubprivkey, passphrase = mypass)
dec = k.decString(enc)

But the system gives the following error in ezPyCrypto.key(...) invocation:

I am sure that passphrase is correct. So, I guess I cannot use the private key generator by Putty in ezPyCrypto. Is that right? What is the explanation for the reason of this error?
","The .ppk extension makes me guess the private key comes from ""Save private key"" in puttygen. This file format is not supported by pretty much anything except PuTTY itself.

The pycrypto_keys library referenced there can be found here for reference of the specific implementation of the functions generate_rsa_public_and_private and create_rsa_signature.
My Go test consists of 2 simple files that only rely on core packages. First the verification function, in verify.go:
package example

import (
    ""crypto""
    ""crypto/rsa""
    ""crypto/sha256""
    ""crypto/x509""
    ""fmt""
)

func Verify(key []byte, sig []byte, msg []byte) error {
    digest := sha256.Sum256(msg)

    pub, err := x509.ParsePKIXPublicKey(key)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf(""Failed to parse key"")
    }

    rsaPub, ok := pub.(*rsa.PublicKey)
    if !ok {
        return fmt.Errorf(""Invalid value returned from ParsePKIXPublicKey"")
    }

    opts := rsa.PSSOptions{SaltLength: 16, Hash: crypto.SHA256}
    if err = rsa.VerifyPSS(rsaPub, crypto.SHA256, digest[:], sig, &opts); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf(""Failed Verification"")
    }
    return nil
}

And second, a test case. The key pair and signature were generated using the Python commands at the top and copied in here to create a static set of parameters to use for compatibility testing.

Much thanks for any help.
","So it appears I misinterpreted _SALT_SIZE in the Python code. With some help from the TUF developers (i.e. they told me) I discovered PyCrypto's RSA PSS code infers the salt size to be equal to the size of the hash digest of the hashing algorithm in use. In this case it was 32 bytes as the hashing algorithm was Sha256. With just the change of opts := rsa.PSSOptions{SaltLength: 32, Hash: crypto.SHA256} the code works.

"16389790","Add salt to pycrypto KDF - useful?","I have noted some sources indicate that when using a KDF like PBKDF2 some advocate injecting the salt at the time of execution - like this:
dv = salt + PBKDF2(salt + password, salt)

Versus the ""plain"" usage of
dv = PBKDF2(password, salt)

When using the PyCrypto.Protocol.KDF PBKDF2 function (linked above), do the extra salt parameters add any benefit if no two passwords will have the same salt (but the salt will be stored with the password)?
Presumably the risk is having an oracle whereby identical passwords would be revealed as-such, encoded. Is this the case or is there another concern one ought to be mindful of?
If this is the only concern I would expect, in the absence of a fault in the algorithms that permits short-circuiting, a plainly used salt obliges one to recheck every password the entire number of iterations. Is this the case?

"8261535","Decrypt a a middle chunk of data using pycrypto AES or other algorithm","I was looking for a way to use an encryption algorithm from pycrypto package that allows me to encrypt an original LARGE piece of data, and then decrypt only a MIDDLE chunk of this data. In other words, start decrypting the data at a certain offset, instead of starting to decrypt it at offset 0.
I've tried AES, as you can see below. But, it only allows me to properly decrypt the data if I go from beg of the enrypted data to the part I really need to decrypt, instead of just decrypting a middle chunk of data (of course with the proper key), and skip decrypting parts before this middle chunk. This is important in saving time and processing power. Let's say you have an original data that is 4GB. At some point in time, you only need the data from offset 3GB-3.5GB. Decrypting a whole 2GB of data to get to the 1GB chunk that you need is a waste of time and resources...
Is this the nature of all encryption/decryption algorithms? Perhaps you can recommend something that does what I want? That works with a key and is pretty secure..
    from Crypto.Cipher import AES

key = '0123456789abcdef' #16 chars
mode = AES.MODE_CBC

e = AES.new(key, mode)

orig = 'hellohowareyousuhellohowareyousu' #32 chars
print len(orig)

a = e.encrypt(orig)
print len(a)

d = AES.new(key, mode)

#works
print d.decrypt(a[:16]) #aes requires encrypt/decrypt 16 chars at a time
print d.decrypt(a[16:])

#doesn't work
print d.decrypt(a[16:])

","You are using CBC (ciphertext block chaining) mode, in which the message is split up into blocks and the output of one block used to encrypt the next. This is fundamentally a sequential operation; to decrypt, you must also work through the ciphertext sequentially.
If you use CTR (counter) mode, you can have random access.

To avoid creating a process everytime you want to run your Python script, you can implement server-client architecture using sockets to communicate between Python and PHP. Server being your crypto library in your case and client is your PHP script that queries the server.

Python sockets doc: https://docs.python.org/2/howto/sockets.html
PHP sockets doc: http://php.net/manual/en/book.sockets.php

It essentially means that your Python script is a long-running script (to avoid the cost of creating it again and again).

Using pycrypto, same thing with RSA works just fine:
key.publickey().exportKey('OpenSSH')

Unfortunately, There is no exportKey() func for a DSA object.
I also have a similar issue with an ecdsa key. Bottom line, I need a python equivalent (for both DSA and ecdsa) to:
ssh-keygen -y -f /path/to/private_key > /path/to/public_key

","The expression:

from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto import Random
def decrypt(in_file, out_file, pwd, key_len=32):
    bs = AES.block_size
    salt = in_file.read(bs)[len('Salted__'):]
    key, iv = derive_keyiv(pwd, salt, key_len, bs)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    next_chunk = ''
    finished = False
    try:
        while not finished:
            chunk, next_chunk = next_chunk, cipher.decrypt(in_file.read(1024*bs))

But if the password input error, the decrypt still decrypt in_file and write to out_file and no exception throw.
How to check the password error during decrypt?
","AES by itself cannot check if the key is ""correct"". It is simply a pure function that transforms some bytes to some other bytes.
To achieve what you want, you need to implement it yourself. One way to do is to add a fixed header (like 16 bytes of zero) to the plaintext before encryption. Upon decryption, check and discard the said header if it matches or raise an error if the header mismatches.
A side note: you are doing encryption without any authentication, which is probably insecure.
Edit
First of all, you should add authentication. Encryption without authentication easily leads to many security flaws, many not obvious to the untrained. Especially since you are using AES in CBC mode, you may open yourself to padding oracle attacks without authentication.
When you do authenticated encryption the right way (encrypt-then-mac), you will get an authentication error if the user input the wrong password. If you want to further distinguish a wrong password from tampered data, you have to devise your own method, like prepending a ciphertext of magic number.

    return cipher.decrypt(enc_txt)

Output is: ""�增��""j�����""t string, lorem ipsum""
Expected output: ""This is my secret string, lorem ipsum""
I tried to find the problem, when I used the keyBytes and IV generated by the C# RFC2898DeriveBytes method that also works fine python code but python code is not decrypting the whole message correctly using the PBKDF2 
generated keyBytes and IV.
Both C# RFC2898DeriveBytes and python PBKDF2 are generating keyBytes using HMACSHA1 hashing algo but C# RFC2898DeriveBytes method is generated different keyBytes and IV whereas Python PBKDF2 is returning first 16 bytes of generated keyBytes for IV call.
Kindly give me some helpful guidelines on this.
Thanks,

","Rfc2898DeriveBytes is a streaming-response object, so concatenating two successive calls is the same as doing one call with both lengths added together.
var pbkdf2WithTwoCalls = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(...)
var pbkdf2WithOneCall = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(sameParametersAsAbove);

byte[] twoCallA = pbkdf2WithTwoCalls.GetBytes(32);
byte[] twoCallB = pbkdf2WithTwoCalls.GetBytes(16);

byte[] oneCall = pbkdf2WithOneCall.GetBytes(32 + 16);

if (!oneCall.SequenceEquals(twoCallA.Concat(twoCallB))

So your solution in Python would be to make one 48-byte call to PBKDF2, then split it into the 32-byte AES key and the 16-byte IV.
Your decryption response indicates that the key is correct, but the IV is not.

I get that AES is a block cipher algorithm. However, how should I fix my PHP code so that it generates ""padded"" cipher, any clues?
","The main issue here is that you're using different key-size. PHP's openssl_encrypt determines the key size from the encryption algorithm string  (""aes-256-cbc"" in this case) so it expects a 256 bit key. If the key is shorter it is padded with zero bytes, so the actual key used by openssl_encrypt is:  
""akshayakshayaksh\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0""

Pycryptodome determines the key size from the actual size of the key, so your Python code uses AES-128-CBC. Also, as mentioned in the coments by kelalaka, the ciphertext is base64 encoded (openssl_encrypt base64-encodes the ciphertext by default - we can get raw bytes if we use OPENSSL_RAW_DATA in $options). Pycryptodome doesn't decode the ciphertext, so we must use b64decode().  
key = b'akshayakshayaksh\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0'
obj2 = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, b'0123456789012345')
ciphertext = b""cUXDhOEGz19QEo9XDvMzXkGFmg/YQUnXEqKVpfYtUGo=""
print(obj2.decrypt(b64decode(ciphertext)))
#b'message to be encrypted\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'

The extra \t characters at the end is the padding - CBC requires padding. Pycryptodome doesn't remove padding automatically but it provides padding functions in Crypto.Util.Padding.  
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import unpad
from base64 import b64decode

key = b'akshayakshayaksh\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0'

plaintext = obj2.decrypt(b64decode(ciphertext))
plaintext = unpad(plaintext, AES.block_size)


Although PHP's openssl accepts arbitrary sized keys, it's best to use key size specified in the algorithm string, to prevent confusion at the very least. Also the key bytes should be as random as possible.  
As noted by Maarten Bodewes in the comments this key uses a limited range of bytes and so it's very weak. Furthermore it is created by repeating a word and that makes it vulnerable to dictionary attacks (which are much faster than bruteforce attacks).  
In PHP we can get cryptographically secure random bytes with random_bytes(), 
$key = random_bytes(32);  

and in Python with os.urandom()
key = os.urandom(32)

(You can use the same functions to create the IV; you shouldn't use a static IV, the IV must be unpredictable)  
You could also derive a key from your password with a KDF. In this case it is important to use a random salt and a high enough number of iterations. PHP provies a PBKDF2 algorithm with the hash_pbkdf2 function, and Python with hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac.

"36772305","Web Crypto API JWK usage in Python","I am developing a P2P Infrastructure that will have data from a set of different applications, distributed through the network. This P2P overlay is composed by a set of Python Twisted Servers. 
I need to guarantee the security and privacy of the stored data, for each user of each application. Consequently, I am generating pairs of RSA keys in the client side of the web app, using the Web Crypto API. The RSA key pairs will be stored in the P2P overlay as well. So, I cipher on the client side, the private keys with a derivation of the user password.
In addition, I am using jwk to pem module to convert the JWK public key into a PEM key, to be used in the Python Cryptography library (PyCrypt or m2Crypto).
Finally, I have to guarantee that the message containing those credentials, as well as the user data , maintain its integrity. Therefore, in the client side, I am signing this data with the user's private key.
I send the data, as well as the signature, both in ArrayBuffer type to the server, encoded in base64. 
function signData(private_key, data, callback){

    var dataForHash = str2ab(JSON.stringify(sortObject(data)));
    computeSHA(dataForHash, ""SHA-256"", function(hash){


        signRSA(private_key, hash, function(data){      
            callback(data.buffer.b64encode(), dataForHash.b64encode());
        });    
    });
}

function computeSHA(data, mode, callback){
    window.crypto.subtle.digest(
        {
            name: mode,
        },
        data
    )
    .then(function(hash){
        callback(new Uint8Array(hash).buffer);
    })
    .catch(function(err){
        console.error(err);
    });
}

function signRSA(private_key, data, callback){

        console.error(err);
    });
}

ArrayBuffer.prototype.b64encode = function(){
    return btoa(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, new Uint8Array(this)));
};

Afterwards, when the Python Server receives this http request, it decodes data and signature from base64. 
dataForHash = base64.b64decode(dataReceived['data'])
signature = base64.b64decode(dataReceived['signature'])

For validating the signature, the public key is needed. Consequently:
data = utils.byteify(json.loads(dataForHash.decode(""utf-16"")))
pub_key = base64.b64decode(data['pub_key']) # Get PEM Public Key

(utils.byteify() converts unicode string to regular strings)
Verifying signature:
Authentication.verifySignature(signature, dataForHash, pub_key)

Method definition:
from Crypto.Signature import PKCS1_v1_5
from Crypto.Hash import SHA256
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

def verifySignature(signature, data, pub_key):
    key = RSA.importKey(pub_key)
    h = SHA256.new(data)
    verifier = PKCS1_v1_5.new(key)
    return verifier.verify(h, signature)

However, the signature verification returns False. I have also tried to use the m2crypto library, but it returns 0. 
","I managed to find the problem.
Although in Python (PyCrypto) the sign function should receive the hash of the data to sign, using the Web Cryptography API, the sign method applies a hash function to the received data before signing it. 
Consequently, the data in JS was being hashed twice, one before invoking the sign method and one in the sign method, before creating the signature.
function signData(private_key, data, callback){

    var dataForHash = str2ab(JSON.stringify(sortObject(data)));

    signRSA(private_key, dataForHash, function(data){           

        callback(data.buffer.b64encode(), dataForHash.b64encode());
    });    
}

ArrayBuffer.prototype.b64encode = function(){
    return btoa(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, new Uint8Array(this)));
};

String.prototype.b64decode = function(){
    var binary_string = window.atob(this);
    var len = binary_string.length;
    var bytes = new Uint8Array(new ArrayBuffer(len));
    for (var i = 0; i < len; i++)        {
        bytes[i] = binary_string.charCodeAt(i);
    }
    return bytes;
};

With this modification, the verification in python returns True now.

    cipher.decrypt(ByteArray(_content));

cipher.decrypt(ByteArray(com.hurlant.util.Base64.decodeToByteArray(_content)));  

Another suspicion is that I have not appropriately removed 'padding' from the _content / set up my IV appropriately (which is specified by the padding I must remove from the _content). This should be done via that ""simple"" statement however.  I have been trying this, but with no success:
var pad:IPad = new PKCS5

pad.setBlockSize(cipher.getBlockSize());

Could anyone advise on how I can fix this ? :)

For small strings, like ""hello world!"", the encryption/decryption works fine.
But I would like to extend the encryption to text files of any reasonable size, but I've been running into this error:
ValueError: Input strings must be a multiple of 16 in length
I understand that this is because AES-256 is a block cipher, and so the texts need to be in multiples of 16 bytes, and if bytes are big, then I need to chunk them.
My question is, how do I exactly go about doing that? Is there a built-in pycrypto method for it? I'm quite new to cryptography, so I don't think I'd be able to write a chunking method on my own.
Here's how I pad/unpad the string to be encrypted (from https://gist.github.com/gustavohenrique/79cc95cc351d975a075f18a5c9f49319):

Follow the instructions here to use 4.2 instead of 4.1 as the version of gcc.

Try his:
sudo apt-get install python-pip

sudo pip install StarCluster

Then you can start python and import starcluster:
python
import starcluster

You can do the same with pycrypto:

"41943147","Decrypt RSA based encryption using Apache NiFi","I am using a python script that uses pycrypto to encrypt files using RSA. I have used encrypt(data, 2048) function during encryption.
Now, I am trying to decrypt that encrypted file using the decrypt processor in Apache NiFi and I am not sure which KDF and Encryption Algorithm to select.
I do not see anything termed RSA in the Configure Processor window of Apache NiFi.
","Currently, the EncryptContent processor does not support arbitrary RSA decryption. I would suggest you file a Jira requesting this enhancement (don't be scared by the graph showing a discrepancy between opened & closed; we're currently at the phase of the lifecycle where a release went out recently and now all the feedback is generating new tickets for the next release). 
For immediate solutions, I have a few suggestions:

You can use GPG to encrypt and decrypt the data, and NiFi provides first-class support for GPG decryption. The GPG key uses an underlying DSA/RSA key alongside AES encryption for the data, so this would be effectively the same process (asymmetric encryption). 
You can use the ExecuteScript processor to run a small script which performs the decryption. The processor supports Ruby, Groovy, Lua, Javascript, and Python*. Unfortunately the limitation on Python is that Jython doesn't support native libraries (such as pycrypto). One possible solution is to use JyNI which allows Jython to load CPython libraries, but I have not evaluated it in this context. If you are comfortable with Groovy & BouncyCastle or Ruby & OpenSSL, you can write the decrypt script in either of those languages with only a few lines of code. 
If you really want to use the Python code you already have, you can invoke it on the command-line via ExecuteProcess or ExecuteStreamCommand. 

One outstanding question -- how are you using RSA to encrypt the files? RSA with a 2048 bit key length can only encrypt 245 bytes. If you are encrypting files, it is more likely you would want to use a hybrid cryptosystem, where you encrypt the arbitrary data with a randomly-generated AES key and then encrypt just that AES key with RSA. This will be much faster as well. This is the model used by SSL, S/MIME, OpenPGP, etc.

"14356471","Porting AES code from M2Crypto to pycrypto","I want to convert some existing AES code from M2Crypto to the equivalent pycrypto but the documentation is thin, especially for M2Crypto. I have reduced the relevant code to a gist. The main issues are:

Pycrypto requires the input to be multiple of 16 in length, m2crypto does not.
Even when the input length is multiple of 16, the ciphertext differs. After experimenting with M2Crypto cipher parameters, it turns out that setting padding and key_as_bytes to false encrypts to the same ciphertext with  pycrypto. So I need to emulate padding=True and key_as_bytes=True in pure python.

Any help would be much appreciated.
EDIT: Solved - the gist has been updated with the equivalent M2Crypto/pycrypto code and tests, I'll leave it there in case someone finds it useful in the future.
","You will have to implement PKCS#7 padding/unpadding, which is kind of simple and specified in the publicly available standard from RSA labs, and of course on Wikipedia. Also see this answer:

Note that PKCS#7 padding and PKCS#5 padding are identical, although the latter is officially only for 8 byte block ciphers (e.g. DES/TDEA). OpenSSL uses PKCS#7 padding by default.

","Please make sure that you understand about character-encoding and encoding.
Character encoding defines what text looks like if you represent it as bytes. There are many encoding standards, but the most common ones include ASCII, Windows-1252, UTF-8 and UTF-16. The first one is a limited single (7-bit) set, Windows-1252 contains mostly European/Latin characters and the latter two are encodings used for Unicode text. If a file is viewed in the wrong encoding then it may show like nonsense - but most text editors can guess the text encoding pretty well nowadays.
Note that not all - and sometimes even many - bytes can be interpreted as text in most encodings. Bytes may not represent a character at all, or it may encode (or encode part of) a control-character. It is possible to go around this issue by encoding your bytes as text. A common encoding uses hexadecimals. Each byte is encoded in exactly two characters, 4 bits per character. This makes it easy for programmers to see the contents of the bytes. Base64 on the other hand is not that legible as it encodes each 6 bits as a character. So base 64 is a more efficient encoding, but it is not very easy for humans to read.
Make sure you use a good character-encoding if you want your plaintext input to be legible. The ciphertext - despite the name - consists of bytes. If you want to create characters from that, use base 64.

"48595705","Cant encrypt strings with special characters with pycrypto AES","Description
I want to store people's names in MySQL database. Because the data is sensitive information i want to encrypt it with AES. I am using PyCrypto AES module.
The code that I am using is:
class AESCipher(object):

    def __init__(self, key):
        self.bs = 64
        self.key = hashlib.sha256(key.encode()).digest()

    def encrypt(self, raw):
        raw = self._pad(raw)
        iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
        cipher = AES.new(self.key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
        return base64.b64encode(iv + cipher.encrypt(raw))

    def decrypt(self, enc):
        enc = base64.b64decode(enc)
        iv = enc[:AES.block_size]
        cipher = AES.new(self.key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
        return self._unpad(cipher.decrypt(enc[AES.block_size:])).decode('utf-8')

    def _pad(self, s):
        return s + (self.bs - len(s) % self.bs) * chr(self.bs - len(s) % self.bs)

    @staticmethod
    def _unpad(s):
        return s[:-ord(s[len(s)-1:])]

operator = AESCipher(data_encryption_key)

The key used for encryption is a random long string.
Problem
Lets say the string (example name) i want to encrypt is ""Strah"". I get the folowing cipher text.
b'kA/Q5snPUHltzh3Kl8QMH/uTpfcjdXtvrx0JUrGv2tk+P86ERfkv0eTBV5j6MThkKplLLcn4f1Ei4Q1gT/FcVx+PhEnqczKhuvLzrLHYlQ4='

But if the name includes some special characters like č,š or ž and i want to encrypt a name like ""Štrah"" i will get the following error:
ValueError: Input strings must be a multiple of 16 in length

So the question is, what should I do to encrypt strings with special characters.
","The problem here is that the cipher internally operates on bytes, but you're giving it a string. You're padding the string to a multiple of 16, but when that string is encoded to bytes, it's no longer a multiple a 16.
>>> text = 'Štrah'
>>> padded = AESCipher('')._pad(raw)
>>> len(padded)
64
>>> len(padded.encode('utf8'))
65


The solution is to encode the string yourself instead of letting the cipher do it for you. You have to make 2 small changes:
def encrypt(self, raw):
    raw = raw.encode('utf8')  # encode to bytes here
    raw = self._pad(raw)
    iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
    cipher = AES.new(self.key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    return base64.b64encode(iv + cipher.encrypt(raw))

def _pad(self, s):
    # pad with bytes instead of str
    return s + (self.bs - len(s) % self.bs) * \
           chr(self.bs - len(s) % self.bs).encode('utf8')

","This is not the exact answer for the original question but this solved my problem:
Based on https://security.stackexchange.com/a/10953 

... public-key cryptography is expensive for large messages; the public key algorithm is only used to encrypt the symmetric key and to sign a digest of the file.

So it is not recommended to encrypt large data/files using RSA. Use AES instead:
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
obj = AES.new('This is a key123', AES.MODE_CBC, 'This is an IV456')
message = ""The answer is no""*32
ciphertext = obj.encrypt(message)
print(ciphertext)
# '\xd6\x83\x8dd!VT\x92\xaa`A\x05\xe0\x9b\x8b\xf1'
obj2 = AES.new('This is a key123', AES.MODE_CBC, 'This is an IV456')

Problem is that I can't seem to save the encrypted value to the database for the User model. For example:
user = User.objects.get(id=user_id)
cipher, iv = encrypt(user_value, user_key)
user.secret_value = cipher

I've been following the sample provided in their code here: https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/blob/master/lib/Crypto/Cipher/CAST.py
So I'm using mode.openPGP, but I can't seem to encrypt anything using a public key. My public key is well over the 16byte limit they specify (and any generation I've seen is over this limit as well). Is there a different value I'm supposed to use here, like the fingerprint ID? 
I'm trying to read the contents of a file, encrypt it with a key, then print it into a new file to be sent (both will be deleted later on).
My code is as follows:
iv = CryptoRandom.new().read(CAST.block_size)
cipher = CAST.new(public_key, CAST.MODE_OPENPGP, iv)
file = open(filename)
contents = ''.join(file.readlines())
encrypted_contents = cipher.encrypt(contents)

","I think you may be misunderstanding the algorithm you're using here. CAST is a symmetric-key algorithm, but whilst this implementation has an ""OpenPGP mode"", that doesn't mean that you simply pass your public key to it.
You should be generating a unique 16 byte key and passing that to CAST.new(). You would then generally encrypt that randomly-generated key using the public-key, and store/transmit the cipher text, and encrypted random-key together. The decryption process would decrypt the random-key using the private-key, then use the decrypted random-key to decrypt the cipher text.

","Several questions based on what you've said above.
1) Why are you using an ancient version of Python?  Install Python 2.7 and be happier!
2) assuming you're unfortunately stuck with 2.4 for some unknown reason... it appears that Python is unable to find any of the binary extension module (.pyd) files that came with the hashlib package you installed.  Did you compile your own hashlib or install a binary version?
If so, make sure the _hashlib.pyd file is put somewhere in the PYTHONPATH or sys.path.
I haven't had a windows installer with precompiled binaries for hashlib up on http://code.krypto.org/python/hashlib in years as I lack the ability to build and test it... and Python 2.4 is so old that I assume anyone with the ability to install a binary on their system can just install a modern version of Python itself.

","This string ""xVF79DzOplxBTMCwAx+hoeDJhyhifPZEoACQJcFhrXA="" is a base64-encoded value.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64
Base64 encoding is widely used lots of applications, it's a good way to encode binary data into text.  If you're looking at a long encoded value, the ""="" at the end can be a good indicator of base64 encoding.  
In your python code you probably need to base64 decode the data before handing it to the decryption function.
I have two recommendations:

If crypto isn't a comfort zone for you, consult with someone who is good in this area for your project.
Be aware that embedding a symmetric encryption key in an Android app that you distribute is a bad idea.  Anyone that can get a copy of your app can extract that key and use it to decrypt or spoof your messages.

","Why are you not using ssl (aka https)? That should provide all the encryption needed to transport data securely and privately between the phone and App Engine.
The basics of it: Instead of sending data to http://yourapp.appspot.com/, send it to https://yourapp.appspot.com/.
For a complete secure and authenticated channel between App Engine and Android, you can use Google Cloud Endpoints. It will even generate the Android side code to call it.

"40615753","Need advice about AES CTR cipher python vs. Java","I'm working on project when some arbitrary data are encrypted using Python simple-crypt (source here) and same encrypted data are then used in java application.
I would like to understand conceptual difference between JSSE and Pycrypto.
This is python part doing encryption (source):
counter = Counter.new(HALF_BLOCK, prefix=salt[:HALF_BLOCK//8])
cipher = AES.new(cipher_key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=counter)

This is my attempt for java re-implementation of same operation:
SecretKeySpec key = new SecretKeySpec(cipher_key, ""AES"");
IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(salt, 0, HALF_BLOCK / 8);
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CTR/NoPadding"", ""BC"");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, ivSpec);

Problem here is that initialization of java Cipher throw exception:
java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: IV must be 16 bytes long.
    at org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JCEBlockCipher.engineInit(Unknown Source)
    at javax.crypto.Cipher.init(Cipher.java:1394)
    at javax.crypto.Cipher.init(Cipher.java:1327)

Value of HALF_BLOCK is 64.
So question is, how does python's AES implementation works with HALF_BLOCK/8 key size and java's not?
Thanks!
","The nonce (the ""left side"" of the IV; the ""right"" being the sequential counter) should be transported alongside the cipher text as the IV. There is no need to keep the nonce secret. It just must not be re-used for another message encrypted by the same key.  
It appears the Python code is generating a new Counter which is 64 bits long and sets the prefix (I'm assuming the nonce value) to be the first 8 bytes of the salt variable. It likely (huge assumption here because I don't have access to the Python code) starts the actual counter value at 0x00 * 8, so your initial IV would be:
salt = '#Eg����' # => UTF-8 encoding of 0x0123456789ABCDEF (not familiar enough with Python for the actual expression)
# Really may be misunderstanding, but as the AES IV must be 16 bytes, I imagine the terminology here is prefix = 8 bytes, sequence = 8 bytes
counter = Counter.new(HALF_BLOCK, prefix=salt[:HALF_BLOCK]) # => '0x01234567 89ABCDEF 00000000 00000000'
# Perform one encryption
counter # => '0x01234567 89ABCDEF 00000000 00000001'
# etc.

To perform the same operation in Java, it should be as simple as initializing your IvParameterSpec to the same as above (i.e. right-pad the first 8 bytes of the salt with 0 to 16 bytes).
// Intentionally verbose for demonstration; this can obviously be compacted
byte[] salt = org.bouncycastle.util.encoders.Hex.decode(""0123456789ABCDEF"");
byte[] nonceAndCounter = new byte[16];
System.arraycopy(salt, 0, nonceAndCounter, 0, ((int) (HALF_BLOCK / 8)));
IvParameterSpec iv = new IvParameterSpec(nonceAndCounter);

Here's a full test case which asserts that the encrypt and decrypt are internally compatible; you could also run this with data from the Python side to verify. 
    @Test
    public void testPythonCompatibility() {
        // Arrange

","The IV is a non-secret value and is commonly written in front of the ciphertext. Since, you've done that already, you don't need to write an additional IV file. RC2 has a block size of 64 bit, so the IV will always be 8 byte long.

Other problems:

Don't simply decode binary data such as ciphertexts, keys or IV, because those are most likely not printable.
Don't re-use the same cipher object if you're doing something different. The decryption needs a freshly initialized ARC2 object.

Using Arc4 encryption, I can successfully encrypt and decrypt on the iphone end but when I try decrypting on app engine, the result is garbled.  The ciphertext after encrypting on the client is the same as the text received on the server when I check logging, so if they are visually the same, why would decrypting fail? 
I thought maybe it has something to do with the encoding of the NSString, as I find I need to call encode() on the cipher on the server end before decrypting just to avoid decrypt() failing on it attempting to encode the cipher in ascii. I have a separate post that delves a bit into this. Can anyone offer some advice?
crypto++ / pycrypto with google app engine
Update:
I have discovered that the ciphertext resulting from encrypting in C with Crypto++ is not the same as the ciphertext from encrypting in python with PyCrypto.  Could there be something I'm doing wrong with initializing the keys?  I do something like:
    ARC4::Encryption enc(""a"");

in C. And in python I do:
testobj=ARC4.new('a')

The %-encoded resulting cipher is different in C than in python.  I noticed that in C, I can pass a 2nd parameter for keylength, which I guessed should be 1 for ""a"", resulting in a different cipher than when putting no parameter.  The %-encoded result was still different from the python encoding, though.
Does anything look particularly amiss with my init perhaps?
","I've discovered that the problem was not with the init of either crypto impl but rather mistakenly trying to stuff the encrypted cipher text into an NSString which cant simply take raw binary data with no particular encoding. The trick was to encode the data in base64 or base16 so that it is is readable, then use unhexlify on the server end before decrypting.

"24638786","Python AES Decryption Routine (Code Help)","I developed a code based on information available online regarding an AES Encryption and Decryption routine.
Language: Python 2.7.x
Complete Code - 
#!/usr/bin/python

import sys, os
import hashlib
import base64
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

## Variables in computation.
IV = u'1234567890123456'
BLOCK_SIZE = 32
INTERRUPT = u'\u0001'
PAD = u'\u0000'
SECRET = os.urandom(32)
filename=sys.argv[1]

def AddPadding(data, interrupt, pad, block_size):
   new_data = ''.join([data, interrupt])
   new_data_len = len(new_data)
   remaining_len = block_size - new_data_len
   to_pad_len = remaining_len % block_size
   pad_string = pad * to_pad_len
   return ''.join([new_data, pad_string])

def StripPadding(data, interrupt, pad):
   return data.rstrip(pad).rstrip(interrupt)

def encAES(cipher_code, file_data):
   data_padded = AddPadding(file_data, INTERRUPT, PAD, BLOCK_SIZE)
   encrypted = cipher_code.encrypt(data_padded)
   return encrypted

def decAES(cipher_code, file_data):
   decrypted  = cipher_code.decrypt(file_data)
   return StripPadding(decrypted, INTERRUPT, PAD)

def FileSave(fwname, fwdata):
   f = open(fwname, 'w')
   f.write(fwdata)
   f.close

def FileRead(frname):
   f = open(frname, 'rb')
   frdata = f.read()
   return frdata

cipher = AES.new(SECRET, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)

## Encryption
data2encrypt = base64.b64encode(FileRead(filename))
encrypted_data = encAES(cipher, data2encrypt)
encrypted_content = base64.b64encode(encrypted_data)

encrypted_filename = ""enc_""+filename
FileSave(encrypted_filename, encrypted_content)
print ""Encryption complete. File saved as: ""+ encrypted_filename

## Decryption
data2decrypt = base64.b64decode(FileRead(encrypted_filename))
decrypted_data = decAES(cipher, data2decrypt)
decrypted_content = base64.b64decode(decrypted_data)

decrypted_filename = ""dec_""+filename
FileSave(decrypted_filename, decrypted_content)
print ""Decryption complete. File saved as: ""+ decrypted_filename

Now, the encryption routine is working fine but Decryption Routine is giving an error -
Commandline - python test.py sample.txt 
ERROR:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""test.py"", line 65, in <module>
    decrypted_data = decAES(cipher, data2decrypt)
  File ""test.py"", line 38, in decAES
    return StripPadding(decrypted, INTERRUPT, PAD)
  File ""test.py"", line 29, in StripPadding
    return data.rstrip(pad).rstrip(interrupt)
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe6 in position 3: ordinal not in range(128)

What can be the possible workaround?
","You are concatenating a byte string with a Unicode value, triggering an automatic decode of the bytestring. This fails, as your decrypted text is not decodable as ASCII.
Don't use Unicode INTERRUPT and PAD values here; you are not reading Unicode data from the file here anyway:
INTERRUPT = '\1'
PAD = '\0'

You'll have to create a new instance of the AES object to decrypt; you cannot reuse the object you used for encrypting as it's IV state has been altered by the encryption:
decrypt_cipher = AES.new(SECRET, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)
decrypted_data = decAES(decrypt_cipher, data2decrypt)

With those changes your code works and can encrypt and again decrypt the data.

"8719893","Django not loading Module Pycrypto into model, will load into shell","I am using a Virtualenv on my Django install and have loaded in Pycrypto using    
pip install pycrypto

after sourcing my environment.
When I try to import Crypto into my model, I get an import error, however if load the shell using
manage.py shell

it does load in, with out an issue.
I am pretty sure that django is running from the virtualenv as is it running 1.3.1 which more current than what is installed on the path and I have installed South via pip which is working.
I have also tried to install Pycrypto using 
setup.py install

Any thoughts on how I fix/debug this?
Thanks
Edit:
I am relatively new to Django and Python so it could be something simple
Edit 2:
Hey Issac,
Is there any way that you can find all the modules getting loaded in?
I don't understand why it wouldn't work in browser but would work in the interactive shell? I am not saying that it can't, i just don't know if/how that could happen.

","Just before the line which causes the import error insert this code:
import sys
assert False, sys.path

Compare both results.
In the shell (where you can import the module). You can do this:

assert False, Crypto.__file__

Is the directory of this result in sys.path of your webserver?

I should also note that I have VS 2013 installed, as I'm reading that I may need to compile the whole thing or something.
Anyway, as an option I have a Fedora installed on a Virtual Box, not sure how use it though but if it is ""easier"" on Fedora I can try to install it there.
I'm actively searching for a solution but am short on time and would like some help. Thanks.
","You probably installed 32bit version of Python - install 64bit version.
pycrypto-2.6.win-amd64-py3.3.exe is binary package which means it's already compiled so you don't need compiler to install it. If compilation were needed you would have to have the same version of Visual C++ which was used to build Python itself; in case of the official Python 3.3 that's Visual C++ 2010 not 2013. See What version of Visual Studio and/or MinGW do I need to build extension modules for a given version of Python? question for more details.

message = 'To be encrypted'
key = RSA.generate(2048)
cipher = PKCS1_v1_5.new(key)
ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(message)

That code runs fine, and I'm able to decrypt the ciphertext. However, I need to be able to serialize these ciphers. I haven't had any problem pickle-ing other pyCrypto ciphers, like AES, but when I try to pickle an RSA cipher I run into the following error:

Is there anything I can do to get around this -- another serialization framework, a different construction method for the RSA object, etc., or is this just an un-pickle-able object?
","Pickling works fine for the public key component, but when it comes to the whole key, the _randfunc doesn't survive pickling. I had come across the same error when working on a project.

","It seems like PyCrypto does not provide PKCS#7 padding / unpadding (as it should). So you should implement this using data = data[:-data[-1]]. So you should perform this on variable c directly after the call to decrypt.
You could check all the (in this case 7) padding bytes, but if you want to protect against invalid ciphertext, you should really add a MAC (HMAC) instead.

I realize there are much better ways of doing this and while I'm more than interested in learning about them my priority is simply learning pycryptos libraries which is why I decided to use an example I found here as a simple test. See below for a small example

tempTest = ""This is just a quick dirty example\nshowing that the encryption does work""
random = e.Encrypt(tempTest)
print(random)

decrypted = e.Decrypt(random)
print(""\n\n\n\n"" + decrypted)

Produces the following output

    }

    if(hProvParty1)

I believe that I can complete the Diffie-Hellman key exchange in Python, as I can generate the same public and private keys without error. I've based my Diffie-Hellman key exchange on this repository.
I haven't been able to test this, however as I can't seem to get the shared secret exported from the C++ code (similar to this thread, that was never satisfactorily answered). I can however get the RC4 session key with the following code:
// Get the key length
DWORD keylen;
CryptExportKey(   
    hSessionKey1,
    NULL,    
    PLAINTEXTKEYBLOB,
    0,
    NULL,
    &keylen);

// Get the session key
CryptExportKey(   
    hSessionKey1,
    NULL,     
    PLAINTEXTKEYBLOB,   
    0,  
    encKey,    
    &keylen);

The output from this function gets me:
08 02 00 00 01 68 00 00 10 00 00 00 75 2c 59 8c 6e e0 8c 9f ed 30 17 7e 9d a5 85 2b

I know there is a 12 byte header+length on this, so that leaves me with the following 16 byte RC4 session key:
75 2c 59 8c 6e e0 8c 9f ed 30 17 7e 9d a5 85 2b

So I am currently trying to validate that I can encrypt the same plaintext using the RC4 that I have acquired from the CryptExportKey. I am currently trying to encrypt g_rgbData from the C++ code above, which is set to:
BYTE g_rgbData[] = {0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08};

With the C++ code I get the following encrypted output:
cc 94 aa ec 86 6e a8 26

Using pycrypto I have the following code:
from Crypto.Cipher import ARC4
key = '75 2c 59 8c 6e e0 8c 9f ed 30 17 7e 9d a5 85 2b'
key = key.replace(' ', '').decode('hex')

plaintext = '0102030405060708'
plaintext = plaintext.replace(' ', '').decode('hex')

rc4 = ARC4.new(key)
encrypted = rc4.encrypt(plaintext)

print encrypted.encode('hex')

This results in the following output:
00 5b 64 25 4e a5 62 e3

Which doesn't match the C++ output. I've played around with endianess, but I suspect something else might be going on. 
Sorry if this is long winded, but it brings me to my two questions:

Whenever you transition from the shared key to RC4 (using CryptSetKeyParam with CALG_RC4), what is actually going on under the hood here? I can't seem to find any information about this process anywhere so that I can implement it in Python.
Any idea why my RC4 will not work with the same key and the same plaintext in Python?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
","According to the PyCrypto docs your key must be minimum 40 bytes:

key (byte string) - The secret key to use in the symmetric cipher. It can have any length, with a minimum of 40 bytes. Its cryptograpic strength is always capped to 2048 bits (256 bytes).

but then there is a contradiction just above:

key_size = xrange(1, 257)
Size of a key (in bytes)

allowing key-lengths to be from 1-256, so I'm not sure if this even helps.

I believe that I can complete the Diffie-Hellman key exchange in Python, as I can generate the same public and private keys without error. I've based my Diffie-Hellman key exchange on this repository.
I haven't been able to test this, however as I can't seem to get the shared secret exported from the C++ code (similar to this thread, that was never satisfactorily answered). I can however get the RC4 session key with the following code:
// Get the key length
DWORD keylen;
CryptExportKey(   
    hSessionKey1,
    NULL,    
    PLAINTEXTKEYBLOB,
    0,
    NULL,
    &keylen);

// Get the session key
CryptExportKey(   
    hSessionKey1,
    NULL,     
    PLAINTEXTKEYBLOB,   
    0,  
    encKey,    
    &keylen);

The output from this function gets me:
08 02 00 00 01 68 00 00 10 00 00 00 75 2c 59 8c 6e e0 8c 9f ed 30 17 7e 9d a5 85 2b

I know there is a 12 byte header+length on this, so that leaves me with the following 16 byte RC4 session key:
75 2c 59 8c 6e e0 8c 9f ed 30 17 7e 9d a5 85 2b

So I am currently trying to validate that I can encrypt the same plaintext using the RC4 that I have acquired from the CryptExportKey. I am currently trying to encrypt g_rgbData from the C++ code above, which is set to:
BYTE g_rgbData[] = {0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08};

With the C++ code I get the following encrypted output:
cc 94 aa ec 86 6e a8 26

Using pycrypto I have the following code:
from Crypto.Cipher import ARC4
key = '75 2c 59 8c 6e e0 8c 9f ed 30 17 7e 9d a5 85 2b'
key = key.replace(' ', '').decode('hex')

plaintext = '0102030405060708'
plaintext = plaintext.replace(' ', '').decode('hex')

rc4 = ARC4.new(key)
encrypted = rc4.encrypt(plaintext)

print encrypted.encode('hex')

This results in the following output:
00 5b 64 25 4e a5 62 e3

Which doesn't match the C++ output. I've played around with endianess, but I suspect something else might be going on. 
Sorry if this is long winded, but it brings me to my two questions:

","Finally had some time to look over your code. When I run your code locally, I am able to export the session key and can use it successfully in pycrypto. My guess is that you are either not exporting the session key correctly (e.g. is what you posted what you are running?) or the data you are encrypting in C++ is not the same data that you are encrypting in Python - double check that the data you are encrypting is also correct. I suspect that it's probably the latter, as there isn't really much you can screw up with the CryptExportKey you've posted.

Then, I tried the pip and easy_install way. It still failed by telling No matching distribution found for pycrypto while I successfully installed on x86 platform (my Ubuntu) using the same pip command.

"20390762","Python Crypto RSA textbook encryption versus openssl - what is it doing?","I have an existing set of Python code that uses the primitive (textbook) RSA encryption mechanism to encrypt small pieces of data. Specifically, the python code loads a public key into variable publickey and then encrypts this data using the following code:
ciphertext = publickey.encrypt(plaintext,None)

Yes I have read the disclaimer that ""this function performs the plain, primitive RSA encryption (textbook). In real applications, you always need to use proper cryptographic padding,..."" Unfortunately, I cannot change this code at the present time, so I am stuck with using this ""textbook"" encrypt command.
Note that even though this command does not use any padding scheme, it still seems to be able to encrypt any (appropriately small) amount of plaintext. In other words, the plaintext can be any length up to whatever limit is imposed by RSA.
Now however, I want to use the OPENSSL C library in an IOS app to do an identical RSA encryption. I cannot figure out how to do the exact same thing that the python function is doing. OPENSSL has a method RSA_public_encrypt where you pass in the size of the plaintext, the plaintext itself, an RSA object pointer which contains public key information, and the RSA padding mechanism. To replicate what python is doing in the crypto library, I thought I could use RSA_NO_PADDING as the padding mechanism. The problem is that OPENSSL states in their documentation that if you use RSA_NO_PADDING, then the length of the plaintext to encrypt must be EXACTLY equal to a certain value: RSA_Size(rsa) where rsa is a pointer to the RSA object passed in (the object that contains the public key).
In other words, the python crypto library seems to be able to encrypt variable length plaintext with no padding, but OPENSSL requires plaintext to be fixed length. So what exactly is the python crypto library doing to handle the variable size of the plaintext, and is there any way I can replicate this in OPENSSL?
","If you look at the documentation for RSA_NO_PADDING, they explain:

This mode should only be used to implement cryptographically sound
  padding modes in the application code. Encrypting user data directly
  with RSA is insecure.

In other words, RSA_NO_PADDING is for cases where you're going to handle padding on your own, so OpenSSL expects an input of the proper size. It doesn't mean ""textbook RSA"". 
Is there a compelling reason you can't change the python code? Textbook RSA is insecure and you're taking a great risk by using it.

","The error message provides vital clues as to what is going on. As you can see, the first 16 bytes of the decrypted message are different, but the next 16 bytes are the same. This happens when the key is correct, but the IV isn't.
The problem seems to be that pyCrypto doesn't reset the state of the cipher after the encryption/decryption and the IV is some other value.
Either way, you shouldn't be setting the IV once and reusing it multiple times. The IV is there to provide randomization of the ciphertexts so that attackers who observe the ciphertexts cannot determine whether the plaintext that is encrypted has repeated.
Moving AES object creation into the function, solves this issue:
key = r'Sixteen byte key'  # Keep this real secret

def encode(role, plaintext):
    '''Encode the message, prefix with the role specifier'''
    iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)

    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
    plaintext = cipher.decrypt(msg[AES.block_size:])
    return role, plaintext

You should check out the 2.7-alpha release of pyCrypto which includes authenticated modes such as GCM, EAX, SIV. Ciphertext authentication is important, because it might be possible to use a padding oracle attack in your system to decrypt any ciphertext.

the code is part of an attempt to encrypt whole folders but I am currently testing the encryption and the decryption of a single file. I left the IV simple and have not salted the hash for comfort reasons. 
for some reason this code does not digest and decrypt the encrypted file correctly. 
Also, as I am pretty new in this field I have a pretty basic question, why is IV so important?
EDIT:
I mistakenly wrote decrypt instead of encrypt, now I fixed this it seems to manage to decrypt the file other than the first 16 bytes, does this have something to do with the IV(my guess due tot the fact the IV is 16 bytes long)?
EDIT 2:
Solved it by making the IV the first 16 bytes of the file instead of the same IV used for encoding, sorry for the hassle. Would love to get an answer on the reason and importance of the IV, if possible. thank you.

When using the original python scripts, the decrypted output is 127 bytes long, while the C# code I have is 16 bytes long.

C# Script Output
11-5C-31-5E-EE-76-FE-F5-4A-9E-04-51-8A-3D-93-EC

As you can see the output of the C# code is only 16 bytes long, however it directly matches the last 16 bytes of the python script. I'm not sure exactly what is going on, and my (basic) understanding of RSA tells me it should be an all or nothing function--the whole text gets decrypted, or I get gibberish.
","The issue here is padding. RSA operations require that the message be padded with a secure padding scheme before encryption. Otherwise, certain attacks exist that could recover the private key. Here's a good article explaining why.
For some reason, the Python crypto library is not removing the padding for you, but the C# library is. So you'll have to remove the padding manually in the Python code.
Lucky for you, from the data you give, it looks like the padding scheme being used here is PKCS#1.5. That's a relatively simple padding scheme that will be easy to handle. The full specs are in RFC 3447, but it boils down to this:
EM = 0x00 || 0x02 || PS || 0x00 || M.

where EM is the padded message before encryption, PS is the padding, and M is the original, unpadded message.
Here's a Python function that should do the job for you:
def RemovePKCS15Padding( padded_msg ):
    if len(padded_msg) < 2 or padded_msg[0]!='\x02':
        raise PaddingError # or whatever
    p = padded_msg.find('\x00')
    if p < 0:
        raise PaddingError # or whatever
    return padded_msg[p+1:]

Conceptually, the user logs in via firebase google signin, the angular web client gets the id token using the firebase client libraries and sends it to the google endpoint. The google endpoint verifies the id token to grant access.
After reading and working through various articles I have finally got something working, however I have very little experience in this area of authorization and was wondering if there was a better way to do this.
Code to get the id token on the client side is 
firebase.auth().currentUser.getToken(true).then(function(idToken) {
   // Send token to your backend via HTTPS
}

This code works and I get the correct id token.
For now I am using postman to send this id token to the app engine endpoint in the authorization header.

","Apparently, you have 2 Python3 instances installed:

Python3.6:


Which is the one you want to use
Where pycrypto is installed (by pip3)

Python3.5.2:


Which is launched by python3 command


So, you are launching the wrong Python interpreter, most likely because python3 points to /usr/bin/python3 (you can check that by typing which python3 in your shell), which is Python3.5.2, and whose path is in the ${PATH} env var.
From your pip paths, it seems like Python3.6 is installed under /usr/local (and the executable would be /usr/local/bin/python3), so you can either:

Launch the Python3 executable by its full path (/usr/local/bin/python3, as stated above)
Add /usr/local/bin to ${PATH} before /usr/bin, and then simply launch Python3.6 by typing python3 in your shell - but I'd advise against that
There are other methods (e.g. creating an alias), but I guess you got the idea

@EDIT0:
Some more info as requested in comments. This has nothing to do with Python, it' all just Ubtu stuff:

To list packages: use apt or dpkg
To check Python2.7 (or any other version): use which (as above)
You don't need to uninstall Python3.5. Multiple version can coexist safely
If you want to make one as default, make an alias (like I did at the end of the example below) and if you want it to be persistent, place it in your profile file (e.g. .profile, .bashrc, .bash_profile)

openssl rsautl -inkey private_key.pem -raw -sign

(Also, the result of encrypting with the private key)
Unfortunately, in Pycrypto the corresponding .verify() method only takes an argument to verify the data against to return true or false.
In openssl, this could be achieved with one of the following:
# Private key based
openssl rsautl -inkey private_key.pem -raw -verify
# Public key based
openssl rsautl -inkey public_key.pem -pubin -raw -verify

How can I achieve the same functionality in Pycrypto?
(I understand the risks of raw RSA. A custom padding mechanism has been implemented to mitigate some of those risks. Unfortunately, it's not possible to change the current implementation)
","Delving into the .verify() method, one can find how Pycrypto builds the verification signature before comparing it to the given required signature.
It essentially uses Python's pow() method with the key's public (e) and the key's modulus (n). You will first need to pack the secret message into a (long) integer and then convert the result back to bytes. Fortunately, Pycrypto provides everything you need.
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Util import number

key = RSA.importKey(private_key_str, key_password_str)

# The message must be packed as a long first.
secret_message_long = number.bytes_to_long(secret_message_bytes)
# The magic!        
verify_long = pow(encrypted_session_key_long, key.e, key.n)
# and back to bytes
verify_bytes = number.long_to_bytes(result_long)

# Convert message back to a str (Unicode str in Py2).

I am trying to import Crypto when I get this error. Why does this happen and how can I fix it?
","According to the pyinstaller manual:

You can verify that hidden import is the problem by using Python's verbose imports flag. If the import messages say ""module not found"", but the warnproject.txt file has no ""no module named..."" message for the same module, then the problem is a hidden import.
Hidden imports are handled by hooking the module (the one doing the hidden imports) at Analysis time. Do this as follows:

Create a file named hook-module.py (where module is the fully-qualified Python name, eg, hook-xml.dom.py) and place it somewhere. Remember the place as your private hooks directory.
In the .spec file, pass your private hooks directory as hookspath argument to Analysis so will be searched. Example:
a = Analysis(['myscript.py'], hookspath='/my/priv/hooks') 
  In most cases the hook module will have only one line:
hiddenimports = ['module1', 'module2']
  When the Analysis finds this file, it will proceed exactly as though the module explicitly imported module1 and module2.


This question seems related, the answers might also be useful for you.
Finally, this report seems to contain a similar problem. The user seemingly was able to fix it by updating to pyinstaller 2.1, so you might want to give that a try if you haven't already.

Can anyone help me with this problem? I have used a Python 2 to 3 tool, but it still didn't work.
Also, could you please fix the directory problem? It isn't necessary, but I would like it.

EDIT: I have replaced str with bytes and bytearray but it returns the same error.
","Your 'password' variable is a string, but SHA256.new expects bytes (to allow for unicode, for example). That you need bytes is listed in the Crypto.Hash.SHA256 documentation.
The solution is to encode the password to bytes before hashing. This is almost literally what the error message says (if you know that all strings in python 3 are unicode objects):
TypeError: Unicode-objects must be encoded before hashing

The solution is for example to encode with utf8 :
SHA256.new(password.encode('utf8')).digest()

"12468835","Errors when including DES.pyd in python 2.6 solution","I have installed Python 2.7 on my windows 7 x64 system with PyCrypto 2.5 compiled and built in. In my install path of D:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\Crypto\Cipher I see DES.pyd. I have opened it with dependency walker and ensured it had initDES as its only export.
What I wanted to do was copy/paste DES.pyd out now that it's built and use it in my code. So now I have my project folder D:\project containing test.py and DES.pyd.
test.py contains the code:
import sys
sys.path.append(""D:\\project\\"")
import DES
print 'hi'

when running test.py, i receive the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""test.py"", line 3, in <module>
    import DES
SystemError: dynamic module not initialized properly</code></pre>

The purpose of this exercise is to be able to send DES.pyd and test.py to my friend without having them require to build and install pycrypto (a PITA). I fully understand my code above does absolutely nothing involving DES, the fact that it cannot import it is my main curiosity. Real code using DES will follow. 
Also, if I import DES.pyd directly from the python path like from Crypto.Cipher import DES works just fine.
Thanks!
","Take a look at the source code at https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/blob/master/src/block_template.c#L801. The module name is hard coded to Crypto.Cipher._DES. Initialization will fail if _DES.pyd is not in the Crypto.Cipher package directory.

"47290667","Simple Python AES decryption for longer ciphertexts","I am not an expert in AES and moreover I have to deliver the deciphering function to a very limited Python 2 environment.
I have a 32-byte key and a 16-byte initialisation vector along with a 64-byte test cipher message - all of type str. AES operates in a cipher-block chaining mode.
With pycrypto it all works and I get a 64-symbol decrypted message of type unicode.
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, vector)
decryption = cipher.decrypt(message).decode()
print(decryption)

Unfortunately the pycrypto itself is not supported in the final environment as I believe it has some fancy compiled dependencies for AES.
There is a purely Python alternative called pyaes:
import pyaes

cipher = pyaes.AESModeOfOperationCBC(key, vector)
decryption = cipher.decrypt(message[0:16]).decode()
print(decryption)

Notice that I sliced the first 16 bytes and got the first 16 symbols of the decrypted message (of type unicode) correctly.
However, once I try the full message I get
ValueError: ciphertext block must be 16 bytes.
Even if I slice message[16:32], I get 
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xb8 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128).
So how to use the pyaes and decrypt longer ciphertexts in my case?

The secret plaintext looks like this
{""valueInt"":123, ""valueFloat"":1.23, ""valueString"":""123""}

with trailing (padded) spaces.
","Possibility 1. The case of the message[16:32] is that the first part of your unencrypted text could have multibyte characters, so after taking 16 bytes, 1+ byte is leaking to the second part of your original/unencrypted string. Though this is only if you are using multibyte characters.
If you are also encrypting them, you could try converting the text to binary first if your encoding is utf8: 
cipher.encrypt(mystring.encode('utf8'))

and in reverse
cipher.decrypt(mystring.decode('utf8'))

Possiblity 2. If you are decrypting with the same AESModeOfOperationCFB you should try with a new instance for decryption. The following code fails to decrypt the correct text which contains non valid ascii bytes.
cipher = pyaes.AESModeOfOperationCBC(key, vector)
encrypted = cipher.decrypt('Hello world')
print(encrypted)
# ?Eg?m??K?(|
decrypted = cipher.decrypt(encrypted)
print(decrypted)
# ?XL=?-QE??Y?=k

But if you do this way:
encrypter = pyaes.AESModeOfOperationCBC(key, vector)
encrypted = cipher.encrypt('Hello world !!!!')
print(encrypted)
# ?Eg?m??K?(|
decrypter = pyaes.AESModeOfOperationCBC(key, vector)
decrypted = decrypter.decrypt(encrypted)
# Hello world !!!!

If you are encrypting 2 blocks with same instance and then concatenate them, you need a new instance which decrypt 2 new blocks. Or encrypt/decrypt each block with a new instance each.

","It looks like you can achieve this with pyca/cryptography if you do not mind doing some lower-level OpenSSL programming. You can give this a try:

from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization
from cryptography.hazmat.bindings.openssl.binding import Binding

_lib = Binding.lib
_ffi = Binding.ffi

with open('key.pem', 'rb') as key_file:
    private_key = serialization.load_pem_private_key(
        key_file.read(), None, default_backend())

with open('cert.pem', 'rb') as cert_file:
    cert = x509.load_pem_x509_certificate(
        cert_file.read(), default_backend())

bio_in = _lib.BIO_new_mem_buf(msg.encode('utf-8'), len(msg))
pkcs7 = _lib.PKCS7_sign(cert._x509, private_key._evp_pkey, _ffi.NULL, bio_in, 0)

bio_out=_lib.BIO_new(_lib.BIO_s_mem())
_lib.PEM_write_bio_PKCS7(bio_out, pkcs7)

result_buffer = _ffi.new('char**')
buffer_length = _lib.BIO_get_mem_data(bio_out, result_buffer)
sout = _ffi.buffer(result_buffer[0], buffer_length)[:]

print(sout.decode('utf-8'))

This script is for illustration purposes only and there might be better ways to do it. This approach basically mimics your openssl smime command.
If you do want to go down this path, you will have to look closer at memory management and free up things when you are done. There is a reason why this stuff is called hazmat...

","I suspect you have not correctly transferred your encrypted token. But there isn't a lot to go on.

Our application uses Python 2.7
EDIT: we have some database fields that we want protected, that need to be accessed in the code but there is no reason to leave them in the database in plain text. Obviously I'd like to make it as hard as possible to retrieve the key (understanding that it is never impossible). 
","There is no way to absolutely protect a key if you don't trust the environment that the code is running in. You could store (part of) the key in a trusted location and only accept queries for the key from the domain/IP of your app. But then it would still be in that appengine instance's memory.
The best solution for outgoing messages is to use public-key crypto. Let your code use the public key of the remote party, since those don't have to be kept secret. It can then only be decrypted with the remote's private key.
If you can't trust the appengine's environment, you can't decrypt incoming public-key messages because that would require your secret key to be available to the application.
Edit: Since you've added that you want to protect some database fields, have you thought about hashing them?

Unlike CBC where decrypting with the IV recovers at least a part of the plaintext, OFB is a streaming mode. If the alignment between actual ciphertext and generated stream (based in IV and key) is not perfect, the original plaintext cannot be recovered.

"16081930","How to get jCryption work with django and python-rsa (or another python library)","I want to send some secret data to the client, so I want to encrypt it.
I'm using jCryption in client side. It uses handshaking in the beginning of the connection, the procedures happen as follows:

client generate random AES password.
client request RSA publicKey form server
server send it
Client use RSA public key to encrypt the password and send it to server.
Now, both use that password to encrypt data they send to each other.

My problem is in the step of sending the password encrypted with RSA (step 4), since jCryption sends it in hex format, but python-rsa expect binary integer ,,
How to convert the jCryption output to a format python-rsa can deal with, or is there are another library that can do it ?
the RSA ciphertext is look like this:

TO\xa75[\x9a\x07s4\x86\xbc\xae\xe3\xd5s)1\x0cd5\xdfY\xf7\xeds9\xf3~\n\x9fA$\xa9\xfb;\x04\x1e\x18\xf4\xea\x7f\x91\xd9\xb7[\xd3\x138\xb6b\x9c\xb6\x1b\xe7\x11\x9aB\x1d@`y\x9c0\xe8\xb6!\x8b~lg\xabO\xbeny\xf7Xu\x89YW\xb0\xda@\x10\x0c\xe7\x85\x9bX\x8f\x02e\xdalf|\xa6\x0e\x8e\x8e\x9d\xd8=\x9bQLO7\x0fd\x19/]t?\xf1\x96\x1b\xb9\x8bv\xb4\xb4rS\x1c\xb9

","Ok I've done this quest but first I want to say that it's much easier to obtain LetsEncrypt free cert for https what i did later.
For this solution you need openssl to be installed.
Lets write views for our ajaxes
Getting public key. If we don't have one in project directory then generate the pair.
    def public_key(req):
        if not os.path.isfile(os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR, 'form_key.pem')) or not os.path.isfile(os.path.join( settings.BASE_DIR,'form_key_pub.pem')):
            check_call(['openssl', 'genrsa', '-out', os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR,'form_key.pem'), '4096'])
            check_call(['openssl', 'rsa', '-pubout', '-in', os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR,'form_key.pem'), '-out', os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR,'form_key_pub.pem')])
        f = open(os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR,'form_key_pub.pem'))
        key = f.read()
        f.close()
        return JsonResponse({""publickey"": key})

Ok, and the handshake. To CSRF protect this view we need to patch the jCryption javascript library what i didn't.
I save AES key in session storage here.
    @csrf_exempt
    def handshake(req):
        if req.method == 'POST':
            encb64key = req.POST['key']
            encb64key = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9/=+]', '', encb64key)
            enckey = b64decode(encb64key)
            openssl = Popen(['openssl', 'rsautl', '-decrypt', '-inkey', os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR,'form_key.pem')], stdin = PIPE, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
            key, stderr = openssl.communicate(enckey)
            print stderr
            key = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', key)
            req.session['form_key'] = key 
            openssl = Popen(['openssl', 'enc', '-aes-256-cbc', '-pass', 'pass:'+key, '-a', '-e'], stdin = PIPE, stdout = PIPE, stderr = PIPE)

            return JsonResponse({'challenge': enckey})
        raise Http404() 

Lets choose urls for the views in urls.py
    url('^pubkey', public_key, name = 'publickey'),
    url('^handshake', handshake, name = 'handshake'),

And the most tricky part. Our own middleware. You need to add it to MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES in settings.py . Something like 'myapp.views.JCryptionMiddleware' if you place it in your myapp's views.py file.
The trick is that we send the wrong POST data with only 'jCryption' attr. The middleware decrypts apropriate data in this attr and rewrites the POST data in the request object with it.
Read about middlewares in Django documentation.
    class JCryptionMiddleware(object):
        def process_view(self, request, callback, callback_args, callback_kwargs):
            jcryptedb64 = request.POST.get('jCryption', '')
            if jcryptedb64:
                try:
                    jcrypted = b64decode(jcryptedb64)
                    p = Popen(['openssl', 'enc', '-aes-256-cbc', '-pass', 'pass:'+request.session['form_key'], '-d'], stdin = PIPE, stdout = PIPE, stderr = PIPE)
                    qstr, stderr = p.communicate(jcrypted)
                    print stderr
                    wasmutable = request.POST._mutable
                    request.POST._mutable = True
                    request.POST.__init__(qstr)
                    request.POST._mutable = wasmutable
                except Exception as e:
                    print e
            return None

And the client code in the page with the form template.
    <script src=""{{ STATIC_URL }}js/jquery.min.js""></script>
    <script src=""{{ STATIC_URL }}js/jcryption.js""></script>
    <script>
    $(function() {
        $('form').jCryption({""getKeysURL"": ""/pubkey"", ""handshakeURL"": ""/handshake""});
    });
    </script>

See the urls from our urls.py .
For example you can encrypt your admin login form. Copy login.html from django contrib admin to templates/admin/login.html and add this javascript code to the template.

"45228282","Encryption (aes-128-cbc) not matching between python(pycrypto) and nodejs(crypto)","I have got this piece of python code which I need to translate into nodejs. The python code uses pycrypto from encryption. On the nodejs side, I am using the native crypto module. There seems to be a mismatch between the encrypted strings.   
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from binascii import b2a_hex, a2b_hex
import json

raw_key = [0x58, 0x86, 0x17, 0x6d, 0x88, 0x7c, 0x9a, 0xa0, 0x61, 0x1b, 0xbb, 0x3e, 0x20, 0x28, 0xa4, 0x5a]
key = str(bytearray(raw_key))

raw_iv =  [0x34, 0x2e, 0x17, 0x99, 0x6d, 0x19, 0x3d, 0x28, 0xdd, 0xb3, 0xa2, 0x69, 0x5a, 0x2e, 0x6f, 0x1b]
iv = str(bytearray(raw_iv))

text = json.dumps({ ""a"": 1, ""b"": 2 })

cryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
length = 16
count = len(text)
add = length - (count % length)
text = text + ('\0' * add)
encrypted = cryptor.encrypt(text);
print b2a_hex(encrypted)

The above python code outputs
5c72b1a394654b6dab9ea8fdd90fe56b92141d74cb32ac65ede4d3154801bb57

whereas the below nodejs code
const crypto = require('crypto');

const KEY = Buffer.from([0x58, 0x86, 0x17, 0x6d, 0x88, 0x7c, 0x9a, 0xa0, 0x61, 0x1b, 0xbb, 0x3e, 0x20, 0x28, 0xa4, 0x5a]);
const IV = Buffer.from([0x34, 0x2e, 0x17, 0x99, 0x6d, 0x19, 0x3d, 0x28, 0xdd, 0xb3, 0xa2, 0x69, 0x5a, 0x2e, 0x6f, 0x1b]);

const text = JSON.stringify({ a: 1, b: 2 });

const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-128-cbc', KEY, IV);
cipher.setAutoPadding(true);
const encrypted = Buffer.concat([cipher.update(text, 'utf-8'), cipher.final()]);
console.log(encrypted.toString('hex'));

outputs

Why don't they match? Am I doing something wrong?
","There are two issues here:

Node's automatic padding is PKCS padding. Your python code is using null bytes for padding instead, which is a different format. The node documentation even explicitly mentions disabling auto padding in order to use null byte padding.
The JSON is formatted slightly differently between node and python. Javascript's JSON.stringify() removes all unnecessary whitespace, whereas python leaves some whitespace (e.g. between elements in an array/object). The easiest solution to this will probably be to change the python code to specify an explicit separators option: json.dumps({ ""a"": 1, ""b"": 2 }, separators=(',', ':')), since the javascript's JSON.stringify() isn't as flexible when it comes to changing the formatting in this way.

The node code below shows that by matching the JSON output and using the proper padding, you will get the same hex output as python:
const crypto = require('crypto');

const KEY = Buffer.from([0x58, 0x86, 0x17, 0x6d, 0x88, 0x7c, 0x9a, 0xa0, 0x61, 0x1b, 0xbb, 0x3e, 0x20, 0x28, 0xa4, 0x5a]);
const IV = Buffer.from([0x34, 0x2e, 0x17, 0x99, 0x6d, 0x19, 0x3d, 0x28, 0xdd, 0xb3, 0xa2, 0x69, 0x5a, 0x2e, 0x6f, 0x1b]);

var text = '{""a"": 1, ""b"": 2}';

const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-128-cbc', KEY, IV);
cipher.setAutoPadding(false);

var length = 16;
var count = Buffer.byteLength(text);
var add = length - (count % length);
if (add > 0)
  text += '\0'.repeat(add);

const encrypted = Buffer.concat([cipher.update(text, 'utf-8'), cipher.final()]);
console.log(encrypted.toString('hex'));

","Why does the Python implementation not produce the same results as the C code?  Because you're using the PKCS #1.5 signature algorithm.
PKCS #1.5 calls for adding random padding to the message before signing it.  Because of this, signing the same message multiple times will give a different value each time -- which you'll see if you run the Python version repeatedly.  The OpenSSL documentation is an impenetrable morass, so I can't say exactly why you're getting the same signature every time with the C version, but I suspect you're failing to initialize a random-number generator or something.

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

","You are doing completely different operations with openssl and with Python. You are performing RSA signing with openssl, but RSA encryption with PyCrypto. With openssl, as the documentation makes clear:
#include <openssl/rsa.h>
int RSA_private_encrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from, unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa, int padding);


RSA_private_encrypt() signs the flen bytes at from (usually a
  message digest with an algorithm identifier) using the private key rsa
  and stores the signature in to. to must point to RSA_size(rsa) bytes
  of memory.

In other words it perform RSA PKCS #1 ver 1.5 block type 1 signing.
Whereas in PyCrypto, despite the fact that you are using a private key, the encrypt method treats it as a public key (a pycrypto RSA private key is a subclass of RSA public key) and performs RSA PKCS#1 version 1.5 block type 2 encryption.
Since you give no hint of what you are trying to accomplish I can't say which result is the correct one.
If you want PyCrypto RSA signing, the documentation has this example:
>>> from Crypto.Signature import pkcs1_15
>>> from Crypto.Hash import SHA256
>>> from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
>>>
>>> message = 'To be signed'
>>> key = RSA.import_key(open('private_key.der').read())
>>> h = SHA256.new(message)
>>> signature = pkcs1_15.new(key).sign(h)

","The CSP blob format is proprietary to Microsoft and poorly documented. Rather than use that format I would instead use the ExportParameters method to get an RSAParameters struct. From this struct I would directly access the Exponent and Modulus byte arrays and base64 encode them for transfer to the python program, as in the following snippet:
var rsa = RSA.Create ();
var RsaParms = rsa.ExportParameters (false);
Console.WriteLine (Convert.ToBase64String( RsaParms.Modulus));
Console.WriteLine (Convert.ToBase64String (RsaParms.Exponent));

In the python program, the documentation for PyCrypto's RSA importKey mentions a few options for acceptable formats. The simplest of these is the PKCS#1 RSAPublicKey structure. This is quite easy to construct from the asn1 module, as in the following snippet:
mod_raw = b64decode('qLhDLGNh7+9xRahkaWILm5HcG3T0Q4SUoDA3bpQtqLxU3AQ/fmYQWLXh0Se1mhQ3AIMduVgKaJhK1sH+G/toXuQ0n5ENw6PtGMODwsDXF072kaBKD3JBZSESC9a9a8QDoGtv7WwvH1UcIE9di60C7YdBMlqqBgkjMQ6c3CTh9KU=')

When I specify a single argument to RSA.generate – the number of bits, e.g. 4096 – such as the code below, everything works fine in version 2.6.1:
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
keys = RSA.generate(4096)

But when I run it with PyCrypto version 2.0.1, I get the following error:
TypeError: generate_c() takes at least 2 arguments (1 given)

I know that the new API has a randfunc=None and that is the reason why it works in 2.6.1.
My problem is that I do not know what is an acceptable randfunc in 2.0.1. What should I use?
","You should use os.urandom.
Quoting from the PyCrypto documentation:

randfunc (callable) - Random number generation function; it should accept a single integer N and return a string of random data N bytes long. If not specified, a new one will be instantiated from Crypto.Random.


and then there’s an “Attention” section:

You should always use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as the one defined in the Crypto.Random module; don't just use the current time and the random module.


The Crypto.Random module isn’t present in PyCrypto 2.0.1, so you can’t use this approach here. Instead, you should use os.urandom(). Quoting from the docs (emphasis mine):

Return a string of n random bytes suitable for cryptographic use.
This function returns random bytes from an OS-specific randomness source. The returned data should be unpredictable enough for cryptographic applications, though its exact quality depends on the OS implementation. On a UNIX-like system this will query /dev/urandom, and on Windows it will use CryptGenRandom(). If a randomness source is not found, NotImplementedError will be raised.


That sounds like an appropriate choice of randfunc to me.

Below is my python code than that decrypts successfully, but encrypts unsuccessfully.
The successfull decryption of the perl passphrase was mostly for verify input params. (Taking IV straight from perl and removing Crypt::CBC's added 16 char of salt before decrypting made it work, various posts on SO helped me..).
Then is the unsuccessful attempt to encryption passhphrase and generate the same output as perl.
I think i just need to use the right combination of the verified input params to get it working...maybe the salt should be padded? Or padding in general is wrong? Or iv input should not be hexlified? (it need to be 8 chars..)
Any input is appreciated!

","I know the thread is old but maybe it will help someone in the future. The hints below refer to Android Keystore v3 and v4 (Oreo and Pie respectively).
Basically the HAL keystore (as described here) is wrapped in the keystore service.
The service API mimics the interface described in IKeymasterDevice.hal. Instead of blob you can use a string alias for the key (e.g. ""mySecretKey"").
The service stores the keyblobs (raw key material + key parameters) to the file system. Default location is /data/misc/keystore/user_0/<uid>_<key_alias>.
Keystore service is also the layer which checks whether requesting process is allowed to use the key (based on process uid).
The communication with keystore service is done via binder interface (IPC). You may want to read more about it here.
AOSP contains reference client implementation here.
Example usage can be found in the stock CLI here
The AOSP comes with SW based keystore implementation which can be found here. By default the keyblob on AOSP builds are not encrypted.
Note that the stock keystore_cli_v2 does NOT provide support for key import. If you plan to encrypt the data offline (e.g. pycrypto) you must extend it. If you plan to do so remember that the keystore_client_impl.cpp is linked to libkeystore_binder.so and not the keystore_cli_v2.
For the asymmetric key ciphers you may export the public key component using the API.

I need it for keys  analysis in DES and 8 byte key requirement for associated library is creating problem in getting actual keys analysis.
","As explained in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard, the 8-byte key for DES is just a 56-bit key in 8 bytes with odd parity check added:
The key is nominally stored or transmitted as 8 bytes, each with odd parity. According to ANSI X3.92-1981, section 3.5:
One bit in each 8-bit byte of the KEY may be utilized for error detection in key generation, distribution, and storage. Bits 8, 16,..., 64 are for use in ensuring that each byte is of odd parity.

(end quote)
So given an 8-byte key I can generate a 7-byte key by dropping the parity check bits and reformatting, and given a 7-byte key I can generate an 8-byte key by reformatting and adding parity check bits. It should therefore be easy to produce wrappers to make a library for one key format look like a library for another - or are you having some other problem I haven't noticed?

I need it for keys  analysis in DES and 8 byte key requirement for associated library is creating problem in getting actual keys analysis.
","In DES a key is comprised of 8 bytes with the LSB a parity bit, a nice and regular structure.  There's an implication there for the relationship between input bytes and Permuted Choice 1, which loads the two 28 bit C and D Registers. 
In parlance of the NBS standard a Permuted Choice is a selection permutation not using all the values of a greater whole.
Historically any DES implementation that used 7 bytes wasn't compatible where there are several FIPS/Nist pubs specifying key/ciphertext/plaintext triplets.
If you have a need for a 56 bit number representing a key there's an implication you're using or storing them in a tabular fashion.  Otherwise you could simply guarantee the parity bit is either correct or say '0'.  'Packed' keys are only of interest for saving storage space.
All that said and done if you need a 56 bit number representing a key you could represent 8 bytes of key in a 64 bit value and after identifying the parity bit locations with respect to endian-ness, shift the 64 bit array value obliterating the parity bits one at a time in 8 operations on a 64 bit machine, leaving 56 'effective' key bits.
On a 32 bit or smaller machine you'd also have to track byte position to keep track of bit shift offsets and would have to deal with bits moving between bytes to pack bits into 7 bytes.
For a 32 bit machine you could pack two 32 bit values into 28 bits in opposite directions then merge the proper 4 bits of the second one into the first followed by shifting the second value down 8 bits.
For a big-endian bit in byte numbering system 1 to 8 with bit 8 the LSB (from the standard)
Bits 1-4 go to the C register, with only four  bit 4 values from 8 successive bytes of an input key (described as an input array of bits).  The D block shares bit 4 and uses bits 5-7 to derived 28 bits:

The bigger issue here may be the ability to communicate any interesting finding in terms of keys useful to those dealing with an 8 byte key representation.  It may be handy to have an inverse function available as well.
There's also a relationship between round keys and the C and D concatenated block, shown in Carl Meyers and Stephen Metyas book ""Cryptography, A New Dimension in Computer Security', subtitled 'A Guide for the Design and Implementation of Secure Systems', Wiley Interscience, 1982, ISBN-0-471- 04892-5.
I recreated the table using a derivative of the original BSD libcrypt source.  The significance of this is that C and D bits don't mix in the two 24 bit values derived from Permuted Choice 2 (which is visible in selected key (KS) in round 16 of the table).

This almost says your 56 bit number should be concatenated from the C and D Register values so there's a discernible relationship with round keys while allowing you to index based on C and/or D values.

Could anyone help me understand what is going on here:
Why does Node.js produces result which is twice longer ?
","I figured it out.
This happens because of different  behavior of Pythons' PyCrypto package and Nodes' Crypto module. I am using AES, and since it is a block cypher, it requires data to come in chunks of specified length.
PyCrypto fails if it encounters data which doesn't come in 16 bit chunks. Nodes' Crypto, by default will pad data, so data will always come in chunks of good size.
For the sake of simplicity i've tested data having length of 16 bytes in the examples above. So why were the results different?
Python module did not pad data by default, and because data contained correct length, we've got expected result.
Node Crypto module, however, does pad the data, and apparently adds the whole 16 bit chunk of padding to original message (which really sounds like a bug). That is why the first part of encrypted Nodes' message corresponds to the one created in Python, the other one is just Node Crypto trying to encrypt its own excessive padding.
Anyway, to get rid of the error, i've simply added
 aes.setAutoPadding(false);

in my encrypt() function.
Wooh.

","As t.m.adam noted, the CBC mode of operation requires an initialization vector (IV) to work. Because the IV is commonly forgotten (also that it has to be unique and unpredictable, e.g. random), Pycryptodome creates a random one when a cipher object is initialized.

from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad, unpad

# Do not use raw passwords as keys,
# use a derivation functions to generate keys from them
key = b'Sixteen byte key'  
data = 'Jeevan B Manoj'.encode(""UTF-8"")
data = pad(data, AES.block_size)
encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC)
iv = encryptor.IV
decryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV=iv)

ciphertext = encryptor.encrypt(data)
plaintext = decryptor.decrypt(ciphertext)

assert plaintext == data

Important note: The ciphertext and IV must be authenticated for security (so data cannot be tampered with). For that, Pycryptodome offers AEAD modes like EAX and GCM as pointed out by Hans-Peter Jansen on GitHub. For many of them padding is not required.

Update2:
I'm not providing an IV in python code, the python module ignores IV. I the IV thing is what causing the problem.
","As I read their source codes I can say PyCrypto and Crypto++ Both are perfect libraries for cryptography for Python and C++. The problem was that I was prefixing the encrypted data with some meta information about file and I totally forgot about that, after handling these meta data in client Crypto++ decrypted my files.
As I didn't find this documented explicitly anywhere (not even in Wikipedia) I write it here:
Any combination of Nonce, IV and Counter like concatenation, xor, or likes will work for CTR mode, but the standard that most libraries implement is to concatenate these values in order. So the value that is used in block cipher algorithm is usually: Nonce + IV + Counter. And counter usually starts from 1 (not 0).

","Compression works by identifying patterns in the data. Since you can't identify patterns in encrypted data (that's the whole point), you can't compress it.
For a perfect encryption algorithm that produced a 33,742 byte output, ideally all you would be able to determine about the decrypted original data is that it can fit in 33,742 bytes, but no more than that. If you could compress it to, say, 31,400 bytes, then you would immediately know the input data was not, say, 32,000 bytes of random data since random data is patternless and thus incompressible. That would indicate a failure on the part of the encryption scheme. It's nobody's business whether the decrypted data is random or not.

","The compression method used by tar -z relies on repeating patterns in the input file, replacing these patterns by a count of how many times the pattern repeated (grossly simplified).
However, when you encrypt a file, you are basically trying to hide any repeating patterns in as much 'random'-looking noise as possible. That makes your file nearly incompressible. Combine that with the overhead of the archive and compression file format (metadata, etc.) and your file actually ends up slightly larger instead.
You should reverse the process; compress first, then encrypt, and you'll increase the chances you end up with a smaller payload significantly.

message_dict = {

I did a json.dumps of the above and encrypted with B's public key. After I decrypt it, I do not get the same message. I noticed that it goes wrong only if I include client_pub_key in the dict.
I have been looking for answers online and this is possibly why it might be going wrong:

The message is too long to encrypt with B's public key
The client_pub_key has special characters which leads to a situation where JSON encoding is messed up

I tried the following:

Used pickle instead of JSON
Used binascii.hexlify to encode client_pub_key
Used base64.b64encode to encode client_pub_key
Used Crypto.Util.RFC1751.key_to_english to convert to some characters client_pub_key
Set B's key 2048 bytes and A's key 1024 bytes

All my above efforts failed. Hence I'm here looking for help.
My Question: How do I encrypt a message of the above dict format so I can send it over to the server? 
(I'm using thrift's TTornadoStreamTransport and TBinaryProtocol, if that helps)

client_key = RSA.generate(1024)

  'hostname': socket.getfqdn(),
  'request': 'MY_REQUEST',
  'client_pub_key': int(binascii.hexlify(client_key.publickey().exportKey()),16),
}

another_key = RSA.generate(2048)

decrypted = another_key.decrypt(encrypted)
print '\n\nMESSAGE: {0}'.format(decrypted)

result = json.loads(decrypted)
print '\n\nDICT: {0}'.format(result)
# result should be same message_dict

","Your problem will be, that the message which you try to encrypt should be never larger than the n-modulo!
Because:
cipher = message ** e (mod N)
If your message is numerically larger than the RSA module (in your case 2048 BITS - not Bytes), you won't get the correct ciphertext, and decription will never work. (mathematically)
In your case this happens.
You should be careful, because I guess, that after the json.dumps() the message should not larger than (in your case of the 2048bit another_key) 2048//8 = 256 bytes long - you can test it after json.dumps() via len(message).
In your abovementioned example the length of your message will be larger than 700 bytes... and 700 > 256.
Just to show the meaning of this:
first try a message with exactly 256bytes of length:
>>> import json
>>> from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
>>> another_key = RSA.generate(2048)
>>> message_dict = {'t':'a'*248}
>>> message = json.dumps(message_dict)
>>> len(str(message))
256
>>> enc = another_key.publickey().encrypt(message, 32)[0]
>>> dec = another_key.decrypt(enc)

You will see, in this example the length of the message is exactly 256 bytes (not bits, but 256*8 = 2048 bits) long - and it works fine!
But now let us try a length of 257 bytes (more than the length of the n modulo (2048 bits = 256 bytes):
>>> import json
>>> from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
>>> another_key = RSA.generate(2048)
>>> message_dict = {'t':'a'*249}
>>> message = json.dumps(message_dict)
>>> len(str(message))
257
>>> enc = another_key.publickey().encrypt(message, 32)[0]
>>> dec = another_key.decrypt(enc)

In this case dec != enc - because the message is numerically larger than the n modulo.
If you will mathematically understand the reason for this, take a look in the meaning of ""cipher = message ** e (mod N)"" ;)

","You can't generally read from and write to a file at the same time.
So, you have two basic options.

First, you can read into memory, then encrypt, then write back out. Hopefully you have an encrypt function that works on strings rather than files. Since you've tagged this pycrypto, and all of its engines work on strings, this should be trivial. But if you have to use files, you can usually use BytesIO (or, for 2.x, cStringIO.StringIO), which wraps up a byte string in a file-like object, like this:
def encrypt_file(path, password):
    temp = io.BytesIO()
    with open(path, 'rb') as in_file:
        encrypt(in_file, temp, password)
    with open(path, 'wb') as out_file:
        out_file.write(temp.getvalue())

This is dead simple, but of course it could be a problem if your files are gigantic.

Or you can write to a NamedTemporaryFile, then replace the original file with the temporary:
def encrypt_file(path, password):
    dir = os.path.dirname(path)
    with open(path, 'rb') as in_file, tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(dir=dir, delete=False) as out_file:
        encrypt(in_file, temp, password)
    os.replace(temp.name, path)

This has some major advantages over the other method—it doesn't necessarily take a ton of memory (that depends on how encrypt is written), and there's no chance of leaving behind a partially-written file if you pull the plug (os.replace is atomic—it either happens completely, or not at all). But it's a little more complicated. And, before Python 3.3, there was no replace function. On Unix, rename works just as well. On Windows… well, that's a whole mess.

","Ok, let's fix a few things that are wrong with your code. First the most obvious one - your padding would break on Python 3.5+ (and your user 'menu' would break on 2.x) because infile.read() would give you bytes array so trying to add a string formed by chunk += ' ' * (16 - (len(chunk) % 16)) would result in an error. You would need to convert your whitespace pad to bytes array first:  chunk += b' ' * (16 - (len(chunk) % 16))
But whitespace padding like this is a bad idea - when you're later decrypting your file how will you know how much, if any, padding you've added? You need to store this somewhere - and you do in the 'header' via the filesize value, telling a potential attacker how exactly big is your file and how much padding was added opening you to a padding oracle attack (which is possible with the bellow code so do not use it for passing messages without adding a proper MAC to it).
There are plenty of robust padding schemes that you can use - I personally prefer PKCS#7 which is simply padding your uneven block or adding a whole new block with n number of bytes with the value of n - that way, after decryption, you can pick the last byte from your block and know exactly how many bytes were padded so you can strip them. So, replace your encryption portion with:
def encrypt(key, filename):

I've also changed your chunksize to match the block size you're using (multiples of AES.block_size) - it just happens that 64 is a multiple of 16 but you should pay attention to those things.
Now that we have the encryption sorted out, the decryption is all this but in reversal - decrypt all blocks, read the last byte of the last block and remove n amount of bytes from behind matching the value of the last byte:
def decrypt(key, filename):
    outputfile = filename[:-11] + ""(decrypted)""
    chunksize = 1024 * AES.block_size  # use the cipher's defined block size as a multiplier
    with open(filename, 'rb') as infile:

        with open(outputfile, 'wb') as outfile:
            old_chunk = b''  # stores last chunk, needed for reading data with a delay
            stripped = False
            while not stripped:  # delayed loop until the last block is stripped
                chunk = decryptor.decrypt(infile.read(chunksize))  # decrypt as we read
                if len(chunk) == 0:  # no more data
                    padding = old_chunk[-1]  # pick the padding value from the last byte
                    if old_chunk[-padding:] != bytes([padding]) * padding:
                        raise ValueError(""Invalid padding..."")
                    old_chunk = old_chunk[:-padding]  # strip the padding
                    stripped = True

What is the format of ciphertext[0]? I thought it was utf-8 but it fails when I try. 
I am using Debian 64bits, python 2.7, just in case. 
","It's encrypted text. It's just a stream of bytes.
If you want to send it as text, use base64 or something similar.

And one more thing. It is not directly related to your question, but it is very important. You are using RSA in a very wrong way. Your code is totally insecure.
The right thing to do is generate a fixed-length random key and use it for symmetric encryption (I'd suggest AES in CTR mode) of your data. Then you should use PKCS#1-OAEP at the beginning of your session only to establish this key.

","MySQL is trying to store your byte string in a character column. Because the connection character set is UTF-8 but the byte string doesn't represent a valid UTF-8 sequence, it gets mangled.
To get raw bytes into the database properly you need to:

make the column a BINARY type (or generally character type with a binary collation), and
use parameterised queries to get the data into the database instead of interpolating them into the query string where they might mix with non-binary (Unicode) content.

You should use parameterised queries anyway because the string interpolation you're using now, with no escaping, is vulnerable to SQL injection. In web.py that might look like:
query_string= 'INSERT INTO %s (%s) VALUES ($value)' % (table, column)
db.query(query_string, vars= {'value': value})

(assuming that the table and column values are known-good.)
Doing it like this also means you don't have to worry about the dollar sign.
The other approach is to use a normal character string, encoding away the non-ASCII bytes. You're doing this with uucode in your current workaround, but base64 would be a more common alternative that's easier to get to in Python (ciphertext.encode('base64')). Hex encoding (.encode('hex')) is most common for the case of a hash.

","I think you are putting a lot of effort into stuff, that doesn't need to be handled by Django.
Here is what I would usually do:

Use HTTPS, as transport encryption layer
Use HTTP Basic Auth. Basic auth is implemented in urllib2 as well as requests.

But there is an even better solution: Django REST framework
It provides you will a full blown REST API including different authentication solutions.
If you need any help, setting up one of these options, let me know and I'll add an example.

","You are very close to decrypting the values on the server. The result of the encryption on the client is a tuple. When you urllib2.unquote the items on the server, you then recreate tuples from them.
For example:
>>> c = public.encrypt('Hello', ""ignored"")
>>> c
('3\xae0\x1f\xd7\xe4b\xd4\xf1\xf4\x88!Be\xff!\x1e\xda\x82\x10\x9bRy\x0c\xa0v\xed\x84\xf9\xe35\xc6QG\xcf\xb7\x1b\xea\x9fe\t\x9b\x8d\xd6\xf3\x8cw\xde\x17\xb5\xf7\x9a+\x84i%@\x8a\xdf\xf4\xdd\xc8wY',)

which in your code you pack into params like this:
>>> params = { ""message"" : c }
>>> params
{'message': ('3\xae0\x1f\xd7\xe4b\xd4\xf1\xf4\x88!Be\xff!\x1e\xda\x82\x10\x9bRy\x0c\xa0v\xed\x84\xf9\xe35\xc6QG\xcf\xb7\x1b\xea\x9fe\t\x9b\x8d\xd6\xf3\x8cw\xde\x17\xb5\xf7\x9a+\x84i%@\x8a\xdf\xf4\xdd\xc8wY',)}
>>> urllib.urlencode(params)
'message=%28%273%5Cxae0%5Cx1f%5Cxd7%5Cxe4b%5Cxd4%5Cxf1%5Cxf4%5Cx88%21Be%5Cxff%21%5Cx1e%5Cxda%5Cx82%5Cx10%5Cx9bRy%5Cx0c%5Cxa0v%5Cxed%5Cx84%5Cxf9%5Cxe35%5Cxc6QG%5Cxcf%5Cxb7%5Cx1b%5Cxea%5Cx9fe%5Ct%5Cx9b%5Cx8d%5Cxd6%5Cxf3%5Cx8cw%5Cxde%5Cx17%5Cxb5%5Cxf7%5Cx9a%2B%5Cx84i%25%40%5Cx8a%5Cxdf%5Cxf4%5Cxdd%5Cxc8wY%27%2C%29'

I would guess that urllib2.unquote(p[""message""]) returns this (but I did not try this):
""('3\\xae0\\x1f\\xd7\\xe4b\\xd4\\xf1\\xf4\\x88!Be\\xff!\\x1e\\xda\\x82\\x10\\x9bRy\\x0c\\xa0v\\xed\\x84\\xf9\\xe35\\xc6QG\\xcf\\xb7\\x1b\\xea\\x9fe\\t\\x9b\\x8d\\xd6\\xf3\\x8cw\\xde\\x17\\xb5\\xf7\\x9a+\\x84i%@\\x8a\\xdf\\xf4\\xdd\\xc8wY',)""

then you can recreate the tuple at the server like this (m is the unquoted message):
>>> from ast import literal_eval
>>> literal_eval(m)
('3\xae0\x1f\xd7\xe4b\xd4\xf1\xf4\x88!Be\xff!\x1e\xda\x82\x10\x9bRy\x0c\xa0v\xed\x84\xf9\xe35\xc6QG\xcf\xb7\x1b\xea\x9fe\t\x9b\x8d\xd6\xf3\x8cw\xde\x17\xb5\xf7\x9a+\x84i%@\x8a\xdf\xf4\xdd\xc8wY',)

once you have the tuple back, you can decrypt it:
>>> private.decrypt(literal_eval(m))
'Hello'

It would be better to find a vetted and standard mechanism to do this rather than roll your own. For example, in your scheme, I could capture different messages between the client and server, and then mix and match messages and username/password pairs, making it appear that the messages came from different users.
However, with just this minor tweak (recreating the tuples from the ""unquoted"" strings) your code should decrypt just fine.

I would thank you very much for your help.
","Short answer (TL;DR):
The decrypt() method is returning your random_generator function.
Details
If you type
help(PKCS1_v1_5.PKCS115_Cipher.decrypt)

you can read this from the official documentation:  
decrypt(self, ct, sentinel) method of 
Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_v1_5.PKCS115_Cipher instance
Decrypt a PKCS#1 v1.5 ciphertext.

[...]    

:Parameters:
[...]
 sentinel : any type
        The object to return to indicate that an error was detected  
        during decryption.

As you can read from above, if there is an error during decryption then the sentinel object is returned instead of a byte string, then in your code the decrypt() method would return the random_generator function.   
This is why your text variable is a function and you cannot treat it as a byte string.
Further note
I think there is no need to pass a random generator to decrypt() as a sentinel object, because it is just a sentinel object used to detect errors. Please see the PyCrypto documentation to learn more about this library (but also read this and this and consider using PyCryptodome instead).

","In the Python code, the following is entirely unnecessary and should be removed:
encrypted = str(cipher.encrypt(plaintext))
encrypted = encrypted[2:-1]

In your PowerShell code, you need to use PKCS7 instead of Zeros for the padding.
In the PowerShell code you don't implement the key padding with zeros anywhere. This is required (I'm not sure how you get this to work at all without it).

Since the padding is randomized, you cannot compare the ciphertext of both. You need to encrypt in one and decrypt in the other to see if the same hash is produced.

","Strings (str) are text. Encryption does not deal in text, it deals in bytes (bytes).
In practice insert .encode and .decode calls where necessary to convert between the two. I recommend UTF-8 encoding.
In your case since you are already encoding and decoding the ciphertext as base-64 which is another bytes/text conversion, you only need to encode and decode your plaintext. Encode your string with .encode(""utf-8"") when passing it into the encryption function, and decode the final result with .decode(""utf-8"") when getting it out of the decryption function.
If you're reading examples or tutorials make sure they are for Python 3. In Python 2 str was a byte string and it was commonplace to use it for both text and bytes, which was very confusing. In Python 3 they fixed it.

I went through other post as well on stack regarding this issue but, it doesn't worked out as they have used different mode.
","In python, you're storing the iv (initialization vector) in the first 16 bytes of the encrypted message. 
In Java, you're doing no such thing - you're passing an empty IV and you treat the whole message including the first 16 bytes as ciphertext.
You need to make sure that Java and Python match up.
Either you don't use an IV in both, in which case you remove that part in Python. 
Or you use an IV in both, in which case you need to update your Java code to generate a random IV on encryption, adding it to the result of the encryption. On decryption, the Java code needs to take the first 16 bytes as the IV and pass it to the Cipher.

'\x88\xc5\xe4\xa0c?\xf8\x16|^1JB\x83{\xdf'
print(encrypted_fields[3].field_enc)
���c?�|^1JB�{�

So, now when I try to take this same value to decrypt it, the mysql replies with an error that says 

""OperationalError: (1300, ""Invalid utf8 character string:
  '\x88\xC5\xE4\xA0c'"")""

I guess this is because I tried to send unprintable characters to the mysql query.  
So, how do I approach this?
Please note that I have to use the MySQL functions because I encrypted some database fields using these functions so I need to decrypt them with the same function because Crypto's AES doesn't get the same results. Crypto keeps asking that the text to be encrypted has to be 16 bytes long like the key, while mysql doesn't require that.  
I also tried to see if mysql use some kind of padding for the text before encryption but it doesn't say what characters they pad on their webpage:  

The str and crypt_str arguments can be any length, and padding is
  automatically added to str so it is a multiple of a block as required
  by block-based algorithms such as AES. This padding is automatically
  removed by the AES_DECRYPT() function

","After many googles, I found this blog article about replicating mysql AES Encryption in PHP.
They key turned out to be that the character used for padding is the character that has an ascii code equal to the difference in length between the AES block size and the length of the text.  
c = chr(16 - len(text_to_be_encrypted))
def align_str(s, n, char):
    if len(s) < n:
        diff = n - len(s)
        for i in range(diff):
            s += char
    return s
s = align_str(text_to_be_encrypted, 16, c)
e = encryption_suite.encrypt(s)

and it worked. It produced the same output as mysql encryption.

","You are using Python 2 - bytes is synonymous to str. str(i) returns a byte string ""('a', 'e', 's', '1', 'x', 'e')"" instead of 'aes1xe'; to get the latter, use ''.join(i)

","At decryption time, you initialize the CBC cipher once and then decrypt all rows with it, one after the other.
I believe you do not do that at encryption time. In other words, you might be initializing the CBC cipher four times, right before encrypting each line.
The fix is to move obj2 creation inside the first loop in the decryption code.
On a separate note, the IV for CBC should be random, not take a fixed value.

To send a key for the encrypted data to the receiver the program uses RSA public key encryption and decryption on a randomly generated key.  
Below is the encryption and decryption methods in the python script I have used to encrypt and decrypt a key with public/private keys:  
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP

def encrypt_public_key(msg, public_key):
    cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(public_key)
    return cipher.encrypt(msg)

def decrypt_private_key(msg, private_key):
    cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(private_key)
    return cipher.decrypt(msg)

My program should communicate with a classmates program, however, this person has written his program as a bash script using the following command to encrypt and decrypt:
openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey id_rsa.pub.pem -pubin -in key.bin -out key.bin.enc
openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey id_rsa.pem -in key.bin.enc -out key.bin 

When my program tries to decrypt my classmates encrypted key I get this error:
File ""[script-path]"", line 54, in decrypt_private_key
return cipher.decrypt(msg)
File ""C:\[path_to_python]\Python37-32\lib\site-packages\Crypto\Cipher\PKCS1_OAEP.py"", line 167, in decrypt
    raise ValueError(""Ciphertext with incorrect length."")
ValueError: Ciphertext with incorrect length.

I believe that this means that our scripts does not use the same cipher, am I correct with this assumtion? However, I cannot find which cipher is used for the bash script (and my classmate does not know either) and I am struggling to find how I can use another cipher with the python Crypto module.
I have tried to switch my encryption and decryption methods to something similar to this:
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

def encrypt_public_key(msg, public_key):
    return public_key.encrypt(msg, 32)
def decrypt_private_key(msg, private_key):
    return private_key.decrypt(msg)

But this gives me the following error:
File ""[script_path]"", line 52, in decrypt_private_key
    return private_key.decrypt(msg)
  File ""[python-path]\Python37-32\lib\site-packages\Crypto\PublicKey\RSA.py"", line 378, in decrypt
    raise NotImplementedError(""Use module Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEP instead"")
NotImplementedError: Use module Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEP instead

Which is the cipher (PKCS1_OAEP) that is not working with the encrypted key from my classmate. 
Do you have any suggestions on what I can do to solve this? Is the problem that we are using different ciphers and is there a way to switch my cipher or do I have to switch from my python Crypto module? 
","You are probably using different RSA padding schemes. 
Maybe your classmate could try using the rsautl OAEP padding option -oaep. 
It seems the default padding mode for openssl rsautl is -pkcs (PKCS#1 v1.5).
So alternatively, you could try using: 
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_v1_5

On the hardware RSASSA_PSS with SHA256 data hash and MGF1 SHA1 identifier is used.
I get a valid signature response from the signature generated by pycrypto while the signature seems to be invalid in case of cryptography module.
The below implementation is for pycrpto:
from Crypto.Hash import SHA256
from Crypto.Signature import PKCS1_PSS
import binascii

string = ""ABCD""
message = bytes.fromhex(string)
digest = SHA256.new()
digest.update(message)
print(digest.hexdigest())
private_key = False

with open (""RSATest_private.pem"", ""rb"") as myfile:
    private_key = RSA.importKey(myfile.read())

# Load private key and sign message
signer = PKCS1_PSS.new(private_key)
sig = signer.sign(digest)
print(binascii.hexlify(sig))

and the below implementation is for cryptogrpahy module:
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import utils
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
import binascii

digestAlg_obj = hashes.SHA256()
digest_obj = hashes.Hash(self.digestAlg_obj, backend = default_backend())
digest_obj.update(bytes.fromhex('ABCD'))
digest_bytv = digest_obj.finalize()
print(binascii.hexlify(sha256_data))

with open(RSATest_private.pem, ""rb"") as key_file:
    self.prvKey_obj = serialization.load_pem_private_key(key_file.read(),password=None,backend=default_backend())
signature_bytv = self.prvKey_obj.sign(digest_bytv,padding.PSS(mgf = padding.MGF1(hashes.SHA1()),salt_length=padding.PSS.MAX_LENGTH),utils.Prehashed(hashes.SHA256()))
print(binascii.hexlify(signature_bytv))

I understand that the signatures obtained are not the same due to the randomness involved in the generation for PSS algorithm. The algorithm setting in both the cases is the same.
The HASH value from SHA256 for the data match in both the modules, but the signature generated when checked on the hardware returns invalid in case of cryptography module.
 
Is something wrong with the parameter usage in case of cryptography module?
From the documentation of the pycrypto module, I see that SHA1 is used for mgf1 and the salt length also equals the maximum length of the hash algorithm.
So using the same values in cryptography module should provide me a valid signature.
Also verifying the signature generated by cryptography APIs return sign invalid when checked using the corresponding public key with the pycrypto APIs.
I have tried to generate signature with mgf1 with hash Alg of sha256 as well just to check with the latest predominant embedded hardware implementations but with no progress here as well.
Used python3.6, pycrypto v2.6.1 and cryptography v2.2.2
","The issue seems is solved :)
For anyone facing a similar issue, the default hash alg in MGF1 function in pycrypto or OPENSSL for RSASSA-PSS is SHA256 and a salt_length equal to the digest length of the data.
So changing the MGF1 algorithm to hashes.SHA256() and salt_length to 32 solved the problem.

"25688535","Django EncryptedCharField Error When Editing Value","Here's one for my Django comrades. 
I am trying to build an application in Django 1.6.5 and MySQL where some database fields are encrypted in order to respect the privacy of users.  I have successfully installed django-extensions and successfully used the EncryptedCharField to do a simple save and data retrieval.
However, I am running into a problem when using EncryptedCharField for floats.  Now, simple typecasting has been useful--this problem doesn't seem to be that problem.  I'm trying to start with an encrypted field that is a value, change the value by adding/subtracting some number, then save the back to the database.  I've managed to reduce and reproduce the error like this:
>>> user_id = 1
>>> account = AccountCash.objects.get( id = 1 )
>>> account.id
1L
>>> account.portfolio_id
1L
>>> account.account_name
u'My Cash'
>>> account.current_value
u'200'
>>> account.current_value = account.current_value - 10
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<console>"", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'unicode' and 'int'

Here, account_name and current_value are both EncryptedCharFields.  We see that current_value is a unicode, so typecasting to a float should (I thought) resolve the issue, as it has for me in other places.  
However, doing so leads to another problem in 
>>> account.current_value = float(account.current_value) - 10
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<console>"", line 1, in <module>
  File ""/Users/jasonnett/anaconda/envs/bb_env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/db/models/fields/subclassing.py"", line 35, in __set__

    elif value and (value.startswith(self.prefix)):
AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute 'startswith'

I haven't been able to figure out what is different about assigning a float value to the encrypted field here vs. where I originally set the value like this:
        # Make the new account, passing in the portfolio it belongs to
        new_account = AccountCash(
            portfolio                   = portfolio,

            starting_balance            = newCashAccountForm.cleaned_data['starting_balance'],
            current_value               = newCashAccountForm.cleaned_data['starting_balance'],

Not normal. With PKCS#1 v1.5 the signature should always be the same with the same private key.
Check the following:

The SHA256 hash is exactly the same on both ends
I'm not a Python expert, but it also seems weird that you are calling RSA.generate() when you already have key

Given that your Python code is giving different signature every time, I would concentrate my investigation on that part. If a single byte is different in the input data the produced hash is different - so check with your Python code if the hash is changing with the same input data.

I've noticed one strange thing in python code, that is, when ever I generate a signature with fixed private key, the signature is not the same. Is this normal ? but in JS it gives me fixed signature every time. 
Note: There is a little bug in JS DEMO sample page,go to the source code and change rsa.signString to rsa.sign. And also, change rsa.verifyString to rsa.verify. I've raised this issue in his Github, he said he'll gona fix it shortly.  
","Someone posted an answer, suggesting me to check python code and told that its NOT normal to get different signature for fixed private key. I don't know for what reason he deleted the answer, but his observation was right. Actually the way I was getting the key pairs in python is totally wrong. I am generating new key pair every time and exporting it to local variable pub_key & priv_key. Instead I should do something like this;
#key = RSA.generate(2048)
#pub_key = RSA.publickey().exportKey(public_key) 
priv_key = RSA.importKey(private_key)
pub_key = RSA.importKey(public_key)

In this way, I get same signature for this fixed private key, and it really matches the signature of JS code :D ...

Assume both the public and private keys are available and in place.
And, when I execute the below command after some time of execution I get the error: Ciphertext with incorrect length without any traceback:

But it runs successful for lesser data input, like 40G of data

I have installed PyCrypto 2.3 (for 32-bit python 2.7) using the installer found on VoidSpace:
http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#pycrypto
When I attempt to import the PyCrypto module via the interpreter, it works perfectly. I then run the Django server using: manage.py runserver
This also is performing as expected, the CSS and other static images do not show properly, but the site is working properly. 
When using mod_wsgi and Apache I instead get a import error, and a note that the DLL's failed to load.
The full stacktrace has been posted on pastebin:
http://pastebin.com/hav7sqB0
I used DependencyWalker to see what dependencies  that may be missing, and downloaded all of the DLL's that appeared to be missing. Those were then copied to both the System32 windows directory, and SysWOW64 directories.
The DependencyWalker app now shows only ""Delayed"" dependency errors, but nothing to block functionality.
I did see the related issue:

I have installed PyCrypto 2.3 (for 32-bit python 2.7) using the installer found on VoidSpace:
http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#pycrypto
When I attempt to import the PyCrypto module via the interpreter, it works perfectly. I then run the Django server using: manage.py runserver
This also is performing as expected, the CSS and other static images do not show properly, but the site is working properly. 
When using mod_wsgi and Apache I instead get a import error, and a note that the DLL's failed to load.
The full stacktrace has been posted on pastebin:
http://pastebin.com/hav7sqB0
I used DependencyWalker to see what dependencies  that may be missing, and downloaded all of the DLL's that appeared to be missing. Those were then copied to both the System32 windows directory, and SysWOW64 directories.
The DependencyWalker app now shows only ""Delayed"" dependency errors, but nothing to block functionality.

I run my code in my local Mac Environment and it works perfectly, but when I upload my package to AWS Lambda and test it, I get the following error:
Unable to import module 'lambda_function': cannot import name '_AES'

I checked this question and downloaded the pycrypto package from this git repo, made the build and copied the results to my lambda folder, packaged it and still didn't work.
I checked the result of the build and I noticed that within this folder:
pycrypto-2.6.1/build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.7/Crypto/Cipher

The AES files are generated with an extension related to my Mac OS

I tried building the package on a Linux EC2 instance, but still get the same error (although the files change)

I tried a new path based on the following question but still failed with the exact same error.
"errorMessage": "Unable to import module 'lambda_function'"
Why is AWS Lambda not able to read the AES module in the pycrypto package? I have deployed Lambda function with other external libraries and never faced this issue. 
","This worked for me now using python2: 
https://www.github.com/Doerge/awslambda-pycrypto 
I just downloaded this project and zipped my lambda_function.py file with both the Crypto and pycrypto-2.6.1.dist-info folders.
I see that the compiled .so files in Crypto/Cipher/ (like _AES.so) lack the python version and OS architecture and distribution that mine had (i.e: AES.cpython-27m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so). I will update my answer if I find a way to build the package properly by myself rather than using a third person compiled library.

"27810325","Import Public Key from GameCenter using PyCrypto on Google App Engine","I'm trying to verify a GameCenter player on a remote server using Apple's documented method:
GKLocalPlayer generateIdentityVerificationSignatureWithCompletionHandler:

Calling this method on iOS returns, among other things, a link to this file (this file location is fairly static, and you can download it to see its contents):
https://sandbox.gc.apple.com/public-key/gc-sb.cer

This file holds the public key that must be downloaded on the server to begin the verification process for the local GameCenter player.
I am using Google App Engine for my project, which limits me to using the PyCrypto library.  I am trying to import this file using these calls (I use the filename directly here for clarity):
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA 

apple_cert = urllib2.urlopen(""https://sandbox.gc.apple.com/public-key/gc-sb.cer"").read()
rsakey = RSA.importKey(apple_cert) 

Unfortunately, this is failing with the following message:
raise ValueError(""RSA key format is not supported"")

From what I understand, PyCrypto is expecting a DER formatted certificate, which is what I think Apple is supplying.  Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong, or can point me in the right direction?  Thanks.
Also, I have setup my GAE project to use the latest version of PyCrypto, which I think is 2.6.  
The process of getting GameCenter authentication working with Google App Engine is proving to  be very troublesome.
","As it turns out, the reason is because the file downloaded from Apple is actually an X.509 certificate.  The public key has to be extracted from this certificate before it can be used.  This answer is demonstrated in a similar post:
How do I use a X509 certificate with PyCrypto?

","Perhaps sign a hash of the transaction. At verification time you can take the hash again verify that.
Regarding the signing of messages, the documentation says:

The piece of data to sign with RSA. It may not be numerically larger
  than the RSA module (n).

Watch out though. The documentation for sign and verify says:

Attention: this function performs the plain, primitive RSA encryption
  (textbook). In real applications, you always need to use proper
  cryptographic padding, and you should not directly verify data with
  this method. Failure to do so may lead to security vulnerabilities. It
  is recommended to use modules Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_PSS or
  Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_v1_5 instead.

"55586710","how to encrypt decrypt data between angular app and django app","We are having a scenario in which our angular app calls our backend APIs (developed using django rest framework). We are using Jwt for API authentication. We have one endpoint url which takes username and password (POST request) and authenticate the user using django backends. We have deployed both the application on APACHE HTTP Server and using SSL (Https) for encryption. 
But we also want to encrypt the request payload (data sent to the django API). In current case encrypt the username and password from angular app and decrypt the corresponding data in django. For this, we are using CryptoJs in angular app and Pycrypto in Django. But we are unable to decrypt the data in django.
Here is the decrypt function code we are using on django app:
MODE = AES.MODE_CBC

key = 'k%eu6sy)h&vue#5yrpok#1)^1ya#l1t('

def decrypt(ciphertext,key, mode):
    encobj = AES.new('k%eu6sy)h&vue#5yrpok#1)^1ya#l1t(', AES.MODE_CBC)
    decrypted = encobj.decrypt(ciphertext)
    return decrypted.decode('utf-8')



ciphertext_user_name=request.data['username'].encode(""utf8"")
ciphertext_pwd=request.data['password'].encode(""utf8"")
usr = decrypt(ciphertext_user_name,key,MODE)
pwd = decrypt(ciphertext_pwd,key,MODE)


We are using CBC mode in CryptoJs as well. 
Above code is just a sample code. Can somebody suggest, is this the right approach to go, or we should change the approach and do something else.
Thanks in advance !
","
Can somebody suggest, is this the right approach to go

Why do you want to encrypting the payload separately (outside ssl)? 
When it comes to credentials (username, password), if you encrypt in the browser, you need to have a key inside the script somewhere. That doesn't add anything to security, only increases the solution complexity. 
You may use an asymmetric cipher (RSA, ECC) to encrypt data using server's public key. Oh, wait - HTTPS does that already for you.
Client side encryption may have its place where you don't want the server to access the data (e.g. secured messaging, password manager, ..), however for username and password the server needs to read and process the credentials anyway. 

But we are unable to decrypt the data in django.

Here we have no idea how do you encrypt data on the client side. You may try to edit your question and add the encryption code and error message

or we should change the approach and do something else

Though there are definitely some issues in your code (I am unable to tell if it's all of them)

ciphertext (encrypted data) are usually binary (having non-printable characters). That's why when passing as parameters, the data are usually encoded to printable common characters (hex, base64, ..). I see you directly decrypt the parameters, are you sure the data are not encoded / posted  correctly?
I see you are not using any IV (initialization vector for CBC mode). I assume you library used will just use zero array IV. Using static / zero IV is VERY unsafe for CBC mode (or any mode generally). Are you sure the client doesn't include some sort of IV? 
CBC mode is malleable, you should apply some integrity check (with the integrity secret in the client script it doesn't add any value either)

This all is already done (and done well) using HTTPS, so so you are just trying to implement another layer of encryption with not really added value (and as well with apparent weaknesses). I believe common advice here is to lean on HTTPS with confidence

"42568468","RSA : decrypt openSSL certificate","I am trying to decrypt an encrypted openSSL certificate using the Crypto library.
For that, I use the following function :
def decryptMessage(privateKeyString, encryptedMessage):

    print 'Enter private key pass phrase'
    passPhrase = raw_input()

    privateKey= RSA.importKey(privateKeyString, passPhrase)

    return privateKey.decrypt(ast.literal_eval(str(encryptedMessage)))

This function works fine with small strings such as foo or lorem ipsum.
However, when I try to decrypt a larger string such as an OpenSSL certificate, the decryption fails and returns this

Thus, I'd like to know how my function fails to decrypt bigger strings.
","RSA is for en/decrypting small chunks of data, e. g. a random number which is then used for en/decrypting the communication using a block cipher like AES.  Large chunks of data are simply not supported by asymmetric encryption algorithms like RSA.
Your approach seems to lack the knowledge needed for doing encryption right.  This is very dangerous.  I propose to have a look at the ""cryptography"" Python package which contains everything you will need: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cryptography
There are also some very nice Youtube videos of presentations before an audience the developers of this package made in which they explain how to use what and how they develop cryptography.

","You probably need gmp-devel installed, too. This gives pycrypto the headers it needs to build using libgmp.
On Ubuntu, I only had libgmp10 installed. I hit the same warning when trying to install pycrypto. After installing the Ubuntu package libgmp-dev, the warning went away and the build script indicated it was using the _fastmath extension.
If you already installed pycrypto without _fastmath, you can reinstall it with the -I flag, e.g.
sudo pip install -I pycrypto

"43799066","xoring bytes and str (AES CBC)","Hi I would really appreciate the help on this one since i'm really lost and I don't get why it's not working.
I have a 16 byte key and 16 byte block
but the key type is 'str' and the block type is 'bytes' and I want to xor between them but the value is incorrect(I think)
this code is based on this post
def xor(data, key):
  if type(key) != str:
    key = str(key)

  l = len(key)
  buff=""""
  for i in range(0,len(data)):
    buff+=chr(data[i]^ord(key[i]))
  return str.encode(buff)

and in context:(ref to CBC)
def CBC_decrypt(blocklist,IV,decrypter):
'''

:param blocklist: a 16 byte item list(or other iteratable)
:param IV: 16 byte sized iv
:param decrypter: decrypter: a generic decrypter-must provide an decrypt(plaintext) method
where plaintext is 16 byte size
:return:  a list of decrypted blocks of 16 bytes
'''
 decrypted_msg=[]

 prev = IV
 for x in blocklist:
     r = xor(decrypter.decrypt(x),prev)
     decrypted_msg.append(r)
     prev = x
 return decrypted_msg


a = FileTo16ByteBlocks(path) #just read 16 bytes at a time and return a list
cipher2= AES.new(loadKey(),AES.MODE_ECB) #init AES in ECB cause we had to implement CBC
d = CBC_decrypt(a,iv[0],cipher2)

and here i'm writing it all to the file 
# create new file iterate through the deciphered data and write it to that file
with open(str(fileSeq)+'.mp4','wb') as f:
    for i in d:
        f.write(i)
    f.write(b'')

I've tried other things regarding the xor (since the ECB decryption is made by the library-pycrypto) like using it's number.bytes to long and xoring that
and I've tried to cast it to ints and see how it goes, all goes really bad
and the xor thing is just a hunch I can't really lay my finger on why this is not working properly!
thanks for all the helpers
","I've managed to solve it!
the problem was indeed with the xor function as i thought, apparently the length of the result of the xor wasn't 16 but because of conversions it was variant(why is that though?)
I'm adding the code here incase anyone will need it in the future
def xor(data, key1):
  b=key1
  if type(key1) is str:
    b = bytes(key1,encoding='utf8')

  iData = int.from_bytes(data, sys.byteorder)
  iKey = int.from_bytes(b, sys.byteorder)
  xored = iData ^ iKey
  xored = xored.to_bytes(len(data), sys.byteorder)
  return xored

pt = unpad(cipher.decrypt(ct), AES.block_size)
print(""MSG:"", pt)

So here are my questions:

If i run it I get this Error: ValueError: Error 65537 while instantiating the CBC mode. It occurs when it runs line 8 (cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv) and i don't know why. I saw the other Question about that error, but there he tried to decrypt an input, that wasn't declarated, which doesn't seem to be the case here.
Solved: Like 'SquareRootOfTwentyThree' said, the length of my IV wasn't correct... Base64 encodes 8b to 6b. I will post the updated code with the (new) Questions under this.
from Cryptodome.Cipher import AES
from base64 import b64decode,b64encode

The task I have to solve says, the msg uses Zero-Byte-Padding (Null-Padding) and if I i run it i get Zero-Bytes at the end. So Can i assume the decryption gone right? Because the thing is, I cant read the secret out of the message..

Thank you in Advance!

Here is the complete sample code for BlowFIsh Encryption and Decryption, not sure what padding I need to add extra, I'm aware of the fact that BlowFISH  has a fixed data block size of 8 bytes and its keys can vary in length from 32 to 448 bits (4 to 56 bytes).
from Crypto.Cipher import Blowfish
from Crypto import Random
from struct import pack
bs = Blowfish.block_size

encryptedpass = ""myverystrongpassword""

iv = os.urandom(Blowfish.block_size)
bs = Blowfish.block_size


# ENcryption

plen = bs - divmod(len(plaintextMessage),bs)[1]
padding = [plen]*plen
padding = pack('b'*plen, *padding)
ct = iv + cipher.encrypt(plaintextMessage + padding)


#Decryption
cipher = Blowfish.new(encryptedpass, Blowfish.MODE_CBC, iv)
msg = cipher.decrypt(ct[bs:])

print msg

","You failed to remove the padding after decrypt. Your padding is 8 bytes of the ASCII character ""\x08"", also known as the backspace character. When you printed it your terminal dutifully ""backspaced"" over and erased the previous 8 characters which were ""wifi.org"".

","That's normal for cipher block chaining. In CBC decryption, the IV is only necessary to reconstruct the first block of plaintext. The computation of other blocks of plaintext doesn't actually involve the IV. Here's a diagram (source: Wikimedia user WhiteTimberwolf, public domain):

","You are missing one of the most important considerations in implementing crypto, which is message integrity. Unfortunately just encrypting a message isn't enough to ensure it isn't tampered with, especially in the case of streaming modes like CTR, CFB, and OFB. 
It looks like you are using CFB mode (MODE_CFB). The way this works is a random keystream is generated with AES, and the result is XOR-ed against the plaintext. This means that if someone flips a bit in the ciphertext, the corresponding bit will flip in the decrypted plaintext. An attacker could alter your message to mean something entirely different, and there'd be no way for you to detect it. For reference of how CFB mode (decryption) works:

If I flip the first bit of the first block of the ciphertext, it'll flip the first bit of the first block of the decrypted plaintext. 
You need to either apply an HMAC or use AES-GCM mode, which will handle confidentiality and integrity together. 
There are better mode choices than CFB, so if there's no strong reason for preferring it, I would recommend AES-GCM first, then AES-CTR with HMAC second.

I am currently using pyqtdeploy (version 1.2) together with PyQt 5.5.1 to write an application that can be deployed to an Android device. Without any external modules, the freezing with pyqtdeploy works pretty well. However, I am not really sure how I can add external modules (not pure Python ones) to my application. 
In particular, I want to add the external module pycrypto. Therefore, I downloaded the pycrypto sourcecode, compiled it with the Android toolchain (from the Android NDK) and now I have a bunch of *.py and *.so files. How can I add them to my application? 
My initial attempt was to add the *.py and the *.so files (so basically the whole pycrypto module) to the ""Other Packages"" tab in pyqtdeploy. 
But now, when I import something pycrypto related in my application (from Crypto.Cipher import AES) i get the following error message: 
File: "":/Crypto/Cipher/_AES.py"", line 20 in __bootstrap__
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable 
The _AES.py file where the error is thrown, looks like this:
def __bootstrap__():
   global __bootstrap__, __loader__, __file__
   import sys, pkgutil, imp
   __file__ = pkgutil.get_data(__name__,'_AES.cpython-34m.so')
   __loader__ = None; del __bootstrap__, __loader__
   imp.load_dynamic(__name__,__file__)
__bootstrap__()

At first I thought, that the *.so filename was just wrong and therefore, I got the NoneType Error, so I changed the filename in _AES.py to something other like 'test.so'. Surprisingly, now, I get a different error message than before:
File "":/pkgutil.py"" line 629, in get_data
ImportError: qrcimporter: error opening file :/Crypto/Cipher/test.so
Ok, so the filename should be fine, right? But why do i get the 'NoneType` error message? What am I doing wrong? Is this the right way to accomplish this? 
Any help is highly appreciated. I am pretty sure, that i'm only one small step away from getting this thing to work, but I can't figure out what i'm doing wrong.

","You use the app.yaml file to tell App Engine which libraries and versions you want to use only for those Third-party libraries available at the platform.
In your case, you want to use a version of the library that is not available, so you can't use that method to configure it.
Instead of that, you can upload to App Engine the libraries you want to use by following the method outlined in this other question:

To download the library and unzipped inside your GAE application directory. In this example, the destination directory is called pycrypto26.
To include the path to that library with something like

sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'pycrypto26/lib'))

Firstly, you are usine ECB this is insecure due to the relationship between text and its output being constant.
Secondly, CBC requires an IV hence a different implementation would be required.
Lastly and most crucially:
AES is NOT an asymmetric encryption algorithm
meaning that it must be encrypted and decrypted with the same key. You use the public and the private keys as you would with asymmetrical encryption methods.
An alternative:
If you were to implement RSA properly you could then generate a random byte array and use that as your key, then send it encrypted to the recipient to decrypt it and use it as the key to decrypt the aes as it would be the same.

Now:
You use the private key to sign the data... RSA  requires you to use the public key (now private - not distributed) to encrypt it however you cannot decrypt something encrypted with the private key with the public key. Instead you distribute the ‘private key’ for decryption and keep the ‘public key’ for encryption so no one else can encrypt or sign the data.
WHAT are you doing!
There is a relationship between public and private keys! You cannot just use random byte arrays.

"20418696","Increasing the diffusion of the AES-CBC encryption algorithm in pycrypto for python","When encryption is done using the AES-CBC algorithm, the encryption can be thought of as chaining the cipher texts with the previous ones and an IV. However, if its on CBC mode, we give our cipher text forward diffusive properties (i.e. if we change but i in our cipher, plaintext is change for all blocks after that). To make malleability attacks harder, one can chain the cipher texts during encryption on both directions (or implement something similar as in the bitLocker paper).
Does anyone know if there a implementation of pyCrypto that provides a chaining of the cipher texts using both direction?
One way that I thought of solving this was getting the original cipher text, reversing it using python and then feed it to pyCrypto. However, this seemed a little brute force because the whole point of pyCrypto is to take advantage of their C level implementation (while reversing a string would introduce a obvious unfortunate performance hit).
","No, as far as I know there are no modes in pyCrypto that do this. This strong diffusion of the plaintext after an error in the ciphertext is called error propagation. Error propagation is nowadays not considered that important anymore; if you want to provide integrity of the plaintext then you add a MAC (say, HMAC) over the ciphertext instead, or you use an authenticated cipher (which basically provides integrity on top of confidentiality). Unfortunately I didn't see any authenticated cipher modes in pyCrypto.

Looking at the documentation for PKCS1_OAEP.new

And then comparing with the JavaDoc for Cipher

Note that BC is the provider. I found out that BouncyCastle is popular and is included in the Android framework

TypeError

The TypeError is never specifically mentioned for some reason.
The error also does not show when running the server with the basic python application.py command on the default port 5000. When letting nginx and uwsgi handle the connections, I get the Internal Server Error shown above. Not really sure what's happening. All other non-crypto routes go through fine.
Update: running the server one level up in uwsgi with the following command will also work. Nginx still does not:
uwsgi --socket 0.0.0.0:8000 --protocol=http -w wsgi 

Update 2: Now getting another TypeError that's a little more descriptive but I still think the data being sent in the request is not being handled the same way/correctly with nginx as it is with uwsgi or flask.

The original error also stemmed from the password used in the crypto file. The password was retrieved from the system's environment variables. I later found out that Nginx doesn't come with any functionality to natively use environment variables but a workaround is explained here.

"54908486","PyCryptodome alternative for jython","I am trying to incorporate a simple encrypting processor for Apache Nifi. I am using the Script Processor module to include a Python script that does the function on encrypting and decrypting with AES. I am having trouble loading the module PyCryptodome (I also tried pycrypto), that was offering me the functionality. I have read that this module cannot be loaded as it is not pure python, which is, aparently, not supported by Nifi.
Any suggestion of what can I use as an alternative to this module?
","It's not that NiFi doesn't support native Python modules per se, rather it is the Jython engine that we use in NiFi (as NiFi is a pure Java implementation) that does not support it. If you have a Python interpreter on the node(s) running NiFi, you could use ExecuteStreamCommand to shell out to Python using your script (with native imports), you'd get the contents of the flow file as stdin and you'd write your encrypt/decrypt logic to output to stdout, which would become the contents of the outgoing flow file.
I'm looking into a Py4J processor so we can get around Jython's limitation on native modules, but you'd still have to Bring Your Own Python (BYOP). For now, as long as you don't want to do anything more complex than taking in flow file content and writing out flow file content, ExecuteStreamCommand should do the trick.

What I'm trying to do:
import base64, Crypto

publicKey = ""CAASpgIwgE ... jkupAgMBAAE=""
privateKey = ""CAASqQkwgg ... Xmzva/Km7A==""

publicKey = base64.b64decode(publicKey)
key = Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.import_key(publicKey)
crypter = Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEPPKCS1_OAEP.new(key)
encryptedData = crypter.encrypt(data.encode())
result = base64.b64encode(encryptedData).decode()

I get the following exception:
key = Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.importKey(publicKey)
  File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/Crypto/PublicKey/RSA.py"", line 754, in import_key
    raise ValueError(""RSA key format is not supported"")

Similar problem with privateKey. In what format is the key and how to convert it to an acceptable format? 
import_key function source code is there: https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome/blob/master/lib/Crypto/PublicKey/RSA.py#L682
","The solution was not as straightforward as it seemed to me at first glance.
For a start, you need to understand that the contents of the PrivateKey and PublicKey variables are not just a pure key encoded in Base64, it is a protobuf object serialized in ByteArray and then encoded in Base64. In order to get a key out of it, you first need to get a schema of this object, which is available by reference.
We save this file and follow the instructions on this page. In short, I ran the command protoc --python_out=. crypto.proto to create a Python module called crypto_pb2.py.
All preparations are complete and now go to the code:
import crypto_pb2
import base64

publicKey = ""CAASpgIwgE ... jkupAgMBAAE=""
privateKey = ""CAASqQkwgg ... Xmzva/Km7A==""

You must first decode the base64 string to a byte array:
decoded = base64.b64decode(publicKey) 

This function deserializes an array of bytes into a familiar Python protobuf object, I took it from this answer and modified a little:
def deserialize(byte_message, proto_type):
    module_, class_ = proto_type.rsplit('.', 1)
    class_ = getattr(crypto_pb2, class_) # crypto_pb2 is a name of module we recently created and imported
    rv = class_()
    rv.ParseFromString(byte_message) # use .SerializeToString() to reverse operation
    return rv

Further we call the function, pass the decoded base64 and the name of the class to which it corresponds (PublicKey for publicKey and PrivateKey for privateKey), I'm interested in the Data property.
publicKey = deserialize(decoded, 'crypto.pb.PublicKey').Data

Now you can transfer it to the import_key function as ByteArray. Do not perform additional conversions.
key = Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.import_key(publicKey)
crypter = Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEPPKCS1_OAEP.new(key)
encryptedData = crypter.encrypt(data.encode())
result = base64.b64encode(encryptedData).decode()

","You'll need to build pycrypto before you upload it. This will need to be done on a machine with as similar an environment to your server as possible.
To build, run python setup.py build from inside the pycrypto-2.1.0 directory. This will create build\lib.win32-2.6\Crypto (the name of the libxxx directory might be a little different).
FTP the Crypto folder to somewhere on your server's python path. Inside the Django project folder may or may not work. A safe bet is to put it right in your site-packages folder, if you have access to it.
I don't know much about deploying on Windows, but usually you need to restart the server to reload the application whenever you make any changes. Hopefully that's what you meant by 'code refresh'

When Google says the python version for app engine is '2.7' do they mean precisely 2.7.0? Or is python 2.7.1 okay too?

Any subversion of python 2.7 works. 2.7.0 works, but I have used 2.7.6 and 2.7.10 extensively as well. So I'm sure that 2.7.1 will work too.

Can this cause problems for my local install of pycrypto?

I know you have asked about this before but I will give you an other (better) way to include pycrypto in your appengine project.
In your app.yaml, specify the following:
libraries:
- name: pycrypto
  version: ""2.6""  # or ""latest"", or ""2.3""

See https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries27 for more info about which libraries are supported by appengine and how you can import which versions.

","It seems as though you're asking the question which inspired your title, about python verson 2.7.x, as a way to get insight into your actual problem, which is related to pycrypto. Tim's answer dealt with the question of which sub-versions of 2.7.x are supported.
It appears you're using both the app.yaml libraries stanza and pip to get an instance of pycrypto. So:
Is the pip-installed pycrypto residing on your dev-box somewhere like /usr/local/lib/python-2.7, or is it in the app's folder, specifically?
When the dev-server is running, is it possible your python path has it using the  pycrypto installed by pip on your system, with that pycrypto being a different version than the one in production? This might cause different behaviour on the dev-server vs. production.

...All this said, it still seems odd, as Tim has pointed out, that you should see a disruption to logging based on this. What is it you're logging, and are you using any exception handling which might be dropping the responsibility to log?
Finally, is there a setting when running the dev-server which you can use that would enable more verbosity? Try that to see if you can raise the logging level enough to make the exceptions you're looking for visible.
These are my thoughts so far on how to get out of your jam.

","You are getting correct output, but you appear to be confused by the repr() output for a bytes value.
Python gives you a value that can safely be copied and pasted back into a Python session. This aids debugging. This display uses ASCII printable text where possible to represent the value, but the value can be exactly reproduced with what is displayed.
Your expected value b'\x00\x7e\x15\x16\x28\xae\xd2\xa6\xab\xf7\x15\x88\x09\xcf\x4f\x3c' contains several ASCII characters that are printable, so Python shows those instead of the \xhh byte value:
>>> output = b'\x00\x7e\x15\x16\x28\xae\xd2\xa6\xab\xf7\x15\x88\x09\xcf\x4f\x3c'
>>> output 
b'\x00~\x15\x16(\xae\xd2\xa6\xab\xf7\x15\x88\t\xcfO<'
>>> output == b'\x00\x7e\x15\x16\x28\xae\xd2\xa6\xab\xf7\x15\x88\x09\xcf\x4f\x3c'
True

The bytestring is still 16 bytes long:
>>> len(output)
16

That ~ is ASCII codepoint 126, or 0x7E in hexadecimal:
>>> output[1]
126
>>> hex(output[1])
'0x7e'

The same applies to \x28 and (, \x09 and \t (the tab character escape sequence), \x4f and O, and \x3c and <.
The \xhh escape sequence is just notation in a bytes object literal to define a given byte value, but you can produce the exact same value with ~. Ditto for \t, you can express that same value as \x09, but Python prefers using the \t sequence when showing the representation.

","First, a few warnings:

Blowfish is not a secure cipher by today's standard. Use AES.
Counter mode (CTR) is not secure because it does not detect malicious modification of the encrypted data. Use other modes like GCM, CCM or EAX.
Counter mode really requires a random IV for every message. However, you are using a fixed IV fixed which is very wrong.

To answer your question, you should initialize the cipher as:
from Crypto.Util import Counter

ctr = Counter.new(64, initial_value=0, little_endian=True)
cipher = Blowfish.new(self.masterKey, Blowfish.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr)

The Counter object is documented here. It allows the definition of a little-endian counter (typically CTR is big-endian).
NOTE: blowfish.py encrypts differently in big-endian machines than on little-endian ones.

"18596577","Why is decryption failing after separate writes to this file-like object?","I'm working on a toy module to encrypt tempfiles.  The idea is to expose an interface similar to that found in the tempfile module, but to have data transparently encrypted using session keys.  Again, it's just a toy project and not production code.
First, a few technical details.  This project is implemented with pycrypto and is employing:

AES-CTR
A counter with a 1-bit randomized prefix

The basic class is structured so as to mimic the file object interface.  When a method such as read or write is called, we initialize a Crypto.Cipher.AES object using the class' _cipher property.  This property is implemented as follows:
def _cipher():
    doc = doc = ""Returns a stateful AES object ready to decrypt at the required \
                 stream position""

    def fget(self):
        ctr = Counter.new(nbits=64,
                          initial_value=self.tell()  # alias of self._file.tell
                          prefix=self._nonce)  # set by `Random.new().read(8)
        return AES.new(self._key, counter=ctr, mode=self._opmode)  # self._opmode = Crypto.Cipher.AES.MODE_CTR

    def fset(self, value):
        raise AttributeError('Cannot set _cipher')

    def fdel(self, value):
        raise AttributeError('Cannot delete _cipher')

    return locals()
        _cipher = property(**_cipher())

Here is an example of how the _cipher property is used to encrypt transparently during a call to the write method.
def write(self, data):
    if not isinstance(data, str):
        raise TypeError('Data must be str (or bytestring)')
    self._file.write(self._cipher.encrypt(data))

When decrypting, we apply the opposite transaction as such:
def read(self, size=-1):
    return self._cipher.decrypt(self._file.read(size))

This works when making single calls to write, but fails when multiple calls to write are chained.  For instance:
ep = EphemeralFile()  # the class in question
ep.write('Now is the winter of our discontent')
ep.seek(0)
print ep.read()

>> Now is the winter of our discontent

So far so good... but here's where it fails
ep.write(' made glorious summer by this sun of York')
ep.seek(0)
print ep.read()

>> Now is the winter of our discontent""d_""��U�L~ �w���S��h��]""U(��P^��9k

What am I doing wrong?  Shouldn't the use of self._file.tell() in the _cipher property yield the appropriate counter position for decryption?
Please note that I first suspected that I might be off by one counter tick, so I tried modifying the initial_value=self.tell() line to initial_value=self.tell() + 1 (also tried with -1), but to no avail.

","I believe one problem is that the Counter object should receive as initial_value the AES block number, not the byte offset. In other words, you need to have:
ctr = Counter.new(nbits=64,
                  initial_value=self.tell() % 16,
                  prefix=self._nonce)

That's needed because in AES CTR mode you increase the value each time you cross the AES data boundary (16 bytes).
That also means that the correct sequence for any write operation roughly is:

Start the cipher object as shown above - in encryption mode.
Encrypt self.tell() % 16 bytes of any data and throw away the result.
Encrypt the input data and write it to the file.

Similarly for reading:

Start the cipher object as shown above - in decryption mode.
Decrypt self.tell() % 16 bytes of any data and throw away the result.
Decrypt the data read from the file.

From a quick look at the code, a second problem could also be that you use the same AES object for both encryption and decryption. You need two separate objects, one for each direction.

I tried to encode a sample file and it raised this ValueError . Then I try to work with a file which contain only one char directly on the Python interpreter. Encryption worked well but decryption broke with the same error as above.
","The main problem with the code is the use of newline characters to separate the chunks of encrypted data.  The encrypted data may already contain newline characters, so attempting to split the encrypted data into lines may produce partial chunks, which will raise the ValueError that you see when decrypted.
A second problem is that the encrypted files are being opened in text mode.  When dealing with encrypted data open files in binary mode.  Encrypted bytes are unlikely to be decodable to str, so using text mode will result in encoding or decoding errors.
This version of your code works:
import functools

from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA 
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # Encrypt

    with open('public.pem', 'r') as fp: 
        pub = fp.read()
        fp.close()

    public = RSA.importKey(pub)

    # tockage du fichier dans une variable rep
    with open('test.csv', 'r') as fichier:
        rep = fichier.read()

    # liminations des spaces
    rep = rep.replace(' ', '') 

    # ncodage pour type bytes
    rep = rep.encode()

    cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(public)

    # decoupage en mot de 10 chars
    rep = [rep[i:i+10] for i in range(0, len(rep), 10)]

    # Open the file in binary mode so we can write bytes.
    with open('encrypted.csv', 'wb') as fichier2:
        for i in rep:
            fichier2.write(cipher.encrypt(i))

    # Decrypt
    with open('private.pem', 'r') as fk: 
        priv = fk.read()

    private = RSA.importKey(priv)

    CHUNK_SIZE = 256 
    # Open the file in binary mode so we can read bytes.
    with open('encrypted.csv', 'rb') as fichier:
        # Create an iterator that will return chunks of the correct size.
        chunker = iter(functools.partial(fichier.read, CHUNK_SIZE), b'')
        rep = list(chunker)

    cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(private)

    with open('decrypted.csv', 'w') as fichier2:
        for i in rep:
            decrypted_line = cipher.decrypt(i)
            fichier2.write(decrypted_line.decode())

Rather than splitting the encrypted data on newlines, this code reads from the file in chunks of 256 bytes, as the encryption process seems to generate 256 bytes for each chunk of input.  I'm not a cryptologist, so it's possible this isn't always true.  In that case it might be better to encrypt (or decrypt) all the data in a single step.

Which AES mode suits this use case best?

","It seems that you are trying to run a certain command on every file in a folder, including any files in (recursive) subfolders of that folder.
In that case, you want to use os.walk, which will recursively traverse the given directory and yield a tuple of the (current directory, directories, files).

The map function simply applies crypt (well, a wrapper around crypt) to each item.
map(lambda f: crypt(f, key, root), files) is functionally equivalent to:

","ACR4 is a stream cipher. It does not encrypt the way you think it does. Try this:
en(""abcd"" * 16)

and see what happens. The result will not be 16 times the same bytes but similar to what you tried in your question.
If you want to encrypt to the same bytes, you must use a new instance of ACR4:
e1 = ACR4.new('0123456789123456').encrypt
e2 = ACR4.new('0123456789123456').encrypt

assert e1(""abcd"") == e2(""abcd"")

","RC4 is a stream cipher, so the encrypted form of some plaintext depends on what the cipher has already encrypted.
>>> encrypted = [en('abcd') for i in range(4)]

Create new RC4 objects before doing the encryption/decryption and you'll get the result you expect:

TL;DR for the link: 
So I was asking about a Unicode error in python for my encryption program and someone told me to just encode the password in utf-8 and it worked.

Now I have a second problem, where it says that the IV isn't 16 bytes, so I checked this by putting print(len(IV)) after the IV and after running 3 tests it only returns 16 once, in the middle of the printed characters, and the end character is greater than 16 (eg: 37, 35, 28, etc.). 
How could I fix this so that the IV always returns 16 bytes?

And this is the source of the problem: you're assuming each character is one byte long, but that's not the case.
You can generate a random IV of N bytes with the following code:
import os

N = 16
IV = os.urandom(N)

Another issue in your code is that you're opening all your files in 'rb' mode, which stands for ""read binary"", but attempting to write to it instances of str, like your IV. That won't work because in this mode you're only allowed to read and write bytes, not str. In my solution for calculating the IV this issue completely disappears.

This is a continuation of this question. Please do not mark this question as a duplicate for it has a different error I need to fix.

TL;DR for the link: 
So I was asking about a Unicode error in python for my encryption program and someone told me to just encode the password in utf-8 and it worked.

Now I have a second problem, where it says that the IV isn't 16 bytes, so I checked this by putting print(len(IV)) after the IV and after running 3 tests it only returns 16 once, in the middle of the printed characters, and the end character is greater than 16 (eg: 37, 35, 28, etc.). 
How could I fix this so that the IV always returns 16 bytes?

","You have not converted your IV string to a byte string. In Python 3 str is not a byte string, but a character string. str is abstracted away from the concept of how characters are represented as bytes.
You'll need to convert your IV variable (and perhaps others, I haven't checked) to be instances of bytes. It's also a bit easier to make your bytestring in Python 3.
random_byte_list = [random.randrange(256) for _ in range(16)]
IV = bytes(random_byte_list)

However, when I run my job I get the following error:

So clearly, it's not being able to read the Crypto module.

I followed this:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-python-libraries.html
And this:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-job-python.html#create-python-egg-library
And added the setup.py file with the contents:
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name=""Crypto"",
    version=""0.1"",
    packages=['Crypto']

And compressed the contents of the Crypto directory + the setup.py file into the zip file pycrypto.zip which I uploaded into S3 and referenced in my Glue job's Python library path.

After all of this, I still get the error.
I have run my script using the following combinations with no results:
from Crypto.Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Cipher import AES

What is the correct way to use this compiled module in AWS Glue? I find it frustrating as the compatible python libraries are very limited and there's not lots of examples, documentation or community posts to explain how to achieve this yet. 
","Found this question
AWS Glue Python
Which suggested using this:
import os

from setuptools.command import easy_install
install_path = os.environ['GLUE_INSTALLATION']
easy_install.main( [""--install-dir"", install_path, ""<library-name>""] )
reload(site)


import <installed library>

So I took the latest version from https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/#files
import os
import site
from setuptools.command import easy_install
install_path = os.environ['GLUE_INSTALLATION']

easy_install.main( [""--install-dir"", install_path, ""https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/60/db/645aa9af249f059cc3a368b118de33889219e0362141e75d4eaf6f80f163/pycrypto-2.6.1.tar.gz""] )
reload(site)

And it's working!
Still, I would like to know how to use it as a referenced python library.

I have so far implemented the SSH_AGENTC_REQUEST_IDENTITIES and SSH_AGENT_IDENTITIES_ANSWER correctly which causes SSH to then send the SSH_AGENTC_SIGN_REQUEST as per https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-miller-ssh-agent-00.html
The issue I have is figuring out how to sign the request, at this point I only need to support ssh-rsa. I have attemped to implement this as per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253 but I can't seem to generate a reply that will authenticate.
From what I understand of this specification the entire data section of the SSH_AGENTC_SIGN_REQUEST message needs to be signed using RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5
Here is the code that receives the request
if msgType == SSH_AGENTC_SIGN_REQUEST:
  blobLen = struct.unpack('!I', sock.recv(4))[0]
  blob    = sock.recv(blobLen)
  dataLen = struct.unpack('!I', sock.recv(4))[0]
  data    = sock.recv(dataLen)

  buff.extend(struct.pack('!B', SSH_AGENT_SIGN_RESPONSE))

  packBytes(buff, signed)
  head = struct.pack('!I', len(buff))

  sock.sendall(head);
  sock.sendall(buff);

Here is the source of rpc.root.signSSHData:
  def exposed_signSSHData(self, server_id, data):
    query = ""SELECT private_key FROM servers WHERE deleted = 0 AND id = %s LIMIT 1""
    cursor = self.core.getDBC().cursor()
    cursor.execute(query, (server_id, ))

    signer = PKCS1_v1_5.new(key)

Update 1: I believe I may have figured it out, seems that the data is a SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST as defined in RFC4252. I will update my application and see how it goes.

Now I know the HSM (relatively low-end model) does work:
> sudo /opt/nfast/bin/generatekey embed name=PRIVKEYNAME cardset=Keymanager
# answer a few questions
# private key saved in /tmp/KEY

> sudo openssl rsa -in /tmp/KEY -pubout > /tmp/KEY.pub
# generates the public key

> sudo cat /tmp/clear.txt | openssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin -inkey veeip2.pub > /tmp/encrypted.txt
# ""clear.txt"" contains ""foo""
# ""encrypted.txt"" is always 256 bytes long, which is correct.

> sudo /opt/nfast/bin/preload /usr/bin/openssl rsautl -engine chil -decrypt -inkey /tmp/KEY -in /tmp/encrypted.txt
# engine ""chil"" set.
# ""foo""

There seems to be a loss (or an addition??) somewhere between the client and the server, related to padding. But for the life of me, I have no idea what it could be.
I suspect the way the encryption is done client-side could be the culprit, as when done locally, everything works flawlessly.

 - I have installed a custom version of python on my shared server. Its just Python 2.7 with Pycrypto and easy_install installed.
- I am certain that the script is running under Python 2.7 and not Dreamhosts default 2.6 version. I know this because the script prints sys.version_info(major=2, minor=7, micro=0, releaselevel='final', serial=0) both in the UNIX shell and HTTP.
- I installed Pycrypto manually (using tar, and running setup.py) as opposed to using easy_install or pip.
- I have editted my .bash_profile's PATH variable correctly (well I believe I have done it correctly because the script is run under Python 2.7 not 2.6).

Thank you for your time. 
","When encrypting, the salt is stored as bytes literal in the csv-file. When decrypting, the salt is interpreted as a string literal, which factually means that a different salt and thus a different key is used. The wrong decryption also leads to an invalid padding, which results in the error message Padding is incorrect. 
The different salts during encryption and decryption can be easily checked with the debugger by comparing the value and type of key_salt_pair[1] in encrypt_cols and (the corresponding) encrypted_dict['salt'][index] in decrypt_cols.

    if salt == None:
        saltBin = os.urandom(16)
        salt = saltBin.hex()
    else:                             
        saltBin = bytes.fromhex(salt)    

    kdf = PBKDF2(password, saltBin, 64, 100000)
    key = kdf[:32]

    return [key,salt]

Alternatively, the change can also be made in encrypt_cols and decrypt_cols.
Another point is: In the current code, the csv-files still have the DataFrame-column. This can be removed by setting the index-parameter in pandas#DataFrame#to_csv to False, here.

I have completed the backend python code which will import modules from OpenSSL.Crypto library.. 
How to execute the same in client side?.. i.e signing operation should be done in client side, 
In google i found like Brython, skulpt, pyjams help in this.. But i m confused to start.. Any suggestions?
","So, first things first: it is not usueal to have the same code to run on server side and client side.
Second thing: be aware that no authentication (or ""signing"") done on client side can be regarded as safe. At most, the client side can take care of closely coupling the signing with the UI to give the user dynamic feedback - but since whatever requests the client side send to the server can very easily be impersonated by an script, authentication must be performed server side for each request -  for example, a variable saying the current user has authenticated correctly can just be sent as ""True"", regardless of usernames and passwords actually known.
Third thing: despite all this, since there are these frameworks for using Python or a Python like language client side, it is indeed possible to have some modules in  a code base that are used both client side and server side. Of those, I am most familiar with Brython which has achieved a nice level of Python 3.x compatibility and I indeed have a project sharing code client side and server side.   
The re-used code would have to be refactored to abstract any I/O (like getting user input, or getting values from a database), of couse, since these are fundamentally different things on server side, and client side. Still, some core logic can be in place that is reused both sides. 
However third party python modules, like Pycrypto won't work client side (you could probably code a xmlrpc/jsonrpc like call to use it server side) -
and although Python's hashlib is not implemented now in Brython, the project has got a momentum that opening a feature request for at least the same codecs that exist in javascript could be fulfilled in a matter of days. 
(bugs/features requests can be open at github.com/brython-dev/brython)
(PS. I just found out, to my dismay, that currently there is no standard way to compute any hash, not even md5, in Javascript without third party modules - that just emphasize the utilities of frameworks like Brython or coffescript which can bring up a bundle of functionality in a clean way)

In the future, I may have to get more data from where it is currently stored and add it to a database.  I want the encryption to be so such that if I add an existing subject to the database, all the plain text of the encrypted identification numbers are the same.
For instance, if I wanted to encrypt 123456789, then the resulting plain text of the encrypted data should be the same no matter which machine I use to encrypt the data.  Likewise, if any of my collaborators have to implement similar encryption in a different language (say Java for instance), their future encrypted plain text should match encrypted plain text from the past.
I know AES in ECB mode is a deterministic encryption scheme and perhaps may not be best for long messages, but since these are so short, and I need total control of the encryption, I thought it may be appropriate.
How can I implement something like I have described using pycrypto?  Is ECB mode the appropriate mode?

I downloaded and installed ActiveState's Python 2.7.10.12, 64 bit, without issue. The interactive shell appears to work fine.
Next, I went to VoidSpace and downloaded PyCrypto 2.6 for Python 2.7 64bit (pycrypto-2.6.win-amd64-py2.7.exe). I ran it and accepted the default folders and clicked “Next” twice, after which it crashed with the following message from Windows:
pycrypto-2.6.win-amd64-py2.7.exe has stopped working 

and no other information.
I downloaded the file again and rebooted the computer and got the same result several times.
How can I figure out why it won’t install and what to do about it?
","Okay, I did some more digging and found the problem, which is:
The installation file has to be ""Run as administrator.""

In other words, right click the file name and select ""Run as administrator.""
It's as simple as that.
Here's what I did to figure that out:
Looking at the StackOverflow post, How do I install PyCrypto on Windows?, I noticed some suggestions to run the installation file using easy_install, so I tried that. (easy_install is in the Python27\Scripts folder.) That gave me a long error message, which said something about signing in as an administrator. I am the administrator, but this gave me the idea that maybe the file wants to run as an administrator. So I tried that and Voila! The installation proceeded to completion.
I don’t know if there’s a reason that I had to do that and other people don’t have to. I've sent an e-mail to Michael at VoidSpace suggesting that he add a note near the download links suggesting that it be run that way.

I am trying to alter the cipher text by a bit (or more) to see the effect it would have on my plaintext when decrypting.
For example:
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import base64
import os

BLOCK_SIZE = 16
key = os.urandom(BLOCK_SIZE)

PADDING = '{'
pad = lambda s: s + (BLOCK_SIZE - len(s) % BLOCK_SIZE) * PADDING

print 'Decrypted string:', decoded

So I want to decrypt again except having modified the cipher text (""encoded"") before decrypting.
Thanks.
","The easiest way I can think of introducing some noise to the encoded string is to alter every nth character in it. You can play around with string manipulation to introduce more or less random noise (make the nth a random character, change it on every iteration, etc).
Add this function and imports somewhere before your code:
import string
import random

def noise_every_n(input, n, first=0):
    output = """"
    for i, c in enumerate(input, -first):
        if i % n == 0: # using ascii_letters and digits is just what came to mind, there's other ways to get random characters.
            output += random.choice(string.ascii_letters + string.digits)
        else:
            output += c
    return output

Then call the following between encode and decode:
every_n = random.randint(3, 5) # or just set it to a small integer
encoded = noise_every_n(encoded, every_n) 

The function above was adapted from this Stack Overflow answer.

Its possible to slice this list into two lists, one with price and another with amount?
or put this into a nested dict key, for me to use later?
Instead of returning a list it will assign the two values of each index on the list to a nested dict

"48631472","Key Kollision in DES3 Implementation of PyCrypto","I'm pretty new to cryptography and only a user really. I stumbled however over a very interesting ""vulnerability"" of the DES3 Cipher of the PyCrypto library. 
I experimented with generating Private Keys and encrypting them with DES3. Everything is fine with the following code:
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import DES3
from Crypto import Random

random_generator = Random.new().read
key = RSA.generate(1024,random_generator)
public_key = key.publickey()
enc_data = public_key.encrypt('abcdefgh', 32)

exported_key = key.exportKey('PEM', '12345678abcdefgh', pkcs=1)
print(exported_key)
imported_key = RSA.importKey(exported_key,'12345678abcdefgi')

print(imported_key.exportKey('PEM'))

Note the minor change in the passphrase when importing the key. As expected, the result of the import is a fail, as the Private Key can not be decrypted correctly with the 16 byte passphrase provided. When I change the passphrase to the correct one, everything is fine.
However, when I experimented with encrypting something with DES3 (the standard encryption used in passphrase encrypting in this code), I stumbled accross something.
Regard the code:
from Crypto.Cipher import DES3

des = DES3.new(""12345678abcdefgh"")
secret = des.encrypt(""1234abcd"")
print(secret)

des2 = DES3.new(""12345678abcdefgi"")
result = des2.decrypt(secret)
print(result)

Which produces the following result:
��@e���
1234abcd

I can decode the message despite having an unauthorized key. For every other change I have tried so far (""12345678absdefgj"" e.g.), encryption works as expected.
Is this a vulnerability in the DES3 cipher, an incorrect implementation or a fault in my ""experiment""?
Thanks for your help!

"31661748","Passing encrypted data between Python Gae and Client","I am trying to learn how to pass encrypted data between server (Python gae) and client(jquery)
The following sketch of a code fragment at the server works:
random_generator = Random.new().read
key = RSA.generate(1024,random_generator)

publicKey        =  key.publickey()
clearText        =  ""this is a test message""

b64DecryptedText =  key.decrypt(encryptedText)  
clearText        =  base64.b64decode(b64DecryptedText)


I do not understand what to pass to the client as a public key which the client can use to encrypt
(using http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/aes.js)
","1. Sending public key to the client
The client only needs the public key to encrypt something that the server can then decrypt. An RSA public key is made up of the modulus n and the public exponent e. The easy way would be to send both parts as hex-encoded strings.
modulus = hex(key.publickey().n)[2:-1]
exponent = hex(key.publickey().e)[2:-1]

2. Using public key to encrypt
CryptoJS doesn't provide an RSA implementation, but jsbn (GitHub) does. It's a good thing that we sent the public components as hex, because jsbn expects the modulus and public exponent as hex-encoded strings:
var rsa = new RSA();
rsa.setPublic(n_string, e_string);
var res = rsa.encrypt(plaintext);

Keep in mind that RSA can only encrypt data that is not bigger as the modulus. If you generate 1024-bit keys, then you can't encrypt data bigger than 1024-bit. If you want to encrypt bigger data, you need Hybrid Encryption with for example AES.
jsbn also only uses PKCS#1 v1.5 padding which pycrypto supports. You can try the non-yet merged pull request #3 to get PKCS#1 v2 OAEP which is more secure than v1.5 padding.
3. Decryption in python
jsbn returns a hex-encoded ciphertext. You can safely send it as you wish, but you need to decode (not shown) it to bytes before decryption in python.
sentinel = Random.new().read(32) # denotes the error result of the decryption 
cipher = PKCS1_v1_5.new(key) # private key
message = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext, sentinel)
if sentinel != message:
    print(""success: "" + str(message))
else:
    print(""failure"")

"53972400","Why doesn't PyCrypto allow for encoding with the private and decoding with the public key to verify the sendersidentity","I've been playing around with the PyCrypto Library with the intention to make a system that works like this:

Create a RSA keyset for both the sender and the receiver and a seperate AES key
The sender:


Encrypts the message with the AES key using the ECB encryption mode ECB
Encrypts the AES key with the senders private key
Concats their own name to the result of the last step
Encrypts the result from the last step with the receivers public key
Combines the results from step 1 and 4 into 1 message and sends it to the receiver

And the receiver


Splits the message into the actual message and the double encrypted key (which also contains the senders name)
Decrypts the double encrypted key using their own private key
Uses the name of the sender to retrieve the senders public key
Decrypts the AES key with the senders public key
Decrypts the message with the AES key


But I'm having trouble with the double encryption. The problem is that I can't decrypt something with the public key when it is encrypted with the private key. I understand that it is because ARS isn't supposed to work backwards, but I want to do this to verify the senders identity to the receiver. I don't know how else to do this.

Clearly they are very close, but node seems to be padding the output with some extra bytes. Any ideas how I can get the two to interoperate?
","First, in a secure crypto system, you should expect the output to be different every time you encrypt, even using the same code. That fact that yours doesn't indicates it's an insecure cipher. Typically this is done by adding a random IV.
Your IV is ""11869021012"", which is horrible (because it's not random, and not even 16 bytes), but it does seem you're using it the same way in both, so that's fine.
Your password is the SHA-256 of a string, which is a horrible way to create a key, but still, you seem to be doing it the same way in both cases, so that's fine.
Your problem is that the Python code emits the IV followed by the cipher text. Your JS code does not emit the IV; it only emits the cipher text. So you probably meant this in the Python:
return base64.b64encode(cipher.encrypt(cleartext))

Or you need to rework the JavaScript to glue together the IV and the cipher text before Base64 encoding.

The problem I have is:
import logging

logging.info(""test"") # this works before importing crypto

import Crypto

logging.info(""test2"") # this one does not after importing crypto

How does crypto change logging and how can I fix it so that I can use logging normally again in my python app?
Update1:
It seems that some python errors are also not displayed in the logging from app engine, as well as correct python code also giving a '500 internal server error' which is only visible in a browser console when testing the app in localhost.
Update2:
I have completely disabled any imports of Python Crypto ( which is provide by Google App Engine ), and now my logging works correctly, displaying all my own testing logging lines and python errors. This of course does not solve the problem as I need the Crypto module. Using Crypto in this case blocks the ability to test any code because you can not see errors in the logging.
Update3: 
To be clear, I have included the crypto library in app.yaml exactly as instructed by Google App Engine docs. The crypto library itself works fine, the problem is that it breaks logging in my python app engine app.

","You don't use private keys to encrypt data.

A private key can sign data, which can be verified by the matching public key.
A public key can encrypt data, which can be decrypted by the matching private key.

If what you really want is to sign your hash, instead of using the encrypt function, you should use the sign function.
So, instead of
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_v1_5
PKCS1_v1_5.new(privateKey).encrypt(hash)

you might want to try

the results for both the cases is different but after decryption they both tend to give the same correct result.
what might be the issue here?
","You didn't specify what different results are you getting but those two should produce same-ish result. The only difference I see is in the base64 alphabet you're using.
In Python you're calling base64.urlsafe_b64encode() which differs from the standard Base64 in what characters it uses for values for 62 and 63 (- and _ instead of + and /). To get the same result, either in Python return:
return base64.b64encode(encrypted)

Or post-process the base64 encoded string in Node.js:
encoded = encoded.replace(/_/g, '/').replace(/-/g, '+');

All this being said, as I've mentioned in my comment, never derive an IV from your password/key (or anything else deterministic and unchanging). Use a cryptographically secure PRNG for it.

I am using pycryptodome  instead of Pycrypto because i cant install Pycrypto in my pc.
I did some researches how to fix this. There is the link that said the error is caused by conflict between python-crypto in lib and local/lib ... But i dont think it is. Here is the link https://github.com/nccgroup/Winpayloads/issues/21

counter : (object) – Instance of Crypto.Util.Counter, which allows full customization of the counter block. This parameter is incompatible to both nonce and initial_value.

counter in this context is an anonymous function (a lambda), but not an instance of Crypto.Util.Counter.  Given key_128 = os.urandom(16) - key_128 is a string.

","A fundamental component of RSA encryption is padding. Pycrypto used to expose  the raw decrypt and encrypt methods for an RSA key object (the ones you use), but that is wrong and insecure, because they don't implement any padding.
Instead, you should use the module Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEP (the only option in pycryptodome), which securely takes care of the padding.

","This isn't the question you asked, but please be aware there is a significant cryptographic weakness in your EncryptText. You split up your messages into chunks and encrypt each one. This method is roughly the same as symmetric encryptions's ECB mode, and so it shares the same weakness:
a) An attacker is able to reorder the chunks of a message, or swap them between different encryptions.
b) Chunks that are repeated are visible, giving the attacker clues as to how to decrypt the message.

","Although you cannot find a unique mapping from a hashing and the data it was generated to, you can still maintain a database describing mappings between certain data and their hash.
By doing a reverse research on the hash, you can find instances of data that would produce the particular hash you are looking for (if you get a match in your database).
Of course the database could have no match or contain multiple matches of the hash, because of the mathematical definition of a hash as being unilateral.
That is exactly how sites such as the one you provided work.
It is also the same mechanism used in hash tables.

","Cryptographic hash functions like SHA2, SHA3, Shake, Blake2, etc. are all one-way functions. They can hash arbitrary length inputs to a fixed size like 256 in SHA-256. Due to the pigeon principle, there are collisions and they are inevitable. But we expect to find if hard. We expect them to have;

preimage-resistance — for essentially all pre-specified outputs, it is computationally infeasible to find any input which hashes to that output, i.e., to find any preimage x' such that h(x') = y when given any y for which a corresponding input is not known.
2nd-preimage resistance, weak-collision — it is computationally infeasible to find any second input which has the same output as any specified input, i.e., given x, to find a 2nd-preimage x' != x such that h(x) = h(x').
collision resistance, strong-collision — it is computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs x, x' which hash to the same output, i.e., such that h(x) = h(x').

In your case, it is the pre-image attack. Generic pre-image attacks on cryptographic hash functions have O(2^x)-time complexity where x is the output length of the hash function. In SHA-256 O(2^256)
The web site you have mentioned has a trick, then you want to SHA256 hash some text, they immediately store it on their database. When you asked about the hash value that you got from their site, they search for it on their database. It exists since they store it when you asked the hash value. So, you helped them to increase the hashes of their DB. They only have 6,128,202,407 sha256 hash database which is a tiny amount compared to possible outputs od SHA-256 that is 2^256
Side note: hashing is not encryption.

I have also found some ideas in stackoverflow. but can't able to understand very well.
","The way you have configured this cipher is highly insecure. DO NOT USE THIS CODE.
By setting:
counter = lambda : iv

while initializing the AES cipher in Python, you have forced AES-CTR to use the exact same counter for every block. This reduces the cipher from AES-CTR to a simple rolling XOR. Observe:
>>> key = ""abcd1234abcd1234""
>>> iv = '\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0'
>>> encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter = lambda : iv)
>>> encryptor.encrypt(""example block 01"")
'\xda\x7f\x00\xbdp\x1c\xe4\xf3=|\x88\xe2\xe5%\x80\xab'
>>> encryptor.encrypt(""example block 01"")
'\xda\x7f\x00\xbdp\x1c\xe4\xf3=|\x88\xe2\xe5%\x80\xab'
>>> encryptor.encrypt(""example block 02"")
'\xda\x7f\x00\xbdp\x1c\xe4\xf3=|\x88\xe2\xe5%\x80\xa8'

Notice that:

Encrypting the same block repeatedly results in the same output.
Encrypting similar blocks results in similar output. (Technically, a XOR b = E(a) XOR E(b).)

To fix this, you need to use the Counter class you have already imported:
encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=Counter.new(128))

Once you have configured AES-CTR correctly, your existing Java code should be able to decrypt it.
However, note that this mode is still insecure if the same key is reused to encrypt multiple files. You must use a different key for every file.

I tried on 16 MB file: 
Encryption time = 3.31 secs
  Decryption time = 0.18 secs

Can someone help me in telling what could be the reason for this?
Encryption Logic Looks like below:
def encrypt_file(key, infile, chunksize=64 * 1024):
    """""" Encrypts a file using AES (CBC mode) with the
        given key.

        key:
            The encryption key - a string that must be
            either 16, 24 or 32 bytes long. Longer keys
            are more secure.

        infile:
            input file

        chunksize:
            Sets the size of the chunk which the function
            uses to read and encrypt the file. Larger chunk
            sizes can be faster for some files and machines.
            chunksize must be divisible by 16.
    """"""
    iv = os.urandom(16)
    encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    infile.seek(0, os.SEEK_END)
    filesize = infile.tell()
    infile.seek(0, os.SEEK_SET)

    encrypted = b'';
    encrypted += struct.pack('<Q', filesize)
    encrypted += iv

    while True:
        chunk = infile.read(chunksize)
        if len(chunk) == 0:
            break
        elif len(chunk) % 16 != 0:
            chunk += b' ' * (16 - len(chunk) % 16)
        encrypted += encryptor.encrypt(chunk)

    return encrypted

And Decryption logic looks like below:
def decrypt_file(key, infile, out_filename, chunksize=24*1024):

"26716464","pycrypto with multiple users in virtual environment","I'm using Paramiko (which depends on PyCrypto) on Windows in a virtual environment.  
Because I'm on Windows, I don't have a C compiler by default, so I got the windows executable from XXX, and installed it using:
workon myenv
easy_install pycrypto-2.6.win32-py2.7.exe
python myscript.py

And everything worked for me.
Now my colleague (Steve) would like to use the same program, so he does:
workon myenv
python myscript.py

and it fails with ""ImportError: no module named Crypto"".  Which is odd.  What is odder is that if Steve easy_installs the PyCrypto module, he can use it, but I can't.  The library only seems to work for the person who installed it.
Any idea what I'm missing?  
","You're using virtualenvwrapper, which creates virtualenv directory in .virtualenvs inside users' home directory by default. ([WORKON_HOME][1])
Users' home directories are not shared. So other user cannot use your virtualenv.
Make a virtualenv in a directory that your friend can access.
virtualenv /some/shared/virtualenv-dir

And let other user activate it:
/some/shared/virtualenv-dir/activate


If you want to use virtualenvwrapper, you and other users need to set WORKON_HOME environmental variable to a shared directory. (Not sure this also apply for win32 version of virtualenvwrapper you're using)

For security reasons, I want to encrypt the YAML file so that nobody form outside (internet) or inside (my roommates) can read the file and steal the login information without permission. So far, I've come up with a script that uses PyCrypto for AES encryption and decryption.
I don't get how to securely hide the key (used to encrypt and decrypt) the YAML config. Can somebody recommend a good strategy?
The script needs to have access each time it is scheduled to run, in order to get the login information. Providing the key manually is thus not very handy.

This is the decryption code with JS:
var crypto_test = require('crypto-js'); 
var bytes = crypto_test.AES.decrypt(encrypted_text, 'test_key');

This is the equivalent Python version that Im trying to create:
BS = 32
key = 'test_key'
dkey = hashlib.sha256(key.encode()).digest()
encodedEncrypted = base64.b64decode(encrypted_text)
#block_size is 16

def _unpad(s):
    return s[:-ord(s[len(s)-1:])]

From the documentation of CryptoJS I found:

If a passphrase has been used instead of a key then It will use AES
256 by default. 
The mode is CBC.
The padding is PKCS7.

However Pycrypto by default is forcing me to use a 16 bytes IV not a 32 as the documentation from CryptoJS proposed..so Im a bit confused on the correct way to do the decryption here.. Also I saw in some documentation that CryptoJS applies to sha256 to passphrase..but still not sure about that ..
That code will not crash but will give an empty text..

The above driver program loops forever. The problem is that (regardless of the number and/or value of the fields) the hash ALWAYS starts with 0b1, which messes with the whole idea of mining difficulty and proof-of-work. More importantly, though, this is not the expected behavior of a hashing function. What do I miss?
","Python doesn't zero pad the front of binary numbers by default, so the first digit of any binary number will be one.

Otherwise, just use a binary and (&) to check if the specific bit is set.

"54432183","Mix net implementation with RSA in python","I'm trying to implement Mixnet in Python. Consider the example in the linked wiki page — A encrypts a message with A's public key and then encrypts the resulting ciphertext along with B's address with M's public key.
When I run my code which attempts to do the above, I get ValueError: Plaintext is too long. that's because I'm not appending the address B the right way and I'm exceeding the 1024 size of RSA. How do I accomplish this with RSA?
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP
from Crypto import Random

def create_rsa():
    random_generator = Random.new().read
    key = RSA.generate(1024, random_generator) #generate pub and priv key

tl;dr How do I do  with RSA?

I am trying to save a generated RSA key pair (2048 bit) to a file on disk.
I can generate the key pair by calling:
def generate_key_pair():
    """"""Generates a 2048 bit RSA key pair""""""
    return RSA.generate(2048)

to save them to disk in the ""required"" format is where I am having issues.  The java program does it with this statement:
RSAIO.save(rsaDirectory, keyPair);

What is the equivalent Python statement (I am using the pycrypto module)?  (If possible, please limit the answers to for cryptography to pycrypto and standard python library modules...)
Is there a sort of cheat sheet of equivalenent modules/methods between Java and Python?

"50412705","How to reduce the length of a message encrypted with Hybrid encryption","I was looking for a good encryption scheme to encrypt my message and i founded that the Hybrid encryption is good for large and small messages. but i have a problem with the length of the output cipher message which is large.

if the input was ""hello"", then the length of the output message will be 586, and twice if if the message larger

here is the Encrypt function that i use:
def encrypt(username, msg):
    #get the reciever's public key
    f = open(""{}.pem"".format(username)) # a.salama.pem
    recipient_key = RSA.import_key(f.read())
    f.close()

    # Encrypt the session key with the reciever's public RSA key
    cipher_rsa = PKCS1_OAEP.new(recipient_key)

    # Encrypt the data with the AES128 session key
    session_key = get_random_bytes(16)  
    cipher_aes = AES.new(session_key, AES.MODE_EAX)
    ciphertext, tag = cipher_aes.encrypt_and_digest(msg)

    #finishing your processing
    encrypted_data = cipher_rsa.encrypt(session_key) + cipher_aes.nonce + tag +  ciphertext 
    encrypted_data = hexlify(encrypted_data).decode(""utf-8"")
    return encrypted_data

","There's a fixed number of extra bytes in the header regardless of the amount of plaintext being encrypted. That's evident from your line of code
encrypted_data = cipher_rsa.encrypt(session_key) + cipher_aes.nonce + tag +  ciphertext 

This extra data will be dominated by the RSA-encrypted session key. A more space-efficient choice would be ECIES using a well-known 256-bit elliptic curve.
However, you also have expansion of the data due to encoding. Your choice of encoding is hex encoding which doubles the amount of data. A more efficient and well-supported encoding is base64 encoding. Base64 encoding expands the data by a factor of 4/3. The most space-efficient is avoid encoding altogether and just store and transmit raw bytes. You only need to encode the data if it will transit over channel that cannot handle binary data.

Encrypted with this python function encrypt_tuple
from Crypto import Random
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

def encrypt_tuple(tupla, key):
    iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    return base64.b64encode(iv + cipher.encrypt(pad(str(tupla))))

def pad(s):
    return s + ((16 - len(s) % 16) * '*')

I have also the decrypt function written in python:
def decrypt_tuple(ciphertext, key):
    """"""Decifratura simmetrica della tupla in modalità CBC con AES""""""
    text = base64.b64decode(ciphertext)
    iv = text[:16]
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    dec = cipher.decrypt(text[16:]).decode('utf-8')
    return dec

And it works fine, but I need to decrypt this ciphertext with nodejs.
The encryption key is this:
key = b'\x13\xe3`X\x06J\x0b\x04\xeb\xc4\x82\xbdV\\\x83\xb7'

I tried everything but I cannot make it work.
I followed this example but nothing...
var crypto = require('crypto');

password = 'abcabcabc1abcabcabc1abcabcabc132';
var cryptoStr = 'Q336OpFur65nt1NgGUebbgx5hmwpcH3iUEd4mXq8qVwXL91qpLSaFecgKpsVvQEiT0DOMwK3TpUksPnjbr3wKA==';

var buf = new Buffer(cryptoStr, 'base64');
var iv = buf.toString('binary', 0, 16);
var crypt = buf.toString('base64', 16);

var decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv('aes-256-cbc', password, iv);
decipher.setAutoPadding(false);
var dec = decipher.update(crypt,'base64','utf-8');
dec += decipher.final('utf-8'); 

console.log('Decrypted content: ' + dec);

EDIT
My nodejs decrypt function is this:
var buf = new Buffer(data, 'base64');
var keyBuff = new Buffer('\x13\xe3`X\x06J\x0b\x04\xeb\xc4\x82\xbdV\\\x83\xb7');
var iv = buf.toString('binary', 0, 16);
var crypt = buf.toString('base64', 16);
var decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv('aes-128-cbc', keyBuff, iv);
decipher.setAutoPadding(false);
var dec = decipher.update(crypt,'base64','utf-8');
dec += decipher.final('utf-8'); 

But it does not work... it throws this error: 
Invalid IV length

","Here what I did to solve the problem:
I took the key:
key = b'\x13\xe3`X\x06J\x0b\x04\xeb\xc4\x82\xbdV\\\x83\xb7'

And on the python shell I converted it to base64 with this command:
base64.b64encode(b'\x13\xe3`X\x06J\x0b\x04\xeb\xc4\x82\xbdV\\\x83\xb7')

The result was this:
b'E+NgWAZKCwTrxIK9VlyDtw=='

Then I copied this string without the first character ('b') and I pasted it inside my nodeJs script replacing the old key.
I also changed the code of the decrypt function, this is the new one:
function decypherData(data){
    var buf = new Buffer(data, 'base64');
    var key = new Buffer('E+NgWAZKCwTrxIK9VlyDtw==', 'base64');
    var iv = buf.slice(0, 16);
    var crypt = buf.slice(16);
    var decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv('aes-128-cbc', key, iv);
    decipher.setAutoPadding(false);
    var dec = decipher.update(crypt,'base64','utf-8');
    dec += decipher.final('utf-8'); 
    return dec;
}

","Answer can be found at https://github.com/kivy/kivy-ios/issues/384
Pycrypto can be built but it won't run properly. The workaround is to avoid firebase (which requires pycrypto) altogether. Use requests and json instead for simple get and post methods.

when running make docker-build 
(after placing pycrypto==2.6.1 at requirements.txt file).
There's this thread and someone said about the same problem:
 
""The gcc compiler is not in your $PATH. It means either you dont have gcc installed or it's not in your $PATH variable"".
So tried placing apt-get install build-essential at Dockerfile, but I got
/bin/sh: apt-get: command not found
Then, I tried with yum install gcc
only to get
The command '/bin/sh -c yum install gcc' returned a non-zero code: 1
Docker-lambda [info page] (https://hub.docker.com/r/lambci/lambda/) says:
This project consists of a set of Docker images for each of the supported Lambda runtimes.

There are also a set of build images that include packages like gcc-c++, git, zip and the aws-cli for compiling and deploying.

So I guess I shouldn't be needing to install gcc. Maybe the gcc compiler is not in $PATH, but I don't know what to do to fix that.
Here is the dockerfile

WORKDIR $APP_DIR

COPY requirements.txt .
COPY bin ./bin
COPY lib ./lib

RUN mkdir -p $APP_DIR/lib
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt -t /var/task/lib

Any help on solving this?
","Well, well, well...today was a lucky day for me.
So simple: all I had to do was replace 
pycrypto==2.6.1 
by 
pycryptodome
on my requirements.txt file.
This thread says: ""Highly recommend NOT to use pycrypto. It is old and not maintained and contains many vulnerabilities. Use pycryptodome instead - it is compatible and up to date"".
And that's it! Docker builds just fine with pycryptodome.

I am wanting to verify a a file using Public Key crypto and I cant figure out why I'm getting a Type error for the below code, note signatureLength = 512
signature = f[:signatureLength]
f = open('lib/publicKey.pem','rb')
publicKey = RSA.importKey(f.read())
hash = SHA512.new(f[signatureLength:])
verification = PKCS1_PSS.new(publicKey)

The specific error is:
  File ""C:\Users\Zach Newton\Desktop\pp\lib\files.py"", line 77, in verify_file
    hash = SHA512.new(f[signatureLength:])
TypeError: '_io.BufferedReader' object is not subscriptable

","You're reassigning the name f:
signature = f[:signatureLength]
f = open('lib/publicKey.pem','rb')
publicKey = RSA.importKey(f.read())
hash = SHA512.new(f[signatureLength:]) # <-- this isn't the same f anymore
verification = PKCS1_PSS.new(publicKey)

You should use something like this instead:
signature = f[:signatureLength]
with open('lib/publicKey.pem','rb') as pubkeyfile:
    publicKey = RSA.importKey(pubkeyfile.read())
hash = SHA512.new(signature)
verification = PKCS1_PSS.new(publicKey)

For that reason using generic variable names like f and reusing names for something completely different is discouraged.

"56733079","Encrypt data with accents using python crypto library","I am implementing DES3 in Python using Crypto library. I was doing some test when I’ve stumbled upon the next problem: 
If the plain text that I want to encrypt contains strange charactes, as accents, fails. 
For example, my code is working fine when I try to encrypt the next word: 
Text to be encrypted(multiple of 8 in length) : ""Hello Jose      ""
However, it fails if I try to encrypt the same text but containing an accent:
Text to be encrypted (multiple of 8 in length)= ""Hello José      ""
The error that I am getting is “ValueError: Input strings must be a multiple of 8 in length”.
If I check the length of the word, it is a multiple of 8. 
plaintext=""Hello Jose      ""
print("" Plain text:"" + plaintext)
print("" Plain Text length:"" + str(len(plaintext)))

Result: Plain Text length : 16
Find next a reduced example of my code: 
from Crypto.Cipher import DES3
import binascii
import base64

plaintext=""Hello Jose      ""
print("" Plain text:"" + plaintext)
print("" Plain Text length:"" + str(len(plaintext)))

#### ENCRYPTION 
key ='173JKL3D93A9CNI1G6NP9A14'
key=bytes(key, 'utf-8')
plaintext_bytes=bytes(plaintext, 'utf-8')
print("" Plain Text length:"" + str(len(plaintext_bytes)))


cipher_encrypt=DES3.new(key)
encrypted_text=cipher_encrypt.encrypt(plaintext_bytes)
print( "" Encrypted word:"" + str(encrypted_text))

#### DECRYPTION
cipher_encrypt=DES3.new(key)
decrypted_text=cipher_encrypt.decrypt(encrypted_text)
print("" Decripted text:"" + str(decrypted_text,'utf-8') + ""\n"")

Can anyone help me to understand why it is not working correctly?
","Goyo is right. The algorithm reads the plain text as a byte-string. Knowing that, the length in bytes of one character with accent is 2. See next example: 
>> a='a'
>> print(""length:"" + str(len(a.encode('utf-8'))))
length:1

>> a='á'
>> print(""length:"" + str(len(a.encode('utf-8'))))
length:2

So, firstly you have to encode the text to bytes and then calculate the length. 
What you could do is calculate the next multiple of 8 and that should be the length of the plain text. After that, you could fill out the string with whitespace to that length.

The nonce which is used is the sequence number of the packet.
Now my question is. Which sequence number is meant here?
I am using tcpdump to get the packet information for the connection and there is a sequence number (code shown below), but it does not seem to work.
I also tried to use 1 or 0 as the sequence number but it also didn't work.
I used the sequence number as a byte array so something like b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01'

Generally when passing ciphertext to a ""decode"" function in crypto libraries it should be passed as a bytes object (as ciphertext can contain arbitrary bytes in general).  For whatever reason it just doesn't accept a bytearray object--that would have to be implemented separately.
code.decode('hex') does the same thing you wanted--it converts a string of hex digits to their actual byte values.
Update for Python 3:
On Python 3 code.decode('hex') won't work.  Instead use bytes.fromhex(code) (similarly to bytearray.fromhex but just return an immutable bytes instance).

","Don't try and convert arbitrary binary data to a Unicode string.  It simply doesn't work that way.  It's like converting arbitrary binary data to a MP3 file and then complaining that it won't play.

I can't get any usefull information from that log. What can I do to install that module and prevent from happening again. 
Also I get the same error when trying to install pycrypto using pyCharm. But I don't get any errors with others modules.

try:
    with open('master_private.pem', 'w+') as keyfile:
    keyfile.write(private_key)

While using ECB, the above works easily, but with CBC, the output scrambles the first 8 char block.
The output here is:
b'{\x03\x1ca\xe3e\xa2\xd4<DEh\x10 \xf63'
b'e\x13\x1a0J~\xa4gloXXXXXX'

I don't see this in the documentation for pycrypto, but I admit, I've not pored over it exhaustively.
Why does the first block get scrambled like this?
","I think I see the problem.... this also happens with AES CBC.  The object maintains the state of the CBC feedback and would use it instead of the IV for the first block.  It would be set to the last value of the encryption operation.  
Subsequent blocks are XORed with the ciphertext so come out clear, meaning only the first block is scrambled.
Creating a new object fixes it:
>>> obj=DES.new('abcdefgh', DES.MODE_CBC, '12345678')
>>> obj.decrypt(ciph)

For my decryption I want to decrypt packet by packet, so now my question is:

Can I somehow get the ""end"" counter of the AES counter in the pycryptodome, so that I can use the ""end"" counter as my new initial counter for the decryption?

It appears to be in a continuous loop of reading 1 and then 63 bytes from the randfunc. My randfunc2 works perfectly, but I want to get randfunc to work and read from live mouse movements. The function I use to generate the key is:
k = RSA.generate(1024, randfunc=x)

Where x is my random function.

"51530041","I am trying to use pycrypto to learn about AES and I do not know what I am doing wrong","This is the code I am using to teach myself how AES works. It is supposed to produce the encrypted message an then produce the decrypted message right after it.  If anyone can help me figure out what I did wrong, it would be greatly appreciated.
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

data = input(' --> ')
data = bytes(data, encoding='utf-8')

key = b'Sixteen byte key'

cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX)
nonce = cipher.nonce

ciphertext = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(data)

print(ciphertext)

ciphertext = str(ciphertext)
ciphertext = bytes(ciphertext, encoding='utf-8')

key = b'Sixteen byte key'
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX, nonce=nonce)

plaintext = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)

print('\n')
print(plaintext)

","The only bytes that you should treat as a string are the bytes that have been encoded as a string in the first place. As ciphertext contains random bytes, there will likely be bytes that do not represent a character - almost any encoding has unused / reserved byte values and / or unprintable characters. If you want to convert ciphertext to actual text, you should use a (binary-to-text) encoding such as base 64.

I am looking for Python libraries which could accomplish but library named ""cryptography""  is issuing some problems(not installation problems).I have read ""pyopenssl"" documentation but unable to write code with their assistance. If someone has code to extract public key into a variable in Python and use it to encrypt a file, please share.
Thank you
