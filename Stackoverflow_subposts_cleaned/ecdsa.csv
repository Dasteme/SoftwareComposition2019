","You can try using the python ecdsa package, using Python3:
pip3 install ecdsa

Usage:
import ecdsa

# SECP256k1 is the Bitcoin elliptic curve
sk = ecdsa.SigningKey.generate(curve=ecdsa.SECP256k1) 
vk = sk.get_verifying_key()
sig = sk.sign(b""message"")
vk.verify(sig, b""message"") # True

To verify an existing signature with a public key:
import ecdsa

message = b""message""
public_key = '98cedbb266d9fc38e41a169362708e0509e06b3040a5dfff6e08196f8d9e49cebfb4f4cb12aa7ac34b19f3b29a17f4e5464873f151fd699c2524e0b7843eb383'

vk = ecdsa.VerifyingKey.from_string(bytes.fromhex(public_key), curve=ecdsa.SECP256k1)
vk.verify(bytes.fromhex(sig), message) # True

The package is compatible with Python 2 as well

I am currently hosting a website on Windows 2012 that I would like to get the latest TLS 1.2 ciphersuites running on.
I am aware of how to enable TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 in windows and have done so(via registry edits). I have also changed the cipher order to what I would like it to be.
My question is: How do i actually go through and set up my ECDHE / ECDSA portion of the cipher suite after this step?
When i view the site in the latest chrome beta (which supports ECDHE and ECDSA in TLS 1.2 provided you use the supported curves) it seems to skip all of the ECHDE ciphersuites.
Is there something else i need to do to get ECDHE/ECDSA properly enabled?
I have read around on the net trying to solve this myself and they mention making copies of your root cert and then modifying them to somehow support ECDHE. Am i barking up the wrong tree?
Thank you in advance for any and all support with this issue.
Edit: adding clarification/progress
After more research, I have found that in order to get ECDSA to work, you need an ECDSA certificate. The only way to get one at this time is to self-sign, as the cert-cartel has not yet come up with proper cross-licensing agreements and fee structures for Ellipic Curve Certificates yet.
Since self-signing is not an option for this site, I have removed all ECDSA suites from the cipher-order.
Unfortunately, because all of the AES Galois Counter Mode suites were also ECDSA, this rules those out for the time being.
This leaves me with a strongest cipher suite of ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384_P521 which I BELIEVE is supported by the latest version of Chrome beta correct? I can't seem to get Chrome to pick up anything beyond SHA-1. Is there no SHA-2 support? even in the latest beta?
","AES-GCM is about how you encrypt the data in your connexion, EC-DSA or RSA about how the server identifies itself to the client. There is therefore no reason why you couldn't do AES-GCM encryption with a RSA authentication.
RFC 5289 does define the needed suite for that :
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5289#section-3.2

CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256    = {0xC0,0x2F};

CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384     = {0xC0,0x32};

","Jackpot - nothing in your title is a problem!
First, you probably aren't actually using BouncyCastle. Sun/Oracle Java 7 and 8 now includes an EC provider (earlier versions did not) and the one-arg form of getInstance uses the first available provider, which is normally SunEC unless you or someone has altered the provider list.
TO VERIFY A SIGNATURE: pass the same data to the verifying Signature.update() as you passed to the signing Signature.update(). Exactly the same, byte for byte. Pass the signature value only to Signature.verify(). Putting PrivateKey.toString() in the data is silly; this value is specific to the running Java process, so you'll have to send it to the receiving process (if different, as it normally should be) where it is useless and a waste of space.
TO USE A STATIC KEY: do just that. Create a keypair and store it someplace, then read it in and use it. The easiest secure (password protected) store is a Java KeyStore (JKS) file, but that requires a certificate chain (perhaps a dummy one) which is a nuisance to code yourself; fortunately the keytool utility with -genkeypair generates a keypair with a dummy selfsigned certificate, and for -keyalg ec -keysize 256 it uses the (very popular) secp256r1 curve. Also specify -alias name of your choice, -keystore filename, any names you like for the dummy cert, and passwords. To use a keypair from a JKS file:

use java.security.KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS"") to create a store object and pass .load(InputStream,char[]) a FileInputStream on the file, and the password.
use .getKey(String alias,char[] password) and cast to get the PrivateKey. Use for signing.
use .getCertificateChain(String alias)[0].getPublicKey() to get the PublicKey from the first (only) cert. Use for verifying.

I see the typical warning:

How do I verify the fingerprint before I sign in? 
Ideally an answer is based on something besides the original creation console log -- because the log may get flushed out after a system restart, or during a large system installation script that generates a lot of output, or the connection is to an older system with keys that weren't tracked at creation time.
","Here are two solutions that worked for me during the creation of the EC2 system. 
Solution 1: Use the Amazon EC2 dashboard

Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com
Tap ""EC2"" link.
Tap ""Instances"" in the left column
Tap the instance name you want
Tap the select button ""Actions"" and choose ""Get System Log"" (a.k.a. ""Console Output"")
In the console output, you should see the keys being generated

Solution 2: Use the AWS EC2 command line
You can use the aws command or ec2-get-console-output command. Both are available for download from Amazon.
To use your EC2 private key pem file, certificate pem file, region, and instance:
ec2-get-console-output \
  --private-key pk-ABCDEF1234567890.pem \
  --cert cert-ABCDEF1234567890.pem \
  --region us-east-1c \
  i-e706689a   

The output shows the ssh host key fingerprints like this:
ec2: -----BEGIN SSH HOST KEY FINGERPRINTS-----
ec2: 1024 e0:79:1e:ba:2e:3c:71:87:2c:f5:62:2b:0d:1b:6d:7b  root@ip-10-243-118-182 (DSA)

ec2: -----END SSH HOST KEY FINGERPRINTS-----

The aws tool works similarly. 
Note: these solutions only work during creation time, or when you can get the console logs. For a broader solution that works any time, see Martin's answer.

","As @joelparkerhenderson's answer covers, you can collect host key fingerprint from server's initial start log, when host keys are generated (by the cloud-init script):


If you fail to collect the keys this way, you can get them by connecting to your target instance from another trusted instance within private Amazon network, thus keeping yourself safe from man-in-the-middle attacks. 
When on the trusted instance (the one you know fingerprints for) terminal, you can use following commands to collect fingerprints (172.33.31.199 is the private IP):
$ ssh-keyscan 172.33.31.199 > ec2key
$ ssh-keygen -l -f ec2key
256 SHA256:oZHeiMEPLKetRgd3M5Itgwaqr2zJJH93EvSdx5UoHbQ <ip> (ED25519)

256 SHA256:L7UXLw0djE5B9W7ZhvrkYVSTZyi1MEQ2dBaRtpkkUGY <ip> (ECDSA)


If you do not have another instance, whose fingerprints you know, create new temporary instance, just for the purpose of collecting the keys. First find keys for the new temporary instance, using it's initial start log. Connect to the temporary instance from public network. Then collect keys of the target instance by connecting to it from the temporary instance, over private Amazon network. After that you can discard the temporary instance.

I have prepared Guide for connecting to EC2 instance safely using WinSCP.

","It depends on how you encode the signature. This is the code segment from OpenSSL that measures the length of ECDSA signature in DER format. 
/** ECDSA_size

    unsigned char buf[4];

    group = EC_KEY_get0_group(r);
    if (group == NULL)
        return 0;

    if ((order = BN_new()) == NULL) return 0;
    if (!EC_GROUP_get_order(group,order,NULL))

    bs.length=(i+7)/8;
    bs.data=buf;

Can anyone tell me if it is somehow possible to use the SHA-256 signature algorithm with an OpenSSL installation on Yosemite? 

Yes, but you need to install a more recent version OpenSSL. OS X's 0.9.8 lacks elliptic curve support (among other things).


The latest version of OpenSSL seems to be 1.0.2, but the source available at https://www.openssl.org/source/ does not seem to be compilable for OS X, since the file ""Install.MacOS"" says right at the beginning:

Ignore that because its wrong.
See the OpenSSL wiki on Compilation and Installation. The 30 second fly-by on 64-bit OS X:
export KERNEL_BITS=64
cd openssl
./config shared no-ssl2 no-ssl3 no-comp enable-ec_nistp_64_gcc_128 --openssldir=/usr/local
make all
sudo make install

Ignore the prompt about make depend since you don't need it.

Related: if you want to build a fat OpenSSL, then see this question: Build Multiarch OpenSSL on OS X. The short answer is, don't try because it won't work due to OpenSSL makefiles.
If you want a fat library, the perform the following steps:
export KERNL_BITS=64
./configure ...
...

When you need to use OpenSSL in your programs, you will use /usr/local/ssl/include as a header path, and /usr/local/ssl/lib as a library path.
As a matter of fact, I don't use library paths because OS X's linker ignores your request for static linking. I use static linking to avoid LD_PRELOAD and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH problems and tricks (like compiling against 1.0.2 in /usr/local/ssl, but loading 0.9.8 at runtime in /usr/lib). So my compile like looks something like:
gcc foo.c bar.c /usr/local/ssl/lib/libcrypto.a -o foobar.exe

An archive is a collection of object files (*.o), so you specify them just like any other object file.

The latest version of OpenSSL seems to be 1.0.2, but the source available at https://www.openssl.org/source/ does not seem to be compilable for OS X, since the file ""Install.MacOS"" says right at the beginning:
""Thanks to Roy Wood  initial support for Mac OS (pre
X) is now provided.""
My try to install it nevertheless resulted in some errors on the command line.
Can anyone tell me if it is somehow possible to use the SHA-256 signature algorithm with an OpenSSL installation on Yosemite? It seems odd to me if this would not be possible, but I am no expert in this field.
Hoping for a good hint!
","On OSX El Capitan

Install homebrew (see http://brew.sh/index.html)
Install newest openssl version with command brew install openssl
Run /usr/local/opt/openssl/bin/openssl sha256

Brew now refuses to link openssh to /usr/local/bin even if you use the --force option so you have to run openssh from the brew install location or link to it yourself.

UPDATE:

","You are claiming your raw key is in OpenSSL's DER format, which it isn't. Also you are claming a private key is a public key, which it isn't, and claiming it's password-encrypted which is wrong either way: public keys are never encrypted and private keys in OpenSSL's 'traditional' aka 'legacy' algorithm-specific DER formats (for ECC, defined by SECG SEC1) cannot be encrypted. (OTOH private keys in PKCS8 format can be password-encrypted in either DER or PEM, although PEM is more convenient. And FWIW PKCS12 format is always password-encrypted, and always DER.) 
An ECC (ECDSA, ECDH, ECMQV, etc) key is always relative to some 'curve' (more exactly, prime-order subgroup over a curve with an identified generator aka base point). For bitcoin this is secp256k1, but your question doesn't say it's limited to bitcoin and this answer would require modification for other applications using other curves.
If you also have the public key (as an uncompressed point), you can simply use the solution from https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/66594/signing-transaction-with-ssl-private-key-to-pem . Concatenate the hex strings:
  a pre_string : 30740201010420
  the privkey  : (32 bytes as 64 hexits) 
  a mid_string : a00706052b8104000aa144034200 (identifies secp256k1) 
  the pubkey   : (65 bytes as 130 hexits)

and then either convert the hex to binary and read as DER, or convert the hex (probably via binary) to base64 and wrap with -----BEGIN/END EC PRIVATE KEY----- lines to make it PEM.
If you don't have the public key, you can modify this slightly. Concatenate the hex strings 
302e0201010420 privkey_32bytes_64hexits a00706052b8104000a 

and convert to binary, then read into openssl ec -inform d . Note OpenSSL will derive the public key from the private key given the curve, but not actually store it in the PEM output, so reading with software other than OpenSSL is not guaranteed. You might need to use openssl ec -text [-noout] (on either PEM or DER input as convenient) to get the public key value, then go back and create the fuller encoding that includes the public key as above.

ADDED: since you seem not to comprehend the words in the answer, I'll lay this out in as much detail as I can.
The value a140bd507a57360e2fa503298c035854f0dcb248bedabbe7a14db3920aaacf57 is the raw private key represented in hex. A secp256k1 private value is 32 bytes in binary; when binary is represented in hex each byte takes two hex digits, so 32 bytes takes 64 hex digits. All of this value is the raw private key. There is no part consisting of 25 digits OR 25 bytes that has any useful meaning whatever. Do not take any 25-anything part of this value.
To construct the OpenSSL/SECG representation of a private key with no public key, put the hex string representing the private key -- all of it, without modification -- between the two other hex strings I showed as the second option:
 302e0201010420 a140bd507a57360e2fa503298c035854f0dcb248bedabbe7a14db3920aaacf57 a00706052b8104000a 

Then convert this combined hex string to binary, and read the result into openssl ec -inform d:
$ echo 302e0201010420 a140bd507a57360e2fa503298c035854f0dcb248bedabbe7a14db3920aaacf57 a00706052b8104000a | xxd -r -p >48101258.1

MC4CAQEEIKFAvVB6VzYOL6UDKYwDWFTw3LJIvtq756FNs5IKqs9XoAcGBSuBBAAK
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----

The result is PEM format -- but PEM format not including the public key, which you indicate you want. To see the fields including the derived public key, add -text; to see only the fields and not the PEM output, add -noout:
$ openssl ec -inform d <48101258.1 -text -noout

Now if you want a PEM-format key including the public key, take both the hex strings for the private key (all 64 digits) AND the newly-shown hex value for the public key, and plug them in to my first option. Also note an ECC public key is a curve point which can be in two forms, compressed or uncompressed; the form generated here is uncompressed. If you need compressed, I'll add that later. A secp256k1 point in uncompressed form is 65 bytes, represented in hex as 130 hex digits. (Which openssl ec formats as 4 lines each of 15 bytes with 5 bytes left over.)

ADDED 2019-02 for DavidS: as correctly shown in k06a's answer

the first part of my midstring (or the entire suffix for my private-only option) a00706052b8104000a is a context-tag and length a007 for an OID tag and length 0605 containing 2b8104000a which is 1.3.132.0.10 which is secp256k1 and 
the remainder of my midstring a144034200 is a context tag and length containing the tag length and unused-bits header for a BITSTRING which is the raw publickey as an uncompressed point.

To do secp256r1 aka P-256 or prime256v1 instead, you need to change the AlgId.OID to 1.2.840.10045.3.1.7 which is encoded as a00a 0608 2a8648ce3d030107. The privatekey and publickey values for p256r1 are the same sizes as for p256k1, but the AlgId is longer, so you also need to change the length of the outer SEQUENCE giving
30770201010420 privatekey32bytes # note 77

Can someone point me out what I'm missing here?
EDIT: Solution
As Peter Dettman pointed in his answer, the signature was not correctly formatted (also content was incorrect too) in order to be computed by the verify() method. Here is a good explanation that mainly says that:

When encoded in DER, this (signature) becomes the following sequence of bytes:
0x30 b1 0x02 b2 (vr) 0x02 b3 (vs)
where:

b1 is a single byte value, equal to the length, in bytes, of the remaining list of bytes (from the first 0x02 to the end of the encoding);
b2 is a single byte value, equal to the length, in bytes, of (vr);
b3 is a single byte value, equal to the length, in bytes, of (vs);
(vr) is the signed big-endian encoding of the value ""r"", of minimal length;
(vs) is the signed big-endian encoding of the value ""s"", of minimal length.


Applying that change, signature grows to 70 bytes and the execution outputs no error.
","The expected ECDSA signature format that the BC (and other provider) implementations work with is a DER-encoded ASN.1 sequence containing two integer values r and s. This signature format has been specified in ANSI X9.62. This is the format in the first set of data you give (note that signature is a total of 70 bytes).
In the second set of data, signature is only 32 bytes, and is not an ASN.1 sequence at all. I would guess that this value is only the s value, and it is missing the r value and the ASN.1 INTEGER encoding for them both, instead encoding the values as a unsigned big integer value with the same size as the key.

"30945722","Converting byte array to publickey ECDSA","I need to use ECDSA algorithm to sign a message and send to receiver in java. Then, receiver should verify sender's signature.
So, for this, receiver has sender's public key but in byte array format after converting java.security.PublicKey to byte array by the command bellow:
byte[] byteArrayPublicKey = publickey.getEncoded();

The format of public key in ECDSA algorithm (before converting it to byte array) is as follow:
Public Key:
X: 8a83c389e7bb817c17bf2db4ed71055f18342b630221b2a3a1ca752502dc2e21

Y: 3eaf48c9ab1700fe0966a0cde196b85af66bb8f0bacef711c9dca2368f9d8470

But, the problem is to convert this byte array to usable format to verify the signature that is java.security.PublicKey by receiver. 
In general, is there any solution to verify the signature without converting it to byte array? In the other word, the problem is to verify the signature by sender's public key, using any method.
","
But, the problem is to convert this byte array to usable format to verify the signature that is java.security.PublicKey by receiver.

You can solve the problem like this way:
public static ECPublicKey genEcPubKey() throws Exception {
    KeyFactory factory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""ECDSA"", ""BC"");
    java.security.PublicKey ecPublicKey = (ECPublicKey) factory
            .generatePublic(new X509EncodedKeySpec(Helper
                    .toByte(ecRemotePubKey))); // Helper.toByte(ecRemotePubKey)) is java.security.PublicKey#getEncoded()
    return (ECPublicKey) ecPublicKey;
}

Note that, you need BouncyCastle provider to do that.
But question remains, how you generate the private key?
public KeyPair ecKeyPairGenerator(String curveName) throws Exception {
    KeyPair keyPair;
    KeyPairGenerator keyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(
            ""ECDSA"", ""BC"");
    ECGenParameterSpec ecGenParameterSpec = new ECGenParameterSpec(
            curveName);
    keyPairGenerator.initialize(ecGenParameterSpec, new SecureRandom());
    keyPair = keyPairGenerator.generateKeyPair();
    java.security.PublicKey ecPublicKey = (ECPublicKey) keyPair.getPublic();
    System.out.println(""JAVA EC PublicKey: ""
            + Helper.toHex(ecPublicKey.getEncoded()));

    // write private key into a file. Just for testing purpose
    FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(
            ""ECPrivateKey.key"");
    ObjectOutputStream objectOutputStream = new ObjectOutputStream(
            fileOutputStream);
    objectOutputStream.writeObject(keyPair.getPrivate());
    objectOutputStream.close();
    return keyPair;
}

I think that the data format is defined in some specification or standard. I just want to know the document name.
","The public key value is  an uncompressed point. It is defined by value 04, which is an identifier for an uncompressed point, followed by the X and Y coordinate, where the X and Y are encoded as unsigned big endian octet strings that have the same size as the key size (same as the size of the order of the curve in the parameters). Note that 04 is also the tag for an OCTET STRING in ASN.1, but that has nothing to do with the uncompressed point indicator.
The format of the domain parameters is unknown to me. It's certainly not encoded as  https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5480.txt as Paul suggests. I presume it is some proprietary DER format, which uses multiple ASN.1 SEQUENCE values filled with two ASN.1 INTEGER values each. These integer values (after the length) are signed, unpadded, big endian encodings, which fortunately are completely compatible with the encoding of Java's BigInteger.
Paul Bastian is correct with regards to the signature generated, it's X9.42 compatible. Plain signatures are not yet supported by Java Card.

"17439732","Recreating Keys (ECPublicKeyParameters) in C# with BouncyCastle","I generate an AsymmetricCipherKeyPair as follows:
string curveName = ""P-521"";
X9ECParameters ecP = NistNamedCurves.GetByName(curveName);
ECDomainParameters ecSpec = new ECDomainParameters(ecP.Curve, ecP.G, ecP.N, ecP.H, ecP.GetSeed());
IAsymmetricCipherKeyPairGenerator g = GeneratorUtilities.GetKeyPairGenerator(""ECDH"");
g.Init(new ECKeyGenerationParameters(ecSpec, new SecureRandom()));
AsymmetricCipherKeyPair aKeyPair = g.GenerateKeyPair();

My intention was to extract the public and private keys and then rebuild the keys later. I first extracted the keys as follows:
byte[] privateKey = ((ECPrivateKeyParameters)aKeyPair.Private).D.ToByteArray();
byte[] publicKey = ((ECPublicKeyParameters)aKeyPair.Public).Q.GetEncoded();

How do I recreate the public and private key parameters so that I can use them? In this example, I do recreate the private key and then sign the data byte array.
public static byte[] SignData(byte[] data, byte[] privateKey)
{
    string curveName = ""P-521"";
    X9ECParameters ecP = NistNamedCurves.GetByName(curveName);
    ECDomainParameters ecSpec = new ECDomainParameters(ecP.Curve, ecP.G, ecP.N, ecP.H, ecP.GetSeed());
    ISigner signer = SignerUtilities.GetSigner(""SHA-256withECDSA"");
    BigInteger biPrivateKey = new BigInteger(privateKey);
    ECPrivateKeyParameters keyParameters = new ECPrivateKeyParameters(biPrivateKey, ecSpec);
    signer.Init(true, keyParameters);
    signer.BlockUpdate(data, 0, data.Length);
    return signer.GenerateSignature();
}

Although it feels like a real hack, it works just fine. How can I do this with the Public Key? I set the variable xxx to (ECPublicKeyParameters)aKeyPair.Public and I can use the code below to verify the signature. Note that I could use xxx directly, but the point is to serialize xxx out and then back in, so, this code actually does convert the xxx variable and creates a new one, which is stored in xx. I then use xx to verify (which shows that I can round trip the key). 
var xx = PublicKeyFactory.CreateKey(Org.BouncyCastle.X509.SubjectPublicKeyInfoFactory.CreateSubjectPublicKeyInfo(xxx).GetDerEncoded());
ISigner signer = SignerUtilities.GetSigner(""SHA-256withECDSA"");
signer.Init(false, xx);
signer.BlockUpdate(data, 0, data.Length);
return signer.VerifySignature(signature);

I had hoped that I could create the key (xx) from Q.GetEncoded() similar to how I did it for the private key. 
Is there a better way to rebuild the private key? also using an ASN.1 encoding? If so, perhaps I should use that instead.
","I can do this as follows:
string curveName = ""P-521"";
X9ECParameters ecP = NistNamedCurves.GetByName(curveName);
FpCurve c = (FpCurve)ecP.Curve;
ECFieldElement x = new FpFieldElement(c.Q, xxx.Q.X.ToBigInteger());
ECFieldElement y = new FpFieldElement(c.Q, xxx.Q.Y.ToBigInteger());
ECPoint q = new FpPoint(c, x, y);
ECPublicKeyParameters xxpk = new ECPublicKeyParameters(""ECDH"", q, SecObjectIdentifiers.SecP521r1);

Then, I can use xxpk to verify the signature.

","Java's default encoding for a PublicKey is ""X.509"" which is not just the EC point; it is an ASN.1 structure identifying the algorithm (EC) and parameters (here prime256v1) PLUS a BIT STRING wrapping the point; see rfc5280 section 4.2.1.7 and rfc3279 section 2.3.5. 
Similarly the default encoding for PrivateKey is ""PKCS#8"" (unencrypted) which is a structure containing an AlgorithmIdentifier plus an OCTET STRING wrapping the data which in this case contains both the private key value and a copy of the public key, see rfc5208 section 5 and C.4 of document SEC 1 at http://www.secg.org with tag [0] omitted but tag [1] present.
To read (either or both of) them back in to Java, get a KeyFactory.getInstance(""EC"") and use generate{Public,Private} on an X509EncodedKeySpec or PKCS8EncodedKeySpec respectively.
ECDSA and ECDH (and ECMQV etc) use the same key structures, unlike classic integer DSA and DH which use the same mathematical structure ($Z_p^*$) but slightly different representations.

The site ECDSA sample give me ""Invalid ECDSA signature message"", and them seems really very different from that smaller Private Key and always starting with ""04"" Public Key generated in the same site.
Also, my backend verification gives me the error ""Invalid point encoding 0x30""
The backend Java method check is:
public ECPublicKey getPublicKeyFromHex(String publicKeyHex)
        throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, DecoderException, ApplicationGenericException {
    byte[] rawPublicKey = Hex.decodeHex(publicKeyHex.toCharArray());
    ECPublicKey ecPublicKey = null;
    KeyFactory kf = null;

    ECCurve curve = ecNamedCurveParameterSpec.getCurve();
    EllipticCurve ellipticCurve = EC5Util.convertCurve(curve, ecNamedCurveParameterSpec.getSeed());
    java.security.spec.ECPoint ecPoint = ECPointUtil.decodePoint(ellipticCurve, rawPublicKey);
    java.security.spec.ECParameterSpec ecParameterSpec = EC5Util.convertSpec(ellipticCurve,
            ecNamedCurveParameterSpec);
    java.security.spec.ECPublicKeySpec publicKeySpec = new java.security.spec.ECPublicKeySpec(ecPoint,
            ecParameterSpec);

    kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""ECDSA"", new BouncyCastleProvider());

    try {
        ecPublicKey = (ECPublicKey) kf.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new ApplicationGenericException(e.getMessage(), e.getCause());
    }

    return ecPublicKey;
}

","More practical example. Convert generated public key to decoded bytes array or hex string:  
public String getPublicKeyAsHex(PublicKey publicKey){

    ECPublicKey ecPublicKey = (ECPublicKey)publicKey;
    ECPoint ecPoint = ecPublicKey.getW();

    byte[] publicKeyBytes = new byte[PUBLIC_KEY_LENGTH];
    writeToStream(publicKeyBytes, 0, ecPoint.getAffineX(), PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH);
    writeToStream(publicKeyBytes, PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH, ecPoint.getAffineY(), PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH);

    String hex = Hex.toHexString(publicKeyBytes);

    logger.debug(""Public key bytes: "" + Arrays.toString(publicKeyBytes));
    logger.debug(""Public key hex: "" + hex);

    return hex;
}

private void writeToStream(byte[] stream, int start, BigInteger value, int size) {
    byte[] data = value.toByteArray();
    int length = Math.min(size, data.length);
    int writeStart = start + size - length;
    int readStart = data.length - length;
    System.arraycopy(data, readStart, stream, writeStart, length);
}

Convert decoded bytes array back to PublicKey:
KeyFactory factory = KeyFactory.getInstance(ALGORITHM, ALGORITHM_PROVIDER);

ECNamedCurveParameterSpec spec = ECNamedCurveTable.getParameterSpec(CURVE);

ECNamedCurveSpec params = new ECNamedCurveSpec(CURVE, spec.getCurve(), spec.getG(), spec.getN());

BigInteger xCoordinate = new BigInteger(1, Arrays.copyOfRange(decodedPublicKey, 0, PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH));
BigInteger yCoordinate = new BigInteger(1, Arrays.copyOfRange(decodedPublicKey, PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH, PUBLIC_KEY_LENGTH));
java.security.spec.ECPoint w = new java.security.spec.ECPoint(xCoordinate, yCoordinate);

PublicKey encodedPublicKey = factory.generatePublic(new java.security.spec.ECPublicKeySpec(w, params));

","It would seem that ecparam doesn't have a built-in option for encrypting the generated key. Instead, you can simply do the following:
openssl ec -in myprivatekey.pem -out myprivatekey_encrypted.pem -aes256

Compared to genrsa, an extra step is required, but this basically does the same thing.

Now as far as the certificate request, the command is pretty much the same regardless of the type of private key used:
openssl req -new -sha256 -key myprivatekey.pem -out mycertrequest.pem

You can then take the resulting mycertrequest.pem and send it to a CA for signing.

Edit:
If you have concerns about writing the unencrypted private key to disk, you can do both the generation and encryption of the key in one step like so:
openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp256k1 | openssl ec -aes256 -out privatekey.pem

This generates a P-256 key, then prompts you for a passphrase. The key is then encrypted using AES256 and saved into privatekey.pem.

How to implement ECDSA curve secp256k1 in PHP?
Or rather: Are there any solutions - ie. includable specialized classes - already done?
I can see there are plenty of opensource libraries, classes and stuff available for other languages (JavaScript, Python,...) but I've just spent whole afternoon googling for some/any PHP solution and ... nothing!.
This is for a bitcoin project of mine and I need a way how to generate public key from private key ... and then I want to generate the final bitcoin address.
I know how to generate private key (don't worry about it being random or not - not an issue here) and I have both 256bit hexadecimal and WIF notations. But the next step: coming up with a public key and then final bitcoin address, is kind of a problem to me, as I have literally zero cryptograph-ish background and I know the solution is to utilize secp256k1 somehow.
This is what I have so far:
// Random bytes
// $private_key = bin2hex(openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(32));
// But using brainwallet.org style to have easy comparison
$passphrase = ""correct horse battery staple"";
$private_key = hash('sha256', $passphrase);
var_dump (""PrivKey: $private_key"");
// Bitcoin::privKeyToWIF from github.com/mikegogulski/bitcoin-php
$wif = Bitcoin::privKeyToWIF($private_key); 
var_dump (""WIF PrivKey: $wif"");
// And now I don't know where to even start ...

tl;dr How to implement this in PHP? (..and privKey->pubKey conversion before that)
http://i.stack.imgur.com/U2neg.png
I know about...

http://github.com/mikegogulski/bitcoin-php .. Which is pretty neat and has lots of useful methods and ways how to control bitcoind via RPC, but unfortunately pure PHP method that could handle privKey->pubKey mechanism is missing.
http://bitcoinphp.com/ .. I couldn't find it in there.
openssl extension in PHP, but unfortunately the only digest method OPENSSL-PHP documentation is mentioning is 'ecdsa-with-SHA1', and correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd need 'ecdsa-with-SHA256', or something like that (?)
I even tried to convert the algorithm from bitcoinjs.js, but with my crypto-knowledge I was unable to extract the gist of anything. I simply don't understand those curves and their bit operations and other spooky stuff.

I'm looking for PURE PHP solution. I'm not looking for using shell running bitcoind and then parse JSON for key pairs and then...
Why there is no piece of code that could handle this entirely in PHP? OR IS THERE?! :)

You are using OpenSSL's random number generator, and its not thread safe. Below is from cryptlib.c around line 125. Notice the random number generators and the elliptic curve gear make the list.

You have to explicitly set the locks. See OpenSSL's threads(3).


Is it possible split the creation of keys into multiple threads without corrupting memory?

Yes, but you have to use OpenSSL's locking mechanism.

If you are not using libssl, then forgo the call to SSL_library_init. All libcrypto needs is the call to OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms to initialize.


The SSL Documentation doesn't mention anything about thread-safety, though.

Yeah, the docs leave something to be desired at times. I know a bunch of folks are working on improving it through a wiki run by the OpenSSL Foundation. Matt Caswell has done a lot of work in simply documenting the elliptic curve stuff at http://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Elliptic_Curve_Cryptography. He's also responsible for the POD files and MAN pages. Keep in mind that Matt did not write any of the code - he's just documenting it for others.
There's a page on initialization, but it does not have the code for the locks. Its on my TODO list. See http://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Library_Initialization.

","dbugger was right. DER encoding is wrong. The code in question should be replaced by:
    private static byte[] derEncodeSignature(byte[] signature)
    {
        byte[] r = signature.RangeSubset(0, (signature.Length / 2));
        byte[] s = signature.RangeSubset((signature.Length / 2), (signature.Length / 2));

        MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream();
        DerOutputStream der = new DerOutputStream(stream);

        Asn1EncodableVector v = new Asn1EncodableVector();
        v.Add(new DerInteger(new BigInteger(1, r)));
        v.Add(new DerInteger(new BigInteger(1, s)));
        der.WriteObject(new DerSequence(v));

        return stream.ToArray();

","There are no default EC domain parameters in Java Card. It is required to create the KeyPair using an ECPublicKey and a ECPrivateKey for which the domain parameters are set (so the point W and secret S may be kept empty). After that it is possible to call genKeyPair(), at least if the card has support for F(2m) or F(p) Elliptic Curve cryptography and the key size that is specified.

ADDED
Note that NXP JCOP chips may require these parameters set for the public and the private key. The parameters should have either the key size (for separate values) or an uncompressed Elliptic Curve point. The value of G in the question seems to be a compressed point. Only the cofactor (for setH) should just have the value 1.
Note that only the chips with an asymmetric coprocessor may support elliptic curves; not all cards are created / configured equally. Contact your vendor for details.

","If an attempt to create instance of the particular algorithm (KeyPair.ALG_EC_FP & KeyBuilder.LENGTH_EC_FP_192 in your case) fails with NO_SUCH_ALGORITHM, it is either not supported by your card completely (e.g., old hardware) or disabled. 
Project JCAlgTester allows you to obtain complete list of the supported algorithms for your particular card. Database of results for multiple different cards is also available (but is better to check your particular card directly by uploading JCAlgTester applet).

","The field of the elliptic curve is not over the field of real numbers. It's over a finite field modulo some prime. 
For Secp256k1 the prime p = 2^256 - 2^32 - 2^9 - 2^8 - 2^7 - 2^6 - 2^4 - 1.
Thus: y^2= (x^3) + 7 (mod p)
There's no direct way to solve the equation, you would need to use Cipolla's algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipolla%27s_algorithm

","You need to calculate in the field , which mostly means that you have to reduce your number to the remainder after dividing with p after each calculation. Calculating this is called taking the modulo and is written as % p in python.
Exponentiating in this field can be done more effectively than the naive way of just multiplying and reducing many times. This is called modular exponentiation.  Python's built-in exponentation function pow(n,e,p) can take care of this.
The remaining problem is to find the square root. Luckily secp256k1 is chosen in a special way (), so that taking square roots is easy: A square root of x is .
So a simplified version of your code becomes:
import binascii

p_hex = 'FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEFFFFFC2F'
p = int(p_hex, 16)
compressed_key_hex = '0250863AD64A87AE8A2FE83C1AF1A8403CB53F53E486D8511DAD8A04887E5B2352'
x_hex = compressed_key_hex[2:66]
x = int(x_hex, 16)
prefix = compressed_key_hex[0:2]

y_square = (pow(x, 3, p)  + 7) % p
y_square_square_root = pow(y_square, (p+1)/4, p)
if (prefix == ""02"" and y_square_square_root & 1) or (prefix == ""03"" and not y_square_square_root & 1):
    y = (-y_square_square_root) % p
else:

"36624105","generate certificate using ECDSA in c#","I'm trying to generate (self-signed) certificate with private key using ECDSA.
The goals is to get ""the same"" (pkcs12) certificate as when using openssl:
openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp256r1 -out mykey.key
openssl req -new -key mykey.key -out myreq.csr
openssl req -x509 -days 7 -key mykey.key -in myreq.csr -out mycert.crt
openssl pkcs12 -export -out mycert.pfx -inkey mykey.key -in mycert.crt

I already use BouncyCastle to help me with creating RSA-based certificate(s), so next steps more or less follow the way I use to create RSA certs.
(note that BC prefix is used for classes from BouncyCastle, MS for .NET classes)
1 generate key pair: private and public keys
BC.IAsymmetricCipherKeyPairGenerator bcKpGen = BC.GeneratorUtilities.GetKeyPairGenerator(""ECDSA"");
bcKpGen.Init(new BC.ECKeyGenerationParameters(BC.SecObjectIdentifiers.SecP256r1, new BC.SecureRandom()));
BC.AsymmetricCipherKeyPair bcSubjKeys = bcKpGen.GenerateKeyPair();

2 use private key to sign public key with some additional data (subject, validity period etc)
BC.X509V3CertificateGenerator bcXgen = new BC.X509V3CertificateGenerator();
// .. set subject, validity period etc
bcXgen.SetPublicKey(bcSubjKeys.Public);
BC.ISignatureFactory bcSigFac = new BC.Asn1SignatureFactory(""SHA256WITHECDSA"", bcSubjKeys.Private);
BC.X509Certificate bcCert = bcXgen.Generate(bcSigFac);

3 ""join"" private key from step1 and certificate from step2 to get certificate with private key.
If I'm ok with certificate without private key, I could do something like:
MS.X509Certificate mcCert = new MS.X509Certificate2(bcCert.GetEncoded(), null);

and I'm done.
The issue(s) come when trying to set private-key:
msCert.PrivateKey = ConvertBouncyToNetSomehow(bcSubjKeys.Private)

(note that typeof msCert.PrivateKey is MS.AsymmetricAlgorithm and the type of bcSubjKeys.Private is BC.ECPrivateKeyParameters)
It seems that suitable way is using MS.ECDsaCng class (which inherits from MS.AsymmetricAlgorithm), but:
1 The only way I found to convert BC.ECPrivateKeyParameters to MS.CngKey (required by MS.ECDsaCng) is via pkcs8 format:
BC.PrivateKeyInfo bcPKInfo = BC.PrivateKeyInfoFactory.CreatePrivateKeyInfo(bcSubjKeys.Private);
byte[] pkArr = bcPKInfo.GetDerEncoded();
MS.CngKey msPKCng = MS.CngKey.Import(pkArr, MS.CngKeyBlobFormat.Pkcs8PrivateBlob);

but using this approach some information is lost because value of msPKCng.AlgorithmGroup is ""ECDH"" while bcSubjKeys.Private.AlgorithmNamesays ""ECDSA"". Also ECDH-key cannot be used with MS.ECDsaCng.
Nevertheless.. I could continue with MS.ECDiffieHellmanCng instead of requested MS.ECDsaCng if..
2 implementation of MS.X509Certificate2.set_PrivateKey requires the object implements interface MS.ICspAsymmetricAlgorithm. But neither one of them (ECDsaCng, ECDiffieHellmanCng) implement it.
At this point it seems different approach must be used (because of MS.ICspAsymmetricAlgorithm condition), e.g. export certificate and private key to pkcs file and use X509Certificate2.Import(..).
Any hint?

","Unfortunately, it's not possible to do straight out of the box right now.  You can get the rest of the way with P/Invokes and .NET 4.6.2 (currently in preview). Or, with a detour through .NET Core you can build a PFX that works in .NET 4.6.1.
""ECDSA"" vs ""ECDH""
The Windows CNG libraries split ECC into ECDSA and ECDH. ECDSA key objects can only be used for ECDSA; but whenever Windows can't determine the usage during a PFX import (or PKCS#8 import) it calls a private key ECDH.  Why? Because Windows lets ECDH key objects do both key agreement (ECDH) and digital signature (ECDSA), so ECDH is more flexible.
But .NET 4.6.1 didn't know that.
.NET Core doesn't have this limitation (see https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/5850), and .NET 4.6.2 has also removed the restriction (per https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/blob/master/releases/net462/dotnet462-changes.md#user-content-bcl).
Generating ""ECDSA"" keys, instead of ""ECDH""
.NET Core now has an ImportParameters method on ECDsa. If you can translate the BC.ECPrivateKeyProperty object to an MS.ECParameters structure you can import the blob into an ECDsaCng object. (Be sure to use it as a named curve, instead of explicitly copying all of the curve parameters).
Since it was purposefully imported into an ECDsa object it gets an ECDSA key, and that information will be embedded in the PFX.
Building the PFX (tying it all together)
With a bit of P/Invoking you can convince Windows to build a PFX using an ephemeral key. While .NET can't access ephemeral private keys from certificates, it will be able to make use of it if loaded from a PFX:
[DllImport(Libraries.Crypt32, CharSet = CharSet.Unicode, SetLastError = true)]
private static extern unsafe bool CertSetCertificateContextProperty(IntPtr pCertContext, CertContextPropId dwPropId, CertSetPropertyFlags dwFlags, SafeNCryptKeyHandle pvData);

internal enum CertContextPropId : int
{
    CERT_NCRYPT_KEY_HANDLE_PROP_ID = 78,
}

[Flags]
internal enum CertSetPropertyFlags : int
{
    None = 0,
}

private static X509Certificate2 MateECDsaPrivateKey(
    X509Certificate2 cert,
    CngKey privateKey)
{
    // Make a new certificate instance which isn't tied to the current one
    using (var tmpCert = new X509Certificate2(cert.RawData))
    {
        SafeNCryptKeyHandle keyHandle = privateKey.Handle;

        // Set the ephemeral key handle property
        if (!CertSetCertificateContextProperty(
            tmpCert.Handle,
            CertContextPropId.CERT_NCRYPT_KEY_HANDLE_PROP_ID,
            CertSetPropertyFlags.None,
            keyHandle))
        {
            throw new CryptographicException(Marshal.GetLastWin32Error());
        }

        // You could emit this, if you prefer.
        byte[] pfxBytes = tmpCert.Export(X509ContentType.Pkcs12);

        // Clear the key handle out again to prevent double-free
        keyHandle = new SafeNCryptKeyHandle();

        if (!CertSetCertificateContextProperty(
            tmpCert.Handle,
            CertContextPropId.CERT_NCRYPT_KEY_HANDLE_PROP_ID,
            CertSetPropertyFlags.None,
            keyHandle))
        {
            throw new CryptographicException(Marshal.GetLastWin32Error());
        }

        // Now load a new certificate which has a temporary keyfile on disk.
        // Note: If you don't want exportability here, don't request it.
        var matedCert = new X509Certificate2(pfxBytes, (string)null, X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable);

        using (ECDsa ecdsa = matedCert.GetECDsaPrivateKey())
        {
            if (ecdsa == null)
            {
                throw new InvalidOperationException(""It didn't work"");
            }
        }

        return matedCert;
    }
}

You'll need .NET 4.6.1 (or newer) to have access to GetECDsaPrivateKey().

"22293864","Ruby/openssl: convert Elliptic Curve point octet string into OpenSSL::PKey::EC::Point","I am trying to write Ruby code to check the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signature on a particular message that I found here.
The problem is that I don't know how to convert the octet string for the public key into an OpenSSL::PKey::EC::Point object.  If I were writing this in C, I would just pass the octet string to OpenSSL's o2i_ECPublicKey, which does something close to what I would want and in fact is used by the reference implementation.  However, I searched the source code of Ruby (MRI) and it contains no calls to o2i_ECPublicKey so I don't know how I would use that function from Ruby without writing a C extension.
Here is the octet string, in hex.  It is just a 0x04 byte followed by two 32-byte integers that represent the x and y coordinates of the point on the elliptic curve:
04fc9702847840aaf195de8442ebecedf5b095cdbb9bc716bda9110971b28a49e0ead8564ff0db22209e0374782c093bb899692d524e9d6a6956e7c5ecbcd68284

So does anyone know how to convert that string into an in OpenSSL::PKey::EC::Point in Ruby?  Once I get the point object, I will use it in the following code which I believe will verify the signature:
key = OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new('secp256k1')

I think it's weird that OpenSSL makes you represent the public key temporarily as a single BN (big number), because it is actually two big numbers.  My gem can directly convert octet strings (as defined in the SEC2 standard) into ECDSA::Point objects.
","OpenSSL allows you to create a point with a group and a bignum, so I tried this:
require 'openssl'
include OpenSSL
group = PKey::EC::Group.new('secp256k1')
bignum = BN.new('04fc9702847840...')
point = PKey::EC::Point.new(group, bignum)

But it raises OpenSSL::PKey::EC::Point::Error: invalid encoding.  I'm not quite sure how to troubleshoot it from here, but hopefully this helps you out a little bit.

"22293864","Ruby/openssl: convert Elliptic Curve point octet string into OpenSSL::PKey::EC::Point","I am trying to write Ruby code to check the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signature on a particular message that I found here.
The problem is that I don't know how to convert the octet string for the public key into an OpenSSL::PKey::EC::Point object.  If I were writing this in C, I would just pass the octet string to OpenSSL's o2i_ECPublicKey, which does something close to what I would want and in fact is used by the reference implementation.  However, I searched the source code of Ruby (MRI) and it contains no calls to o2i_ECPublicKey so I don't know how I would use that function from Ruby without writing a C extension.
Here is the octet string, in hex.  It is just a 0x04 byte followed by two 32-byte integers that represent the x and y coordinates of the point on the elliptic curve:
04fc9702847840aaf195de8442ebecedf5b095cdbb9bc716bda9110971b28a49e0ead8564ff0db22209e0374782c093bb899692d524e9d6a6956e7c5ecbcd68284

So does anyone know how to convert that string into an in OpenSSL::PKey::EC::Point in Ruby?  Once I get the point object, I will use it in the following code which I believe will verify the signature:
key = OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new('secp256k1')
key.public_key = point

My questions is:

Which is the equivalent curve name in C# mentioned above?
Could somebody make me an example about how, in C#, i can generate a keyPair like the above java code?

Thanks in advance
","I've found something about my first question:

Which is the equivalent curve name in C# mentioned above?

The microsoft libraries support only P-256, P-384 and P-521 ""NIST-recommended elliptic curve ID"", that is the equivalent named curve, rispectively, secp256r1, secp384r1, secp521r1 of ""SEC 2 recommended elliptic curve domain parameters"" that are the equivalent of prime256v1, but not 384 and 521 in ANSI X9.62 ECDSA prime curve ID.
Bouncy castle libraries for C#, support more other curves like the secp224k1 that i was interested.
For the second question 

Could somebody make me an example about how, in C#, i can generate a keyPair like the above java code?

i've found an old example here
It says that the keys supported are only 3: 192 bit, 239 bit and 256 bit, but i think is referred to some old version of the library
this code can demonstrate it
ECKeyPairGenerator gen = new ECKeyPairGenerator(""ECDSA"");
        SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
        Org.BouncyCastle.Asn1.X9.X9ECParameters ecp = Org.BouncyCastle.Asn1.Sec.SecNamedCurves.GetByName(""secp224k1"");
        ECDomainParameters ecSpec = new ECDomainParameters(ecp.Curve, ecp.G, ecp.N, ecp.H, ecp.GetSeed());
        ECKeyGenerationParameters ecgp = new ECKeyGenerationParameters(ecSpec, secureRandom);
        gen.Init(ecgp);
        AsymmetricCipherKeyPair eckp = gen.GenerateKeyPair();

I reinstalled Windows, but I missed a few things during backup
I forgot the password to my bitcoin address

So basically the wallet.dat is gone, and all I remember of the password are the first two letters and that it was 10 letters long (alphanumeric), generated by random.org.  This was a ""brain wallet"", so the sha256 hash of the password is the private key.  This leaves me with 218 trillion possibilities (62^8).  I've written a C# program that runs through all possible permutations and generates the address to check against.  With 4 cores, this will take tens of thousands of years.  I don't have access to a supercomputer so I was hoping to move to the GPU.
If this was just a simple sha256 hash, my two GPUs could crack this in less than 5 days.  However, the bitcoin security has multiple hashes and ECDSA, which is the slow part.  The Vanitygen program is able to use OpenSSL and OpenCL to run 25 million ECDSA keys/sec with just one of my GPUs, so moving to GPU should speed this up.  
I know what I need to do, but unfortunately, I don't know C++, OpenCL or OpenSSL.  As far as my research has shown, there is no good way to do this in C#, which is my language of choice.  Does anyone have any suggestions (other than forget it, which I'll probably have to do)?

We're currently implementing our iOS app and our Android app will kick-off development in the next month or so. So, my question is as follows:
I know on iOS I can use Certificate, Key and Trust Services to generate a key pair of type kSecAttrKeyTypeECDSA. This is cool.
And I see that the go to encryption library for Android, BouncyCastle, also supports ECDSA. 
So, my question is.. can I count on key-pairs generated on either platform to operate the same in terms of encryption and decryption on both iOS and Android?
i.e. 
iOS User A 

generated their public/private key pair using iOS ECDSA
holds reference to user B's public key

Android User B

generated their public/private key pair using BouncyCastle ECDSA
holds reference to user A's public key

Can user B encode a message using user A's public key.. send the encoded data to user A and expect user A to be able to decode? 
","No, because ECDSA is only used to generate signatures - for instance to authenticate. ECIES should however be available using Bouncy Castle on Android and through CryptoPP on iOS. It's also possible to use ECDH with separate authentication or static-static ECDH but that might require a bit of a learning curve.
Note that ECIES introduces additional overhead, so don't forget to put that into your calculations...

I can retrieve them by thumbprint, but the crypto providers for the private and public keys throw ""Algorithm not supported"" exceptions.  Instead, I understand I'm supposed to use ECDsaCng and ECDiffieHellmanCng to sign/encrypt.  But these deal in CngKey's.
Bouncy Castle isn't an option because it requires the private keys to be exportable.
CLR Security will return me a CngKey pair via GetCngPrivateKey but it cannot be used with ECDsa because the key returned by CLRSecurity is an ECDH key.  Furthermore CLR Security doesn't give me a way to get just the public key from an X509Certificate2 for signature verification (where I don't even have or need the private key of the signer).
Any ideas?  I'm at my wits end...  Any help would be much appreciated.
","You need to create the CngKey from the public key of the certificate:

certificate.PublicKey.EncodedKeyValue.RawData

The CngKey contains 8 additional bytes, the first 4 bytes are used for the name of the curve used (ECS1, ECS3 or ECS5), the last 4 are the length of the key incl. padding (32, 48 or 66).
The first byte of the public key from the certificate is removed (as it is always 0x04 for ECDSA public key). 
So for instance for ECDSA using P-256 curve and SHA-256 hash algorithm, you will get a public key of length 65 bytes. Discard the first byte, leaving 64 bytes, then prefix with 4 bytes for curve and 4 bytes for key length i.e. (Encoding.ASCII):

69 (E) 
67 (C) 
83 (S) 
49 (1) 
32 (Key length)
0 
0 
0

Now you have the public key (72 bytes) to create the CngKey from:

var cngKey = CngKey.Import([the byte array], CngKeyBlobFormat.EccPublicBlob);
var ecdsaCng = new ECDsaCng(cngKey);

And you can verify the signature:

return ecdsaCng.VerifyData(encodedBytes, signature);

"37720783","Create and verify signature in code and from the command line using ECDSA","Problem:
Using the written demo code (given below) I can create and verify without problems.
However, using the openssl command line tool, verifying a signature (created by the demo code)
always seems to fail.
What I have done:
The demo code creates a defined public/private key pair, then signs a defined hash and verifies it.
This is the program output:
Public key: 04DFEC134530603832A31F8885EF01888884483D611F87A698213F168534EC06D85D21F7C85795435BC9A7F78190126CC6E52E050CBDFD43E27175FB1DF3E3DEF6 
Hash: 000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f
Verified EC Signature

S: 608F4BAB9DFE6DC8F976C32D72508CD5BD68F9E325ADED69A9883CE487E6698B

It as well outputs the follwing files:

privkey.pem (private key in PEM format)
pubkey.pem (public Key in PEM format)
data.bin (the hash, nothing fancy)
data_sig.der (the DER encoded signature: R & S value)

All files seem to be created correctly.
Next, I try to verify data_sig.der with the openssl command line tool.
$ openssl dgst -verify pubkey.pem -signature data_sig.der data.bin
Verification Failure

Why does this fail? 
I can only assume, that one of the 4 files has been written incorrectly,
but I double-checked everything and cannot spot my error.
Furthermore, using the PEM files created by the demo program, 
sign & verify works fine from the command line: 
$openssl dgst -sign privkey.pem data.bin > data_sig2.der
$openssl dgst -verify pubkey.pem -signature data_sig2.der data.bin

openssl req -new -nodes -key server\server.key.pem -outform pem -out server\server.csr -sha256

openssl req -new -key CA\private\ca.key.pem -x509 -nodes -days 365 -outform pem -sha256 -out CA\ca.cert.pem

    return null;
}

Remark: I only succeed to load the server certificate into the keystore using BouncyCastle. Otherwise I get ""Only named ECParameters supported"" Error.
3) Setting up the client
The client is set up likewise, except that the server certificate is imported into the truststore.
    SSLContext sslContext = getSSLContextForSMGW();
    SSLSocketFactory sf = sslContext.getSocketFactory();

    SSLSocket clientSocket = (SSLSocket) sf.createSocket(host, port);
    String[] ciphers = {""TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256""};
    clientSocket.setEnabledCipherSuites(ciphers);
    clientSocket.setEnabledProtocols(new String[] {""TLSv1.2""});
    printClientSocketInfo(clientSocket);
    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
    BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream()));

String line = null;
while (((line = in.readLine()) != null)) {
  System.out.println(line);
  break;
}

Now, when the client connects to the server I get the following error stack:
Caused by: java.io.IOException: Only named ECParameters supported
at sun.security.ec.ECParameters.engineInit(ECParameters.java:150)
at java.security.AlgorithmParameters.init(AlgorithmParameters.java:293)

at sun.security.x509.X509CertInfo.<init>(X509CertInfo.java:167)
... 15 more

I guess, that the client is not capable to verify the servers certificate (same error as if I import the certificate not using BouncyCastle). 
I have printed the named EC-Curves with
        System.out.println(""Named EC-Curves:"");
    String[] curves = Security.getProvider(""SunEC"")
            .getProperty(""AlgorithmParameters.EC SupportedCurves"")
            .split(""\\|"");
    for (String curve : curves) {
        System.out.println(curve.substring(1, curve.indexOf("","")));
    }

And it clearly outputs the name 'secp256k1' among them. So what am I missing here? Or how can I make the SSLContext to use another implementation of CertificateX509Key?

I want to know how can I write and load the keys to a PEM file? Does openssl have an existing function to do so?

Yes, OpenSSL has existing functions. For ASN.1/DER, use d2i_ECPrivateKey and d2i_EC_PUBKEY; and for PEM use PEM_read_ECPrivateKey and PEM_read_EC_PUBKEY. The write functions are similar and documented in the man pages.
d2i_* is ""DER to internal"", and its used to read ASN.1/DER keys. The write functions use i2d_* and its ""internal to DER"". PEM does not use a cryptic prefix.
For an example of using d2i_* and PEM_* with RSA keys in a C++ program with the output, see Use OpenSSL RSA key with .Net. You can just swap-in your EC functions in place of the RSA ones.

EC_KEY * generate_eckey() {
    EC_KEY *eckey=EC_KEY_new();

    return eckey;
}

Related, when you write your EC keys, be sure to use a named curve by callingEC_KEY_set_asn1_flag(ecKey, OPENSSL_EC_NAMED_CURVE). If you don't then the keys could be of limited use. Also see Elliptic Curve Cryptography | Named Curves on the OpenSSL wiki.
Also, you are ignoring return values from functions like EC_KEY_new and EC_KEY_generate_key. You might want to rethink that strategy since those function can fail for non-obvious reasons, like a policy setting. Also see EC_KEY_new man pages.

While consuming APN (Apple push notifications) API, i implemented tokenized authorization. It's apple's new way of authorization on their push notifications api. 
Apple provides me private key, which i use to create c# CngKey object, which then i use to sign data.
    CngKey key = CngKey.Import(
       Convert.FromBase64String(privateKey),
       CngKeyBlobFormat.Pkcs8PrivateBlob);

using (ECDsaCng dsa = new ECDsaCng(key))

The result is signed token, which i then use as authorization header while consuming API and sending push notifications. 
It works well on my dev machine, but when i deploy it to Windows Server, when this code runs i get next:

","This is fixed in the .NET Framework 4.6.2, so the easiest solution would perhaps be to get the server upgraded.
A workaround that works for NIST P-256, NIST P-384, and NIST P-521 is to change the dwMagic value in the blob export.  (It won't work for the Windows 10 Generic ECC, because the dwMagic values aren't aligned the same way).
byte[] blob = key.Export(CngKeyBlobFormat.EccPrivateBlob);
key.Dispose();

The first 4 bytes of this blob map to the dwMagic value in the BCRYPT_ECCKEY_BLOB structure.
BCRYPT_ECDH_PRIVATE_P256_MAGIC has value 0x324B4345, which is the Little-Endian representation of ""ECK2"" (Elliptic Curve Key-exchange 2).  BCRYPT_ECDSA_PRIVATE_P256_MAGIC has value 0x32534345, which is the Little-Endian representation of ""ECS2"" (Elliptic Curve Signing 2).
// Change it from Key-exchange (ECDH) to Signing (ECDSA)
blob[1] = 0x53;

key = CngKey.Import(blob, CngKeyBlobFormat.EccPrivateBlob);

And now it sees that it's an ECDSA key, and everything is happy.

BN_bin2bn(&x_compressed_byte_array[0],sizeof(x_compressed_byte_array),x_compressed);

After you set_compressed_coordinates, you can verify if the point you just created locate correctly in the group.

Just remember to new/free BIGNUM x and y at the first/end of your function.

PrivateKey privateKey = getPrivateKeyFromECBigIntAndCurve(priv, ""secp256r1"");
System.out.println(privateKey);

And print it:

DLLTest.exe: Microsoft C++ exception: CryptoPP::BERDecodeErr ...

You have a private exponent, and not a private key. So you should not call Load on it. That's causing the Crypto++ BERDecodeErr exception.
The answer is detailed on the ECDSA wiki page, but its not readily apparent. You need to perform the following to initialize the privateKey given the curve and exponent::
string exp = ""E4A6CFB431471CFCAE491FD566D19C87082CF9FA7722D7FA24B2B3F5669DBEFB"";
exp.insert(0, ""0x"");

Integer x(exp.c_str());
privateKey.Initialize(ASN1::secp256r1(), x);

Prepending the ""0x"" ensures the Integer class will parse the ASCII string correctly. You can also append a ""h"" character to the string. You can see the parsing code for Integer class at Integer.cpp around line 2960 in the StringToInteger function.

Here's another way to do the same thing:
string exp = ""E4A6CFB431471CFCAE491FD566D19C87082CF9FA7722D7FA24B2B3F5669DBEFB"";

HexDecoder decoder;
decoder.Put((byte*)exp.data(), exp.size());
decoder.MessageEnd();

Integer x;
x.Decode(decoder, decoder.MaxRetrievable());

privateKey.Initialize(ASN1::secp256r1(), x);

The HexDecoder will perform the ASCII to binary conversion for you. The buffer held by the HexDecoder will then be consumed by the Integer using its Decode (BufferedTransformation &bt, size_t inputLen, Signedness=UNSIGNED) method.

And here is another way using HexDecoder (Crypto++ is as bad as scripting languages at times :)...
string exp = ""E4A6CFB431471CFCAE491FD566D19C87082CF9FA7722D7FA24B2B3F5669DBEFB"";
StringSource ss(exp, true /*punpAll*/, new HexDecoder);

Integer x;
x.Decode(ss, ss.MaxRetrievable());

privateKey.Initialize(ASN1::secp256r1(), x);


After initializing the key, you should validate it:
bool result = privateKey.Validate( prng, 3 );
if( !result ) { /* Handle error */ }


This will output binary data:
cout << signature.data() << endl;

If you want something printable/readable, run it though a Crypto++ HexEncoder.

","Your public key is 52 bytes long - it is too short. How are you generating it?
The ToPublicKeyFromBlob() method is a shortcut for return CngKey.Import(byteArray, CngKeyBlobFormat.EccPublicBlob) - it works only on Ecc-based keys, and those generated by .NET. Inferno uses ECC keys over P384 curve, which means that each public key will have 48*2=96 bytes, plus 8 header bytes (as described here), for a total of 104 bytes.

How to verify ECDSA signature with Crypto++ without the verify function?

I'm not sure how you would verify code without a verify function. I'm probably not understanding the question.
Just in case, here's how Crypto++ implements its verification code.
First, ECDSA is a DL_Algorithm_ECDSA (from eccrypto.h):
//! ECDSA algorithm
template <class EC>
class DL_Algorithm_ECDSA : public DL_Algorithm_GDSA<typename EC::Point>
{
public:
    static const char * CRYPTOPP_API StaticAlgorithmName() {return ""ECDSA"";}
};
...

template <class EC, class H>
struct ECDSA :
    public DL_SS<DL_Keys_ECDSA<EC>, DL_Algorithm_ECDSA<EC>,
               DL_SignatureMessageEncodingMethod_DSA, H>
{
};

Next, here's verify function from DL_Algorithm_GDSA in gfcrypt.h:
bool Verify(const DL_GroupParameters<T> &params, const DL_PublicKey<T> &publicKey,
                const Integer &e, const Integer &r, const Integer &s) const
{
    const Integer &q = params.GetSubgroupOrder();
    if (r>=q || r<1 || s>=q || s<1)
        return false;

    Integer w = s.InverseMod(q);
    Integer u1 = (e * w) % q;
    Integer u2 = (r * w) % q;

    return r == params.ConvertElementToInteger(
                    publicKey.CascadeExponentiateBaseAndPublicElement(u1, u2)) % q;
}


The code below uses VerifyMessage, and its part of PK_Verifier declared in cryptolib.h:
virtual bool VerifyMessage(const byte *message, size_t messageLen, 
                 const byte *signature, size_t signatureLength) const;

PK_Verifier is the 'master' base class that objects like ECDSA, NR, and RSASS use to expose the consistent interface.
Objects like ECDSA, NR, and RSASS connect to PK_Verifier via the DL_SS:
template <class EC, class H>
struct ECDSA :
    public DL_SS<DL_Keys_ECDSA<EC>, DL_Algorithm_ECDSA<EC>, DL_SignatureMessageEncodingMethod_DSA, H>
{
};

Finally, here's how DL_SS relates to PK_Verifier (from pubkey.h):
//! Discrete Log Based Signature Scheme
template <class KEYS, class SA, class MEM, class H, class ALG_INFO = DL_SS<KEYS, SA, MEM, H, int> >
class DL_SS : public KEYS
{
    typedef DL_SignatureSchemeOptions<ALG_INFO, KEYS, SA, MEM, H> SchemeOptions;
    ...

    //! implements PK_Signer interface
    typedef PK_FinalTemplate<DL_SignerImpl<SchemeOptions> > Signer;
    //! implements PK_Verifier interface
    typedef PK_FinalTemplate<DL_VerifierImpl<SchemeOptions> > Verifier;
};



The problem is when I want to check signature it doesn't work with Verify function.

There's lots of code available on the Crypto++ wiki. For ECDSA, see Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. Below is a signing a verification sample taken from the wiki.
Sign
AutoSeededRandomPool prng;

ECDSA<ECP, SHA1>::PrivateKey privateKey;
privateKey.Load(...);
privateKey.Validate(prng, 3);

ECDSA<ECP, SHA1>::Signer signer(privateKey);

string message = ""Do or do not. There is no try."";

// Determine maximum size, allocate a string with the maximum size
size_t siglen = signer.MaxSignatureLength();
string signature(siglen, 0x00);

// Sign, and trim signature to actual size
siglen = signer.SignMessage( prng, message.data(), message.size(), signature.data() );
signature.resize(siglen);

Verify
AutoSeededRandomPool prng;

ECDSA<ECP, SHA1>::PublicKey publicKey;
publicKey.Load(...);
publicKey.Validate(prng, 3);

ECDSA<ECP, SHA1>::Verifier verifier(publicKey);

bool result = verifier.VerifyMessage( message.data(), message.size(), signature.data(), signature.size() );
if(result)
  cout << ""Verified signature on message"" << endl;
else
  cerr << ""Failed to verify signature on message"" << endl;

"15113781","ECDSA Signatures always return false on verification","I have 3 test keys — RSA, DSA and ECDSA. The RSA and DSA key-based signatures return true when verified. But the ECDSA-based signature always returns false (even when the signatures match).
The same code is used to verify all 3 test keys (apart from the differences in the provider object passed to Signature.getInstance()). My code is as follows:
Signature ecdsa = Signature.getInstance(""SHA1withECDSA"");
ecdsa.initSign(pk);
ecdsa.update(rawKeyBytes);
byte[] signatureBytes = ecdsa.sign(); 

Signature ecdsa3 = Signature.getInstance(""SHA1WithECDSA"");
ecdsa3.initVerify(puk);  
ecdsa3.update(rawKeyBytes);
System.out.println(""Verifying: ""+ecdsa3.verify(signatureBytes));

The output of the program is always Verifying: false. When I change the provider to SHA1WithRSA and use an RSA key (using the same code above), the verification returns true, same with DSA-based keys. Someone mentioned it had something to do with the ECPoint passed to the ECPublicKeySpec() constructor, when trying to create a public key from the private key like this:
ECPrivateKey ec = (ECPrivateKey) privateKey;
ECPublicKeySpec ecKeySpec = new ECPublicKeySpec(
    ec.getParams().getGenerator(),

Someone mentioned that signature verification (using the public key) would fail if a different ECPoint was used from the private key. But I actually get the ECPoint from the PrivateKey object (ec). Any solutions, please?

at the following line:
bool valid =  signer.VerifySignature(b_signature);

So, something seems wrong with the signature, but I can not figure out. I hope anybody could help with an good idea.
By the way, the provided data in this example was modified, so the signature would be evaluated to false, if it would work.
","This may be too late to help, but for the benefit of later readers:
A DSA signature is expected to be the ASN.1 encoding of a SEQUENCE containing two INTEGERs. The problem here is that b_signature is actually an OCTET STRING, with the octets inside it being the correct encoding. So there is an extra ""outer"" wrapping around the real signature. You can see this by dumping out the structure:
Asn1OctetString outer =(Asn1OctetString)Asn1Object.FromByteArray(b_signature);
byte[] inner = outer.GetOctets();

Console.WriteLine(Asn1Dump.DumpAsString(outer));
Console.WriteLine(Asn1Dump.DumpAsString(Asn1Object.FromByteArray(inner)));

For me, this prints:

DER Octet String[71]
DER Sequence
      Integer(16446081942964531772961165410855935370418106604815444975891408706004345083361)

So, the 'inner' octets look to be correctly encoded. Now:
bool valid = signer.VerifySignature(inner);

For me, this prints 'false', which you say is expected because the data has been modified.

","PublicKey.Key is unofficially deprecated (along with PrivateKey).  It doesn't support ECC, and doesn't produce an RSA key that is capable of doing OAEP-SHA-2 encryption or DSA key capable of doing FIPS 186-3 DSA.
Instead you want to use the extension methods which don't require casting:
// GetECDsaPublicKey returns a unique object every call,
// so you're responsible for Disposing it (lest it end up on the Finalizer queue)
using (ECDsa ecdsa = msCert2.GetECDsaPublicKey())

ECPublicKey getKeyBC(BigInteger q, String identifier) {
    // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42639620/generate-ecpublickey-from-ecprivatekey
    try {
        // This only works with the Bouncycastle library:

        // http://www.bouncycastle.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=362269#SupportedCurves(ECDSAandECGOST)-NIST(aliasesforSECcurves)
        String name = identifier.replace(""nist"", ""sec"") + ""r1"";
        KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""ECDSA"", ""BC"");
        ECNamedCurveParameterSpec ecSpec = ECNamedCurveTable.getParameterSpec(name);
        ECPoint point = ecSpec.getCurve().decodePoint(q.toByteArray());

Using public key from authorized_keys with Java security, and this discussion of the openssh format for ECDSA: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/129910/ecdsa-why-do-ssh-keygen-and-java-generated-public-keys-have-different-sizes 
However I'm getting lost trying to adapt the RSS/DSA code for ECDSA - I'm not sure how to set up an ECPublicKeySpec. It needs ECPoint, EllipticCurve, ECParameterSpec, ECField. The openssh format only contains two integers, which makes sense for ECPoint, but I don't know how to set up the rest.
I've been poking around a bunch of libraries, including jsch, sshj, ssh-tools and good old Bouncycastle. The closest I have is:
com.jcraft.jsch.KeyPair load = com.jcraft.jsch.KeyPair.load(jsch, null, bytes[openSshKey]);
Which loads the key fine, but doesn't get me to a JCE PublicKey - just a byte[] getPublicKeyBlob() method.
Am I missing something obvious?
","For completeness, here's the code I've gone with. It's nearly-pure JCE, with a sprinkling of Bouncycastle inside helper methods (this updates the example code in Using public key from authorized_keys with Java security):

I tried using the DSACryptoServiceProvider, but it only supports SHA1 or MD5. 
But it seems that ECDsaCng is able to support ECDSA-with-SHA256. The only problem that I have is that I don't know how to convert the Private and Public Key from my X509Certificate2 into the necessary CngKey. I read another question where someone described how to convert the Public Key. But in order to be able to sign data, I need the Private Key, too. 
So is there a way to get the CngKey of the Private and Public Key out of the X509Certificate2? The certificates are available in different formats. I have them as PFX file and separately as CER and PEM files. 
I would prefer to stick with the .NET Framework 4, but if it's not possible at all to use it, I would also switch to Bouncy Castle. 
","Support for this was added in .NET 4.6.1:
private static byte[] SignWithCert(X509Certificate2 cert, byte[] data)

","The error:0906D06C:PEM routines:PEM_read_bio:no start line is non-fatal.  That means it didn't find a certificate along with the private key which is okay since there is only a public/private key in this case.
openssl_verify() returns -1 on failure, 1 if the signature is correct and 0 if it is incorrect.  Because of this you should be checking for all 3 values, not just true or false.
You should check the return value of openssl_verify for -1 indicating failure.  If it returns 0, then the key is valid but either the signature is invalid, the data was tampered with, or the wrong public key was used for verification.

PS I asked a similar question relating to private keys here Creation of ECDSA private key given curve and private exponent?
","The answer is detailed on the ECDSA wiki page, but its not readily apparent. You need to perform the following to initialize the publicKey given the curve and public point:
string pt = ""2DB45A3F21889438B42C8F464C75292BACF5FDDB5DA0B492501B299CBFE92D8F""
            ""DB90FC8FF4026129838B1BCAD1402CAE47FE7D8084E409A41AFCE16D63579C5F"";

HexDecoder decoder;
decoder.Put((byte*)pt.data(), pt.size());
decoder.MessageEnd();

ECP::Point q;
size_t len = decoder.MaxRetrievable();
// len should be GetField().MaxElementByteLength()

q.identity = false;
q.x.Decode(decoder, len/2);
q.y.Decode(decoder, len/2);

ECDSA<ECP, SHA256>::PublicKey publicKey;
publicKey.Initialize(ASN1::secp256r1(), q);

bool result = publicKey.Validate( prng, 3 );
if( result )
{
    cout << ""Validated public key"" << endl;
}
else
{
    cerr << ""Failed to validate public key"" << endl;
    exit(1);
}

const ECP::Point& qq = publicKey.GetPublicElement();
cout << ""Q.x: "" << std::hex << qq.x << endl;
cout << ""Q.y: "" << std::hex << qq.y << endl;

The program above produces the following results.
$ ./cryptopp-test.exe
Validated public key
Q.x: 2db45a3f21889438b42c8f464c75292bacf5fddb5da0b492501b299cbfe92d8fh
Q.y: db90fc8ff4026129838b1bcad1402cae47fe7d8084e409a41afce16d63579c5fh


You can't use GetField().MaxElementByteLength() because the only thing available are the x and y coordinates. Things like field size won't be available until you initialize the underlying DL_GroupParameters_EC< EC > in the public key.
As an example, the following causes a segmentation fault:
ECDSA<ECP, SHA256>::PublicKey publicKey;
unsigned int u = publicKey.GetGroupParameters().GetCurve().GetField().MaxElementByteLength();
cout << ""Field element length: "" << u << endl;


You can tamper with the public key to ensure a validation failure with:
q.y.Decode(decoder, len/2);
q.y++;

this is chopped together so wont build. Any help would be great
PS I asked a similar question relating to private keys here Creation of ECDSA private key given curve and private exponent?
","Here's the answer to your second question on how to use VerifyMessage:
...
publicKey.Initialize(ASN1::secp256r1(), q);

string msg = ""020000000000000001FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFE123456789ABCDEF000B3DA2000000100000300000003030003000300"";
string sig = ""0199E984CEC75DDCA7F1DDF6E53E2E67352A2BE38A4B66F8ED596606FAB983FF300CAA76DE88CED9D563A5C03E8F3A7C000780F3F2061C611E9AA0B18B460D77"";

string mm, ss;

decoder.Detach(new StringSink(mm));
decoder.Put((byte*)msg.data(), msg.size());
decoder.MessageEnd();

decoder.Detach(new StringSink(ss));
decoder.Put((byte*)sig.data(), sig.size());
decoder.MessageEnd();

ECDSA<ECP, SHA256>::Verifier verifier(publicKey);
result = verifier.VerifyMessage((byte*)mm.data(), mm.size(), (byte*)ss.data(), ss.size());

if( result )
{
    cout << ""Verified message"" << endl;
}
else
{ 
    cerr << ""Failed to verify message"" << endl;
    exit(1);
}

Calling Detach on the HexDecoder deletes the current filter, and replaces it with the new filter. In the code above, its the StringSink. You have to do it to ensure memory is not leaked.
Your message does not verify under the public key:
$ ./cryptopp-test.exe
Validated public key
Failed to verify message

You can also try to verify the ASCII message rather than the binary message, but it fails to verify too:
decoder.Attach(new StringSink(mm));
decoder.Put((byte*)msg.data(), msg.size());
decoder.MessageEnd();

// Swap in the ASCII message for the binary message
mm = msg;

So someone gave you the wrong message, the wrong signature or the wrong public key (or some combination).

","You changed that code more than you said because it doesn't have variables 'pk' or 'x'.
Anytime you get an error/failure return from a libcrypto routine you should always look at the error queue; see https://www.openssl.org/docs/faq.html#PROG6 and https://www.openssl.org/docs/faq.html#PROG7 . (For libssl routines you should do so depending on the return from SSL_get_error.) If you do so as in my code below for the 'bad' case, you see X509_sign fails with
140018941793960:error:100C508A:elliptic curve routines:PKEY_EC_CTRL:invalid digest type:ec_pmeth.c:388:

because standard ECDSA signature schemes don't include MD5. You must use SHA1 or SHA2, and you should use a hash matched in strength to the ECC key, which in this case is SHA256. Since the signature failed, the x509 structure does not contain valid data and can't be successfully printed. 
Also note: since 1.0.0 (in 2010) PEM_write_PrivateKey with enc nonnull uses 'new' (ca. 2000!) PKCS#8/PBES2 format, which needs a suitable variant of OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms.

"40552688","Generating a ECDSA Private key in bouncy castle returns a PUBLIC key","I am attempting to use bouncy castle to generate ECDSA keys. The code seems to work fine from the Java perspective; but, when I dump the file and try to validate the data, OpenSSL does not like the format of the data.
After some research, I figured that bouncy castle is encoding the private key as public key.
Here is my Java code:
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());
        System.out.println(""Starting..."");
        String name = ""prime256v1"";
        try {
            KeyPairGenerator kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""ECDSA"", BouncyCastleProvider.PROVIDER_NAME);
            kpg.initialize(new ECGenParameterSpec(name));
            KeyPair keyPair = kpg.generateKeyPair();    
            FileOutputStream writer = new FileOutputStream(""private.key"");
            writer.write(keyPair.getPrivate().getEncoded());
            writer.close();
        } catch(Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

The file private.key is generated in valid DER format; however, when I run the following command to see the ASN.1 structure of the key:
$ openssl asn1parse -inform DER -in /my/path/private.key
    0:d=0  hl=3 l= 147 cons: SEQUENCE          
    3:d=1  hl=2 l=   1 prim: INTEGER           :00
    6:d=1  hl=2 l=  19 cons: SEQUENCE          
    8:d=2  hl=2 l=   7 prim: OBJECT            :id-ecPublicKey
   17:d=2  hl=2 l=   8 prim: OBJECT            :prime256v1
   27:d=1  hl=2 l= 121 prim: OCTET STRING      [HEX DUMP]: <hex data>

For comparison, if I run the following commands to generate a ECDSA key using OpenSSL, I get  the following ASN.1 structure:
 $ openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -outform DER -out private.key
 $ openssl asn1parse -inform DER -in private.key
     0:d=0  hl=2 l= 119 cons: SEQUENCE          
     2:d=1  hl=2 l=   1 prim: INTEGER           :01
     5:d=1  hl=2 l=  32 prim: OCTET STRING      [HEX DUMP]: <hex data>
    39:d=1  hl=2 l=  10 cons: cont [ 0 ]        
    41:d=2  hl=2 l=   8 prim: OBJECT            :prime256v1
    51:d=1  hl=2 l=  68 cons: cont [ 1 ]        
    53:d=2  hl=2 l=  66 prim: BIT STRING        

So, I guess my questions are

Is there anything I am missing?
Or is this a known bug?
Is there anyway to get around it?

","Java outputs key in the encoded format. You should try:

    String hex = Hex.toHexString(publicKeyBytes);

    byte[] data = value.toByteArray();
    int length = Math.min(size, data.length);

CngKey.Import() is throwing ""The parameter is incorrect"" error while trying to generate a CngKey required for the Jose.JWT.Encode function. Not sure what step I am missing. Thanks.
","The ""ECCPUBLICBLOB"" format isn't the same as the ""public key"" field from the certificate.
The format of the ECCPUBLICBLOB is explained in another question's answer, but here's a quick summary:
UINT32 Magic
UINT32 cbKey
<cbKey bytes of public key>

The value for Magic will depend on which curve and algorithm you're trying to import (some hints at https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#system.core/System/Security/Cryptography/BCryptNative.cs,fde0749a0a5f70d8,references).
cbKey is how many bytes are in the public key.
The public key bytes will be a bit different than what you get from GetPublicKey().  It'll be just the curve X coordinate, which will be (for NIST P-256) bytes 1..33  (the first byte of GetPublicKey() will be 0x04, which says that the payload is uncompressed, then 32 bytes of the X coordinate, then 32 bytes of the Y coordinate).
IEnumerable<byte> blobBytes = BitConverter.GetBytes(0x31534345);
blobBytes = blobBytes.Append(BitConverter.GetBytes(32));
blobBytes = blobBytes.Append(cert.GetPublicKey().Skip(1).Take(32));

byte[] eccblob = blobBytes.ToArray();

System.Linq extension methods used for brevity.
Though, if you just need an object instance, cert.GetECDsaPublicKey() should do the right thing for you (each call to that returns a new instance, so manage the lifetime appropriately)

You can see my final solution on the following post
Public key needs to be modified by discarding the first byte, leaving 64 bytes, then prefix with 4 bytes for curve and 4 bytes for key length. Here is the complete solution:
var payload = new Dictionary<string, object>()
{
   { ""sub"", ""mr.x@contoso.com"" },
   { ""exp"", 1300819380     }
};
var certificate = X509Certificate.CreateFromCertFile(""public.cer"");
byte[] publicKey = certificate.GetPublicKey(); //public key has 65 bytes

//Discard the first byte (it is always 0X04 for ECDSA public key)
publicKey = publicKey.Skip(1).ToArray();:

//Generate 4 bytes for curve and 4 bytes for key length [ 69(E), 67(C), 83(S), 49(1), 32(Key length), 0, 0, 0 ]
byte[] x = { 69, 67, 83, 49, 32, 0, 0, 0 };    

//Prefix above generated array to existing public key array
publicKey = x.Concat(publicKey).ToArray();

var cng = CngKey.Import(publicKey, CngKeyBlobFormat.EccPublicBlob); //This works

        System.out.println(""valid certificate generated"");

        //Another test: (verify not using cert.verify but rather calculating the signature)
        Signature verifier = Signature.getInstance(""SHA384WITHECDSA"", ""SC"");
        boolean result=false;
        verifier.initVerify(x509cert.getPublicKey()); // This cert is self-signed
        verifier.update(x509cert.getTBSCertificate());  //TBS is to get the ""To Be Signed"" part of the certificate - .getEncoded() gets the whole cert, which includes the signature
        result = verifier.verify(x509cert.getSignature());
        if (result == false)
        {
            System.out.println(""signature validation failed"");
        }
        //end of another verification
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        //
    }
    return derCert;
} //GenerateMyClientCertificate

In the same way, I can check the CA certificate, which is also a self-signed certificate:
//Certificate validity test using verify: -- This seems to work well for self-signed certificates...
        RootCaX509Cert.checkValidity(new Date());
        RootCaX509Cert.verify(RootCaX509Cert.getPublicKey(), ""SC"");  //This cert is self-signed...
        System.out.println(""valid certificate generated"");

        //Another test: (verify not using cert.verify but rather calculating the signature)
        Signature verifier = Signature.getInstance(""SHA384WITHECDSA"", ""SC"");
        boolean result=false;
        verifier.initVerify(RootCaX509Cert.getPublicKey()); // This cert is self-signed
        verifier.update(RootCaX509Cert.getTBSCertificate());  //TBS is to get the ""To Be Signed"" part of the certificate - .getEncoded() gets the whole cert, which includes the signature
        result = verifier.verify(RootCaX509Cert.getSignature());
        if (result == false)
        {
            System.out.println(""signature validation failed"");
        }

Now I want to check the User certificate, using the public key of the CA certificate.  But neither of the above verify methods work:
        //Certificate validity test using verify: -- This seems to work well for self-signed certificates...
        ServerX509Cert.checkValidity(new Date());
        ServerX509Cert.verify(RootCaX509Cert.getPublicKey(), ""SC"");  //This cert was signed by CA
        System.out.println(""valid certificate generated"");

        //Another test: (verify not using cert.verify but rather calculating the signature)
        Signature verifier = Signature.getInstance(""SHA384WITHECDSA"", ""SC"");
        boolean result=false;
        verifier.initVerify(RootCaX509Cert.getPublicKey()); // This cert is signed by CA
        verifier.update(ServerX509Cert.getTBSCertificate());  //TBS is to get the ""To Be Signed"" part of the certificate - .getEncoded() gets the whole cert, which includes the signature
        result = verifier.verify(ServerX509Cert.getSignature());
        if (result == false)
        {
            System.out.println(""signature validation failed"");
        }

So currently I can only check self-signed certificates :( 
I would have thought that using RootCaX509Cert.getPublicKey() as the key here would have worked, but it does not.  Maybe I misunderstand how this CA signature verification should be done?

"20205728","Hex encode ECDSA keys in node.js","I'm building a nodejs app that talks to an API server. The API server requires that each request I make to it includes a X-Signature header using the prime256v1 ECDSA curve and sha256 hash on a particular set of data. 
I looked through the crypto and tls documentation but didn't find anything suitable. I have successfully generated a private key with openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey but it is in PEM format. I have also generated a DER format key. Both of these include some extra metadata like the curve used and in the case of PEM, comments. 
I can use these keys for signing operations on my side, but the server requires that I upload a public key using hex encoding (so the server can verify the signatures I make on my requests.)
Specifically the server wants something like the output of the following Python code:
from ecdsa import SigningKey
from binascii import hexlify
hexlify(SigningKey.from_pem(content).to_string())

Sample output for a pubkey (no newlines): c5bd76cd0cd948de17a31261567d219576e992d9066fe1a6bca97496dec634e2c8e06f8949773b300b9f73fabbbc7710d5d6691e96bcf3c9145e15daf6fe07b9
I would prefer not adding python as a dependency to my node app... anyone know of a way I can extract the binary data representing my private key from the PEM or DER files, so I can put it in a buffer and call buffer.toString('hex')? Or a way I can use the native crypto library to generate the ECDSA keypair? Or a library that would do the same?
","openssl itself can print out the guts of things, in hex.
Doe the key change? sounds like you can just decode into hex one time, and use that?  No need for dependencies - just paste the hex into your node source?

... why when I use the java code, the signature is not verified?

OpenSSL and Java use an ASN.1/DER encoding for the signature, and Crypto++ uses IEEE P1363's format for the signature.

ASN.1: SEQUENCE ::= { r INTEGER, s INTEGER }
P1363: [byte array r][byte array s]

You need to convert between the formats. Crypto++ provides DSAConvertSignatureFormat to convert between formats. There is an example on the Crypto++ wiki at Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm | OpenSSL and Java Interop.
Here is the Crypto++ code from the wiki. It uses OpenSSL and its command line tools rather than Java. There is no material difference because OpenSSL and Java output signatures in ASN.1/DER format.

","By the way, another way around your problem (especially allowing you to avoid the command line) would be to modify the Java code in order to have a way to produce the R and S values, as well as to reproduce the DER encoded values.
For example you can extract the R and S values from the Java signature using those:
public static BigInteger extractR(byte[] signature) throws Exception {
    int startR = (signature[1] & 0x80) != 0 ? 3 : 2;
    int lengthR = signature[startR + 1];
    return new BigInteger(Arrays.copyOfRange(signature, startR + 2, startR + 2 + lengthR));
}

public static BigInteger extractS(byte[] signature) throws Exception {
    int startR = (signature[1] & 0x80) != 0 ? 3 : 2;
    int lengthR = signature[startR + 1];
    int startS = startR + 2 + lengthR;
    int lengthS = signature[startS + 1];
    return new BigInteger(Arrays.copyOfRange(signature, startS + 2, startS + 2 + lengthS));
}

These methods are notably used in Wycheproof to play around with the BigIntegers directly.
These can allow you to reconstruct the P1363 encoding used by CryptoPP in Java, but be careful not to forget the left padding with 0s of the bytearrays. (Otherwise you may have problems when the R or S bytearray is smaller than the expected length.)
And you can also reconstruct the DER encoded signature from big integers using:
public static byte[] derSign(BigInteger r, BigInteger s) throws Exception {
    byte[] rb = r.toByteArray();
    byte[] sb = s.toByteArray();
    int off = (2 + 2) + rb.length;
    int tot = off + (2 - 2) + sb.length;
    byte[] der = new byte[tot + 2];
    der[0] = 0x30;
    der[1] = (byte) (tot & 0xff);
    der[2 + 0] = 0x02;
    der[2 + 1] = (byte) (rb.length & 0xff);
    System.arraycopy(rb, 0, der, 2 + 2, rb.length);
    der[off + 0] = 0x02;
    der[off + 1] = (byte) (sb.length & 0xff);
    System.arraycopy(sb, 0, der, off + 2, sb.length);
    return der;
}

As you can see, these methods might be translated into C++ code, since they are really basic byte manipulations, but that's another story ;)

When using C libraries like this I often define a custom smart pointer to take care if the deletions. This makes the code less prone to memory leaks and ""exception safe"".
For example I would define something like this:
struct ec_key_dter{void operator()(EC_KEY* k)const{if(k) EC_KEY_free(k);}};
using  ec_key_uptr = std::unique_ptr<EC_KEY, ec_key_dter>;

if(!EC_KEY_generate_key(key.get()))

The PushManager subscribe method takes a VAPID key (public key alone) as a parameter and will give a subscription end point and keys to push messages.
To generate VAPID keys, I have been using node.js (google web-push package) and openssl till now. But in my use case VAPID keys should be generated within Java and passed to JavaScript to subscribe from the browser. 
I am trying with the code below in Java to generate VAPID keys. I am able to create keys successfully but when I pass the generated public key (base64-encoded string), the subscribe method returns an error saying:

","Please refer below link for answer from MartijnDwars.
https://github.com/web-push-libs/webpush-java/issues/30

you can use Utils.savePublicKey to convert your Java-generated
  PublicKey to a byte[]. This byte[] is then passed to the
  PushManager.subscribe method.
It may be more convenient to base64 encode the byte[] in Java and
  base64 decode the string in JavaScript. For example, after generating
  the keypair in Java:
KeyPair keyPair = generateKeyPair();
byte[] publicKey = Utils.savePublicKey((ECPublicKey) keyPair.getPublic());
String publicKeyBase64 = BaseEncoding.base64Url().encode(publicKey);
System.out.println(""PublicKey = "" + publicKeyBase64);
// PublicKey = BPf36QAqZNNvvnl9kkpTDerXUOt6Nm6P4x9GEvmFVFKgVyCVWy24KUTs6wLQtbV2Ug81utbNnx86_vZzXDyrl88=

Then in JavaScript:
function subscribe() {
    const publicKey = base64UrlToUint8Array('BPf36QAqZNNvvnl9kkpTDerXUOt6Nm6P4x9GEvmFVFKgVyCVWy24KUTs6wLQtbV2Ug81utbNnx86_vZzXDyrl88=');

    navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(function (serviceWorkerRegistration) {
        serviceWorkerRegistration.pushManager.subscribe({
            userVisibleOnly: true,
            applicationServerKey: publicKey
        })
        .then(function (subscription) {

                console.error('Unable to subscribe to push.', e);

How to Construct ECDSA publicKey using only with x value (Point compression)?

x is the private exponent. The public key is a point on the curve; and it does not use the private exponent.
To get the public key: take the private exponent, and raise your base point to it. That is, Q = G^x.
If you want to set the private exponent on a private key or decryptor, then set the domain parameters (i.e., DL_GroupParameters_EC< ECP > or DL_GroupParameters_EC< EC2M >) and then call SetPrivateExponent(x);.

Have you reviewed your previous question at How can I recover compressed y value from sender?? The community took the time to provide you with an answer and sample code, but you did not acknowledge or follow up.
I think owlstead said it best here: 

Why would we care answer you if you are not inclined to accept answers
  or even follow up to them? Your questions are all right, but the way
  you treat the community is terrible.

I need to send to this public key to an api call which validates whether the key is valid or not. The key generated by openssl when sent with the api call is accepted by the server as valid.
But the public ecdsa key generated in java when sent with the api call is rejected. I'm using following code to generate keypair
public KeyPair getECDSAKeyPair() throws NoSuchProviderException, NoSuchAlgorithmException,
        InvalidAlgorithmParameterException {
    KeyPairGenerator keyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""ECDSA"", ""SC"");
    ECGenParameterSpec spec = new ECGenParameterSpec(""secp256k1"");

}

public String getHexPublicKeyString(KeyPair keypair) {
    PublicKey publicKey =  keypair.getPublic();
    return Hex.toHexString(publicKey.getEncoded());
}

My question is how can I generate same type of ECDSA keypair as generated by the OpenSSL? And what is the difference between the keys generated by OpenSSL and the code generated by java such that key generated by OpenSSL is accepted whereas key generated by java is rejected?

How to get combined SecretKey from PrivateKey and PublicKey which are generated using ECDSA algorithm?
","A key agreement protocol usually works between two parties each of them having an own ECDS public and private key (hence we have four different keys). Are you sure that is what you want?
Therefore when you agree to a key you need the private key of party A and the public key of party B. And on the other end of the connection you use the private key of party B and the public key of party A.
The ECDH key agreement algorithm you selected is described in RFC3278 - for details read it.

","I think you need to construct ECDSA-Sig-Value structure and fill it with the data from your signedHash variable.
PKCS#11 v2.20 chapter 12.3.1:

For the purposes of these mechanisms, an ECDSA signature is an octet
  string of even length which is at most two times nLen octets, where
  nLen is the length in octets of the base point order n. The signature
  octets correspond to the concatenation of the ECDSA values r and s,
  both represented as an octet string of equal length of at most nLen
  with the most significant byte first. If r and s have different octet
  length, the shorter of both must be padded with leading zero octets
  such that both have the same octet length. Loosely spoken, the first
  half of the signature is r and the second half is s. For signatures
  created by a token, the resulting signature is always of length 2nLen.
  For signatures passed to a token for verification, the signature may
  have a shorter length but must be composed as specified before.

RFC5753 chapter 7.2:

When using ECDSA with SignedData, ECDSA signatures are encoded using
  the type:
ECDSA-Sig-Value ::= SEQUENCE {
    r INTEGER,
    s INTEGER }

ECDSA-Sig-Value is specified in [PKI-ALG].  Within CMS,
  ECDSA-Sig-Value is DER-encoded and placed within a signature field of
  SignedData.

Following method uses BouncyCastle library to constructs DER-encoded ECDSA-Sig-Value structure:
public static byte[] ConstructEcdsaSigValue(byte[] rs)
{
    if (rs == null)
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(rs));

    if (rs.Length < 2 || rs.Length % 2 != 0)
        throw new ArgumentException(""Invalid length"", nameof(rs));

    int halfLen = rs.Length / 2;

    byte[] half1 = new byte[halfLen];
    Array.Copy(rs, 0, half1, 0, halfLen);
    var r = new Org.BouncyCastle.Math.BigInteger(1, half1);

    byte[] half2 = new byte[halfLen];
    Array.Copy(rs, halfLen, half2, 0, halfLen);

Is there a way to understand the 64-bytes signature generated so that I can map the signature blob contents to (r,s) pair in linux and verify it?

The r and s are in P1363 format, which is simply a concatenation of r and s in a 2's compliment format. That is, the signature is simply r || s.
You need to know the hash to use this format. For example, SHA1 will create a r of 20 bytes and an s of 20 bytes. If r or s is ""too short"", then it is padded on the left with 0's.
Java and OpenPGP are different than P1363. Java and OpenPGP use an ASN.1 encoding:
SEQUENCE ::= {
  r INTEGER,
  s INTEGER
}

Depending what library you use on Linux, you may have to convert between the formats. Cryptographic Interoperability: Digital Signatures gives examples of signing and verifying using a few different libraries.


Or is there a simpler way to verify the generated signature in linux?

Try Crypto++. I believe Microsoft and Crypto++ uses the same signature format, so you won't need to convert. See Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm for details.

Compute the ECDSA signature of this message with your private key.


Before getting to this point, I generated my certificate, a .pem file, which when opening it in a text editor shows me my private key, so I have that in string format too.
I've also followed the steps for generating what it refers to as a message, which I now have as a string.
So given that I have a private key, (or the .pem file if required), and a message as a string, it should in theory be fairly simple for me to get a ECDSA signature of the message, computed with my private key. But here's where I'm struggling. Libraries that I've found online seem to take a far more complicated approach, with different moving parts, no reference to a .pem file and talk of generating new public/private keys.
Any help with this step would be greatly appreciated.
","It appears that the documentation and the actual API for Ruby’s OpenSSL EC support are both currently rather lacking. In particular, in Ruby <= 2.3.1 the OpenSSL::PKey::EC doesn’t follow the same API as RSA and DSA keys for signing and verifying. What you would want to do, but currently can’t with EC keys, is this (all the code here assumes you have called require 'openssl' somewhere):
# Get the key, here I'm reading the file
priv_key = OpenSSL::PKey.read(File.read('eckey.pem')) 

# This should be the appropriately formatted string
data = ""some data to sign""

# The hash algorithm, I assume SHA256 is being used
digest = OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256.new

# This doesn't work in 2.3.1, but does in 2.4.0-preview1
signature = priv_key.sign(digest, data)

As I note in the comments, this does work in Ruby 2.4.0-preview1, but that’s likely not much use to you.
To get it working with current Ruby, you need to do something like this:
# As before:
priv_key = OpenSSL::PKey.read(File.read('eckey.pem'))
data = ""some data to sign""

signature = priv_key.dsa_sign_asn1(OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256.digest(data))

Both these techniques give you a binary string. I think you will need to base64 encode it before adding it as your request header.
To extract the public key to check the signature verifies is also a bit tricky (although you could just use the openssl command line and read in the file). The public_key methods returns an OpenSSL::PKey::EC::Point object rather than an actual key, so we need to recreate one from the private key. The verify method does work on Ruby 2.3.1:
pub = OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new(priv_key.group)
pub.public_key = priv_key.public_key

data = ""some data to sign""
digest = OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256.new

puts pub.verify(digest, sig, data)

The Apple page doesn’t appear to specify the hash algorithm to use, but from what I’ve seen it looks like SHA-256 is right. (Also I could have got this completely wrong and Apple are using a completely different format. I’d be keen to know whether or not this code works you you).

The signature is created in .Net using BCrypt, the keys are also created using BCrypt and stored on the Microsoft key store. The signature and public key can sent to the AT chip and it verifies, however it does not work on Android.
Key / Signature Process:

The public key is exported from BCrypt in the x.509 key format which includes the identifiers for SHA256-ECDSA and the curve prime256v1 resulting in:

Android Process:

Create the X509 key spec and public key from the above key byte array:
X509EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(encoded);
KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""EC"", ""AndroidOpenSSL"");
pubKey = kf.generatePublic(keySpec);
Create signature using the AndroidOpenSSL provider:
Signature signature;
signature = Signature.getInstance(""SHA256withECDSA"", ""AndroidOpenSSL"");
signature.initVerify(pubKey);
Load the above hash array:
signature.update(hash);
Verify the above signature:
signature.verify(sign);

The signature and key above checks out on the AT chip (Also verified on ECDSA Sample which runs JavaScript-OpenSSL) but does not verify with AndroidOpenSSL.
Am I missing something simple or where can the problem be? 
The public key structure checks out on ASN.1 decoder and load successfully within the code (extracted and checked from the public key), the signature is in the expected format for Java and the hash values are the same on both sides.

change:

to:

","The crypto:sign/4 and crypto:generate_key/2 functions are quite confusing for ECDSA as ECDSA requires domain parameters, unlike the other two supported algorithms.
The error message simply tells you that the parameters you are passing do not match any clause of the crypto:sign/4 function. You are probably passing an argument of the wrong type.
You can look at the source code of the called function to find out why no clause match your parameters. This is typically what you would do for your own functions. Yet here, crypto:sign/4 is a system function which is properly documented.
The documentation reads as follows:

sign(Algorithm, DigestType, Msg, Key) -> binary()
Types:
Algorithm = rsa | dss | ecdsa
Msg = binary() | {digest,binary()}
The msg is either the binary ""cleartext"" data to be signed or it is the hashed value of ""cleartext"" i.e. the digest (plaintext).
DigestType = digest_type()
Key = rsa_private() | dss_private() | [ecdh_private(),ecdh_params()]

Your first three arguments are obviously ok. The issue is with the key. Indeed, your code goes like this:
{_PubKey, PriKey} = crypto:generate_key(ecdh, secp256k1)

Looking at the documentation of crypto:generate_key/2, you'll find out that in the case of ECDH, PrivKey is of type ecdh_private() and not [ecdh_private(),ecdh_params()] as crypto:sign/4 expects.
A fix would be to pass [PrivKey, secp256k1] to your sign_message function, as the sign function requires the identification of the curve domain parameters through the sign key parameter.

This happens to be the key used in section D.1 (NIST P-256 / secp256r1) of Suite B Implementer’s Guide to FIPS 186-3 (ECDSA).
Since the EC key format is mercifully short on INTEGER values (which can require padding bytes) you can build a manual extractor for each keysize you want to support.  Or you can go the live DER reading route.  Or you can try to get your private key serialized in a more friendly form for your application.

","You're using OpenSSL 1.1, and they have decided that you shouldn't be poking about at the innards of their structures anymore.
eckey->priv_key was a valid way of accessing the private key in OpenSSL 1.0.x, but now the only correct way is EC_KEY_get0_private_key(eckey)
Likewise, for the public key it's EC_KEY_get0_public_key(eckey).
Both of these functions were declared during OpenSSL 1.0.x, so you can write the code to be the same between them.
So
printf(""d: %s\n"", BN_bn2hex(eckey->priv_key));
printf(""X: %s\n"", BN_bn2hex(&eckey->pub_key->X));
printf(""Y: %s\n"", BN_bn2hex(&eckey->pub_key->Y));

would become
{
    const BIGNUM* d = EC_KEY_get0_private_key(eckey);
    const EC_POINT* Q = EC_KEY_get0_public_key(eckey);
    const EC_GROUP* group = EC_KEY_get0_group(eckey);
    BIGNUM* x = BN_new();
    BIGNUM* y = BN_new();

    if (!EC_POINT_get_affine_coordinates_GFp(group, Q, x, y, null))

What do i do wrong? Can anyone show me working example where Golang verifies signatre created with PHP?
I tried to use different versions in openssl_sign instead of OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256  . Tried OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA1, OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA512
","The problem with your code seems to be, that you hash the string in PHP using MD5 before signing it using OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256, which hashes what you sign (the MD5 hash) again, while in your Go program, you only have the first of these 2 hashes. To fix this, I would remove the MD5 step in the PHP code and replace the h := md5.New() line in your code with the hash used by your signature algorithm (h := sha256.New() in your example).
To elaborate a bit more on what theses signing functions do, I would first like to break signing and verifying down into the following steps:

Signing:


Hash the message
Encrypt the message's hash using the private key (this encrypted hash is the signature)

Verifying:


Hash the message
Decrypt the signature using the public key (this yields the hash which was encrypted while signing).
Compare the calculated and decrypted hashes. If they match, then the signature is correct.


Now the call to openssl_sign in your PHP code, does all the signing steps, while the call to ecdsa.Verify in Go, only does the second and third step of the verification process. And this is why it takes a hash as the second argument. So to verify a signature, you must implement the first verification step yourself, namely generating the hash. 
You must use the same hashing algorithm while signing and verifying, therefore you must use SHA256, not MD5, in your Go code (as you sign using OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256), otherwise the hashes will (generally) not match.
Also, I would recommend to not use MD5 for signatures, as it is no longer considered collision resistant (a hash collision is, when you have 2 different strings/files/... with the same hash). For more details about that, you can check the Wikipedia article on MD5, specifically the section ""Collision vulnerabilities"". This is a problem, as 2 messages with the same MD5 hash, will also have the same signature and an attacker could use the signature generated for one of the strings to trick you into thinking the other was signed (and therefore trust it).
Additionally, ecdsa.PrivateKey can give you the corresponding public key, and you can call ecdsa.Verify like this:
ecdsa.Verify(&prikey.PublicKey, data, &r, &s)

This saves you the trouble of copying all the data from the private key to a new object.

"46182659","How to delay sign the certificate request using Bouncy Castle with ECDSA signature?","I am trying to implement delay signing of a certificate request (CSR) with ECDSA signature algorithm using Bouncy Castle in C#. So far I've managed to implement this with RSA but not ECDSA. I use Pkcs10CertificationRequestDelaySigned class from Bouncy Castle.
A snippet of my test code that fails when verifying signature (full code is available below):
        [TestMethod]
        public void ValidCsrWithoutPassword_Ecdsa_SignatureIsAppended()
        {
            DelayCsrProvider sut = CreateSut();

            const string signAlgorithm = ""ECDSA"";
            var keys = new Keys(signAlgorithm);

            // Create CSR
            var signatureAlgorithm = ""SHA256withECDSA"";
            byte[] octetData = CreateCsr(keys.SignKeyPair, signatureAlgorithm);

            // Append password to CSR
            byte[] csrWithPass = sut.AppendPassword(octetData, ""some-text-1"");

            // Calculate HASH
            var hashAlgorithm = CmsSignedGenerator.DigestSha256;
            byte[] hash = sut.BuildHash(csrWithPass, hashAlgorithm);

            // Sign using HASH
            byte[] signature = Sign(hash, signAlgorithm, hashAlgorithm, keys.SignKeyPair.Private);

            // Add signature to CSR
            byte[] csrSigned = sut.AppendSignature(csrWithPass, signature);

            // Just verify the signature matches CSR's public key + data,
            // public key should match the private key
            // this is where it fails

            Verify(csrSigned);
        }

The scenario is:
 There are two entities (programs running on separate machines).
One has both private and public key - call it Signer and the other has additional information (like password) for extending certificate request with that information but NO access to private key - call it DelayCsrProvider.
The sequence is: 

Signer creates CSR without password and signs the data, sends it to DelayCsrProvider in PKCS#10 format DER encoded.
DelayCsrProvider creates new CSR with all the information from received CSR plus adds additional attribute that contains password. 
Now we have to sign this new CSR but we don't have private key. Instead we calculate hash (SHA-256) of data and send the digest to Signer.
Signer receives the hash and signs the hash, sends the signature back to DelayCsrProvider.
DelayCsrProvider inserts received signature into CSR thus creating a full CSR that has valid signature.

I've created DelayCsrProvider class and unit test that is making all the steps described above. One unit-test for RSA works just fine, the other unit test for ECDSA fails when verifying the signature.
What else can be done here to resolve ECDSA hash signing ?

","I found the problem with the way I was calculating the signature. For some reason it doesn't work for ECDSA, so here is the solution that works both for ECDSA and RSA (with SHA-256 hash). 
In short when calculating signature use ""NONEwithECDSA"" or ""NONEwithRSA"" and also RSA requires adding DigestInfo instead of bair signature as in ECDSA (I am still wondering why ?) .

"48994344","Python ECDSA, sign with private key with curve secp224k1","I'm really having a hard time getting to get to grips with this 3rd party Python module.
I'm trying to sign a 28-byte SHA-224 digest using a 28-byte SHA-224 digest private key under secp224k1.
My attempt:
import ecdsa

private_key = int(""b89ea7fcd22cc059c2673dc24ff40b978307464686560d0ad7561b83"", 16).to_bytes(28, byteorder='big')

sk = SigningKey.generate(private_key, curve=ecdsa.secp224k1) 
sig = sk.sign_digest(digest_msg)

>> AttributeError: module 'ecdsa' has no attribute 'secp224k1'

Hopelessly, I can't even google my way out of this error. 
","I suggest using the fastecdsa for doing this type of task.
As far as I know, ecdsa does not support secp224k1 curve.
fastecdsa does not support importing the key from a string, but you can export it to a pem format and import it using keys.import_key().
Check it here.
from fastecdsa import keys, curve, ecdsa

#generating the private key over secp224k1 curve
private_key = keys.gen_private_key(curve=curve.secp224k1)

#get the public key from the corresponding private key
public_key = keys.get_public_key(private_key, curve=curve.secp224k1)

msg = ""Sign this message with secp224k1""

r, s = ecdsa.sign(msg, private_key, curve.secp224k1)

print(ecdsa.verify((r, s), msg, public_key, curve.secp224k1))

Output:
True

","I couldn't figured out what is the problem between OpenSSL and Go.
But my main problem is, how to generate ECDSA certificate to use with Go code!
Using CFSSL (https://cfssl.org/) I can generate ECDSA certificate and sign it with my internal CA certificate generated from OpenSSL. The certificate generated from CFSSL works fine with my Go code, so for me it solves my main problem!
I don't know if there is a format problem between OpenSSL and Go, but as CFSSL is written in Go, the certificate generated on it works fine in my code and in browser.

How to properly implement this algorithm on a JCOP card?
","I'm not an expert on JCOP but I have experience with ISO7816:
Statusword 0x6F00 means ""General Error"". I suppose a CryptoException is thrown, but the value of ""reason"" is between 1-5 (according to the documentation).
It's not possible to return arbitrary values as ISO7816 statusword.
Therefore I would suggest to send the reason using apdu.sendBytes(...), then you know what really is the problem
Best way would be to debug the code

How to properly implement this algorithm on a JCOP card?
","Since you indicate that your call to KeyBuilder.buildKey(...) fails, I would assume that this call throws a CryptoException with reason code NO_SUCH_ALGORITHM. As you do not handle that exception in your code, this results in the status word 0x6F00 being retuned by the card (0x6F00 is typically returned in case of unhandled exceptions).
So the CryptoException indicates that the requested key algorithm is not supported. Since you use the following parameters
KeyBuilder.buildKey(
    KeyBuilder.TYPE_EC_FP_PRIVATE,  // key type
    KeyBuilder.LENGTH_EC_FP_192,    // key length
    true);                          // key encryption

this could mean that

the card does not support the EC_FP (elliptic curve over large prime field) key type / algorithm,
the card does not support a key length of 192, or
the card does not support key encryption.

As the FIPS 140-2 Cryptographic Module Security Policy for both JCOP 2.4.2 R2 and JCOP 2.4.2 R3 indicate that ECDSA key pair generation is supported for P-192 (besides P-224 and P-256), I would assume that your card does not support key encryption. Hence, you could instead try
KeyBuilder.buildKey(
    KeyBuilder.TYPE_EC_FP_PRIVATE,  // key type
    KeyBuilder.LENGTH_EC_FP_192,    // key length
    false);                         // key encryption

How to properly implement this algorithm on a JCOP card?
","I can see two different issues:

JCOP (mistakenly) requires you to set the private key parameters as well;
base point G seems to be in compressed format, which may not be supported, it is required to convert to a 49 byte uncompressed point instead.

Furthermore it should be noted that:

you should indeed first build the public key using KeyBuilder (currently commented out);
there is no reason to have a parameter S in there (the seed is of no consequence - at least I presume it's not a private key with that size);
you should really wrap key generation with a try / catch statement and (in the end) convert to an ISOException with a valid status word;
having a debugger available is of vital importance.

-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----

So I converted it into PKCS8 formate using command:
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in localhost.pem -out localhostpkcs8.pem

and loaded in Java using below code:
    Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());
    KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""EC"",""BC"");
    PKCS8EncodedKeySpec privateKeySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(Base64.decode(localhostpkcs8.getBytes()));
    PrivateKey privateKey=kf.generatePrivate(privateKeySpec);

Everything worked perfectly.

Doing the signing and verification in Java works just fine. Easy to configure of course, since they are all the same libs, parameters, and all.
To verify the same signature in Go, I tried:

    sigHex, _ := hex.DecodeString(sig)
    ePubKey := pubKey.(*ecdsa.PublicKey)
    ok := verifyMySig(ePubKey, ""This is string to sign"", sigHex)
    println(ok)
}

func verifyMySig(pub *ecdsa.PublicKey, msg string, sig []byte) bool {
    r := new(big.Int).SetBytes(sig[:len(sig)/2])
    s := new(big.Int).SetBytes(sig[len(sig)/2:])
    return ecdsa.Verify(pub, []byte(msg), r, s)
}

func hexToPrivateKey(hexStr string)  *ecdsa.PrivateKey {
    bytes, _ := hex.DecodeString(hexStr)

    k := new(big.Int)
    k.SetBytes(bytes)
    println(""k:"")
    fmt.Println(k.String())

    priv := new(ecdsa.PrivateKey)
    curve := elliptic.P256()
    priv.PublicKey.Curve = curve
    priv.D = k
    priv.PublicKey.X, priv.PublicKey.Y = curve.ScalarBaseMult(k.Bytes())

    return priv
}

Initially, I tried to just export the Private key in Java as a base64 encoded string, and import that into Go. But I could not figure out how to get Go to load the key in the format Java stores if (X509EncodedKeySpec). So instead, I tried this way to copy the big integer of the private key only, and generate the public key from that. If I get that to work, then try to copy just the public key..
Anyway, the Go code fails to verify the signature. It is always false. Also, I cannot figure out where to put the SHA function in Go from ""SHA1withECDSA"" part.
I am sure I am missing some basic concepts here. How to do this properly?
","Managed to get this to work. So just to document it for myself and anyone interested..
As pointed by in comments, the signature from Java is in ASN1 format. Found a nice description of the format here: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/how-can-i-convert-a-der-ecdsa-signature-to-asn-1.
I also found some good examples on how to do SHAxx with ECDSA in Go at https://github.com/gtank/cryptopasta (sign.go and sign_test.go). Just need to run the relevant SHA function before the ECDSA code.

Great this should have created an ECDSA private key. Now you need to make it into a certificate (possibly a self-signed certificate).
But in your following commands, you never use rootCA.key to make a certificate. Most probably you have generated an RSA certificate not ECDSA. Try to use -key rootCA.key in your openssl req command.

","An ECDSA signature is the value-pair (r, s).
Windows CNG emits this as a concatenation of the two values, and since .NET does not reinterpret the data, this is the de facto .NET format. (r is the first half of the array, s is the second half)
OpenSSL expects a DER encoded structure of SEQUENCE(INTEGER(r), INTEGER(s)).  This loosely means { 0x30, payload_length, 0x02, r_length, r_bytes[0]...r_bytes[r_length-1], 0x02, s_length, s_bytes[0]...s_bytes[s_length-1] }; though it's slightly trickier than that because padding bytes are required when r_bytes[0] or s_bytes[0] >= 0x80 (since that makes it appear as a negative number).
Unfortunately, there's not a general purpose DER encoder exposed in the framework by default.
If you're trying to run on Linux, you might be better served by using .NET Core, since the ECDSA implementation for Linux already does this data translation.

What I now want is to verify with openssl the ECDSA signature by the corresponding public key. This public key is contained in a x509 (NewCert.pem) which was created out of the private key in the HSM.
I tested many ways to verify the signature properly, but I didn't succeed.
openssl dgst -ecdsa-with-SHA1 -verify <(openssl x509 -noout -pubkey -in NewCert.pem) -signature <(cat sign | base64 -d) file

The file 'signature' contains the base64 encoded signature. And the file 'file' the plain data.
Thank you
","Finally I found a solution for my problem.
I)
The signature output of PyKCS11 is the concatenation of the r and s value of the ECDSA signature. It is not formatted in ASN1 style. This was the first problem why verification with openssl is not possible, because the latter requires this format.
II)
So I wrote a function that formats the PyKCS11 output to ASN1 conformity and saves the binary signature output to a file.
III)
In order to use hashing functions you first have to hash the data or the file to be signed. This can be done in Python with the command digest() of hashlib. After this you give this binary hash of the data as input to PyKCS11 and create the signature.
IV)
Verification of the hashed ECDSA signature can be done with the following command in openssl:
openssl dgst -sha384 -verify pubkey -signature file.sign file

Make sure that pubkey is the EC public key from the corresponding x509 certificate (not the x509 itself). And file.sign means to be the binary file which contains the ECDSA signature that represents the binary hash of the original data (see step III).
Hope this helps for somebody else.

LibraryInitializer init;
AutoSeeded_RNG rng;
EC_Group ecGroup(""secp256k1"");
ECDSA_PrivateKey key(rng, ecGroup);

Why am I generating such similar public keys?  And am I right in assuming that isn't ""safe"" if multiple users were to use this code to generate their own keys?

UPDATE:
The answer below seems correct. I emailed the creator of XCA, Christian Hohnstaedt, to probe a little further into how XCA generates this public key and what it is. He replied that it is the EC_POINT and is obtained by using the command 
openssl ec -pubin -noout -text

Plugging in the X509 PEM encoded public keys indeed reveals different public EC Points.  It should be noted (for other newbs like me) that the public EC Points in the answer do no good for another party on their own - the other party needs to know which EC Group is being used, and that's why the X509 PEM encoding is much more helpful than just an EC Point.
","The actual public keys from these are:
02:77:83:04:A9:B8:B9:B2:9B:BF:48:71:83:38:64:87

These are not the same, so there is no apparent reason to worry on that front. The data that is the same is the key meta-data and encoding bumf (which you would expect to be the same for identical format keys).

Can ECDSA signatures replaced  with Hash based signatures improves the message authenticity or not. 
","ECDSA is a hash based signature, in that the data gets hashed, then ECDSA is performed on the hash (not the whole data)
When it comes to data verification there are three main approaches:

Straight hash (e.g. SHA-2-256)

The fastest option to verify
If you are only protecting against line corruption this is a valid choice.
Otherwise, requires that the hash/digest value be sent over a secure (from tamper) channel, because the tampered can easily transmit the digest along with the tampered document
Provides no proof of origin

HMAC (e.g. HMACSHA256)

Requires that both the sender and receiver share the secret key
Either the sender or receiver having the key stolen puts both sides at risk
Secret key needs to come from key agreement algorithms (ECDH) or be transmitted in secret (encrypted)
Proves the document came from someone with the shared secret.

Digital Signature (e.g. ECDSA, RSA signature)


The sender is the only entity with the private key, receiver needs public key (non-secret)
Public key can be embedded in an X.509 certificate to provide a notarized association of public key to the signer
Or the public key can be transmitted raw over a secure (from tamper) channel.
Provides strong assurances about the document origin, since they shouldn't share their private key.


All three options use a hash algorithm to reduce the original data, the rest of the algorithms are what do you do with that data. There's not really a standard definition of ""secure"", you have to say ""secure against (something)"". ECDSA provides more assurances than HMAC as long as the private key isn't shared. But if HMAC provides enough assurance it is probably faster on average (specialty hardware aside).

How to convert ECDSA SIG signature to array of characters in C
  ...

The signature is already an array of bytes. That is what is returned from EVP_DigestSignFinal.

In general, you want to use the EVP_* interfaces for signing and verification. Below is from the OpenSSL wiki on EVP Signing and Verifying.
Your job below is to get the ECDSA into the EVP_PKEY*. The function will allocate the signature buffer with OPENSSL_malloc. The caller needs to free it with OPENSSL_free. The buffer is an array of bytes.
int sign_it(const byte* msg, size_t mlen, byte** sig, size_t* slen, EVP_PKEY* pkey)

"34487145","Get list of supported cipher suites (to detect ECDSA support)","I'm considering the possibility of using a content delivery network for my websites. Because I'm such a cheapskate, I am trying to reduce the cost of doing so.
There is a fantastic CDN that is extremely low cost, but only supports browsers and operating systems that support SNI and ECDSA key exchange. (Bonus points for those who guess which one it is!)
I am therefore thinking of using ngx_pagespeed to rewrite resources to the CDN for web browsers that support ECDSA key exchange, and either not use a CDN or use a more expensive (but compatible) CDN for those who don't.
Unfortunately, I could not find a way to have nginx detect ECDSA support of browsers. Here is what I have considered so far:

User-agent sniffing - this is generally a bad idea, and would not be able to detect those behind bad corporate proxies
Use JavaScript to detect support and set a cookie - this would make the client download resources twice after the first pageview, and would not work if the user has JavaScript or cookies disabled.
Serve a blank interstitial page containing detection JavaScript - this would again not work without JavaScript or cookies, and would be harmful to SEO. Additionally, this would be slow, and even slower if detection takes a long time behind some strange proxies.

I see that it is possible for a server to read the cipher suites, such as in Qualys SSL Labs or this FREAK attack testing tool. How could I read the list of client supported cipher suites in nginx?

I'm not sure how to properly convert private key ('D' parameter) from BC-BigInteger to MS-byte[]. Using BigInteger.ToByteArray() throws exception:

while validating ECParameters (method ECParameters.Validate()). Using BigInteger.ToByteArrayUnsigned() provides much better results (one failure on several hundred generated key-pairs), but still...
When using ToByteArray() converted 'D' is usually one byte longer ('D' has 33 bytes vs D.X and D.Y has 32 bytes). Using ToByteArrayUnsigned() the 'D' is sometimes one byte shorter.

","When you are getting too many bytes (33 in this case) the first byte should be 0x00, and you need to remove it.  When you are getting too few (technically speaking D=1 is valid) you need to insert zeros to fill the array out.
The reason is that .NET's structure expects D to look like it does to the underlying Windows CNG import API, which means that D is a fixed-with unsigned big endian big integer.  BouncyCastle is giving you the BER INTEGER encoding, which requires inserting a 0x00 byte when the high bit of the most significant byte (bytes[0], big endian) is set in a number that should be considered positive.
BER also has a rule that the minimum number of bytes be used, which is why sometimes BouncyCastle gives a number that's too small.
Q.X and Q.Y are okay because the ECPoint encoding rules specify a fixed size big endian integer whose size is determined by the curve; which is why BouncyCastle has the GetEncoded method instead of just ToByteArrayUnsigned.

Sending my request always results in a 401 NOT_AUTHORIZED error.
I've verified that the the contents of my header and claims are correct - I even found a Ruby script online for generating an ES256 signed JWT and using my Apple provided Issuer, Key ID, Private Key, it works swimmingly - Apple accepts the token. That tells me that my credentials are good and I'm doing something wrong in php.
Unless I've simply stared at this code for too long, the JWT format is correct, base64 encoded correctly, and the bearer token is set correctly in the header.
To rule out an issue with request sending I've tried both GuzzleHTTP and CLI cURL - both a 401.

Here's the relevant code. You'll see that the create method is encoding the header and claims, signing the ""payload"", and concatenating all 3.
public function create()
{
    $header = $this->encode(
        json_encode([
            'kid' => 'my_key_id',
            'alg' => 'ES256',
            'typ' => 'JWT',
        ])
    );

    $claims = $this->encode(
        json_encode([
            'iss' => 'my_issuer_uuid',
            'exp' => time() + (20 * 60),
            'aud' => 'appstoreconnect-v1',
        ])
    );

    $signature = $this->encode(
        $this->sign(""$header.$claims"")
    );

    return $header . '.' . $claims . '.' . $signature;
}

This code successfully returns an open ssl resource, $data has the expected contents.
public function sign($data)
{
    if (!$key = openssl_pkey_get_private('file://my_key_file.p8')) {
        throw new \Exception('Failed to read PEM');
    }

    if (!openssl_sign($data, $signature, $key, OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256)) {
        throw new \Exception('Claims signing failed');
    }

    return $signature;
}

Base64 URL encoding... $data has the expected contents.
public function encode($data)
{
    return str_replace(['+', '/', '='], ['-', '_', ''], base64_encode($data));
}

At this point I'm stumped to what it is I'm doing wrong or missing. I'm hoping some extra eyes will find something! Using the token that my code dumps out: 
curl  https://api.appstoreconnect.apple.com/v1/users --Header ""Authorization: Bearer <token>”

...always returns a 401. I suspect there's something wrong in the signing portion of the code as it's the only part I haven't been able to verify (again, worked in Ruby), though looking at all the docs and examples for openssl_sign, I'm pretty sure it's right.
For reference, this is the Ruby script I mention https://shashikantjagtap.net/generating-jwt-tokens-for-app-store-connect-api/

To rule out an issue with request sending I've tried both GuzzleHTTP and CLI cURL - both a 401.

Here's the relevant code. You'll see that the create method is encoding the header and claims, signing the ""payload"", and concatenating all 3.
public function create()
{
    $header = $this->encode(
        json_encode([
            'kid' => 'my_key_id',
            'alg' => 'ES256',
            'typ' => 'JWT',
        ])
    );

    $claims = $this->encode(
        json_encode([
            'iss' => 'my_issuer_uuid',
            'exp' => time() + (20 * 60),
            'aud' => 'appstoreconnect-v1',
        ])
    );

    $signature = $this->encode(
        $this->sign(""$header.$claims"")
    );

    return $header . '.' . $claims . '.' . $signature;
}

This code successfully returns an open ssl resource, $data has the expected contents.
public function sign($data)
{
    if (!$key = openssl_pkey_get_private('file://my_key_file.p8')) {
        throw new \Exception('Failed to read PEM');
    }

    if (!openssl_sign($data, $signature, $key, OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256)) {
        throw new \Exception('Claims signing failed');
    }

    return $signature;
}

Base64 URL encoding... $data has the expected contents.
public function encode($data)
{
    return str_replace(['+', '/', '='], ['-', '_', ''], base64_encode($data));
}

At this point I'm stumped to what it is I'm doing wrong or missing. I'm hoping some extra eyes will find something! Using the token that my code dumps out: 
curl  https://api.appstoreconnect.apple.com/v1/users --Header ""Authorization: Bearer <token>”

...always returns a 401. I suspect there's something wrong in the signing portion of the code as it's the only part I haven't been able to verify (again, worked in Ruby), though looking at all the docs and examples for openssl_sign, I'm pretty sure it's right.

Do you have any hint why this would not result in the same signature output every time I run this code?
A similar question was raised here, but no real answer has been found yet.
Another question related to that: 
I see that there is another initSign method provided by the Signature class:
initSign(PrivateKey privateKey, SecureRandom random)
Why would I wanna insert a random source/seed when creating a signature? How is the receiving side supposed to verify that signature then if the random seed is not known?
Thanks for any valuable input!

","The specification of the algorithm explains it:

One characteristic of DSA and ECDSA is that they need to produce, for
     each signature generation, a fresh random value (hereafter designated
     as k).  For effective security, k must be chosen randomly and
     uniformly from a set of modular integers, using a cryptographically
     secure process.  Even slight biases in that process may be turned
     into attacks on the signature schemes.

So what you're seeing is perfectly normal. Of course, the designers of the algorithms made it possible for the receiver to verify the signature, otherwise it would be pointless. That's what your test should verify.

Is there any openssl API which I can use to find out if the cipher we are going to set is compatible with the certificate or with protocol or not?

If you author the app and own the server, then YES, you do know what to expect. But the general case is NO, you don't know in advance and you can't query for it. You try to setup a channel and if it fails, then you try something else.
Generally speaking, there's no way to know in advance what cipher suites a server supports; or what type of public key is bound in the server's certificate. In fact, there's no way to know what protocol versions (SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, etc) a server supports. Its the reason for RFC 7405, TLS Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value (SCSV) for Preventing Protocol Downgrade Attacks.
In 2016/2017, about the best you can do is assume:

No SSLv2, SSLv3; only TLS 1.0 and above
Cipher suites from the collection ""HIGH:!aNULL:!kRSA:!RC4:!MD5""

""!kRSA"" is ""no RSA key transport"", and it means you can only use ephemeral key exchanges. If a server has a RSA key, then it will only be used for authentication. That is, the key will be used to sign the server's ephemeral values during key exchange so the client knows they are authentic.

","Your certificate is using the brainpoolP160r1 curve. This curve is supported by libcrypto but not by libssl. Probably because this is insufficiently secure (it only offers the equivalent of 80 bits of security). Probably if you tried a different (more secure) curve you will get better results.
You don't say what version of OpenSSL you are using. Note that in OpenSSL 1.1.0 the ""default"" curves supported by OpenSSL are X25519, P-256, P-384 and P-512. If you want to use other curves you will probably have to explicitly state them using the ""-curves"" parameter to s_server. The only brainpool curves that libssl supports in OpenSSL 1.1.0 are brainpoolP256r1, brainpoolP384r1 and brainpoolP512r1.
Edit:
I also note that you have an X509v3 Key Usage of ""Key Encipherment"" which doesn't make any sense for an ECDSA cert (ECDSA can't ""encipher"" anything; its a digital signature algorithm). Change the key usage to ""Digital Signature"" (or drop it altogether).

","Problem solved.
I changed brainpoolP160r1 with prime256v1 and removed keyUsage=KeyEncipherment from the openssl.conf of signing CA,
then it start working as espected. Now i guess why?
RFC 5280 section 4.2.1.3 says :

The keyEncipherment bit is asserted when the subject public key is
        used for enciphering private or secret keys, i.e., for key
        transport.  For example, this bit shall be set when an RSA public
        key is to be used for encrypting a symmetric content-decryption
        key or an asymmetric private key.

Is this appening during ssl handshake or not?

","I don't believe there is a true standard, but this topic has been discussed in the IETF mailing archives. While the conversation seemed to get a little side-tracked by whether or not canonical JSON was a good idea in general, there was one method that seems reasonable as a standard fingerprinting method.

Remove all ""metadata"" fields from the JWK (where in this case ""metadata"" is defined as any non-required key, ie anything but ""kty"" and the parameters for the encryption algorithm defined by the JWA RFC-7518).
Convert stripped JWK into ""canonical"" JSON (sort keys lexicographically, no leading or trailing whitespace, and no whitespace between tokens).
Compute digest over created JSON string.

There is also no true standard that I am aware of for canonical JSON, but all the sources I've seen agree on at least the rules listed above (which are the only rules that should be relevant for the types of objects used for JWK's).

val keyPairGenerator: KeyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""EC"")
keyPairGenerator.initialize(256)
val keys = keyPairGenerator.generateKeyPair

","The value returned from Java PrivateKey.getEncoded() is an encoded privatekey, as the name says. Specifically as documented in the superclass Key it is an ASN.1 (DER) encoding of PKCS#8 = Public-Key Cryptography Standard #8, Private Key Information Syntax. PKCS#8 handles privatekeys for a wide variety of different public-key algorithms and contains metadata in addition to the actual key, namely an 'AlgorithmIdentifier' which identifies the algorithm and any parameters of the algorithm; for the ECC algorithm(s) (ECDSA, ECDH, ECMQV and more share one key format) these parameters specify the elliptic curve group used, and although there are several options for this specification, in practice everyone, including here Java, uses the 'namedCurve' option which defines the curve group by an ASN.1 OID aka Object Identifier. 
The PKCS#8 structure then contains the actual privatekey data, 'wrapped' in an OCTET STRING, in a format that varies depending on the algorithm. For ECC, this format is defined (AFAICT) in SEC1 by SECG/Certicom and contains the actual privatekey value (a number, expressed as an OCTET STRING) plus optionally the curve spec and the public key.
Your first code uses BouncyCastle, and Bouncy generates the encoding with the wrapped value including the optional curve spec and public key, making it longer.
Your second code uses by default the Oracle/Sun provider (SunEC), which generates the encoding without those options, but still including the required AlgorithmIdentifier making it longer than the actual privatekey value. It also uses a different curve: initializing a SunEC generator with the integer 256 chooses secp256r1 (aka P-256, prime256v1) NOT secp256k1. If you change this to use new ECGenParameterSpec(""secp256k1"") as the parameter then SunEC will also generate secp256k1, but without the options, giving a 64-byte encoding.
In both cases, if you want only the privatekey number, cast to java.security.interfaces.ECPrivateKey and use getS(). If you want the result in a byte/octet array, as is conventional, note BigInteger.toByteArray() returns a variable-length result and you often need to left zero trim or pad it.
And if you did want the publickey, it has a similar scheme using 'X.509' encoding which contains both an AlgorithmIdentifier and a BIT STRING wrapping the actual publickey value, and thus is longer than the raw publickey value. However in this case interfaces.ECPublicKey and spec.ECPoint won't construct the encoding for you; using the Bouncy-only types can be more convenient.

To create ""Client"" certificate (signed by ""Root"") slightly modified algorithm can be used.
The difference is that the private key (used to sign public key from keypair generated for ""Client"" certificate) must be supplied from the ""outside"" - it is a private-key of ""Root"" certificate.
But this is the issue. I cannot find a way how to get and translate private key to type Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Parameters.ECPrivateKeyParameters that could be passed to signature-factory.

byte[] msRootCertData = File.ReadAllBytes(@""c:\root_ecdsa_cert.pfx"");

// here comes the issue:

// 2. generate ""Client"" key-pair:

ECPrivateKeyParameters bcClientPrivKey = (ECPrivateKeyParameters)bcClientKeyPair.Private;

    }
}

// The original key object was disposed,
// but publicPrivate.GetECDsaPrivateKey() still works.

If you want to add publicPrivate to an X509Store you need to either 1) export it to a PFX and re-import it, or 2) change the key creation to use a named key.  Otherwise, only the public portion will be saved (on Windows).

You can't.
Private keys cannot be generated from public keys. This is absolutely fundamental to public key cryptography.

I get the following errors..

...

NameError: name 'addr' is not defined

You must define or initialize addr before using it.

TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable

See TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable in Python

IndentationError: unexpected indent

Python depends on indentation as part of its syntax, for example indentation is used to define blocks where other languages might use { and } or begin and end.
If you have too much or too little indentation it alters the meaning of the code and may not make any sense. You must pay careful attention to indentation when using Python.
In particular, I suspect that if you set tab-spacing to other than 8 and irregularly mix tabs with spaces in indentation, you will have problems.

There are also multiple ways to represent a signature. The default sk.sign() and vk.verify() methods present it as a short string, for simplicity and minimal overhead. To use a different scheme, use the sk.sign(sigencode=) and vk.verify(sigdecode=) arguments. There are helper funcions in the ""ecdsa.util"" module that can be useful here.

May I use some G1 and C1 for public key generation and other curve C2 for signing and verification?
I know it sounds strange but my actual goal is to use GOST private keys in ECDSA (I already have them and have to use them). Hence, GOST public may be generated from special C1, G1 and Java's SHA256withECDSA probably uses other curve who knows.

How detect curve used by Signature ecdsaSign = Signature.getInstance(""SHA256withECDSA"", ""BC"");?
If sign and verify returns true, does it mean that GOST keys which I gave to ECDSA are compatible with ECDSA?

  ecdsaSign.initSign(privateKeyGOST);
  ecdsaSign.update(""aaaa"".getBytes(""UTF-8""));
  byte[] signature = ecdsaSign.sign();

  ecdsaVerify.initVerify(publicKeyGOST);
  ecdsaVerify.update(""aaaa"".getBytes(""UTF-8""));
  System.out.println();
  System.out.println(ecdsaVerify.verify(signature));  //TRUE


Note, that curve for GOST key generation and internal curve of SHA256withECDSA  may be not equal that's why I'm asking this question.
UPDATE
Answer to 

May I use some G1 and C1 for public key generation and other curve C2 for signing and verification?

No, C1 must be equal to C2. 
It's possible to detect BC curve - I looked in SignatureSpi sources of BC and saw that curve params taken from key. And discovered C2 equals to known C1. In other words, not SHA256withECDSA but prKey.getAlgorithm() decides. 
BUT!! Compability of keys doesn't mean that it's safe to use it. GOST curve has special invariants which may impact at some ECDSA steps - this is interesting but very hard question - is there any weak points of  GOST curves in ECDSA. So, answer is ""compatible but check carefully math staff before using"" 
Note, that KBKDF will not save from GOST curve weakness in ECDSA (if it really exists behind the ""math-crypto-scenes""
","I'll answer in order:


How detect curve used by Signature ecdsaSign = Signature.getInstance(""SHA256withECDSA"", ""BC"");


You can't because the public & private keys should contain the parameters, not the algorithm. However, only certain curve parameters will be supported by the underlying library. In the case of Bouncy Castle those are those for the F(p) and F(2^m) curves. These include at least the NIST and Brainpool curves.


If sign and verify returns true, does it mean that GOST keys which I gave to ECDSA are compatible with ECDSA?


Yes, you can safely assume that. If that wasn't the case then there would be something seriously wrong with the verification. As you may now understand this is because C1 = C2.

Note that you should not use secret keys like this, especially if the secret keys are also used for the GOST algorithm itself. It is good practice to not mix values. You should rather use the (leftmost) bytes of SHA-256 over the secret key value instead (if you have to use it). It would be even better to use a Key Based Key Derivation Function (KBKDF).

","There are two possible reasons of your troubles:

Your status word does not follow status words recommended by ISO7816. Try
ISOException.throwIt((short) ((short) (0x9C00) | reason));

instead of
ISOException.throwIt(reason);

You forgot to set parameters of your elliptic curve before generating a new key pair. You should generate your EC key pair this way:
KeyPair keyPair = new KeyPair(KeyPair.ALG_EC_FP, KeyBuilder.LENGTH_EC_FP_192);
ECPrivateKey privKey = (ECPrivateKey) keyPair.getPrivate();
ECPublicKey pubKey = (ECPublicKey) keyPair.getPublic();
initDomainParams(pubKey);
initDomainParams(privKey);
keyPair.genKeyPair();

where
private void initDomainParams(ECKey key) {
    key.setFieldFP(F, (short)0, (short)F.length);
    key.setA(A, (short)0, (short)A.length);
    key.setB(B, (short)0, (short)B.length);
    key.setG(G, (short)0, (short)G.length);
    key.setR(R, (short)0, (short)R.length);
}

with F, A, B, G, R parameters of the elliptic curve you have chosen for your signature. See the list of recommended curves here: http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/documents/dss/NISTReCur.pdf

"44829426","Can I create a JCE ECPublicKey from a Q value from an openssh public key and ECParameterSpec","I'm reading openssh format elliptic curve public keys (RFC 5656, section 3.1) and would like to get from a BigInteger Q value to an ECPublicKey instance using JCE (rather than say BouncyCastle). I want to do this to verify JWT signatures.
e.g. https://api.github.com/users/davidcarboni/keys: 
ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBK8hPtB72/sfYgNw1WTska2DNOJFx+QhUxuV6OLINSD2ty+6gxcM8yZrvMqWdMePGRb2cGh8L/0bGOk+64IQ/pM=

It looks like I can use ECPublicKeySpec. This takes two parameters. An ECPoint and an ECParameterSpec. I'm able to get the parameter spec using the following JCE code (and the openssh identifier from the key data, say ""nistp256""):
ECParameterSpec getECParameterSpec(String identifier) {
    try {
        AlgorithmParameters parameters = AlgorithmParameters.getInstance(""EC"");
        String name = identifier.replace(""nist"", ""sec"") + ""r1"";
        parameters.init(new ECGenParameterSpec(name));
        return parameters.getParameterSpec(ECParameterSpec.class);
    } catch (InvalidParameterSpecException | NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Unable to get parameter spec for identifier "" + identifier, e);
    }
}

I've successfully parsed the Q value from the key data. RFC 5656 tells me that ""Q is the public key encoded from an elliptic curve point into an octet string"") however the constructor of JCE's ECPoint class takes two parameters, X and Y.
Can I get to X and Y from Q, or do I need to take a different approach? 
(NB I quite rightly don't have access to the private key)
","The base64 portion of your input has the equivalent hex of
00 00 00 13 65 63 64 73 61 2D 73 68 61 32 2D 6E 
69 73 74 70 32 35 36 00 00 00 08 6E 69 73 74 70

18 E9 3E EB 82 10 FE 93 

65 63 64 jumped out to me as ""ecd"" (sure enough, ""ecdsa-sha2-nistp256"").
So the blob looks to be

Big Endian length of a string/payload (19)
The string ""ecdsa-sha2-nistp256""
Big Endian length of a string/payload (8)
The string ""nistp256""
Big Endian length of a payload (0x41 == 65)
The encoded ECPoint Q (04 AF 21 ... 10 FE 93)

The encoded ECPoint starts with 04 indicating it is an uncompressed point (the most common encoding).  The 04 encoding rules (from http://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf, 2.3.5, step 3) say that the remaining payload is X and Y, each left-padded with zeros to the encoding size of the curve field.
So your ECPoint looks like
04
Qx:
AF 21 3E D0 7B DB FB 1F 62 03 70 D5 64 EC 91 AD
83 34 E2 45 C7 E4 21 53 1B 95 E8 E2 C8 35 20 F6
Qy:
B7 2F BA 83 17 0C F3 26 6B BC CA 96 74 C7 8F 19
16 F6 70 68 7C 2F FD 1B 18 E9 3E EB 82 10 FE 93

In C# you'd need to a) reverse the bytes of each of Qx and Qy (because the .NET BigInteger expects Little Endian, and these are Big Endian) and b) put a padding 0x00 byte as more significant than the 0xAF and 0xB7 bytes, since they have their high bits set (and would be interpreted as negative numbers).  Don't know if Java has either of those quirks.

","No, having two ECDSA signatures over the same data doesn't reveal if it was signed by the same party twice or two different parties.
In order to talk about how ECDSA works we need some quick (loosely defined) terms:

G, the Generator, is a point on the curve.


The public key associated with a private key (d) for a curve is d * G, using curve math we won't talk about here.
For brainpoolP320r1 the G value is broken down as x and y in RFC5639, section 3.5.

n, the curve Order, is the biggest legal value for d given G.


RFC5639 calls this value q, but most everything else calls it n.


There's a breakdown of ECDSA on Wikipedia, but the gist of the formula is:

Create a random number k such that 0 < k < n
r is an integer equal to the X coordinate of the EC Point k * G
Let z be the message digest interpreted as a number (with some trimming/extension)
Let kInv be the inverse of k modulo n (see also the Extended Euclidean Algorithm).
Let s be kInv * (z + (r * d)) mod n
The signature is (r, s).


In .NET the (r, s) value is represented in the IEEE P1363 format, which means the first half is r and the second half is s, their lengths determined by the curve.


So, the first half of the signature is effectively a random number. Elliptic Curve Cryptography is based on the fact that it's hard to compute Q / G (where Q is the public key, aka a point on the curve), so recovering k from r is hard.
The second half of the signature (s) is the only part where the signer key is involved, but it gets beat up a lot by k.
The signature verification algorithm then checks if Q and z' (the verifier's version of z), combined with r and s make a formula balance.  If it doesn't, there's no indication of whether it was because the hash/digest was wrong or the public key was wrong.

FEHLER: Öffentlicher Schlüssel stimmt nicht mit gespeichertem Schlüsselsatz überein.
Das Testen der Signatur ist fehlgeschlagen.

The last part translates as:
ERROR: Certificate public key does NOT match stored keyset
Signature test FAILED 

You can see that the public key itself is identical, just the AlgorithmIdentifier is different. I do not know where the container public key comes from, the certification request matches the AlgorithmIdentifier from the certificate public key shown above.
If I try to create the csr with the AlgorithmIdentifier of the container public key shown above, I get an error in the PKI ""encoded key spec not recognized"".
All this leeds me to the conclusion that I am doing something wrong with the csr.
I will not post the whole code as it spawns mutliple classes just the part wher the SubjectPublicKeyInfo is constructed as this seems to be the part where things go wrong:
Code  that creates valid ASN1 but results in the error above (Signature test failed)
byte[] publicKey = ecPublicKeyParameters.Q.GetEncoded();
string base64PublicKey = Convert.ToBase64String(publicKey);
// This base64PublicKey is send to the server, that handles it with the code below:

var ecPars = TeleTrusTNamedCurves.GetByName(""brainpoolP384r1"");
ECDomainParameters ecDomPars = new ECDomainParameters(
    ecPars.Curve,
    ecPars.G,
    ecPars.N,
    ecPars.H,
    ecPars.GetSeed());
var curve = ecDomPars.Curve;
byte[] data = Convert.FromBase64String(base64PublicKey);
var ecPoint = curve.DecodePoint(data);
ECPublicKeyParameters publicKey = new ECPublicKeyParameters(ecPoint, ecDomPars);
SubjectPublicKeyInfo publicKeyInfo = SubjectPublicKeyInfoFactory.CreateSubjectPublicKeyInfo(ecPublicKeyParameters);

Code that creates valid ASN1 that makes the PKI complain:
// Using ECDsaCng directly in the hope that the certificate will be valid for windows:
 ECParameters ecParams = ecdsaPair.ExportParameters(false);
 ECPoint ecPoint = ecParams.Q;
 IEnumerable<byte> blobBytes = ecPoint.X.Concat(ecPoint.Y);
 byte[] eccblob = blobBytes.ToArray();
 // Sending this to the server where it will be used for SubjectPublicKeyInfo

AlgorithmIdentifier algorithmIdentifier = new AlgorithmIdentifier(new DerObjectIdentifier(""1.2.840.10045.2.1""), new DerObjectIdentifier(""1.3.36.3.3.2.8.1.1.11""));
SubjectPublicKeyInfo publicKeyInfo = new SubjectPublicKeyInfo(algorithmIdentifier, new DerBitString(eccblob));

How can I create a valid SubjectPublicKeyInfo that satisfies the PKI and the certutil validation?
","The problem with the cert-as-created seems to be that the certificate uses explicit curve domain parameters (which the RFCs frown on), and the private key did curve normalization to get back to a named curve, which you seem to have identified given the second approach.
In your ""more manual"" approach you didn't encode the public key correctly, you need a leading 04 to indicate that you're sending an uncompressed coordinate pair.  (04 [x coordinate] [y coordinate]).  The CA likely rejected your request because it didn't understand it.

"40735653","Create PKCS 10 with Eliptic Curve in iOS","I'm on R&D to create PKCS 10 CSR, I googled and found very good help on github of this man done, I've done with RSA kSecAttrKeyTypeRSA, Now I want to done same with Eliptic Curve kSecAttrKeyTypeEC but I'm not able to find that need help on this.
EDITED:
I tried to convert SCCR.mfrom RSA to ECDSAwithSHA256

I get OID of ECDSAWithSHA256 and convert into hex.
Change SHA1 with 256 in whole class like CC_SHA256_CTX.
Created keypair with kSecAttrKeyTypeEC instead of kSecAttrKeyTypeRSA.

After all this i am getting PEM file in which signature isn't valid. 
Here below is my whole class.

"54548803","Retrieve ECDSA public key from only x-compressed coordinate using Crypto++ library","I'm implementing a security daemon on the vehicular communication scope.
I could receive a message with a signature and the compressed X coordinate of a point to verify that signature. The elliptic curve can be either the secp256 or the brainpoolp256r1 and the algorithm is ECDSA.
My question is: how can I recover the ECC Point (and so the public key) given only the compressed X coordinate with the Crypto++ library?
I followed some links which explain it (and many others) https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Point_Compression Crypto++ and Compressed EC keys but they don't fit my problem.
I tried to produce code to resolve the problem, but it won't work:
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <cryptopp/cryptlib.h>
#include <cryptopp/ecp.h>
#include <cryptopp/eccrypto.h>
#include <cryptopp/hex.h>
#include <cryptopp/oids.h>
#include <cryptopp/osrng.h>

using namespace CryptoPP;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::string;

int main() 
{
    string compactPoint = ""937120662418500f3ad7c892b1db7e7c2d85ec48c74e99d64dcb7083082bb4f3"";

    AutoSeededRandomPool generator;
    ECDSA<ECP, SHA256>::PublicKey pubKey;
    OID curve       = ASN1::secp256r1();


    StringSource ss (compactPoint, true, new CryptoPP::HexDecoder);
    ECP::Point point;

    pubKey.GetGroupParameters().GetCurve().DecodePoint (point, ss, ss.MaxRetrievable());

    std::cout << ""Result after decompression X: "" << std::hex << point.x << std::endl;
    std::cout << ""Result after decompression Y: "" << std::hex << point.y << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

Can you help me please?
","The easiest solution is probably to prepend ""02"" oe ""03"" to the compact representation. Crypto++ will then decode it as a compressed public key.
$ cat test.cxx

#include ""cryptlib.h""
#include ""eccrypto.h""
#include ""ecp.h""
#include ""hex.h""
#include ""oids.h""

#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    using namespace CryptoPP;

    ECDSA<ECP, SHA256>::PublicKey pubKey;
    pubKey.AccessGroupParameters().Initialize(ASN1::secp256r1());

    std::string compactPoint = ""02"" /* compressed */
        ""937120662418500f3ad7c892b1db7e7c""
        ""2d85ec48c74e99d64dcb7083082bb4f3"";

    StringSource ss (compactPoint, true, new HexDecoder);
    ECP::Point point;

    pubKey.GetGroupParameters().GetCurve().DecodePoint (point, ss, ss.MaxRetrievable());

    std::cout << ""Result after decompression X: "" << std::hex << point.x << std::endl;
    std::cout << ""Result after decompression Y: "" << std::hex << point.y << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

And then building and running the program. Notice the library solves for the y portion of the coordinate.
cryptopp$ g++ test.cxx ./libcryptopp.a -o test.exe
cryptopp$ ./test.exe
Result after decompression X: 937120662418500f3ad7c892b1db7e7c2d85ec48c74e99d64dcb7083082bb4f3h
Result after decompression Y: cfcaf74eae3ceec5993928f04970cfef343b9a6b22727fa81926bd21f256ec56h


And to save you the trouble of looking it up, you can set the public element for publicKey using:
pubKey.SetPublicElement(point);

std::cout << ""X: "" << std::hex << pubKey.GetPublicElement().x << std::endl;
std::cout << ""Y: "" << std::hex << pubKey.GetPublicElement().y << std::endl;

Running with the additional code produces the expected result:
$ ./test.exe
Result after decompression X: 937120662418500f3ad7c892b1db7e7c2d85ec48c74e99d64dcb7083082bb4f3h
Result after decompression Y: cfcaf74eae3ceec5993928f04970cfef343b9a6b22727fa81926bd21f256ec56h
X: 937120662418500f3ad7c892b1db7e7c2d85ec48c74e99d64dcb7083082bb4f3h
Y: cfcaf74eae3ceec5993928f04970cfef343b9a6b22727fa81926bd21f256ec56h


If interested, here is the code you are using to decode the point from ecp.cpp:
bool ECP::DecodePoint(ECP::Point &P, BufferedTransformation &bt, size_t encodedPointLen) const
{
    byte type;
    if (encodedPointLen < 1 || !bt.Get(type))
        return false;

    switch (type)
    {
    case 0:
        P.identity = true;
        return true;
    case 2:
    case 3:
    {
        if (encodedPointLen != EncodedPointSize(true))
            return false;

        Integer p = FieldSize();

        P.identity = false;
        P.x.Decode(bt, GetField().MaxElementByteLength());
        P.y = ((P.x*P.x+m_a)*P.x+m_b) % p;

        if (Jacobi(P.y, p) !=1)
            return false;

        P.y = ModularSquareRoot(P.y, p);

        if ((type & 1) != P.y.GetBit(0))
            P.y = p-P.y;

        return true;
    }
    case 4:
    {
        if (encodedPointLen != EncodedPointSize(false))
            return false;

        unsigned int len = GetField().MaxElementByteLength();
        P.identity = false;
        P.x.Decode(bt, len);
        P.y.Decode(bt, len);
        return true;
    }
    default:
        return false;
    }
}

I mention it in case you want to solve for the y coordinate yourself, populate the point, and then call SetPublicElement directly.

You can also prepend 03 instead of 02. The difference is, the decoding returns either y or p-y. The variability is introduced due to the modular square root shown above. We need to see the generation algorithm to determine what the value should be.
Here is the difference when using 03 instead of 02:
$ ./test.exe
X: 937120662418500f3ad7c892b1db7e7c2d85ec48c74e99d64dcb7083082bb4f3h
Y: 303508b051c3113b66c6d70fb68f3010cbc46595dd8d8057e6d942de0da913a9h

Notice 03 produces the y coordinate 303508b051c3113b66c6d70fb68f3010cbc46595dd8d8057e6d942de0da913a9h instead of 02 and cfcaf74eae3ceec5993928f04970cfef343b9a6b22727fa81926bd21f256ec56h.

"47138729","openSSL: Import ECDSA signature from raw data with compressed CurvePoint R instead of r","I want to verify some data packets which contain an ECDSA signature that is not ASN.1 DER encoded.
I am trying to perform the task with openSSL (version 1.1.0) as it seems to bring all the required functionality.
Currently I am stuck with importing the signature from the data packet.
The signature looks like this:

(The last 4 bytes should not be marked as part of the signature)
TShark shows the relevant part like this:

    ""gn.sh.sig"": {
      ""gn.st.pka"": ""0"",
      ""gn.st.eccpointtype"": ""3"",
      ""gn.st.opaque"": ""1f:f8:ad:a7:fd:99:b2:a8:a2:69:d4:d6:67:e5:ee:5b:3f:8b:e8:7f:49:fc:b4:79:95:98:15:0d:cb:bd:06:3c"",

    }


The encoding is according ETSI TS 103 097 v1.2.1
The first entry opaque together with the ECC Point type form an EccPoint named R while the second field opaque is named s.
My first step is to create a signature in openSSL and import the data into it. 
My code (error handling removed to reduce size) looks like this:
#include <openssl/conf.h>
#include <openssl/evp.h>
#include <openssl/err.h>
#include <openssl/ec.h>

  BN_CTX *bn_ctx = BN_CTX_new();
  BN_CTX_start(bn_ctx);

  // Create signature and import from packet.
  BIGNUM *bn_r = BN_CTX_get(bn_ctx);
  BIGNUM *bn_s = BN_CTX_get(bn_ctx);

  res = BN_hex2bn(&bn_r, sig_r_hex);
  res = BN_hex2bn(&bn_s, sig_s_hex);

  ECDSA_SIG *signature = ECDSA_SIG_new();
  res = ECDSA_SIG_set0(signature, bn_r, bn_s);
  printf(""ECDSA_SIG_set0(): %d\n"", res);

  // ...
  // Create hash of message and verify signature with public key
  //...
}

int main(int arc, char *argv[])

  ERR_load_crypto_strings();
  OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms();
  OPENSSL_config(NULL);

  verify_signature();

  EVP_cleanup();
  CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data();
  ERR_free_strings();
  return 0;
}

What I am currently missing is how I should handle the value R properly. 
Which parts of the compressed CurvePoint should be used as r to initialize the signature?
Do I need to uncompress y part?
Do I have to add some indication for the compressed y value?
Any hints are welcome.
Edit:
From what I read in IEEE1609.2 and SEC-1 it is possible to add additional information to allow for faster computation of R from r. This may the the point R itself.
As r = xR mod n it should be possible to calculate r from the EccPoint.
Does openSSL support this mechanism to speed up verification or do I really have to remove the extra information (and find out how to do it) to feed r into openSSL?

            EcdsaSignature ecdsa_signature;
        unknown:
            opaque signature<var>;
    }
} Signature;

You know that it's ECDSA on P-256, using SHA256, and that we've got a ""compressed y-1"" point.  Lets first resolve all of the 'select' portions of these structs using what we know, and eliminate all of the 'extern' fields:
struct {
    PublicKeyAlgorithm algorithm; // 1 byte = 0x00 (""ecdsa, P-256, sha256"")
    {                             //EcdsaSignature ecdsa_signature
        {                         //EccPoint R
            EccPointType type;        //1 byte = 0x03 (""compressed lsb y-1"")
            opaque x[field_size];     //these are the first 32 opaque bytes
            ;                         // select(type) resolves to nothing.
        }  
        opaque s[field_size];     //these are the second 32 opaque bytes
    }
} Signature;

Okay. That's simpler.  Now we know what all of the bytes are.  So what's all this business about ""compressed points""?  At its heart, point-compression is really about minimizing the amount of data that has to be sent over the network.  It turns out that, given the X coordinate of a point on a NIST curve, you can solve for the Y coordinate, but there are 2 possible answers.  Some clever people at Certicom noticed that the two possible Y coordinates that go with a given X coordinate always differ in their least-significant bit---thus while they have to send all of X, they could get away with only sending the LSb of Y (i.e., just enough info so you know which of the two solutions for Y is correct).  So that EccPointType of ""compressed lsb y-1"" tells you that for your X coordinate, the correct Y coordinate is the one that has a 1 in the LSb. 
The best news about this is that you don't have to care.  ECDSA only uses the X coordinate of R, which is sitting there in the first opaque blob labeled 'x'.
So this was a long-winded explanation to say ""you don't have to do anything.  You're already holding the right r (= X coord of R) and s to feed into OpenSSL's ECDSA_do_verify.

During verification, you will load the persisted or serialized key after setting point compression to true.

Below is a little program to experiment with point compression. You can find it on the Crypto++ wiki under Point Compression.
It generates a random key, then creates two public key - one with and and without compression. They two public keys are serialized. Then, it loads two new public keys with the serialized values.
Key 1 (no compress) and Key 2 (compress) and saved, then Key 3 (no compress) and Key 4 (no compress) are loaded from saved values. The keys are the same, and the output is:

You can even cross wires when loading the serialized keys and it just works. Below, the compressed key was loaded from a non-compressed serialization (and vice-versa):
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Two new keys to load up the persisted keys, but crossing wires
//   so so there's a compress/uncompressed mismatch
ECDSA<ECP, SHA1>::PublicKey publicKey5, publicKey6;
publicKey6.AccessGroupParameters().SetPointCompression(true);

// This should be `p1`
publicKey5.Load(StringSource(p2, true).Ref());
// This should be `p2`
publicKey6.Load(StringSource(p1, true).Ref());

// Get the public elemnts of the loaded keys
const ECP::Point& y5 = publicKey5.GetPublicElement();
const Integer& y5_x = y5.x;
const Integer& y5_y = y5.y;

const ECP::Point& y6 = publicKey6.GetPublicElement();
const Integer& y6_x = y6.x;
const Integer& y6_y = y6.y;

// Print some stuff about them
cout << ""Key 5 (after deserialization of Key 1):"" << endl;
cout << ""  y5.x: "" << std::hex << y5_x << endl;
cout << ""  y5.y: "" << std::hex << y5_y << endl;
cout << ""Key 6 (after deserialization of Key 2):"" << endl;

1- I guess that the ECDSA signature must be stored in the sent file, so that receiver can use it to verify data integrity, right?
2- I have read many times that signing should be performed on hashed data, yet the data sent with ECIES is encrypted, not hashed else how can receiver retrieve it?

However, it seems that lots of libraries

Anyone can provide me some advise? Thanks!
","You can do such thing with a library that support point multiplication.
To get your public key, you just have to multiply a generation point G by your private key.  
For example with elliptic package : 
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;

// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EC('secp256k1');

// Then generate the public point/key corresponding to your secret key.

I am trying to use Crypto++ on iOS. I downloaded a prebuilt version of the library from Marek Kotewicz's GitHub.

I'm just taking a stab in the dark. It presumes the code you showed above is really all you are doing in, say, a test ViewController.
The precompiled library appears to be using GNU's Standard C++ library. I would switch to LLVM's Standard C++ library by building Crypto++ with -stdlib=c++ (and not GNU's -stdlib=stdc++). Apple switched to it years ago, and Xcode uses it by default.
You can find a GitHub with the fat library using LLVM Standard C++ at noloader/cryptopp-5.6.2-ios.
Or, you can build the fat library yourself. For that, see iOS (Command Line) on the Crypto++ wiki. The prebuilt library at cryptopp-5.6.2-ios uses those instructions.

"49647305","Signature Algorithm sha256RSA with ECC Pubkey","Quite by chance, I ran into Google certificate. Now questions come to my mind which I haven't find answers yet:
From the certificate, it seems RSA signature algorithm is used, but the public key is an ECC key. Can we possibly do RSA encryption/decryption with an ECC key? How can we make a certificate like this using openssl? (I've created certificates of RSA SA/RSA key, ECDSA SA/ECC key, but not like this one.)
Any answer is appreciated!

","RSA signrature in the certificate means that Issuing CA (i.e. Google Internet Authority G3) used this algorithm to sign the End Entity certificate (google.com). It does not matter if the key pair was RSA or ECC.
You can not use RSA encryption with this End Entity certificate because it has ECC public key in it and AFAIK it is not possible to do encryption with ECC keys. Well, according to this wiki link you can.
If you want to make similar End entity certificate then make RSA CA then make ECC keypair and PKCS#10 request and issue the certificate using this request.

","Neardupes ECDSA signature length and how to specify signature length for java.security.Signature sign method (and more links there) 
ASN.1 DER encoding is variable size for all but certain very limited data, and in particular for ECDSA (or DSA) signatures. ECDSA_size returns the maximum length possible for the given key, but each actual signature may be either that length or shorter, depending on the binary representations of the values r and s in the signature, which for your purposes can be treated essentially as random numbers.
In cases where an actual signature is shorter than ECDSA_size you still encode the entire buffer and pass it to your Java; notice the two bytes of zero (0000 in hex) at the end of your 'failed' example? A DER decoder can ignore trailing garbage, and when I test such a case on older BouncyCastle and SunEC providers it actually works okay, but it fails for me starting at BouncyCastle 1.54 -- with a rather clear exception, 
java.security.SignatureException: error decoding signature bytes.
-- and SunEC starting at 8u121 with cause or exception similar to java.security.SignatureException: Invalid encoding for signature. 
Many implementations have recently made DER decoding stricter, after some successful attacks on 'lax' encodings, including the secp256k1 signatures in Bitcoin -- see https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/51706/what-can-be-changed-in-signed-bitcoin-transaction and https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_malleability . This is mentioned in the Oracle Java 8u121 release notes item ""More checks added to DER encoding parsing code"" although I don't see anything similar for Bouncy.
Since secp256k1 is a Certicom/X9 'prime' (Fp) curve group, its cofactor is 1 and its order is very close to the underlying field size which in turn is very close to 256 bits which is a multiple of 8, so signatures in this group will DER-encode to the maximum length (and work) almost exactly 1/4 (25%) of the time; the rest of the time they will fail.
The official and best solution is to use the updated value in the pointer, here der_copy, output by (any) i2d* routine, to determine the length of the encoding, and use that length. If you can't handle variable length for some reason, you can transmit the whole buffer but then truncate it before passing to BouncyCastle (or SunEC) by using 2+signature[1] as the valid length -- but not if you change to a curve larger than about 480 bits; above that it is different and more complicated.

Besides, I do not find any example how to use this function.

","Mathematically speaking, an ECDSA signature is a pair of two integers (r, s). The function mbedtls_ecdsa_sign_det gives you the two integers r and s as outputs and it's up to you to decide how you want to output those integers. There are two common representations of ECDSA signatures: take a fixed-size representation of r and s and put those two together, or assemble them in an ASN.1 sequence, generally in DER form (ASN.1 admits multiple representations, e.g. with or without leading zeros, and DER is a specific ASN.1 representation, without leading zeros). Bitcoin uses the DER representation. Fortunately for you, Mbed TLS has a function that directly outputs this DER representation: mbedtls_ecdsa_write_signature.
There are two variants of ECDSA: randomized and deterministic. They produce compatible signatures anyway (the deterministic variant uses a specific choice for the random parameter). mbedtls_ecdsa_write_signature uses the deterministic variant if your build supports it and the randomized variant otherwise.
Here's how a call to this function looks like. It takes the following inputs:

An ECDSA private key key.
A SHA-256 hash to sign hash.
The random number generator which you must initialize at the start of your program (not at each signature generation!). See https://tls.mbed.org/kb/how-to/generate-an-aes-key for an example.

unsigned char signature[2 * 32 + 9]; // ""at least twice as large as the size of the curve used, plus 9""

And returns Segmentation Fault. The most informative error we have gotten is perl crashed with SIGSEGV in EC_KEY_get_key_method_data()
The full code is here: https://github.com/aleitner/bitpay-perl/tree/stack-overflow-question
Is this a bug with SSL, or are we doing this wrong?
","The answer to this question is: we were calling the arguments in the wrong order.
Seriously. The line: 
$signature = key_utils::mysignMessageWithPem($pem, $message);
needed to be:
$signature = key_utils::mysignMessageWithPem($message, $pem);
We were in fact doing something wrong. I was tempted to remove the question, but maybe the answer can serve as a cautionary tale or something.

"29170086","Create keys with python and use it in .net","I try to create keys with the python package ecdsa, export it to der and use them with BouncyCastle under .Net (and vice versa).
This is my code in Python:
import base64
from ecdsa.keys import SigningKey
from ecdsa.curves import NIST521p, NIST384p, NIST256p

@classmethod
def CreateKey(self) -> SigningKey:
    privateKey = SigningKey.generate(NIST256p) 
    return privateKey

@classmethod     
def GetPublicKey(self, privateKey: SigningKey) -> str:
    publicKey = privateKey.get_verifying_key()
    der = publicKey.to_der()
    return base64.b64encode(der)

I get two strings that I want to import in .Net:

    Dim keyPriv = PrivateKeyFactory.DecryptKey({}, Base64.Decode(plainDerBase64Priv))
    Dim keyPub = PrivateKeyFactory.DecryptKey({}, Base64.Decode(plainDerBase64Pub))

But I get an exception:

            var privKey = new ECPrivateKeyParameters(privKeyStruct.GetKey(), ec);
        }
    }
}

pubKey and privKey are then ECPublicKeyParameters and ECPrivateKeyParameters that you can use with various algorithms.
Note that DER is an encoding, not really a format. For the public key, the python code is producing a SubjectPublicKeyInfo, which is the standard X.509 format for public keys.
There ought to be an option with the private key of generating a PrivateKeyInfo (or EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo using a password), both of these are formats from the PKCS#8 standard. If the python code can output one of these, then decoding the private key would be easier as just PrivateKeyFactory.CreateKey(bytes) or .DecryptKey(password, bytes).

This might not be the only option you have, but I think that you can achieve what you are looking for by creating your own EVP_PKEY_METHOD and implementing its functions as required. That way, you can store a handle to your own, for example, smart card based key and then invoke the proper sign methods at the right moment. You have to set the proper methods with the EVP_PKEY_meth_set_Xyz() functions, like EVP_PKEY_meth_set_sign(<yourSigningFunction>). For example, if you were using the Windows crypto API, you would have to invoke NCryptSignHash() from your signing function. That way, you do not have to export the private key from the Windows key store to obtain a signature.
I have done this before and the only big thing I ran into (apart from lack of documentation and examples) was a missing key store functionality at the EVP level. There seems to be some work in progress as you can see here. As a work around, I had to select keys/certificates from the a store as part of the key generation mechanism and it is not really intended for that.
If you decide to go this route, then be prepared for a few weeks of trial and error.

","Here is how you can by-pass openssl validation rules by providing an EC_KEY with a public key set equal to that of public cert and the private key set to any non-zero value (in my example I've just set it equal to the X coordinate of the public key). After the key is created and stored in a file, it can be passed as a regular private key to SSL_Context. 
I think, idealistically openssl should address this issue in a more systematic and transparent way, but until it's done, the suggested solution can be used as a work around:

#include <stdio.h>

            {
                Logger.getLogger(CardManager.class.getName()).log(Level.INFO, ""verificato"");
            }
        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException | NoSuchProviderException | InvalidKeySpecException | InvalidKeyException | SignatureException ex) {
            Logger.getLogger(""test"").log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);
        }
    } 

I Expected to have the b equals true (or false) but instead I get the following exception:
_java.security.SignatureException: error decoding signature bytes.
    at org.bouncycastle.jcajce.provider.asymmetric.util.DSABase.engineVerify(DSABase.java:80)
    at java.security.Signature$Delegate.engineVerify(Signature.java:1223)
    at java.security.Signature.verify(Signature.java:656)_

","Reason for the Exception
As already mentioned in the comments to the question, the length of the signature differs from the expected length.
The exception happens, since a DER encoded signature with 70 bytes is expected, but your CertSign contains only 64 bytes. 
Assumptions
Since it is 64 bytes, one could assume that it is an ECDSA signature consisting of two concatenated BigInteger numbers with 32 bytes each.  
Conversion of ECDSA signature to DER encoded signature
To convert that to a DER encoded signature one can use sth like:
private byte[] DEREncodeSignature(byte [] signature) throws IOException {
    BigInteger r = new BigInteger(1, Arrays.copyOfRange(signature, 0, 32));
    BigInteger s = new BigInteger(1, Arrays.copyOfRange(signature, 32, 64));
    ASN1EncodableVector v = new ASN1EncodableVector();
    v.add(new ASN1Integer(r));
    v.add(new ASN1Integer(s));
    return new DERSequence(v).getEncoded(ASN1Encoding.DER);
}

Then the lines in your code where you use the signature needs to be adjusted, e.g. to sth like this:
    boolean b = sig.verify(DEREncodeSignature(CertSign));
    if (b) {
        Logger.getLogger(CardManager.class.getName()).log(Level.INFO, ""verificato"");
    }
    else {
        Logger.getLogger(CardManager.class.getName()).log(Level.INFO, ""controllo fallito"");
    }

Quick Test
The exception is then gone, the output in the debug console looks like this:
May 11, 2019 5:09:48 PM CardManager test
INFO: controllo fallito

So the verification actually fails, but you mention that you expect b to be either true or false, so maybe it's the right result. But without having more data this is not possible to validate. 
Further Tests
I also quickly tried different signature algorithms with your code. For each of them one gets a false. 
String[] signatureAlgorithms = new String[] {""RIPEMD160withECDSA"", ""SHA224withECDDSA"", ""SHA256withECDDSA"", ""SHA384withECDDSA"", ""SHA512withECDDSA"", ""SHA1withECDSA"", ""NONEwithECDSA"", ""SHA224withECDSA"", ""SHA256withECDSA"", ""SHA384withECDSA"", ""SHA512withECDSA"", ""SHA3-224withECDSA"", ""SHA3-256withECDSA"", ""SHA3-384withECDSA"", ""SHA3-512withECDSA""};
for(String algorithm : signatureAlgorithms) {
    Signature sig;
    Logger.getLogger(CardManager.class.getName()).log(Level.INFO, ""trying aloorithm "" + algorithm + "": "");
    sig = Signature.getInstance(algorithm, ""BC"");
    ...

Still - without further data (e.g. used signature algorithm etc.) it is difficult to say what the reason for the mismatch is. 
Use Different Test Data
To verify that the routines including the new DEREncodeSignature is working correctly I signed the message 'Hello world!' with ECDSA generator using the brainpoolP256r1 parameter spec and SHA256withECDDSA signature algorithm, then the data looks like this: 
byte[] CertBody = new byte[]{(byte) 0x48,

byte[] PublicPoint = new byte[]{

        (byte) 0x15, (byte) 0x76, (byte) 0x48,
        (byte) 0xE7
};

If that data is taken and run through the routines incl. DEREncodeSignature then the following output is shown in the debug console:
May 12, 2019 12:13:42 AM CardManager test
INFO: verificato

(using sig = Signature.getInstance(""SHA256withECDDSA"", ""BC""); of course)
This means that for ECDSA generated data with brainpoolP256r1 parameter spec and SHA256withECDDSA it would work with the alternative test data.

we are using 112bit prime curve order: 4451685225093714776491891542548933
I have calculated 1 million signatures using the following method:
public void GenerateSignature()

    //curve order
    BigInteger n = ec.N;

    Ramdom rand = new Random();

    //private key
    BigInteger d = ((ECPrivateKeyParameters)key).D;

    //loop for 1 million signatures
    for (int i = 1; i <= 1000000; i++)
    {
        //random k and e
        BigInteger e = new BigInteger(112, rand).Mod(n);        //new biginteger by giving bitlength and random
        BigInteger k = new BigInteger(112, rand).Mod(n);

        //calculate r
        BigInteger r = key.Parameters.G.Multiply(k).X.ToBigInteger().Mod(n);

        //calculate s
        BigInteger s = k.ModInverse(n).Multiply(e.Add(d.Multiply(r))).Mod(n);

        //save generated signatures to database
        new DBCon().ExecuteNonQuery(""Insert into signatures values ('"" + e.ToString() + ""', '"" + r.ToString() + ""', '"" + s.ToString() + ""')"");
    }   
}

I am using BouncyCastle crypto library with C#.
I know private key can be calculated if k values is known by d = (sk - e) / r
I also know private key can be calculated if two signatures have identical r value then we can calculate k by k = (e1 - e2) / (s1 - s2) and then d by using above formula.
I also know that private key can be calculated if some bits of k are known using about 100 signatures with lattice attacks, but in this case bits of k are unknown.
any help will be appreciated.
Thanks.

I want to sign with ruby code like following.
require 'ecdsa'
def sign(str)
    digest = Digest::SHA256.digest(str) 
    temp_key = str.size 
    signature = ECDSA.sign($group, $private_key, digest, temp_key)
end

I want to know how to code for reading PEM private key file and using to sign.
","To parse your key stored in PEM format, you can use the openssl module: sudo gem install openssl
Using this module, you will extract the private key this way: OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new(pemcontent).private_key
Note that your private key is based on the secp256k1 elliptic curve:
% openssl ec -text 2>&1 << EOF | grep OID
-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
MHQCAQEEIBAFWFAlCWPb8IvM4yHLLKBIN/mEJU9cZnM5JD2U2EmAoAcGBSuBBAAK

QkydMeOciHyvvyU0gf81UW9udef2nA==
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
EOF
ASN1 OID: secp256k1

Therefore, the first parameter to give to EDSA.sign() must be ECDSA::Group::Secp256k1. This is an object that contains the parameters that define this curve.
Finally, here is your code, on which I've made the changes needed to make it work:
require 'ecdsa'
require 'openssl'

def sign(str)
  pemcontent = ""-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
MHQCAQEEIBAFWFAlCWPb8IvM4yHLLKBIN/mEJU9cZnM5JD2U2EmAoAcGBSuBBAAK

-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----""
  digest = Digest::SHA256.digest(str)
  temp_key = str.size
  signature = ECDSA.sign(ECDSA::Group::Secp256k1, OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new(pemcontent).private_key, digest, temp_key)
  return signature
end

Note: the value of temp_key should be generated with a more random way than using the length of the message to sign, like you did in your example code (it is a very very bad idea since soon or later, you will sign two messages with the same length, and this could let your private key been discovered).

"46730753","How to change the key length of ECDSA?","Recently, I was trying to do something with the code of ECDSA.  I want to change the key length of it but in vain. I checked the internet and found some source code of ECDSA, but somehow it only allows 32 bytes.
For example, I found this:
var crypto = require(""crypto"");
var eccrypto = require(""eccrypto"");     

// A new random 32-byte private key.
var privateKey = crypto.randomBytes(32);

// Corresponding uncompressed (65-byte) public key.
var publicKey = eccrypto.getPublic(privateKey);

var str = ""message to sign"";

// Always hash you message to sign!    
var msg = crypto.createHash(""sha256"").update(str).digest();

eccrypto.sign(privateKey, msg).then(function(sig) {
   console.log(""Signature in DER format:"", sig);
   eccrypto.verify(publicKey, msg, sig).then(function() {    
      console.log(""Signature is OK"");
   }).catch(function() {    
      console.log(""Signature is BAD"");
   });
});

from this website. I tried to change the privateKey from 32 bytes to 16 bytes and other values. It ended up giving me errors.
Recently I discovered that to have different key length you need different curves. Does anybody know how to change the curve in the above code? If not, would someone provide source code that can use different key lengths of ECDSA?
(I'm quite new to ECC, so if I used wrong terms or I completely misunderstood the concept of it, please forgive).
","According to https://github.com/bitchan/eccrypto#implementation-details (which looks like the right library for your code) the library only supports the secp256k1 curve.
Most other libraries, if given no context other than the curve being a 256-bit curvespace, will assume it is secp256r1 (r instead of k), meaning that the library you chose doesn't interoperate with a lot of libraries.  (For example, Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 cannot do secp256k1 using the OS-provided cryptographic libraries)
So for ""how do I use a different sized key with this library?"" the answer is ""you can't, sorry"".  And for ""what library can I use, then?"" the answer is ""sorry, that's outside the scope of StackOverflow"".

","Answering my own question just to close it, I found the reason why I was not being authenticated by the JS side. All my methods to create and replicate the Public/Private keys are working. My code for transforming ASN1 DER signature to R||S value are working aswell.
I was signing transactions on top of the Hash String, like I tought the browser did. It turns out the browser were not signing the raw hash string, but he did this with the hash string before signing:
async sign(msg) {
    const encoder = new TextEncoder('utf-8');
    const msgBuffer = encoder.encode(msg.toString());
    const signedBuffer = await ECDSA.sign(this.keys.privateKey, msgBuffer);
    const signedArray = Array.from(new Uint8Array(signedBuffer));
    return Encryption.byteToHexString(signedArray);
}

note the lines:
As it turns out, the browser was encoding the hash string to UTF-8 and signing that byte array of size 64 and not the string which would have 20 or so bytes. So before when the browser tried to verify my signature, it actually did the same thing with my hash string, converted to UTF-8 and thats why my signature was failing, because I was not signing the same message as the browser was trying to verify.
If I did this dive into the JS cove more carefully it could have saved me like 2 days.
Thanks Maarten Bodewes for trying to help me, you actually pointed out a few flaws in my code and sorry for my lack of JS-side code that I presented to you, you could probably spot this issue and helped me 2 days ago.

However it still fails to validate the signature. Hope it makes it a bit clearer.
","part of your problem is that g is actually not a number but a point
this is a rough translation of what you wrote:

k = <random number>
r = k*g%p%n
e = sha(m)

ki = k^-1%n
pr = privateKey*r

i wrote an implmentation of this however over the last few weeks something like this:

it might help you to understand how the point multiplication works check out these links:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-js-ec-math
https://eng.paxos.com/blockchain-101-foundational-math
also perhaps take a look at my simple-js-ecdsa implementation as well
just another note, you likely should not use sha1 as it is consider ""officially insecure"" and there are formulas for collisions using it. perhaps try sha2 or sha3

I pass the byte array I obtain from C++ to the following function in java which expects the byte array to be in an X.509 encoded format.
public static PublicKey getPublicKey(byte[] pk) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException {
    EncodedKeySpec publicKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(pk);
    KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(Constant.KEY_FACTORY_TYPE);
    PublicKey pub = kf.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);
    return pub;
}

I create an elliptic curve key pair using the following function which retuns an EC_KEY*
EC_KEY* generate_keypair() {
    EC_KEY *eckey = EC_KEY_new();
    EC_GROUP *ecgroup = EC_GROUP_new_by_curve_name(NID_X9_62_prime256v1);

    if (kpGenerationStatus) {
        return eckey;
    }
    return nullptr;
}

Given the keypair returned by the function above, I want to export the public key to an ASN1.DER format which can be imported using the java method above.
I convert the public key which is of type EC_POINT* to its hex form using EC_POINT_point2hex() by doing the following:
EC_GROUP *ecgroup = EC_GROUP_new_by_curve_name(NID_X9_62_prime256v1);
EC_KEY *keypair = generate_keypair();
char *result = NULL;
BN_CTX *ctx;
ctx = BN_CTX_new();
const EC_POINT *pub = EC_KEY_get0_public_key(keypair);
result = EC_POINT_point2hex(ecgroup, pub, POINT_CONVERSION_UNCOMPRESSED, ctx);
printf(""%s\n"", result);

Which return the following:
04F588CD1D7103A993D47E53D58C3F40BE8F570604CF2EA01A7657C1423EB19C51BC379F0BEE1FAA60BB9A07DE73EA9BEF7709C1C6429D4051B44F73A458FFB80D
When I inspect this with the ASN.1 decoder I see a message which says Length over 48 bits not supported at position 1 and trying to import it using the java method I receive an error as follows:
java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException: java.security.InvalidKeyException: IOException: DerInputStream.getLength(): Should use short form for length

Is there something I am missing while exporting the public key from EC_POINT* to a X.509 Encoded hex string that I can import for validating any signatures?
","You are going in the incorrect direction as you want ASN1 base64 value.  
EC_POINT_point2hex is converting the internal public key value to hex.  It's not in ASN1 format.
You can produce what you want from the command line like so:

Generate EC private key:
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out key.pem
Extra public key in DER(ASN1) format:
openssl ec -in key.pem -pubout -outform der -out public.cer
Convert to base64
openssl base64 -in .\public.cer

If you take that output and paste it into ASN.1 decoder link it works fine.
Now to turn this into code, you have the EC key generation, but what you want is the steps to:

Generate ASN1 formatted public key
Convert it to base64

To generate the ASN1 formatted public key you want to use the i2d_EC_PUBKEY set of methods and then convert to base64 using BIO_f_base64 filter.
So here is an example problem that when I copy the output to ASN.1 decoder link it works fine.
#include <openssl/bio.h>
#include <openssl/ec.h>
#include <openssl/evp.h>
#include <openssl/x509.h>

EC_KEY* generate_keypair() {
    EC_KEY *eckey = EC_KEY_new();
    EC_GROUP *ecgroup = EC_GROUP_new_by_curve_name(NID_X9_62_prime256v1);
    EC_KEY_set_group(eckey, ecgroup);
    EC_KEY_set_asn1_flag(eckey, OPENSSL_EC_NAMED_CURVE);
    int kpGenerationStatus = EC_KEY_generate_key(eckey);
    if (kpGenerationStatus) {
        return eckey;
    }
    return nullptr;
}

int main()
{
    EC_GROUP *ecgroup = EC_GROUP_new_by_curve_name(NID_X9_62_prime256v1);
    EC_KEY *keypair = generate_keypair();
    BIO* out = BIO_new(BIO_s_mem());
    BIO* b64 = BIO_new(BIO_f_base64());
    BIO_push(b64, out);

    i2d_EC_PUBKEY_bio(b64, keypair);

    BIO_flush(b64);


    // do what you want this the output in out memory BIO

    char* p;
    long length = BIO_get_mem_data(out, &p);

    // ensure null terminated but copying the buffer into a string to output...
    puts(std::string(p, length).c_str());

    BIO_free_all(out);
}

I can't complete on the Java side, but if it works with the manual openssl generated base64 string then it will work with the sample application.

Here is how Bouncy Castle code performs ECDSA digital signature verification.
private BigInteger calculateE(BigInteger n, byte[] message)
{
    /* n is curve order value */
    int log2n = n.bitLength();
    /* and message is a hash */
    int messageBitLength = message.length * 8;

    BigInteger e = new BigInteger(1, message);
    /* If message is longer than curve order */
    if (log2n < messageBitLength)
    {
        /* only log2n bits are taken from the left */
        e = e.shiftRight(messageBitLength - log2n);
    }
    return e;
}

"50592110","Converting a hex String to x509 encoding","I'm working with some Android Java code that uses ECDSA keys. The code compiles and runs fine, but has some logic errors during the verification process. I want to try using a constant key pair (that's known to be valid) to troubleshoot the program.
Using an online generator, I got an EC public key in hex,

0x044fb7cebbb1f4a1e0412c8e0b6f2d675ebfee000c5e860a81ffd795b5743033dec0e114abfba3de8db8705fc8ed985c5550c66a6ee9fdd258d058a2ef749eba78

As well as a valid private key to complete the pair,

0x0c84e7e707b31ecf0254e8cb3040513883d92d81e977ad4754a409a6ab18ee51

I can convert the hex string to a primitive byte array, but that byte array appears to be invalid. I cannot figure out how to convert a hex representation of my keys to a X509 representation so that I can make a Java key object.
KeyFactory mFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""EC"");
X509EncodedKeySpec mPublicKey = new X509EncodedKeySpec(publicKeyBytes);
PublicKey publicKey = mFactory.generatePublic(mPublicKey);

That code results in:
java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException: com.android.org.conscrypt.OpenSSLX509CertificateFactory$ParsingException: Error parsing public key

I am reasonably sure that my conversion from hex string to byte array is working, but I'll include that method as well for a sanity check.
private static byte[] hexStringToByteArray(String s) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    int len = s.length();
    if (len % 2 == 1) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Hex string must have even number of characters"");
    }
    byte[] data = new byte[len / 2]; // Allocate 1 byte per 2 hex characters
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i += 2) {
        // Convert each character into a integer (base-16), then bit-shift into place
        data[i / 2] = (byte) ((Character.digit(s.charAt(i), 16) << 4)
                + Character.digit(s.charAt(i+1), 16));
    }
    return data;
}

The end goal is to have a constant, valid PublicKey/PrivateKey object for testing. Any advice about how to generate those objects would be greatly appreciated.

"50971023","ECDSA key size difference between OpenSSL and BouncyCastle","I am implementing a 192 bit ECDSA signature in C# using BouncyCastle.  It was specified in text by my customer.  They sent me a spec in OpenSSL after I started implementing in BouncyCastle.  Now I'm having trouble moving keys between OpenSSL and BouncyCastle.  I think I must be missing the point of something, and am asking your help to understand how ECDSA 192 works across the two libraries.
The first line of the spec is:

openssl ecparam -name secp192r1 -genkey -noout -out priv.pem

The resulting priv.pem contains a Base64 string that decodes to 97 bytes.  When I feed that key to BouncyCastle using a 192 bit curve, I get exceptions.
ECDomainParameters spec = GetEcdsaCurveParamsForInit();
// D is the Private Key
BigInteger d = new BigInteger(tbSigKeyHex.Text, 16);
ECPrivateKeyParameters sKey = new ECPrivateKeyParameters(""ECDSA"", d, spec);
ECPublicKeyParameters vKey = GL_ECKeyPairGenerator.GetCorrespondingPublicKey(sKey); // EXCEPT on d > 24byte max value

The specific exception is System.InvalidOperationException on this line of EcKeyPairGenerator.cs:

ECPoint q = new FixedPointCombMultiplier().Multiply(ec.G, privKey.D);

If I truncate the Ascii-hex input string to 48 bytes, so privKey.D is never more than the max value of 24 bytes, everything runs ok.  But now my code differs from spec.
I also notice that BouncyCastle makes 24 byte keys with 192 bit curves:
AsymmetricCipherKeyPair keyPair = GenerateKeys(192); // bit length selects curve in GL_ECKeyPairGenerator
ECPrivateKeyParameters sKey = (ECPrivateKeyParameters)keyPair.Private;
string szD = sKey.D.ToString(16);
PrintToFeedback(string.Format(""Generated Private D Key {0} bytes: {1}"", szD.Length/2, szD));
ECPublicKeyParameters vKey = (ECPublicKeyParameters)keyPair.Public;

prints out:

Generated Private D Key 24 bytes: 92e67f4a42c3031349f7e88d082a8e1f122eaee8d8b0823d

When I break and inspect sKey, I don't see anything that looks like a 97 byte number.  I see how 24 bytes maps to 192 bits, but not 97.  Since my customer says OpenSSL is the spec, I have to assume that's correct.  But I'm a little lost.  Before they sent me the OpenSSL spec, I had convinced myself that ECDSA192 uses 24 byte private keys (and 48 byte public keys, more or less), but this 97 byte OpenSSL key throws everything into doubt again.  My expertise is in realtime and RFID, not so much crypto.
Can someone help me understand how to use the OpenSSL 97 byte key with BouncyCastle?  Or should I just rip up BouncyCastle and rewrite with OpenSSL.Net?
I am running in a Cygwin bash window under Win10, openssl version is:

OpenSSL 1.0.2o  27 Mar 2018

Thank you.
","The file priv.pem that results from your openssl ecparam command contains more than just the bytes that make up the private part of the key. In particular, it also includes the public part of the key pair, and some information about what kind of curve the key is on. You can see this when you do

If the signature r and s are positive, it works well, but if either of them is negative, an assertion error raises. I have checked the ecdsa sourcecode, and I saw this line:
nbytes = numberbytes[0] if isinstance(numberbytes[0], integer_types) else ord(numberbytes[0])
assert nbytes < 0x80 # can't support negative numbers yet

Sorry, I missed the last step. This seems to be a bug in the OTP code. The der_decode/2 function is called with KeyType set to ECPoint, see the pem_entry_decode/1 function. But der_decode/2 expects Asn1Type. Calling the 'OTP-PUB-KEY' module directly seems to be working:

However I am not sure if it returns anything sensible. Maybe worth raising a bug in OTP with the code that you posted in this question as steps to reproduce. Then at least someone competent would verify why it doesn't work. I am sure the steps you followed are fine and the types returned and passed to further functions are OK as far as the documentation is concerned.

we can see next :

gives us
{ok,{namedCurve,{1,3,132,0,10}}}

and
pubkey_cert_records:namedCurves({1,3,132,0,10}).

gives us our source curve  - secp256k1, and 
 subjectPublicKey = <<4,241,200,19,168,25,25,81,43,216,

is public key itself. But this is workaround how I said before.

var my_hash = my_hash_word_array.toString();

console.log('hash equals:',tests.source.hash == my_hash);

I can that in this case it's equal!

var key = ecc.keyFromPublic(tests.ec.keys.public_key_compressed, 'hex'); // <<< problem line
console.log('signOk:', key.verify(my_hash, tests.source.hash_signed));

The result is ""signOk: false"", why? What am I doing wrong? 
","I've spent quite some time trying to track this down, and I'm pretty sure your issue has to do with the key encoding:
var key = ecc.keyFromPublic(tests.ec.keys.public_key_compressed, 'hex');

Looking at your loaded values:

public_key_compressed is not in Hexadecimal encoding (hint: doesn't start with ""0x"")
You should make sure to encode this value as Hexadecimal and try again.

Since ECDH can not avoid MITM attach, therefore ECDSA is used to verify the entity. So ECDSA should run before ECDH ?
Or it doens't matter at all?
","
Since ECDH can not avoid MITM attack

First, here is one of the many ways you could solve this difficulty using RSA instead of DSA (or ECDSA): the client, before sending its ECDH (or DH) public key on the wire, could encrypt this ECDH (or DH) public key with the public RSA key of the server. And this way, the server is the only peer that knows the client ECDH key. Therefore, both sides are protected against man in the middle attacks. Of course, using RSA to encrypt another key may need OAEP.

Or it doens't matter at all?

In your case, using ECDSA instead of RSA, you can not encrypt anything. So you need to have mutual authentication in the protocol you will design: your server and your client must have previously exchanged their public ECDSA keys or must have some kind of PKI with some kind of root certificate to authenticate the remote public ECDSA key. Finally, the client and the server just need to follow those steps, in this order:

sign their ECDH public key with their ECDSA private key,
send this information to the other host,
receive this information from the other host,
check the signature,
if the check failed, stop talking,
if the signature is correctly checked, perform the end of the DH algorithm.

Here's the back story...
According to curve25519's A state-of-the-art Diffie-Hellman function, the source code for the curve is at SUPERCOP. SUPERCOP is a benchmarking program for cryptographic algorithms.
We have curve25519 and ed25519 on a testing fork. We ripped the implementation from SUPERCOP. SUPERCOP has the optimized reference implementations of curve25519, curve448, and lots of other stuff. Once curve25519 and ed25519 were added we planned on curve448.
We added curve25519 based on Andrew Moon's implementation. That provides x25519 and ed25519. Also see Issue 761 (x25519) and Issue 764 (ed25519).
At this point the Crypto++ implementations of curve448 are stalled. I think your options are roll your own based on SUPERCOP, or use a library like libsodium, Botan or OpenSSL.

The .HasPrivateKey() method returns true, which I've read can return a false positive.  
When I add my certificates to the store, I can verify the cert chain.

        var chainBuilt = chain.Build(result.Certificate);

        if (!chainBuilt)

            }
        }

        Assert.IsTrue(chainBuilt, ""Chain"");
    }

I thought at first that maybe the private cert had to come from the cert store, so I imported it and then pulled it back out, but I get the same error, which is another reason I believe I'm not doing something quite right.
EDIT:
I have another class generating RSA x509's using the same code for putting the private key into the certificate.  It allows me to export the RSA private key.  
The variable _keyStrength is 384 and my signature factory is using ""SHA256withECDSA"".  I have also tried using ""SHA384withECDSA"" but I get the same error.
","OK. It's a blind shot but after looking at your code I noticed two things:

When you create PFX you set null password. But when you load the PFX into X509Certificate2 class you are using wrong constructor. You should use one with a password parameter and give a null into it
When you load PFX into X509Certificate2 class you do not specify, if the private key should be exportable. I think that this is the reason why privateKey.ExportParameters(true) gives you an exception. You should use this constructor and specify null as password


Made it working
I thought it was a bug. It's possible that it is. We clearly stated in X509Constructor that the private key should be exportable. I used X509KeyStorageFlags.EphemeralKeySet | X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable flags too. But when I looked at the CngKey it had ExportPolicy set to AllowExport but not AllowPlaintextExport. 
It was exportable in some way. privateKey.Key.Export(CngKeyBlobFormat.OpaqueTransportBlob) worked. But privateKey.ExportParameters(true) did not.
I've searched for a solution how to change ExportPolicy of CngKey. I found this SO question that helped me to change it. After that the ExportParameters worked.
The fixed version of your GetDerivedKey method is
private byte[] GetDerivedKey(X509Certificate2 publicCertificate, X509Certificate2 privateCertificate)

    byte[] derivedKey;

        myPrivateKeyToMessWith.Key.SetProperty(pty);

Because this is a self signed certificate that I am generating, I assume I am doing something wrong.
I first create a root CA certificate and pass in the private key to sign my certificate.
private X509Certificate2 CreateECSDACertificate(string certificateName,
        string issuerCertificateName,
        TimeSpan lifetime,
        AsymmetricKeyParameter issuerPrivateKey,
        string certificateFriendlyName = null)
    {
        // Generating Random Numbers
        var randomGenerator = new CryptoApiRandomGenerator();
        var random = new SecureRandom(randomGenerator);

        var signatureFactory = new Asn1SignatureFactory(""SHA256WithECDSA"", issuerPrivateKey, random);

        // The Certificate Generator
        var certificateGenerator = new X509V3CertificateGenerator();

        // Serial Number
        var serialNumber = BigIntegers.CreateRandomInRange(BigInteger.One, BigInteger.ValueOf(Int64.MaxValue), random);
        certificateGenerator.SetSerialNumber(serialNumber);

        // Issuer and Subject Name
        var subjectDistinguishedName = new X509Name($""CN={certificateName}"");
        var issuerDistinguishedName = new X509Name($""CN={issuerCertificateName}"");
        certificateGenerator.SetSubjectDN(subjectDistinguishedName);
        certificateGenerator.SetIssuerDN(issuerDistinguishedName);

        // Valid For
        var notBefore = DateTime.UtcNow.Date;
        var notAfter = notBefore.Add(lifetime);

        certificateGenerator.SetNotBefore(notBefore);
        certificateGenerator.SetNotAfter(notAfter);

        //key generation
        var keyGenerationParameters = new KeyGenerationParameters(random, _keyStrength);
        var keyPairGenerator = new ECKeyPairGenerator();
        keyPairGenerator.Init(keyGenerationParameters);
        var subjectKeyPair = keyPairGenerator.GenerateKeyPair();

        certificateGenerator.SetPublicKey(subjectKeyPair.Public);

        var certificate = certificateGenerator.Generate(signatureFactory);

        var store = new Pkcs12Store();
        var certificateEntry = new X509CertificateEntry(certificate);
        store.SetCertificateEntry(certificateName, certificateEntry);
        store.SetKeyEntry(certificateName, new AsymmetricKeyEntry(subjectKeyPair.Private), new[] { certificateEntry });

        X509Certificate2 x509;

        using (var pfxStream = new MemoryStream())
        {
            store.Save(pfxStream, null, new SecureRandom());
            pfxStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
            x509 = new X509Certificate2(pfxStream.ToArray());
        }

        x509.FriendlyName = certificateFriendlyName;

        return x509;
    }

The .HasPrivateKey() method returns true, which I've read can return a false positive.  
When I add my certificates to the store, I can verify the cert chain.
    [Test]
    public void CreateSelfSignedCertificate_AfterAddingToStore_CanBuildChain()
    {
        var result = _target.CreateSelfSignedCertificate(_subject, _issuer, TimeSpan.FromDays(356), _certificateFriendlyName, _issuerFriendlyName);

        _store.TryAddCertificateToStore(result.CertificateAuthority, _caStoreName, _location);
        _store.TryAddCertificateToStore(result.Certificate, _certStoreName, _location);

        var chain = new X509Chain
        {
            ChainPolicy =
            {
                RevocationMode = X509RevocationMode.NoCheck
            }
        };

        var chainBuilt = chain.Build(result.Certificate);

        if (!chainBuilt)
        {
            foreach (var status in chain.ChainStatus)
            {
                Assert.Warn(string.Format(""Chain error: {0} {1}"", status.Status, status.StatusInformation));
            }
        }

        Assert.IsTrue(chainBuilt, ""Chain"");
    }

I thought at first that maybe the private cert had to come from the cert store, so I imported it and then pulled it back out, but I get the same error, which is another reason I believe I'm not doing something quite right.
EDIT:
I have another class generating RSA x509's using the same code for putting the private key into the certificate.  It allows me to export the RSA private key.  
The variable _keyStrength is 384 and my signature factory is using ""SHA256withECDSA"".  I have also tried using ""SHA384withECDSA"" but I get the same error.
","I started using the solution @pepo posted which lead me to discover 'GetECDsaPrivateKey' does not return an ECDsa object but an ECDsaCng.  I simplified the key derivation to this.
byte[] derivedKey;

using (var privateKey = (ECDsaCng)certificate.GetECDsaPrivateKey())
using (var publicKey = (ECDsaCng)certificate.GetECDsaPublicKey())
{
    var publicParams = publicKey.ExportParameters(false);

    using (var publicCng = ECDiffieHellmanCng.Create(publicParams))
    using (var diffieHellman = new ECDiffieHellmanCng(privateKey.Key))
    {
        derivedKey = diffieHellman.DeriveKeyMaterial(publicCng.PublicKey);
    }
}

return derivedKey;

As usual for MS the reason for the failure is not detailed enough to fix the issue. Is there any way to find out which of the approximately 70 tags in the certificate is invalid?
One more piece of information: The keypair and the csr are created using bouncycastle as I did not find a way to do a cmp-request with .NET only. Could this be the reason? But why is the certificate displayed as valid in the mmc console?
Sorry for not providing a complete verifiable example but even the stripped down code for creating the csr, sending it, attaching the private key to the certificate and storing it in the MYStore is way to long and without a PKI absolutely useless.
UPDATE
The code to load the certificate from the store is as follows:
static X509Certificate2 LoadFromStore(string commonName)
{
    var distinguishedName = ""CN="" + commonName;
    var store = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.CurrentUser);
    store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);

    X509Certificate2 result = null;

    foreach (var cert in store.Certificates)
    {
        if (cert.SubjectName.Name != null && cert.SubjectName.Name.Equals(distinguishedName))
        {
           Console.WriteLine(""Found certificate in local store: "" + cert.SubjectName.Name);

            result = cert;
            break;
        }
    }

    store.Close();
    return result;
}

","As usual when working with microsoft APIs the error has nothing to do with the real reason... :-(
The cause of all this was a wrong csr that made the received certificate have valid ASN1 structure (verified with http://lapo.it/asn1js/) with invalid content. How to do it right can be found in the answer to this SO question. 
User pepo helped me a lot to get on the right track (Thank you once again!). 
His comment suggesting to use certutil -user -store my instead of looking at the MMC console was the hint I needed to sort this out.

"55519943","Parse CMS base64 encrypted signature into PKCS7 file and get certs using nodejs","I'm working with apple pay token decryption and am having some difficulties with the signature verification part. Step 1 is to take the CMS base64 encoded signature, parse it to a PEM file and get the attached certificates. I saw some examples on github in other languages and it seems like I should be able to base64 decode the signature and parse it to a PKCS7 file and it should have a certificates property to get the certificates from, but I can't seem to figure out how to do that with javscript/nodejs. I've tried using node-forge and calling  forge.pkcs7.createSignedData() and then setting the content to the base64 decoded signature string, and while that does create a PKCS7 file, I can't seem to figure out how to get the certs from it. What I'm trying to do is essentially the openssl command 'openssl pkcs7 -in test.pem -inform -print_certs -out test.crt', where test.pem is the PEM file containing the PKCS7 content and test.crt is the newly created file containing the attached certificates. I think part of the reason node-forge isn't helping me too much is because from my understanding, node-forge doesn't support ECDSA, but I'm not an expert in cryptography so I may be mistaken. Can anyone help point me in the right direction or to a different npm package that can help me accomplish this? Thanks!

Anyway i2d_PublicKey is for writing out public keys in old-style ""traditional"" format. Since ED448 is a new algorithm, there is no such format defined for it. Instead you must use SubjectPublicKeyInfo format. The OpenSSL function for that is the (confusingly similar) i2d_PUBKEY(). The man page is here:

byte[] pubY = ecPub.Q.YCoord.ToBigInteger().ToByteArray();

first way, pubs[0] is always 0x04, and it make array length to 65 bytes.

seconde way, pubX[0] is sometimes 0x00, and it make array length to 65 bytes.
like this
pubX = 00 F0 9E 70 EB ED 52 4B 56 E8 64 9C 9A D9 1C 97 6F F1 92 86 BA 87 FC F5 AB E4 CC 72 C6 EA 77 FA 0D

Except for the value of index 0, the rest are the same.
Why does this difference occur?
What value do I actually use?
p.s.
I convert private key like this

priv, err := ecdsa.GenerateKey(elliptic.P256(), rand.Reader)
// get public key
pub := priv.Public()

I, however, need help on getting the raw byte data and using the correct encoding to read/write these public and private keys to files.
","Just marshal them to a []byte using x509.MarshalECPrivateKey.  You can just read and write the binary to a file.
You might find in future you want to store the keys in PEM format, as is common.  You can do that with the encoding/pem package.

"50234953","Own random (not the private key) in the ECDSA","I'm trying to debug my own implementation of the ECDSA signature. To compare the intermediate results I would like to force the OpenSSL, Crypto++ or whatever else package to use a known ""random"" number instead of generating it each time the signature is created. Is there a way to do so? 
Since I'm working with the brainpool curves I can't use the microsoft crypto API. This doesn't support the brainpool curves in the Crypto API until Windows 10.
Another way could to be retrieve the random used after the ECDSA signature creation from one of the popular packages.
I appreciate any help
","Yes, this is possible with OpenSSL. OpenSSL provides the ability to override the default source of random numbers. To do this use the RAND_set_rand_method() function documented here:
https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/crypto/RAND_set_rand_method.html
This function takes as an argument a RAND_METHOD structure which contains function pointers to the implementations of the OpenSSL random capabilities. Replace the bytes element with your own implementation.
For example
RAND_METHOD myrand, *oldrand;

oldrand = RAND_get_rand_method();
myrand = *oldrand;
myrand.bytes = mybytes;
RAND_set_rand_method(myrand);

Where mybytes is defined like this:
static int mybytes(unsigned char *buf, int num)
{
    /* Replace with however you want the random function to work */
    memset(buf, 0, num);
    return 1;
}

OpenSSL's own ecdsatest code does exactly this. For example see:
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/OpenSSL_1_1_0-stable/test/ecdsatest.c#L65

I am using Java JDK 11.
When running the CertPathValidator.getInstance(""PKIX"").validate method, I get a crash Unrecognized algorithm for signature parameters SHA256withECDSA.
The root cause seems to be the following:
// null
providerSunEC.getService(""AlgorithmParameters"", ""SHA256withECDSA"");

There is no such signature parameters, though: the X509CertImpl instance contains an AlgorithmId with algid 1.2.840.10045.4.3.2 and params OID.1.2.840.10045.3.1.7 (DER Encoded, it should be prime256v1), which should be the default and only supported one.
My feeling, which may be highly wrong, is that the redundant prime256v1 could and should be omitted but I do not know how to implement it, as it is inside the Java code.
This is the stacktrace:

"55976645","ECDSA Signature Verification Failed on Javascript(Elliptic)","I have an issue with verification of a ECDSA Signature made on javacard. I am trying to verify the signature in Javascript(Elliptic) but the verification always fails.
My applet(javacard) looks like:
//initialization
ecdsa = Signature.getInstance(Signature.ALG_ECDSA_SHA_256, false);
eccKey=SecP256k1.newKeyPair(); //in SecP256k1 the p,a,b,g,r,k are set
eccKey.genKeyPair();

//singing method
ecdsa.init(eccKey.getPrivate(), Signature.MODE_SIGN);

//Generates the signature of all input data.
short lenTmp = ecdsa.sign(buffer, ISO7816.OFFSET_CDATA, (short)1, buffer, 
(short)0);
//I tried also to sigh precomputed hash - same result
/*short lenTmp = ecdsa.signPreComputedHash(buffer, ISO7816.OFFSET_CDATA, 
len, buffer, (short)0); */

apdu.setOutgoingAndSend((short)0, lenTmp);

I get a private key 
(e.g. : 3E05E289911E66A8153EE9C15A0AFC109C49207DB9DC4656CC4D092323EA65BC)
When I sign a message (e.g : 0x01)
I get the signature in DER format:
304402205F376BB2B2D48BBB0275099C3B9591F18ECA424DD953EB27FDE37BA819B98F980220539A85B91491E977F6B31B5A76BEF6805BBC3B6481A51C23B9E7C6F39FB70569
Also its verification is successful on javacard..
But when I try to verify it on nodejs, it always fails.
My code looks like:
let elliptic = require('elliptic');
let ec = new elliptic.ec('secp256k1');
let keyPair = ec.keyFromPrivate(""3E05E289911E66A8153EE9C15A0AFC109C49207DB9DC4656CC4D092323EA65BC"");
let privKey = keyPair.getPrivate(""hex"");
let pubKey = keyPair.getPublic();
let signature = ""304402205F376BB2B2D48BBB0275099C3B9591F18ECA424DD953EB27FDE37BA819B98F980220539A85B91491E977F6B31B5A76BEF6805BBC3B6481A51C23B9E7C6F39FB70569"";
let msg = 0x01;
let validSig = ec.verify(msg, signature, pubKey);
console.log(""Signature valid?"", validSig);//returns always false

Also, if I sign the same message with the same key on nodejs, the verification is successful.
Moreover, I noticed that the signature is always different in javacard, while the signature on elliptic is always the same, maybe it always chosses the same random k.
","This is most likely caused due to the fact that standard ecdsa libraries in java/go/python/etc. generate the signature der encoded where as the javascript library simply concatenates the R and S values of the signature. Here is how I deal with this issue in my own library HERE. Sorry the example is golang to typescript, but hopefully you can reverse engineer this to java/javascript. Event within Node.js this issue exists. Here is a LINK to a discussion that ultimately helped me figure out how to breach the gap between the implementations within my own work.

I included Java code as well. I have to do the same in Swift. How to do EC Encryption using the Shared key(Shared1) to encrypt the string? I need to do Step 3. Anyone please help on this?
","First of all, you're trying to implement ECIES. Knowing the actual name is important if you want to look up information about the scheme.
So lets assume that key pair 1 is from the sender of the ciphertext and key pair 2 is then from the receiver of the ciphertext. In that case key pair 1 should be ephemeral (created on the spot, tied to one encrypted message) and key pair 2 is static (created beforehand and kept). Furthermore, public key 2 is trusted to be from the receiving party. This is all not clear from your simplified code, and in your code you could still switch around the sender and receiver.
So with the public key (2) of the receiver the sender can use their private key to create a shared secret, called shared1 in your code. You can now use shared1 to perform symmetric encryption of the data. Then you just have to send the ephemeral public key of the sender and the ciphertext to the receiver. The receiver uses the public key of the sender (1) and their static private key (2) to create shared2. This is identical to shared1 and can thus be used as a key to decrypt the data.
So that's it, other than to note that since the private key (1) of the sender is tied to the data, it isn't needed anymore once shared1 is calculated, and may be discarded even before the message is encrypted.

If you read above then you can see that having all of this in one method is not a good idea:

create the static key pair of the receiver;
send the public key of the receiver to the sender and make sure that the sender can trust the public key to be from the receiver (e.g. using certificate infrastructure);

Now for the encryption and sending:

create the key pair of the sender;
derive the symmetric key;
throw away the private key;
encrypt the data;
send the public key and the data;

and for the receiving:

use the private key to derive the symmetric key;
decrypt the data.

And that's it. You probably want to have these steps made explicit in your code.

// Saving to file...

","You are invoking the right OpenSSL methods. However, you did not explain in detail how you save the Result to file. Based on its name, TString probably behaves as a 0-terminated string. If so, then the signature will not be written to the file correctly but truncated too early whenever the it contains a 0-byte. Note that the ECDSA signing steps include a random component so the signature is different every time you run your code.
The following reasoning supports this guess and roughly explains why your code fails and succeeds as often as it does. If you read this explanation about the format of the ECDSA signature, you will see that the 0-byte is very common in such signatures. The probability is about 3/4 for the first bytes of the r and s components combined. Then there is an additional probability of 1-(255/256)^64, about 1/4, that the remaining 64 bytes will contain a 0. So the probability of failure is roughly 3/4 + 1/4*1/4, about 80%.
Your sample space is small, but with that string-mistake taken into account, 5 successes out of 21 attempts is a likely result.

marshalled, err := x509.MarshalECPrivateKey(key) // marshalls data to byte stream

Basically, what I am having trouble with has to do with the fact that when a key pair is generated, it is stored in an *ecdsa.PrivateKey, in which the public key is stored in the *ecdsa.PrivateKey.PublicKey, and when I marshall the key pair data (stored in the *ecdsa.PrivateKey) using x509.MarshalECPrivateKey(key), a single byte slice is returned. I am therefore having trouble determining which are the public and private keys in the byte slice itself.
","The private key is a superset of the public key.  It always contains the public key.  Usually a public key is stored as part of a certificate.
If you really want to get the public key by itself, you can grab the X and Y big integers from the ecdsa public key struct and store the binary representation of them.
You might benefit from a bit of retrospect on your design here.  There aren't too many situations where you need to communicate a public key alone.

The following prints FAIL and I cannot understand why:

You are close. Looking at the wiki page there are a few problems. First, this is undefined behavior (it has been fixed on the wiki):
auto signature_length = signer.SignMessage(
    prng, (const byte*)message.data(),
    message.size(), (byte*)signature.data());

To get the non-const pointer you need this instead (but it is not the cause of your issue):
auto signature_length = signer.SignMessage(
    prng, (const byte*)&message[0],
    message.size(), (byte*)&signature[0]);

Second, when you call Initialize twice you whack the old configuration. ""Whack"" means you generate new parameters. Effectively you overwrote the other private key:
private_key.Initialize( prng, ASN1::secp160r1() );
...
signer.AccessKey().Initialize(prng, ASN1::secp160r1());

It is not readily apparent, but the Initialize that takes a prng generates a new key. You want an Initialize that does not take a prng:
private_key.Initialize( prng, ASN1::secp160r1() );
...
signer.AccessKey().Initialize(private_key);

Third, the page is not clear how to move between Signers/Verifiers and PublicKey/PrivateKey. Here are some other ways to do it for illustration purposes:
cryptopp $ cat test.cxx
#include ""eccrypto.h""
#include ""oids.h""
#include ""osrng.h""
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    using namespace CryptoPP;
    AutoSeededRandomPool prng;

    ECDSA<ECP, SHA256>::Signer signer;
    ECDSA<ECP, SHA256>::Verifier verifier;

    signer.AccessKey().Initialize(prng, ASN1::secp160r1());
    signer.AccessKey().MakePublicKey(verifier.AccessKey());

    std::string signature(signer.MaxSignatureLength(), 0);
    std::string message = ""asdf"";

    auto signature_length = signer.SignMessage(
        prng, (const byte*)&message[0],
        message.size(), (byte*)&signature[0]);
    signature.resize(signature_length);

    bool verified = verifier.VerifyMessage(
        (const byte*)&message[0], message.size(),
        (const byte*)&signature[0], signature.size());

    if (verified)
        std::cout << ""PASS"" << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << ""FAIL"" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

I'm working from Crypto++ directory so the includes and command line are a little different:
cryptopp$ g++ -I . test.cxx ./libcryptopp.a -o test.exe
cryptopp$ ./test.exe
PASS


If you want to use both Signers/Verifiers and PublicKey/PrivateKey then try something like:
cryptopp$ cat test.cxx
#include ""eccrypto.h""
#include ""oids.h""
#include ""osrng.h""
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    using namespace CryptoPP;
    AutoSeededRandomPool prng;

    ECDSA<ECP, SHA256>::Signer signer;
    ECDSA<ECP, SHA256>::Verifier verifier;

    ECDSA<ECP, SHA256>::PrivateKey& sKey = signer.AccessKey();
    sKey.Initialize(prng, ASN1::secp160r1());
    ECDSA<ECP, SHA256>::PublicKey& pKey = verifier.AccessKey();
    sKey.MakePublicKey(pKey);

    std::string signature(signer.MaxSignatureLength(), 0);
    std::string message = ""asdf"";

    auto signature_length = signer.SignMessage(
        prng, (const byte*)&message[0],
        message.size(), (byte*)&signature[0]);
    signature.resize(signature_length);

    bool verified = verifier.VerifyMessage(
        (const byte*)&message[0], message.size(),
        (const byte*)&signature[0], signature.size());

    if (verified)
        std::cout << ""PASS"" << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << ""FAIL"" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}


This looks a little unusual:
ECDSA<ECP, SHA256>::Signer signer;
...
signer.AccessKey().Initialize(prng, ASN1::secp160r1());

Typically you use {secp160r1, SHA1} or {secp256k1, SHA256}. That maintains the Security Levels of the system as a whole. When you use {secp160r1, SHA256} you are reducing the security level to about 80-bits because of secp160r1.

I could verify the signature 86 times and other 14 times the verification failed. Any idea what could be missing.

","The SHA256 hashes of all signatures whose verification fails contain one or more 0x00 values.
Example:
Random number: 71953998552024151452665049464440435681055869491222530611033199

0x00 values occur at index positions 9 and 27.
When ECDSA_do_verify is called in the verify_signature-method, strlen((const char*)hash) is passed as 2nd parameter. This expression calculates the length up to the first 0x00 value (exclusive). Therefore, only part of the hash is used for verification and verification fails.
The problem can easily be solved by replacing strlen((const char*)hash) with SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH because a SHA256 hash has a fixed length (of 32 bytes).

","The way TLS is designed is there is only a single method for server authentication within a TLS handshake. This is just because of protocol design and not because of cryptographic reasons. ECDSA is one way to authenticate the server (using certificates with ECC key), RSA is another (using certificates with RSA key) and PSK is yet another one. The same way you cannot combine ECDSA and RSA based authentication you cannot combine ECDSA and PSK.

Despite being a raw PHP noob (C and Erlang are my languages,) I have managed to put together a few classes that successfully authenticates with an iCloud container using server-to-server keys registered in that container through the iCloud dashboard.

"57872901","How to get signature length from signature body in Crypto++ ECDSA","I use Crypto++ (libcrypto++ 1.11) to embed JWT in my application. I made methods to sign and verify messages with CryptoPP::ECDSA<CryptoPP::ECP, CryptoPP::SHA256> algorithm (with secp256r1 curve). Tokens for verification can come from the outer world, so I need to verify token contents (textual data) signature knowing the public key.
The problem is that Crypto++ can cause SegFault on invalid signatures, which gives me a lot of pain in my web server.
I hoped that signatures in BER format (default serialization format in the library) have fixed length, so all I need is to compare the length of signature with some constant. However, I found out larger contents enables larger signatures, so a deeper approach is needed.
bool ES256Verifier::Verify(const std::string& data,
                           const std::string& signature) {
    bool result = false;

              verifier_,

So, is there a way to look at the data and signature and decide if this particular combination is going to cause SegFault due to invalid signature length?
","Here's some sample code to determine the signature length using the Field Element, Signer and Verifier. The first output prints the element length and r||s length because r||s is the signature in P1363 format.
The second and third output just print the result of SignatureLength(). Your program should reject a signature shorter than SignatureLength(). There is no sense in even trying to verify a short signature since it is no good.
Note well: this only work for the DL_* signature schemes (based on discrete logs). It does not apply to TF_* signature schemes (based on trapdoor functions).
#include ""cryptlib.h""
#include ""eccrypto.h""
#include ""osrng.h""
#include ""oids.h""

#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    using namespace CryptoPP;
    AutoSeededRandomPool prng;

    ///// Element
    DL_GroupParameters_EC<ECP> params(ASN1::secp256r1());

    unsigned int elemLength = params.GetCurve().GetField().MaxElementByteLength();
    std::cout << ""Element length: "" << elemLength << std::endl;
    std::cout << ""r||s length: "" << 2*elemLength << std::endl;

    unsigned int verifierLength = verifier.SignatureLength();
    std::cout << ""Verifier signature length: "" << verifierLength << std::endl;

}

Running the program results in the following.
$ ./test.exe

r||s length: 64

And if you switch curves to ASN1::secp521r1(), then running the program results in the following.

openssl ec -in C:\OpenSSLx64\flir\newcerts\ecd.key.pem  -text -noout

All of my attempts yield a different length of bytes. Here they are:
X509Certificate2 certificate = new X509Certificate2(certificateBytes, password, X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable | X509KeyStorageFlags.EphemeralKeySet);

So I guess I have two problems:

I can't extract the private key properly.
I've read the private key is supposed defined as D. Apparently, it's not (the size doesn't fit). What is D in this context then?

","This was just a guess: 
math.pow returns a floating point number (which has finite precision).  I'd suggest using e.g. s.x * s.x instead of math.pow(s.x,2) in case the issue is hitting precision issues with bigger numbers.

"57421392","Using Google Cloud Key Management Service to sign an Ethereum transaction","I've been working on writing a signer service for an Ethereum transaction manager and I need to sign Ethereum transactions using Google KMS Golang APIs. I'll try and summarise the problems I'm facing below.
Ethereum requires compact RLP encoded 65-byte ECDSA signatures in R || S || V format. ECDSA signatures by Google KMS on the other hand have extra header components (R length, S length, etc) along with variable length R and S components. This makes these signatures incompatible for use with Ethereum transaction signing.
A way to get around this is parsing the R and S bytes from the ecdsa signature obtained from Google KMS, compute and add the V byte to the end and use this signature to get a signed Ethereum transaction. Something like this:
var parsedSig struct{ R, S *big.Int }
_, err = asn1.Unmarshal(body, &parsedSig)
if err != nil {
    logger.WithError(err).Error(""failed to parse signature bytes"")
    return err
}

However this would possibly fail due to one or more of the following reasons:

Creating compact ECDSA signatures of 65-byte length by parsing out the R and S components and adding the V component is possibly as distrustful as it sounds. R and S components as mentioned above are not always of 32 byte length for standard ECDSA signatures, which means that the ECDSA signature created by concatenating the components might not always result in 64 bytes.
Currently signed transactions in Ethereum are created from Keccak-256 digest hashes after RLP encoding transactions as shown below:

// from go-ethereum
func rlpHash(x interface{}) (h common.Hash) {
    hw := sha3.NewLegacyKeccak256()
    rlp.Encode(hw, x)
    hw.Sum(h[:0])
    return h
}

Asymmetric ECDSA key signing in Google KMS doesn’t have support for Keccak-256 SHA3 message digests. Would using a SHA-256 digest for ethereum transactions work? IMO this would fail since all transaction signature verification happens on RLP encoded Keccak hashes.
At this point I am not very sure how to compute the V component of the ECDSA signature after having checked the secp256k1 implementation of the secp256k1_ecdsa_sign_recoverable() function.

How do I go about solving these above issues to be able to create verifiable signed Ethereum transactions using asymmetric elliptic curve signing algorithm by Google KMS?

"58499196","ECDSA: Convert a binary public key of 60 bytes into PEM format for using it with PHP openssl_verify()","I want to proof a Wii signature in PHP. I have 60 bytes of the public key as binary data plus 4 additional bytes. And I know that it is ECDSA (most likely B-233). I already implement it in C, but the PHP interpreter is too slow for my implementation. So I call the external C tool to confirm the signature.
But I want to use openssl_verify($data,$sig,$pubkey). My problem is the third parameter (public key). So I have to convert ECDSA info plus the public key into an accepted format. 
Any ideas?
Progress
I tried more and created keys with different algorithms (e.g. sect233k1, sect233r1). My plan is to inject a so generated public key with my key. Now I get the error message:
error:0906D06C:PEM routines:PEM_read_bio:no start line

The public key looks like this:
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFIwEAYHKoZIzj0CAQYFK4EEABoDPgAEAS+URvH1x1GXfTw6VZh8tLVPq3bgYwl8

-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

","Yeah, you're on the right track. Assuming that the curve is known, you can derive the public key as follows (which is essentially based on an idea of this answer):

In the following, curve NIST B-233 (aka sect233r1) is assumed whose raw public key has a size of 60 bytes. If the curve is different, the curve ID must be exchanged accordingly and the size of the curves's public key must be used instead. 
Use any public key in DER-format that matches your curve.
If you don't have one, use OpenSSL to create a private key in PEM-format that matches your curve. The private key has the SEC1-format:
openssl ecparam -out <path to private key file> -genkey -name sect233r1 -noout

From this private key, derive the public key as DER. The public key has the X.509 format:
openssl ec -in <path to private key file> -pubout -outform der -out <path to public key file>

Determine the binary data of the public key with a hex-editor, e.g. online.  At this point it is made use of the fact that the raw public key is located directly at the end of the public key. In the case of B-233, the raw public key has a length of 60 bytes, i.e. the last 60 bytes of the generated public key must be exchanged with the 60 bytes of your current raw public key. This is the searched public key as DER, which contains your raw public key.
For the verification process with OpenSSL, the DER-format is sufficient if the -keyform DER option is used, e.g. 
openssl dgst -ecdsa-with-SHA1 -keyform DER -verify <path to public key file> -signature <path to signature file> <path to file for which signature is>

For the verification process in PHP with openssl_verify the PEM-format is required. A conversion to the PEM-format is easiest if the DER-data are Base64-encoded, e.g. online. Finally you have to add header (-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n) and footer (\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----). Please make sure that there is exactly one line break immediately after the header and immediately before the footer. In the last parameter, the hash algorithm used to create the signature must be specified, e.g.: 
$data = hex2bin(<binary data from file for which signature is>); 
$signature = hex2bin(<binary data from signature file>);
$pub_key_id = ""-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMFIwEAYHKoZIzj0CAQYFK4EEABsDPgAEAfERAiIKyPaby4+efUcRmv8ucekCFMnjc6fN1IeQAO6EMcKCcFLhKRJUHijUNp0Dv/CWYLUdeN0qNOI6\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"";

","Your problem has nothing to do with openssl, but your ""C"" code and your misuse of pointers.
Your problem line is:

Your code assumes it's changing the pointer in the calling function, it is not.  It's only changing the ""copy"" of the pointer.  You want to either return the pointer or pass in a pointer to a pointer and set it that way.

"58616145","How to encrypt and decrypt using ECDSA private key and public key generated in Hyperledger fabric","I am working on a basic-network project on Hyperledeger Fabric V-1.4.1. I have enrolled an admin and created a user using enrollAdmin.js and registerUser.js. A public Key and a private key is generated for user1. Now I want to use that private key to sign simple data and later verify using the public Key. I have tried using URSA node module which works fine with RSA keys generated through OpenSSL but isn't working with these two keys. Probably because these keys are not RSA, they are ECDSA keys. I have also read the documentation of the Crypto node module and it seems I need to have .pem files as keys to use in Crypto module. But In fabric, I have key files as -priv and -pub format.

Is there any node module that can encrypt decrypt using ECDSA keys?

Is there any specific way in hyperledger fabric to do this?

Or is there any other way I can do this thing? Please ask any questions if necessary.
Thank you.
","The two formats you see

priv 
pub 

Are wallet formate of filestorage
Try to register an identity and enroll with fabric-CA by importing identity service then you will receive certificate and private key just put it in a file and mark the extension as pem and it will work

"55042329","What cryptographic librairies will help calculate shared point and derive keys?","We need to perform some cryptographic operations and I want to know what cryptographic librairies can fit my need. 
The following is the context:
Given the fact that we have:

An EC Private Key stored in the HSM 
An EC Public Key (public point)
Encrypted AES key
MAC calculated with the EC public key ECDH

We need to perform the following:

Calculate a shared point (K~X~, K~Y~) using ECKA-DH algorithm from the EC Private and EC Public Keys. (See BSI TR 03111)
Derive K~ENC~ and K~MAC~ using KDF2(x, l) with SHA-256. K~ENC~ is first 8 bytes of output. K~MAC~ is last 8 bytes of output. (See ISO/IEC 18033-2)
Verify the MAC over the encrypted AES key against MAC ==> MAC = AES-CMAC(Encrypted AES key || ValueA || ValueB, K~MAC~).
Decrypt the encrypted AES key ==> AES key = AES-CBC(encrypted AES key, K~ENC~).


What cryptographic librairies will help calculate shared point baed on
  the fact that the Private key is stored in the HSM?
Can Bouncy Castle be used jointly with IAIK PKCS#11 wrapper?
Can IAIK-JCE a commercial product from IAIK help on that?

Thank you for your help.
Best regards.
","Since you are using HSM (your Elliptic Curve private is store on HSM) you can use API's from hsm vendors to perform your cryptographic operations. For eg: In case of Safenet HSM, Gemalto provides crystoki library like JSP and JCProv API's in java to perform all the operations you have stated.

"56308084","Which curve is SHA1withECDSA using?","I am using SHA1withECDSA to verify signed messages in my java application. Now I want to create a second application in another programming language (node/js) which creates those signed messages. 
However I could not find any api which has ""SHA1withECDSA"". All of them only support ECDSA with a selected curve. So my question: Which ec curve is java using?
Keyfactory:
final KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""EC"");
Signature:
final Signature dsa = Signature.getInstance(""SHA1withECDSA"");
","The {hash}withECDSA algorithms in Java support any curve that can be expressed in an ECPrivateKey object passed to Signature.initSign(key) or (your case) an ECPublicKey object passed to Signature.initVerify(key) which for the standard SunEC provider are any curve expressed in X9.62 (Weierstrass) form. This is basically everything used nowadays except Bernstein et al's {Curve,X,Ed}{25519,448} (EdDSA is an elliptic-curve signature algorithm but not the algorithm named ECDSA). 
The standard X9/NIST and TLS curves are predefined, although (edit) accessing them other than for key generation is a bit clumsy; see How does one convert a public EC code point and curve name into a PublicKey? .
Normally the keypair should be generated by the signer, and (only) the publickey distributed to the verifier(s) either in advance of or along with the signature(s) and signed data; often this is done in the form of a certificate, which avoids manual effort and manual mistakes that create vulnerabilities. Java directly supports X.509 certificates, and the publickey format used by them (SubjectPublicKeyInfo aka SPKI); see the javadoc for java.security.spec.X509EncodedKeySpec and java.security.Key. For EC, the SPKI includes the curve identification, but unfortunately the Java API provides no convenient way to get it back out. 
If you have an X.509 certificate or just the X.509 SPKI for the publickey in a file, in either DER or PEM format, and have OpenSSL, it can decode and display this info:
 openssl x509 -in certfile -inform {der|pem} -text 
 openssl pkey -in spkifile -inform {der|pem} -pubin -text # 1.0.0 up
 openssl ec -in spkifile -inform {der|pem} -pubin -text # 0.9.x

$sftp = new SFTP('server.ssh');

If I've done everything right (other than selecting good keys) so far, I would ordinarily have a 24-byte (i.e., 192-bit) digest, but if I digitally sign the digest prior to appending it, my experience is that the signature block isn't a predictable length.  I'm sure I could come up with any number of ways to identify the end of the message portion, but I don't want to make this a hack.  What is the accepted way of doing this?  (The signature will use ECDSA.)
I should also mention that this will be a multicast message using UDP inside ESP, since that puts constraints on message economy.  (That's also the main reason for the problem--keeping it binary.  The other is the practice of appending, rather than prefixing it with a byte count in front of it.)

This person signed a String with his private key. Given the signature that was made by this person, when he signed the above mentioned String object.
My task is to verify this signature, but have difficulties with it.
When I try to verify the signature with the below code:
    ...
    X509Certificate x509Certificate = getCertificate(certificate);

    Signature signature = Signature.getInstance(""SHA256withECDSA"");

I get java.security.SignatureException: Could not verify signature
Do you have an idea, how can I make it working?
Edited:
At the end, I managed to make it working, but do not understand the reason yet:
Before passing the signature to the verify method, i needed to do the following modification on it:
    byte[] rBytes = Arrays.copyOfRange(signatureHash, 0, 32);
    byte[] sBytes = Arrays.copyOfRange(signatureHash, 32, 64);

    BigInteger r = new BigInteger(1, rBytes);
    BigInteger s = new BigInteger(1, sBytes);

    ASN1Integer asn1R = new ASN1Integer(r);
    ASN1Integer asn1S = new ASN1Integer(s);

    DERSequence seq = new DERSequence(new ASN1Integer[]{asn1R, asn1S});
    byte[] signatureToVerify2 = seq.getEncoded();
    // verifying the signatureToVerify2 instead of the original brings success
    boolean bool = signature.verify(signatureToVerify2);

So the issue is obviously that Notepad encodes the text file in say ansi or utf-8, it doesn't matter but the line read from there must be looking different to python than when I enter the "" ...."" within python? So what coding to use or if it's impossible: what alternative to Notepad? This is for Python 2.7 in windows by the way.

... should I try catch the exception? What is the best way to handle this?

It depends on how you want to do it. I think there are three options.
The information below is from Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm and SignatureVerificationFilter on the Crypto++ wiki.
First, you can catch the SignatureVerificationFailed exception if you like:
try
{
    DSA::Verifier verifier(publicKey);
    StringSource ss2(message+signature, true,
        new SignatureVerificationFilter(
            verifier, NULL, THROW_EXCEPTION
            /* SIGNATURE_AT_END */
       )
    );

    std::cout << ""Verified signature on message"" << std::endl;
}
catch (SignatureVerificationFailed& ex)
{
    std::cerr << ""Failed to verify signature on message"" << std::endl;
}

Second, you can get the result as a boolean value. Notice lack of THROW_EXCEPTION:
bool result = false;
StringSource ss(message+signature, true,
    new SignatureVerificationFilter(
        verifier,
        new ArraySink(
            (byte*)&result, sizeof(result)),
        PUT_RESULT | SIGNATURE_AT_END
   )
);

if(result)
    std::cout << ""Verified signature on message"" << std::endl;
else
    std::cerr << ""Failed to verify signature on message"" << std::endl;

Third, you can forgo pipelines and just call VerifyMessage on the Verifier object:
bool result = verifier.VerifyMessage(ConstBytePtr(message), BytePtrSize(message), ConstBytePtr(signature), BytePtrSize(signature));
if(result)
    std::cout << ""Verified signature on message"" << std::endl;
else
    std::cerr << ""Failed to verify signature on message"" << std::endl;

I want to convert this file and sign in ecdsa to get the signature.
How can I achieve this in c language using openssl
","Read the key data from your PKCS#8 file using PEM_read_PrivateKey() (or PEM_read_bio_PrivateKey(). This will give you the key as an EVP_PKEY object. Documentation for those functions is here:
https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/PEM_read_PrivateKey.html
Typically when signing you normally want to digest the data to be signed first using some digest function (e.g. SHA256) followed by the signature operation (ECDSA in this case). Assuming that's what you want to do you should use the EVP_DigestSign* family of functions. Documentation for those functions is here:
https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/EVP_DigestSign.html
The code might look something like this (untested):
EVP_PKEY *pkey = PEM_read_PrivateKey(myfile, NULL, NULL, NULL);
EVP_MD_CTX *mdctx = EVP_MD_CTX_new();
size_t siglen = 0;
unsigned char *sig;

if (mdctx == NULL || pkey == NULL)

if (!EVP_DigestSignInit(mdctx, NULL, EVP_sha256(), NULL, pkey))
    goto err;

 if(!EVP_DigestSignUpdate(mdctx, tobesigned, tobesignedlen))
    goto err;

 /* Find out the signature length */
 if(!EVP_DigestSignFinal(mdctx, NULL, &siglen))
    goto err;

 /* Allocate memory for the signature length */
 sig = OPENSSL_malloc(siglen);
 if (sig == NULL)
     goto err;

 /* Now get the signature */
 if(!EVP_DigestSignFinal(mdctx, sig, &siglen))
     goto err;

I've already tried to concatenate the certificates, but it seems that it's just verified the first certificate of the concatenated exit.
","There are two possible scenarios we need to consider here.
1) The intermediate certificate is trusted by the verifier
2) The intermediate certificate is not trusted by the verifier
In the first case the intermediate certificate is in the trust store for the verifier. The simplest way to achieve that is to concatenate the root and sub files together:
$ cat testeroot.cer testesub.cer >testerootandsub.cer

Next we verify like this:
$ openssl verify -CAfile testerootandsub.cer testeapp.cer

Unfortunately when I try this I get some errors:
CN = ecc-crypto-services-encipherment_UC6-InMemory, OU = ApplePay, O = Apple Inc., C = US

CN = ecc-crypto-services-encipherment_UC6-InMemory, OU = ApplePay, O = Apple Inc., C = US
error 10 at 0 depth lookup: certificate has expired

So the first one is an ""unhandled critical extension"" and the second one is ""certificate has expired"". Lets look at the certificate:

First we can see that the certificate has indeed expired (""Not After"" is ""Jun 19 04:15:57 2019 GMT""). Secondly there is a critical extension that OpenSSL does not recognise:
            1.2.840.113635.100.6.39: critical
                ..

We can get OpenSSL to ignore these two errors like this:
$ openssl verify -ignore_critical -no_check_time -CAfile testerootandsub.cer testeapp.cer 
testeapp.cer: OK

The second scenario I talked about is where the intermediate certificate is not trusted by the verifier. In this case the verifier is assumed to have the root in their trust store, and the intermediate and end entity certificates will have been supplied to them. In that case the verification command looks like this:
$ openssl verify -ignore_critical -no_check_time -CAfile testeroot.cer -untrusted testesub.cer testeapp.cer 
testeapp.cer: OK

"58753715","Extract ECDSA parameters from Bitcoin Blockchain Block","I am trying to extract the parameters of ECDSA signature used in bitcoin to run some tests. For that i need to obtain :
  --- r and s ,  i.e., the ECDSA signature

  --- H(m) , the hash of the message used to generate the ECDSA signature

  --- the random integer k used in ECDSA signature generation, 
      this is, the k such that  s = k*(H(m) + x*r) mod q  where x is 
      the private key

I already was able to obtain the r and the s of a very specific type of block, the ones where len(inp.script_sig) == 214 ).
So i need to obtain these parameters for all blocks and also need to know how to do this for Ethereum and LiteCoin.

Presumably the request body attribute is a String, so it can be convenient for using through curl for instance
I guess for HMAC it would be Base64#encode(keyBytes).
For RSA/ECDSA I'm kinda confused.
https://www.cryptosys.net/pki/rsakeyformats.html
Specifies that RSA public key may be either X.509, XML or PKCS#1.
So, is base64 a good choice here as well ? or it should be some kind of US_ASCCI / iso-8859-1 string ?

The assumption is that the user may come later and GET the keys, so it would be nice if he see the same values he submitted earlier (avoiding any string alteration due different text encoding)
