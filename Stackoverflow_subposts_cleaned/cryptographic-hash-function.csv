","You can actually use a facility built in to the Java runtime to do this. The SunJCE in Java 6 supports PBKDF2, which is a good algorithm to use for password hashing.

SecretKeyFactory f = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1"");

Base64.Encoder enc = Base64.getEncoder();
System.out.printf(""salt: %s%n"", enc.encodeToString(salt));

We are storing 'salt$iterated_hash(password, salt)'. The salt are 32 random bytes and it's purpose is that if two different people choose the same password, the stored passwords will still look different.
The iterated_hash, which is basically hash(hash(hash(... hash(password, salt) ...))) makes it very expensive for a potential attacker who has access to your database to guess passwords, hash them, and look up hashes in the database. You have to compute this iterated_hash every time a user logs in, but it doesn't cost you that much compared to the attacker who spends nearly 100% of their time computing hashes.

If you must use them, then at least iterate the algorithm a predefined significant amount of times (1000+).

","While the NIST recommendation PBKDF2 has already been mentioned, I'd like to point out that there was a public password hashing competition that ran from 2013 to 2015. In the end, Argon2 was chosen as the recommended password hashing function.
There is a fairly well adopted Java binding for the original (native C) library that you can use.
In the average use-case, I don't think it does matter from a security perspective if you choose PBKDF2 over Argon2 or vice-versa. If you have strong security requirements, I recommend considering Argon2 in your evaluation.

This is a lower-level than anything I've ever programmed before, and I don't know much about hash functions except from Algorithms classes, so my question is: how do I generate these k pairwise independent hash functions?
Am I supposed to use a hash function like MD5 or MurmurHash? Do I just generate k hash functions of the form f(x) = ax + b (mod p), where p is a prime and a and b are random integers? (i.e., the universal hashing family everyone learns in algorithms 101)
I'm looking more for simplicity than raw speed (e.g., I'll take something 5x slower if it's simpler to implement).
","Probably the simplest approach is to take some cryptographic hash function and ""seed"" it with different sequences of bytes. For most practical purposes, the results should be independent, as this is one of the key properties a cryptographic hash function should have (if you replace any part of a message, the hash should be completely different).
I'd do something like:
// for each 0 <= i < k generate a sequence of random numbers
val randomSeeds: Array[Array[Byte]] = ... ; // initialize by random sequences

def hash(i: Int, value: Array[Byte]): Array[Byte] = {
    val dg = java.security.MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-1"");
    // ""seed"" the digest by a random value based on the index
    dg.update(randomSeeds(i));
    return dg.digest(value);
    // if you need integer hash values, just take 4 bytes
    // of the result and convert them to an int
}


Edit: 
I don't know the precise requirements of the Count-Min Sketch, maybe a simple has function would suffice, but it doesn't seem to be the simplest solution.
I suggested a cryptographic hash function, because there you have quite strong guarantees that the resulting hash functions will be very different, and it's easy to implement, just use the standard libraries.
On the other hand, if you have two hash functions of the form f1(x) = ax + b (mod p) and f2(x) = cx + d (mod p), then you can compute one using another (without knowing x) using a simple linear formula f2(x) = c / a * (f1(x) - b) + d (mod p), which suggests that they aren't very independent. So you could run into unexpected problems here.

","Scala already has MurmurHash implemented (it's scala.util.MurmurHash).  It's very fast and very good at distributing values.  A cryptographic hash is overkill--you'll just take tens or hundreds of times longer than you need to.  Just pick k different seeds to start with and, since it's nearly cryptographic in quality, you'll get k largely independent hash codes.  (In 2.10, you should probably switch to using scala.util.hashing.MurmurHash3; the usage is rather different but you can still do the same thing with mixing.)
If you only need near values to be mapped to randomly far values this will work; if you want to avoid collisions (i.e. if A and B collide using hash 1 they will probably not also collide using hash 2), then you'll need to go at least one more step and hash not the whole object but subcomponents of it so there's an opportunity for the hashes to start out different.

","You can't. SHA is an one-way encryption. Being able to decrypt it would break its sole purpose. Rather use a two-way encryption algorithm.

There are however so-called rainbow tables which enables you (and the hackers!) to reveal the original value based on a hash. For SHA the chance on a successful match is however much lower than MD5.

You need it to be unique, not just probably unique.  Therefore, you cannot use a hash.
You cannot have both worlds - you cannot have a 1:1 mapping that is not reversible.  Its an impossibility.
Encrypting - a bijective operation, so there'll be no collisions - IDs with a secret key will make reversing the ID to determine its original value very hard.

"16201292","Python Tornado: Is this secure?","I'm a bit of a noob here, so I'm trying to figure out some basics about web security. I have a very basic Tornado server running, and while it's only for use by me, I want to make sure I'm not making any obvious security mistakes.
1) Every handler except the login handler is decorated by @tornado.web.authenticated. Could non-authenticated users submit to, e.g., my AJAX handler, etc? (i.e. how much do I have to worry about them?)
2) Here's my login and authentication deal:
def do_auth(name, password):
  with open(auth_file) as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
  for l in lines:
    u,s,h = l.strip().split(':')
    if name == u:
      s5 = hashlib.sha512()
      s5.update(s.decode('hex'))
      s5.update(password)
      if h == s5.hexdigest():
        return True
  return False

class LoginHandler(BaseHandler):
  def get(self):
    self.write('<html><body><form action=""/login"" method=""post"">'
               'Name: <input type=""text"" name=""name""><br />'
               'Password: <input type=""password"" name=""password""><br />'
               '<input type=""submit"" value=""Sign in"">'
               '</form></body></html>')

  def post(self):
    if do_auth(self.get_argument(""name""), self.get_argument(""password"")):
      self.set_secure_cookie(""user"", self.get_argument(""name""))
      self.redirect(""/"")
    else:
      self.redirect(""/login"")

The point is that untrusted input is being used only in python's urllib.sha512.update() function and for a string comparison. Is this ""secure""? [Note: the auth file was made by hand, no functionality in the code to change it.]
3) Generally speaking, what other things should I be worried about?
","Let me try and answer some of this:
(1) 


Every handler except the login handler is decorated by @tornado.web.authenticated. Could non-authenticated users submit to, e.g.my AJAX handler


If your AJAX handler is decorated with @tornado.web.authenticated then the user will have to be logged in to call it. 
If it is not decorated it is accessible by anyone and you make the data publicly viewable and or writeable. Publicly viewable may be ok but publicly writable is probably bad. It depends what your data is.
(2) You dont need to write your own do_auth() function just a 
def get_login_url(self):
        return u""/login""

","I'll 100% disagree with the accepted answer and say that under no circumstances should an original password ever Ever EVER leave the client. It should always be salted and hashed. Always, without exception.
Two reasons...
. The client should not be relying that all the server components and internal networks are TSL. It is quite common for the TSL endpoint to be a load balancing reverse proxy, which communicates with app servers using plaintext because devops can't be bothered to generate server certs for all their internal servers.
. Many users are pathologically inclined to use a common password for all of their services. The fact that a server has plaintext passwords, even if only in memory, makes it an attractive target for external attack.

","There are two parts to this:

Why do we convert a String to a byte array before digesting?
Why do we convert the digest to hexadecimal?

The first answer is that digests only work on byte arrays. They have no knowledge of Strings, numbers or any other data type. Just bytes. So, we take a String object and convert it into a byte array using some form of text encoding such as UTF-8.
Note that the encoding is important: I can encode the string ""hello world"" in UTF-8, or UTF-16, or US-ASCII, or any number of other encodings. If I choose UTF-8 it will generate 11 bytes of output (since ""hello world"" is 11 characters long), but UTF-16 will generate 22 bytes of output. These two encodings will produce different digests, so knowing the encoding is vitally important.
The second answer is that digests are often used in string-based protocols such as HTTP cookies, for storing password hashes in text columns in databases, for adding PGP signatures to email messages and so on.
Since the digest produces a raw byte array it needs to be re-encoded into something text-friendly. This is why hexadecimal (or, more likely, base-64) is used.
For example, sticking with the ""hello world"" example, let's say the UTF-8-encoded digest turns into a byte array with the following values: 4 27 125 8 0 22 90 7 (for my mythical 8-byte digest function). If I tried to interpreted that as a UTF-8 string then I'd get a lot of garbage: 0 is not a printable character. Encoding it in hex means I can print it out in a meaningful way, or add it to my PGP email, or whatever.
Does that make sense?

I tried to find it on the internet but it is very limited and all I got is that both of them are O(n). Can anyone further enlighten me? Maybe give me a worst case and best case scenarios? 
","The MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms - both of which are not cryptographically secure and should never be used any more - are based on the Merkle-Damgard construction. This means that they're built by

starting with a block cipher that takes as input fixed-width block of bits and outputs a fixed-width block of bits of the same size,
padding the input up to some multiple of the block size using a cryptographically secure padding scheme, and then
iteratively applying the block cipher to a combination of some number of bits of the input, plus either an initialization value or the output of the previous block cipher.

Because the block cipher works on a fixed-size block of bits, the time complexity of running it is O(1). There are a total of Θ(n) applications of that block cipher (the input is split apart into fixed-sized blocks, so there are Θ(n) of those blocks), and the cost of computing the padding bit is probably O(1) but could potentially be O(n). Overall, this means that the runtime of computing these hash functions is Θ(n), which makes sense because each bit is visited at least once and the work done per bit is constant.
Block ciphers are typically implemented in a way that cause them to take the exact same amount of time to run on any input combination of bits - or at least, something very close to the same amount of time - to try to make them resistant to timing attacks where the amount of time required to compute the block cipher is used to steal some of the bits. As a result, it would be very unusual if these hash functions took different amounts of time to complete on different inputs of the same size. So independently of the fact that the runtime is Θ(n), you shouldn't expect to see much variation in the wall-clock runtime.

","crypt() is a function that creates password hashes from plaintext and a (randomly generated or provided) salt value. It can use several underlaying hash algorithms like DES, MD5, Blowfish or SHA.
Using a ""salted"" password means that the same plaintext input does not always produce the same hash. So you can't say ""I've seen this hash before it's the one for 'abc123'"".
As it's available in libc there are crypt() functions in almost all programming languages and database servers so its very interoperable.
How secure it is only depends on the hash algorithm you chose (specified in as part of the hash).

","No, nobody really knows -- it can vary from one implementation to another. The primary requirements are (N3092, §20.8.15):
For all object types Key for which there exists a specialization hash, the instantiation hash shall:

satisfy the Hash requirements (20.2.4), with Key as the function call argument type, the DefaultConstructible requirements (33), the CopyAssignable requirements (37),
be swappable (20.2.2) for lvalues,
provide two nested types result_type and argument_type which shall be synonyms for size_t and Key, respectively,
satisfy the requirement that if k1 == k2 is true, h(k1) == h(k2) is also true, where h is an object of type hash and k1 and k2 are objects of type Key.

and (N3092, §20.2.4):
A type H meets the Hash requirements if:

it is a function object type (20.8),
it satisifes the requirements of CopyConstructible and Destructible (20.2.1),
the expressions shown in the following table are valid and have the indicated semantics, and
it satisfies all other requirements in this subclause.

§20.8.15 covers the requirements on the result of hashing, §20.2.4 on the hash itself. As you can see, however, both are pretty general. The table that's mentioned basically covers three more requirements:

A hash function must be ""pure"" (i.e., the result depends only on the input, not any context, history, etc.)
The function must not modify the argument that's passed to it, and
It must not throw any exceptions.

Exact algorithms definitely are not specified though -- and despite the length, most of the requirements above are really just stating requirements that (at least to me) seem pretty obvious. In short, the implementation is free to implement hashing nearly any way it wants to.

","If the implementation uses a reasonable hash function, there should be no bits in the hash value that have any special correlation with the input. So if the hash function gives you 64 ""random"" bits, but you only want 32 of them, you can just take the first/last/... 32 bits of the value as you please. Which ones you take doesn't matter since every bit is as random as the next one (that's what makes a good hash function).
So the simplest and yet completely reasonable way to get a 32-bit hash value would be:

"36805327","MD5 acting different in SQL database and in PHP script","Recently I have created a script that handles login and register for my Game that uses http_get method to update stats. I have managed to create everything successfully, but there is a problem. When a user registers, it inserts different md5 string that PHP scripts generated and because of this, I cannot compare passwords.
This is the way I insert md5 string into a database:
$pw = md5($password);
    $insert = mysqli_query($connect, ""INSERT INTO Accounts (username, password, email,reg_ip, wins, looses, experience) VALUES ('$username', '$pw', '$email',  '$reg_ip', '0','0', '0')"");
    if($insert) {
            echo ""account successfully created""; 

        } 
        else {
            echo ""error"";
        }

And this is the way I check for passwords:
if($p['password'] == md5($password)) {
                echo ""login was successful!"";
            }
            else {
                echo ""incorrect password"";
            }

This is the md5 string that is in the database when user registers: (un-encrypted string is: pocakaj123)
54e8850ba5eca655854ddf1b503943

and this is the generated string when I echo md5($password).
54e8850ba5eca655854ddf1b50394348

","This is due to the length of your field in your database. You need to increase the length so that the whole string can fit.
Currently, it only accepts 30 characters so the remaining gets truncated:
54e8850ba5eca655854ddf1b503943

You need to increase the length to at least 32 to fit the whole string:
54e8850ba5eca655854ddf1b50394348


Note:
md5() is not a secure way to hash passwords, a better way is bcrypt() or instead use PHP's password hashing functions, password_hash().
Reason that md5() is not secure:

Hashing algorithms such as MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 are designed to be very fast and efficient. With modern techniques and computer equipment, it has become trivial to ""brute force"" the output of these algorithms, in order to determine the original input.

","MD5 is a hash function.
So it's only one way: there is no practical way to decrypt it.
Read the introduction of the wikipedia article about cryptographic hash functions to understand how those behave.
However, if you have passwords encrypted with this function, and you want to check that a user provided password matches, you can encrypt the user provided string, and compare the result with the encrypted blob that is in your database (which is the most common use for those function).

How can I get the same string as in the Python 2.7 result? .hexdigest is not the case for this also.
","You have the exact same result, a bytestring. The only difference is that in Python 3 printing a bytestring gives you a debugging-friendly representation, not the raw bytes. That's because the raw bytes are not necessarily printable and print() needs Unicode strings.
If you must have the same output, write the bytes directly to the stdout buffer, bypassing the Unicode TextIOWrapper() that takes care of encoding text to the underlying locale codec:
import sys

digest = md5(encryption_base.encode('ASCII')).digest()
sys.stdout.buffer.write(digest + b'\n')

Note that you must ensure that you define your encryption_base value as a bytes value too, or at least encode it to the same codec, ASCII, like I did above. 
Definining it as a bytestring gives you the same value as in Python 2 without encoding:
encryption_base  = b'cS35jJYp15kjQf01FVqA7ubRaNOXKPmYGRbLUiimX0g3frQhzOZBmTSni4IEjHLWYMMioGaliIz5z8u2:abcdefghkmnopqrstuvwxyz:4'

When you use str.encode() without explicitly setting an argument, you are encoding to UTF-8. IF your encryption_base string only consists of ASCII codepoints, the result would be the same, but not if you have any Latin-1 or higher codepoints in there too. Don't conflate bytes with Unicode codepoints! See https://nedbatchelder.com/text/unipain.html to fully understand the difference and how that difference applies to Python 2 and 3.

","Your 'for' loop is wrong for a couple of reasons:
1. the ending condition is incorrect - strSecret.Length has to be included if you start your indexing at 1.
2. when converting the legacy VB string functions, you have to be aware that they use 1-based indexing, while the .NET methods use 0-based indexing.
for (int intPos = 1; intPos <= strSecret.Length; intPos += 56)
{

    strEncode = strSecret.ToString().Substring(intPos - 1, 56); //get 56 character chunks
    strEncode = WordToBinary(strEncode); //convert to binary
    strEncode = PadBinary(strEncode); //make it 512 bites
    strEncode = BlockToHex(strEncode); //convert to hex value

    //Encode the hex value using the previous runs digest

If you have a limited amount of values, you could probably create a lookup-table (hash -> data that made it) but this is actually the exact opposite of how they are supposed to be used.

I have a fairly simple C++ program (measuring psi) that I'm transferring to an Arduino board. Would crc16 be OK or should I go with crc32 or would that be overkill?
","Checksums come up in the context of unreliable communication channels. A communication channel is an abstraction; bits go in one end and come out on the other end. An unreliable channel simply means that the bits which come out aren't the same as those which went in.
Now obviously the most extreme unreliable channel has random bits come out. That's unusable, so we focus on the channels where the input and output are correlated.
Still, we have many different corruption models. One common model is each bit is P% likely to fail. Another common model considers that bit errors typically come in bursts. Each bit then has a P% chance to start a bust of errors of length N, in which each bit is 50% likely to be wrong. Quite a few more models exist, depending on your problem - more advanced models also consider the chance of bits going completely missing.
The correct checksum has a very, very high likelihood of detecting the type of error predicted by the model, but might not work well for other types of errors.
For instance, I think with the Internet IP layer, the most common error is an entire IP packet going missing. That's why TCP uses sequence numbers to detect this particular error.

","SHA-256 is non-reversable so it can be shorter. But the real answer is google SHA-256 (or another cryptographic hash) and examine the code. Here is a real-world example of a hash. A bottle club has over 1000 members but has only 100 bins to store member's bottles. It just uses the last 2 digits of the membership ID number for the bin number, a simple hash. That reduces the 1000+ bottle to 100 pigeonholes.
