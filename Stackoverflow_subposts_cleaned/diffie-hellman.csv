","long/int to the byte array looks like exact purpose of struct.pack.  For long integers that exceed 4(8) bytes, you can come up with something like the next:
>>> limit = 256*256*256*256 - 1
>>> i = 1234567890987654321
>>> parts = []
>>> while i:
        parts.append(i & limit)

","Basically what you need to do is convert the int/long into its base 256 representation -- i.e. a number whose ""digits"" range from 0-255. Here's a fairly efficient way to do something like that:
def base256_encode(n, minwidth=0): # int/long to byte array
    if n > 0:
        arr = []
        while n:
            n, rem = divmod(n, 256)
            arr.append(rem)
        b = bytearray(reversed(arr))
    elif n == 0:
        b = bytearray(b'\x00')
    else:
        raise ValueError

    if minwidth > 0 and len(b) < minwidth: # zero padding needed?
        b = (minwidth-len(b)) * '\x00' + b
    return b

You many not need thereversed()call depending on the endian-ness desired (doing so would require the padding to be done differently as well). Also note that as written it doesn't handle negative numbers.
You might also want to take a look at the similar but highly optimized long_to_bytes() function in thenumber.pymodule which is part of the open source Python Cryptography Toolkit. It actually converts the number into a string, not a byte array, but that's a minor issue.

byte shifting 8 bits at a time: significantly faster.
using a ""C"" module and packing into the lower (7 ia64 or 3 i32) bytes.
This was about twice as fast as 2/ . It is the fastest option, but still too slow.

All these methods are very inefficient for two reasons:

"10471009","How does the man in the middle attack work in Diffie–Hellman?","I'm having doubts about the mechanics of a man in the middle attack during a Diffie–Hellman key exchange. I have heard that it can happen during the key agreement communication. But in the presence of CA (Certificate Authority) the receiver can authenticate the sender as he received the sender's public key. Therefore, how is a man in the middle attack possible?
","I think you're confusing the basic Diffe-Hellman, which is a key exchange protocol, with the 'authenticated version' which uses a certificate authority (CA).
Nice explanation of how the basic Diffe-Hellman is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle from RSA Labs.

""The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle
  attack. In this attack, an opponent Carol intercepts Alice's public
  value and sends her own public value to Bob. When Bob transmits his
  public value, Carol substitutes it with her own and sends it to Alice.
  Carol and Alice thus agree on one shared key and Carol and Bob agree
  on another shared key. After this exchange, Carol simply decrypts any
  messages sent out by Alice or Bob, and then reads and possibly
  modifies them before re-encrypting with the appropriate key and
  transmitting them to the other party. This vulnerability is present
  because Diffie-Hellman key exchange does not authenticate the
  participants. Possible solutions include the use of digital signatures
  and other protocol variants.""

and it follows with the authenticated version, also known as the Station-to-Station protocol:

""Roughly speaking, the basic idea is as follows. Prior to execution of
  the protocol, the two parties Alice and Bob each obtain a
  public/private key pair and a certificate for the public key. During
  the protocol, Alice computes a signature on certain messages, covering
  the public value ga mod p. Bob proceeds in a similar way. Even though
  Carol is still able to intercept messages between Alice and Bob, she
  cannot forge signatures without Alice's private key and Bob's private
  key. Hence, the enhanced protocol defeats the man-in-the-middle
  attack.""

So the basic version is susceptible to a man-in-the-middle attack, the authenticated version that uses public key certificates is not.

Is Elliptic Curve Ephemeral diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) is better than DHE ? 
","It's the ephemeral aspect of DHE and ECDHE that provides perfect forward secrecy.
The idea is that even if someone records traffic and compromises the server to get its private key, they won't be able to decipher that traffic, because they'll be missing the ephemeral DH parameters that won't have been saved. With fixed DH, the private DH parameters are effectively the private key: they would also be compromised in the same way and allow the attacker to decipher past traffic too.
(Note that support for fixed DH, non-anonymous cipher suites is quite rare in practice anyway.)
The perfect forward secrecy offered by DHE comes at a price: more computation. The ECDHE variants uses elliptic curve cryptography to reduce this computational cost. You may find further details and benchmarks in Vincent Bernat's SSL/TLS & Perfect Forward Secrecy article.

","This is due to the fact that new browser versions have started to either issue warning/errors when accessing web sites which are configured with weak DH ciphers for SSL. For more information about issue follow below links
https://weakdh.org
logjam issue 
To fix this either you can find a way around this at browser side or server side. Servers side is the best as it will fix the issue for all users , if they are accessing server from different browsers/locations. 
Fix the issue we have to make sure our server (in this case tomcat) use strong ciphers for SSL.
In tomcat, there are two different implementations of SSL. Defautl is JSSE implementation provided as part of the Java runtime. Other being APR implementation, which uses the OpenSSL engine by default. 
JSSE since it's dependent on the Java runtime, we have to first find out which Java version we are using with tomcat. Tomcat 7 supports java 1.6 upwards. Then we have to find the respective cipher suites supported by relevant java version of JSSE. Weak ones are which which has 'DHE', so pick ones which does not contain 'DHE'. Few of stronger suites for java 1.6 JSSE is listed below.

Restart the server and error/warning should go away. Remember if Java version is different copy/pasting above might not work. So refer to correct version and supported cipher suites.
Note: To be able to use the 256 bit AES Ciphers, it is necessary to install the JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files
If Tomcat is configured to use APR instead of JSSE, above configuration will not work. You can enable strong cipher suites by following tomcat ssl configuration guide for APR  and logjam admin guide .

All you are doing there is creating the number 0x1234567890 every time.  There is nothing random about it.
It looks like you copied from http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0490__Security/DiffieHellmanKeyAgreement.htm.  As this answer agrees, the code there does not make sense.

"22479508","Java Diffie-Hellman key exchange","I'm trying to execute code to perform the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. I sourced the code from an example online (forget where now).
I had to import the bouncycastle.jar, which I assumed worked up until execution.

my code:

  //generates a random, non-negative integer for Base

  private static BigInteger p512 = new BigInteger(""1234567890"", 16);
  //generates a random, non-negative integer for Prime

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Security.addProvider(new org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider());

    //Define specific algorithm to use ""diffie-hellman"", with provider ""bc""

    keyGen.initialize(dhParams, new SecureRandom());
    //initialize with parameters & secure random seed

    KeyAgreement aKeyAgree = KeyAgreement.getInstance(""DH"", ""BC"");
    //define algorithm for A's key agreement
    KeyPair aPair = keyGen.generateKeyPair();
    //generate keyPair for A

    KeyAgreement bKeyAgree = KeyAgreement.getInstance(""DH"", ""BC"");
    //define algorithm for B's key agreement
    KeyPair bPair = keyGen.generateKeyPair();
    //generate keyPair for B

    aKeyAgree.init(aPair.getPrivate());
    //initialize A's keyAgreement with A's private key
    bKeyAgree.init(bPair.getPrivate());
    //initialize B's keyAgreement with B's private key

    aKeyAgree.doPhase(bPair.getPublic(), true);
    //do last phase of A's keyAgreement with B's public key
    bKeyAgree.doPhase(aPair.getPublic(), true);
    //do last phase of B's keyAgreement with A's public key

    MessageDigest hash = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA1"", ""BC"");

    System.out.println(new String(hash.digest(aKeyAgree.generateSecret())));
    //generate secret key for A, hash it.
    System.out.println(new String(hash.digest(bKeyAgree.generateSecret())));
    //generate secret key for B, hash it.
  }
}

This is the line causing the problem:
KeyPair aPair = keyGen.generateKeyPair();

I'm confused as to what the error is, as I've found each of the methods it's returning 'unknown source' for.
Any light shed on this would be much appreciated.

","This is a system property, so you could set it via -Djdk.tls.ephemeralDHKeySize=2048 as a JVM argument or via System.setProperty within the code. (I haven't checked for this property, but some properties are read only once by the library that uses them, and then cached permanently during the execution time of the JVM, so you'd generally want to set that setting early enough if you set it within the code.)

"9833527","Client-side encryption over HTTP with Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange and AES","After watching a YouTube video on the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, I wanted to try an implementation in JavaScript (Atwood's law).
I sketched up an cipher on Node.js with the following rules:

Step 1: Client and server agree on a shared key:

Client & server start with a 512bit prime public key pK
Client generates a 512bit prime private key kC and sends powMod(3, kC, pK)
Server generates a 512bit prime private key kS and sends powMod(3, kS, pK)
Client & Server use powMod(response, privatekey, pK) as the shared key

Step 2: Communication

Before a client sends data it is encrypted with the shared key using the Stanford Javascript Crypto Library (256bit AES, HMAC authentication, PBKDF2 password strengthening, and CCM authenticated-encryption.)
Once the server decrypts the data with the shared key, it generates a new 512bit prime private key and sends it as a SJCL encrypted response.
The client and server switch to a new shared key using powMod(3, prevSharedKey, newPrivKey)


Now I have a few questions..
How secure would such a system be in comparison with HTTPS or other algorithms?  What are the weakest points of such a system?
In terms of security / practicality, would it be better to use 1024 bit keys for stronger security?  Are the HMAC/PBKDF2/CCM options overkill?  Is it worth modulating the shared key?  Thanks for reading!
","I've seen questions like this before – this is completely insecure for a number of reasons, foremost of which is the fact that it is impossible for a JavaScript client to verify that the server's key is authentic.
In a nutshell, without SSL, you are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.  No browser-based JavaScript crypto implementation can overcome this fact.

","Your system is massively insecure, but I'm not trying to dissuade you or anyone from playing around with stuff like this. You should continue to. But it is vital that you consider anything you create to be a ""toy"" system that should never be considered or advertised as ""secure"".
Let's break down the security question into two parts.

How secure is the key exchange?
How secure is the encryption you use once you've got a shared key?

Let me answer (2) first as that will be the simplest. It will be terribly insecure unless you are smarter than all of the people who've worked on and studied TLS over the years. TLS before version 1.2 (which few sites use) is vulnerable to Chosen Ciphertext Attacks (CCAs) in principle and to the BEAST attack in practice depending on cipher suit choice.  And SSL 2.0 is more badly broken.
The point is that very very smart people, working on these protocols over years, got some things wrong. There is every reason to believe that you are I working on these sorts of things on our own will make huge mistakes. The basic encryption algorithms are fine. They aren't broken. But the protocols are.
So if you haven't studied and fully understood all of the details of SSL, why they are there and how they have gone wrong in some cases, then it is almost certain that any protocol you devise will be terrible.
Now to question (2). There are two issues with this. (a) Diffie-Hellman is not designed to provide the sorts of security you probably need; and (b) I don't think that you've implemented DH correctly. 
2.a:
Diffie-Hellman Key exchange, when done right, is secure for key exchange, but it does nothing for authentication. This is why the question ""is it secure"" is often the wrong question. It is secure for some purposes, but massively insecure for others as it isn't designed for those other purposes.
As Josh3737 pointed out, there is no way for the client and the server to know that they are talking to the right party. If Sam is the server and Charlie is the Client, there is nothing that stops Mallory from setting up her own server that masquerades as Sam. So Cathy can go through the key exchange with Mallory, thinking that she is talking to Sam. Mallory can pretend to be Charlie when talking to Sam.
Once set up this way, Mallory can act as a Man In The Middle between Sam and Charlie. When Charlie sends data intended to Sam, Mallory will decrypt it using the shared key between C and M, read it (and possibly change it), and then re-encrypt it the the shared key between M and S and send that off to S.
To solve the authentication problem, you need some sort of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and these are really a pain. The system of Certificate Authorities and such that we have with SSL/TLS is fraught with problems, but it remains the best system out there.
2.b:
A 512 bit public modulus along with 512 bit private keys are not strong enough. DH keys need to be bigger. I wouldn't go with anything less than 2048 bits. You might get away with 1024 bits you aren't worried about someone being able to break today's secrets five years from now.
You didn't give enough information on how your primes were selected. Not every prime will work. You need to use a ""safe prime"" for your modulus, otherwise there are shortcuts available for an attacker to compute the discrete logarithm.

","If you want to get around the SSL cert and man in the middle problem, you can use the bitcoin blockchain. (Or an altcoin blockchain.)

But one part does not replace others.
From here SSL Diffie-Helman is used for:

This a Diffie-Hellman key exchange in

  keys.

","The two aren't really comparable. DH is a key-exchange algorithm, nothing more and nothing less. SSL attempts to establish that the server you're connecting to is really who it says it is. To do that, it uses a certificate that can be traced back to somebody you (are supposed to be able to) trust.
DH, by itself, only keeps others from reading the transmitted data. SSL is intended to establish considerably more than that (but can use DH to keep others from reading the stream).
Just for an obvious example, using DH (by itself) a Man in the middle attack is fairly simple. If I can get you to connect to my server instead of the one you intended to, I can use DH to establish a ""secure"" session with you. I then connect to the server you originally intended to. Every packet I get from you, I decrypt, re-encrypt with a key I used to connect to that server, and send on to that server. I do the same with all its response packets. To you, everything looks like it came directly from the original server, and the purchase you made (for example) works just like normal. The only thing that changes is that I also store your credit card number, and when you try to fill your car with fuel the next day, the charge is declined, because in the meantime I've spent all your credit.
The authentication in SSL is at least intended to prevent that from happening. If your browser tried to connect to (for example) www.amazon.com, it should give you a warning if my SSL certificate doesn't specify that it was issued to www.amazon.com -- and a CA shouldn't issue such a certificate to anybody but Amazon.
DH, by itself, doesn't really even guarantee most of what I've said above. By itself, DH is just a way to exchange a key (or, perhaps it could be phrased as ""exchange information necessary for both parties to create identical keys, without ever exchanging the key itself in the clear""). After both parties have the key, they can (and presumably will) use it to encrypt/decrypt data -- but that encryption is actually separate from DH itself.

","You can use anonymous Diffie-Hellman key agreement with SSL. This provides privacy on the channel, but no authentication.
Of course, without authentication, you really can't have privacy, because your private channel could be connected to a ""man-in-the-middle"". That's why the anonymous DH cipher suites are discouraged.

","The DH key exchange cannot, of itself, do encryption.  It is used to establish a session key, but not to do the encryption.   So, at this level, the question is mis-stated or reveals either lack of precision or lack of understanding (I suspect precision is the problem this time).
The question is:

Do you want to encrypt data with anybody at all?
Do you want to be sure who you are talking to?

As already pointed out, SSL uses a DH key exchange to establish a session key.  However, it also ensures that the program on the other end is someone you trust (directly or indirectly).  If you don't need to worry about whether the other person is trustworthy, you could just use a simple DH key exchange and then send encrypted data without needing certificates.  But you won't be sure who you are talking to unless you validate that - and the certificates used by SSL etc helps with that validation.

","The internet can help!

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle
  attack. In this attack, an opponent Carol intercepts Alice's public
  value and sends her own public value to Bob. When Bob transmits his
  public value, Carol substitutes it with her own and sends it to Alice.
  Carol and Alice thus agree on one shared key and Carol and Bob agree
  on another shared key. After this exchange, Carol simply decrypts any
  messages sent out by Alice or Bob, and then reads and possibly
  modifies them before re-encrypting with the appropriate key and
  transmitting them to the other party. This vulnerability is present
  because Diffie-Hellman key exchange does not authenticate the
  participants. Possible solutions include the use of digital signatures
  and other protocol variants.

So you have your own value for A, and you just swap the message contents and recompute signatures and forward along.

","Offering the Wikipedia answer:

In the original description, the Diffie–Hellman exchange by itself
  does not provide authentication of the communicating parties and is
  thus vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. A person in the middle
  may establish two distinct Diffie–Hellman key exchanges, one with
  Alice and the other with Bob, effectively masquerading as Alice to
  Bob, and vice versa, allowing the attacker to decrypt (and read or
  store) then re-encrypt the messages passed between them. 
A method to
  authenticate the communicating parties to each other is generally
  needed to prevent this type of attack. Variants of Diffie-Hellman,
  such as STS, may be used instead to avoid these types of attacks.

You may consider impressing your professor by discussing the variants of Diffie-Hellman that are more secure. For now, given you've noted the original implementation, this will do.
Best of luck!

Thanks in advance for any help
","Have a look at the answer from Maarten Bodewes in this question.
He gives Java source for encoding/decoding from the X9.62 uncompressed format into an ECPublicKey, which I think should be suitable for what you're trying to do.
== Update 1 ==
The spec says ""User Agents that enforce encryption MUST expose an elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman share on the P-256 curve"".
The P-256 curve is a standard curve approved by NIST for use in US government encryption applications. The definition, parameter values and rationale for choosing this particular curve (along with a few others) are given here.
There is support for this curve in the standard library using the name ""secp256r1"", but for reasons that I haven't been able to fully work out (I think it's to do with the separation of cryptography providers from the JDK itself), you seem to have to jump through some very inefficient hoops to get one of these ECParameterSpec values from this name:
KeyPairGenerator kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""EC"");
ECGenParameterSpec kpgparams = new ECGenParameterSpec(""secp256r1"");
kpg.initialize(kpgparams);
ECParameterSpec params = ((ECPublicKey) kpg.generateKeyPair().getPublic()).getParams();

This is pretty heavyweight because it actually generates a keypair using the named ECGenParameterSpec object, then extracts the ECParameterSpec from it. You should then be able to use this to decode (I'd recommend caching this value somewhere to avoid having to do this key-generation frequently).
Alternatively, you can just take the numbers from page 8 of the NIST document and plug them in directly to the ECParameterSpec constructor.
There is some code here which looks like it does exactly that (around line 124). That code is Apache licensed. I haven't used that code myself, but it looks like the constants match what's in the NIST document.
== Update 2 ==
The actual encryption key is derived from the salt (randomly generated) and the shared secret (agreed by the DH key exchange), using the HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF) described in section 3.2 of Encrypted Content-Encoding for HTTP.
That document references RFC 5869 and specifies the use of SHA-256 as the hash used in the HKDF.
This RFC describes a two stage process: Extract and Expand. The Extract phase is defined as:
PRK = HMAC-Hash(salt, IKM)

In the case of web-push, this should be an HMAC-SHA-256 operation, the salt value should be the ""saltBytes"" value that you already have, and as far as I can see the IKM value should be the shared secret (the webpush document just says ""These values are used to calculate the content encryption key"" without specifically stating that the shared secret is the IKM).
The Expand phase takes the value produced by the Extract phase plus an 'info' value, and repeatedly HMACs them until it has produced enough key data for the encryption algorithm that you're using (the output of each HMAC is fed into the next one - see the RFC for details).
In this case, the algorithm is AEAD_AES_128_GCM which requires a 128-bit key, which is smaller than the output of SHA-256, so you only need to do one hash in the Expand stage.
The 'info' value in this case has to be ""Content-Encoding: aesgcm128"" (specified in Encrypted Content-Encoding for HTTP), so the operation that you need is:
HMAC-SHA-256(PRK, ""Content-Encoding: aesgcm128"" | 0x01)

where the '|' is concatenation. You then take the first 16 bytes of the result, and that should be the encryption key.
In Java terms, that would look something like:
// Extract
Mac extract = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA256"");
extract.init(new SecretKeySpec(saltBytes, ""HmacSHA256""));
final byte[] prk = extract.doFinal(bobDesKey.getEncoded());

// Expand
Mac expand = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA256"");
expand.init(new SecretKeySpec(prk, ""HmacSHA256""));
String info = ""Content-Encoding: aesgcm128"";
expand.update(info.getBytes(StandardCharsets.US_ASCII));
expand.update((byte)1);
final byte[] key_bytes = expand.doFinal();

// Use the result
SecretKeySpec key = new SecretKeySpec(key_bytes, 0, 16, ""AES"");
bobCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);

For reference, here's a link to the part of the BouncyCastle library that does this stuff.
Finally, I just noticed this part in the webpush document: 

Public keys, such as are encoded into the ""dh"" parameter, MUST be in
  the form of an uncompressed point

so it looks like you will need to use something like this:
byte[] bobPubKeyEnc = toUncompressedPoint((ECPublicKey)bobKpair.getPublic());

instead of using the standard getEncoded() method.
== Update 3 ==
First, I should point out that there is a more recent draft of the spec for http content encryption than the one that I have previous linked to: draft-ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding-00. People who want to use this system should make sure that they are using the latest available draft of the spec - this is work in progress and seems to be changing slightly every few months.
Second, in section 2 of that document, it specifies that some padding must be added to the plaintext before encryption (and removed after decryption).
This would account for the one byte difference in length between what you mentioned that you're getting and what the Node.js example produces.
The document says:

Each record contains between 1 and 256 octets of padding, inserted
  into a record before the enciphered content.  Padding consists of a
  length byte, followed that number of zero-valued octets.  A receiver
  MUST fail to decrypt if any padding octet other than the first is
  non-zero, or a record has more padding than the record size can
  accommodate.

So I think what you need to do is to push a single '0' byte into the cipher before your plaintext. You could add more padding than that - I couldn't see anything that specified that the padding must be the minimum amount possible, but a single '0' byte is the simplest (anyone reading this who is trying to decode these messages from the other end should make sure that they support any legal amount of padding).
In general for http content encryption, the mechanism is a bit more complicated than that (since you have to split up the input into records and add padding to each one), but the webpush spec says that the encrypted message must fit into a single record, so you don't need to worry about that.
Note the following text in the webpush encryption spec:

Note that a push service is not required to support more than 4096
  octets of payload body, which equates to 4080 octets of cleartext

The 4080 octets of cleartext here includes the 1 byte of padding, so there effectively seems to be a limit of 4079 bytes. You can specify a larger record size using the ""rs"" parameter in the ""Encryption"" header, but according to the text quoted above, the recipient isn't required to support that.
One warning: some of the code that I've seen to do this seems to be changing to using 2 bytes of padding, presumably as a result of some proposed spec change, but I haven't been able to track down where this is coming from. At the moment 1 byte of padding should be ok, but if this stops working in the future, you may need to go to 2 bytes - as I mentioned above this spec is a work in progress and browser support is experimental right now.

I've got the client side working but now I want to be able to send messages with a payload from a Java server.
I saw the nodejs web-push example (https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-push) but I couldn't translate that correctly to Java.
I tried following the example to use the DH key exchange found here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html#DH2Ex
With the help of sheltond below I was able to figure out some code that should be working but isn't. 
When I post the encrypted message to the Push service, I get back the expected 201 status code but the push never reaches Firefox. If I remove the payload and headers and simply send a POST request to the same URL the message successfully arrives in Firefox with no data. I suspect it may have something to do with the way I'm encrypting the data with Cipher.getInstance(""AES/GCM/NoPadding"");

","The solution of santosh kumar works with one modification:
I added a 1-byte cipher padding right before defining the cleartext byte[].
Cipher bobCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/GCM/NoPadding"", ""BC"");
byte[] iv = generateNonce(nonce_bytes12, 0);
bobCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, new IvParameterSpec(iv));

// adding firefox padding:
bobCipher.update(new byte[1]);

byte[] cleartext = {...};

"6912219","Diffie Hellman and AES on Android","I am trying to use Diffie Hellman for key exchange and AES to encrypt data with keys. Can anyone provide me a suitable work sample for android ?
","I've actually been working on a similar problem lately myself. I don't have a working sample, but here are some points you should be aware of:

Android uses a partial Bouncy Castle package to handle most of its cryptography, but some people prefer to user their own cryptographic package (Spongy Castle is a commonly cited alternative) since Android's is incomplete. See the discussion in here.
If you choose to use Android's existing tools, you can access them through Cipher. Here is a useful list of algorithms Android supports.
Be aware that if you choose to use some non-Android Java crypto library, Android does not support all Java packages your library may need. See my (currently unanswered) question about how to deal with that in Spongy Castle.

Hope these help!

Hope you guys can help me with this. Thanks in advance! 
","You aim to go for 512 bit length:
kpg.initialize(512);
You can generate p and g of such length like this:
int bitLength = 1024;
SecureRandom rnd = new SecureRandom();
BigInteger p = BigInteger.probablePrime(bitLength, rnd);
BigInteger g = BigInteger.probablePrime(bitLength, rnd);

The probablePrime probably use Rabin-Miller or Solovay-Strassen test which gives only 2^-100 chance (virtually no chance) that the resulting integer is not prime. Since 2002 a there's a polinomial-time algorithm called AKS (Agrawal–Kayal–Saxena) to test primes for 100% certainty (but I haven't seen it used so far, probably 2^-100 is good for anyone).

Hope you guys can help me with this. Thanks in advance! 
","I assume your question is why you can only create primes from 512 to 1024 bits, while 2048 bits is recommended?! The answer is simple: the 2048 bits do not relate to the primes, but to the size of the modulus which is the product of the two primes. Two primes with 1024 bit each will give you a modulus of 2048 bit. That's why it's safe to use 1024 bit for the DH primes.
Regarding your exception: Csaba Toth is right: your primes are too small and the way to generate them is suboptimal. Just use your createKey() method and you are fine.

"18155559","How does one access the raw ECDH public key, private key and params inside OpenSSL's EVP_PKEY structure?","I'm using OpenSSL's c library to generate an elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key pair, following the first code sample here. It glosses over the actual exchange of public keys with this line:
peerkey = get_peerkey(pkey);

The pkey variable and the return value are both of type EVP *. pkey contains the public key, private key, and params generated earlier, and the return value only contains the peer's public key. So this raises three questions:

How would get_peerkey() actually extract just the public key from pkey for sending to the peer?
How would the code extract the private key and params from pKey to store them for later use after the key exchange?
How would get_peerkey() generate a new EVP_PKEY structure from the peer's raw public key?

I've seen the OpenSSL functions EVP_PKEY_print_public(), EVP_PKEY_print_private(), and EVP_PKEY_print_params() but these are for generating human-readable output. And I haven't found any equivalent for converting a human-readable public key back into an EVP_PKEY structure.
","To answer my own question, there's a different path for the private key and the public key.
To serialize the public key:

Pass the EVP_PKEY to EVP_PKEY_get1_EC_KEY() to get an EC_KEY.
Pass the EC_KEY to EC_KEY_get0_public_key() to get an EC_POINT.
Pass the EC_POINT to EC_POINT_point2oct() to get octets, which are just unsigned char *.

To deserialize the public key:

Pass the octets to EC_POINT_oct2point() to get an EC_POINT.
Pass the EC_POINT to EC_KEY_set_public_key() to get an EC_KEY.
Pass the EC_KEY to EVP_PKEY_set1_EC_KEY to get an EVP_KEY.

To serialize the private key:

Pass the EVP_PKEY to EVP_PKEY_get1_EC_KEY() to get an EC_KEY.
Pass the EC_KEY to EC_KEY_get0_private_key() to get a BIGNUM. 
Pass the BIGNUM to BN_bn2mpi() to get an mpi, which is a format written to
unsigned char *.

To deserialize the private key:

Pass the mpi to BN_mpi2bn() to get a BIGNUM.
Pass the BIGNUM to EC_KEY_set_private_key() to get an EC_KEY.
Pass the EC_KEY to EVP_PKEY_set1_EC_KEY to get an EVP_KEY.

It is also possible to convert the BIGNUM to hex, decimal, or ""bin"", although I think that mpi used the fewest bytes.

We're running Java 1.8, and the error message correctly specifies a max bit size of 2048, so the problem is not the JCE key limitation of 1024 bits in Java 1.6 and 1.7.  And we've confirmed that both our private and our public key are in fact 2048 bits, via openssl rsa -text -noout -in id_rsa and ssh-keygen -lf id_rsa.pub.
Since everything looked fine on our end, I started adding debugging lines to the JSCH code and recompiling the JAR, and I was eventually able to determine that the modulus being passed to us during the key exchange was in fact 2047 bits long.  Now, 2047 bits in length doesn't inherently mean that you didn't generate a 2048-bit key or that it's any less strong than a key that actually contains 2048 bits, it just means that you happened to get two primes that multiplied together to something whose first bit was a 0. So it's expected behavior (some of the time) and the JCE check should probably be (n % 64 == 0 || n % 64 == 63).  But JCE is a stickler on the point, so it rejects this key for not being of a length it considers valid.
Based on that, I thought I'd found the problem: the remote server had generated a 2048-bit key that only contained 2047 bits, so they just needed to generate a new one (and keep doing it till they got one that really was 2048 bits).  But when I asked their administrators about it, they were insistent that they were using a 1024-bit key, and indeed that's what you get in the known_hosts file when you SSH over.  So that doesn't appear to be the cause after all.
So I started logging the contents of the buffer that contained what they sent us and pulling out the p and g values (modulus and group), and I discovered that in just a few short periods of testing over a couple of days, there were 33 different modulus values, and all of them differed by only the last few characters when encoded in either base 64 or base 10.  Modulii values were reused, sometimes only once and sometimes a dozen times, but there were lots of distinct values, so the keys are neither generated for one-time use nor generated once and reused forever.
Is this (having the server send many different keys that are very close numerically, with some reuse but many unique values) expected behavior under any conditions, and especially is this expected behavior when the client uses a 2048-bit key but the server uses a 1024-bit key?  I know nothing about Diffie-Hellman group exchange besides what I've read since I started investigating last week, so maybe this is just how it works, but it seems strange to me.
Also, does the SSH standard specify anything about how keys should be generated in cases like these?  I haven't yet found out what SSH server the far side is using (I suspect OpenSSH, but don't know for sure and don't know what version), but I'm hopeful that there might be some standard that forces the use of keys that are of the same size as was requested (between 1^(n-1) and 1^n - 1), and that the remote server might have an option to force this or that I can submit a bug against them to get them to change the behavior.  I'll probably also submit a bug against the JDK to allow keys of n-1 bits, with 0-padding for the first bit.
Any guidance that anyone can give would be greatly appreciated.

","By default, keys aren't exportable - they are securely stored in the KSP. When creating the key, it needs to be marked allowed for export. Example:
var ecdh = new ECDiffieHellmanCng(CngKey.Create(CngAlgorithm.ECDiffieHellmanP256, null, new CngKeyCreationParameters {ExportPolicy = CngExportPolicies.AllowPlaintextExport}));
//Export the keys
var privateKey = ecdh.Key.Export(CngKeyBlobFormat.EccPrivateBlob);

To make this simpler, we can just export it from the CngKey directly and not use the algorithm if all you want to do is create a new key and export the private key.
var cngKey = CngKey.Create(CngAlgorithm.ECDiffieHellmanP256, null, new CngKeyCreationParameters {ExportPolicy = CngExportPolicies.AllowPlaintextExport});
var privateKey = cngKey.Export(CngKeyBlobFormat.EccPrivateBlob);

You can re-create the CngKey from the exported blob by using CngKey.Import(yourBlob, CngKeyBlobFormat.EccPrivateBlob) and passing that to the constructor of ECDiffieHellmanCng.

We have known public P and G and I need to generate a 1024-bit public key to send to the server.
The following is used on the server side in C++ with OpenSSL. Currently I am using the same code in a native DLL called via P/Invoke, and it works as well. I would prefer to eliminate the native DLL dependency if possible.
char publicKey[128];
char P[128]; //this is set to a static 128-byte value, omitting for brevity
unsigned long G = 2;

dh->p = BN_new();

I've tried using the DH classes in BouncyCastle, but for whatever reason I can't get it to give me a 1024-bit key, it wants to give me a 960 bit key instead. Possibly because I don't really know what I'm doing. I couldn't find much in the way of actual explanations of how the classes are supposed to be used.
Is it possible to use BouncyCastle DH classes to work the same as the OpenSSL DH code posted above? If not, is there another C# implementation that would work better?

","The basic principle is the same, but the selection of the private key and how the public key are computed are significantly different. In addition, everyone has to agree beforehand on the elliptic curve to use.
As noted, in the elliptic-curve version of Diffie-Hellman, you first decide which elliptic curve you're using. That determines a number of independent parameters called the domain parameters. Without getting too technical, it turns out that some curves are better than others for cryptographic purposes, so the parameters are actually chosen carefully rather than at random. This is somewhat analogous to picking good prime factors.
There are two sets of domain parameters:

E, the elliptic curve itself.
G, a point on E that is called the base point.

E and G are necessary and sufficient to describe all the information you need.
In ECC-DH, the private key d is computed by taking a randomly selected number on the interval [1, n-1], where n is the order of G. The public key Q is computed by taking Q = dG. After that the general idea is the same, except that instead of trying to solve a hard integer factorization problem, you're trying to solve a hard discrete logarithm problem.

is completely bogus.  p needs to be prime and gneeds to be a generator.  When I try running the example I get an exception.
This seems to be a more reasonable example (but I haven't tested it myself yet).
Basically the interesting input to the DH exchange is that (p,g) pair which needs to be generated and must have some unique properties.  Clearly, the example above shows just place holder values which will not produce a correctly functioning algorithm (p can not be equal to g and p should be prime, while in the example it is clearly divisible by 10).  The example I linked to shows how to use the libraries to generate a correct (p, g) pair. 
It is also worth noting that DH parameter generation is usually a separate step from generating the secret key.  While DH parameters are somewhat private, they are not as sensitive as your private key and can be generated once and then reused.
(Edit: Example)
AlgorithmParameterGenerator paramGen = AlgorithmParameterGenerator.getInstance(""DH"");
paramGen.init(512); // number of bits
AlgorithmParameters params = paramGen.generateParameters();
DHParameterSpec dhSpec = params.getParameterSpec(DHParameterSpec.class);

","From Cisco's docs:

Fixed Diffie-Hellman: 
  This a Diffie-Hellman key exchange in which
  the server's certificate contains the
  Diffie-Hellman public parameters
  signed by the certificate authority
  (CA). That is, the public-key
  certificate contains the
  Diffie-Hellman public-key parameters.
  The client provides its Diffie-Hellman
  public key parameters either in a
  certificate, if client authentication
  is required, or in a key exchange
  message. This method results in a
  fixed secret key between two peers,
  based on the Diffie-Hellman
  calculation using the fixed public
  keys.
Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman: 
  This technique is used to create ephemeral
  (temporary, one-time) secret keys. In
  this case, the Diffie-Hellman public
  keys are exchanged, and signed using
  the sender's private RSA or DSS key.
  The receiver can use the corresponding
  public key to verify the signature.
  Certificates are used to authenticate
  the public keys. This option appears
  to be the most secure of the three
  Diffie-Hellman options because it
  results in a temporary, authenticated
  key.
Anonymous Diffie-Hellman: 
  The base Diffie-Hellman algorithm is used, with
  no authentication. That is, each side
  sends its public Diffie-Hellman
  parameters to the other, with no
  authentication. This approach is
  vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
  attacks, in which the attacker
  conducts anonymous Diffie-Hellman
  exchanges with both parties.

","
client during the request creates a master key, which is then encrypted using server's public key and sent to server. This master key (as a plain text) is then used as a symmetric key for encrypting ongoing communication. Is this correct?

Well, all-in-all, No.
Because you are asking about DH and ECDH, which are Key Agreement protocols: the client does not generate a random key, encrypt it under the server's public key and then send it to the server. That's Key Transport (like RSA Key Transport), and not DH or ECDH. Key transport is going away in TLS 1.3.
There are two phases to TLS: key agreement and bulk transfer. The phases are not as well defined as in IPSec. When the client and server use DH or ECDH, they arrive at a premaster_secret. That's the shared secret drops out of Diffie-Hellman or Elliptic Curve  Diffie-Hellman.
They take the premaster_secret, they add a client random, a server random, and arrive at a master_secret. Then they take the master_secret and derive 6 symmetric keys from it:

Client initial IV
Client encryption key
Client mac key
Server initial IV
Server encryption key
Server mac key

Those keys are used to key a block or stream cipher.
If you notice, each side contributes to the premaster_secret - the client contributes g^a and the server contributes g^b. Then each side contributes to the master_secret through nonces - the client random and the server random.
The reason there's two contributions from both sides is transport schemes, like RSA Key Transport, don't allow the server to contribute to the premaster_secret. The server has to wait until the derivation of the master_secret to contribute to the key material via a nonce.
So the progression is premaster_secret to master_secret to 6 session keys. I'm not sure where the master key is...


If yes, how to decrypt the data, if I know the master key?

I think its usually easier to just plug it into Wireshark if you have the master key. The Wireshark wiki talks about a master key (though I don't know what it is - there's a premaster_secret and master_secret). See the Wireshark wiki for Secure Socket Layer (SSL).


It sounded pretty easy to me at first, so I just wrote this script

Yeah... :) Check out RFC 5246. That's Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2. Then let's talk about easy :)


Then I notice that master key is 96 byte long (48 as binary string)

96 bytes is the output of the PseudoRandom Function (PRF). Check out RFC 5246, page 13.

exception is thrown. It happens in the following line KeyAgreement.getInstance(""ECDHC"", ""BC"");
KeyAgreement aKeyAgree = null;
try {

  javax.crypto.KeyAgreement.getInstance(KeyAgreement.java:223)

I added the Bouncy castle provider to the java.security file in the JRE. But it did not help. I want to know the solution for this situation. 
Also this problem only occurs with servelets. I tested with a J2SE project and the code works fine. Exception is thrown only when I put this in a servelet.
","So, possible reasons: 

You repacked bcprovider.jar in some way, for example, with maven shade plugin. It made invalid BC signature.
You added/removed BC provider more then once. For example: How do I get javax.crypto classes such as javax.crypto.Cipher to work on a servlet with jboss?
Your jre installation or some jars US_export_policy.jar, local_policy.jar is corrupted or has invalid signature. Try to make some crypto operation with different provider to check this. For example, create 2K RSA key.

","My best guess would be that the key exchange are mutually exclusive, i.e. the openssh server does not have the algorithm that the client is looking for or the client does not have the algorithm to exchange with the openssh server. You could verify it by running wireshark on the putty to openssh server and monitor the exchanges and compare it with your own client. 
I would gauge a guess that is how putty works, if the exchange fails, fall back to another algorithm after 'querying the openssh server' for the algorithm it uses... since putty is open source, it might be worth your while to look at the code to see how putty accomplishes it.

","I think your problem is that you are using double instead of long (integer values), since doubles are stored only as approximations to the real number you might get rounding errors. See also this post Why is modulus operator not working for double in c#?

","As revealed by this question DH parameter generation is incredibly slow on Android.  (That asker thought the culprit was generating a new SecureRandom(), but I find the slowness in DHParametersGenerator.generateParameters(), specifically its call to java.math.BigInt.generatePrimeDefault().)  
Moreover, that asker shows how to use pre-generated parameters.  The parameters can be fixed, and the key pair generator will still generate a new keypair each time.

KeyPairGenerator keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""DH"");

I've done some tests running such code iteratively and varying the key size (in particular ramping up from 128 with a 128 step up to 1024. 1024 would be the desired size.
First of all, running each size generation 10 times to have some minimal std deviation on the results gives HIGH fluctuation of results, on average, anyway, the time needed for creating the keys (1024 bit) is: 683027ms, which rounds up to around 11 minutes for creating a key.
The questions are: 

Is anyone else getting the same results? 
Is there some optimization to be run in order to achieve lower times?
What is the high fluctuation dependent of? (i.e. for generating a 1024bit key it can take from 18 seconds to 30 minutes...)

","I did some further coding/research and apparently the call that's the most time (battery?) consuming is:
new SecureRandom()

In particular, though, since for DH the parameters (g, p, l) can be pre-computed and hard-coded it's a wise suggestion to do so beforehand and use the generated values to generate the key pair (which will be almost instantaneous).
Example code:
KeyPairGenerator keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""DH"");
keyGen.initialize(new DHParameterSpec(p, g, l));
KeyPair ackp = keyGen.generateKeyPair();

Where p, g, and l are:
final BigInteger p = new BigInteger(""X"");
final BigInteger g = new BigInteger(""Y"");
final int l = 1023;

And X and Y can be generated offline with:
AlgorithmParameterGenerator paramGen = AlgorithmParameterGenerator.getInstance(""DH"");
paramGen.init(1024, new SecureRandom());
AlgorithmParameters params = paramGen.generateParameters();
DHParameterSpec dhSpec = (DHParameterSpec)params.getParameterSpec(DHParameterSpec.class);

Since the ECPublicKeyParameters object only has one method getQ() I am assuming thats all that is required to reconstruct the key. The other parameters such as the curve used (P-521) are kept constant.
I am doing the following:
AsymmetricCipherKeyPair kp = kpgen.generateKeyPair(); //ECDHE Key Generator

ECPublicKeyParameters pubKey = (ECPublicKeyParameters)kp.getPublic();
byte[] aPubKeybytes = pubKey.getQ().getEncoded(false); //Should I set to true or false?

Unless there is another way to get the raw bytes of the public key pubKey, I don't see a way to get the bytes without invoking method getQ() which returns an ECPoint object.
My question is how to reconstruct the byte[] into a ECPoint object using bouncy castle's lightweight API. Or, better yet, how to reconstruct the whole ECPublicKeyParameter object using an byte array somehow derived from the original pubKey object.
","To whomever it may concern I resolved this issue by using the PublicKeyFactory and SubjectPublicKeyInfoFactory to encode and decode the key.
Using:
byte[] key = SubjectPublicKeyInfoFactory.createSubjectPublicKeyInfo(pubKey).getEncoded();

I was able to get the raw bytes of the key.
and using:
ECPublicKeyParameters bpubKey = (ECPublicKeyParameters)PublicKeyFactory.createKey(key);

I was able to recreate the public key.

","You're probably in the wrong area of the BouncyCastle class hierarchy for what you want to do.  (I stumbled around in the same place, for probably the same reasons.)  If you're looking to implement ECDH that must be interoperable, you're definitely in the wrong place.
Why is it structured so unintuitively?  Well, the reason is that the abstractions in BouncyCastle are where they focus their attention and provide their value.  Instead of gearing for people saying ""I'm going to use ECDH key-encrypting keys"" and wanting to deal with low-level crypto details, BC expects you to use manager-level abstractions like ""public key"", ""private key"", and ""certificate"", and fill in the security parameters like ""kind"" and ""bitstrength"" in the middle of it.

BouncyCastle will quite happily waste time and electricity recalculating the public key every time you load this, unless you take care to save _keypair.Public in something like a self-signed X509Certificate.
var _cgen = new X509V3CertificateGenerator();
_cgen.Reset();
_cgen.SetNotBefore(DateTime.Now);
_cgen.SetNotAfter(new DateTime(2999, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59, DateTimeKind.Utc));

_cgen.SetSignatureAlgorithm(             // Can be anything ECDsaWith*
    Org.BouncyCastle.Asn1.X9.X9ObjectIdentifiers.ECDsaWithSha256.ToString());

         8 * 8 - 1,                      // number of bits to generate
         _SecureRandomSingleton));       // source to generate from
var _cert = _cgen.Generate(_keypair.Private);
try
{
    _cert.Verify(_keypair.Public);
} catch (Org.BouncyCastle.Security.Certificates.CertificateException E)
{
    // error-handling code for Verify failure

TextWriter certWriter = new StreamWriter(certStream);
var pemWriter = new Org.BouncyCastle.OpenSsl.PemWriter(certWriter);

    var privateKey = pemreader.ReadObject() as ECPrivateKeyParameters;
    if (thisprivate == null)

    }
}
var certificate = new Org.BouncyCastle.X509.X509CertificateParser()
    .ReadCertificate(certStream);
var publicKey = certificate.GetPublicKey();

Now, that all said, here's the answer your actual question.
.NET 4 provides a byte[] because it's calling OLE platform-native code which does all of the abstraction for you.  It's the most efficient representation for this purpose, because it doesn't parse what it gets back from CNG, performing the least amount of object boxing back into the CLR object space and relying on the programmer to deal with what's essentially an opaque blob.  
BouncyCastle uses its BigInteger class because it's how it implements bignum calculations with 64-bit longs.  It is the most efficient representation for this purpose, because the overhead of processing 8-bit byte by 8-bit byte is far more than 8 times the cost of processing 64-bit long by 64-bit long.  Either way, it requires iteratively calling BitConverter on a different section of the input byte[].  Those iterations and method calls add up, so BigInteger is the ""internal representation of a number"".
These are not even remotely comparable uses, so this is probably not what you want to do.
If you want to get a byte[] from BigInteger, use its ToByteArray() method.  If you want to transform a byte[] to a BigInteger, construct a new BigInteger object with the byte[] containing the bit string you want to calculate with.  new BigInteger(oldBigInteger.ToByteArray()) works as you'd expect (a new BigInteger object which has the same value as the old one).  Directly working with them is usually inappropriate, because EC public keys are made up of two numbers.  Also, ToByteArray() only dumps the value of the integer, it doesn't include any DER encoding information to identify it as an integer of whatever length.
(Also, in C#, 'byte' and 'char' are different things with different sizes.  'byte' is 8 bits long.  'char' is a Unicode code point, and those are potentially larger than 8 bits.  'char' (along with 'string', which is conceptually a sequence of chars) requires encoding/decoding before it'll fit into byte-sized pieces.)

Treat the vector as a list of booleans, with one boolean for each number 0 to m.  When you view it that way, it becomes obvious that each value is set to 0 to initialize it to false, and then set to 1 later to set it to true.
The last for loop is testing all the booleans.  If any of them are 0 (indicating false), then the function returns false.  If all are true, then the function returns true.
Explaining the if statement you asked about would require explaining what a primitive root mod n is, which is the whole point of the function.  I think if your goal is to understand this program, you should first understand what it implements.  If you read Wikipedia's article on it, you'll see this in the first paragraph:


In modular arithmetic, a branch of
  number theory, a primitive root modulo
  n is any number g with the property
  that any number coprime to n is
  congruent to a power of g (mod n).
  That is, if g is a primitive root (mod
  n), then for every integer a that has
  gcd(a, n) = 1, there is an integer k
  such that gk ≡ a (mod n). k is called
  the index of a. That is, g is a
  generator of the multiplicative group
  of integers modulo n.


The function modPow implements modular exponentiation.  Once you understand how to find a primitive root mod n, you'll understand it.

Perhaps the final piece of the puzzle for you is to know that two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor is 1.  And so you see these checks in the algorithm you pasted.
Bonus link:  This paper has some nice background, including how to test for primitive roots near the end.

"3868881","Choosing a encryption key from Diffie-Hellman output","I implemented Diffie–Hellman key exchange in Java with some large groups from RFC 3526. My output is a fairly large array of bytes. Is it safe to use the first 448 bits (56 bytes) of the output for a blowfish key? Should I transform the bytes in any way, or pick any specific bytes for the key?
","From a theoretical point of view, no, it is not safe. Not that I could pinpoint an actual attack; but the output of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange is an element of a group consisting in q elements and offering sqrt(q) security at most. Truncating parts of the encoding of that element does not look like a good idea...
The ""proper"" way is to use a one-way key derivation function. In simple words, process the Diffie-Hellman output with a good hash function such as SHA-256 and use the hash result as key. Hashing time will be negligible with regards to the Diffie-Hellman step. Java already includes fine implementations of SHA-256 and SHA-512, and if you are after compatibility with very old Java implementations (e.g. the Microsoft JVM which was coming with Internet Explorer 5.5) then you can use an independent Java implementation of SHA-2 such as the one in sphlib. Or possibly reimplement it from the spec (that's not hard): FIPS 180-3 (a PDF file).
If you need more than 128 bits for your key then this means that you are a time-traveler from year 2050 or so; 128 bits are (much) more than enough to protect you for the time being, assuming that you use a proper symmetric encryption scheme.
Speaking of which: Blowfish is not really recommended anymore. It has 64-bit blocks, which implies trouble when the encrypted data length reaches a few gigabytes, a size which is not that big nowadays. You would be better off using a 128-bit block cipher such as the AES. Also, in any serious symmetric encryption system you will need a keyed integrity check. This can be done with a MAC (Message Authentication Code) such as HMAC, itself built over a hash function (then again, easy to implement, and there is a Java implementation in sphlib). Or, even better, use the AES in a combined encryption/MAC mode which will handle the tricky details for you (because using a block cipher properly is not easy); lookup CWC and GCM (both are patent-free; the latter has been approved by NIST).

","The solution that you propose depends on whether the most significant bits of a Diffie-Hellman exchange are hard core. There are some small results known that show that the most significant bits are unpredictable, but I'm not aware of a paper that is strong enough to show that your approach is correct.
However, there are several proposals for a key derivation from Diffie-Hellman keys.
E.g. a nice paper is NIST SP 800-135. So far this is only a draft and can be found here. However, it reviews some existing standards. Of course, using a standard is always preferable to develop it yourself.
While Thomas Pornin's proposal looks reasonable it is nonetheless an ad hoc solution. And to be on the safe side you should probably not use it. Rather I'd use something that has been analyzed (e.g. the key derivation scheme use in TLS version 1.2).

How do I convert it to the required type? And also I could not find the secp256r1 curve in OpenSSL, but I used the one in the code after doing some research. Is it correct?
Thanks !
","The peer's public key is a point on the curve. From crypto\ec\ec_lcl.h:
struct ec_key_st {
    int version;

    EC_GROUP *group;

    EC_POINT *pub_key;
    BIGNUM   *priv_key;

    unsigned int enc_flag;
    point_conversion_form_t conv_form;

    int     references;
    int flags;

    EC_EXTRA_DATA *method_data;
} /* EC_KEY */;

I believe you need to call EC_POINT_new (c_lcl.h is a private header, so you won't have access to the structure).
Luckily, there's a lot of functions to manipulate them. From the EC_POINT_new(3) docs:

EC_POINTs can be converted to and from various external
  representations. Supported representations are octet strings, BIGNUMs
  and hexadecimal. The format of the external representation is
  described by the point_conversion_form. See EC_GROUP_copy(3) for a
  description of point_conversion_form. Octet strings are stored in a
  buffer along with an associated buffer length. A point held in a
  BIGNUM is calculated by converting the point to an octet string and
  then converting that octet string into a BIGNUM integer. Points in
  hexadecimal format are stored in a NULL terminated character string
  where each character is one of the printable values 0-9 or A-F (or
  a-f).

Also see EC_POINT_set_affine_coordinates_GFp, EC_POINT_set_affine_coordinates_GF2m and EC_KEY_set_public_key:
$ grep -R EC_KEY_set_public_key *
crypto/ec/ec.h:int EC_KEY_set_public_key(EC_KEY *key, const EC_POINT *pub);
...

You can see an example of how to set the point on the OpenSSL wiki at Elliptic Curve Cryptography.

I'm trying to use BouncyCastle for that, but the almost non-existant documentation for the C# implementation has me stumped.
What I want to know is: what's the workflow for generating a DH key and computing a shared key when the other side's key is received? (I'm assuming I can send my key as a string and I can work with the other side's key as a string.) What objects/methods do I use in C# for that?
","Alright, after a lot of trial, I got it working. Posting answer in case someone else needs it.
I'll assume the reader (1) knows what Diffie-Hellman is and what it's useful for (read here for details) and (2) already imported Bouncycastle to a .NET project via NuGet.
Imports you'll need:
using Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto;
using Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Generators;
using Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Parameters;
using Org.BouncyCastle.Security;

How to generate g and p:
public DHParameters GenerateParameters()
{
    var generator = new DHParametersGenerator();
    generator.Init(BitSize, DefaultPrimeProbability, new SecureRandom());
    return generator.GenerateParameters();
}

Wanna get g and p as strings?
public string GetG(DHParameters parameters)
    {
        return parameters.G.ToString();
    }

public string GetP(DHParameters parameters)
    {
        return parameters.P.ToString();
    }

How to generate a and A:
public AsymmetricCipherKeyPair GenerateKeys(DHParameters parameters)
    {
    var keyGen = GeneratorUtilities.GetKeyPairGenerator(""DH"");
    var kgp = new DHKeyGenerationParameters(new SecureRandom(), parameters);
    keyGen.Init(kgp);
    return keyGen.GenerateKeyPair();
}

Wanna read a and A as a string?
// This returns A
public string GetPublicKey(AsymmetricCipherKeyPair keyPair)
{
    var dhPublicKeyParameters = _generatedKey.Public as DHPublicKeyParameters;
    if (dhPublicKeyParameters != null)
    {
        return dhPublicKeyParameters.Y.ToString();
    }
    throw new NullReferenceException(""The key pair provided is not a valid DH keypair."");
}

// This returns a
public string GetPrivateKey(AsymmetricCipherKeyPair keyPair)
{
    var dhPrivateKeyParameters = _generatedKey.Private as DHPrivateKeyParameters;
    if (dhPrivateKeyParameters != null)
    {
        return dhPrivateKeyParameters.X.ToString();
    }
    throw new NullReferenceException(""The key pair provided is not a valid DH keypair."");
}

To import the parameters from strings just do:
var importedParameters = new DHParameters(p, g);

To generate b and B just use GenerateKeys() with importedParameters instead of the generated parameters.
Let's say you generated b and B and already got p, g and A. To compute the shared secret:
public BigInteger ComputeSharedSecret(string A, AsymmetricKeyParameter bPrivateKey, DHParameters internalParameters)
{
    var importedKey = new DHPublicKeyParameters(new BigInteger(A), internalParameters);
    var internalKeyAgree = AgreementUtilities.GetBasicAgreement(""DH"");
    internalKeyAgree.Init(bPrivateKey);
    return internalKeyAgree.CalculateAgreement(importedKey);
}

Repeat for A and now you have a shared secret between 2 clients, ready to be used to encrypt communications.
Hope this is useful.

Is there a workaround or a solution to allow diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1 to be enabled?
","There is no ""workaround"" to the fact that DH key exchange requires moduli.  That's how the math works.  If you look in openssh_compat.py you will see that the getPrimes has a parser for openssh's primes format, and if you have moduli at /path/to/moduli then twistd -n conch --data=/path/to will parse them.  You can generate these with ssh-keygen -G.  You need to implement something similar on HoneyPotSSHFactory, implemented here: https://github.com/desaster/kippo/blob/master/kippo/core/ssh.py#L53
Remember that generating moduli takes a while so you will want to do it in advance.

"13319109","Performance of Bouncy Castle in Java","I'm having some problems with performance using the Bouncy Castle Provider when generating DH parameters. Anyone knows why the Bouncy Castle example below is about 50 times slower than using the standard provider?
Using Bouncy Castle provider:
Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());
AlgorithmParameterGenerator generator = AlgorithmParameterGenerator.getInstance(""DH"", ""BC"");
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    generator.init(1024, new SecureRandom());

Using standard provider:

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    generator.init(1024, new SecureRandom());
    AlgorithmParameters params = generator.generateParameters();
    DHParameterSpec dhSpec = (DHParameterSpec) params.getParameterSpec(DHParameterSpec.class);
    System.out.println(""P: "" + dhSpec.getP() + "", G:"" + dhSpec.getG());
}

","The reason for the speed difference is that the BC provider is searching for a ""Safe Prime"", i.e. a prime p: p = 2q + 1, where q is also prime.
As you noticed, this is a lot slower than just finding a prime. The standard provider is not doing that, as can easily be verified.
Looking for a safe prime might be overkill, as it may suffice to have p = 2Rq + 1 for some R, which admits of a considerably faster implementation, while still ensuring a large prime factor of (p - 1).
It shouldn't be necessary to generate these parameters yourself often (if at all). A single set can be used for many key pairs, and there are standardized sets of parameters around that you may be better off using.

What should I do?
","Specifying the key exchange method is done by choosing a cipher suite that supports that key exchange method.
You can the cipher suite on an SSLSocket (or SSLEngine) using setEnabledCipherSuites.
The tables of supported cipher suites and those enabled by default with the Oracle JRE are available in the SunJSSE provider documentation.
The anonymous cipher suites (_DH_anon_) are the ones that are vulnerable to MITM attacks. 
The _DH_RSA_ or _DH_DSA_ cipher suites also use RSA or DSA for the authentication of the DH key exchange (not for the key exchange itself), to prevent MITM attacks. In addition, the Ephemeral DH cipher suites (those that contain _DHE_, or _ECDHE_ for the elliptic curve variant) provide Perfect Forward Secrecy. (The non-ephemeral _DH_RSA_ or _DH_DSA_ cipher suites are not supported by the Sun JSSE provider anyway.)

When I generate the derived secret in Java I always get a different number from what I get from OpenSSL.

Each run of the protocol will produce different results. That's because each party picks a random value for each run of the protocol. That is, the a in g^a is random and different for each run, so the public key A = g^a is different for each run. 
If everything is working correctly, you'll never see the parties use the same values, or one party to reuse a past value. Independent executions will never produce the same result. It does not matter if its OpenSSL ↔ OpenSSL, OpenSSL ↔ Java, or Java ↔ Java. They will always produce different results.

var myDH = new ECDiffieHellmanCng(myCngKey);

","Well, .NET's doesn't have a good API into CNG. If you even scratch the surface of their API you immediately see it's kinda ridiculous, especially considering both are from Microsoft and CNG is the most serious of all Crypto APIs on the entire windows platform.
So you need to use CLRSecurity which provides C# interfaces (via P/Invoke) into the C++ CNG API. Even with that it's not the nicest of API designs; but it helps.
// Load the cert, many ways, one implementation
var store = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.LocalMachine);
store.Open(OpenFlags.OpenExistingOnly | OpenFlags.ReadOnly);
var certs = store.Certificates.Find(X509FindType.FindBySubjectName, ""My cert subject name"", true);
store.Close();

if (certs.Count > 0)
    cert = certs[0];
else
    return;

// Magic happens here! We load the private CngKey (if it exists)
// You need CLR Security for this, it manages the P/Invoke
// into the C++ api behind the scenes. 
var pvtCngKey = cert.GetCngPrivateKey(); 

// Create the DiffieHellman helper
var ecDh = new ECDiffieHellmanCng(ourPvtEcCngKey)
{
   KeyDerivationFunction = ECDiffieHellmanKeyDerivationFunction.Hash,
   HashAlgorithm = CngAlgorithm.Sha256
};

ECDiffieHellmanCngPublicKey theirPubCngKey = LoadOtherPartiesCngPublicKey(theirCert);
byte[] symKey = ecDh.DeriveKeyMaterial(theirPubCngKey);

System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException: The requested operation is not supported.

What do I not understand correctly (or on the more sad side, what is not implemented correctly (or at all) in windows/.NET)?
As an alternative, if somebody could explain how to port this Node JS library to .NET that'd work too (I think that's a bit of a reach) 
Update
I needed to keep working through the rest of the problem and not be held up by the encryption, so I used a Node.JS Wrapper to allow for further development on the .NET side. The node code simply generates the local public key and the Shared secret and returns those values to me. I still need to get this working without the Node wrapper.
Because of this test I can confirm that the rest of the code (not included here) works, so the issue definitely lies in the code above (and my inability to generate the derived key material if the HashAlgorithm is specified as CngAlgorithm.ECDiffieHellmanP256
","This solution is only confirmed working on Windows 10 64-bit. It is confirmed not working on Windows 8.1 64 bit, and is untested on other platforms.
The problem is that ECDiffieHellmanP256 is not a hash algorithm, but you are specifying to use a hash key derivation function. Your KeyDerivationFunction should be set to ECDiffieHellmanKeyDerivationFunction.Tls, and you need to specify the seed and label for the KDF.
Your fixed code looks like this:
var key1 = Convert.FromBase64String(""BOAiqZO6ucAzDlZKKhF1aLjNpU8+R2Pfsz4bQzNpV145D+agNxvLqyu5Q2tLalK2w31RpoDHE8Sipo0m2jiX4WA="").ToList();
var keyType = new byte[] { 0x45, 0x43, 0x4B, 0x31 };
var keyLength = new byte[] { 0x20, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 };
key1.RemoveAt(0);
key1 = keyType.Concat(keyLength).Concat(key1).ToList();

ECDiffieHellmanCng a = new ECDiffieHellmanCng();
a.KeyDerivationFunction = ECDiffieHellmanKeyDerivationFunction.Tls;

byte[] label = new byte[32];
string labelStr = ""The purpose"";
Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(labelStr, 0, labelStr.Length, label, 0);
a.Label = label;

byte[] seed = new byte[32];
RNGCryptoServiceProvider rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();
rng.GetBytes(seed);
a.Seed = seed;

a.HashAlgorithm = CngAlgorithm.ECDiffieHellmanP256;
a.KeySize = 256;

CngKey k = CngKey.Import(key1.ToArray(), CngKeyBlobFormat.EccPublicBlob);
byte[] derivedMaterial = a.DeriveKeyMaterial(k);

Note that I set a nonsense value to the a.Label property.
The NIST SP 800-108 publication defines the label as:

Label – A string that identifies the purpose for the derived keying material, which is encoded as a binary string.

I'm not sure what the purpose should be set to in your specific context. If anyone has a better understanding what this string should be, please leave a comment.
Also note that if you're going to call this function repeatedly, you should probably keep a persistent copy of the RNGCryptoServiceProvider and use that.

"6681549","Determining a Private Key (Diffie-Hellman)","I've been given a challenge and it has to do with testing a friend's encryption process.
It's a Diffie-Hellman exchange process, and here are the known variables / constants: 

P, G 
my generated private key (variable)
my generated public key(variable)
the recipients public key (constant). 

When looking at my private key - P and G are both within it. For example, the first 'x' bytes seem to have no relation to anything, then the next 'y' bytes are P, the next two bytes are static, and the next 'z' bytes are G, the remainder are variable.
The process is to encrypt a file, and send it to a device, which will in turn decrypt it - my ideas of attack are this:

try to duplicate the secret shared key. The problem here is that is fine as long as I know my generated private key, at which case - I don't for the files he's given me.
Try to find the recipients private key. Here, I could brute force my way in - but would take forever unless I had some sort of supercomputer.

Are there any other options to look at when trying to attack this?
","I probably should keep my mouth shut, but it is also an opportunity for those interested in Diffie-Hellman to learn something:

Simple implementation of Diffie-Hellman to generate the shared key is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. However, most implementation of DH tackle this issue properly by adding authentication between Alice and Bob.
If your implementation of DH allows declaring a new set of PQG, you could request the other peer to use a new weak set. If Bob does not verify the quality of this set, then it is vulnerable to attacks.
DH requires Alice to send X = g^x, if Bob does not check the quality of X, he is vulnerable, since the space of possible values of the secret key can significantly be reduced by Eve in the middle.
If your implementation does not remember compromised keys, they can be re-used by Eve.
If your implementation does not remember compromised certificates, they can be re-used by Eve.
If your implementation does not check certificates, Eve will have fun for sure.

I have a local area network, accessed by some users via cable some and via wifi others.
I have developed a local application in php which receives only some of the LAN clients as authentic users; they can be identified by the system with an algorithm of key exchange similar to Diffie–Hellman's, to estabilish a secret key. The client then asks to be identified throug such a channel.
The problem is, MITM attack is possible in this kind of situation. I read wikipedia about how such an attack is executed: somebody listens the messages of the two, and puts himself between them creating two different secret keys for the client and server.
This attack is reality, so it must be possible; but I do not understand how it happens in a LAN: 
the attacker can listen to the messages, and inject message of his own, impersoning the two subjects of the communications by forging https' IP fields if necessary... 
But he can't prevent the original unforged message to reach, concurrently (but also later, because of forging process taking the attacker computer some time) with his malevolent forged one, the recipient! Especially in a wifi connection, which cannot be cut off for a single user, for example cutting his cable.
So, client and server receive two different http requests from each other, a true and a forged one; isn't this a way for them to recognize that such an attack is in progress?
Maybe this question is newby-ous; as I said, I am pretty new at this.
","I think that is a scenario where you would use a digital signature (which also uses the idea that asymmetric encryption/Diffie-Hellman uses, that is ""public and private key"") to sign your messages. 
The MITM attacker can not forge a message with a bad ""from"" and then sign it with the private signature of the original sender. The recipient uses the public part of the signature/certificate to validate the message. So that way he will not only know he is being attacked but also which message is genuine.

"12993410","Why does iOS 5 fail to connect to a server running JDK 1.6, but not JDK 1.5","We have a Java Socket Server listening on an SSLSocket (port 443) and an iOS application that connects with it.  When running on iOS 5.1, the application stopped working when we upgraded the Java version of the server from JDK 1.5 to 1.6 (or 1.7). The app connects just fine to JDK 5 and 6 when running on iOS 6.
The iOS app is reporting an error:  -9809 = errSSLCrypto.  On the Java side, we get javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Received fatal alert: close_notify.  
On the Java server side, we have enabled all the available cipher suites.  On the client side we have tested enabling several different suites, although we have yet to complete a test involving each one individually enabled.  Right now, it is failing when we use TLS_DH_anon_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA although it has failed with others and we are starting to think it's not the suite. 
Here is the debug output.  It makes it all the way to ServerHelloDone and then fails shortly thereafter:

","May I suggest to use Apache or another HTTP(S) Server in front of your Java application Server? Just thinking into the future perhaps your application will not have Java serving directly all requests anyway (think about TLS security fixes, load balancing, failover etc). My two cents.

"12993410","Why does iOS 5 fail to connect to a server running JDK 1.6, but not JDK 1.5","We have a Java Socket Server listening on an SSLSocket (port 443) and an iOS application that connects with it.  When running on iOS 5.1, the application stopped working when we upgraded the Java version of the server from JDK 1.5 to 1.6 (or 1.7). The app connects just fine to JDK 5 and 6 when running on iOS 6.
The iOS app is reporting an error:  -9809 = errSSLCrypto.  On the Java side, we get javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Received fatal alert: close_notify.  
On the Java server side, we have enabled all the available cipher suites.  On the client side we have tested enabling several different suites, although we have yet to complete a test involving each one individually enabled.  Right now, it is failing when we use TLS_DH_anon_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA although it has failed with others and we are starting to think it's not the suite. 
Here is the debug output.  It makes it all the way to ServerHelloDone and then fails shortly thereafter:

FYI, this works in iOS 6.0
","If the app works with JDK5, I suggest to repeat the same test with JDK6 and compare the two log files: it should then be clear where the real differences are.
Inspecting your debug log, the server is saying that the client is sending a fatal close_notify message, and because of this the server closes the connection immediately, and that is the right server behavior.

7.2.1.  Closure Alerts
The client and the server must share knowledge that the connection is ending in order to avoid a truncation attack.  Either party may initiate the exchange of closing messages.
close_notify This message notifies the recipient that the sender will not send any more messages on this connection.  Note that as of TLS 1.1, failure to properly close a connection no longer requires that a session not be resumed.  This is a change from TLS 1.0 to conform with widespread implementation practice.
Either party may initiate a close by sending a close_notify alert. Any data received after a closure alert is ignored. Unless some other fatal alert has been transmitted, each party is required to send a close_notify alert before closing the write side of the connection.  The other party MUST respond with a close_notify alert of its own and close down the connection immediately, discarding any pending writes.  It is not required for the initiator of the close to wait for the responding close_notify alert before closing the read side of the connection.

Use JSSE and configure to use Diffie Hellman.
JSSE is Java's socket extension for SSL. Using the SecureSocket classes which provide the same interface as regular sockets (so your current code does not need to change) but operate over SSL you can achieve encryption in your network connectivity.
You should study the link provided to see how to configure to do what you need.

So I tried writing an HandshakeCompletedListener, and I do in fact get an SSLSession, but it appears to be the same one that I can get from the SSLSocket already, so the ""handshake"" session seems to be unhelpful.

","For most cipher algorithms, the length is determined by the name cypher name, as also mentioned here How to get the actual block cipher key size for Java SSL connection _in code_? .
Instead of trying to warn people when they are using unsecure cyphers, I'd recommend to disable those ciphers by selecting only the cyphers you want to support. You can do this on a jvm level or on the SSLSocket, e.g.
String pickedCipher[] ={""TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA""}; 
socket.setEnabledCipherSuites(pickedCipher);

Are those parameters' parameters baked-into the cipher suite (meaning they are always 1024-bit) or is this a configuration of the server that makes those cipher suites weak due to the specific DH parameter choice?

No, this is a configuration parameter for the protocol. There is a default of 1024 bits for Java but that may be changed globally for JSSE (the Java TLS implementation) using a system property: jdk.tls.ephemeralDHKeySize. Best set this during startup with a -D option for the Java VM.
For static DH key pairs (that are used for authentication) you would have to look into the DH certificate. But I don't think you'll find any, everybody uses RSA for authentication.

In either case, I'd like to be able to sniff that information from the connection if at all possible. Does anyone know if this can be done, and how?

Well, for sniffing tools such as WireShark would suffice. Undoubtedly you can parse things like DH parameters from a TLS connection (if they are used in the first place of course).
You can also debug connections using -Djavax.net.debug
For Java applications / libraries you could look up the cipher suite and then, if it contains DHE_ look up the aforementioned system property (keeping in mind its default values).

The Java JSSE API was not written with deep packet inspection in mind. It's (literally) a service oriented implementation for servers and client applications. Although you could of course use the OpenJDK code itself (it's GPL'ed, right?) you are better off using a separate implementation, possibly with an even more permissive license.
For a sniffer however I would rather use C/C++ (or at least a C/C++ frontend) than Java.

","Other people seem to have given good answers on the issue with your generation of random numbers, so I'll respond to your question ""Is this correct for Diffie-Hellman?""
Your understanding of Diffie-Helman is a bit off I think. For one thing, you keep using the term 'private key' as though there is also a 'public key'. Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a technique used for exchanging one symmetric key. There isn't a private key and a public key, there is just a key that both parties are going to use to encrypt their messages. Moreover, you said that this is code for 'generating' a key. With Diffie-Hellman, it takes two to tango. This code isn't enough to generate the final product of the key. You'll need to send Ya to a 2nd party and get something back from that second party to finish the process. See below for more info.
Your formula for generating Ya is correct, assuming that Xa is what it is supposed to be. I'm a little concerned about your understanding of what you're supposed to do with Xa because you're reassigning it to a random value after you've generated Ya. You will need to hang on to Xa in order to create the final version of the key. 
After you've generated Ya, you should be sending that to the other party. The other party will send you back some number in return (let's call that R). In order for you to create the final version of the symmetric key (let's call it SK), you will need to calculate it as 
SK = (int)Math.pow(R, Xa) % P;

So in a nutshell, don't recalculate Xa after you've calculated Ya, otherwise you won't be able to generate the key. The process goes:

Generate Ya (I'm just using this variable name because it's what you used).
Send Ya to some person.
Receive some number from the person you sent Ya to (called this number R in example above).
Calculate what the symmetric-key should be that you'll be using for encryption using R, Xa, and P. (See formula above for SK)

","The problem is the limited precision of Javascript numbers that causes rounding errors in your code where you first exponentiate and then calculate the modulus. For your example numbers, you could fix this by periodically calculating the modulus inside the exponentiation, e.g. by never calculating more than a square before taking the modulus. But for actual cryptography your calculations will involve numbers too big to be handled as Javascript numbers (and most programming languages pose the same problem). The usual approach is to use a large integer (or even arbitrary precision) library. If you do end up implementing your own cryptography, please watch out for side channels, e.g. by calling library functions that are not constant time or allow cache-based attacks by using data dependent array indices.

","3^54 is 58149737003040059690390169. It causes an overflow, therefore you should implement modular exponentation, since i don't know javascript too well i have written a c code which should be easy to implement in javascript :
int power(int a, int b, int prime){
      int result;
      if(b == 0){
           result = 1;
      }else if(b == 1){
           result = a % prime;
      }else if(b % 2 == 0){
           result = power((a*a) % prime, b/2, prime);
           result = result % prime;
      }else{
           result = power((a*a) % prime, b/2, prime);
           result = (result * a) % prime;
      }
  return result;
  }

Now you can call this function :
int value = power(3, 54, 17);

and it should work.
Edit: added javascript version
function power(a, b, prime) {
    if (b <= 0) {
        return 1;
    } else if (b === 1) {
        return a % prime;
    } else if (b % 2 === 0) {
        return power((a * a) % prime, b / 2 | 0, prime) % prime;
    } else {
        return (power((a * a) % prime, b / 2 | 0, prime) * a) % prime;
    }

When I test it using openssl s_client I get the following error after the ServerKeyExchange message : 

140735242416208:error:1414D172:SSL
  routines:tls12_check_peer_sigalg:wrong signature type:t1_lib.c:1130:

Here is the TLS message as seen in Wireshark

The Handshake fails on a decode_error fatal error.
So I guess the client doesn't like the signature algorithm chosen. 
But I am only using the default SignatureAndHashAlgorithm for now as per RFC 5246 Section-7.4.1.4.1

If the negotiated key exchange algorithm is one of (RSA, DHE_RSA,
  DH_RSA, RSA_PSK, ECDH_RSA, ECDHE_RSA), behave as if client had sent
  the value {sha1,rsa}.

(I'm still checking if the client do offer theses default values though)
Since I'm doing ECDHE_RSA I believe I should hash and sign the serverECDHparams as per RFC 4492 Section 5.4 (First post here so only 2 links sorry :) )
ServerKeyExchange.signed_params.sha_hash
        SHA(ClientHello.random + ServerHello.random +
                                          ServerKeyExchange.params);
struct {
    select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {
        case ec_diffie_hellman:
            ServerECDHParams params;
            Signature signed_params;
    };
} ServerKeyExchange;

And I should do this as per RFC 2246 Section 7.4.3 
select (SignatureAlgorithm) {   
    case rsa:
        digitally-signed struct {
            opaque md5_hash[16];
            opaque sha_hash[20];
        };
} Signature;


md5_hash
MD5(ClientHello.random + ServerHello.random + ServerParams);

sha_hash
SHA(ClientHello.random + ServerHello.random + ServerParams);

My Java code regarding signing the serverParams : 
private byte[] getSignedParams(ChannelBuffer params)
        throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, DigestException, 
        SignatureException, InvalidKeyException {
    byte[] signedParams = null;
    ChannelBuffer signAlg = ChannelBuffers.buffer(2);
    MessageDigest md5 = MessageDigest.getInstance(""MD5"");
    MessageDigest sha = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-1"");
    switch (session.cipherSuite.sign) {
        case rsa:
            signAlg.writeByte(2); // 2 for SHA1
            sha.update(clientRandom);
            sha.update(serverRandom);
            sha.update(params.toByteBuffer());
            md5.update(clientRandom);
            md5.update(serverRandom);
            md5.update(params.toByteBuffer());
            signedParams = concat(md5.digest(), sha.digest());
        break;
    }
    signAlg.writeByte(session.cipherSuite.sign.value); // for RSA he byte is one
    ChannelBuffer signLength = ChannelBuffers.buffer(2);
    signLength.writeShort(signedParams.length);
    return concat(signAlg.array(),concat(signLength.array(),signedParams));
}

So my question is basically : Am I wrong about all this ? and if so, what am I doing wrong ?
Thank you for your time ! :)
","It's me again, I seem to have fixed my particular problem 2 things I noted  : 

Regarding my Java code, the MessageDigest class only does hashing no signing so I now use the Signature class instead.
It seems I only need to sign using SHA1 in TLS1.2 I don't need to do MD5 at all.

The second item is what I should have found in the RFC but didn't (maybe it is written somewhere, I don't know) I think this could be useful for people even if they're not doing Java ;)
How my code looks now : 
private byte[] getSignedParams(ChannelBuffer params)
        throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, DigestException, 
        SignatureException, InvalidKeyException {
    byte[] signedParams = null;
    Signature signature = Signature.getInstance(selectedSignAndHash.toString());
    ChannelBuffer signAlg = ChannelBuffers.buffer(2);
    signAlg.writeByte(selectedSignAndHash.hash.value);
    signature.initSign(privateKey);

    signature.update(clientRandom);
    signature.update(serverRandom);
    signature.update(params.toByteBuffer());

    signedParams = signature.sign();

    signAlg.writeByte(session.cipherSuite.sign.value);
    ChannelBuffer signLength = ChannelBuffers.buffer(2);
    signLength.writeShort(signedParams.length);
    return concat(signAlg.array(), concat(signLength.array(), signedParams));
}

The code is different because in between I added a function to choose the SignatureAndHashAlgorithm to use from the list the client provides. But you could modify this to only respond using SHA1withRSA as this seems to be the default HashAndSignatureAlgorithm.

","In a PKI system, ""certifying authorities"" are an important part of the infrastructure. Certifying authorities sign the public key and the identifying information, so that you know the corresponding private really belongs to the purported identity. This is true for EC keys just as it is for RSA.
By the way, I've looked for CAs that issue EC certificates, and apparently they aren't in practical use.
Most people obtain certificates for their certifying authorities as part of their operating system or security application. They trust these certificates implicitly. There are several dangers here, though.
First, most users don't have an effective way to verify the integrity of these certificates. This is a pretty hard problem, because, at the root of it, you have to have a 100% trustworthy channel for the verification—channel between the authority and the user with which an attacker cannot tamper. When a user downloads a new browser with an collection of root certificates, he can't know that the software wasn't tampered with in transit, or even built with a bogus CA certificate in the collection.
Even if the certificate collection is received intact as the provider intended, there have been questions raised about the integrity of many certifying authorities included by default in popular software. For example, some have pointed out that telecommunications companies in states that have been linked to terror sponsorship have their certificates included in popular browsers. Any trusted authority can issue a certificate for any domain name, and a browser will accept it without question.
In short, no, there is no way to establish a secure channel without first sharing some information on a secure channel. The benefit of PKI and asymmetric cryptography is that one exchange on a secure channel (the receipt of a trusted authority's certificate) permits the establishment of secure channels with many parties. But you have to bootstrap the system somehow.

","It sounds like you are heading down a path of rolling your own crypto protocol.  Don't do that.  It's a bad idea.  It leads to insecure systems.
Instead, use SSL or TLS.  That is designed to take care of the subtle issues in designing this kind of crypto protocol -- and it has been well-vetted.  You'll need a way to verify the other endpoint's certificate.  You could use a certification authority, or in some cases it might be feasible to hardcode the public key of the entity you expect to talk to.

I'm not familar with WinAPI at all so I simply can't do anything but reading docs.
I need to exchange keys between a Windows-based desktop app and a web app. What I need to know is how exactly CNG's KDF uses (hashes in my case) the secret agreement value. I'm using the SHA-256 algorithm as KDF and trying to hash X and Y of the secret agreement but result doesn't match to the one CNG computes. Any ideas?
Thank you.
","I cannot vouch for what Microsoft found fit to implement, but there is a standard on ECDH called X9.63. In that standard, ECDH works like this:

You run the DH thing, yielding the common curve point (X, Y) (that's the point you got from the peer, multiplied by your secret DH value).
You convert X (and only X; Y is discarded) into a sequence of bytes which we will call Z. Conversion is unsigned big-endian, and uses the field size: if X lives in field Fq, then the conversion yields exactly ceil(ceil(log q)/8). E.g. if you use the NIST P-521 curve, you work modulo a prime q which is such that 2520 < q < 2521, so ceil(log q) = 521 and the resulting byte sequence consists in exactly 66 bytes, whatever the value X. With the most commonly used elliptic curve (known as ""P-256""), that's 32 bytes.
To derive Z into a key, with a hash function H which has an output length of n bytes (e.g. n = 32 with SHA-256), you compute the potentially infinite string H1||H2||H3||... where ""||"" denotes concatenation, and Hi = H(Z||i) where ""i"" is represented as four bytes, using big-endian convention. In plain words, you hash Z along with a 32-bit counter, and do so again and again until you have enough bytes for your intended key length.

Is there any way to set the minimum key length using public APIs?

Yes (or maybe I should say, ""I believe so""). Use your Diffie-Hellman callback. The callback is set with SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh_callback and SSL_set_tmp_dh_callback.
Usually the Diffie-Hellman callback is used on the server to generate its keys. But according to OpenSSL's SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh_callback(3) man page, its ""... to be used when a DH parameters are required for tmp_dh_callback..."".
For an example of using the callback in the context of a server (which should be similar to using it in a client), see 'No Shared Cipher' Error with EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA. It performs key length checks.

But after Alice and Bob exchange keys, they calculate different shared secrets.
The keys are printed out on each side (PubA, PrivA, PubB, PrivB, DHPrime, DHGenerator) and I can see that they are the same.
I suspect there is an issue about little/big endianness, or maybe openssl doesn't care about negative numbers for the exponent, and I don't know how to debug those operations. I don't have the code with me right now, but all the operations are kept simple, like this. 
C# side
BigInteger bintA = new BigInteger(baByteArrayReceived);
BigInteger bintb = new BigInteger(baRandomBobSecret);
BigInteger bintDHPrime = new BigInteger(baDHPrime2048);

BigInteger bintSharedSecret = bintA.ModPow(bintb,bintDHPrime);

C side
BIGNUM *bnB = BN_new();
BIGNUM *bna = BN_new();
BIGNUM *bnDHPrime = BN_new();
BIGNUM *bnResult = BN_new();
BN_CTX *bnctx = BN_CTX_new();

Some additional info for C methods of OpenSSL:
>

BIGNUM *BN_bin2bn(const uint8_t *in, size_t len, BIGNUM *ret);

BN_bin2bn sets |*ret| to the value of |len| bytes from |in|, interpreted as a big-endian number, and returns |ret|. If |ret| is NULL then a fresh |BIGNUM| is allocated and returned. It returns NULL on allocation failure.
 int BN_mod_exp(BIGNUM *r, const BIGNUM *a, const BIGNUM *p, 
     const BIGNUM *m, BN_CTX *ctx);

BN_mod_exp sets |r| equal to |a|^{|p|} mod |m|. It does so with the best algorithm for the values provided and can run in constant time if |BN_FLG_CONSTTIME| is set for |p|. It returns one on success or zero otherwise.

And they produce different results.

","SSL/TLS suffers from the same problem that any Diffie-Hellman-based implementation you come up with would have, in that it can still be broken by a man-in-the-middle attack.
The reason TLS is secure and trusted is because the client, when receiving the server's certificate, authenticates it by checking that it is signed with another certificate from a known trusted identity - say, VeriSign. Thus far, this makes it impossible to enact a man-in-the-middle attack without having VeriSign's private key - when the interloper sends a fake certificate proclaiming to be the server, the client would easily detect that this certificate is not signed using the trusted identity's certificate, and bails out of the connection, displaying a warning to the user.
For your purposes, it's likely easiest to use TLS. To make it secure, you would generate a certificate for your server, and then embed in your client the public key for that certificate. The client can then verify that it is talking to your server, without having to expose the private key, which you don't have to distribute.
EDIT: In response to your comment on Jerry's answer, if your hosting provider doesn't allow SSL/TLS connections at all, preventing a man-in-the-middle attack will be tricky. If this is your only reason for avoiding TLS, I would suggest getting your provider to turn it on, or finding a provider that allows for it.
EDIT: In response to your edited question: even if you're now using RSA in your Silverlight client to send data to your web service, you cannot guarantee that the client itself has not been modified. It's quite possible for an attacker to dig into your client, determine the algorithm you're using to perform the encryption/handshake, and then write code to impersonate your client (or indeed, modify the client to include their code). Once they've done that, they can start analyzing your API and use it to make calls to your web service.
It's the same with SSL/TLS - the client can validate the identity of the host using the host's certificate, and as long as the host's server is secured, the client can trust the output from the host; however, there is no mechanism in which the host can 100% validate that the client is who they say they are, as the client will be run on a machine which does not have a controlled execution environment.
However - despite the above being true, and that it's possible that an attacker can compromise your system in this way, it's likely not probable -- unless you're working on a public-facing system that attracts a lot of attention/use, or a system that deals directly with money in some form, the attacker needs to make some effort before being able to send their own input to your web service.
Your best bet is to validate the input received by your web service thoroughly, and don't leave dangling APIs accessible that your regular client would never use.

http://enanocms.org/News:Article/2008/02/20/Diffie_Hellman_key_exchange_implemented
You can then re-write the javascript in silverlight.  I recommend using Wireshark to dump packets then you can use Meld or whatever to diff the packets to see where your implementation is differs from the original. 
Good Luck!
(Disclaimer:  I totally agree with the Enano dev team,  this is not a full replacement of SSL and SSL should be used whenever possible.)

After SSH_MSG_KEXINIT messages there is SSH_MSG_KEXDH_INIT (30) and SSH_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY (31).
my problem is the understanding of SSH_MSG_KEXDH_INIT and SSH_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY.
According to the rfc4253:
First, the client sends the following:

  byte      SSH_MSG_KEXDH_INIT
  mpint     e

The server then responds with the following:

  byte      SSH_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY
  string    server public host key and certificates (K_S)
  mpint     f
  string    signature of H

but with wireshark i see:

what are 'payload' fields? how base 'G' and modulus 'P' are negociated? an ecdsa public key is prime or composite number?
this is my analyze:
a)wireshark is wrong.
If rfc is right, payloads field are 'e' and 'f'!
But there is a problem : if rfc is right, modulus p and base g have to be known BEFORE SSH_MSG_KEXDH_INIT because we need them to compute 'e'; so the wireshark decoding is wrong because wireshark tell me that P and G are transmit AFTER SSH_MSG_KEXDH_INIT.
and there is something else telling me wireshark is wrong : if i decode the base64 that i can find in the /etc/....pub file, i can see the value of wireshark DH_modulus field.
So DH_modulus field is not really DH_modulus but server public host key : rfc is right, wireshark is wrong!
In this case base and modulus are not transmit by ""Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Reply"" so how 'g' and 'p' are transmitted??are they ""prefixed"" in all ssh client/server and never transmitted?
b)wireshark is right
if we suppose server public host key is a prime number it can be DH_modulus and rfc AND wireshark are right.
but in this, there is again a problem : payload from client can't be 'e' because payload is transmit before DH_modulus and DH_base...
so what are the payload field? 
when 'e' and 'f' are sent? because just after ""Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Reply"" i have ""Newkeys messages"" which indicate the end of key exchange
but on other hand i have 4 packets to/from port 22 which are not decoded as ssh but it is maybe ""e"" and ""f""??
first two packet are 48 bytes length and the 2 others are 64bytes length.
are 'e' and 'f' transmitted in these 4 tcp packets ? maybe e and f are 64+48=112 bytes length?
as you can see i'm in confusion. can you help me (maybe not for all question but some indications can help)
thank you.
","In this case it's Wireshark incorrectly interpreting the public key algorithm.  Packet number 13 which came from the server is properly formatted according to RFC5656 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656).  It's using the ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 algorithm which is an elliptic curve algorithm with 2 variables: q and r.
Wireshark is improperly parsing this packet using a different RFC (although not strictly 4253).  RFC5656 section 3.1 will give you the information you need to get on the right track.  For your information I'll post variables r and s in this response.
In reality, the information contained is:
Server's public host key (string K_S):
    string  ""ecdsa-sha2-nistp256"" (where ""nistp256"" is the [identifier])
    byte[n]  ecc_key_blob
               string  ""nistp256"" (repeated again as [identifier] portion of blob)
               string   Q (where Q is as follows)
Q (0073-00b3):
         04 bb e6 6e 8e   b6 b4 f8 29 8f e2 b1 ba
a0 2f 24 a2 d6 33 74 d4   17 ce b2 17 73 da 95 1a

Server's ephemeral public key octet string (string Q_S):
Q_S (00b8-00f8):

2f 4a 18 ac d7 68 d7 df   0b
Signature on the exchange hash (string):
    string  ""ecdsa-sha2-nistp256"" (again where nistp256 is the [identifier])
    string   ecdsa_signature_blob
               mpint r (011c-013c):
                                      00 84 0a a1

           mpint s (0141-0161):

db 55 9f 5d e9 fa 48 87   b2 2e 97 3c 46 59 7a 14
c9 40
Hopefully this helps clear up the confusion.  You'll still have a bit of research to do with RFC5656 and possibly referring back to RFC4253 to fill in the blanks but that is the breakdown of the packet.
Good luck!

I just want to use SSL for encryption only and not authentication, which is why I am using the Diffie-Hellman anonymous cipher suites, but it is failing. 
I totally understand that anonymous cipher suites are not advisable and inherently insecure against man-in-the-middle attacks and probably I will not use it in production. But I would still like to find out what is wrong with my implementation that is preventing the ssl connection. Following is the excerpt of the code

    // commented out since Diffie-Hellman cipher suite should not require trust store or key-store, but the connection works only if I uncomment it.

    } catch (Exception e) {

If do specify the trust store, then the connection works fine when I uncomment the following lines:
props.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStore"", ""/truststore/cwallet.sso"");
props.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType"", ""SSO"");

But Diffie-Hellman cipher suite should not require truststore or keystore. So what am I doing wrong?
I do see the following in one of oracle docs:
http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/network.111/b28530/asossl.htm#i1009717
""There is a known bug in which an OCI client requires a wallet even when using a cipher suite with DH_ANON, which does not authenticate the client.""
However I am not using OCI client. Instead I am using JDBC (ojdbc6.jar). Does the same exist even in JDBC? If so what is the work around to use Diffie-Hellman cipher suite?
Thanks

var Alice = crypto.createDiffieHellman(512);
Alice.generateKeys();

//create a public & private key for bob

If i understood the right graphics on this wikipedia article right, then both secrets should be the same. But they never are, why?
","Ah well I already found the solution:
var crypto = require(""crypto"");

var prime = crypto.createDiffieHellman(512).getPrime();

Alice.generateKeys();

My question is how do i incoporate the DH algorithms that i coded in a servlet that is on a server that is hosted an apache tomcat.
I hope you guys can enlighten me with some example codes as i am really lost on this.
My servlet code is as follows below 
LoginServlet.java
>    public class LoginServlet extends HttpServlet {



protected void processRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        response.setContentType(""text/html;charset=UTF-8"");
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
        try {
        String un,pw;
        un=request.getParameter(""username"");
        pw=request.getParameter(""password"");
        if(un.equalsIgnoreCase(""hello"") && pw.equals(""world""))
        {
            out.print(1);
            System.out.println(un);
            System.out.println(pw);
        }
        else
        {
            out.print(0);
            System.out.println(un);
            System.out.println(pw);
        }
        } finally {            
            out.close();
        }
    }


    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        processRequest(request, response);


    }


    @Override
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        processRequest(request, response);
    }


    @Override
    public String getServletInfo() {
        return ""Short description"";
    }
}

Hope you guys can enlighten me on this issue. Thanks in advance! =)

Error: java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException: Inappropriate key specification

Seems like altough I use the same G and P in both programs, the keys generated in C++ are 128\20 byte long (public\private) while in java they are 426\362 byte long. I was wondering where I can set the desired key length in crypto++ but yet to discover that. Also I removed some helper function from the codes above, so I guess copy-paste and trying to compile them won't work. If anyone will actually want to do that I will submit my complete code.
Thanks

"41356625","Can someone tell me how to make a server choose a ECDH_* cipher over ECDHE_*?","I am using RSA cipher for signing the certificate and  SSL_CTX_set_tmp_ecdh_callback() api to set the ECDH parameters for key-exchange. The server always ends up choosing TLS_ECDHE_RSA_* cipher suite. If i make the client send only TLS_ECDH_* cipher suites in the clientHello, the server breaks the connection stating ""no shared cipher"".
Can someone tell me how to make a server choose a ECDH_* cipher over ECDHE_* ?
How is it that the server decides I should choose ECDH_* cipher over ECDHE_* ciphers ?
","Now that this is moved where it's ontopic, and clarified enough, and the partying is over:
Ephemeral ECDH suites: TLS suites that use ephemeral ECDH key exchange (ECDHE-*) use at least nominally ephemeral ECDH keys, which OpenSSL calls 'temporary'. OpenSSL through 1.0.2 has 4-6 ways of setting these keys:
SSL_CTX_set_tmp_ecdh or SSL_set_tmp_ecdh set (only) the 'curve' to be used; to be exact this is an EC_GROUP or formally 'parameter set' that consists of an actual curve defined by a curve equation on an underlying field, plus a specified base point which generates a subgroup on the curve of sufficiently high order and low cofactor, but most of the time we ignore this detail and just call it a 'curve'. OpenSSL then generates a random key on that curve for and during each handshake.
SSL_CTX_set_tmp_ecdh_callback or SSL_set_tmp_ecdh_callback sets a function that is called during each handshake and can either set a specific key, or set a curve and OpenSSL generates a random key on that curve.
SSL_CTX_set_ecdh_auto or SSL_set_ecdh_auto new in 1.0.2 causes OpenSSL during each handshake to choose a curve based on the client hello, and generate a random key on that curve.
Note that each ciphersuite using ECDHE also defines the type of key with matching certificate chain the server must use to authenticate: ECDHE-RSA must use an RSA key&cert while ECDHE-ECDSA must use an ECDSA key&cert (or to be precise EC key and ECDSA cert, since the same EC key can be used for ECDSA, ECDH, ECIES, and more, but usually shouldn't). OpenSSL library can be configured with multiple key&cert pairs, one of each type, and commandline s_server can do two static pairs using -cert -key -dcert -dkey plus one for SNI -cert2 -key2, but other programs may or may not.
However, in 1.1.0 these functions are removed and it appears OpenSSL always does what was formerly ecdh_auto.
Static ECDH suites: TLS suites that use static aka fixed ECDH key exchange (ECDH-*) use a static ECDH key and do not use an ephemeral or temporary ECDH key. Since they do not use a temporary key, the functions involved in setting a temporary curve or key are irrelevant and have no useful effect. Instead the static ECDH key must be in the server's configured key and certificate pair, and the certificate must allow ECDH i.e. it must not have keyUsage that excludes keyAgreement. In addition, in TLS 1.0 and 1.1 the configured certificate must be signed by a CA using a signature algorithm matching the ciphersuite: ECDH-ECDSA ciphersuites must use an ECDH cert signed by an ECDSA CA, and ECDH-RSA ciphersuites must use an ECDH cert signed by an RSA CA; see rfc4492 section 5.3. For TLS 1.2 rfc 5246 section 7.4.2 and A.7 for ECC relaxes this requirement and allows the CA cert to be any algorithm permitted by the client's signature_algorithms extension. However on checking I found OpenSSL doesn't implement this relaxation, so part of my earlier comment is wrong; even for 1.2 it requires the CA signature algorithm match the ciphersuite. 
In addition for all protocol versions the key and (EE) cert must use a curve supported by the client in supported_curves extension, and the cert must express that key in 'named' form (using an OID to identify the curve rather than explicit parameters) and a point format supported by the client in supported_formats extension. With OpenSSL client this is never an issue because it supports all named curves and point formats, and in practice certificates don't use explicit curve parameters.
Thus to get static ECDH with OpenSSL:

configure the server with an EC key (SSL_[CTX_]use_PrivateKey*) and matching certificate (SSL_[CTX_]use_certificate[_chain]*) that allows keyAgreement and is signed by a CA using RSA or ECDSA -- and like all PK-based ciphersuites also configure any chain certs needed by the client(s) to validate the cert
configure both ends to allow (which is true by default) and at least one end to require or the preference end to prefer ciphersuite(s) using ECDH-xyz where xyz is RSA or ECDSA to match the CA signature on the server cert
ignore ecdh_tmp and ecdh_auto entirely

... except in 1.1.0, which on checking I found no longer implements any static-ECDH or static-DH ciphersuites -- even though the static-DH suites are still in the manpage for ciphers. This is not in the CHANGES file that I can find, and I haven't had time to go through the code yet.

","As the comment got too long...
Diffie-hellman is just for key exchange over an unprotected connection, using a prime number math problem. It is used to initialize asynchronous encryption with public and private keys (as used early for SSL/TLS).
Unless required as an exercise (for which you should add a homework or exercise tag), DO NOT implement such security stuff yourself, use existing, well tested libraries. Java has builtin support for SSL (perhaps using other key exchange methods): SSLContext
Despite that, you could use those numbers to derive public and private keys, however, you must assure, that they're really large (and not just isProbablePrime) prime numbers, what can get slow with BigInteger.
To connect client and server, start with Socket. But again a disclaimer, if this is not an exercise, you WILL most probably be attacked (hacked, DDOSed,...), you're best using an existing, well tested and hardened server.

","The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is designed to generate a secret shared key.
By using large values of p, a and b, you ensure that the pool of potential shared keys is a very large one.
However, the actual value of the shared key can be any value within that pool. As a result, it could range from zero to (p - 1)... that's because, the Key is
G^(ab) mod p
Hence, you haven't discovered a problem here... your just seeing the instances when G^(ab) is close in value to a multiple of p, and hence the mod is a low number.

","Part of the point of D-H is that the secret key could be any value within the range specified by p. At least in theory, eliminating some of those possibilities would make it less secure, not more so (realistically, as long as you leave a sufficiently large pool of keys, it makes little real difference).
It is true that if an attacker decided to try key-exhaustion (brute-force) attack, and started from 0 and just counted up, they'd hit this one relatively soon. Then again, if you decided on some other lower bound and (for example) re-negotiated the key if it was below that bound, it wouldn't do any real good -- instead of starting at 0, the attacker would start at the specified lower bound, and you'd have gained nothing.

As I understand it, most web servers start Diffie-Hellman with the same default set of prime numbers, and this was later found to be a security flaw.  The fix is to generate new primes for your site's Diffie-Hellman key negotiation.  This page has details: https://weakdh.org/sysadmin.html

For example, I put mine in /etc/letsencrypt, so I ran

"36260101","BlueZ: LE secure pairing using Elliptical Curve Diffie-Hellman from command line","One of the main features of Bluetooth v4.2 is LE secure connections, where Elliptic Curve Diffie Helman (ECDH) is used for the key agreement protocol. As of BlueZ v5.26, support for LE secure connections has been added as follows:-
""BlueZ 5.26 is the first release with support for Blueooth 4.2 features. Perhaps the most notable one of these is Low Energy Secure Connections which will require a 3.19 or newer kernel.""[1]
Is there a way to test ECDH pairing through the command line? if not, what is the easiest way to test this?
I'm using BlueZ v5.38 on kernel 3.19 but I can't figure out how to do this. 
[1] http://www.bluez.org/release-of-bluez-5-26/
","In Linux, the secure connections feature using ECDH can be verified by performing pairing (using bluetoothctl) between two Bluetooth v4.2 devices and observing the output through btmon. Look for HCI Event: Link Key Notification and observe the Key type. If it shows P-256, then Secure Connections feature is verified. If it shows P-192, then it is using Secure Simple Pairing (SSP).
Additional background on this can be found in the Bluetooth Core Specification v4.2 in Vol 1, Part A, Section 5.1: Security Architecture.
I hope this helps.

The problem, however, is that I can't extract the shared secret without deriving it (ECDiffieHellmanCng.DeriveKeyMaterial(CngKey otherpartyPublicKey)).
Is there a way to directly access the shared secret (""k"" as it's called in the RFC papers)?
Here is page 7 from the RFC of the ECDH implementation and why I need the shared secret:

The exchange hash H is computed as the hash of the concatenation of
  the following.
string V_C, client's identification string (CR and LF excluded)
string   V_S, server's identification string (CR and LF excluded)
string   I_C, payload of the client's SSH_MSG_KEXINIT

","Even after a lot of research i couldn't find a way to do it so the answer is no - you can not extract the secret.
My solution for the big picture was to discard the ECDiffieHellmanCng class altogether and instead wrap the OpenSSH library in C#.

","You don't actually need k, then, you just need to compute H.  The ECDiffieHellman class allows you to do that.

Though that is using .NET 4.6.2 (currently in preview) API: DeriveKeyFromHash
If you are on an older framework it's still possible, but requires using the ECDiffieHellmanCng type specifically:

I can decode my peer's key from Base64 string to byte array, but how do I poke that into my original Public/Private Key EVP_KEY structure so it can be used with the EVP_PKEY_derive() to produce the shared key?
It's very unclear exactly what one should do to create the ""peerkey"" EVP_PKEY, but here's my code that takes a shot at it.
void CreateSharedKey(string &peerKey64)

I'm using phpecc and ECDiffieHellmanCng and trying to generate a shared secret between the two parties but I'm having issues with exporting/importing in C#.
It seems phpecc requires der/pem format in order to import a key, and ECDiffieHellmanCng doesn't seem to have any easy way to export in a compatible format.
Would I need to write my own pem/der encoder and decoder in order to do this or is there some alternative easier way?
Currently I'm doing the following in C#:
using (var ecdh = new ECDiffieHellmanCng())
        {
            ecdh.HashAlgorithm = CngAlgorithm.ECDiffieHellmanP384;
            ecdh.KeyDerivationFunction = ECDiffieHellmanKeyDerivationFunction.Hash;

            var encoded = EncodePem(ecdh.PublicKey.ToByteArray()); 
            //... do something with encoded
        }

private static string EncodePem(byte[] data)
    {
        var pemDat = new StringBuilder();
        var chunk = new char[64];

        pemDat.AppendLine(""-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----"");

        var encodedData = Convert.ToBase64String(data);
        for (var i = 0; i < encodedData.Length; i += chunk.Length)
        {
            var index = 0;
            while (index != chunk.Length && i + index < encodedData.Length)
            {
                chunk[index] = encodedData[i + index];
                index++;
            }
            pemDat.AppendLine(new string(chunk));
        }

        pemDat.AppendLine(""-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"");
        return pemDat.ToString();

Obviously the above is only doing the pem encoding, so on the php side it returns an error when it's trying to parse it:

",".NET Core 1.0 and .NET Framework 4.7 have the ECParameters struct to import/export keys.  The ToByteArray() method you called is producing a CNG EccPublicBlob which has very little to do with the SEC-1 ECParameters format.
I'm going to assume that you wanted to use secp384r1/NIST P-384, even though you specified that as a hash algorithm.  If you want some other curve, you'll need to do some translations.
The (.NET) ECParameters struct will only help you get started.  Turning that into a file requires translating it into a PEM-encoded DER-encoded ASN.1-based structure. (But if you're sticking with NIST P-256/384/521, you can do it with the byte[] you currently have)
In SEC 1 v2.0 we get the following structures:
SubjectPublicKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
  algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier {{ECPKAlgorithms}} (WITH COMPONENTS {algorithm, parameters}),
  subjectPublicKey BIT STRING
}

ECPKAlgorithms ALGORITHM ::= {
  ecPublicKeyType |
  ecPublicKeyTypeRestricted |
  ecPublicKeyTypeSupplemented |
  {OID ecdh PARMS ECDomainParameters {{SECGCurveNames}}} |
  {OID ecmqv PARMS ECDomainParameters {{SECGCurveNames}}},
  ...
}

ecPublicKeyType ALGORITHM ::= {
  OID id-ecPublicKey PARMS ECDomainParameters {{SECGCurveNames}}
}

ECDomainParameters{ECDOMAIN:IOSet} ::= CHOICE {
  specified SpecifiedECDomain,
  named ECDOMAIN.&id({IOSet}),
  implicitCA NULL
}

An elliptic curve point itself is represented by the following type
  ECPoint ::= OCTET STRING
whose value is the octet string obtained from the conversion routines given in Section 2.3.3.

Distilling this down to the relevant parts, you need to write
SEQUENCE (SubjectPublicKeyInfo)
  SEQUENCE (AlgorithmIdentifier)
    OBJECT IDENTIFIER id-ecPublicKey
    OBJECT IDENTIFIER secp384r1 (or whatever named curve you're using)
  BIT STRING
    public key encoded as ECPoint

The AlgorithmIdentifier contains data that's fixed given you don't change the curve:
SEQUENCE (AlgorithmIdentifier)
30 xx [yy [zz]]
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER id-ecPublicKey (1.2.840.10045.2.1)
   06 07 2A 86 48 CE 3D 02 01
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER secp384r1 (1.3.132.0.34)
   06 05 2B 81 04 00 22

and we can now count how many bytes were in the payload: 16 (0x10), so we fill in the length:
30 10 06 07  2A 86 48 CE   3D 02 01 06  05 2B 81 04
00 22

The public key encoding that everyone understands is ""uncompressed point"", which is
04 th eb yt es of x. th eb yt es of y.

Turns out, that has a fixed size for a given curve, too, so unlike most things that are DER encoded, you can do this in one pass :).  For secp384r1 the x and y coordinate are each 384 bit values, or (384 + 7)/8 == 48 bytes, so the ECPoint is 48 + 48 + 1 == 97 (0x61) bytes. Then it needs to be wrapped in a BIT STRING, which adds one payload byte and the length and tag. So, we get:
private static byte[] s_secp384r1PublicPrefix = {
    // SEQUENCE (SubjectPublicKeyInfo, 0x76 bytes)
    0x30, 0x76,
    // SEQUENCE (AlgorithmIdentifier, 0x10 bytes)
    0x30, 0x10,
    // OBJECT IDENTIFIER (id-ecPublicKey)
    0x06, 0x07, 0x2A, 0x86, 0x48, 0xCE, 0x3D, 0x02, 0x01,
    // OBJECT IDENTIFIER (secp384r1)
    0x06, 0x05, 0x2B, 0x81, 0x04, 0x00, 0x22,
    // BIT STRING, 0x61 content bytes, 0 unused bits.
    0x03, 0x62, 0x00,
    // Uncompressed EC point
    0x04,
}

...

using (ECDiffieHellman ecdh = ECDiffieHellman.Create())
{
    ecdh.KeySize = 384;

    byte[] prefix = s_secp384r1PublicPrefix;
    byte[] derPublicKey = new byte[120];
    Buffer.BlockCopy(prefix, 0, derPublicKey, 0, prefix.Length);

    byte[] cngBlob = ecdh.PublicKey.ToByteArray();
    Debug.Assert(cngBlob.Length == 104);

    Buffer.BlockCopy(cngBlob, 8, derPublicKey, prefix.Length, cngBlob.Length - 8);

    // Now move it to PEM
    StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
    builder.AppendLine(""-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----"");
    builder.AppendLine(
        Convert.ToBase64String(derPublicKey, Base64FormattingOptions.InsertLineBreaks));
    builder.AppendLine(""-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"");

    Console.WriteLine(builder.ToString());
}

Edit:
I've managed to solve this by using

But I faced another problems, The main problem is that calculated derived secret from these public keys is different in both peers!
Here is my secret derivation procedure which is the same in both peers and exactly copy and pasted (with some modification) from provided link, I made some comments for the modifications reason: 
unsigned char *derive_secret(EVP_PKEY *pkey,

    if(NULL == (secret = OPENSSL_malloc(*secret_len))) handleErrors();

    /* Derive the shared secret */
    if(1 != (EVP_PKEY_derive(ctx, secret, secret_len))) handleErrors();

    EVP_PKEY_CTX_free(ctx);
    EVP_PKEY_free(peerkey);
    EVP_PKEY_free(pkey);

    /* Never use a derived secret directly. Typically it is passed

    return secret;
}

I also printed out sent and received public keys on both side and made sure public keys are being received in one piece and exactly the same as they created and sent!
There is also some minor problem an that is when I figured that a long bytes of public keys are the same for both peers! Is that normal for a public key of EC diffie-helman?

","some bytes (prefix) the same: all public keys in X.509-format (more exactly, SubjectPublicKeyInfo) have at least an 'object identifier' (OID), which is the same for all keys of a given algorithm (like EC), and EC keys also have 'parameters' specifying a group/curve, which is the same for all keys on the same curve -- and keys for an ECDH agreement must be on the same curve. This identical data, combined with the fact that the actual pubkeys have different values but same size, results in the ASN.1 DER encodings starting with the same bytes.
The pubkey encodings you posted use the mostly-obsolete explicit curve specification, see rfc3279 sec 2.3.5 (equivalent to X9.62 or SEC1) which is much longer than the now-preferred and often required 'named' specification. At a guess, you used OpenSSL library below 1.1.0 to generate these keys and didn't set asn1_flag in the EC_GROUP object (or group subobject of EC_KEY) before serializing (aka encoding) with i2d (or PEM_write).
The wiki page you referenced sort of covers this in section 3 ""ECDH and Named Curves"" although it only mentions private keys when this also applies to public keys and certificates -- but public key and (then) certificate are derived from private key, so setting asn1_flag on private key is sufficient. And it doesn't say that 'named' is now the default in 1.1.0 and no longer needs to be explicitly set.
your newly-posted code: point_format is meaningful only when serializing (i2d or PEM_write) so setting it on a deserialized key that will only be used and free'd (not reserialized) is useless. OTOH setting the EC group to its existing value (which was set from deserialization) is useless, but setting it to any other value will cause chaos. EC public keys are points on a specific curve and different curves have entirely different points -- a value that is a point on one curve is not a point on another curve. Also, using a get1 function and not free'ing the result leaks memory.
derivation result different: that's quite wrong for (EC)DH, and I can't reproduce it. Below is your deriviation code with the few fixes indicated above and some tiny changes to match my coding style, plus the generation code from the wiki and a trivial main to drive them, and when I run this I get pubkeys with a common prefix (shorter due to using named form) but as expected the same derivation result:

I have on the terminal side the card public and private keys and the terminals public and private keys, and the same on the card side (i'm doing tests so thats why i have all of them on the terminal and on the card). When i generate KeyAgreement (terminal side) for the card as private and for the terminal as private the secters are the same, so the generation is OK and i get a 24 bytes (192 bit) secret. When i generate the the secrets on the card (2 cases like on the terminal) the secrets are also the same, but they ale shorter - 20 bytes (160 bit). Here are the generation codes. the terminal:
ECPublicKey publicKey;
ECPrivateKey privateKey;

...
KeyAgreement aKeyAgree = KeyAgreement.getInstance(""ECDH"", ""BC"");
aKeyAgree.init(privateKey);
aKeyAgree.doPhase(publicKey, true);
byte[] aSecret = aKeyAgree.generateSecret();

and the card side:
eyAgreement = KeyAgreement.getInstance(KeyAgreement.ALG_EC_SVDP_DH, false);
short length = terminalEcPublicKey.getW(array, (short) 0);

keyAgreement.init(cardEcPrivateKey);
short secretlength = keyAgreement.generateSecret(array, (short)0, length, buffer, (short)0);

","There is a problem in your implementation of KeyAgreement.ALG_EC_SVDP_DH in the terminal side. The correct length of output of the this method of key agreement should always be 20 bytes since SHA-1 is being performed on the derived output.
So in your terminal side, you should perform SHA-1 after generating the secret data.

"48783559","Diffie-Hellman key exchange between Crypto++ and Python","Consider the Diffie-Hellman key exchange between client and server, where the client application is written in c++ and the back-end is written in python.
The client application uses Crypto++ lib for crypto stuff and Python uses cryptography.
Here client application part where private and public key generate 
//domain parameters
OID CURVE = secp256k1();
AutoSeededX917RNG<AES> rng;
ECDH < ECP >::Domain dhA(CURVE);

// application private and publik key
SecByteBlock privA(dhA.PrivateKeyLength()), pubA(dhA.PublicKeyLength());
std::string privB64(R""(P3VfVpnSYcKQWX+6EZOly2XKy6no4UAB0cQhjBfyBD4=)"");
privA.Assign(reinterpret_cast<const byte*>(FromB64(privB64).c_str()), dhA.PrivateKeyLength());
dhA.GeneratePublicKey(rng, privA, pubA);

// serializa public key into integer
Integer intPub;
intPub.Decode(pubA.BytePtr(), pubA.SizeInBytes());
std::string ret;
intPub.DEREncode(CryptoPP::StringSink(ret));
std::cout << ToB64(ret);// the output is loaded into python

Now the question is that I don't know how to deserialize the public key into python EllipticCurvePublicKey. When I use cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_der_public_key()
I'm getting 
ValueError: Could not deserialize key data

Does anyone try to implement Diffie-Hellman key exchange between Crypto++ and Python using those two libraries?
","The issue was when serialized data in some way was transferred to backend how to recover it with Python EllipticCurvePublicKey type interface. Even if I decide to use protobuf the same question would arise.
But now I found the solution I'll put it here if anyone also will encounter this issue.
As I find out there is no interface to directly load Python EllipticCurvePublicKey object from Crypto++ SecByteBlock serialized object (which is representing the Diffie-Hellman public key in this scope).
To do this we need to convert public key into elliptic curve point and the serialize each coordinate of point (which is a big integer) in the way as you can see in this code snipped:
CryptoPP::DL_GroupParameters_EC<ECP> params(CURVE);    
CryptoPP::ECPPoint p = params.DecodeElement(pubA.BytePtr(), true);
std::cout << CryptoPP::IntToString(p.x) << std::endl;// this will be send to backend
std::cout << CryptoPP::IntToString(p.y) <<std::endl;

To recover the two integers (x and y coordinates of the point) in the Python code as a DH public key you need to do the following 
# assuming that the x and y values are from client side 
x = 109064308162845536717682288676453496629093274218806834681903624047410153913758

"51305689","Dart - secret key generation based on elliptic curve 25519","I am looking for a dart package in order to implement key exchange protocol (Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman) in a Flutter application. So the flow will be like this:

app generates a key pair during login and sends the public key to
server (so a new key pair is generated for every login)
server sends back its public key that it just generated
app generates a secret key from its private key and server's public
key
app includes the hmac of all subsequent messages sent to the server

I tried using the ed25519_dart package for the key generation, but it doesn't work. My app doesn't even start due to integer literal can't be represented in 64 bits error, which is also pointed out by the dart analyzer.
I also took a look at pointycastle, but it doesn't seem to support Diffie–Hellman. 
The Diffie–Hellman package also doesn't work for me. Provided example throws this exception in the first line: 
FormatException: Invalid radix-16 number

","The error I am assuming is connected to BigNum and Dart 2. Pointy Castle has a branch on GitHub where they are switching to Dart 2.0. 
Here are some ways you could get a keypair:

Use a native SDK (Java, Kotlin, or C++) and use a platform channel
Use the pointy castle Dart 2.0 branch
Try flutter_sodium package. It works with Dart 2 but is a work in progress.

Hopefully, this helps. I am trying to figure out the best way as well!

"37562264","How does Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman work on JavaCard, in combination with Java?","I'm trying to get Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman to work on a JavaCard (version 2.2.1).
On the JavaCard, I have the following code right now:
byte temp[] = new byte[100];
byte secret[] = new byte[100];
byte size = buf[ISO7816.OFFSET_LC];

Util.arrayCopy(buf, ISO7816.OFFSET_CDATA, temp, (byte) 0, size);

// the public key is in temp
short len = dh.generateSecret(temp, (byte) 0, size, secret, (byte) 0);

Util.arrayCopy(temp, (byte) 0, buf, ISO7816.OFFSET_CDATA, size);
//Util.arrayCopy(secret, (byte) 0, buf, ISO7816.OFFSET_CDATA, len);
apdu.setOutgoingAndSend(ISO7816.OFFSET_CDATA, size);

And I initialize dh as follows:
keyPair = new KeyPair(KeyPair.ALG_EC_FP, KeyBuilder.LENGTH_EC_F2M_163);
keyPair.genKeyPair();
dh = KeyAgreement.getInstance(KeyAgreement.ALG_EC_SVDP_DH, false);
dh.init(keyPair.getPrivate());

All of this seems to work, except for the dh.generateSecret call, where the applet simply seems to crash. If I leave the call out, and return other data, that works nicely. In which I import the data that is sent by the terminal. In the terminal, I have the following:
// generate an ecdh keypair
KeyPairGenerator keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""EC"");
keyGen.initialize(163);
KeyPair keyPair = keyGen.generateKeyPair();

// initialize DH
KeyAgreement dh = KeyAgreement.getInstance(""ECDH"");
dh.init(keyPair.getPrivate());

//byte encKey[] = keyPair.getPublic().getEncoded();

// X9.62 encoding, no compression
int qLength = (163+7)/8;
byte[] xArr = ((ECPublicKey) keyPair.getPublic()).getW().getAffineX().toByteArray();
byte[] yArr = ((ECPublicKey) keyPair.getPublic()).getW().getAffineY().toByteArray();
byte[] enc2 = new byte[1+2*qLength];
enc2[0] = (byte) 0x04;
System.arraycopy(xArr, 0, enc2, qLength - xArr.length, xArr.length);
System.arraycopy(yArr, 0, enc2, 2* qLength - yArr.length, yArr.length);

byte res[] =send((byte) 0x00, enc2).getData();

I have tried several things. Right now, the code that sends the public key tries to encode it in X9.62 encoding (uncompressed) as specified by the JavaCard docs. However, I've also tried the default encode method, which gives exactly the same result.
I don't seem to be able to get any error out of the JavaCard about what is going wrong. Does anyone know what is going wrong? Or does anyone have a working example on how to do a key-exchange on a JavaCard?
","As vojta already indicated:
keyPair = new KeyPair(KeyPair.ALG_EC_FP, KeyBuilder.LENGTH_EC_F2M_163);

just tries to generate a key pair, and it probably works up to a point. But an Fp curve is different from a F2m curve, and to my knowledge there are no 163 bit Fp curves (to my knowledge anyway).
This means that you never actually installed the domain parameters, unless you generated your own, and I would call that unlikely.
Use a Fp curve with a known key length and set the parameters, at least for the public key (for JCOP cards you may have to set them for the private key as well). You'd normally use a 224 bit key size or higher to be secure.

It would probably be better to print that in hex.
The public key is a point on the curve. That is, its an (x,y) coordinate. So that value probably needs to be split (hence the reason for printing in hex). Taking a guess:
x = 499599043529551953518354858381998373780
y = 459818901085313561109939106744612770290

The public key is a point because its derived from the base point G, which is also a point. G is sometimes expanded as (g_x, g_y). The private exponent is a (or b), which is a scalar or integer. So the public key is A=G^a or A=(g_x, g_y)^a, which is a point.


And also because the default format of point_conversion_form is :uncompressed, as I just have tested

Point conversion/compression is just a presentation layer optimization trick. It omits the y portion of the coordinate because you can solve for it given x. Because its a curve, sometimes you need to send +1 or -1 to specify the quadrant the y coordinate lies in. But again, its just an optimization and only matters for interop'ing. After you read the point into a library, both x and y are available.


You might wonder why I need to convert the public key into the other...

Nope :)
But one thing you might want to be aware of is OpenSSL's ""named curve"" flag. If you want to load an EC key into an OpenSSL based server, you will want to ensure the private key and resulting certificate have the OPENSSL_EC_NAMED_CURVE flag. Otherwise, you'll get bizarre errors like ""no shared ciphers"" when trying to connect to the server. See ECDH and Named Curves on the OpenSSL wiki for details.

","Jay-Ar, 
You shouldn't find your solution weird as I think the call to ec.public_key.to_bn might be adhering to rfc5480 section 2.2 re: Subject Public Keys which states:

2.2.  Subject Public Key

The first octet of the OCTET STRING indicates whether the key is
      compressed or uncompressed.  The uncompressed form is indicated
      by 0x04 and the compressed form is indicated by either 0x02 or
      0x03 (see 2.3.3 in [SEC1]).  The public key MUST be rejected if
      any other value is included in the first octet.


Assuming this is the case and since you stated the format is :uncompressed, your own answer makes total sense to me.  Thanks for posting it! :)

You convert int value to bytes here. This produces result like b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' that later cannot be directly casted to int even after decoding because it's not number in decimal form. There are 2 possible solutions:
1) Properly decode value, this line will interpret bytes object as int splitted into bytes:
B = int.from_bytes(B, byteorder='big', signed=False)  # instead of B = B.decode()

2) Convert your original int value to str before converting to bytes so back convertation will work

Notes:

I'm not aware of all the math behind elliptic curve keys, just the basic idea. I know that a curve has parameters like G and n (which are obtained via getG() and getN() methods) and that there are some ""standard pre-defined"" curves (like P-256) that you can get using ECNamedCurveTable.getParameterSpec().
You can take a look at all the math details if you want. There is also a list of different standard curves and which ones are considered secure.
ECPublicKey extends PublicKey, so you can use it just like a PublicKey

https://github.com/encryptogroup/MobilePSI/blob/master/PSIServer/src/PSIDH.java
I want to implement it in C++, so I thought of using OpenSSL
What I am trying to do
Here is roughly how it works:
let G be a generator for diffie hellman;
alice has a DH secret a and an element x,
bob has a DH secret b and an element y;
h is some function that takes any (bitstring) element and map it to an DH scalar.

alice sends G*a*h(x) (call it alice's side)
bob replies with (G*a*h(x))*b (call it final alice's side)
bob sends G*b*h(y) (call it bob's side)
alice computes (G*b*h(y))*a

Alice then compares both final values to learn whether x == y or not.
The code
(minimal working example)
Using the fact that G*a is what is ""Alice's public key"" regarding Diffie-Hellman.

Code Result and Problem
The result is:
final points are different
temp points are equal

I would expect the opposite:
final points should be equal because it's the same x on both sides
As to ""temp points are equal"", this is very disturbing:
it means that we have G*a*x == G*b*x ?
If you compare G*a with G*b (the public keys) the answer is that they are different, so what seems to happen is that multiplication by x with EC_POINT_mul just ""messes things up"".
Any idea what is happening ?
","The following code should do the job. The problem is passing wrong parameters to EC_POINT_mul(). See here for documentation of EC_POINT_mul().

","The public key value returned by crypto.DiffieHellman.getPublicKey() is just the raw DH number, optionally encoded in base64 or hex. It is not in (any) PEM format or even ASN.1/DER format (which could easily be turned into PEM). Similarly crypto.ECDH.getPublicKey() is only the point (in conventional X9.62 format), not any PEM or DER format.
Moreover, DH and ECDH are not encryption algorithms, they are key-agreement (or secret-agreement) algorithms, and that operation is performed by DiffieHellman.computeSecret() or ECDH.computeSecret() respectively. Although not clearly documented, publicEncrypt actually calls OpenSSL's EVP_PKEY_encrypt{_init,} which doesn't support DH or ECDH, only RSA (with several choices of padding) and possibly GOST-wrap (I can't easily verify that and it may well be version dependent because upstream OpenSSL as of 1.1.0 a few years ago dropped the GOST algorithms).

"46379624","C++ GMP random number generation for Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange","I need to calculate a private key (privateKey) for Diffie-Hellman key exchange. I have given a big prime prime and now I just need to choose a number that is less than p. This is my code:
        mpz_class privateKey;
        unsigned long seed;
        mpz_init(privateKey.get_mpz_t());

        gmp_randstate_t rstate;

        gmp_randseed_ui(rstate, seed);

        mpz_urandomm(privateKey.get_mpz_t(), rstate, prime.get_mpz_t());

I don't really understand why I'm always getting the same ""random"" number. 
","You never initialize the seed variable, so your program is obviously wrong and your compiler should have warned you about this. If it didn't, look up how to configure your compiler correctly (e.g. for GCC make sure you pass at least -O -Wall).
You'll always get the same random number if you initialize the RNG with the same seed. That's probably what's happening in your program: seed is not initialized, so its value is whatever was on the stack at this address previously, and that turns out to be always the same if you're calling this function in the same way.
Since this is a cryptographic application, you need to seed the random number generator with a high-entropy source. Ask your operating system for it (there's no way to generate entropy inside a program): read from /dev/urandom on Linux, call CryptGenRandom on Windows.
Also, since this is a cryptographic application, don't call gmp_randinit_mt. This creates a Mersenne twister, which is fast and good enough for a physics simulation, but not suitable for cryptography because its state can be reconstructed from its outputs. I'm not familiar with GMP, but looking at the documentation, I see that it offers several algorithms for random number generation but none are suitable for security applications. You can use the OS source like /dev/urandom or CryptGenRandom directly as a source of random bits, but then you'd need to use that to implement the gmp_randstate_t interface in order to hook it up with mpz_urandomm. I don't know how difficult that is.
If this is a school exercise, do whatever your teacher tells you. If this is for an actual application, use an existing cryptography library such as libtom, which comes with all you need to generate cryptographic-quality random numbers and to perform the Diffie-Hellman computations, is very easy to integrate into a project, and has a license that allows it to be integrated into any project.

"48118420","Server Side SSL using Diffie-Hellman in Python","I'm trying to set up a socket using Diffie-Hellman SSL, but can't seem find any documentation on how to do this. I notice that SSLContext in Python 3.3+ supports load_dh_params and set_ecdh_curve which suggests that using DH is possible.
I'm fairly new to using SSL so perhaps missing something obvious, but here's the code I'm using:
sock = socket.socket()
sock.bind((HOST, PORT))
sock.listen()
context = ssl.SSLContext(protocol=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS)
context.set_ecdh_curve('prime256v1')
ssock, address = self._server.accept()
ssock= context.wrap_socket(ssock, server_side=True)

When using this code, I get the error:
ssl.SSLError: [SSL: NO_SHARED_CIPHER] no shared cipher
I've tried setting the ciphers like the following:
context.set_ciphers('ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384')

but all the ciphers I've tried still throw up the same exception.
If anyone could point out where I'm going wrong or provide a working example of using DH SSL, it'd be much appreciated!
","A TLS cipher defines the key exchange, the authentication method, the symmetric encryption algorithm and the HMAC. The authentication method in the cipher you explicitly try to use is RSA, i.e. using a certificate with an RSA public key. If you instead use the default cipher set the authentication methods are either RSA or ECDSA. 
Both of these authentication methods need an appropriate certificate on the server side, i.e. with RSA or ECC public key. Since you have not configured any certificates these ciphers can not be used. This means in essence that from the ciphers the client has offered (which commonly also require certificate based authentication) none can be used for the connection, ergo NO_SHARED_CIPHER.
What you need to do: 

The recommended way is to setup a certificate on the server which is trusted by the client. See SSLContext.load_cert_chain.
Or you could use ciphers which don't require authentication, for example ADH-AES256-GCM-SHA384. Note that you would need to explicitly configure the cipher in the client too since by default TLS stacks don't use ciphers without authentication for security reasons since man in the middle attacks will not be detected this way.

"22483036","Why is the ECC-DH Symmetric Key Of This Site Different From OpenSSL","I am using (this site's) Javascript library and OpenSSL Ruby to compute the symmetric key of Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman. 
However, from my results, OpenSSL Ruby only generated one key unlike that on the site which has X and Y symmetric keys. I am baffled as my OpenSSL symmetric key doesn't match either one of those x and y on the site.
The symmetric(shared secret) keys I got using secp224r1 curve:
Ruby OpenSSL

My questions are:
1) Why does OpenSSL Ruby yields only one key while that size yields two keys: x and y (as I've assumed x and y won't be concatenated with each other since the bitsize will be too long when compared to the Ruby symmetric key)
2) Is there a way to convert the two symmetric keys (OpenSSL and JSBN-EC library above) from one another? All my attempts to convert failed.
I've been struggling for a week now implementing Ruby OpenSSL with that JSBN-EC library. I've also tried (SJCL library) but similar results (symmetric keys don't match). Please help.
","I've managed to work it out now with working symmetric keys on client (JSBN-EC) and on server OpenSSL Ruby
I found out that my problem actually lies in the code itself. After fixing it, I've ended up with a symmetric key on OpenSSL Ruby as follows:
#Ruby: OpenSSL
...
...
symm_key = ec.dh_compute_key(point)
symm_key.unpack('B*').first.to_i(2) #Converts to binary, then to integer
#--> 6922380353406615622038660570577625762884344085425862813095878420328

While on the client side using JSBN-EC
#Javascript: JSBN-EC
...
...
var curve = get_curve();
var P = new ECPointFp(curve,
curve.fromBigInteger(server_pub_key_x),
curve.fromBigInteger(server_pub_key_y));
var a = client_priv_key;
var S = P.multiply(a);

console.log('SYMM_KEY X: '+S.getX().toBigInteger().toString());
//--> 6922380353406615622038660570577625762884344085425862813095878420328

Therefore from the looks of it, the symmetric key that matches the Ruby OpenSSL value is the  X value of the JSBN-EC symmetric key
6922380353406615622038660570577625762884344085425862813095878420328

","Are credentials stored in your app unique per user, i.e. every user gets it own apk with unique credentials? If you only have one apk with same credentials then this is as good as no security. Even worse, it gives false feeling of security.
You (your employer) should really hire a security expert to design your system from security point of view.
Here's what I'd do:

App comes without security credentials. 
Every user is generated security credentials on server.
Every user gets secret activation code which is generated in secure environment and delivered via alternative channel. Preferably via snail mail. Activation codes are time-limited and can be used only one time.
On first use user types into app the activation code which enables a one-time download of credentials over a secure (https) channel.
User provides password to encrypt the credentials while stored on device.
Every time the app is used user must provide this paswword. If app is not used for some time the app must timeout the session and ask for password again when user wants access.

But don't take my word for granted. You still need a security expert if there are financial transactions involved.

","I am not an expert and never worked with DH in java but after seeing your logs and little exploration of the code at DHKeyPairGenerator Grepcode it is really very clear in both the initialize function that it will always throw exception if Prime size < 512 as it is in written in code,
83         if ((keysize < 512) || (keysize > 1024) || (keysize % 64 != 0)) {
84             throw new InvalidParameterException(""Keysize must be multiple ""
85                                                 + ""of 64, and can only range ""
86                                                 + ""from 512 to 1024 ""
87                                                 + ""(inclusive)"");
88         }

and    
118    if ((pSize < 512) || (pSize > 1024) ||
119            (pSize % 64 != 0)) {

122                 + ""from 512 to 1024 (inclusive)"");
123        }

So it's for sure that you can not use these standard libraries for 480-bit key length.
It might be available in some other libraries which you need to explore, we used bouncycastle libraries to do some encryption stuff that might have those capabilities. 
I little researched and found the same DHKeyPairGenerator class in bouncycastle package with no constraints and checks on key size.

I know that the JDK has limitations around the max size but this issue seems to be the other way around. The key size is too small and not a multiple of 64. 
I've written a SSCCE to illustrate this behaviour and after two days of hunting, I'm at my wit's end.

","Disclaimer: I'm the maintainer of AsyncHttpClient (please, don't call it Ning).
Fun fact: this does work with AHC's JDK provider when running with JDK8, but not with JDK7!
Now: AHC JDK provider (which is a mere toy that is going away in AHC2, you shouldn't use it) boils down to Http(s)UrlConnection, so it's expected to get the same results.
Then, NIO based clients such as the other AHC providers, and Apache HttpComponents can't use the underlying HTTPS components that are being used by HttpsUrlConnection, because they are not public!
So they have to directly use javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine. But, this API was intended for generic TLS, not for the protocols built on top of it such as HTTPS.
For example, before JDK7, this cause a huge security issue on all Java NIO based HTTP clients, because they didn't have a way to properly perform hostname verification. Hostname verification is specific to HTTPS, so you can pass a HostnameVerifier to HttpsUrlConnection (HTTPS specific), but not to SSLEngine (generic TLS).
Now, since JDK7, we can finally configure a protocol (HTTPS or LDAP) on the SSLEngine so it takes care of the HTTPS specific behavior. But still, you have way less control than with HttpsUrlConnection.
Here, it seems that you found a JDK bug, and that HttpsUrlConnection and SSLEngine w/ HTTPS protocol enabled don't behave the same way.
For example, whatever I do (whatever cyphersuites I enable), I can't manage to get the BadSSL.com server pick TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, which is the one HttpsUrlConnection picks. It always pick TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 instead (no elliptic curve). See ServerHello when enabling TLS debug (-Djavax.net.debug=all).

I did not try to go further this, because it is not working and it is the very beginning of dhm algorithm. The function mbedtls_ctr_drbg_seed is returning MBEDTLS_ERR_CTR_DRBG_ENTROPY_SOURCE_FAILED.
Also in the ctr_drbg.h I had to edit the MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_MAX_SEED_INPUT from 384(default) to 336, otherwise the code would crash. Everything else is default.
Someone knows why is returning this error?
Thanks in advance.
Note: Im calling this function in main. Running the code gives me no errors.

1) Are my assumptions correct that 'a' is the secret number on my side and 'b' is the secret number on their side?
2) Given the example data, am I correct in transforming the hex representation to a decimal value? Here are my results:

3) Do these values make sense when it comes to computing the result? I am having a hard time getting this function to work with such large numbers:
A = g^a mod p 
Given that 'a' is some 308 digits long, it seems too large to make any sense. I cannot set such a large number as the exponent on the BigInteger as it will only allow me to pass an int value, where my 'a' is most definitely out of range. 
","You are correct on your first two questions.
For the 3rd one, use the modPow(BigInteger exponent, BigInteger modulo), so
BigInteger A = g.modPow(a,p);

The problem occurs on our test environment only. The settings there are same as prod environments. Just OpenSSH version differs - it is newer on test.

        Channel channel = null;
        ChannelSftp c = null;

            channel.connect();
            c = (ChannelSftp)channel;

The returned code of -2146892963 is not in the list of enumerated returned codes for the InitializeSecurityContext method. Any idea what this means and how to fix it?
","So, after weeks of searching, I found out what the error code is.
My problem is the method was returning the code in decimal form and I should have been searching for the hex code, which is 8009035D. Searching for that error code resulted in this article: https://www.nsoftware.com/kb/xml/06101501.rst#8009035D, indicating that this particular error code could be related to Windows blocking weak security. 
In my case, this is exactly what my problem was. I made the registry entry change given by the article, allowing for DHE Key length of 512 instead of the default 1024. After restarting the webserver, I was able to consume the company's webservice. 
It turns out that this particular company was using a DHE key length of 768, resulting in the error. 
As for fixing the problem, I feel the registry entry change should only be used to verify that this is the problem. I am currently in the process of updating this webservice to use TLS1.2, which seems to force the company to use a different algorithm.

","Diffie-Hellman key exchange, also called exponential key exchange, is a method of digital encryption that uses numbers raised to specific powers to produce decryption keys on the basis of components that are never directly transmitted, making the task of a would-be code breaker mathematically overwhelming.
The most serious limitation of Diffie-Hellman in its basic or ""pure"" form is the lack of authentication. Communications using Diffie-Hellman all by itself are vulnerable to man in the middle attacks. Ideally, Diffie-Hellman should be used in conjunction with a recognized authentication method such as digital signatures to verify the identities of the users over the public communications medium.

","DH is fine for this purpose, just make to sure to use 2048 bit keys or more.
However for VoIP the standards are TLS with SRTP/zrtp so it would be better if you would implement these. With DH you loose compatibility and will introduce a lot of complications. Also note that DH is only for key exchange, so you will need something also for the encryption itself. With TLS you could handle all these in one step by using a well know implementation instead to write your own encryption stack from scratch.

            org.spongycastle.jce.spec.ECParameterSpec ecSpec = ECNamedCurveTable.getParameterSpec(""prime192v1"");
            g.initialize(ecSpec, new SecureRandom());

            KeyPair kp1 = g.generateKeyPair();
            KeyPair kp2 = g.generateKeyPair();

            // Alice generated this
            byte[] privK1 = kp1.getPrivate().getEncoded();
            byte[] pubK1= kp1.getPrivate().getEncoded();

            // Bob generated this

        }catch(Exception e)
        {
            Log.e(LOGTAG, ""Exception caught in ECDHInit function"");
        }

now lets assume Alice and Bob save their private keys locally, exchange pubK1 and pubK2 and want to proceed with setting a shared secret (they have both keys now in byte[] format). I will describe only case of Alice, as for Bob this is identical:
KeyAgreement keyAgreement = KeyAgreement.getInstance(""ECDH"", ""SC"");

PrivateKey privateKey = KeyFactory.getInstance(""ECDH"", ""SC"").generatePrivate(new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(privK1));
PublicKey publicKey = KeyFactory.getInstance(""ECDH"", ""SC"").generatePublic(new X509EncodedKeySpec(pubK2));

Here comes my question - 
using the following code, I manage to get same shared secret for both Alice and Bob                 
keyAgreement.init(privateKey);
keyAgreement.doPhase(publicKey, true);

byte[] sharedSecret = SHA256(keyAgreement.generateSecret());

but I specify nowhere my special curve prime192v1
If I try to supply this in this way:
org.spongycastle.jce.spec.ECParameterSpec ecSpec = ECNamedCurveTable.getParameterSpec(""prime192v1"");

keyAgreement.init(privateKey, ecSpec);
keyAgreement.doPhase(publicKey, true);

byte[] sharedSecret = SHA256(keyAgreement.generateSecret());

an Exception is thrown saying
java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: No algorithm parameters supported

Why can't I supply my desired parameter? Does the KeyAgreement somehow deduce this from the private key?
Thanks!
","So it turns out I had the answer right there in front of me in the Android Studio debugger. Upon inspecting PrivateKey object I found internal member privateKey.ecSpec which contains all the details of selected curve. So passing arguments is unnecessary and throws an error, use the code without providing additional ecSpec

Need help how can i configure certificate for Server and also steps to set up tomcat server.
","By definition, anonymous DH cipher suites don't require authentication of either parties. Hence, they don't use a certificate at all. You don't need to set a keystore in this case. It doesn't make any sense to create a certificate for anonymous DH.
(The lack of keystore is in fact one of the cause for the ""no cipher suites in common"" message when you're not using anonymous DH cipher suites, which are sensibly disabled by default.)
If you want to use anonymous DH cipher suites, it's the cipher suites you need to configure (see the names with anon in the list of cipher suites disabled by default).
Note that they're disabled by default for a good reason: they make the connection vulnerable to MITM attacks. If you want the connection to be secure, you should always at least have the client verify the identity of the server (by configuring a certificate on the server).

I have prime number (p), generator (g), private key of user A and public key of user B. I need to compute the shared key. I wrote this code, but the code is executed till this line
 int dhSize = DH_size(dh->priv_key);

Here is the full code:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <openssl/dh.h>

const char* userA_PrivateKey = ""90ff0"";
const char* userB_PublicKey = ""9d1a59"";
const char* p = ""66c2fa"";

int main(void)

    BN_hex2bn(&dh->p, p);
    BN_hex2bn(&dh->priv_key, userA_PrivateKey);

    BIGNUM *pubKeyUserB = NULL;
    BN_dec2bn(&pubKeyUserB, userB_PublicKey);

    }

    return 0;
}

I have two problems:
1) printf, that prints dhSize is not executed at all
2) I am not sure if I set values g, p, priv key correctly ? Will the function DH_compute_key use my g and p ? 
","You are making silly mistakes:

dhSize should be typed as DH_size (~line 24)
and DH_size function calculates size of struct DH given a const struct DH * you are passing it dh->priv_key instead of passing it dh (~line 28)
Similar mistake in use of DH_compute_key (~line 28) third argument should be dh not dh->priv_key.

","The problem is that you are not using the correct BigInteger constructor. The BigInteger byte array constructor is designed to reconstruct a BigInteger from the output of BigInteger.toByteArray(). Java represents BigIntegers in byte arrays using something similar to a twos-complement scheme. As a result, a negative BigInteger is represented by a byte array whose high order byte (the 0'th byte of the array) is >= 128. A positive BigInteger is always represented by a byte array whose high-order byte is < 128. If the true high-order byte of a positive BigInteger would be >= 128 then BigInteger.toByteArray() emits a byte array with a leading 0 byte.
Thus you have two ways to solve your problem. You can prepend a zero byte to your array and use the same BigInteger constructor you have been using, or you can instead use the BigInteger sign-magnitude constructor with your byte array as is.
Here is an example using your byte array showing the differences.

Given that for public key I have only X and Y coordinates. How to generate publicKey from this values?
ECDH.Agree(key,privateKey, getPublicKey(X,Y))

{x,y} is a point on the curve, but its never been easy to work with it directly.
This is all we really want to do but it does not work. The problem is ECDH::Domain are only domain parameters. The public point and the private exponent are layered on top.
OID curve = ASN1::secp256r1();
DL_GroupParameters_EC<ECP> params(curve);

Integer x(""..."");
Integer y(""..."");
ECP::Point q(x, y);

DL_PublicKey_EC<ECP> pubKey;
pubKey.Initialize(params, q);

ECDH < ECP >::Domain theirs(pubKey);

To further complicate matters, the keys produced by the ECDH protocol are temporary or ephemeral. They are not meant to be persisted; rather, they are meant to be used once and discarded. So Crypto++ does not make it easy to persist them (by, say, providing a DEREncode).
Analysis
To use the {x,y} coordinate, we need to figure out how the library is using it. The ephemeral public and private keys are created in pubkey.h around line 1380. The code for them is below:
void GeneratePrivateKey(RandomNumberGenerator &rng, byte *privateKey)
{
    Integer x(rng, Integer::One(), GetAbstractGroupParameters().GetMaxExponent());
    x.Encode(privateKey, PrivateKeyLength());
}

void GeneratePublicKey(RandomNumberGenerator &rng, const byte *privateKey, byte *publicKey)
{
    const DL_GroupParameters<T> &params = GetAbstractGroupParameters();
    Integer x(privateKey, PrivateKeyLength());
    Element y = params.ExponentiateBase(x);
    params.EncodeElement(true, y, publicKey);
}

The line of interest above is the params.EncodeElement(true, y, publicKey). To see what's going on there, we need to look at eccrypto.h around line 70, and note that reversible is true:
void EncodeElement(bool reversible, const Element &element, byte *encoded)
{
    if (reversible)
        GetCurve().EncodePoint(encoded, element, m_compress);
    else
        element.x.Encode(encoded, GetEncodedElementSize(false));
}

params.EncodeElement calls ECP::EncodePoint. To see what that does we can examine ecp.cpp around line 120. The routine writes a uncompressed point, but blocks x and y on the maximum size of the public element, which should be the field size or the subgroup order.
void ECP::EncodePoint(BufferedTransformation &bt, const Point &P, bool compressed)
{
    if (P.identity)
        NullStore().TransferTo(bt, EncodedPointSize(compressed));
    else if (compressed)
    {
        bt.Put(2 + P.y.GetBit(0));
        P.x.Encode(bt, GetField().MaxElementByteLength());
    }
    else
    {
        unsigned int len = GetField().MaxElementByteLength();
        bt.Put(4);      // uncompressed
        P.x.Encode(bt, len);
        P.y.Encode(bt, len);
    }
}

Don't worry too much about the BufferedTransformation. There are ways to turn a byte[] into one, and it happened before the code shown above. If you trace the code, you will see its transformed via an ArraySource:
byte myArray[PublicEphemeralKeyLength()];
ArraySource as(myArray, COUNTOF(myArray));

Above, as is a BufferedTransformation that wraps the byte[] you passed into the function.
The final open question is the maximum size of the field element. That appears to be the modulus size less one, in bytes:
$ grep -I -A 1 MaxElementByteLength modarith.h 
    unsigned int MaxElementByteLength() const
        {return (m_modulus-1).ByteCount();}

Agreement
Given the above information, here's what you should do. You need to supply the values for x and y in ECP::Point q(x,y). They are just Crypto++ Integers.
OID curve = ASN1::secp256r1();
DL_GroupParameters_EC<ECP> params(curve);

size_t size = params.GetEncodedElementSize(true);
vector<byte> othersPublicKey(size);

ECP::Point q(x,y);
params.EncodeElement(true, q, &othersPublicKey[0]);

Then you can call:
ecdh.Agree(key, myPrivateKey, &othersPublicKey[0]);

One note: params.GetEncodedElementSize(true) should equal PublicEphemeralKeyLength(). If they are not equal, then something is wrong.

If you need to modify compression, then you can:
params.SetPointCompression(true);

"43661747","I have general questions about Diffie Hellman parameters","I am currently working on Diffie-Hellman Key exchange and use the key pairs for AES.
Q1) When I choose prime for Diffie-Hellman from RFC 3526 such as 1536, 2048, 3072 MODP groups, is bigger prime safer? could you explain me about it?
Q2) Each group all has generator of 2, should I always use 2 as generator if I use standard prime group from RFC3526??
Q3) I am using the key pairs from Diffie-Helman for AES. I understand that AES's key length can be 128, 192 or 256 bits. Should I choose specific prime or generator in Diffie-Hellman to meet the key lengths of 128, 192 or 256 bit for AES??
Sorry ask three questions in a single post but I believe that they are all related questions. Thanks!!
","In RFC 3528, they address your questions in section 8, Security Considerations. I will attempt to restate/explain the answers here:

In short, yes, the bigger prime is ""safer"". Assuming that Diffie-Hellman is not fundamentally broken, the difficulty of ""cracking"" the exchange, i.e. finding out the shared key the exchange establishes, scales directly with the size of the primes used. However, one additional bit of prime does not equal one additional bit of ""key strength"" in AES terms. This is because, simply, not every number is prime. In AES-128, for example, we expect the key to be a string of 128 random bits, meaning that the key could be any one of 2^128 possibilities. Yet we would never use a 128-bit prime in Diffie-Hellman (or RSA, or anything else that requires primes) simply because there are much fewer than 2^128 primes that are 128 bits in length. So if we used a 128-bit prime, an attacker wouldn't have to try all of the 2^128 possibilities, they would only have to try the much smaller number of 128-bit primes. Therefore, in order to say we have the same ""key-strength"" as AES-x, we need to use much, much larger primes, so that we have a number of possible primes in the range of 2^x.
I would say yes. When in doubt, follow the reference implementation; in this case, use 2 as the generator.
The table in section 8 shows the ""strength estimate"" of the various prime groups provided; I would always take the lower estimate of their strength. So for AES-128, use at least the 3072-bit group; for AES-192, at least the 8192-bit group.

I'm using Axis2 to call a web service. I also have the ""Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files"" in jre/lib/security (but as someone mentioned on the other post this didn't work for them).
For reproducing this issue I'm trying to host a web service in a separate deployment with a similar environment (also using Axis2). This has a custom SSLServerSocketFactory which is creating and configuring the SSLServerSocket.
Using Wireshark (and also javax.net.debug JVM argument) I can see that the cipher suite that is negotiated is TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA but the Prime DH Server Param in the ServerKeyExchange is only 96 bytes (768 bits).
Is there any way I can configure the SSLServerSocket to use a larger prime during the handshake?
I'm guessing the key is being generated by the security provider for RSA from the JRE. Do I need to add my own provider and add it to jre/lib/security/java.security?
Appologies if this is a silly question, I'm new to DHE an Cipher Suites in general. I just need to know enough to get the server test to work (I'm not touching the client implementation).
","So with the push in the right direction from EJP I eventually managed to track down exactly where the strength (and subsequently the DH parameters) is determined. It is indeed in the JRE (specifically in the ServerHandshaker).
Using the security providers with an older JRE with the strength limitation (as mentioned in the original post) will not work here. While using other security providers will probably prevent this error client side the strength is already determined before the implementation of the KeyPairGenerator is initialized.
As a side note I didn't bother upgrading the JRE to reproduce this. I just added the BouncyCastle JCE provider with debug info, put a breakpoint in the org.bouncycastle.jcajce.provider.asymmetric.dh.KeyPairGeneratorSpi.initialize(int, SecureRandom) method and manually changed the strength. This was good enough for my tests.

","The ""E"" in DHE is for ephemeral. It means transient, fleeting, or temporary. The key material that you need to decrypt the conversation is not permanently stored anywhere.

size_t size = 557; // 556 + NULL terminating byte per the docs.

mbedtls_dhm_context ctx;
mbedtls_dhm_init(&ctx);
int res = mbedtls_dhm_parse_dhm(&ctx, buf, size);

if (res != 0) {
    printf(""FAIL\n"", -res);
}

res results in a negative, non-zero value (0xffffcc1e). I've checked the error codes for x509 parsing in mbedtls, but can't find a matching error code.
Any idea why I can't load this certificate? 
Update
I updated my C code to print out the associated error message for mbedtls:
0x0000023c4f9fb2b0 ""DHM - The ASN.1 data is not formatted correctly : ASN1 - ASN1 tag was of an unexpected value""

So I took the hex values from my key and ran it through http://lapo.it/asn1js/ (<-- That links the the actual output from the key) which indicates some structure to my key and seems to parse the key just fine. Perhaps it's an issue with how I'm passing the key to mbedtls?
","You are passing the wrong thing to mbed TLS's mbedtls_dhm_parse_dhm. That function expects the DER (or PEM) encoded DH parameters, not the key.
Using BouncyCastle's DHParameter you can get the DER encoded parameters like this:
DHParameterSpec dhParams = ((DHPublicKey) aliceKeyPair.getPublic()).getParams();
DHParameter dhP = new DHParameter(dhParams.getP(), dhParams.getG(), 0);
byte[] encodedParams = dhP.getEncoded(ASN1Encodable.DER);

This will give you the bytes that you can then pass into mbedtls_dhm_parse_dhm, either as raw bytes as you are doing now or PEM encoded as that function will accept that as well. Note that I'm passing 0 for L as mbed TLS discards it anyway. Also note that getEncoded throws so make sure to handle the exception.
Steps to complete a key exchange:
In Java:
KeyPairGenerator aliceKpairGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""DH"");
aliceKpairGen.initialize(2048);
KeyPair aliceKpair = aliceKpairGen.generateKeyPair();
KeyAgreement aliceKeyAgree = KeyAgreement.getInstance(""DH"");
aliceKeyAgree.init(aliceKpair.getPrivate());
DHParameterSpec dhParams = ((DHPublicKey) aliceKpair.getPublic()).getParams();
DHParameter dhP = new DHParameter(dhParams.getP(), dhParams.getG(), 0);
byte[] encodedParams = dhP.getEncoded(ASN1Encodable.DER);
byte[] javaPub = ((DHPublicKey)aliceKeyPair.getPublic()).getY().toByteArray();

Then in C++:
mbedtls_dhm_context ctx;
mbedtls_dhm_init(&ctx);
...
mbedtls_dhm_parse_dhm(&ctx, encodedParams, encodedParamsLen);
...
uint_8t mbedtlspub[128];
mbedtls_dhm_make_public(&ctx, 128, mbedtlspub, sizeof(mbedtlspub), mbedtls_ctr_drbg_random, &rnd_info);
...
mbedtls_dhm_read_public(&ctx, javaPub, javaPubLen);
...
uint_8t mbedtlssecret[128];
mbedtls_dhm_calc_secret(&ctx, mbedtlssecret, (size_t)secret_len, &olen, mbedtls_ctr_drbg_random, &rnd_info);

And back in Java (assuming you encoded mbedtlspub from the previous steps in Base64, but you can do it however you want):
byte[] yBinary = Base64.decodeBase64(mbedtlspub.getBytes()); 
BigInteger y = new BigInteger(yBinary); 
DHPublicKeySpec dhPublicKeySpec = new DHPublicKeySpec(y, dhParams.getP(), dhParams.getG()); 
KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(ALGORITHM); 
DHPublicKey mbedtlsPubKey = (DHPublicKey) KeyFactory.generatePublic(dhPublicKeySpec);
aliceKeyAgree.doPhase(mbedtlsPubKey, true);
byte[] javaSecretKey = aliceKeyAgree.generateSecret();

That completes the key exchange and at this point mbedtlssecret and javaSecretKey should match. So the data passing hands is encodedParams and javaPub (from Java) and mbedtlspub (from C++). I omitted some detail to focus on the core steps. Also note that a lot of these functions either return an error code or throw, so please take care using them.

"51831922","SSL handshake failure with Linux server, but not with Windows","I've found some related questions, but mine is a little different.
Client app running on Windows, using Java 1.7 (71) with bouncycastle connecting to a tomcat 8.5.xx server running Java 1.8 (161) on either Linux RH or Windows 10. The Linux and Windows server installations should be identical (other than being Linux and Windows). We control the software on both sides.
Client app works correctly when connecting to Windows. When connecting to Linux it fails the SSL handshake with:
java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: Prime size must be multiple of 64, and can only range from 512 to 1024 (inclusive)
  at com.sun.crypto.provider.DHKeyPairGenerator.initialize(DHKeyPairGenerator.java:120)
  at java.security.KeyPairGenerator$Delegate.initialize(Unknown Source)

This isn't totally surprising, because Java 7 can't handle large DH keys. But
when the client connects to the Windows server (same version of tomcat, same version of Java), the SSL handshake works flawlessly and the connection goes through.
Setting javax.net.debug appropriately shows that, yes, the Linux server is sending a 2048 bit DH key and Windows is sending 1024. I have no idea why.
The java.security files are the same for the Windows and Linux server (except windows has sun.security.mscapi.SunMSCAPI provider). crypto.policy=unlimited is commented out on both.
Two part question:

Where else can I look to find out why the two systems behave differently? Is this an OS crypto library difference?
Is there a way to resolve this problem without changing the client code (it's legacy code and we'd rather not patch)?

It's also not clear to me how I get the X and Y values from the bouncy castle public key that I generate to send back to them.
It doesn't help that the bouncy castle for .net api is not exactly the same as the java api and the documentation is limited.

In practice, does this mean I never need a certificate? Or that means I need a new cert every single time?

It means that the generation of the key is independent of the certificate.
You could use DH without certificate (anonymous DH), but than the connection would be open to man-in-the-middle attacks. Thus in practices DH is used for key generation but the certificate is still used to make sure we talk to the right peer (identification).

The client will then send the encrypted OTP to the server and the server checks if it matches with the one it generates. I am not sure if the operations can be carried out together 
","first of all you need to execute hellman key exchange and generate shared secret key between server and client. then after client take the key and perform encryption using shared secret key with some encryption algorithm and send it to server server decrypt the data. so you can generate shared secrete key one time for all encryption or you can generate all time. but i can suggest you use asymmetric key cryptography(RSA, ECC) it will reduce overhead of  hellman key exchange. and it will more secure as compare with symmetric key cryptography.

Before I swapped the ordering, and included the .Concat(new byte[] { 0 }).ToArray() from your original question, the output was:
True
True
True
False

And now it's:
True
True
False
True

The other issue you're seeing is BigInteger.Parse and the Byte[] constructor always expect the top bit of the first nibble or last byte respectively to be the sign bit. So you need to include the extra 0 character or byte respectively to avoid that.

We already have a full network running using Ruby. We're trying to use AES 256 CBC using the OpenSSL library. We have experimented with using Diffie Hellman, but this is where we're having trouble:
node 1 runs:
require 'openssl'
dh1 = OpenSSL::PKey::DH(256)
der = dh1.public_key.to_der
###we would send der to n2 here

Apparently it's alright to send der over to n2, so n2 would have this portion of code:
require 'openssl'
dh2 = OpenSSL::PKey::DH(der)

and now they have each others' information. However wouldn't a node which was listening to traffic be able to pick this message up and be able to have dh1's key? Having trouble wrapping my head around this.
","Yes a listening node could have dh1's public key. That is how Diffie Hellman works. The eavesdropper does not know either private key and does not know the shared private key. Without knowing one of the private keys it cannot solve for the shared key.
The modulo equations are setup such that when dh2 raises dh1's public key to the value of its own private key (dh1_public_key^dh2_private_key) the result of the equation is the shared key, and vice versa.

"48032215","Explanation of Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange using colors?","I was checking this explanation of Diffie-Hellman algorithm using colors.
Alice and Bob want to communicate privately.

A Common Color C is agreed upon by Alice and Bob.
Eve knows about the C because it is communicated over the Network.
Alice mixes her Private Color A to C and sends Alice's Mixture AC over the Network.
Bob mixes his Private Color B to Yellow and sends Bob' Mixture BC over the Network.
Alice and Bob add their own color to the other's mixture BCA = ACB.
They arrive at a common, color.

However, I have the following question?
If Eve knows that the common color is C, and Alice's Mixture AC, can't she deduce Alice's secret color using AC - C? At-least in RGB color space, this is easy to calculate right?
In summary, will this algorithm work if the common color C is shared over the network?
PS: I am assuming that volume of the colors is the same as the video doesn't talk about quantity.
","Short answer: Yes, it will work. That is kind of the whole point of this concept. 
As for that particular explanation (using paint as an example), it is just that - a simplified example to make the higher level concept understandable. 
That higher level concept is in this case, that certain known pieces of data (the known color) can be combined with private / unknown pieces of data (the two ""private"" colors that are added by Alice and Bob) in such a way that only the intended parties (Alice and Bob) can make use of the resulting product. 
In this simplified example, that resulting product is a secret color. In actual cryptography, the result is a secret message of some kind. 
The paint is a metaphor. You should not try to over-analyze it. If you are thinking about RGB-codes and volumes of colored liquids, I'm afraid you're missing the point.

Addition/ update: For a slightly more technical description of the Diffie-Hellman exchange, see this answer provided at security.stackexchange.com. As an answer to this current question, I'd like to quote a comment posted below the answer in the link: 

I think it's worth mentioning that the reason this is secure is that,
  unlike normal log(x), the modular log(x) is thought to be hard to
  compute.

That ""hard to compute"" part is what is alluded to with the metaphor of paint that is ""hard to separate once it is mixed"".

cat /etc/*release
LSB_VERSION=""core-2.0-noarch:core-3.0-noarch:core-2.0-ia32:core-3.0-ia32""
  SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 (i586)
  VERSION = 10

The Java Version we are using (32 bit and 64 bit the same releases)

Java Version:
jdk1.8.0_151

The strange thing is, after downgrading to java 1.7 it works without any problems. 
Also the same application runs on a different 64 bit system (with java 1.8) - so we assume that this might be an issue with os architecture (32 bit), the age of the os (in this case from 2006) and java.
We found some bug reports regarding the open JDK that the maximum length was 2048 - but we are using the regular JDK from oracle in the moment.
Thanks for your help,

"51462932","Java / Erlang: Diffie Hellman Key Exchange not Working","I wanted to implement my own encryption for my application. I did a major overhaul of this post. I really didn't have much time until today to address it. Hopefully this being the more useful than my original. Spent a ridiculous amount of time on this issue. Hopefully can save others that time.
I encountered several issues while doing this. I did not realize what was happening until the very end. I was getting different shared secrets and later some exceptions.
This is what I tried:

Used the built in facilities provided by both languages. Couldn't figure out how to get the raw public key into a form Java could use.
Scratched that and went with the simple formulas to calculate the public and private keys for each party. (This statistically could've worked ~25% of the time... luckily for me it didn't.) 
Dived into ASN.1 documentation from the ITU and sent the Erlang public key encoded in a similar manner to Java's keys. Determined this by saving the Java key to a file and using a hex editor. I didn't go back and test at great length. It did get rid of java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException: Inappropriate key specification. Think statistics didn't work in my favor here either. The secrets still did not match.
Sent all numbers from Java to the Erlang-side to compute keys, shared secret using Java numbers... Same numbers. There is hope!!!
Started carefully examining the data they were communicating. This was a bit time consuming as Erlang has the data organized in unsigned bytes. The Eclipse IDE (maybe there's a setting somewhere to change) uses signed bytes in byte arrays and a signed integer array within BigInteger.

This is where I began to see things. This all was manually entered over many iterations to make sure I found the correct pattern of events. In Erlang I see my public key beginning with <<215, 101, 208, 153,. The first element of the BigInteger on the Java-side is 681193318. The buffer the byte data was read into reads: [-41, 101, -48, -103. (Same as Erlang's). However taking the time convert the 1st four elements of the binary string to an integer...
<<I:32/signed-integer>> = <<215,101,208,153>>.
That yields -681193319 versus the big integer's 681193318
The code I was using was some what simple:

    io:format(""Got connection: ~p~n"", [Conn]),
    Handler = spawn(fun () -> handle(Conn) end),
    gen_tcp:controlling_process(Conn, Handler),

            e.printStackTrace();
        }       
    }
}

What was wrong?
","The issue is reading but not understanding the documentation. I spend a lot of time in reference pages because I don't code very often. I did not think much of this particular detail in the documentation for BigInteger:  

All operations behave as if Bigintegers were represented in
  two's-complement notation...

There are two spots in my original code where this presents an issue:
       Ys = new BigInteger(buf2);          
       Sc = Ys.modPow(Xc, DiffieHellman.Group2.P);

The issue with the first line is that if bit 8 is set in the first byte the entire buf2 array needs to be prepended with a 0x00 byte. There is an issue with the second line as well... it does not become evident until the following line is executed: aeskey = hash.digest(Sc.toByteArray());
The issue here is if bit 8 is set in the first byte of the result... 0x00 is prepended to it. This is forwarded to the digest() function but needs to be omitted.
My code changed to what is below and works: :)
    len = in.read(buffer);
    buf2 = new byte[len+1];
    System.arraycopy(buffer, 0, buf2, 1, len);
    buf2[0] = 0;

    if(buf2[1] < 0)
        Ys = new BigInteger(buf2);
    else
        Ys = new BigInteger(Arrays.copyOfRange(buf2, 1, buf2.length));

    Sc = Ys.modPow(Xc, DiffieHellman.Group2.P);
    buffer = Sc.toByteArray();
    if(buffer[0] == 0)
        aeskey = hash.digest(Arrays.copyOfRange(buffer, 1, buffer.length));
    else
        aeskey = hash.digest(buffer);

These two lines were left as is:
    Xc = new BigInteger(keybuffer);
    Yc = new BigInteger(""2"").modPow(Xc, DiffieHellman.Group2.P);

This is because the private key can be ""any random number."" The 0x00 byte is prepended if necessary to the public key of the client in the second line. However Erlang interprets integers as big-endian and any leading 0x00 bytes end up being irrelevant as it does not affect the numerical value and hence the result when conducting a crypto:mod_pow().
Comments on how to improve code very welcome.

Note that using the same key (pair) two different purposes is considered bad key management by most. It may allow for attacks that uses vulnerabilities in either or a combination in both the algorithms and the protocol. Using the same key type / strength is of course fine.

https://pastebin.com/2F2sQ2Pe (https://github.com/ASKGLab/DHApplet) ( its bigger file so I uplouded to pastebin not sure if its a problem )
And then I create 2 instance of it and call it like this ( show only one instance ):
DiffieHellman dh = new DiffieHellman();
dh.init();
dh.getY(hostY, (short)0);
dh.setY(cardY, (short) 0, (short) cardY.length, (short) 0); 
AESKey encKey = (AESKey) KeyBuilder.buildKey(KeyBuilder.TYPE_AES_TRANSIENT_RESET, KeyBuilder.LENGTH_AES_128, false);
dh.doFinal(encKey);

hostY and cardY are public values. I tried it on desktop App so I have guarance that there is no probleme with Communication with JavaCard. So my question is that after all of this SharedSecret differ and I have no idea why because I execute Y = G^bobPrivKey mod P via RSA's decrypt to get Y's transfer them and then execute S = Y^a mod p via RSA's decrypt. 
Thank's for any answer in advance.
","(Assuming you are using jCardSim for Java Card API emulation on desktop)
There is a problem with jCardSim that it always uses CRT private keys (as used RSAKeyPairGenerator always generates CRT private keys which always implement RSAPrivateCrtKeyParameters -- see here and here).
So every jCardSim RSA private key (even that generated with ALG_RSA) is implemented by RSAPrivateCrtKeyImpl (you can check yourself with .getClass().getCanonicalName()).
The real problem is that RSAPrivateCrtKeyImpl class ignores the value of modulus when doing the actual crypto:
AssymetricCipherImpl.init():
// ...some code above skipped...
KeyWithParameters key = (KeyWithParameters) theKey;
engine.init(theMode == MODE_ENCRYPT, key.getParameters());
// ...some code below skipped...

RSAPrivateCrtKeyImpl.getParameters() -- there is no use of modulus field:
public CipherParameters getParameters() {
    if (!isInitialized()) {
        CryptoException.throwIt(CryptoException.UNINITIALIZED_KEY);
    }
    // modulus = p * q;
    return new RSAPrivateCrtKeyParameters(p.getBigInteger().multiply(q.getBigInteger()), null,
            null, p.getBigInteger(), q.getBigInteger(),
            dp1.getBigInteger(), dq1.getBigInteger(), pq.getBigInteger());
}

So the setModulus() call used to set the desired DH Group prime has no effect and the original (generated) modulus is used.
Good luck!

My questions: (1) Is a combination of session type ""DH-SHA1"" and association type ""HMAC-SHA256"" valid?  (2) How about the reverse, i.e. ""DH-SHA256"" and ""HMAC-SHA1""?
I don't think these mixed combinations are explicitly forbidden by the spec, but section 8.2.3 describes the process of encrypting the MAC key for transport as follows:
enc_mac_key

     Value: base64(H(btwoc(g ^ (xa * xb) mod p)) XOR MAC key)

     Description: The MAC key (shared secret), encrypted with the
     secret Diffie-Hellman value.  H is either ""SHA1"" or ""SHA256""
     depending on the session type.

Does this imply that the MAC key length must be 20 bytes for session type DH-SHA1 and 32 byte for session type DH-SHA256?  Section 6.2 of the spec states
OpenID Authentication supports two signature algorithms:
o  HMAC-SHA1 - 160 bit key length ([RFC2104] and [RFC3174])
o  HMAC-SHA256 - 256 bit key length ([RFC2104] and [FIPS180-2]

Does this then imply that DH-SHA1 always must be paired with HMAC-SHA1 and the same for the ...256 versions?
Another data point: the OpenId provider at https://me.yahoo.com/ seems to accept association requests with session type DH-SHA1 and association type HMAC-SHA256, returning a 20 byte MAC key.

I thought at first that maybe the private cert had to come from the cert store, so I imported it and then pulled it back out, but I get the same error, which is another reason I believe I'm not doing something quite right.
EDIT:
I have another class generating RSA x509's using the same code for putting the private key into the certificate.  It allows me to export the RSA private key.  
The variable _keyStrength is 384 and my signature factory is using ""SHA256withECDSA"".  I have also tried using ""SHA384withECDSA"" but I get the same error.
","OK. It's a blind shot but after looking at your code I noticed two things:

When you create PFX you set null password. But when you load the PFX into X509Certificate2 class you are using wrong constructor. You should use one with a password parameter and give a null into it
When you load PFX into X509Certificate2 class you do not specify, if the private key should be exportable. I think that this is the reason why privateKey.ExportParameters(true) gives you an exception. You should use this constructor and specify null as password


Made it working
I thought it was a bug. It's possible that it is. We clearly stated in X509Constructor that the private key should be exportable. I used X509KeyStorageFlags.EphemeralKeySet | X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable flags too. But when I looked at the CngKey it had ExportPolicy set to AllowExport but not AllowPlaintextExport. 
It was exportable in some way. privateKey.Key.Export(CngKeyBlobFormat.OpaqueTransportBlob) worked. But privateKey.ExportParameters(true) did not.
I've searched for a solution how to change ExportPolicy of CngKey. I found this SO question that helped me to change it. After that the ExportParameters worked.

The 3 elemenet sequence contains the prime (p) as the first element of the structure and the generator (g) as the second element. IN JDK each PublicKey types (EC/DH/RSA etc..,) contains corresponding getEncoded() implementation which creates an ASN.1 encoded DER string. Here's such an implementation from JDK for the DHPublicKey. There'll be a similar implementation for the DHPrivateKey.
In your case, the prime value in is 1024 bit and is what you're looking for and the public key value you're interested in is the 1024 bit BIT STRING value.
The sample public key you provided is 256 character hex encoded i.e. 128 byte array i.e. 1024 bit value. This is the first value of the 3 element sequence in the encoded public key structure.

"34994926","Are hashes and MACs vulnerable to bit-flipping attacks?","Suppose there is an encrypted communication between A and B, through an unsecure medium, such that A and B shared a secret key with DH protocol.
If A sends an encrypted message and the hash/MAC/HMAC of this message to B, wouldn't it be easy for an eavesdropper to just intercept the hash/MAC/HMAC, change some bits in it, and send it to B?
B wouldn't be able to check the integrity of all messages sent by A and thus will destroy them everytime he gets a message from A, right?
B will then become non available ???
Thank you
","The process you describe is just a very specific form of corrupting the data. If an attacker can corrupt the data, then of course the attacker can prevent A from speaking to B. The attacker could just drop the packets on the ground. That would also prevent A from speaking to B.
Any data corruption, not just modifying the HMAC, will cause this same situation. If I modify the authenticated stream, then the (unmodified) HMAC won't match and it will be discarded.
The point of an HMAC is to ensure integrity. It has nothing to do with availability. Any Man-in-the-Middle can always trivially destroy availability in any system as long as the connection goes through them. (If they can't, they're not a MitM.)

"56062594","OpenSSL ECDH setting peer's public key in C","I'm trying to integrate ECDH using OpenSSL in my C-SDK (which we will refer to as client) which is running on Ubuntu and needed some help regarding how to set the peer's (server) public key on the client side and eventually generating the shared secret.
Some details:

I am successfully generating a public key and can also generate a shared secret on the server side which has an embedded microcontroller using the mbedTLS library.
The public key I receive from the server is in the form of a uint8_t array of size 32 bytes.
I now want to use OpenSSL's ECDH to generate the public key for server and the shared secret on the client side.

I found a sample code on the OpenSSL wiki website which is as below:
#include <openssl/evp.h>
#include <openssl/ec.h>


unsigned char *ecdh(size_t *secret_len)
{
    EVP_PKEY_CTX *pctx, *kctx;
    EVP_PKEY_CTX *ctx;
    unsigned char *secret;
    EVP_PKEY *pkey = NULL, *peerkey, *params = NULL;
    /* NB: assumes pkey, peerkey have been already set up */

    /* Create the context for parameter generation */
    if(NULL == (pctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_id(EVP_PKEY_EC, NULL))) handleErrors();

    /* Initialise the parameter generation */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_paramgen_init(pctx)) handleErrors();

    /* We're going to use the ANSI X9.62 Prime 256v1 curve */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_ec_paramgen_curve_nid(pctx, NID_X9_62_prime256v1)) handleErrors();

    /* Create the parameter object params */
    if (!EVP_PKEY_paramgen(pctx, &params)) handleErrors();

    /* Create the context for the key generation */
    if(NULL == (kctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new(params, NULL))) handleErrors();

    /* Generate the key */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_keygen_init(kctx)) handleErrors();
    if (1 != EVP_PKEY_keygen(kctx, &pkey)) handleErrors();

    /* Get the peer's public key, and provide the peer with our public key -
     * how this is done will be specific to your circumstances */
    peerkey = get_peerkey(pkey);

    /* Create the context for the shared secret derivation */
    if(NULL == (ctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new(pkey, NULL))) handleErrors();

    /* Initialise */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_derive_init(ctx)) handleErrors();

    /* Provide the peer public key */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_derive_set_peer(ctx, peerkey)) handleErrors();

    /* Determine buffer length for shared secret */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_derive(ctx, NULL, secret_len)) handleErrors();

    /* Create the buffer */
    if(NULL == (secret = OPENSSL_malloc(*secret_len))) handleErrors();

    /* Derive the shared secret */
    if(1 != (EVP_PKEY_derive(ctx, secret, secret_len))) handleErrors();

    EVP_PKEY_CTX_free(ctx);
    EVP_PKEY_free(peerkey);
    EVP_PKEY_free(pkey);
    EVP_PKEY_CTX_free(kctx);
    EVP_PKEY_free(params);
    EVP_PKEY_CTX_free(pctx);

    /* Never use a derived secret directly. Typically it is passed
     * through some hash function to produce a key */
    return secret;
}

The example has a peerkey = get_peerkey(pkey); line where it sets the peerkey and basically leaves it on the user to implement this function. I would imagine it would be straightforward if I was using OpenSSL on the server side as well.
My question:
Referring to the above code,and keeping in mind that I'm receiving the server's public key as a uint8_t array, how do I set the EVP_PKEY *peerkey context so that it contains the server's public key?
If there's another straight-forward crypto library in C that I can use on Ubuntu then please do suggest!
Really appreciate any help.
Thank you!

Thanks in advance. 
Update 1:
Thanks to @RbMm I was able to set the prime. The problem was with DHKEYSize. However i am getting an error in while setting KP_X. updated the code above to reflect the new code. 
Here i converted the string to hex bytes array.
","size of prime KP_P (and KP_G) and DH key size hard connected. must be cbKey == 8*cbP. look for example Diffie-Hellman Client Code for Creating the Master Key:
as key size if used cbP * 8 where cbP size of prime P. in your link also P.cbData = DHKEYSIZE/8;
also in code instead hard-code size of P (and G) you can get it in runtime:
ULONG dwDataLen;
CryptGetKeyParam(hPrivateKey1, KP_P, 0, &(dwDataLen = 0), 0);
CryptGetKeyParam(hPrivateKey1, KP_G, 0, &(dwDataLen = 0), 0);

and you can sure that dwDataLen == DHKEYSIZE / 8 where DHKEYSIZE is key size.
because you use  512 as key size, the length of data for P and G must be 512/8=64. but you use 256 (for P) and 1 (for G). as result and error.

I am trying to generate a public and private keypair using elliptic curve diffie-hellman, I successfully generate a private key that is smaller than the order of the curve but when I calculate the public key by multiplying the base point by the private key I calculate a point that is not on the curve.
The code I am using to generate the keys looks like this:
Public Shared Function generate_Keys(ByVal Param As Domain_Parameters) As Keys
        Dim __PrivateKey As BigInteger
        Dim __PublicKey As ECPoint
        Dim d As BigInteger
        Dim rng As New RNGCryptoServiceProvider
        Dim bytes(Param.n.ToByteArray.Length) As Byte
        Do
            rng.GetBytes(bytes)
            d = New BigInteger(bytes)
            If d.Sign = -1 Then
                d = d * -1
            End If

I have a feeling that it is possibly the way I am generating a private key or that I am using the wrong operation when calculating G.d .
Any help would really be appreciated thanks.
===EDIT===
After spending some time check values I have found the problem to be caused by the scalar_mult function not returning the right value. Is this function written correctly because i am unsure I have tested it with values from a site and it has been adapted from the pseudocode on wikipedia. Is that the correct method for adding a point to itself x number of time?

","I tested various numbers into that function and it worked great. I then created a duplicate function that used the following code based on Uwe Plonus' answer:

I tested your numbers into it and got 43, just like that function; so that function seems to be working perfectly. The person that posted 29,83,53 numbers as resulting in 50 appears to be wrong. The correct answer for 29,83,53 is 43.

            if ((y & oneShift63) != 0)
                result = result * x % N;
        }
        return result;
    }

    public static long XpowYmodN(long x, long y, long N) {
        return BigInteger.valueOf(x).modPow(BigInteger.valueOf(y), BigInteger.valueOf(N)).longValue();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println(""BEGIN main"");


        System.out.println(Main.XpowYmodN_(29,83,53));
        System.out.println(Main.XpowYmodN(29,83,53));
    }
}

which gave the output of:

BEGIN main

"55451757","Efficient way to do payload signing in HTML5 SPA","I'm looking to implement some efficient (i.e. with good performance) logic that does payload signing in our web application. The goal is for the HTML5 client to have a guarantee that the contents of a received payload are indeed those that were generated by our backend.
We don't want to do payload hash generation with shared salt because the user can easily open the HTML5 source and find the salt phrase.
We have implemented RSA signing for now where our backend adds a payload signature using its Private Key and our HTML5 client validates it using its baked in Public Key. However the signature generation process takes 250ms (for a relatively small payload) and due to the nature of the signed request this amount of time is unacceptable.
The only other idea is to generate a shared secret at runtime every time a client initializes its session with the backend. The secret however can't be sent in plaintext form so it seems we're going to have to implement a Diffie-Hellman exchange mechanism, something we'd like to avoid if possible or automate with existing libraries.
Remember that the secrecy and encryption need to be done at the Application layer, due to the nature of how we sell our product. We're not looking to encrypt our traffic, this is something that our customers might or might not implement (since it's an intranet application). However, we have to avoid exposing stuff that are related to our licensing checking mechanisms etc to them. The backend is not cloud based and is not controlled by us, but installed on the customers' machines, on premises.
Frontend is Javascript and backend is Java.
","Note that Diffie-Hellman exchange mechanism is not protected against MITM attack, therefore not encrypting traffic means that you need to authenticate the DH data coming from the server. This is why a web server using a DH-based cipher suite signs the DH elements sent over the network with the private key of its server certificate, for the client to check that those elements are really from the server that he wants to connect to. Those elements are public but need to be signed.
What you call ""payload hash generation with shared salt"" is a keyed-hash message authentication code, so it is based on a shared secret, as you noticed, and since you do not want to use this mechanism, it means that you do not trust the client. Therefore, you have to use asymetric cryptography to sign your payload.
Signing a server payload with an asymetric algorithm means that you first need to let the server share a public key with the client. Since you do not encrypt data between the client and the server, you need to deploy the server public key inside the client source code.
You talk about the signature generation process, but the signature check process on the client side is also very important in your case, because the total time the user has to wait for the result is the addition of the time to sign and the time to check the signature (moreover, the signature can often be anticipated on the server, if the data to sign is not dynamically generated, but the verification can never be anticipated). So you need a rapid way of checking a signature on the client side. First, sign a hash, not the whole payload. Then choose the fastest asymetric signature algorithm that is available in your development environment, on the client side. Note that checking an RSA signature is faster that checking a DSA or ECDSA one, for respective keys length corresponding to the same security level. So you should stay with RSA.
All of this until this line may not help you so much! Now there is a way to increase the performances using RSA to sign and verify signatures, and this way is rather the same that SSL/TLS implements to increase browser performances when downloading multiple pages or other objects from the same server: use a session cache. You share a common secret for a specific session with one specific user. Never use this common secret for other sessions. When the user is connecting for the first time, use RSA only once, to exchange an ephemeral shared secret or exchange DH material to create this shared secret. Then, each time the server needs to sign an object, it creates a keyed-hash message authentication code with this specific secret. Therefore, if the user finds the secret, for instance using the debug mode of his browser, it's not a problem: this secret is only here to help him know that something that comes from the server has not been altered. So the user can not use this secret to alter data exchanges between the server and other users.

","We ended up by using TweetNaCl both on the client and on the server side. The library provides a every easy and fast way to do DH-like shared secret exchange without going through a custom implementation. With an ephemeral shared secret we can easily generate hashes instead of signatures for our payloads dropping from 250ms to 10μs. Also RSA signing the initial DH exchange is important and the only place we use RSA.

Similar to how regular public key transactions work, but server agnostic.
A use case:
Everything on my Facebook profile is encrypted, and no body would be able to view that information (not even facebook). The users that I give the key would be able to decrypt that information.
This would allow complete control of data stored online.
The same idea can be applied for pictures uploaded to the internet.
One issue that I see is to have a practical mechanism to manage keys and a secure way to distribute keys to other users.
Has anyone done something like this before?
","In case of Facebook I can imagine encrypting the data with OpenPGP keys into armored (text) format. Then you can place encrypted block to facebook or anywhere else. Other users would take the block, decrypt it on the client side and see it.
The same applies with other social networks and places where you can store some text block. 
You can easily do encryption in some client application and even in Javascript (if you manage to make JavaScript load local user's keys somehow).

"55677357","Decode Diffie Hellman p,g,A given","Decode Text encrypted with DH coded with Caesar Cipher.
We have to decode following text: FKXSQBQZACKFAHRSCAN DFYZSYQBSFN.
I have tried to ""guess"" the private Key for Alice with a for loop and think I got the right one but now I'm stuck.
p,g and A are given.
p = 23
g = 15
A = 6 #exchangeKey Alice

I think the problem could be that I don't know how the text is coded. Did the teacher use an array like?:
alphabet = [""A"",""B"",""C"",""D"",""E"",""F"",""G"",""H"",""I"",""J"",""K"",""L"",""M"",""N"",""O"",""P"",""Q"",""R"",""S"",""T"",""U"",""V"",""W"",""X"",""Y"",""Z""]

Or did she use the ASCII table.
But is it even possible to decode this text without any information about ""Bob"".
My research brought only information about MITM attacks where the hacker got p,g,A and B
Get Alicekey
for getkeyalice in range(p):
    if (g**getkeyalice)%p == A:
        keyalice = getkeyalice

Decode
for char in message:
    #index=(alphabet.index(char)-j)
    #decryptedlst.append(alphabet[index])
    decryptedlst.append(chr(ord(char)-i))
    decrypted = ''.join(decryptedlst)
    print(""decrypted message:\t""+str(decrypted))

I'm looking for the decryption key. I don't expect this should be a very high number. But even bruteforcing all numbers from 1-4096 didn't help. So back to the top.... perhaps the kind of decryption I'm using is different to the encryption of the teacher.
","This problem can not be resolved due to a lack of input.
Even if you can easily brute-force Alice's private key, that is 14 (15¹⁴[23]≡6[23]), you have not any information about Bob's choice of key values, so you have no information that could help you find the DH shared secret between Alice and Bob. This is because the shared secret depends both on informations chosen from Alice and on informations chosen by Bob. Therefore, you can not cryptanalyze this problem.

There are many questions on here about setting up pure-JS diffie hellman in place of SSL. All of them are roundly refuted, and I think I understand why (although I completely disagree that there's no value in DH-keyed symmetric encryption for the millions of sites which are not going to be implementing full SSL anytime soon either way).
Anyway, question is this: it seems as though the only preventative reason JS DH wouldn't work is that you lose authentication so you're still subject to man-in-the-middle. All the myriad other issues flow from attempts to resolve this one. 
But what if you used a blockchain as a certificate authority? The process would then be 

Form DH key
encrypt any handshake string with known public key from blockchain
encrypt this verify string with DH key
if handshake string received back, authentication verifies and DH is as secure as SSL DH

Edit: didn't mean to imply DH was symmetric, adjusted for clarity

My problem is client disconnected() and KeyAgreement initialized by singleton object and don't reinitialized second time.
Sometimes I need to do this subject.
Please guide me to fix this problem.
","The IllegalStateException (Phase already executed) seems to be especially caused by the ECDH-implementation of the SunEC-provider. The exception doesn't occur if an (additional) init is executed immediately before the doPhase. However, this init-call shouldn't be necessary, since after the doPhase-call generateSecret is executed, which should reset the KeyAgreement-instance to the state after the init-call, at least according to the generateSecret-documentation: 

This method resets this KeyAgreement object to the state that it was in after the most recent call to one of the init methods...

Possibly it's a bug in the SunEC-provider. If DH is used instead of ECDH (and the SunJCE-provider instead of the SunEC-provider) the behavior is as expected, i.e. repeated doPhase-calls are possible (without additional init-calls). The same applies to ECDH using the BouncyCastle-provider. Therefore, you could take the BouncyCastle-provider instead of the SunEC-provider to run ECDH with your code.
Note: The second parameter (lastPhase) in doPhase should be set to true, otherwise an IllegalStateException (Only two party agreement supported, lastPhase must be true) is generated (at least for ECDH).
EDIT:
The bug is already known and fixed in JDK 12, see JDK-8205476: KeyAgreement#generateSecret is not reset for ECDH based algorithmm.

"56072214","How to deal with 128bit variable in MinGM32 bit compiler for Encryption (Diffie Hellman Algorithm) in Qt","I want to use the below equation in one of the code
A = g^a mod p; //g raise to a modulus p.
(something like 2^5 % 3) = 32%3 = 2
(This equation looks like Diffie Hellman algorithm for security)
Where:

^ is (power)
g is fixed number 0x05
a is 128bit(16bytes) randomly generated number,
p is fixed hex number of 128bit(16bytes). Something like (0x0xD4A283974897234CE908B3478387A3).

I am using:

Qt 4.8.7
Compiler MinGW32 (checked with boost library boost 1.70)

The solutions which I found which didn`t work for me are listed below:

one can use __int128 but to support that one should have used
latest GCC compiler or MinGW64 bit compiler, neither of that I am using now.
I found one latest version of Qt has QSslDiffieHellmanParameters class,
but again not supported in our Qt version.
I found some libraries like  boost/multiprecision/cpp_int.hpp (boost 1.70))
that does have data type such as int128_t and int256_t, but due to 
our compiler isssue or something else, we are not able to store
128bit number, meaning
if I do: 

    int128_t ptval128 = 0xAB1232423243434343BAE3453345E34B;
    cout << ""ptval128 = "" << std::hex << ptval128 << endl;
    //will print only 0xAB12324232434343;//half digits only,


I tried using Bigint which much more useful, but again
5^(128bit number) is way too big, it takes hours to compute things,
(I waited till 1 hour  and 16 mins and kill the application).

    int myGval = 0x05;
    128_bit_data_type myPVal= 0xD4A283974897234CE908B3478387A3; 

    128_bit_data_type 128_bit_variable = 128_bit_random_data;
    myVal = (myGval)^(128_bit_variable) % (myPVal);

","That is not how to do modular exponentiation! The first problem is that 5 ^ 128_bit_variable is huge, so big that it won't fit into memory in any computers available today. To keep the required storage space within bounds, you have to take the remainder % myPVal after every operation.
The second problem is that you can't compute 5 ^ 128_bit_variable simply by multiplying by 5 by itself 128_bit_variable times -- that would take longer than the age of the universe. You need to use an exponentiation ladder, which requires just 128 squarings and at most 128 multiplications. See this Wikipedia article for the details. In the end, the operation 5 ^ 128_bit_number should take a fraction of a second.

DH_generate_key() expects dh to contain the shared parameters dh->p and dh->g. It generates a random private DH value unless dh->priv_key is already set, and computes the corresponding public value dh->pub_key, which can then be published.

So the public ""key"" part of the Diffie Hellman exchange is in ""privkey->pub_key"" and you publish that along with your shared parameters ""privkey->p"" and ""privkey->g"" to the other side.

On the ARM, I use mbed TLS. On the PC side I want to us C# and the ECDiffieHellman(Cng) class.
I can do the ECDH on ARM vs ARM, but I do have trouble when I try to replace one side with the PC.

Problem was the key exchange.
I found out, that the key is exported by mbed TLS as <LEN><0x04><X><Y>.

Thus, In C# I am importing the public key using
private static EC
DiffieHellmanPublicKey ToPublicKey(byte[] publicKey)
{
    var keyLength = 32;

    if (publicKey[0] != (2 + 2 * keyLength) - 1)

    if (publicKey[1] != 0x04)
        throw new ArgumentException(""Invalid key format"", nameof(publicKey));

    {
        Curve = ECCurve.NamedCurves.brainpoolP256r1,
        Q = new ECPoint()
        {
            X = publicKey.Skip(2).Take(keyLength).ToArray(),
            Y = publicKey.Skip(2 + keyLength).Take(keyLength).ToArray()

    };

    using (var tmp = ECDiffieHellman.Create(parameters))
    {
        return tmp.PublicKey;
    }

To generate the key I tried

var ecdh = new ECDiffieHellmanCng(ECCurve.NamedCurves.brainpoolP256r1);
ecdh.KeyDerivationFunction = ECDiffieHellmanKeyDerivationFunction.Tls;
ecdh.Seed = new byte[32];
ecdh.Label = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(""ECDiffieHellman"");

new RNGCryptoServiceProvider().GetBytes(ecdh.Seed);

// ...

var sharedSecret = ecdh.DeriveKeyMaterial(peersPublicKey);

My problem is that the generated shared secret is of different length compared to the one generated by mbed TLS and does not match.
Did someone already solve this problem?
Thanks!
EDIT 1:
I forgot to mention, that I use bare ECDH on ARM. So I don't think there is any key derivation function executing. Is it sufficient to hash (SHA256) the result to match the C# side (when configuring SHA256 as KDF there)?
","I solved the problem. In short: just hash the ECDH result.

encrypt a txt file after obtaining a public key shared between a client/server in Java

Let's assume you are working on a learning or toy project, otherwise there's no point of (re)inventing your own secure communication. If you want to take the security seriously, just use TLS/SSL (optionally with 2-way client auth ssl) for online content transmission. 
I really hope for your own sake you are just learning or playing with this.

to encrypt a txt file using the shared key. I do not know how to even start to do that.

For encryption in rest (encrypting the file itself) - assuming from the question that the sender and receiver are having their own keypairs. 
I suggest to create a random data encryption key to encrypt the content. Then you could simply use receiver's public key to encrypt the data encryption key and sign the content's hash using sender's private key. Never use plain (textbook) RSA, use propper padding.
I made a few notes about encryption for myself, you can take some inspiration. 

The shared key that I have is 18.0.

Apprently you are using not long enough or not random enough public keys. Symmetric ciphers require keys of fixed length (e.g. AES requires 128, 192 or 256 bit keys). You could generate longer keys using any key derivation function or hash. If you want to use two-way communication, you need a separate key for each direction.
Regardless that - short key seed (small shared key, short public keys) would be feasible for brute-forcing. There are many ways how you could shoot yourself in your leg when dealing with crypto, so use some industrial standard when possible (e.g. TLS).

const thread = spawn(function(input, done) {

});

But I get the following error:

    at emit (internal/child_process.js:812:12)

Do you know why the received dh object does not contain the method getPrime and via an assumption the getGenerator as well?
","Well its it true that without proviting generator and prime the key generation is slow on the implementation provided in node.js. But what it makes it slow is the creation of the correct prime and generator where the prime will be 2048 bits.
So you can do the following:

Generate the prime and the generator inside the thread
Pass the prime abd generator via done callback to the message event
Re-create a diffie-hellman object there with the generated prime and generator.

These steps will be resulted from this code:
const spawn = require('threads').spawn;

const thread = spawn(function(input, done) {
  const cryptot = require('crypto');
  console.time('dh-thread');
  const dh = cryptot.createDiffieHellman(2048);
  console.timeEnd('dh-thread');
  done({prime: dh.getPrime().toString('hex'), generator: dh.getGenerator().toString('hex')});
});

thread.send({p:null, g:null}).on('message', (response) => {
  const cryptot = require('crypto');
  const dh =  cryptot.createDiffieHellman(response.prime, response.generator);
  // Do whatever you want there
  thread.kill();
}).on('error', (err)=>{
  console.error(err);
}).on('exit', function() {
  console.log('Worker has been terminated.');
});

Also to justify my statement above let me modify the code a bit using timers:
const spawn = require('threads').spawn;

const thread = spawn(function(input, done) {
  const cryptot = require('crypto');
  console.time('dh-thread');
  const dh = cryptot.createDiffieHellman(2048);
  console.timeEnd('dh-thread');
  done({prime: dh.getPrime().toString('hex'), generator: dh.getGenerator().toString('hex')});
});

thread.send({p:null, g:null}).on('message', (response) => {
  console.time('dh');
  const cryptot = require('crypto');
  const dh =  cryptot.createDiffieHellman(response.prime, response.generator);
  console.timeEnd('dh');
  thread.kill();
}).on('error', (err)=>{
  console.error(err);
}).on('exit', function() {
  console.log('Worker has been terminated.');
});

The execution of the code above will result:
dh-thread: 12815.747ms
dh: 6.733ms
Worker has been terminated.

As you can see the diffie hellman generation without prime and generator takes WAY too long instead of provided prime and generator.

From research, i understanding encryption techniques of diffie-hellman key exchange, and 'signatures' using HMAC with secret key (from the diffie-hellman).
Further research lead me to HTTPS to ensure no-eavesdropping.

However i'm now a little confused as to what i would need to do over the HTTPS connection to ensure that the login data is secured between app & server.
1), is HTTPS enough security to pass POST 'username' & 'password' data down the line to the server on its own? or would an additional security such as a hash of the password be needed?
or
2, would i need to implement a full key exchange + request signature (and at some point an Access Token), over a HTTPS connection?
I'm unsure where to draw the line with encrypting.

","Diffie-Hellman is a method for establishing a shared secret between two entities.
So, that's a part of secret key cryptography.
No number of public keys, unless you manage to generate the current shared secret, will get you the information shared between two parties using secret key crypto.  A public key should be matched to, and used with, a private key.  That's public key cryptography.
For part 1, I guess I don't understand what you want to do with the public key other than generate a pseudonym with it, I don't see why not.
Maybe I'm misunderstanding your question but I believe the answer for part 2 is no.

My understanding is that the key file dh.pem includes not only the secret part of the key, but also the non-secret g and p parameters with which it was generated — i.e., dh.pem is a superset of dhparam.pem.
I would like to reconstruct dhparam.pem, given only dh.pem. That is, given a DH key file, dump its parameters in PEM format.
It seems like openssl itself might not support this directly, but maybe there's some not-too-horrible way to extract the info with a shell script or something? The man page for openssl dhparam says:

This program manipulates DH parameters not keys.
  BUGS: There should be a way to generate and manipulate DH keys.

Related: OpenSSL: Display DH Parameters — but in that question they're starting with a certificate, not a private key. (And I don't know the incantation to turn my key into a certificate.)
","PEM files are base64-encoded DER serialised ASN.1 files with a header and footer guard. A ASN.1 parser with the right schema can decode them. It so happens that openssl has this helpfully built in:

"58765697","How many bytes do I need to read from NetworkStream, when message incoming is encrypted with AES?","I am a student and I am not used to c# or ""network programing"". We need to make a client server program, that supports file transfering.
I'm trying to send some information about the file to server, but if server reads more or less bytes, than client sent, program gives exception. I am asking how can the server side in advance know, the byte size of incoming encrypted message.
For example: if encrypted sent messages size is 48 bytes and on the server side I read 1024 (and not the exact same size - in this example 48) bytes from stream, program chrashes... The problem is, that the server doesn't know encrypted message size in advance...
My program is not even near the final product and I have many other issues too(with GUI freezing without MessageBox.Show("""") messages before reading/writing to NetworkStream), but this is my current question. I also don't know how to set the same IV on server and client side in AES ecncryption, without declaring global IV.

I'm reading here that DHKey is supposed to be a shared secret; they speak of it using singular pronouns. This says to me that DHKey is part of the symmetric cryptography that's supposed to encrypt traffic going forward, rather than the asymmetric cryptography that we've been using to pair up until this point. 
If that analysis is correct, then fact that the two keys do not agree is relevant and should be investigated. But if I'm wrong, and these entries refer to trading keys in preparation for asymmetric cryptography, that these two DHKeys differ would not surprise me. Given the name and the context, what would everybody expect?

Based on this link, there is a solution to edit the java.security file to solve this issue.
I would like to test on it, but I am not sure how to verify it. I would like to see the different before my changes and after my changes. 
I found a command from this link, 
openssl s_client -connect www.example.com:443

I run this command and I get some info, but I am not sure how to verify my website is having Logjam issue or not. (SSL/TLS Diffie-Hellman Modulus <= 1024 bits). And how to check If my changes have overcome this.
","I guess you can use Qualys SSL Labs tools, an example can be found At Oracle Blog.
The test for a server can be found on this link and the User Agent Capabilities is very useful.
