","In most software that generates RSA private keys, including openssl's, the private key is represented as a PKCS#1 RSAPrivatekey object or some variant thereof:

A.1.2 RSA private key syntax
An RSA private key should be represented with the ASN.1 type
  RSAPrivateKey:
  RSAPrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE {
      version           Version,
      modulus           INTEGER,  -- n

As you can see, this format has a number of fields including the modulus and public exponent and thus is a strict superset of the information in an RSA public key.

Does RSA private key contain the sum? or the public key? 
","My answer below is a bit lengthy, but hopefully it provides some details that are missing in previous answers. I'll start with some related statements and finally answer the initial question.
To encrypt something using RSA algorithm you need modulus and encryption (public) exponent pair (n, e). That's your public key. To decrypt something using RSA algorithm you need modulus and decryption (private) exponent pair (n, d). That's your private key.
To encrypt something using RSA public key you treat your plaintext as a number and raise it to the power of e modulus n:
ciphertext = ( plaintext^e ) mod n

To decrypt something using RSA private key you treat your ciphertext as a number and raise it to the power of d modulus n:
plaintext = ( ciphertext^d ) mod n

To generate private (d,n) key using openssl you can use the following command:
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 1024

To generate public (e,n) key from the private key using openssl you can use the following command:
openssl rsa -in private.pem -out public.pem -pubout

To dissect the contents of the private.pem private RSA key generated by the openssl command above run the following (output truncated to labels here):
openssl rsa -in private.pem -text -noout | less

modulus         - n
privateExponent - d
publicExponent  - e
prime1          - p
prime2          - q
exponent1       - d mod (p-1)
exponent2       - d mod (q-1)
coefficient     - (q^-1) mod p

Shouldn't private key consist of (n, d) pair only? Why are there 6 extra components? It contains e (public exponent) so that public RSA key can be generated/extracted/derived from the private.pem private RSA key. The rest 5 components are there to speed up the decryption process. It turns out that by pre-computing and storing those 5 values it is possible to speed the RSA decryption by the factor of 4. Decryption will work without those 5 components, but it can be done faster if you have them handy. The speeding up algorithm is based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
Yes, private.pem RSA private key actually contains all of those 8 values; none of them are generated on the fly when you run the previous command. Try running the following commands and compare output:
# Convert the key from PEM to DER (binary) format
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform der -out private.der

# Print private.der private key contents as binary stream
xxd -p private.der

# Now compare the output of the above command with output 
# of the earlier openssl command that outputs private key
# components. If you stare at both outputs long enough
# you should be able to confirm that all components are
# indeed lurking somewhere in the binary stream
openssl rsa -in private.pem -text -noout | less

This structure of the RSA private key is recommended by the PKCS#1 v1.5 as an alternative (second) representation. PKCS#1 v2.0 standard excludes e and d exponents from the alternative representation altogether. PKCS#1 v2.1 and v2.2 propose further changes to the alternative representation, by optionally including more CRT-related components.
To see the contents of the public.pem public RSA key run the following (output truncated to labels here):
openssl rsa -in public.pem -text -pubin -noout

Modulus             - n
Exponent (public)   - e

No surprises here. It's just (n, e) pair, as promised.
Now finally answering the initial question: As was shown above private RSA key generated using openssl contains components of both public and private keys and some more. When you generate/extract/derive public key from the private key, openssl copies two of those components (e,n) into a separate file which becomes your public key.

Does RSA private key contain the sum? or the public key? 
","Firstly a quick recap on RSA key generation.

Randomly pick two random probable primes of the appropriate size (p and q).
Multiply the two primes together to produce the modulus (n).
Pick a public exponent (e). 
Do some math with the primes and the public exponent to produce the private exponent (d).

The public key consists of the modulus and the public exponent.
A minimal private key would consist of the modulus and the private exponent. There is no computationally feasible surefire way to go from a known modulus and private exponent to the corresponding public exponent.
However:

Practical private key formats nearly always store more than n and d. 
e is normally not picked randomly, one of a handful of well-known values is used. If e is one of the well-known values and you know d then it would be easy to figure out e by trial and error. 

So in most practical RSA implementations you can get the public key from the private key. It would be possible to build a RSA based cryptosystem where this was not possible, but it is not the done thing.

i've read that there are a couple of formats🕗:

Key data may be encoded in three general ways:

Binary DER-encoded format. This is sometimes called ASN.1 BER-encoded
PEM or base64 format. This is the same data as the DER-encoded file but it is encoded in base64 with additional header and footer lines
XML format.


If it's ASN.1, the hex certainly doesn't look like it.
What's the format of an RSA public key?

","You can't just change the delimiters from ---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ---- to -----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY----- and expect that it will be sufficient to convert from one format to another (which is what you've done in your example).
This article has a good explanation about both formats.
What you get in an RSA PUBLIC KEY is closer to the content of a PUBLIC KEY, but you need to offset the start of your ASN.1 structure to reflect the fact that PUBLIC KEY also has an indicator saying which type of key it is (see RFC 3447). You can see this using openssl asn1parse and -strparse 19, as described in this answer.
EDIT: Following your edit, your can get the details of your RSA PUBLIC KEY structure using grep -v -- ----- | tr -d '\n' | base64 -d | openssl asn1parse -inform DER:

  265:d=1  hl=2 l=   3 prim: INTEGER           :010001

To decode the SSH key format, you need to use the data format specification in RFC 4251 too, in conjunction with RFC 4253:

   The ""ssh-rsa"" key format has the following specific encoding:

      string    ""ssh-rsa""
      mpint     e
      mpint     n


For example, at the beginning, you get 00 00 00 07 73 73 68 2d 72 73 61. The first four bytes (00 00 00 07) give you the length. The rest is the string itself: 73=s, 68=h, ... -> 73 73 68 2d 72 73 61=ssh-rsa, followed by the exponent of length 1 (00 00 00 01 25) and the modulus of length 256 (00 00 01 00 7f ...).

i've read that there are a couple of formats🕗:

Key data may be encoded in three general ways:

Binary DER-encoded format. This is sometimes called ASN.1 BER-encoded
PEM or base64 format. This is the same data as the DER-encoded file but it is encoded in base64 with additional header and footer lines
XML format.


If it's ASN.1, the hex certainly doesn't look like it.
What's the format of an RSA public key?

","Starting from the decoded base64 data of an OpenSSL rsa-ssh Key, i've been able to guess a format:

00 00 00 07: four byte length prefix (7 bytes)
73 73 68 2d 72 73 61: ""ssh-rsa""
00 00 00 01: four byte length prefix (1 byte)

The closest validation of my theory i can find it from RFC 4253:

The ""ssh-rsa"" key format has the following specific encoding:
  string    ""ssh-rsa""
  mpint     e
  mpint     n

Here the 'e' and 'n' parameters form the signature key blob.

But it doesn't explain the length prefixes.

From RFC3447 - Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.1:

A.1.1 RSA public key syntax
An RSA public key should be represented with the ASN.1 type RSAPublicKey:
  RSAPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
     modulus           INTEGER,  -- n
     publicExponent    INTEGER   -- e
  }

The fields of type RSAPublicKey have the following meanings:

modulus is the RSA modulus n.
publicExponent is the RSA public exponent e.


Using Microsoft's excellent (and the only real) ASN.1 documentation: 
30 82 01 0a       ;SEQUENCE (0x010A bytes: 266 bytes)
|  02 82 01 01    ;INTEGER  (0x0101 bytes: 257 bytes)

|  |  63 
|  02 03          ;INTEGER (3 bytes)

giving the public key modulus and exponent:

modulus = 0xfb1199ff0733f6e805a4fd3b36ca68...837a63
exponent = 65,537

","On the basic question of why openssl is not found:
Short answer:Some installation packages for openssl have a default openssl.cnf pre-included.  Other packages do not.
In the latter case you will include one from the link shown below;
You can enter additional user-specifics --DN name,etc-- as needed.
From https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man5/config.html,I quote directly:
""OPENSSL LIBRARY CONFIGURATION
Applications can automatically configure certain aspects of OpenSSL using the master OpenSSL configuration file, or optionally an alternative configuration file. The openssl utility includes this functionality: any sub command uses the master OpenSSL configuration file unless an option is used in the sub command to use an alternative configuration file.
To enable library configuration the default section needs to contain an appropriate line which points to the main configuration section. The default name is openssl_conf which is used by the openssl utility. Other applications may use an alternative name such as myapplication_conf. All library configuration lines appear in the default section at the start of the configuration file.
The configuration section should consist of a set of name value pairs which contain specific module configuration information. The name represents the name of the configuration module. The meaning of the value is module specific: it may, for example, represent a further configuration section containing configuration module specific information. E.g.:""
So it appears one must self configure openssl.cnf according to your
Distinguished Name (DN), along with other entries specific to your use.
Here is the template file from which you can generate openssl.cnf
with your specific entries.
One Application actually has a demo installation that includes a demo .cnf file.
Additionally, if you need to programmatically access .cnf files, you can
include appropriate headers --openssl/conf.h-- and parse your .cnf files
using 
CONF_modules_load_file(const char *filename, const char *appname,
                            unsigned long flags);

Here are docs for ""CONF_modules_load_file"";

How can we configure secret key
","Looks like the secret key isn't on the other machine, so even with the right passphrase (read from a file) it wouldn't work.
These options should work, to 

Either copy the keyrings (maybe only secret keyring required, but public ring is public anyway) over to the other machine
Or export the secret key & then import it on the other machine

A few useful looking options from man gpg:

--export
  Either export all keys from all keyrings (default keyrings and  those
                registered  via  option --keyring), or if at least one name is given,
                those of the given name. The new keyring is written to STDOUT  or  to
                the  file  given  with  option --output. Use together with --armor to
                mail those keys.
--export-secret-keys
               Same as --export, but exports the secret keys instead.
--import
--fast-import
               Import/merge keys. This adds the given keys to the keyring. The  fast
                version is currently just a synonym.

And maybe

--keyring file
               Add file to the current list of keyrings. If file begins with a tilde
                and a slash, these are replaced by the $HOME directory. If the  file‐
                name  does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the GnuPG home
                directory (""~/.gnupg"" if --homedir or $GNUPGHOME is not used).
Note that this adds a keyring to the current list. If the  intent  is
                to  use  the  specified keyring alone, use --keyring along with --no-default-keyring.
--secret-keyring file
               Same as --keyring but for the secret keyrings.

You can solve this by brute force for relatively small numbers but the overall security of RSA depends on the fact that this problem is intractable in general.

","Here's a relatively simple way to look at it (and one that is doable by hand). If you were to factor the number completely, then the highest factor you would need to consider is sqrt(N):
sqrt(10142789312725007) = 100711415.9999997567

The first prime below this is 100711409, just 6 below the sqrt(N). 
10142789312725007 / 100711409 = 100711423 

therefore these are two factors of N. Your professor made it pretty easy - the trick is to recognize that no one would choose a small p or q so starting your check from the bottom (as in the python script someone posted) is a bad idea. If it's going to be practical by hand, the large p and q must lie near sqrt(N).

","You need to factorize the modulus, that's the first parameter of the public key, 10142789312725007. Brute force will do (check every odd number from 3 to sqrt(n) if it's a factor), although more sophisticated/fast algorithms exist.
Since the number is too big to fit into a conventional integer (even 64-bit), you might want a numeric library that supports arbitrary-lenth integers. For C, there's GMP and MPIR (more Windows-friendly). For PHP, there's Bignum. Python comes with a built-in one - the built-in integer datatype is already arbitrary-length.

","Your teacher gave you: 

Public Key: (10142789312725007, 5)

which means
n = 10142789312725007
e = 5 

where n is the modulus and e is the public exponent.
In addition, you're given

Private Key: (10142789312725007, 8114231289041741)

meaning that
 d = 8114231289041741

where d is the decryption exponent that should remain secret. 
You can ""break"" RSA by knowing how to factor ""n"" into its ""p"" and ""q"" prime factors:
n = p * q

The easiest way is probably to check all odd numbers starting just below the square root of n:
Floor[Sqrt[10142789312725007]] = 100711415

You would get the first factor in 4 tries:
10142789312725007 mod 100711415 = 100711367
10142789312725007 mod 100711413 = 100711373
10142789312725007 mod 100711411 = 100711387
10142789312725007 mod 100711409 = 0 <-- Winner since it evenly divides n

So we have
 p = 100711409

Now,
 q = n / p 
   = 10142789312725007 / 100711409
   = 100711423

Why is this important? It's because d is a special number such that 
d = e^-1 mod phi(n)
  = e^-1 mod (p-1)*(q-1)

We can verify this
d * e = 40571156445208705 = 1 mod 10142789111302176

This is important because if you have a plaintext message m then the ciphertext is
c = m^e mod n

and you decrypt it by
m = c^d = (m^e)^d = (m^(e*d)) = (m^(e*e^-1)) = m^1 (mod n)

For example, I can ""encrypt"" the message 123456789 using your teacher's public key:
m = 123456789

This will give me the following ciphertext:
c = m^e mod n 
  = 123456789^5 mod 10142789312725007
  = 7487844069764171

(Note that ""e"" should be much larger in practice because for small values of ""m"" you don't even exceed n)
Anyways, now we have ""c"" and can reverse it with ""d""
m = c^d mod n
  = 7487844069764171^8114231289041741 mod 10142789312725007
  = 123456789

Obviously, you can't compute ""7487844069764171^8114231289041741"" directly because it has 128,808,202,574,088,302 digits, so you must use the modular exponentiation trick.
In the ""Real World"", n is obviously much larger. If you'd like to see a real example of how HTTPS uses RSA under the covers with a 617-digit n and an e of 65537, see my blog post ""The First Few Milliseconds of an HTTPS Connection.""

","There are various fast algorithms to solve the problem of factoring n given n, e, and d. You can find a good description of one such algorithm in the Handbook of Applied Cryptography, Chapter 8, section 8.2.2. You can find these chapters online for free download here. The algorithm is essentially a careful elaboration of Henno Brandsma's answer to this very question.
UPDATE Sep 25, 2019:
In the comment below, user Imperishable Night suggests an alternative method which should be at least conceptually easier to understand.
He notes that usually e is small. In fact e is almost always 65537. In the case that e is small you can develop a quadratic equation in the unknown prime p and thus easily solve for it using e.g. the quadratic formula. To proceed, lets set x=p and solve for x, just to stick with convention. We know that ed = 1 mod phi(n), or equivalently 
ed - 1 = k * (p-1)*(q-1). Now setting x=p, and therefore n/x=q, multiplying both sides by x and rearranging terms we have
k*x2 + (d*e - k*n - k - 1)*x + k*n = 0.
 Now we have an equation
of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 and we can solve for x using the quadratic formula. So we can try values of k in a small range around e and there should be only one integer solution to the quadratic, the solution for the correct k. 
Notes:

Everything must be an integer, thus the discriminant must be a perfect square or we can discard k and try the next one. Also, the numerator must be divisible by 2*k.
Sometimes the Carmichael lambda function is used in place of the Euler phi function. This complicates things just a little bit because we must now also guess the g = gcd(p-1, q-1). g is always even, is often 2, and is otherwise almost always a small multiple of 2.

UPDATE Sep 26, 2019:
Finding k is actually very easy when e is small. By taking the equation
ed - 1 = k * (p-1)*(q-1) and dividing both sides by n it is fairly easy to see that floor((ed-1)/n) + 1 == k. Now using equations
31 and 32 of M.J. Wiener's ""Cryptanalysis of Short RSA Secret Exponents"" one can directly recover p and q.

","The algorithm to do this is (and this will work for any example, not only this small one that can be factored easily by any computer):
ed - 1 is a multiple of phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1), so is at least a multiple of 4.
ed - 1 can be computed as 40571156445208704 which equals 2^7 * 316962159728193,
and we call s=7 and t = 316962159728193.
(in general: any even number is a power of 2 times an odd number).
Now pick a in [2,n-1) at random, and compute (by successive squaring modulo n) the sequence 
a^t (mod n), a^(2t) (mod n), a^(4t) (mod n).. until at most a^((2^7)*t) (mod n), 
where the last one is guaranteed to be 1, by the construction of e and d.
We now look for the first 1 in that sequence. The one before it will either be +1 or -1
    (a trivial root of 1, mod n) and we redo with a different a, or some number x which does not equal +1 or -1 mod n.
    In the latter case gcd(x-1, n) is a non-trivial divisor of n, and so p or q, and we are done. One can show that a random a will work with probability about 0.5, so we need a few tries, but not very many in general.

","Sorry for the necromancy, but a friend asked me about this, and after pointing him here, I realized that I didn't really like any of the answers.  After factoring the modulus and getting the primes (p and q), you need to find the totient, which is (p-1)*(q-1).
Now, to find the private exponent, you find the inverse of the public exponent mod the totient.
public_exponent * private_exponent = 1 mod totient

And now you have your private key, that easy.  All of this except for the factorization can be done almost instantly for huge integers.
I wrote some code:
// tinyrsa.c
//
// apt-get install libgmp-dev
// yum install gmp-devel
//
// gcc tinyrsa.c -o tinyrsa -lm -lgmp

#include<stdio.h>
#include<gmp.h>

int main()
{
  // declare some multi-precision integers
  mpz_t pub_exp, priv_exp, modulus, totient, fac_p, fac_q, next_prime;

  mpz_init_set_str(pub_exp,""5"",10);
  mpz_init_set_str(modulus,""10142789312725007"",10);

  mpz_init(priv_exp);
  mpz_init(totient);
  mpz_init(fac_p);
  mpz_init(fac_q);

  // now we factor the modulus (the hard part)
  mpz_init(next_prime);
  mpz_sqrt(next_prime,modulus);
  unsigned long removed=0;
  while(!removed)
  {
    mpz_nextprime(next_prime,next_prime);
    removed=mpz_remove(fac_p,modulus,next_prime);
  }

  mpz_remove(fac_q,modulus,fac_p);
  // we now have p and q

  // the totient is (p-1)*(q-1)  
  mpz_t psub, qsub;
  mpz_init(psub);
  mpz_init(qsub);

  mpz_sub_ui(psub,fac_p,1);
  mpz_sub_ui(qsub,fac_q,1);
  mpz_mul(totient,psub,qsub);

  // inverse of the public key, mod the totient..
  mpz_invert(priv_exp,pub_exp,totient);

  gmp_printf(""private exponent:\n%Zd\n"",priv_exp);

}

The factorization algorithm I used is stupid, but concise, so grain of salt there.  In this particular example the code runs almost instantly, but that is largely because the instructor in question provided an example that uses two primes in a row, which isn't really realistic for RSA.
If you wanted to cut out my stupid iterative search, you could put in some real factorization algorithm, and factor keys likely up to around 256 bits in a reasonable amount of time.

Here's a janky little module you could use to encrypt/decrypt strings with RSA keys:
var crypto = require(""crypto"");
var path = require(""path"");
var fs = require(""fs"");

var encryptStringWithRsaPublicKey = function(toEncrypt, relativeOrAbsolutePathToPublicKey) {
    var absolutePath = path.resolve(relativeOrAbsolutePathToPublicKey);
    var publicKey = fs.readFileSync(absolutePath, ""utf8"");
    var buffer = Buffer.from(toEncrypt);
    var encrypted = crypto.publicEncrypt(publicKey, buffer);
    return encrypted.toString(""base64"");
};

var decryptStringWithRsaPrivateKey = function(toDecrypt, relativeOrAbsolutePathtoPrivateKey) {
    var absolutePath = path.resolve(relativeOrAbsolutePathtoPrivateKey);
    var privateKey = fs.readFileSync(absolutePath, ""utf8"");
    var buffer = Buffer.from(toDecrypt, ""base64"");
    var decrypted = crypto.privateDecrypt(privateKey, buffer);
    return decrypted.toString(""utf8"");
};

module.exports = {
    encryptStringWithRsaPublicKey: encryptStringWithRsaPublicKey,
    decryptStringWithRsaPrivateKey: decryptStringWithRsaPrivateKey
}

I would recommend not using synchronous fs methods where possible, and you could use Promises to make this better, but for simple use cases this is the approach that I have seen work and would take

I am loading the pem files fine:

but after hours of scouring google I can't seem to find a way to encrypt data using the public key. In php I simply call openssl_public_encrypt, but I don't see any corresponding function in node or in any modules. 
If anyone has any suggestions, let me know.
","I tested this in Node 10, you can use encrypt/decrypt functions (small changes on Jacob's answer)
const crypto = require('crypto')
const path = require('path')
const fs = require('fs')

function encrypt(toEncrypt, relativeOrAbsolutePathToPublicKey) {
  const absolutePath = path.resolve(relativeOrAbsolutePathToPublicKey)
  const publicKey = fs.readFileSync(absolutePath, 'utf8')
  const buffer = Buffer.from(toEncrypt, 'utf8')
  const encrypted = crypto.publicEncrypt(publicKey, buffer)
  return encrypted.toString('base64')

  const absolutePath = path.resolve(relativeOrAbsolutePathtoPrivateKey)
  const privateKey = fs.readFileSync(absolutePath, 'utf8')
  const buffer = Buffer.from(toDecrypt, 'base64')
  const decrypted = crypto.privateDecrypt(
    {
      key: privateKey.toString(),
      passphrase: '',
    },
    buffer,
  )
  return decrypted.toString('utf8')
}

const enc = encrypt('hello', `public.pem`)
console.log('enc', enc)

const dec = decrypt(enc, `private.pem`)
console.log('dec', dec)


For the keys you can generate them with
const { writeFileSync } = require('fs')
const { generateKeyPairSync } = require('crypto')

function generateKeys() {
  const { privateKey, publicKey } = generateKeyPairSync('rsa', {
    modulusLength: 4096,

","I think the problem is that you should use the same key pair to encrypt and decrypt the cipher. Referring to the JavaDoc:
 genKeyPair() This will generate a new key pair every time it is called.

","In RSA you should use the public key for encryption and the private key for decryption. 
Your sample code uses for encryption and decryption the public key - this can not work.
Hence in the decryption part you should initialize the cipher this way:
cipher1.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, privateKey);

Furthermor your code has a second significant bug:
You are converting a byte array with binary content to a String.
Never ever convert binary data to a String!
Strings are for string characters, not binary data. If you want to pack binary data into a String encode it to printable characters for example using Hex or Base64.
The following example uses the hexadecimal encoder fro org.apache.common.codec package - a third party library with has to be installed.
public byte[] RSAEncrypt(final String plain) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchPaddingException,
        InvalidKeyException, IllegalBlockSizeException, BadPaddingException {
    kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"");
    kpg.initialize(2048);
    kp = kpg.genKeyPair();
    publicKey = kp.getPublic();
    privateKey = kp.getPrivate();

    cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, publicKey);
    encryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(plain.getBytes());
    System.out.println(""EEncrypted?????"" + new String(org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Hex.encodeHex(encryptedBytes)));
    return encryptedBytes;
}

","id_rsa.pub and id_dsa.pub are the public keys for id_rsa and id_dsa. 
If you are asking in relation to SSH, id_rsa is an RSA key and can be used with the SSH protocol 1 or 2, whereas id_dsa is a DSA key and can only be used with SSH protocol 2.  Both are very secure, but DSA does seem to be the standard these days (assuming all your clients/servers support SSH 2).
Update: Since this was written DSA has been shown to be insecure. More information available in the answer below.

"2821736","What's the difference between id_rsa.pub and id_dsa.pub?","Is one more secure than the other?
","SSH uses public/private key pairs, so
id_rsa is your RSA private key (based on prime numbers), which is more secure than your id_dsa DSA private key (based on exponents).  Keep your private keys safe and share your id_rsa.pub and id_dsa.pub public keys broadly.
DSA is insecure
DSA has a guessable parameter if your computer's random number generator is sub par, which will reveal your secret key.  ECDSA (DSA's elliptical curve upgrade) is similarly vulnerable.  Even with good random numbers, DSA has other strength concerns (these are also found in Diffie-Hellman).
OpenSSH creates insecure 1024 bit keys(workaround) and now disables DSA by default.
Use Ed25519 when possible
Elliptic curve cryptography offers increased complexity with smaller key sizes.  Ed25519 (based on the complexity of plane-modeled elliptical curves) is the preferred implementation due to its assumed lack of meddling (leaked documents show that the US NSA weakens crypto standards).
Unfortunately, Ed25519 is still rather new, requiring OpenSSH 6.5 or GnuPG 2.1 (see the full list).
Use RSA with 4096 bits when Ed25519 is unavailable
RSA key sizes of 4096 bits should have comparable complexity to Ed25519.
Ed25519 is still preferred to RSA due to a worry that RSA may be vulnerable to the same strength concerns as DSA, though applying that exploit to RSA is expected to be considerably harder.

I understand that a sender may add a digital signature to a document using his/her private key to essentially obtain a hash of the document, but what I do not understand is how the public key can be used to verify that signature. 
My understanding was that public keys encrypt, private keys decrypt... can anyone help me understand? 
","Your understanding of ""public keys encrypt, private keys decrypt"" is correct...  for data/message ENCRYPTION.  For digital signatures, it is the reverse.  With a digital signature, you are trying to prove that the document signed by you came from you.  To do that, you need to use something that only YOU have:  your private key.
A digital signature in its simplest description is a hash (SHA1, MD5, etc.) of the data (file, message, etc.) that is subsequently encrypted with the signer's private key.  Since that is something only the signer has (or should have) that is where the trust comes from.  EVERYONE has (or should have) access to the signer's public key.   
So, to validate a digital signature, the recipient 

Calculates a hash of the same data (file, message, etc.),
Decrypts the digital signature using the sender's PUBLIC key, and 
Compares the 2 hash values.    

If they match, the signature is considered valid.  If they don't match, it either means that a different key was used to sign it, or that the data has been altered (either intentionally or unintentionally).
Hope that helps!

My understanding was that public keys encrypt, private keys decrypt... can anyone help me understand? 
","Thought I'd provide a supplemental explanation for anyone looking for something more intuitively revealing.
A big part of this confusion arises from naming 'public keys' and 'private keys' as such because how these things actually work is directly at odds with how a 'key' is understood to be.
Take encryption for example. It could be thought of as working like so:

The parties that want to be able to read the secret messages each keep a key
hidden (i.e. a private key)
The parties that want to be able to send secret messages all have the ability to obtain an unlocked locked (i.e. a public lock)
Then sending a secret message is as easy as locking it with an unlocked lock, but unlocking it afterwards can only be done with one of the hidden keys.

This allows secret messages to be sent between parties, but from an intuitive standpoint here, 'public lock' is a more suitable name than 'public key'.
However, for sending digital signatures the roles are somewhat reversed:

The party that wants to sign messages is the only one with access to the unlocked locks (i.e. a private lock)
The parties that want to verify the signature all have the ability to obtain a key (i.e. a public key)
Then what the signer does is create two identical messages: the one that anyone can read and one to accompany it, but which they lock with one of their private locks.
Then when the receiver gets the message, they can read it, and then use the public key to unlock the locked message and compare the two messages. If the messages are the same, then they know that:

The unlocked message wasn't tampered with during travel and,
The message must have been from the person who has the matching lock to their public key.

And finally, this entire system only works if anyone who wants to validate a signer's signature has an authoritative place to go to to get the matching key to the signer's locks. Otherwise, anyone can say ""Hey, here's the key to so-and-so's private lock"", send you a message pretending to be them but lock it with their private lock, you perform all the above steps and believe the message must actually be from the person you thought, but you're fooled because you were mislead as to the true owner of a public key.

So long as there's a trust-worthy source for retrieving a signer's public key, you'll know who the rightful owner of a public key is, and will be able to validate their signature.

"18257185","How does a public key verify a signature?","I am trying to get a better grapple on how public/private keys work. I understand that a sender may add a digital signature to a document using his/her private key to essentially obtain a hash of the document, but what I do not understand is how the public key can be used to verify that signature. 
My understanding was that public keys encrypt, private keys decrypt... can anyone help me understand? 
","The public key encrypts and only the private key can decrypt it, and the reverse is true. They both encrypt to different hashes but each key can decrypt the other's encryption. 
There are a few different ways to verify that a message came from some expected sender. For example:
The sender sends:

The message
The hash of the message encrypted with their private key

The receiver:

Decrypts the signature (2) with the public key to obtain a message, supposedly the same message as (1) but we don't know yet. We now have two messages that we need to verify are identical. So to do this, we will encrypt them both with our public key and compare the two hashes. So we will ....
Encrypt the original message (1) with the public key to obtain a hash
Encrypt the decrypted message (3) to get a second hash and compare to (4) to verify that they are identical. 

If they aren't identical it means either the message was tampered with or it was signed with some other key and not the one we thought...
Another example would be for the sender to use a common hash that the receiver might know to use as well. For example:
The sender sends:

A message 
Takes a known hash of the message, then encrypts the hash with the private key

The receiver:

Decrypts (2) and gets a hash value
Hashes the message (1) with the same hash used by the sender
Compares the two hashes to make sure they match

This again ensures the message wasn't tampered with and it is from the expected sender.

I have heard that it can happen during the key agreement communication. But in the presence of CA (Certificate Authority) the receiver can authenticate the sender as he received the sender's public key. Therefore, how is a man in the middle attack possible?
","I think you're confusing the basic Diffe-Hellman, which is a key exchange protocol, with the 'authenticated version' which uses a certificate authority (CA).
Nice explanation of how the basic Diffe-Hellman is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle from RSA Labs.

""The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle
  attack. In this attack, an opponent Carol intercepts Alice's public
  value and sends her own public value to Bob. When Bob transmits his
  public value, Carol substitutes it with her own and sends it to Alice.
  Carol and Alice thus agree on one shared key and Carol and Bob agree
  on another shared key. After this exchange, Carol simply decrypts any
  messages sent out by Alice or Bob, and then reads and possibly
  modifies them before re-encrypting with the appropriate key and
  transmitting them to the other party. This vulnerability is present
  because Diffie-Hellman key exchange does not authenticate the
  participants. Possible solutions include the use of digital signatures
  and other protocol variants.""

and it follows with the authenticated version, also known as the Station-to-Station protocol:

""Roughly speaking, the basic idea is as follows. Prior to execution of
  the protocol, the two parties Alice and Bob each obtain a
  public/private key pair and a certificate for the public key. During
  the protocol, Alice computes a signature on certain messages, covering
  the public value ga mod p. Bob proceeds in a similar way. Even though
  Carol is still able to intercept messages between Alice and Bob, she
  cannot forge signatures without Alice's private key and Bob's private
  key. Hence, the enhanced protocol defeats the man-in-the-middle
  attack.""

So the basic version is susceptible to a man-in-the-middle attack, the authenticated version that uses public key certificates is not.

","Edit: As of Git version 1.7.9, it is possible to sign Git commits (git commit -S). Updating the answer slightly to reflect this. 
The question title is:

Is there a way to “autosign” commits in Git with a GPG key?

Short answer: yes, but don't do it. 
Addressing the typo in the question: git commit -s does not sign the commit. Rather, from the man git-commit page:

-s, --signoff
         Add Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit log message.

This gives a log output similar to the following:

± $ git log                                                                                 [0:43:31]

Note the ""Signed-off-by: ..."" bit; that was generated by the -s flag on the git-commit. 
Quoting the release announcement email:


""git commit"" learned ""-S"" to GPG-sign the commit; this can be shown
  with the ""--show-signature"" option to ""git log"".


So yes, you can sign commits. However, I personally urge caution with this option; automatically signing commits is next to pointless, see below:

Just a side question, maybe commits shouldn't be signed, only tags, which I never create, as I submit single commits. 

That's correct. Commits are not signed; tags are. The reason for this can be found in this message by Linus Torvalds, the last paragraph of which says:

Signing 
  each commit is totally stupid. It just means that you automate it, and you 
  make the signature worth less. It also doesn't add any real value, since 
  the way the git DAG-chain of SHA1's work, you only ever need one 
  signature to make all the commits reachable from that one be effectively 
  covered by that one. So signing each commit is simply missing the point. 

I'd encourage a browse of the linked message, which clarifies why signing commits automatically is not a good idea in a far better way than I could. 
However, if you want to automatically sign a tag, you would be able to do that by wrapping the git-tag -[s|u] in an alias; if you're going to do that, you probably want to setup your key id in ~/.gitconfig or the project-specific .git/config file. More information about that process can be seen in the git community book. Signing tags is infinitely more useful than signing each commit you make.

","You need to make clear that if you sign a commit or tag, that you do not mean that you approve the whole history. In case of commits you only sign the change at hand, and in case of tag, well.. you need to define what you mean with it. You might have pulled a change which claims it is from you but was not (because somebody else pushed it to your remote). Or it is a change you dont want to be in, but you just signed the tag.
In typical OSS projects this might be less common, but in a enterprise scenario where you only touch code every now and then and you don't read the whole history it might get unnoticed.
Signing commits is a problem if they will get rebased or cherry-picked to other parents. But it would be good if a modified commit could point to the ""original"" commit which actually verifies.

","Note: if you don't want to add -S all the time to make sure your commits are signed, there is a proposal (branch 'pu' for now, December 2013, so no guarantee it will make it to a git release) to add a config which will take care of that option for you.
Update May 2014: it is in Git 2.0 (after being resend in this patch series)
See commit 2af2ef3 by Nicolas Vigier (boklm):
Add the commit.gpgsign option to sign all commits

If you want to GPG sign all your commits, you have to add the -S option all the time.
  The commit.gpgsign config option allows to sign all commits automatically.

commit.gpgsign


A boolean to specify whether all commits should be GPG signed.
  Use of this option when doing operations such as rebase can result in a large number of commits being signed. It may be convenient to use an agent to avoid typing your GPG passphrase several times.


That config is usually set per repo (you don't need to sign your private experimental local repos):
cd /path/to/repo/needing/gpg/signature
git config commit.gpgsign true

You would combine that with user.signingKey used as a global setting (unique key used for all repo where you want to sign commit)
git config --global user.signingkey F2C7AB29


user.signingKey was introduced in git 1.5.0 (Jan. 2007) with commit d67778e:

There shouldn't be a requirement that I use the same form of my name in
  my git repository and my gpg key.
  Further I might have multiple keys in my keyring, and might want to use one that doesn't match up with the address I use in commit messages.
This patch adds a configuration entry ""user.signingKey"" which, if present, will be passed to the ""-u"" switch for gpg, allowing the tag signing key to be overridden.

This is enforced with commit aba9119 (git 1.5.3.2) in order to catch the case where If the user has misconfigured user.signingKey in their .git/config or just doesn't have any secret keys on their keyring.
Notes:

By convention, since git 2.4.0 March 2015, it is signingKey, not signingkey, even though the git config keys are case insensitive. That would matter only if you do git config --get-regexp, which is case sensitive, otherwise, it is only a readability convention;
If you want the git server to check the signature for each push, you will need git 2.2+ (Oct. 2014) at least (commit b945901), as git push --signed failed to consider the user.signingKey config value;
git 2.9 (June 2016) will use user.signingKey to force signing annotated tags as well as commits: commit 61c2fe0.

","PyMe does claim full compatibility with Python 2.4, and I quote:

The latest version of PyMe (as of this
  writing) is v0.8.0. Its binary
  distribution for Debian was compiled
  with SWIG v1.3.33 and GCC v4.2.3 for
  GPGME v1.1.6 and Python v2.3.5,
  v2.4.4, and v2.5.2 (provided in
  'unstable' distribution at the time).
  Its binary distribution for Windows
  was compiled with SWIG v1.3.29 and
  MinGW v4.1 for GPGME v1.1.6 and Python
  v2.5.2 (although the same binary get
  installed and works fine in v2.4.2 as
  well).

I'm not sure why you say ""it doesn't seem to be compatible with Python 2.4 which I have to use"" -- specifics please?
And yes it does exist as a semi-Pythonic (SWIGd) wrapper on GPGME -- that's a popular way to develop Python extensions once you have a C library that basically does the job.
PyPgp has a much simpler approach -- that's why it's a single, simple Python script: basically it does nothing more than ""shell out"" to command-line PGP commands. For example, decryption is just:
def decrypt(data):
    ""Decrypt a string - if you have the right key.""
    pw,pr = os.popen2('pgpv -f')
    pw.write(data)
    pw.close()
    ptext = pr.read()
    return ptext

i.e., write the encrypted cyphertext to the standard input of pgpv -f, read pgpv's standard output as the decrypted plaintext.
PyPgp is also a very old project, though its simplicity means that making it work with modern Python (e.g., subprocess instead of now-deprecated os.popen2) would not be hard. But you still do need PGP installed, or PyPgp won't do anything;-).

","You don't need PyCrypto or PyMe, fine though those packages may be - you will have all kinds of problems building under Windows. Instead, why not avoid the rabbit-holes and do what I did? Use gnupg 1.4.9. You don't need to do a full installation on end-user machines - just gpg.exe and iconv.dll from the distribution are sufficient, and you just need to have them somewhere in the path or accessed from your Python code using a full pathname. No changes to the registry are needed, and everything (executables and data files) can be confined to a single folder if you want.
There's a module GPG.py which was originally written by Andrew Kuchling, improved by Richard Jones and improved further by Steve Traugott. It's available here, but as-is it's not suitable for Windows because it uses os.fork(). Although originally part of PyCrypto, it is completely independent of the other parts of PyCrypto and needs only gpg.exe/iconv.dll in order to work.
I have a version (gnupg.py) derived from Traugott's GPG.py, which uses the subprocess module. It works fine under Windows, at least for my purposes - I use it to do the following:

Key management - generation, listing, export etc.
Import keys from an external source (e.g. public keys received from a partner company)
Encrypt and decrypt data
Sign and verify signatures

The module I've got is not ideal to show right now, because it includes some other stuff which shouldn't be there - which means I can't release it as-is at the moment. At some point, perhaps in the next couple of weeks, I hope to be able to tidy it up, add some more unit tests (I don't have any unit tests for sign/verify, for example) and release it (either under the original PyCrypto licence or a similar commercial-friendly license). If you can't wait, go with Traugott's module and modify it yourself - it wasn't too much work to make it work with the subprocess module.
This approach was a lot less painful than the others (e.g. SWIG-based solutions, or solutions which require building with MinGW/MSYS), which I considered and experimented with. I've used the same (gpg.exe/iconv.dll) approach with systems written in other languages, e.g. C#, with equally painless results.
P.S. It works with Python 2.4 as well as Python 2.5 and later. Not tested with other versions, though I don't foresee any problems.

So I need to find a Python library that will let me generate public and private PGP keys, and also decrypt files encrypted with the public key.
Is this something pyCrypto will do (documentation is nebulous)?  Are there other pure Python libraries?  How about a standalone command line tool in any language?
All I saw so far was GNUPG but installing that on Windows does stuff to the registry and throws dll's everywhere, and then I have to worry about whether the user already has this installed, how to backup their existing keyrings, etc.  I'd rather just have a python library or command line tool and mange the keys myself.
Update: pyME might work but it doesn't seem to be compatible with Python 2.4 which I have to use.
","As other have noted, PyMe is the canonical solution for this, since it's based on GpgME, which is part of the GnuPG ecosystem.
For Windows, I strongly recommend to use Gpg4win as the GnuPG distribution, for two reasons:
It's based on GnuPG 2, which, among other things, includes gpg2.exe, which can (finally, I might add :) start gpg-agent.exe on-demand (gpg v1.x can't).
And secondly, it's the only official Windows build by the GnuPG developers. E.g. it's entirely cross-compiled from Linux to Windows, so not a iota of non-free software was used in preparing it (quite important for a  security suite :).

","After a LOT of digging, I found a package that worked for me. Although it is said to support the generation of keys, I didn't test it. However I did manage to decrypt a message that was encrypted using a GPG public key. The advantage of this package is that it does not require a GPG executable file on the machine, and is a Python based implementation of the OpenPGP (rather than a wrapper around the executable). 
I created the private and public keys using GPG4win and kleopatra for windows
See my code below.
import pgpy
emsg = pgpy.PGPMessage.from_file(<path to the file from the client that was encrypted using your public key>)
key,_  = pgpy.PGPKey.from_file(<path to your private key>)
with key.unlock(<your private key passpharase>):
    print (key.decrypt(emsg).message)

Although the question is very old. I hope this helps future users.

Is Elliptic Curve Ephemeral diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) is better than DHE ? 
","It's the ephemeral aspect of DHE and ECDHE that provides perfect forward secrecy.
The idea is that even if someone records traffic and compromises the server to get its private key, they won't be able to decipher that traffic, because they'll be missing the ephemeral DH parameters that won't have been saved. With fixed DH, the private DH parameters are effectively the private key: they would also be compromised in the same way and allow the attacker to decipher past traffic too.
(Note that support for fixed DH, non-anonymous cipher suites is quite rare in practice anyway.)
The perfect forward secrecy offered by DHE comes at a price: more computation. The ECDHE variants uses elliptic curve cryptography to reduce this computational cost. You may find further details and benchmarks in Vincent Bernat's SSL/TLS & Perfect Forward Secrecy article.

Even more strange, is that when I have both password & public key enabled in sshd_config, it will only attempt to use keys and then bomb out with the above message and won't even try to use password.

Updated sshd_config, to enabled key auth - restart opensshd
Test connection and get above error, also doesn't even try password auth?
Updated sshd_config, to disable password auth completely - restart opensshd
Test connection and still get above error

It appears the server is killing the connection for some reason?
","I have solved the issue...
It is related to the account that started the service - its was using the Local System account - this was stopping it accessing the pub key and authorized_keys file.
Once I stopped the service and started as the user I was trying to connect into, it worked!
So basically, you need to start with a service account and then external users connect in as that user.

","If you are using mls-software.com's version of OpenSSH here is another note.
If you install using the SSHD_SERVER account and privilege separation you will be able to use public key authentication (per http://www.mls-software.com/opensshd-pki.html). However if UAC is enable you will not be successful with the install. The user(s) will not be created properly and the service will not be created. Manually trying to get these items up after the fact is very difficult. Simply disabling UAC before installation will allow the installation process to properly create the user(s) and the service. After installation you can re-enable UAC.
When I created the SSHD_SERVER account manually authentication succeed when using password authentication but the client termination the connection with ""/bin/bash: Operation not permitted"". Authentication with public keys was closed by the server (original error posted by Cambolie).

So for the purposes of testing, I have been just trying to SSH to localhost, but even when tried remotely I get the same issue.
Even more strange, is that when I have both password & public key enabled in sshd_config, it will only attempt to use keys and then bomb out with the above message and won't even try to use password.
Here are the steps I have taken:

Install OpenSSH for Windows
mkgroup -l >>..\etc\group (added local groups)
mkgroup -d >>..\etc\group (added domain groups)
mkpasswd -L -u openssh >>..\passwd (added my local user)
mkpasswd -D -u jsadmint2232 >>..\passwd (added my domain user)
Edited the homedir in passwd to point to c:\sshusers\%USER% - where %USER% is the user name
Enabled password auth, disabled key auth
Created ssh keys for both jsadmint2232 / openssh and ensured that the files were created in homedirs
Added authorized_keys files into .ssh dirs for each user and added keys for incoming connecting users
net stop opensshd / net start opensshd
Test Password auth works both locally and remotely
Updated sshd_config, to enabled key auth - restart opensshd
Test connection and get above error, also doesn't even try password auth?
Updated sshd_config, to disable password auth completely - restart opensshd
Test connection and still get above error

It appears the server is killing the connection for some reason?
","I solved it by:

Installing in SSHD_SERVER + privilege separation mode. I also set privilege separation to ""yes"" in the config manually. This didn't work for me for a lot time, the user didn't get created. Then it worked, I don't know why. I only went to user accounts in control panel to check that UAC is off. I also had /var/empty with full access for everyone.
For C:\openssh\var\empty I've set ""attributes get/set"" permissions to Everyone and myself and ""full"" permissions to .\sshd_server. I also made it the owner.

","Following are setup steps for OpenSSH shipped with Windows 10 v.1803 (April 2018 update. See comments to this post, it might not work with 1809).
Server setup (elevated powershell):

Install OpenSSH server: Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0.
Start agent and sshd services: Start-Service ssh-agent; Start-Service sshd (this will generate host keys and default configuration automatically in $env:ProgramData\ssh).
[Optional] Install OpenSSHUtils powershell module: Install-Module -Force OpenSSHUtils

Client setup (non-elevated powershell):

Generate user key: cd $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh; ssh-keygen.exe, follow prompts, agree to the default suggested file location. This will create 2 files: id_rsa and id_rsa.pub;
[Optional] add key to authentication agent, so you don't have to enter password each time you use it: ssh-add .\id_rsa (or whatever file was generated);

Server setup continued (non-elevated powershell):

Log in as a user, for which public key auth to be used
cd $env:USERPROFILE; mkdir .ssh; cd .ssh; New-Item authorized_keys;
Paste the contents of the id_rsa.pub file from the client to the .ssh\authorized_keys file from the previous step.
Setup permissions properly (important!!!): 


Run start . to open explorer with the current folder ($env:USERPROFILE\.ssh);
Right click authorized_keys, go to Properties -> Security -> Advanced
Click ""Disable inheritance"";
Choose ""Convert inherited permissions into explicit permissions on this object"" when prompted;
(really, really important) Remove all permissions on file except for the SYSTEM and yourself. There must be exactly two permission entries on the file. Some guides suggest running the Repair-AuthorizedKeyPermission $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\authorized_keys - this will try to add the sshd user to the permission list and it will break the authentication, so, don't do that, or at least do not agree on adding the sshd user). Both SYSTEM and yourself should have full control over the file.

If your Windows build is 1809 or later, it is required to comment out the following lines in C:\ProgramData\ssh\sshd_config file. Then restart the sshd service.

# Match Group administrators                                                    
#       AuthorizedKeysFile __PROGRAMDATA__/ssh/administrators_authorized_keys  


Client:

Run ssh <serverusername>@<serverhostname>. It should work at this point.

Tried that with Windows 10 as server and both itself and a Debian Linux as a client.

Thanks in advance.
","I had the same issue after copying my key pair from one machine to another. The solution for me was the set the trust level of the keys:
gpg --edit-key <KEY_ID>
gpg> trust

You will be asked to select the trust level from the following:
1 = I don't know or won't say
2 = I do NOT trust
3 = I trust marginally
4 = I trust fully
5 = I trust ultimately
m = back to the main menu

I selected 5 since I created the key so of course I trust it ultimately :). It will ask you to confirm your decision:
Your decision? 5
Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y

After confirming, you should be able to encrypt using that key.

This is another method to send the key, using netcat, so you don't have to authenticate.  It will only work over a local network, but you can use port forwarding to do this over the internet.  
On the server: 
$ nc -l 55555 >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

$ nc HOSTNAME 55555 < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

"25622894","java.security.InvalidKeyException: invalid key format on generating RSA public key","Background:
I have created an applet to extract public key of a certificate extracted from a smart card.
This public key is then stored in database.
The private key of certificate is used to sign data and the public key is then used to verify the signature.
Code for extracting public key from certificate:
private byte[] getPublicKey(KeyStore paramKeyStore)
    throws GeneralSecurityException {
  Enumeration localEnumeration = paramKeyStore.aliases();

  if (localEnumeration.hasMoreElements()) {
    String element = (String) localEnumeration.nextElement();
    Certificate[] arrayOfCertificate =
        paramKeyStore.getCertificateChain(element);
    byte[] publicKeyByteArray =
        arrayOfCertificate[0].getPublicKey().getEncoded();

    return publicKeyByteArray;
  }
  throw new KeyStoreException(""The keystore is empty!"");
}

This publicKeyByteArray is then storeed in database as BLOB after converting to string using bytes2String method:
private static String bytes2String(byte[] bytes) {
  StringBuilder string = new StringBuilder();
  for (byte b : bytes) {
    String hexString = Integer.toHexString(0x00FF & b);
    string.append(hexString.length() == 1 ? ""0"" + hexString : hexString);
  }
  return string.toString();
}

The content of the BLOB(key) saved in database is:
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

After reading the stored public key byte[] from database, I try to convert it back to Public Key using following code: 
Cipher rsa;
rsa = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");
KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
X509EncodedKeySpec publicKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(pkey.getBytes());
PublicKey pk = keyFactory.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);
rsa.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, pk);
byte[] cipherDecrypt = rsa.doFinal(encryptedText.getBytes());

but it gives following error:
Caused by: java.security.InvalidKeyException: invalid key format
    at sun.security.x509.X509Key.decode(X509Key.java:387)

    at sun.security.rsa.RSAKeyFactory.generatePublic(RSAKeyFactory.java:298)
    at sun.security.rsa.RSAKeyFactory.engineGeneratePublic(RSAKeyFactory.java:201)

Please suggest the reason and resolution for this issue.
","You must have an error in the way you read the key back from the database. The following code works just fine for me:
String key = ""3082012230...""; // full key omitted for brevity
byte[] derPublicKey = DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary(key);

KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
X509EncodedKeySpec publicKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(derPublicKey);
keyFactory.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);

I would guess, based on the use of pkey.getBytes(), that you've simply tried to get the bytes from the string rather than hex-decoding it.

","Yes, it is.
The output-size should always equals the size of the Modulus (part of the key), so:
2048 bit Modulus -> 2048 bit output
1024 bit Modulus -> 1024 bit output
...

If it is not, there exist numerous attacks on RSA, see here for basic information about that.
So to guarantee that the output is 2048 bit even when the input to encrypt is, let's say 7, a padding must always be applied!

","The output size of plain RSA (using some padding scheme, but no hybrid encryption) is always the key size. The reason is that for some public key n the result is some integer c with 0<=c<n.  There are lots of introductions for RSA, e.g. http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-045j-automata-computability-and-complexity-spring-2011/lecture-notes/MIT6_045JS11_rsa.pdf

","The output (as integer) of RSAEP (RSA encryption primitive) is always between 0 and n:

If the message representative m is not between 0 and n-1, output
message representative out of range and stop.
Let c = m^e mod n.
Output c.

Of course, c is a number. So you have to convert it to bytes for it to be usable. The only thing known about c is that it is smaller than n for a large value of m. It may be that c is a few bytes smaller even if m is large.

You've mentioned PKCS1Padding, which is part of the RSAES-PKCS1-V1_5-ENCRYPT encryption scheme. The padding will make sure that m is always large and randomized; requirements for RSA encryption to be secure.
You'll find that the encoding of c is specified in there:
...
Step 4: Convert the ciphertext representative c to a ciphertext C of
   length k octets: C = I2OSP (c, k)
...
where k is the size of the modulus in octets (bytes).
So yes, the answer is always k, the size of the modulus in bytes. Simply because the standard requires it that way. It is a value encoded as unsigned big endian number prefixed with as many zero bytes as required. 

Notes:

the modulus size defines the key size. So the output of an RSA encryption is the same as the key size: ceil(keySize / 8.0) using floats or (keySize + 8 - 1) / 8 using integers.
RSA with OAEP padding uses the same technique, so the answer is correct for OAEP as well (and most other, less known schemes such as RSA-KEM).
Many library routines that perform ""raw"" RSA (just modular exponentiation of the message with the public exponent) still perform the I2OSP function - but better check to make sure.

","Firstly, it looks like you're initializing both ciphers with the public key. Encryption uses public key, decryption used private key. I hope that's just a typo though.

Solution 2:
Turn a directory into a file                                                  
If you want to encrypt a directory, you will need to convert it to a file first. Run the command:
tar czf myfiles.tar.gz mydirectory/

This gives you a new file 'myfiles.tar.gz' which you can then encrypt/decrypt. To turn a tarball back into a directory:
tar xzf myfiles.tar.gz

now you can use encrypt in the same way that you have above. So:
gpg --encrypt --recipient xxx@mail.com ~/xxx/xxx.txt

Note Well: As emboss mentions in the comments, this answer is a poor fit for an actual system.

","I'm afraid you are mixing two concepts here, authentication/authorization and confidentiality, trying to cover both aspects in one single step, and that won't work. You should never encrypt ""real data"" with asymmetric algorithms. a) they are way too slow for that, b) there are subtle issues that, if not done right, will severely weaken the security of your solution. 
A good rule of thumb is that the only thing you should end up encrypting with private asymmetric keys is symmetric keys used by a much faster symmetric algorithm. But in almost all cases you shouldn't even be doing that, because in 90% of the cases what you actually want is TLS (SSL) in those cases - I tried to explain why here a while ago.
In your case, I assume the requirements are:

confidentiality of the data that is to be stored in the database: the general public shouldn't be able to read it (or even access it)
a selected few (probably just one person) should be able to access and read that data

The first goal is generally achieved by using symmetric encryption. The second goal is, albeit related, realized by quite different means. You want the user accessing the file to be authenticated (i.e. establish the identity) and on top of that you also want them to be authorized (i.e. check whether the established identity has the right to do what they intend to). This is where asymmetric cryptography may enter the stage, but not necessarily. Since your question is tagged with Rails I assume we are talking about a Rails application. You typically already have some means to authenticate and authorize users there (most likely involving the afore-mentioned TLS), you may simply reuse them in order to establish a symmetric key for actual file encryption/decryption. Password-based encryption would fit for this purpose, if you want to avoid asymmetric crypto at all. Things get even more complicated if you also want to ensure integrity of the already confidential data, that is, you want to give a kind of guarantee to the authenticated and authorized user in the sense that what they finally access has not been altered in any way in the meantime. 
Developing a solution for this will be no trivial task and depend to a large extent on your given requirements, so I'm afraid there's no ""golden way"" that suits everyone. I would suggest to do some research, get a clearer picture of what you are trying to achieve and how, then try to get additional advice on subjects that you still feel uncertain/uncomfortable with.

","Symmetric Encryption is definitely fast and has excellent support for streaming of very large files.
SymmetricEncryption::Writer.open('my_file.enc') do |file|
  file.write ""Hello World\n""

Symmetric Encryption is designed for encrypting data and large files within an organization. 
When it comes to sharing files with other organizations then the best option is PGP. For streaming of very large files with PGP consider: IOStreams
IOStreams.writer('hello.pgp', recipient: 'receiver@example.org') do |writer|
  writer.write('Hello World')
  writer.write('and some more')
end

Look at the file iostreams/lib/io_streams/pgp.rb for more PGP examples. It also supports PGP key management directly from Ruby.

","I'll assume you're on windows.
The way I did it was to install the certificate.  Open certificates (from mmc or directly)  Open the certificate in question.
In the details tab, there is the option to 'Copy To File'. Press next until it gives you the export file format.
Select Base-64 encoded X.509 (.cer).  Save to Desktop.  
If you open this file with notepad, it will display the base64 encoded public key in between the ----BEGIN CERTIFICATE---- and -----END CERTIFICATE------
Edit:
I save this base64 string and then convert back in code to get the actual certificate. It's pretty easy.
var base64Cert = // read from Db or somewhere
var base64EncodedStr = Encoding.Unicode.GetString(base64Cert);
var cert = new X509Certificate2(Convert.FromBase64String(base64EncodedStr), ""password"", X509KeyStorageFlags.PersistKeySet);
if(cert != null)
{
    // use certificate

"6309958","Encrypting a file with RSA in Python","I'm implementing file encryption with RSA, using PyCrypto.
I know it's somewhat wrong, first of all because RSA is very slow and second because PyCrypto RSA can only encrypt 128 characters, so you have to explode the file in 128 characters chunks.
This is the code so far:
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

file_to_encrypt = open('my_file.ext', 'rb').read()
pub_key = open('my_pub_key.pem', 'rb').read()
o = RSA.importKey(pub_key)

to_join = []
step = 0

while 1:
    # Read 128 characters at a time.
    s = file_to_encrypt[step*128:(step+1)*128]
    if not s: break
    # Encrypt with RSA and append the result to list.
    # RSA encryption returns a tuple containing 1 string, so i fetch the string.
    to_join.append(o.encrypt(s, 0)[0])
    step += 1

# Join the results.
# I hope the \r\r\r sequence won't appear in the encrypted result,
# when i explode the string back for decryption.
encrypted = '\r\r\r'.join(to_join)
# Write the encrypted file.
open('encrypted_file.ext', 'wb').write(encrypted)

So my question is : are there any better methods for using Private/ Public key encryption ON FILES ?
I heard about Mcrypt and OpenSSL, but I don't know if they can encrypt files.
","Public-key cryptography is usually used for small amounts of data only. It is slow, and can be hard to use right. The usual practice is to use other methods to reduce the asymmetric problem to one where the security is provided by a shared key, then use public-key cryptography to protect that shared key. For example:

To encrypt a file, randomly generate a secret key for a block or stream cipher (e.g. AES). Store the data encrypted with this cipher, and store the secret key encrypted with the public key alongside the encrypted payload.
To sign a file, compute a cryptographic digest (e.g. SHA-256). Sign the digest of the file with the private key and store that alongside the file.

So here's a sketch of how encryption can look like (warning, untested code, typed directly in the browser):
import os
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
import Crypto.Util.number
def encrypt_file(rsa, input, output):
    # Generate secret key
    secret_key = os.urandom(16)
    # Padding (see explanations below)
    plaintext_length = (Crypto.Util.number.size(rsa.n) - 2) / 8
    padding = '\xff' + os.urandom(16)
    padding += '\0' * (plaintext_length - len(padding) - len(secret_key))
    # Encrypt the secret key with RSA
    encrypted_secret_key = rsa.encrypt(padding + secret_key, None)
    # Write out the encrypted secret key, preceded by a length indication
    output.write(str(len(encrypted_secret_key)) + '\n')
    output.write(encrypted_secret_key)
    # Encrypt the file (see below regarding iv)
    iv = '\x00' * 16
    aes_engine = AES.new(secret_key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    output.write(aes_engine.encrypt(input.read()))

The iv is an initialization vector for the CBC mode of operation. It needs to be unique per key per message. Normally, it's sent alongside the data in cleartext. Here, since the key is only ever used once, you can use a known IV.
The API of the block cipher is described in PEP 272. Unfortunately, it only supports all-at-once encryption. For large files, it would be better to encrypt chunk by chunk; you can encrypt as little as a block at a time (16 bytes for AES), but you need a better crypto library for that.
Note that in general, you should not directly encrypt data with RSA. The most obvious concern is that the attacker knows the public key and can therefore attempt to guess the plaintext (if the attacker thinks the plaintext may be swordfish, then the attacker can encrypt swordfish with the RSA public key, and compare the result with the output of the RSA encryption). Another concern which would arise if you wanted to send the file to multiple recipients is that if the RSA encryption step is deterministic, then the attacker can tell that the plaintexts are the same because the ciphertexts are the same. The normal defense against these problems is to use a padding scheme, which consists of adding some random secret data to the plaintext; this data is called padding. The attacker then cannot guess the random data, and sees different outcomes for every encryption because the same plaintext is never encrypted twice; as far as the legitimate recipient is concerned, the padding is just data that can be thrown away.
Here, it may appear that the above concerns do not apply in this scenario. However, there are other weaknesses that can arise from using RSA unprotected. In particular, if the public exponent is very small (not the case here as PyCrypto uses 65537) or you encrypt the same material for many different recipients (again, probably not the case here since each message has its own secret key), then a simple mathematical calculation would allow the attacker to recover the RSA plaintext. To avoid this attack, the value that is encrypted with RSA needs to be “close enough” to the RSA modulus, so that the encryption operation actually performs a modular exponentiation. The padding I propose ensures that by making the highest-order byte that fits 0xff; this is believed to be safe, although in the real world you should used an approved padding mode (OAEP).

I can't figure out however how to create the String representation of the PrivateKey and PublicKey in the KeyPair.
","The key format used by ssh is defined in the RFC #4253. The format for RSA public key is the following :
  string    ""ssh-rsa""
  mpint     e /* key public exponent */
  mpint     n /* key modulus */

All data type encoding is defined in the section #5 of RFC #4251. string and mpint (multiple precision integer) types are encoded this way :
  4-bytes word: data length (unsigned big-endian 32 bits integer)
  n bytes     : binary representation of the data

for instance, the encoding of the string ""ssh-rsa"" is:
  byte[] data = new byte[] {0, 0, 0, 7, 's', 's', 'h', '-', 'r', 's', 'a'};

To encode the public :
   public byte[] encodePublicKey(RSAPublicKey key) throws IOException
   {
       ByteArrayOutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
       /* encode the ""ssh-rsa"" string */
       byte[] sshrsa = new byte[] {0, 0, 0, 7, 's', 's', 'h', '-', 'r', 's', 'a'};
       out.write(sshrsa);
       /* Encode the public exponent */
       BigInteger e = key.getPublicExponent();
       byte[] data = e.toByteArray();
       encodeUInt32(data.length, out);
       out.write(data);
       /* Encode the modulus */
       BigInteger m = key.getModulus();
       data = m.toByteArray();
       encodeUInt32(data.length, out);
       out.write(data);
       return out.toByteArray();
   }

   public void encodeUInt32(int value, OutputStream out) throws IOException
   {
       byte[] tmp = new byte[4];
       tmp[0] = (byte)((value >>> 24) & 0xff);
       tmp[1] = (byte)((value >>> 16) & 0xff);
       tmp[2] = (byte)((value >>> 8) & 0xff);
       tmp[3] = (byte)(value & 0xff);
       out.write(tmp);
   }

To have a string représentation of the key just encode the returned byte array in Base64. 
For the private key encoding there is two cases:

the private key is not protected by a password. In that case the private key is encoded according to the PKCS#8 standard and then encoded with Base64. It is possible to get the PKCS8 encoding of the private key by calling getEncoded on RSAPrivateKey.
the private key is protected by a password. In that case the key encoding is an OpenSSH dedicated format. I don't know if there is any documentation on this format (except the OpenSSH source code of course)

","There appears to be nothing wrong with the encryption/decryption code, just how you're handling the decrypted data. Specifically this line:
lblDecript.Text = Convert.ToBase64String(plainText);

You are taking the decrypted data and Base64 encoding it, which is why you get: dGVzdGluZw== (since this is the Base64 encoded version of the string ""testing"").
You need to use the following instead:
lblDecript.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(plainText);

This should correctly convert the decrypted byte array to a the original string.

","Even if you encrypt the jar file, it must be decrypted before the JVM is able to run it, so you'll need another jar file containing classes that decrypt and loads in the JVM.
Since this second jar file cannot be itself encrypted, a malicious user wanting to see you class files, can simply look at classes in this second jar file, and then decrypt your super-secret jar file and have access to it.
Maybe you can increase security of your code using an obfuscator, but it will eventually protect (make it harder but not impossible) your class files from decompilation, not from being used.
If obfuscation is not enough, you could consider compiling your jar file to a DLL for windows or a SO for unix/linux, that will make it much harder to decompile, but it's not always possible to do that correctly and it's generally a PITA. GCJ is able to do this somehow, and there are other commercial products that will actually compile .class/.jar directly to machine code.
However please consider that it does not matter how much security you put in it, since the client computer MUST be able to execute it, it must be able to read it, so no matter what your code will be exposed, you can only make it harder.
If you really have an algorithm so secret you don't want to disclose no matter what, consider converting it to a web service, hosting it on your server, so that you don't have to send the actual code to the client machines and can also better prevent unauthorized copies of your application by checking access to that vital part of it.

If you have the modulus and exponent bytes correctly collected, you can construct the the public key in form, understandable by OpenSSL, by concatenating these four things. You already have the first longer header. The ""middle header"" is '02 03':

'02' for the integer
length of the integer itself is 3 bytes (65537 = 01 00 01) 

If your modulus is 2048 bytes and exponent 3 bytes (so that the length fields remain valid), the PEM file can be produced by concatenating these four:
<header> <modulus> 0x02 0x03 <exponent>

That is why the last bytes from the binary dump differ from the OpenSSL output: the extracted 260 bytes do not contain 02 03, but instead record 65537 as 00 01 00 01 (not 01 00 01 as in ASN.1 encoding).
To summarize, you can produce the PEM file like this:
Convert your extracted modulus+exponent back from base64 and extract them (note the 257 byte offset to skip the leading zero byte of 65537!):
echo 'tZyrQA6cZFJfVm6FyXwtZaLQYg8EecuO+ObrHTwc8JO+XrgnpNAdmlhbAEPxSNnjwhNnbYGYGL4FvzmnZXzZU71Key42HQPh1k2Zx1UDbrH5ciODKx1ZbuEx8K24SHnL1nY/H75hwhT/ZRRVGQDvYDT+sgzw2vmV66+dflw1Zs8BLhqjLjczdHvjeVXsDRJ9Mvvd/dhFH8UlTf4JpLGya9nsNIfNBBIf1LllRWwCTiEIbaOMgWcLjLV/2tk/j5Dra/oQnVf/2hVsEF/hXEx41YjeEW/warweoDVG7zaxrHEc/k/rZCUCZKxf8nBKdqax/gRICvkG6e5xg2GQw0W/ZwABAAE=' | base64 -d > modulus-exp.bin
dd if=modulus-exp.bin of=modulus.bin bs=1 count=256
dd if=modulus-exp.bin of=exponent.bin bs=1 skip=257 count=3

Create the headers:
echo 'MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA' | base64 -d > header.bin
echo '02 03' | xxd -r -p > mid-header.bin

Concatenate them together:
cat header.bin modulus.bin mid-header.bin exponent.bin > key.der

Convert to PEM:
openssl pkey -inform der -outform pem -pubin -in key.der -out key.pem

Test that you get the working key - by checking it with ASN.1 decoder, or by
openssl asn1parse -in key.pem
openssl asn1parse -in key.pem -strparse 19

","key.pem can contain anything - a certificate with a public key, an SSH public key, public key + private key, certificate with a public key + private key. PEM is a text file so you can open it in notepad and check its contents. 
id_rsa is an SSH private key in OpenSSH format. id_rsa.pub is an SSH public key in OpenSSH format. 
.ppk file is Putty's private key (if memory serves).
To authenticate on remote server you give its admins your public key and use the private key in your SSH client. Alternatively (if admins give you the key pair), you use the private key from that keypair.

","What you mean is not called ""encryption"" but ""signing"" in gpg lingo.
Signing is basically encrypting with your private key and decrypting with the public key.
Use
 gpg --sign myfile.ext

Or use your email-client's signing capabilities.
Signing will obviously allow anybody who has access to your ""public"" key to read the contents of your file (and since a ""public"" key is usually, well..., public, this will allow everybody to decypher the content).
If you are looking for a method, where only the recipient can decode the content, then you need to encrypt the data in a way where only the recipient has access to the decrypting token. obviously the recipient need to have such a token (that is: you encode with their public key, so they can decode with their private key)
UPDATE
To make it simple: if you want to guarantee integrity (that is: the recipient knows for sure, that the data comes from you and nobody else), you need to sign the data.
If you want to guarantee confidentiality (that is: only your recipient can read the data), you need to encrypt the data.
Both signing and encryption are really the same thing.
The only difference is, who has access to the keys.
With signing, you use your private key to encrypt the data, and it can be decrypted with your public key (and since everybody has access to the public key, everybody can decrypt it, and thus everybody can validate that the data has been signed by you)
With encrypting, you use your recipients public key to encrypt the data, and they use their private key to decrypt it (so only they can read it; but everybody can send them an encrypted datum, they have no guarantee that it really comes from the sender, but it is guaranteed that only they can read it).
If you need both confidentiality and integrity, you need to do both signing and encryption, and for this to work, both you and your recipients need to have a (different) public/private key pair.
CONCLUSION
Since both signing and encrypting are the same thing, you can use both to guarantee validity and integrity of your data, as long as you have full control over the availability of the keys involved.

","It is not true that GnuPG requires you to publish your private key in order to encrypt a document. You should never publish your private key to anyone.
GnuPG supports two different encryption methods, asymmetric and symmetric encryption.
Asymmetric encryption requires to to know the public key of your recipient. This is usually not a problem because as the name already suggests these keys are not a secret but known to everyone. For decrypting it again only the private key can be used which is known only to your recipient. Asymmetric encryption using GnuPG is done with the --encrypt option.
If you don't know the public key of your recipient then you can use symmetric encryption where both parties share the same key. This requires a secure channel for transmitting the shared secret, of course. For symmetric encryption, use the --symmetric option. Neither a public nor a private key is required here but the secure exchange of the shared key makes symmetric encryption prone to attacks.
If you just need integrity and accountability (the document can't be modified without detecting it and you are able to verify who created/signed it) then you can use the --sign option to create a signature using your private key. Everybody having access to your public key can check this signature to verify both integrity and accountability. But note that everybody can read your original message content because this signature is no encryption. The resulting .gpg-file looks like binary data but only contains compressed but not encrypted text. You can also disable compression by specifying --compress-level 0 and you will see that the output file contains your original message in plaintext. So don't use this option if you want confidentiality.

","Simple answer: forget the idea of keys. You only need a shared secret passphrase. So get together with your client. Call them on the phone. Or if you're paranoid, do it face to face. Agree on a passphrase you will share and keep it as secret as you need to. Based on my experience, I recommend using diceware together to pick a shared passphrase. Both of you keep a secure copy of that shared secret. If you're paranoid, don't write it down—memorize it! Now you can encrypt anything using that shared secret as the passphrase. Any symmetric encryption tool can do that for you, including GPG.

","I am working on a similar problem: distribute software updates from a central source to be applied to many end-users in the field.  End users need to validate that the update came from the official source (signed with private key), but I also want the update to travel confidentially (encrypted).
In the cryptography course I had at University ~30 years ago now, they taught that encrypting with one's private key was the same thing as signing a message - when the recipient decrypts using the public key, the fact that they do not get gibberish confirms use of the private key to encrypt.  This also provides a measure of confidentiality if the public key is kept ""close to the vest,"" which would be my preferred implementation.
As mentioned by others, I have confirmed that the gpg --sign operation does not encrypt the message, the message is visible in plaintext in the signed file.  To use gpg to accomplish both certain authenticity with a signature from the private key, and a reasonable measure of confidentiality, I have settled on the solution of giving the field based receivers their own key pair, in addition to the public key of the update distributor.  This isn't a terribly secure solution, anyone can reverse engineer a device in the field and get ahold of the ""secret"" key that it will hold, with that they can decrypt the signed update message and see its cleartext contents.  What they cannot do is create a file with the distributor's secret key signature on it, and so they cannot make an update of their own that will be accepted by the devices in the field which are looking for both encryption with their public key, and a signature from the update distributor's privately held key.
It's a matter of degrees of exposure.  The updates in transit are secure from anyone who does not have access to an endpoint device to reverse engineer.  With physical access to an endpoint (something we cannot prevent), they will eventually be able to reverse engineer the installed software, and even the updates themselves, but they will never be able to sign their own update and push it to un-compromised machines.  At least as long as RSA is secure.

","There is a good summary of the common key formats here. As indicated by the javadocs for X509EncodedKeySpec this class is designed to convert between the SubjectPublicKeyInfo ASN.1 struct that is in the X.509 standard and Java public key formats. And since the first link indicated that a file of the form    

-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
  xxxx
  xxxx
  -----END PUBLIC KEY-----

is indeed a SubjectPublicKeyInfo, you are correctly parsing the file. There is one final step you're missing, and that's to convert your X509EncodedKeySpec into a public key. That is the function of the KeyFactory class. To extend your example by two more lines, it would be    
KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA""); // Assuming this is an RSA key
RSAPublicKey rsaPubKey = (RSAPublicKey) kf.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);

","The answer is not straightforward. Following code works for me when loading RSA public key string (encoded in PEM format as mentioned above) to java.security.PublicKey object. Note: the headers and ends should be stripped beforehand.
    public PublicKey convertToPublicKey(String publicKeyString) {
    try {
        byte[] decodedPublicKey = Base64.decode(publicKeyString, Base64.DEFAULT);
        org.spongycastle.asn1.ASN1InputStream in = new org.spongycastle.asn1.ASN1InputStream(decodedPublicKey);
        org.spongycastle.asn1.ASN1Primitive obj = in.readObject();
        org.spongycastle.asn1.pkcs.RSAPublicKey keyStruct = org.spongycastle.asn1.pkcs.RSAPublicKey.getInstance(obj);
        java.security.spec.RSAPublicKeySpec keySpec = new java.security.spec.RSAPublicKeySpec(keyStruct.getModulus(), keyStruct.getPublicExponent());
        java.security.KeyFactory keyFactory = java.security.KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
        return keyFactory.generatePublic(keySpec);
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (InvalidKeySpecException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return null;
}

Then, the java.security.PublicKey instance can be used to encrypt your string as follows:
Cipher rsaCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/None/PKCS1Padding"", ""SC"");
rsaCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, apiPublicKey);
byte[] ENCRYPTED_YOUR_STRING = rsaCipher.doFinal(YOUR_STRING);

The bytes can then be converted to string by:
    Base64.encodeToString(ENCRYPTED_YOUR_STRING, Base64.DEFAULT)

","It depends on the browser you're using, if you let me know I'll update my answer.
Chrome 55 and above You can now find this information in Developer Tools. Options (3 dots) -> More Tools -> Developer tools, or press F12, then click the ""Security"" tab and you'll get a ""Security Overview"" with a ""View certificate"" button. As per another SO post from Chrome 60 you can actually enable the option again if you go to chrome://flags/#show-cert-link.
Chrome 54 and below: If you're using Chrome then click on the green bar to the left of the 'https:' in the address bar, for the VeriSign website the green bar says Symantec Corperation [US], this will open a pop up. On the pop up click 'Certificate Information'. This will open another pop up. On this go the 'Details' tab at the top and scroll down to 'Public key' which shows the public key the website is using for it's SSL. In VeriSigns case the public key is a 2048 bit key.

IE: the green bar to click on is to the right of the web address. Clicking this brings a similar pop up where you have to click 'View certificates' which then brings up the same pop up as on Chrome where you go to the Details tab and scroll down to 'Public Key'

This is the pop up that opens after clicking the 'Certificate information' or 'View certificates' links.

GPL JavaScript Public Key Encryption

You should establish some salting mechanism to salt every encrypted value otherwise the key could get compromised.

","Only one problem: An attacker does not need to know the actual password. All he needs to see is the value that is sent to the server. This value allows the user to log in. It does not matter what that value is; whether it's plaintext, encrypted text or a picture of a cat. It's just a token that authenticates the user. If an attacker can see this token and repeat the same request and that same request allows him to log in, you gained nothing.

","RSA is overkill; what you probably need is a simple challenge-response protocol.  For example:

Generate a random nonce value; this helps prevent replay attacks.
Send that nonce value and the password salt to the browser along with the rest of the login form.

You are storing passwords in salted and hashed form, right?

When the user enters a password, have the script on the form compute and send back hash(hash(password, salt), nonce) instead.
When the server receives the form submission, have it compute hash(storedSaltedPassword, nonce) and verify that it equals the submitted value.

Retain the nonce value at the server; don't trust the client to echo it back to you, or your replay protection is gone.


The weakness of this scheme is that the password hashes in the database are in some sense password-equivalent; while it's likely infeasible to extract the original password used to produce those hashes, knowledge of the stored hash is sufficient to impersonate the user on your site.
SSL certificates serve an entirely different purpose: the purpose of an SSL certificate is to make it difficult for a third-party rogue server to claim to be your server, because it doesn't have a certificate signed by some mutually trusted third party that it belongs on your domain.  On the other hand, if you can't stop a rogue server from impersonating yours, you can't protect your users from giving their password to that rogue server, cryptography notwithstanding.

","You don't need to encrypt the password. You need to hash the password. You really really don't want to have any access to the plaintext password yourself whatsoever, otherwise you lose non-repudiation, which has serious legal consequences.

","The reason why you need encryption at all is probably to protect against a man-in-the-middle. There are scenarios where an attacker is able to sniff at the traffic without being able to change it. This solution would protect against that threat, but it would provide no protection at all against a man-in-the-middle that is able to modify the traffic. 
If the attacker can change the traffic, then he will also be able to change the script that does the encryption. The easiest attack would be to just remove the encryption completely from the script. If you don't have https, and a man-in-the-middle is possible (which is the case in almost every scenario) then you don't have any control at all over the html or javascript that is presented to the end user. The attacker may rewrite your html code and javascript completely, disablign encryption, creating new form fields in your form etc.  Https is a prerequisite for secure communication in the web-channel.

","I've done it. I use this JavaScript client-side asymetric RSA encryption to prevent the login credentials to be send in plain text over HTTP.
The goal is to prevent login request replay attacks based on network sniffing. Of course, this is not as secure as HTTPS since it would not resist to man-in-the-middle attacks, but it can be sufficient for local networks.
The client-side encryption uses Travis Tridwell's excellent work which is based on JSBN. Travis' web page can also generate the private and public RSA keys (if you are too lazy to use openssl). The keys are generated in PKCS#1 PEM format. I encrypt username+password+timeInMs+timezone so that the encrypted content changes at each login.
On the server-side, my Java code read read the PKCS#1 PEM file using Apache JMeter's org.apache.jmeter.protocol.oauth.sampler.PrivateKeyReader :
PrivateKey pk = (new PrivateKeyReader(""myPrivateKeyFile.pem"")).getPrivateKey();

Then I decrypt the encrypted content using 
byte[] enc = DatatypeConverter.parseBase64Binary(clientData);
Cipher rsa = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");
rsa.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, pk);
byte[] dec = rsa.doFinal(enc);
String out = new String(dec, ""UTF8"");

Then I check if the client-side timestamp/timezone match the server-side timestamp/timezone. If the delay is less than a few seconds, the login process continues. Otherwise the request is considered a replay attack and the login fails.

","asymmetric public key/ private key is the only way to do this. To protect against MIM attacks the server can hash the public key with the users password, then the user (in the browser) re-computes the hash - if they match then the user can be confident that the public key sent from the server has not been tampered with - this relies on the fact that only the server and the user know the users password.

","The problem is that you're trying to decrypt the base64 encoded result.
You should try to decrypt the result of the encryption.
That is, instead of:
int resultDecrypt = RSA_private_decrypt( RSA_size(privKey), retencrypted, decrypted, privKey, PADDING);

You should call:
int resultDecrypt = RSA_private_decrypt( RSA_size(privKey), encrypted, decrypted, privKey, PADDING);

Also, there is a problem in the encryption call:
int resultEncrypt = RSA_public_encrypt(PADDING, str, encrypted, pubKey, PADDING);

Why are you passing PADDING as flen? This should be the length of the string (i.e. 4 or 5, depending on whether you want to encrypt the null character).
If you want to write the encrypted string as ASCII (encoded using base64), that's fine. But you have to decode it back before you decrypt it.

","The error you're getting is block type is not 02.
Although Omri is correct that you're passing the wrong data, and you are only going to encrypt 1 byte, the error is because the sizeof( encrypted ) is way too large (2560).  In other words your data receiver for RSA_public_encrypt must be a regular unsigned char* pointer, not an unsigned char[2560].
Where you have
unsigned char encrypted[2560] = { 0 }; //X 2560?? RSA_public_encrypt fails.

You should be using
unsigned char *encrypted = (unsigned char*)malloc( rsa_length ) ;
RSA_public_encrypt( DATALEN, (const unsigned char*)str, encrypted, pubKey, PADDING ) ;

Notice the error Omri pointed out, that you used PADDING as the first arg to RSA_public_encrypt, while it should be the DATALEN data length.
If you fix that you'll get a similar error later with the private key decrypt.  Fix it and you're on your way.

let pubKeyData = pubKey.dataUsingEncoding(NSASCIIStringEncoding)
var error: Unmanaged<CFErrorRef>?
let secKey = SecKeyCreateFromData(NSDictionary(), pubKeyData!, &error)

Where pubKey is a string representation of your public key.
If you don't know your public key, you can infer it from your private key with the following command:
openssl rsa -in server.key -pubout  > mykey.pub

Where server.key is the file containing -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
as the first line.
For iOS:
It's a bit more complicate.
You need a der file. It's a binary representation of your certificate.
If you need to convert an existing certificate, you can do so with the following command:
 openssl x509 -outform der -in file.crt|pem -out mycert.der

The .crt or .pem file contains -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- as the first line.
Put the der file in your bundle and do:
let certificateData = NSData(contentsOfURL:NSBundle.mainBundle().URLForResource(""mycert"", withExtension: ""der"")!)

let certificate = SecCertificateCreateWithData(nil, certificateData!)

var trust: SecTrustRef?

let policy = SecPolicyCreateBasicX509()
let status = SecTrustCreateWithCertificates(certificate!, policy, &trust)

if status == errSecSuccess {
    let key = SecTrustCopyPublicKey(trust!)!;
}

Yatta ! Key now contains a SecKey representation of your public key. Happy Pinning.

Thank god, finally i've found a solution after a long research,
  googling/binging and hard work. Just Recap: Third party web service
  (coded in Java) with X509 SecurityToken Https certificate consume in
  .NET.
Yes, we can consume the above service using old technology using WSE
  2.0 / WSE 3.0 (Web Services Enhancements) and Latest using WCF. I've just tried using WSE 2.0 it's working as expected but with Error code 
  ""WSE464: No policy could be found for this message"" still i can able to get see response in try..catch block and use appropriate decrypt XML response message.

Steps followed

Install the client given certificate (.pfx)
Open Microsoft Management Console (MMC) in run command type mmc → Enter
a. File → Add/Remove snap in → Select certificate in list box → Click Add → Select My
           Current User → Finish –> Click Ok.
     b. Select Trusted Root Certification → Expand it → Select Certificate → Right click on           
         Certificate → Select All Tasks → Import → Select your Certificate location and finish the  
          wizard process

Repeat Step 2 for Local Machine (Local Computer)
Install Microsoft WSE (Web Services Enhancements) 2.0 SP3 / WSE 3.0    Note. WSE 2.0/3.0 will support .Net Framework 2.0 only.
http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=23689
Create new web application project in Visual Studio
Expand project → Right click on Reference → Add Service Reference → Advanced → Add Web Reference → Paste your Service WSDL link in URL text box → Click on Go button (Pointing right arrow) → Since it's https it will show with popup with warning message click Yes until it's stops → Enter Web Reference name and click Add Reference button
Right click → Reference → Add reference → Click Browse → \Program Files\Microsoft WSE\v2.0\ → Select “Microsoft.Web.Services2.dll” → Click Add 
Proxy/Stubbed class generated now → Look for Reference.cs file under Web Reference folder if not visible click Show all files in Solution Explorer. → Open Reference.cs file and Replace “System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapHttpClientProtocol” with “WebServicesClientProtocol”

                store.Close();
        }

        return token;
    }

}
Add the following code in in your page and Get  ClientBase64KeyId value from X509 Certficate Tool. 
Start → Program Files → Microsoft WSE 2.0 → X509 Certificate Tool → Select Certificate Location is Local Computer  → Sore Name is Personal → Click Open Certificate Button, listed with certificates and select appropriates which is one installed using MMC. Now pick the values from Key Identifier (Based64 Encoded) value and use it below code. If your application is Asp.Net Web application, it may not accessible so click 'View Private Keys File Properties' button and assign appropriate Security permission in the same tool itself.
Almost we've done 70% of work. Now it's very crucial part going to do now... Yes we're going to apply Policy details.This is all about Security Policy related to X509 Certificate which defines about what part it's going to Sign (Signature), Encryption, Integrity, Confidentiality and so on. Don't panic we have helper called WSE 2.0 Tool,
Yes chumma :) try it Start → Program Files → Microsoft WSE 2.0 → Configuration Editor → File → Open → Point to Web.config from your application
General => Check both the Check Boxes
Security, Routing and Customized Filters => They are not called me:) 
So Leave It.  
Policy => Very Important. 1. Check Enable Policy 2.Click Add → Name
it / Enter any name → Next → Leave it default (Secure Client
Application) → (Default) Next → Next → (Default: X509 Certificate) → 
Next → Select Certificate → Select appropriate certificate from the
list → Ok → Next → Finish
TokenIssuing => Leave it
Diagnostics => Check it appropriate check boxes for tracing and
logging purpose
File → Save → Close it :)
Now one would've created policyCache.config which is referenced in Web.config file. Here we have add our HTTPS service URL in . Done

This is achieved by WSE 2.0. Yes i know this is old technology. I am
trying to consume with WCF as Client... I will post it next session....
:) Happy Programming :)

"28444819","Getting BouncyCastle to decrypt a GPG-encrypted message","How can I get BouncyCastle to decrypt a GPG-encrypted message? 
I have created a GPG key pair at the CentOS 7 command line using gpg --gen-key.  I chose RSA RSA as the encryption types, and I exported the keys using gpg --export-secret-key -a ""User Name"" > /home/username/username_private.key and gpg --armor --export 66677FC6 > /home/username/username_pubkey.asc
I am able to import username_pubkey.asc into a remote Thunderbird client of another email account and successfully send an encrypted email to username@mydomain.com.  But when my Java/BouncyCastle code running at mydomain.com tries to decrypt the GPG-encoded data, it gives the following error:  
org.bouncycastle.openpgp.PGPException:  
Encrypted message contains a signed message - not literal data.

If you look at the code below, you will see this corresponds with the line in PGPUtils.decryptFile() which states else if (message instanceof  PGPOnePassSignatureList) {throw new PGPException(""Encrypted message contains a signed message - not literal data."");
The original code for this came from the blog entry at this link, though I made minor changes to get it to compile in Eclipse Luna with Java 7.  A user of the linked blog reported the same error, and the blog author replied by saying that it does not work with GPG.  So how do I fix this to make it work with GPG? 
The Java decryption code starts when the GPG-encoded-file and the GPG-secret-key are passed into Tester.testDecrypt() as follows:  
Tester.java contains:  
public InputStream testDecrypt(String input, String output, String passphrase, String skeyfile) throws Exception {
    PGPFileProcessor p = new PGPFileProcessor();
    p.setInputFileName(input);//this is GPG-encoded data sent from another email address using Thunderbird
    p.setOutputFileName(output);
    p.setPassphrase(passphrase);
    p.setSecretKeyFileName(skeyfile);//this is the GPG-generated key
    return p.decrypt();//this line throws the error
}

PGPFileProcessor.java includes:  
public InputStream decrypt() throws Exception {
    FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream(inputFileName);
    FileInputStream keyIn = new FileInputStream(secretKeyFileName);
    FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(outputFileName);
    PGPUtils.decryptFile(in, out, keyIn, passphrase.toCharArray());//error thrown here
    in.close();
    out.close();
    keyIn.close();
    InputStream result = new FileInputStream(outputFileName);//I changed return type from boolean on 1/27/15

I have read many postings and links about this.  In particular, this other SO posting looks similar, but is different.  My Keys use RSA RSA, but the other posting does not.  
EDIT#1 
As per @DavidHook's suggestion, I have read SignedFileProcessor, and I am starting to read the much longer RFC 4880.  However, I need actual working code to study in order to understand this.  Most people who find this via google searches will also need working code to illustrate the examples.  
For reference, the SignedFileProcessor.verifyFile() method recommended by @DavidHook is as follows.  How should this be customized to fix the problems in the code above? 
private static void verifyFile(InputStream in, InputStream keyIn) throws Exception {
    in = PGPUtil.getDecoderStream(in);
    PGPObjectFactory pgpFact = new PGPObjectFactory(in);
    PGPCompressedData c1 = (PGPCompressedData)pgpFact.nextObject();
    pgpFact = new PGPObjectFactory(c1.getDataStream());
    PGPOnePassSignatureList p1 = (PGPOnePassSignatureList)pgpFact.nextObject();
    PGPOnePassSignature ops = p1.get(0);
    PGPLiteralData p2 = (PGPLiteralData)pgpFact.nextObject();
    InputStream dIn = p2.getInputStream();
    int ch;
    PGPPublicKeyRingCollection  pgpRing = new PGPPublicKeyRingCollection(PGPUtil.getDecoderStream(keyIn));
    PGPPublicKey key = pgpRing.getPublicKey(ops.getKeyID());
    FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(p2.getFileName());
    ops.initVerify(key, ""BC"");
    while ((ch = dIn.read()) >= 0){
        ops.update((byte)ch);
        out.write(ch);
    }
    out.close();
    PGPSignatureList p3 = (PGPSignatureList)pgpFact.nextObject();
    if (ops.verify(p3.get(0))){System.out.println(""signature verified."");}
    else{System.out.println(""signature verification failed."");}
}

EDIT#2 
The SignedFileProcessor.verifyFile() method recommended by @DavidHook is almost identical to the PGPUtils.verifyFile() method in my code above, except that PGPUtils.verifyFile() makes a copy of extractContentFile and calls PGPOnePassSignature.init() instead of PGPOnePassSignature.initVerify().  This may be due to a version difference.  Also, PGPUtils.verifyFile() returns a boolean, while SignedFileProcessor.verifyFile() gives SYSO for the two boolean values and returns void after the SYSO.  
If I interpret @JRichardSnape's comments correctly, this means that the verifyFile() method might best be called upstream to confirm the signature of the incoming file using the sender's public key, and then, if the signature on the file is verified, using another method to decrypt the file using the recipient's private key.  Is this correct?  If so, how do I restructure the code to accomplish this?
","It just means that content has been signed and then encrypted, the routine provided does not know how to deal with it, but at least tells you that. PGP protocol presents as a series of packets some of which can be wrapped in other ones (for example compressed data can also wrap signed data or simply literal data, these can be used to generate encrypted data as well, actual content always appears in literal data).
If you look at the verifyFile method in the SignedFileProcessor in the Bouncy Castle OpenPGP examples package you will see how to handle the signature data and get to the literal data containing the actual content.
I would also recommend looking at RFC 4880 so you have some idea of how the protocol works. The protocol is very loose and both GPG, BC, and the variety of products out there reflect this - that said the looseness does mean that if you try and cut and paste your way to a solution you'll end up with a disaster. It's not complicated, but understanding is required here as well.

I have created a GPG key pair at the CentOS 7 command line using gpg --gen-key.  I chose RSA RSA as the encryption types, and I exported the keys using gpg --export-secret-key -a ""User Name"" > /home/username/username_private.key and gpg --armor --export 66677FC6 > /home/username/username_pubkey.asc
I am able to import username_pubkey.asc into a remote Thunderbird client of another email account and successfully send an encrypted email to username@mydomain.com.  But when my Java/BouncyCastle code running at mydomain.com tries to decrypt the GPG-encoded data, it gives the following error:  
org.bouncycastle.openpgp.PGPException:  
Encrypted message contains a signed message - not literal data.

If you look at the code below, you will see this corresponds with the line in PGPUtils.decryptFile() which states else if (message instanceof  PGPOnePassSignatureList) {throw new PGPException(""Encrypted message contains a signed message - not literal data."");
The original code for this came from the blog entry at this link, though I made minor changes to get it to compile in Eclipse Luna with Java 7.  A user of the linked blog reported the same error, and the blog author replied by saying that it does not work with GPG.  So how do I fix this to make it work with GPG? 
The Java decryption code starts when the GPG-encoded-file and the GPG-secret-key are passed into Tester.testDecrypt() as follows:  
Tester.java contains:  
public InputStream testDecrypt(String input, String output, String passphrase, String skeyfile) throws Exception {
    PGPFileProcessor p = new PGPFileProcessor();
    p.setInputFileName(input);//this is GPG-encoded data sent from another email address using Thunderbird
    p.setOutputFileName(output);
    p.setPassphrase(passphrase);
    p.setSecretKeyFileName(skeyfile);//this is the GPG-generated key
    return p.decrypt();//this line throws the error
}

","if anyone is interested to know how to encrypt and decrypt gpg files using bouncy castle openPGP library, check the below java code:
The below are the 4 methods you going to need:
The below method will read and import your secret key from .asc file:
public static PGPSecretKey readSecretKeyFromCol(InputStream in, long keyId) throws IOException, PGPException {
in = PGPUtil.getDecoderStream(in);
PGPSecretKeyRingCollection pgpSec = new PGPSecretKeyRingCollection(in, new BcKeyFingerprintCalculator());

PGPSecretKey key = pgpSec.getSecretKey(keyId);

if (key == null) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Can't find encryption key in key ring."");
}
return key;
}

The below method will read and import your public key from .asc file:
@SuppressWarnings(""rawtypes"")
public static PGPPublicKey readPublicKeyFromCol(InputStream in) throws IOException, PGPException {
    in = PGPUtil.getDecoderStream(in);
    PGPPublicKeyRingCollection pgpPub = new PGPPublicKeyRingCollection(in, new BcKeyFingerprintCalculator());
    PGPPublicKey key = null;
    Iterator rIt = pgpPub.getKeyRings();
    while (key == null && rIt.hasNext()) {
        PGPPublicKeyRing kRing = (PGPPublicKeyRing) rIt.next();
        Iterator kIt = kRing.getPublicKeys();
        while (key == null && kIt.hasNext()) {
            PGPPublicKey k = (PGPPublicKey) kIt.next();
            if (k.isEncryptionKey()) {
                key = k;
            }
        }
    }
    if (key == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Can't find encryption key in key ring."");
    }
    return key;
}

The below 2 methods to decrypt and encrypt gpg files:
public void decryptFile(InputStream in, InputStream secKeyIn, InputStream pubKeyIn, char[] pass) throws IOException, PGPException, InvalidCipherTextException {
    Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());

    PGPPublicKey pubKey = readPublicKeyFromCol(pubKeyIn);

    PGPSecretKey secKey = readSecretKeyFromCol(secKeyIn, pubKey.getKeyID());

    in = PGPUtil.getDecoderStream(in);

    JcaPGPObjectFactory pgpFact;


    PGPObjectFactory pgpF = new PGPObjectFactory(in, new BcKeyFingerprintCalculator());

    Object o = pgpF.nextObject();
    PGPEncryptedDataList encList;

    if (o instanceof PGPEncryptedDataList) {

        encList = (PGPEncryptedDataList) o;

    } else {

        encList = (PGPEncryptedDataList) pgpF.nextObject();

    }

    Iterator<PGPPublicKeyEncryptedData> itt = encList.getEncryptedDataObjects();
    PGPPrivateKey sKey = null;
    PGPPublicKeyEncryptedData encP = null;
    while (sKey == null && itt.hasNext()) {
        encP = itt.next();
        secKey = readSecretKeyFromCol(new FileInputStream(""PrivateKey.asc""), encP.getKeyID());
        sKey = secKey.extractPrivateKey(new BcPBESecretKeyDecryptorBuilder(new BcPGPDigestCalculatorProvider()).build(pass));
    }
    if (sKey == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Secret key for message not found."");
    }

    InputStream clear = encP.getDataStream(new BcPublicKeyDataDecryptorFactory(sKey));

    pgpFact = new JcaPGPObjectFactory(clear);

    PGPCompressedData c1 = (PGPCompressedData) pgpFact.nextObject();

    pgpFact = new JcaPGPObjectFactory(c1.getDataStream());

    PGPLiteralData ld = (PGPLiteralData) pgpFact.nextObject();
    ByteArrayOutputStream bOut = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

    InputStream inLd = ld.getDataStream();

    int ch;
    while ((ch = inLd.read()) >= 0) {
        bOut.write(ch);
    }

    //System.out.println(bOut.toString());

    bOut.writeTo(new FileOutputStream(ld.getFileName()));
    //return bOut;

}

public static void encryptFile(OutputStream out, String fileName, PGPPublicKey encKey) throws IOException, NoSuchProviderException, PGPException {
    Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());

    ByteArrayOutputStream bOut = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

    PGPCompressedDataGenerator comData = new PGPCompressedDataGenerator(PGPCompressedData.ZIP);

    PGPUtil.writeFileToLiteralData(comData.open(bOut), PGPLiteralData.BINARY, new File(fileName));

    comData.close();

    PGPEncryptedDataGenerator cPk = new PGPEncryptedDataGenerator(new BcPGPDataEncryptorBuilder(SymmetricKeyAlgorithmTags.TRIPLE_DES).setSecureRandom(new SecureRandom()));

    cPk.addMethod(new BcPublicKeyKeyEncryptionMethodGenerator(encKey));

    byte[] bytes = bOut.toByteArray();

    OutputStream cOut = cPk.open(out, bytes.length);

    cOut.write(bytes);

    cOut.close();

    out.close();
}

Now here is how to invoke/run the above:
try {
         decryptFile(new FileInputStream(""encryptedFile.gpg""), new FileInputStream(""PrivateKey.asc""), new FileInputStream(""PublicKey.asc""), ""yourKeyPassword"".toCharArray());

        PGPPublicKey pubKey = readPublicKeyFromCol(new FileInputStream(""PublicKey.asc""));

        encryptFile(new FileOutputStream(""encryptedFileOutput.gpg""), ""fileToEncrypt.txt"", pubKey);

","If file.PKCS7 represents a PKCS#7 SignedData blob (what gets produced from X509Certificate2(Collection).Export(X509ContentType.Pkcs7)) then there are two different ways of opening it:

new X509Certificate2(byte[])/new X509Certificate2(string)

The single certificate constructor will extract the signing certificate of the SignedData blob.  If this was just being exported as a collection of certs, but not signing anything, there is no such certificate, and so it fails with Cannot find the original signer. (Win 2012r2, other versions could map it to a different string)

X509Certificate2Collection::Import(byte[])/X509Certificate2Collection::Import(string)

The collection import will consume all of the ""extra"" certificates, ignoring the signing certificate.


So if it's really PKCS#7 you likely want the collection Import (instance) method.  If it isn't, you have some odd variable/field/property names.

","First of all, I hope that's not the RSA private key that you are going to use in production.
As regards to doing the encryption/decryption on JavaScript side, there are various libraries such as Standford's JSBN RSA Encryption library and ohdave.com's RSA in JavaScript utility for doing simple encryption/decryption, but your main concern with these tools and even your architecture is performance. I would not do RSA encryption with JavaScript unless it was absolutely necessary and there were no other workarounds.

Using code from that link looks very promising.  The only thing missing is the padding.  I typically use PKCS1.5 padding which is the default for OpenSSL RSA.
I know the answer to this question is very close.  I know the only thing holding back decryption is the pkcs1.5 padding on the encrypted openssl ciphertext.
I was surprised to see how little information is out there on this subject because there are many situations where you would need a server to encrypt something, sign something, etc, and have a client application verify, decrypt, etc with the public key.
I also extensively tried using the RSACryptoServiceProvider to verify hash's resulting from the encryption using OpenSSL.  For example, I would do a private key encryption using a SHA256 hash of the plaintext, then try to do a RSACryptoServiceProvider verify on that signature, and it does not work.  I think the way MS does this is non standard and there are perhaps special customization at work with that.
So, the alternative is this question, which is simply taking private key encrypted ciphertext and using C# to decrypt it, thus, verifying it's authenticity.  Hashes can be incorporated to make a simple signature verification system for data objects signed by the server and verified on the client.
I've looked through the PKCS1 RFC's, OpenSSL rsa source code, and other projects, I cannot get a solid answer on how to account for PKCS1 padding when doing my RSA Decrypt.   I cannot locate where in the OpenSSL source code they handle the PKCS1 padding, otherwise, I might have an answer by now.
Also, this is my first question, I know it's a duplicate of an unanswered question, so, what to do?  I googled that too, and found nothing.
The other thing I don't understand is why my decrypt method doesn't work.  Since padding is removed after decryption, my decrypted data should resemble plaintext, and it's not even close.  So, I'm almost sure that pkcs1 padding means that other things are happening, specifically, to the ciphertext which means that the ciphertext must be preprocessed prior to decryption to remove padding elements.
Perhaps simply filtering the ciphertext to remove padding elements is the simplest solution here...
Here is my Decrypt method:
    public static byte[] PublicDecryption(this RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa, byte[] cipherData)
    {
        if (cipherData == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(""cipherData"");

        BigInteger numEncData = new BigInteger(cipherData);

        RSAParameters rsaParams = rsa.ExportParameters(false);
        BigInteger Exponent = GetBig(rsaParams.Exponent);
        BigInteger Modulus = GetBig(rsaParams.Modulus);

        BigInteger decData = BigInteger.ModPow(numEncData, Exponent, Modulus);

        byte[] data = decData.ToByteArray();
        byte[] result = new byte[data.Length - 1];
        Array.Copy(data, result, result.Length);
        result = RemovePadding(result);
        Array.Reverse(result);
        return result;
    }

    private static byte[] RemovePadding(byte[] data)
    {
        byte[] results = new byte[data.Length - 4];
        Array.Copy(data, results, results.Length);
        return results;
    }

","The problem isn't with the padding. In fact, removing padding values from decrypted ciphertext is actually very simple. The problem was with the software at this location:
You can see the author found a solution using some code from here: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/security/PrivateEncryption.aspx
And with Microsoft's implementation of System.Numeric which simply cannot handle larger integers...
To fix the issue, I looked at previous releases of code on the codeproject site and ended up with this PublicDecrypt method.
    public static byte[] PublicDecryption(this RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa, byte[] cipherData)
    {
        if (cipherData == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(""cipherData"");

        BigInteger numEncData = new BigInteger(cipherData);
        RSAParameters rsaParams = rsa.ExportParameters(false);
        BigInteger Exponent = new BigInteger(rsaParams.Exponent);
        BigInteger Modulus = new BigInteger(rsaParams.Modulus);

        BigInteger decData2 = numEncData.modPow(Exponent, Modulus);
        byte[] data = decData2.getBytes();
        bool first = false;
        List<byte> bl = new List<byte>();
        for (int i = 0; i < data.Length; ++i)
        {
            if (!first && data[i] == 0x00)
            {
                first = true;
            }
            else if (first)
            {
                if (data[i] == 0x00)
                {
                    return bl.ToArray();
                }
                bl.Add(data[i]);
            }
        }
        if (bl.Count > 0)
            return bl.ToArray();
        return new byte[0];
    }

That will perfectly decrypt ciphertext created by openssl using the rsautl utility, or the Perl Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA private_encrypt method.
The other big change was dropping the Microsoft BitInteger library which simply didn't work.  I ended up using the one mentioned in the Code Project article , and found here:
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2728/C-BigInteger-Class
The key here is to set the maxintsize in the library to a value which is larger based on how big of a key size you are using.  For 4096 bit, a value of 500 worked fine (approx length of the modulus).
Here is the calling method:
            var encmsg3 = ""JIA7qtOrbBthptILxnurAeiQM3JzSoi5WiPCpZrIIqURKfVQMN1BrondF9kyNzbjTs1DaEKEuMBVwKExZe22yCvXXpm8pwcEGc9EHcVK2MPqNo89tIF8LJcaDqBMwLvxdaa/QgebtpmOVN/TIWfuiV8KR+Wn07KwsgV+3SALbNgbOIR3RtCx3IiQ3tZzybJb08+ZKwJEOT011uwvvGmtJskQgq9PC8kr1RPXMgaP6xMX7PHFJ8ORhkuWOFfCh+R4NhY1cItVhnRewKpIC2qVlpzUYRAgKIKdCXuZDqUQdIponR29eTovvLb0DvKQCLTf9WI1SzUm6pKRn0vLsQL7L3UYHWl43ISrTpDdp+3oclhgRF3uITR4WCvoljephbGc6Gelk5z3Vi6lN0oQaazJ7zIen+a/Ts7ZX3KKlwPl4/lAFRjdjoqu7u4IAK7O7u1Jf2xDiGw18C/eGt8UHl09zU4qQf9/u+7gtJ+10z2NERlLSaCDjVqslwmmxu81pG2gCv8LfpR4JlPaFfBZMGfGBihyGryWhJwizUXXo8wgdoYbHRXe8/gL19qro0ea5pA9aAhDjTpX1Zzbwu2rUU7j6wtwQtUDJOGXXCw1VOHsx6WXeW196RkqG72ucVIaSAlx5TFJv8cnj6werEx1Ung5456gth3gj19zHc8E/Mwcpsk="";
            byte[] enc = Convert.FromBase64String(encmsg3);
            var dec = rsa2.PublicDecryption(enc);
            Debug.Print(""PLAINTEXT: "" + Encoding.UTF8.GetString(dec));

The only last thing someone would need to completely replicate this would be getting the private key into openssl format so that they could pass the private and public keys back and forth between openssl and C#.
I used openssl.net, and created an RSA instance, and set all the variables using bignumbers.  Here's the code for that:
        RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();
        rsa.FromXmlString(Properties.Resources.RSAParameters);

        RSAParameters par = rsa.ExportParameters(true); // export the private key


        using (OpenSSL.Crypto.RSA rsaos = new OpenSSL.Crypto.RSA())
        using (BigNumber bnmod = BigNumber.FromArray(par.Modulus))
        using (BigNumber bnexp = BigNumber.FromArray(par.Exponent))
        using (BigNumber bnD = BigNumber.FromArray(par.D))
        using (BigNumber bnP = BigNumber.FromArray(par.P))
        using (BigNumber bnQ = BigNumber.FromArray(par.Q))
        using (BigNumber bnDmodP = BigNumber.FromArray(par.DP))
        using (BigNumber bnDmodQ = BigNumber.FromArray(par.DQ))
        using (BigNumber bnInverse = BigNumber.FromArray(par.InverseQ))
        {
            rsaos.PublicExponent = bnexp;
            rsaos.PublicModulus = bnmod;

            rsaos.IQmodP = bnInverse;
            rsaos.DmodP1 = bnDmodP;
            rsaos.DmodQ1 = bnDmodQ;
            rsaos.SecretPrimeFactorP = bnP;
            rsaos.SecretPrimeFactorQ = bnQ;
            rsaos.PrivateExponent = bnD;
            string privatekey = rsaos.PrivateKeyAsPEM;   
            string publickey = rsaos.PublicKeyAsPEM
        }

With that you can easily create an RSA key, export everything to OpenSSL, and encrypt/decrypt anything you want within reason. It is enough to handle private key encryption followed by public key decryption.
Cool.

"9893080","PyCrypto: Decrypt only with public key in file (no private+public key)","Hello everyone.
I am trying to play a bit with RSA public and private keys and encryption/decryption with PyCrypto and I have encountered and issue that seems kind of strange to me (it probably makes a lot of sense the way it's working now, but I don't know much about RSA asymmetric encryption and that's why it's puzzling me). It is the inability I have encountered to decrypt something having only the public key.
Here's the thing: I have a server and a client. I want the server to ""recognize"" and register the client and show it in a list of ""known devices"". The client will have the public key of the server and the server will have the public key of the client, so when the client communicates with the server, it will encrypt its data with his client's private key and with the server's public key. By doing this, only the proper server will be able to open the data (with its private key) and will be able to verify that the sender is actually the client that claims to be... well... or at least, that's what I think, because I'm pretty newbie in this asymmetric encryption. The idea is that when one of those clients wakes up, it will send its public key (encrypted with the server's public key, of course, but that's probably not relevant at this point... yet) saying ""Hey, I'm a new client and this is my public key. Register that key with my UUID"" and the server will obey, associating that public key with the client's UUID and use that key to decrypt data coming from that client. I just want to transmit the client's public key, keeping its private key secret, secret, secret (it's private, right?)
I am doing some tests with openssl and very simple Python scripts that use PyCrypto (actually, not even in a server/client architecture or anything... just trying to encrypt something with a private key and decrypt it with the public key)
First of all, I have created a public/private key set with:
openssl genrsa -out ~/myTestKey.pem -passout pass:""f00bar"" -des3 2048

Ok, first thing that puzzles me a bit... It generates only one file, with both the private and the public keys... Well... O'right... whatever. I can extract the public key with:
openssl rsa -pubout -in ~/myTestKey.pem -passin pass:""f00bar"" -out ~/myTestKey.pub

So I thought I had my couple of private (private+public, actually) and public keys in ~/myTestKey.pem and ~/myTestKey.pub respectively. Well... apparently I'm doing something wrong, because PyCrypto doesn't like this assembly. And I don't know why.
I have two very simple test scripts, ""encryptor.py"" and ""decryptor.py"". The ""encryptor.py"" should encrypt something with the private key, and ""decryptor.py"", decrypt it with the public key. I know... I'm a parangon of originality...
So, I encrypt the string ""Loren ipsum"" with my ""encryptor.py"" (with private key):
----------- encryptor.py ----------------
#!/usr/bin/python

from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

def encrypt(message):
    externKey=""/home/borrajax/myTestKey.pem""
    privatekey = open(externKey, ""r"")
    encryptor = RSA.importKey(privatekey, passphrase=""f00bar"")
    encriptedData=encryptor.encrypt(message, 0)
    file = open(""/tmp/cryptThingy.txt"", ""wb"")
    file.write(encriptedData[0])
    file.close()

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    encryptedThingy=encrypt(""Loren ipsum"")


And it works fine. Well... I suppose so, because in the file ""/tmp/cryptThingy.txt"" I get a lot of gibberish. It looks really, really encrypted to me.
But when I try to decrypt it using just the file that contains just the public key...
----------- decryptor.py ---------------
#!/usr/bin/python

from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

def decrypt():
    externKey=""/home/borrajax/myTestKey.pub""
    publickey = open(externKey, ""r"")
    decryptor = RSA.importKey(publickey, passphrase=""f00bar"")
    retval=None

    file = open(""/tmp/cryptThingy.txt"", ""rb"")
    retval = decryptor.decrypt(file.read())
    file.close()
    return retval


if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    decryptedThingy=decrypt()   
    print ""Decrypted: %s"" % decryptedThingy


... PyCrypto yells at me with a:
  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pycrypto-2.5-py2.7-linux-i686.egg/Crypto/PublicKey/RSA.py"", line 107, in _decrypt
    mp = self.key._decrypt(cp)
TypeError: Private key not available in this object

Yeah, of course it's not available! I extracted the public key! It took me 2 hours finding how to do it properly!! 
What am I missing? As I said, I'm pretty newbie in this public/private asymmetric key encryption so I might have a core ""conceptual error""... Any hint will be appreciated.
¡Thank you in advance!
","You have it the wrong way round, you encrypt with the public key, and decrypt with the private key.

The publicly available encrypting-key is widely distributed, while the private decrypting-key is known only to the recipient. Messages are encrypted with the recipient's public key and can be decrypted only with the corresponding private key.
  Source

The idea is that you give the sending side the public key (which anyone can have, so you can distribute it in the open) then you encrypt the data with it, then decrypt it on your end with your private key (which only you have). This way the data stays secure.
You can encrypt something with the private key as the private key contains the information required to make the public key, but it would be unusual to do so, as normally the person encrypting the data does not have the private key.

RSACrypto class : http://sebsauvage.net/paste/?83517f2b3db94d24#Sdu12/vXPuxa5AxO95FPgKSF6N40R2DzD6lwQkvroyE=
","OK, problem in RSACrypto. When you encrypt file, it creates every time new keypair (in encrypt). Just remove new keypair generation from encrypt, call newKeyPair direcly, when you need it. 
And that static variables does no good for multi-thread environment. 
I'll suggest to throw RSACrypto class, or rewrite it at least. I don't know why you so afraid of using byte[] type and why you need everything be BASE64 encoded. Code will a lot simple without additional encoding/decoding.
Here is working example (without RSACrypto), you can use it as template:
    File file = new File(""C:\\temp-ldi\\pubkey.txt"");
    FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(file);
    file.createNewFile();
    KeyPairGenerator generator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"");
    generator.initialize(2048, new SecureRandom());
    KeyPair keyPayr = generator.generateKeyPair();
    writer.write(new BASE64Encoder().encode(keyPayr.getPublic().getEncoded()));
    writer.flush();
    writer.close();
    file = new File(""C:\\temp-ldi\\privkey.txt"");
    writer = new FileWriter(file);
    file.createNewFile();
    writer.write(new BASE64Encoder().encode(keyPayr.getPrivate().getEncoded()));
    writer.flush();
    writer.close();


    File privfile = new File(""C:\\temp-ldi\\privkey.txt"");
    File pubfile = new File(""C:\\temp-ldi\\pubkey.txt"");

So, if the SAML request needs to be signed, SP must use its private key for it. Also, a certificate containing SP's public key should be given to the IdP to validate the signature.

","RSA, using PKCS1 padding, only lets you do do strings that are the length the key (in bytes) - 11. This isn't an OpenSSL or PHP restriction but rather an RSA restriction.
If you want to do longer strings using the openssl_* set of functions use openssl_seal and openssl_open. openssl_seal generates a random string, encrypts it with RSA and then encrypts the data you're actually trying to encrypt with RC4 using the previously mentioned random string as the key.
phpseclib, a pure PHP RSA implementation, takes a different approach. If you insist on encrypting a string larger than the RSA key it'll split that string into chunks that are the max size RSA can handle and then concatenate the results.
The phpseclib OpenSSL Interoperability page discusses how you can use phpseclib to do the same thing as openssl_seal / openssl_open.
Hope that helps!

","You can either:

Encrypt the data using a symmetric encryption method, using a random key that is then encrypted using the public key of an asymmetric encryption method (The random key, encrypted with the public key, is necessary to the user who decrypts the data.)
Encrypt the data using an asymmetric encryption method, after splitting the data in chunks of the size handled by the asymmetric encryption method

The first implements a hybrid cryptosystem. Using PHP and the openSSL extension you can use openssl_seal(), which (since PHP 5.3.0) allows to set the cipher method (by default, RC4) and (since PHP 7.0.0) the initialization vector. If you aren't using PHP 7.x, or you want to write code compatible with PHP 5.3.3 and higher versions, and you want to be able the initialization vector, you could 
use openssl_random_pseudo_bytes() to generate the random key, openssl_encrypt() to encrypt the data, and openssl_public_encrypt() to encrypt the random key.
I would not use openssl_seal() with a PHP version that doesn't allow me to set the cipher method (but then, I would not use that PHP version because it's not supported anymore), and I would not use RC4 as cipher method, on PHP versions that allows me to select the cipher method.

I imagine there is a way to do this with the PyCrypto library but I couldn't find any examples that use the exponent and modulus. 
Edit 1:
Using the solution below, it appears to be working. Since I'm using python 2.7 I modified it to look like this: 
from Crypto.PublicKey.RSA import construct
from binascii import unhexlify
from codecs import encode

e = long(10001)
n = int(encode('d0eeaf17801.....5d041817005535171', 'hex'), 16)

key = construct((n, e))
a = key.encrypt('hello', None)
print(a)

xaf\xa4\xc8I\xeeB\xdaP\x85\xa7',)

Now I want to convert this encrypted text to a string to send via a post request. But this doesn't seem to work:
a.decode('utf-8')

","With PyCrypto, you can use the Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.construct() function. You'll need to convert the modulus to an int. Here's an example (assuming big-endian):
from Crypto.PublicKey.RSA import construct

e = int('10001', 16)
n = int('d0eeaf...0b6602', 16)  #snipped for brevity
pubkey = construct((n, e))

Then you can do the usual things (like encrypt) with the key:
pubkey.encrypt(b'abcde', None)

Edit: Note that your public exponent, 10001, is mostly likely hexadecimal. This would correspond to the common public exponent 65537. I've updated the above to reflect that.

","So the issue actually relates to the data. PKI for php has a really small length restriction and can't be used to encrypt large amounts of data. Instead you're supposed to use PKI to encrypt a symmetric key which is then used to encrypt/decrypt data.

","First off, a so-called .pem file is not really a fixed specification or format. Several different kinds of distinct file formats are generally described as ""PEM"" files. When the SSLeay (now OpenSSL) project needed to produce a base64 encoded output file containing key information they borrowed formatting concepts from the old Privacy-Enhanced Mail RFCs 1421-1424 and they added the extension .pem to the end of these files. But such a file may contain public keys, private keys, certificate requests, certificates, certificate lists, and so on. Each is different. So if all you're told is to produce a .pem file you're going to have to guess what's really needed.
The easiest way to write such files is to use the Bouncycastle C# library. The package Org.BouncyCastle.OpenSsl contains a number of utilities including a PemWriter class that should help you.

RSACryptoServiceProvider privateRSAkey = Crypto.DecodeRsaPrivateKey(privateKeyStr);

to restore saved keys back to RSACryptoServiceProvider.

"10288521","Authentication with public/private key signatures: What's a good message (digest)?","I'm build an application with a client/server infrastructure and would like to implement an authentication mechanism using the public/private key method.
Let's assume that a client owns the private key and the server only has the public key. During authentication the client signs a message with the private key, sends it to the server where it's validated with the public key. If validation succeeds the client is authenticated.
Here's some JUnit test code where I made myself familiar with the concepts:
@Test
public void testSignature() throws Exception {
    final String message = ""Hello world is a stupid message to be signed"";

    final KeyPair keyPair = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"").generateKeyPair();

    final Signature privSig = Signature.getInstance(""SHA1withRSA"");

    privSig.initSign(keyPair.getPrivate());
    privSig.update(message.getBytes());

    byte[] signature = privSig.sign();

    final Signature pubSig = Signature.getInstance(""SHA1withRSA"");

    pubSig.initVerify(keyPair.getPublic());
    pubSig.update(message.getBytes());

    assertTrue(pubSig.verify(signature));
}

Of course in order for this to work both server and clients must be in possession of the plain message (digest).
Now my question is: What is a good message (digest) to be used for the signature? For example can this be a static, hardcoded string (which is used for all clients) or would this impose some kind of security issue on this concept? If a static string is bad would it be a good idea to negotiate some random string before authentication? This random string could be used as a ""session"" key for example and invalidated after some time.
","The static String would be bad since its susceptible to a repeat attack  (The signed string would be the same every time).  
Although, you seem to be reinventing what has been done before.  Using certificates is the trusted way.  See this example for more info on it: Java HTTPS client certificate authentication
If you want to implement it yourself you'll probably need to read up on how SSL works and mimic that.  Any other solution is likely to have some flaws in it, unless it was very bespoke (e.g. your client would keep a list of 1000's of shared static strings which it never reused, and the server had that same list and kept track of what had been used. or alternatively, keep track of a shared number which increments, as suggested in the comments below.)

","You could solve this by runlength encoding. Use a DataOutputStream to write an integer at the start that represents the amount of bytes that are written afterwards. When decrypting, read that integer, and only use the amount of bytes it says.
I noticed you are using the Cipher class in a wrong way. Use the update method to add bytes to cipher and only use doFinal once. It is important that you use this overloaded version of the update method. Set the inputOffset parameter to zero and the inputLen parameter to i. This will make sure, that the Cipher is only using the bytes it should.

","Your IO code for reading block by block is incorrect:
while ((i = fin1.read(block)) != -1) {
    byte[] inputfile= cipher.doFinal(block);

}


It assumes that every time you ask to read a block, a whole block is read. That is not necessarily the case. Only a few bytes might be read. The number of bytes that are actually read are returned by the read() method (and stored in i). You should not ignore it.
The last block has a pretty good chance of being incomplete, unless your file size is a multiple of 32. So at the last iteration, you're encrypting the last N remaining bytes of the file + the 32 - N bytes that were stored in the byte array at the previous iteration.

Using RSA to encrypt a large file is not a good idea. You could for example generate a random AES key, encrypt it using RSA and store it in the output file, and then encrypt the file itself with AES, which is much faster and doesn't have any problem with large inputs. The decryption would read the encrypted AES key, decrypt it, and then decrypt the rest of the file with AES.

","Hybrid Cryptosystem
Example: For a 1024 bit key, you can encrypt around 1024 / 8 = 128 bytes
Note: Exact value is 128 bytes - 11 bytes for padding
You can use a symmetric key to encrypt and decrypt the data (> 128 bytes) to be transferred. RSA can only encrypt data up to a certain extent (e.g. 128 bytes) which depends on the RSA key length.
This means that if you want to transfer anything bigger than 128 bytes, you have to transfer a symmetric key < 128 bytes first so you can have the following:


Generate a symmetric key (< 128 bytes)
Encrypt symmetric key with RSA
Transfer encrypted symmetric key
Decrypt symmetric key with RSA
Encrypt data (> 128 bytes) with symmetric key
Transfer encrypted data
Decrypt encrypted data with symmetric key


or (transfer encrypted symmetric key and encrypted data at the same time)


Generate a symmetric key (< 128 bytes)
Encrypt symmetric key with RSA
Encrypt data (> 128 bytes) with symmetric key
Transfer encrypted symmetric key & encrypted data
Decrypt symmetric key with RSA
Decrypt encrypted data with symmetric key

link

To validate the certificate to ensure it contains the information
  digitally signed by the certificate authority, the web browser
  verifies the digital signature. Because the digital signature is an
  encrypted hash value that was computed based on the contents of the
  certificate, the web browser needs to compare hash values. The web
  browser computes a hash value based on the contents of the certificate
  it received. It then decrypts the digital signature to determine the
  hash value that the certificate authority computed. If the two hash
  values match, the web browser is assured that the certificate contains
  the information that the certificate authority verified and digitally
  signed.

questions :

The web browser computes a hash value based on the contents of the
  certificate it received

The browser knows in which digest algorithm the certificate was used inside , so he uses it also to calculate a hash - based on the certificate content.

It then decrypts the digital signature to determine the hash value
  that the certificate authority computed

The browser knows which CA created the certificate , so he takes the public key from the appropriate computer store location and apply it on the encrypted hash value . the result is the decrypted hash value. 
It then see if both the same.
Am I right ?
","(You may be interested in this question on Security.SE.)
This is the structure of an X.509 certificate:

Certificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
     tbsCertificate       TBSCertificate,
     signatureAlgorithm   AlgorithmIdentifier,
     signatureValue       BIT STRING  }

TBSCertificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
     version         [0]  EXPLICIT Version DEFAULT v1,
     serialNumber         CertificateSerialNumber,
     signature            AlgorithmIdentifier,
     issuer               Name,
     validity             Validity,
     subject              Name,
     subjectPublicKeyInfo SubjectPublicKeyInfo,
     issuerUniqueID  [1]  IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL,
                          -- If present, version MUST be v2 or v3
     subjectUniqueID [2]  IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL,
                          -- If present, version MUST be v2 or v3
     extensions      [3]  EXPLICIT Extensions OPTIONAL
                          -- If present, version MUST be v3
     }


When presented with the certificate, the browser gets the signature algorithm from the certificate itself. Typically, this is something like RSAwithSHA1.
In this case, it can indeed recalculate the SHA-1 digest of the TBSCertificate (the actual content of the certificate).
In addition, from the TBSCertificate, it can find the issuer name: this is what's used to find a trust anchor from the known CA certificates (the issuer name must match the subject of the CA certificate). When it has found the CA certificate with the right name in the list it already trusts, it can get the public RSA key from that CA certificate.
Having both the SHA-1 digest and the RSA public key, it can verify that the signatureValue matches.

the digital signature is an encrypted hash value

That's not strictly true, although it's commonly said. Digital signatures are digital signatures, not encryption.
The problem is that RSA uses the same maths to encrypt and sign: encryption with the public key and signature with the private key. Often, one is confused with the other (even in the OpenSSL API). It doesn't make sense to ""encrypt"" with a private key, since ""encrypting"" implies hiding (and you're not hiding anything if you're giving the public key away so the it can ""decrypt"" the signature).
This subtly about hash and encryption with digital signatures wouldn't work with some other algorithms such as DSA, which are for signatures only.
This is why a number of digital signature APIs combine the hash and key usage into a single ""sign"" or ""verify"" operation. This is what the Java Signature API does, for example: you tell it to use RSAwithSHA1 or DSAwithSHA1, give it the key and the message, and tell it to sign or verify, you don't have to do the digest or ""encryption"" manually.
For the purpose of certificate verification: the browser gets the issuer from the cert and find the corresponding public key (from trusted CA certs), it also gets the signature algorithm from the cert, and then verifies the signature with that public key and the TBSCertificate content, according to what the signature algorithm dictates.

","Your algorithm is O(2^n), where n is the number of bits in the original number l. (that means that a single bit more will double the runtime, because twice as many numbers a must be checked - on average)
If 45 bits took 33 ms, then 1024 bits will take approx. 2^1024 / 2^45 * 33ms = 5.34654 * 10^285 years.
This of course assumes, that the 1024bit code is exactly as efficient as your code for long numbers (64bit?). Which is a bold statement, considering that 10^285 years is more than enough time to switch to the General number field sieve and scratch a few million years of that time...

In 2009 the 768 bit number rsa-768 was cracked using about 1000 cores and 2 years of calculations. Assuming they used the General number field sieve (a very fair assumption) it would take them 7481 years to crack a 1024 bit number using the same hardware.
Or using only your i7 with this algorithm: about 3 million years. Still a long time.... ;)

","Signing and encrypting are two entirely different concepts. It wouldn't make much sense to encrypt something with your private key and then distribute it to be encrypted with your public key. Your public key is inherently available, being that it is public, which defeats the purpose of encrypting. 
Traditionally, encryption is done with someone else's public key in a way that permits the message to be decrypted only with the private key. 
Signing, on the other, generally involves hashing the message using your private key as a seed value. Using the public key you hash the message again and compare your hash to the original hash. If they correspond (they won't be identical), then you have verified that the only possible sender is the holder of the private key (which may or may not be who you believe it is, if that has been compromised)

","Encrypting with the private key is not considered signing. Using RSA, there is in fact encryption using the private key, but this is just an implementation detail of RSA, and it is not encrypting the message, but a hash of the message, so no, verifying the signature does not bring back the original plaintext message.
Yes you can sign and verify signatures in OpenSSL -- cf. https://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/RSA_sign.html
No, you should not use ""textbook RSA"" with the modulus and exponent to roll your own encryption. Cf. here, for example: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1448/definition-of-textbook-rsa
No, you should not swap the use of the private and public keys by encrypting data with the private key and decrypting with the public. Cf. for example https://stackoverflow.com/a/2350959/233596.
UPDATE:
This page suggests that you can use the OpenSSL C interface to encrypt with the private key and decrypt with the public key, by way of these function prototypes:
 int RSA_public_encrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
    unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa, int padding);
 int RSA_private_decrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
    unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa, int padding);
 int RSA_private_encrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
    unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa,int padding);
 int RSA_public_decrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from, 
    unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa,int padding);

(I did not actually try using these functions.)
I tried using the openssl rsautl command line:
$ openssl rsautl -in HELLO -out HELLO.encrypt_by_private -inkey private.pem -encrypt

However:
$ openssl rsautl -in  HELLO.encrypt_by_private -pubin -inkey public.pem -decrypt
A private key is needed for this operation

So, I would say that the command line tool will not do it.

","In general you are required to perform hybrid encryption with ECC. ECIES for instance is basically a key agreement followed by symmetric encryption. So you cannot directly encrypt anything with ECIES, which is the most common ECC method for encryption. Basically you should couple it to a symmetric cipher. This is actually the best scheme for RSA encryption as well, most of the time.

As you can see you can use this directly as a Cipher using CBC mode & PKCS#7 padding, but beware of the large header (117 bytes for a 384 curve, no less). This is required to perform the key derivation. Make sure that the public key is properly validated (I'm not sure about the Bouncy Castle code in this regards, haven't taken a look at it).
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());

    KeyPairGenerator ecKeyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""EC"", BouncyCastleProvider.PROVIDER_NAME);
    ecKeyGen.initialize(new ECGenParameterSpec(""brainpoolP384r1""));

    // doesn't work, which means we are dancing on the leading edge :)
    // KeyPairGenerator ecKeyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""EC"");
    // ecKeyGen.initialize(new ECGenParameterSpec(""secp384r1""));

    KeyPair ecKeyPair = ecKeyGen.generateKeyPair();
    System.out.println(""What is slow?"");

    Cipher iesCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""ECIESwithAES"");
    iesCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, ecKeyPair.getPublic());

    byte[] ciphertext = iesCipher.doFinal(com.google.common.base.Strings.repeat(""owlstead"", 1000).getBytes());

    iesCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, ecKeyPair.getPrivate());
    byte[] plaintext = iesCipher.doFinal(ciphertext);

","The whole idea of public-key cryptography is that every 'user' has a 'Public key' and a 'Private key'. There are 3 main implementations for these keys: confidential, authenticated and combined.
In my answer, I'll go by the 'confidential' technique.
Each user has a 'Public key' that they distribute and which will be used by the other user to encrypt the message that will be sent back, and a 'Private key' that they keep only for themselves which is used to decrypt the messages that they will receive. 
The key that you have used to encrypt your message, isn't the same key that is used to decrypt.
Example of 'confedential key use':

Bob has: Bob private key, Bob public key, Alice public key
Alice has: Alice private key, Alice public key, Bob public key

Bob wants to send a message to Alice:
Bob uses 'Alice public key' to encrypt the message, sends it =>
Alice uses 'Alice private key' to decrypt the message.
Alice wants to reply and sends a message to Bob:
Alice uses 'Bob public key' to encrypt the message, sends it =>
Bob uses 'Bob private key' to decrypt the message.

Public key is only used to encrypt message
  Private key is only used to decrypt message encrypted with Public key

Now that you know what the basic idea of the 'Public key' and 'Private key' is, have a look at this image explaining the typical SSL communication and the use of the keys.

","In asymetric public/private key encripcion usually:

Bob generated his public/private key pair
Bob shared his public key 
Alice crypts some message with the public key of Bob
She sends the message 
Only Bob can decrypt with his private key. 


Using that aproach and the following code Alice can succesfully send a message to Bob
/**  BOB CODE  **/
$key = openssl_pkey_new(array('private_key_bits' => 2048));

$bob_key = openssl_pkey_get_details($key);
$bob_public_key = $bob_key['key'];

That's the basic infrastructure you had in your code and now is code that Bob executes. Bob generates the key pair and sends to Alice, in a real environment there must be a public key sharing mechanism.
When Alice gets Bob's public key, she cyphers her message with this key:
/** ALICE CODE **/
$alice_msg = ""Hi Bob, im sending you a private message"";
openssl_public_encrypt($alice_msg, $pvt_msg, $bob_public_key);

Finally Bob receives the message and decrypts it
/**  BOB CODE **/
openssl_private_decrypt( $pvt_msg, $bob_received_msg, $key);
print $bob_received_msg;

","Short Answer
A message encrypted by a public key can only be decrypted by the matching private key. 
Long Answer
Asymmetric encryption works both ways.
So why is there even an openssl_public_decrypt() function? you might ask. As the documentation states it can decrypt a message which has been encrypted by a private key. As wally mentioned before this can be used for signatures.
Let's say Alice waits for a message from Bob, but not from anybody else. So Bob uses his own private key to encrypt the message (e.g using openssl_private_encrypt()). When Alice recieves any message she tries to decrypt it using Bob's public key. If this succeeds she knows that the message came from Bob.
Note that encrypting using the private key would not be secure because anybody (who has access to the public key) can decrypt the message. In practise you would probably use a combination of both methods (append a signature encrypted with Bob's private key and then encrypt the entire message using Alice's public key).

"9599124","GnuPG/PGP and SSL: Sharing the same private key?","I'm trying to sort out my use of digital signatures and encryption. I understand that there are 2 main ways to do this: the PGP way and the SSL way.
What I would like to know if it's possible to use the same private key for both SSL certificate and GnuPG, providing that this is a RSA 2048 bit key.
I already have an SSL certificate signed by a CA, so I was hoping to use that certificate's private key as the GnuPG master private key.
I know that we can't make assertions between the SSL and GnuPG this way, but I would like to have only one private key (thus only having to protect one piece of data)
Thanks
","You can do this, but it's not necessarily good practice.
Firstly, when you say ""SSL certificate"", you probably mean ""X.509 certificate"". SSL/TLS uses X.509 certificates most of the time, but it can also use OpenPGP certificates (as far as I'm aware, only GnuTLS supports them).
Note that I'm also using the expression ""OpenPGP certificate"". Most people call them ""(Open)PGP public keys"", but they are in fact certificates: they're the combination of a public key, an identifier and some attributes, signed by other entities which attach their signature to it, so as to form the overall certificate. Strictly speaking, it's not just a public key.
The main difference between an X.509 certificate and a PGP certificate is that the X.509 can only have one signature (that of the issuer), whereas multiple signatures can be added onto a PGP certificate. (The PGP model can be used for a hierarchical PKI-like model, whereas the PKI model can't be used to handle the Web-of-Trust model.)
This Java code demonstrates how to ""convert"" a set of PGP keys into a self-signed X.509 certificate. In principle, you could also turn it into a CSR to get an X.509 certificate from CA. Whether it's a good idea to do so is a different matter.
Firstly, it's usually a good idea to re-generate new key-pairs once in a while. Typically, that's one of the reasons X.509 certificates used for SSL have an end of validity date (PGP signatures can also be limited in time).
You would also effectively put all your eggs in the same basket. If one of the key is compromised, both your X.509 and PGP certificates would be compromised.
More importantly, it's considered bad practice to re-use the same keys for signing and encryption: using them for two different applications (SSL/TLS and GnuPG) would only make the problem worse.

","The PKIX error means that the client didn't trust the server certificate, where the server in this case was the Registry. 
To clarify, you need two private keys and two keystores to hold them in, one each. You then need to create certificates in each keystore, export them, and import them into the peer's truststore. The server's truststore must trust the client's keystore, and vice versa.
Your code looks mostly OK. The result of createRegistry() should be stored in a static variable, to prevent it being GC'd. You don't need a serialVersionUID in the server class, whatever your IDE may tell you. It doesn't get serialized, at least not by RMI.
EDIT The problem is here:
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.keyStore"", ""C:\\ssl\\keystore-server.jks"");
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStore"", ""C:\\ssl\\truststore-client.jks"");

which should be:
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.keyStore"", ""C:\\ssl\\keystore-server.jks"");
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStore"", ""C:\\ssl\\truststore-server.jks"");

and here:
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.keyStore"", ""C:\\ssl\\keystore-client.jks"");
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStore"", ""C:\\ssl\\truststore-server.jks""

which should be:
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.keyStore"", ""C:\\ssl\\keystore-client.jks"");
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStore"", ""C:\\ssl\\truststore-client.jks""

EDIT 2 The underlying problem is that the trust store you need when binding to the Registry is the client truststore, but the truststore you need when running the server is the server truststore.
There are at least three possible solutions, in increasing order of merit:

Set up a subclass of SslRMIClientSocketFactory with its own SSLContext with its own TrustManager loaded from the client truststore, and override createSocket(). Ouch.
Import the server's certificate into the server's truststore as well.
Use the return value of createRegistry() to do the bind() instead of calling getRegistry() in the server at all, and avoid the whole problem.

"6886240","Python - Pycrypto - Sending encrypted data over network","I am trying to get 2 programs to share encrypted data over a network using public keys, but I am stuck with a difficult problem : the information that is shared (the keys and/or the encrypted data) seems to get modified. I am hoping to keep the encrypted data format as well as the format of the keys as simple as possible in order to allow compatibility with other languages.
To break down the problem, I have created 2 programs : Keyreceive and Keysend.
They execute in this order : 

Keyreceive starts up and waits to receive the encrypted data
Keysend starts up and generates an RSA key, saving the exported private key to a file
Keysend encrypts a piece of data and sends it to Keyreceive over the network
Keyreceive imports the private key from the same file, and uses it to decrypt the encrypted data
Keysend also decrypts the encrypted data to verify the result

Keysend.py
import socket
import os
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto import Random

rng = Random.new().read
RSAkey = RSA.generate(1024, rng) 

privatekey = RSAkey
publickey = RSAkey.publickey()
print(privatekey.exportKey()) #export under the 'PEM' format (I think)
print(publickey.exportKey())

file = open(""Keys.txt"", ""w"")
file.write(privatekey.exportKey()) #save exported private key
file.close()

data = ""hello world""
enc_data = publickey.encrypt(data, 16) #encrypt message with public key
print(str(enc_data))

host = ""localhost""
port = 12800
connexion = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
connexion.connect((host, port))
connexion.send(str(enc_data)) # send encrypted data, this appears to be the source of the problem

dec_data = RSAkey.decrypt(enc_data) # test decryption
print(dec_data)

os.system(""pause"")

Keyreceive.py
import socket
import os
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto import Random

host = ''
port = 12800

connexion = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
connexion.bind((host, port))
connexion.listen(5)
clientconnexion, connexioninfo = connexion.accept()
enc_data = clientconnexion.recv(1024) # receive encrypted data
print(enc_data)

file = open(""Keys.txt"", ""r"")
privatestr = file.read() # retrieve exported private key from file
file.close()
print(privatestr)

privatekey = RSA.importKey(privatestr) # import private key
data = privatekey.decrypt(enc_data) # decrypt sent encrypted data
print(data)

os.system(""pause"")

After both files have finished decrypting the encrypted data, Keysender outputs the original message : ""hello world"", whereas Keyreceiver outputs gibberish.
If there is ""hidden"" information in the encrypted data and key formats, would there be some way of writing them in a ""pure"" text format?
","You're right about which line is the source of the problem.
connexion.send(str(enc_data))

enc_data here is a tuple, the first (and in fact only) element of which is a string containing the actual ciphertext. When you are calling str on it, you're getting Python's attempt to convert the tuple to a string, which is not what you want. If you change it to this:
connexion.send(enc_data[0])

then it should do what you want.

","Encryption (providing confidentiality)

If you want to encrypt/decrypt in the same application, then you simple should swap the public key and the private key.
Encryption is always performed by the public key, decryption by the private key.
RSA does not have any security if you do it the other way around. 
If you know the private key then a public key with a small public exponent can be easily guessed by an attacker.

Signature generation (providing authenticity & integrity)

From the code however it seems you want to sign a message, but you are using an algorithm (RSA OAEP) that has been designed explicitly for encryption. 
Unfortunately both concepts are not compatible. First of all, OAEP padding mechanism is not compatible with the one for signing.

Furthermore, there may be differences in handling the keys 

the library will handle private keys operations differently from public key operations. - - Private keys require security, such as protection against side channel attacks.
Note that that a public key allows for a larger range of values than a private key (the public exponent may be small or large, the private exponent should always be near the key size). 

So the components of a private key will always match those of a public key. But as public keys normally have a small public exponent, public keys may not always be accepted as private keys.

The only good solution is to replace your own signing operation with the correct one. - -- Fortunately Python handles PSS signing operations, take a look at the documentation here, which helpfully contains sample code.

","Your problems are as follow:

Variable names $publickey and $publicKey are not equivalent.
$checksum=substr($step6,0,4); should be $checksum=substr($step6,0,8); because you need two hex chars to represent one byte.
$step8=$step4+$checksum; should be $step8=$step4.$checksum; 

Also, I don't know where your base58_encode() function comes from, but I hope it uses BCmath, because the number represented by 00ba084d3f143f2896809d3f1d7dffed472b39d8de7a39cf51 [step 8's result] is too large for PHP to handle internally.

Don't use base_convert() for numbers this large, it appears to be unreliable. I was writing the necessary bc_arb_decode() counterparts and found that the input and output were differing using base_convert() versus arb_convert($num, '0123456789abcdef'); and after comparing the results with Wolfram Alpha it seems that PHP is incorrectly converting the number.
Hex:           00ba084d3f143f2896809d3f1d7dffed472b39d8de7a39cf51
PHP's decode:  4561501878697786606686086062428080084446806606846864824262
Mine:          4561501878697784703577561586669353227270827349968709865297
Wolfram Alpha: 4561501878697784703577561586669353227270827349968709865297

You can see that PHP is way off. [1.9E42 aka 1.9 quintillion septillion] I've updated my code to include the arb_decode() functions which appear to do things correctly.

I mention the 'regular developer', because I had seen in the Android core code that Sony had added some code portions into it, in the DRM packages. Let's assume we're not that powerful to talk to Google to include such in their core code.
Are there any real secure ways to protect video/audio (as part of an app) on Android.
Assumptions (correct me if I'm wrong):

devices could be rooted by the users, need to be aware of that
detection whether a device is rooted or not (within an app) is not really possible on Android, as a super user can basically fake any state of the device.
we cannot modify any hardware or the user's system (meaning: we don't bundle our app product with a device, the app should be available as a 'regular' app on the App Market for download)
the media files/stream could be locally on the device or come remotely from a server, both is ok

I have researched this topic quite a bit, googled a lot, went through (hopefully) all related questions here on SO, I have talked to one DRM provider (which is really hard to get in touch with as a small company or freelance developer, or at least to get some real relevant information, technical docs and details). 
I looked into DRM as one approach, but ""security-by-obscurity"" does not seem to be a very good way. Besides, I haven't found any information or real solutions/APIs for regular developers.
Public-key encryption was another idea, but where to store the private key really safely? Furthermore, I assume that in such case, the entire media framework & player would need to be rewritten, in order to pass a secure video stream to the player. Or am I mistaken?
I would like to get some opinions from other experienced developers in the field, as it's really hard to find information about media content protection for Android anywhere.

"7625205","How to protect media content (video, audio) on Android from being saved/redistributed?","What opportunities are there for regular app developers (with that I mean, you're not a million dollar content producing company or distribution channel provider, but a regular, small app development company) to secure video/audio content for the app from being saved/distributed. 
I mention the 'regular developer', because I had seen in the Android core code that Sony had added some code portions into it, in the DRM packages. Let's assume we're not that powerful to talk to Google to include such in their core code.
Are there any real secure ways to protect video/audio (as part of an app) on Android.
Assumptions (correct me if I'm wrong):

devices could be rooted by the users, need to be aware of that
detection whether a device is rooted or not (within an app) is not really possible on Android, as a super user can basically fake any state of the device.
we cannot modify any hardware or the user's system (meaning: we don't bundle our app product with a device, the app should be available as a 'regular' app on the App Market for download)
the media files/stream could be locally on the device or come remotely from a server, both is ok

If by ""secure"", you mean ""fullproof"", then no. See Analog hole.

detection whether a device is rooted or not (within an app) is not really possible on Android

Nor is it possible anywhere. the laws of the universe make it impossible to detect such a thing, (okay, maybe you could exploit quantum physics for this, but even then I'm not sure) you can only add code to detect known techniques, all of which are trivial to bypass.

Public-key encryption was another idea, but where to store the private key really safely?

There is nowhere to store it safely. Think about it, you want to encrypt content and give the user the key to decrypt it (so he can watch it), but you don't want him to be able to decrypt it (so he can't copy it). This is a contradiction.
The most you can do is encrypt your stream to prevent the user from being able to just intercept it and use it. Then obfuscate the code that decodes/plays the stream. Though by implementing that you risk introducing more bugs (and worse performance), making the legitimate user's experience worse. If decide not to roll your own obfuscation, and use some automatic obfuscater product already available by some big company, it will already be generically cracked, and it will be extremely easy for someone who hardly knows what he's doing to crack your product in a small amount of time. As long as your product becomes remotely popular, one person is going to crack it and upload all the videos to torrent, then everyone will be able to pirate your product without doing any work.

","To convert the long base64-encoded public key you get from Google into one that you can use in PHP, try this:
$base64EncodedPublicKeyFromGoogle = ""...""; // This is the public key for your app you get from Google.

$openSslFriendlyKey = ""-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n"" . chunk_split($base64EncodedPublicKeyFromGoogle, 64, ""\n"") .  ""-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"";

Then you can pass that into openssl_get_publickey().
$publicKeyId = openssl_get_publickey($openSslFriendlyKey);

As you can see, the format from Google is almost the right kind. It just needs to be broken up into 64-character lines, and prepended/appended with the right header/footer.
You can also use the OpenSSL command to convert the public key like this:
openssl enc -base64 -d -in publickey.base64 -A | openssl rsa -inform DER -pubin > publickey.pem

Then you can read in the generated publickey.pem file with PHP and pass its contents to the openssl_get_publickey() function.

","If you can protect your private keys well enough, a middleman will not be able to masquerade as you, assuming the user actually looks at the certificate. The problem with self-signed is that if you want the user to add the exception to their browser, or just ignore the warning, then you are exposed to man-in-the-middle attack, because anyone else may create their own certificate.
Of course, ""protecting your private keys well enough"" is not trivial at all. When you pay for a ""Verisign"" certificate, you're not paying for their software creating the certificate - you're paying for the security forces they have guarding the building in which the private keys are stored.

","You can hard-code the server's certificate and compare it against what you receive. 
Or better yet, create a CA certificate and server certificate, signed by the CA. Have the CA trusted on the client (again by hardcoding it in your application) and validate received server certificate using the CA certificate.

","Yes. 
In short, a self signed certificate is more insecure than a CA certificate only when the client does not know the certificate in advance and therefore has no way to validate that the server is who it says it is. 
If you add the self signed certificate to the client and don't accept any other certificate, you're actually as secure (or, one could argue, even more so) than having a certificate authority signed certificate.
The important parts to keep SSL secure with or without a certificate authority are;

The server private key (and in the case of a CA, the private keys of all its roots) is kept secret.
The client knows the server certificate (or its CA root).

How can I convert the pfx file to a format that will be accepted by the following

","Certificate stuff is never simple . You need openssl (the Cygwin version works on Windows) to convert the pfx / p12 file to a pem file, then you can create a certificate from the pem. Finally, you can use the Java keytool program to convert the certificate to JKS format (the KeyStore default).
Convert the pfx to pem:
openssl pkcs12 -in whatever.pfx -out whatever.pem -clcerts -nokeys

Create an X509 certificate from the pem file:
openssl x509 -in whatever.pem -inform PEM -out whatever.crt -outform DER

Use Java's keytool to create a JKS file from the cert:
keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore whatever.jks -storepass somepassword -noprompt -file whatever.crt -alias localhost

Note the -alias can be whatever unique name you want to use for this cert. The convention is to use the URL of your web site.
Now, you should be able to load the JKS file with the KeyStore instance in your code. Maybe it's easier to just change your Java code to use a PKCS12 instance?

Why not?
The default keystore format for Java is JKS.  
But there are other formats and #PKCS12 is the most frequently used.  
If you need you application to be more ""robust"" I would recommend to not convert the file you have to the JKS format.  
Instead you can support more than the JKS and e.g. try the default keystore type and if it fails try the #PKCS12 
I would go further and suggest that the KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType()); is replaced by something like:  
KeyStore.getInstance(UserPreferences.getDefaultType()); 
where the user has chose which should be the default keystore file (could be #PKCS12)

","You are indeed reading file incorrectly. You are ignoring the return value of the InputStream.read(). You should call this method in cycle because the individual call is not guaranteed to read the entire byte array.
You can read it manually:
int offset = 0;
int read =  _fileStream.read(_contents, 0, contents.length);
while (read > 0) {
    offset += read;
    read = _fileStream.read(_contents, offset , contents.length - offset );

If I am right this is not the public key, but it is possible to get the public key from this string.
This answer gives answer to my question https://stackoverflow.com/a/19387517/2735398
But the answer doesn't seem to work. I get an exception:
java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException: java.security.InvalidKeyException: invalid key format

When looking at the comments of the answer I am not the only person with the problem...
How can I fix the exception? Or is there another way to get the public key from the string?
","I found a lot of answers how to get the public key - but none of them actually contained the part how to get the openssh public key as a string - it got a special format.
Cudos to @Jcs and @James K Polk
This depends on BouncyCastle. It could probably be done without.

"18856937","OpenPGP encryption with BouncyCastle","I have been trying to put together an in-memory public-key encryption infrastructure using OpenPGP via Bouncy Castle.  One of our vendors uses OpenPGP public key encryption to encrypt all their feeds, and requires us to do the same, so I'm stuck with the technology and the implementation.  So now I'm coding an OpenPGP encryption/ decryption toolkit for automating these feeds.
The examples at bouncycastle.org inexplicably default to writing encrypted data to and collecting keys from a file system; this is not what I want to do, so I've been trying to get everything stream-based.
I have gotten to the point where I can actually get my code to compile and run, but my encrypted payload is empty.  I think I'm missing something silly, but after several days of trying this and that, I have lost the ability to objectively examine this.
My utility class contains these methods:
    public static PgpPublicKey ImportPublicKey(
        this Stream publicIn)
    {
        var pubRings =
            new PgpPublicKeyRingBundle(PgpUtilities.GetDecoderStream(publicIn)).GetKeyRings().OfType<PgpPublicKeyRing>();
        var pubKeys = pubRings.SelectMany(x => x.GetPublicKeys().OfType<PgpPublicKey>());
        var pubKey = pubKeys.FirstOrDefault();
        return pubKey;
    }

    public static Stream Streamify(this string theString, Encoding encoding = null)
    {
        encoding = encoding ?? Encoding.UTF8;
        var stream = new MemoryStream(encoding.GetBytes(theString));
        return stream;
    }

    public static string Stringify(this Stream theStream,
                                   Encoding encoding = null)
    {
        encoding = encoding ?? Encoding.UTF8;
        using (var reader = new StreamReader(theStream, encoding))
        {
            return reader.ReadToEnd();
        }
    }

                if (read <= 0)
                    return ms.ToArray();
                ms.Write(buffer, 0, read);
            }
        }
    }

        outStream = encryptor.Open(outStream, data.Length);

    }

My test method looks like this:
    private static void EncryptMessage()
    {
        var pubKey = @""<public key text>"";

        var clearText = ""This is an encrypted message.  There are many like it but this one is cryptic."";
        using (var stream = pubKey.Streamify())
        {
            var key = stream.ImportPublicKey();
            using (var clearStream = clearText.Streamify())
            using (var cryptoStream = new MemoryStream())
            {
                clearStream.PgpEncrypt(cryptoStream,key);
                cryptoStream.Position = 0;
                Console.WriteLine(cryptoStream.Stringify());
                Console.WriteLine(""Press any key to continue."");
            }
        }
        Console.ReadKey();
    }

The result I get looks like this:

Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong?
","OK, I managed to get this working.  There were several problems with this implementation.  One problem was that certain things had to be done in order.  Here is what seems to need to happen:

The raw data needs to be put into a PgpLiteralData object
The literal data needs to be encrypted.
The encrypted data needs to be compressed.
The compressed data (optionally) needs to be armored.
The underlying streams need to be closed in order of usage.

There should be a more elegant way to do this, but the streams used by the BouncyCastle library are all frustratingly one-way, and at several points, I needed to convert the stream to a byte array to get another part to work.  I include the code I used and independently verified; if someone has a verifyably better way of doing this, I would be quite interested.

","When people encrypt their eMail, they just want the email to be transported over the web and to be stored on the target system as an encrypted data set which only the holder of the private key can read.
Signing the email is an additional feature which should identify the sender of the email. Traditionally a signature on paper is used in the western hemisphere which is easy to fake. Therefore an attestation of the signature was required for important documents. Digital Certificate Authorites for SMIME typically attest only that the requestor had access to a certain email address, which is probably worth nothing - certainly not 20 $/year.
For me it is perfectly OK to send my private key via email or exchange it on a memory stick. What's more important is to secure your private key when you really want secure communication. Typically everyone who can get access to your PC has also access to your private key! I'm using a smart card to generate and to store the private key. The key never leaves the card. However, you have to trust the smartcard. I do trust my card because it was developed by my team. This is certainly not an option lots of people have.

","In my opinion, using a self-signed CA is an absolutely valid option. Certificates issued by this CA and used for e-mail encryption work the same way as if they were issued from a globally trusted CA with the one exception that the end user must manually trust the CA once.
This means that the crucial step is to trust the self-signed CA. However, you can make sure that the self-signed CA is correct, this step is even safer than relying on a global trust company which you must trust but do not have the choice to.
For example, we publish our public CA certificate on the web, asking others who we would like to exchange encrypted mail with to download, import and trust it. It is easy to make sure that they did not get a forged certificate by checking the certificate's finger print with us. 
Once they have trusted our CA, encrypted e-mail exchange is no difference to using a commercial, ""professional"" (intermediate) certificate.

"6334141","How to establish a secure connection by using Synapse?","I'm testing Synapse and want to know how can I establish a secure connection. I noticed it supports SSL, but I'm not sure whether it suits my needs. I don't have a certificate from CA. I just want to encrypt all data between my server program and client program. Sure, I can encrypt the data myself before sending out. But if SSL can encrypt the data, maybe I can just use it. From what I know, SSL is for ""encryption"" and ""authentication"". What I need is only ""encryption"". Is it possible with Synapse? 
UPDATE:
Thanks for helping from daemon_x and the author of Synapse, Lukas Gebauer, I think I finally make it work. Here are what I did:
Server Side:
1) Uses ssl_openssl in your unit and put 'libeay32.dll' and 'ssleay32.dll' to the same directory of the exe file
2) After a connection is accepted, add following lines of code for the newly created socket.
fclient.SSLAcceptConnection;

Client side: 
1) Uses ssl_openssl in your unit and put 'libeay32.dll' and 'ssleay32.dll' to the same directory of the exe file
2) After connected to the server, add following line.
fclient.SSLDoConnect;

If no error occurred, the connection is secure now. But when you run your code, as said in document of Synapse, you may notice that the SSLAcceptConnection takes some time to return. So if you want to speed things up, you better create a certificate file and private key file upfront. And add following code before SSLAcceptConnection
  fclient.SSL.CertificateFile := 'bs-cert';
  fclient.SSL.PrivateKeyFile := 'bs-privatekey';

If you don't have a certificate and private key, please refer to ""CreateSelfSignedCert"" in ssl_openssl for getting a self-signed certificate and private key. You can save, by WriteStrToStream for example, FCertificate and FPrivatekey to files and use them later.
","Yes it is; you can use one of the plugins shipped with Synapse. As it's also mentioned there, the best is to use the ssl_openssl.pas. If you decide to follow this one you will need except Sysapse also the OpenSSL library. Author recommends OpenSSL 0.9.7 but as he said on our local forum it seems to works also with OpenSSL 1.0.0d.
Note if you are using D2009 up you will need a Unicode support which is not fully supported in version. Download the latest version instead.
The following sample code receives first 1024 bytes as a response to the HTTP GET method of a secured website using SSL encryption. I've used for it OpenSSL 0.9.8h with the latest version of Synapse. Note you need to put libssl32.dll and libeay32.dll from the OpenSSL package into your output directory to make it work properly. Let's have a form with a button and memo where we receive a result.
uses blcksock, synautil, synsock, ssl_openssl, ssl_openssl_lib;

procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
var Socket: TTCPBlockSocket;

begin
  Socket := TTCPBlockSocket.Create;

  try
    Socket.Connect('www.yousendit.com', '443'); // connect to the host
    Socket.SSLDoConnect; // start SSL connection; only server has a certificate

    if Socket.LastError = 0 then
      begin
        Socket.SendString('GET' + CRLF); // request GET method
        Memo1.Text := Socket.RecvBufferStr(1024, 1000); // receive 1024 bytes

","Here's how to inegrate with Nodejs.Crypto. First, the RSA private  and public keys need to be generated. There are several ways to do that, here's an a way to do this online with encrypt.JS. You can use getSignatureByInput function below after private and public keys have been stored into the filesystem which generates a unique signature given a string input:
const crypto = require('crypto')
const fs = require('fs')

const getSignatureByInput = (input) => {
  let privatePem = fs.readFileSync('PRIVATE_KEY_FILE_PATH_GOES_HERE')
  let key = privatePem.toString('ascii')
  let sign = crypto.createSign('RSA-SHA256')
  sign.update(input)
  let signature = sign.sign(key, 'hex')

  return signature
}

Thereafter, to verify a signature, you can use the following function:
const getSignatureVerifyResult = (input) => {
        let signatureSignedByPrivateKey = getSignatureByInput(input)

        let pem = fs.readFileSync('PUBLIC_KEY_FILE_PATH_GOES_HERE')
        let publicKey = pem.toString('ascii')
        const verifier = crypto.createVerify('RSA-SHA256')

        verifier.update(input, 'ascii')

        const publicKeyBuf = new Buffer(publicKey, 'ascii')
        const signatureBuf = new Buffer(signatureSignedByPrivateKey, 'hex')
        const result = verifier.verify(publicKeyBuf, signatureBuf)

        return result;
}

getSignatureVerifyResult will return true/false depending on whether the signature are verified. Keep in mind that there's a plethora of algorithms to choose when it comes to signing.

","Set git-shell as their login shell in /etc/passwd, as documented here. Doing this, you can have a single account dedicated to git access for you both.
The more complicated solution is to use something like gitolite to manage access to a collection of repos. I've used it and it's a bit of a pain to set up at first, but it works well and is currently maintained.
Alternatively, Bitbucket hosts unlimited private Git repos for free. You can both point your repos to Bitbucket as origin/master and collaborate there instead. This is what I do now.

"32117087","How to generate PublicKey object from a file in Java","I have a file containing a public RSA key (generated with ssh-keygen). I'd like to read the file and generate a PublicKey object.
Prior to that I converted the file, since reading the original files seems to be impossible:
# http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/220354/how-to-convert-public-key-from-pem-to-der-format/220356#220356
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -e -m PEM > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.pem
openssl rsa -RSAPublicKey_in -in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.pem -inform PEM -outform DER -out ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.der -RSAPublicKey_out

From Java - Encrypt String with existing public key file I defined the function readFileBytes:
public static byte[] readFileBytes(String filename) throws IOException {
    Path path = Paths.get(System.getProperty(""user.home"") + filename);
    return Files.readAllBytes(path);
}

Now I'd like to read the file and generate the PublicKey object, but I could not find a way to do that; java.security.spec.RSAPublicKeySpec does not provide a fitting constructor and java.security.spec.X509EncodedKeySpec throws an error java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException: java.security.InvalidKeyException: IOException: algid parse error, not a sequence:
//RSAPublicKeySpec publicSpec = new RSAPublicKeySpec(readFileBytes(""/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.der""));
// No fitting construktor

X509EncodedKeySpec publicSpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(readFileBytes(""/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.der""));
// Gives: ""algid parse error, not a sequence""

","I had a project in which (RSA) encryption was necessary, this is how I reconstructed the publicKey given the publicKey's byte array, that was just read from the file.
public PublicKey reconstruct_public_key(String algorithm, byte[] pub_key) {
    PublicKey public_key = null;

    try {
        KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(algorithm);
        EncodedKeySpec pub_key_spec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(pub_key);
        public_key = kf.generatePublic(pub_key_spec);
    } catch(NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
        System.out.println(""Could not reconstruct the public key, the given algorithm oculd not be found."");
    } catch(InvalidKeySpecException e) {
        System.out.println(""Could not reconstruct the public key"");
    }

    return public_key;
}

Then you could call the procedure similar to this call, reconstruct_public_key(""RSA"", readFileBytes(""path/to/your/publicKey/file""));
EDIT : I tried to do it myself (write the public key to a file, read that file and reconstruct the key). This works :
public static void main(String args[]) {
    String path = ""./pub_key_test.txt"";

    // Generate a keypair to write to file
    KeyPair kp = generate_key();
    PublicKey pub_key = kp.getPublic();
    File file = new File(path);

    try {
        // Write to file
        file.createNewFile();
        FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(path);

        out.write(pub_key.getEncoded()); // Write public key to the file
        out.close();

        // Read from file
        FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream(path);
        byte[] pub_key_arr = new byte[in.available()];
        in.read(pub_key_arr, 0, in.available());
        in.close();

        // Reconstruct public key
        PublicKey reconstructed_pub_key = reconstruct_public_key(""RSA"", pub_key_arr);
    } catch(IOException e) {
        System.out.println(""Could not open the file : "" + e.getStackTrace());
    }
}

And this is the generate_key procedure :
public KeyPair generate_key() {
    while(true) { // Else the compiler will complain that this procedure does not always return a ""KeyPair""
        try {
            final KeyPairGenerator key_generator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"");
            key_generator.initialize(2048); // Keys of 2048 bits (minimum key length for RSA keys) are safe enough (according to the slides 128bit keys > 16 years to brute force it)

            final KeyPair keys = key_generator.generateKeyPair();
            return keys;
        } catch(NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
            System.out.println(""The given encryption algorithm (RSA) does not exist. -- generate_key() - Cryptography."");
        }
    }
}

If you test this, you will see that the publicKey is reconstructed successfully.
EDIT : I tried doing it myself, using the ssh-keygen tool. This is what i did :

First I generated a RSA private key (.PEM format)
Outputted the public key portion to .DER format, so it can be used by Java.

This is how I did the conversion, which is a bit different of yours :
openssl rsa -in private_key_file.pem -pubout -outform DER -out java_readable_file.der

And I did the file reading like here, which doesn't differ much of yours. I tested this and Java successfully reconstructed the public key.

"4926126","RSA Encryption in Java: Cross Platform Issues?","The Situation
I'm working with RSA encryption in Java. I'm trying to encrypt data on an HTC Saphire (32B) developer phone equipped with Cyanogenmod's Android 2.2 and then decrypt said data on a 64 bit server running Mandriva Linux 2010. I am using the same public key, private key pair on both machines, can correctly encrypt/decrypt data on the Android phone, can correctly encrypt/decrypt data on the Linux server, but I am unable to encrypt data on the phone and then decrypt it on the server. I get bad padding exceptions. I have confirmed that the data is being sent correctly by the phone and is being parsed correctly by the server. As such, I cannot figure out why decryption fails. Can anyone help me with this? Perhaps the RSA algorithm in Java has some underlying assumption about word size?
Further information:

My encryption/decryption library is based on the guide found here.
My encryption key is 2048 bits in length, but I see similar behaviour with different key sizes.
I have packaged my RSA encryption/decryption code into a jar file. It was compiled through Eclipse on the server's machine.
The program using the encryption library on the Android phone uses the above library. It too was built using Eclipse.
The server program was built using Netbeans (as it was easier at the time to do so).

Other Questions

Are there other free public-key encryption algorithms / libraries available for Java? Do they work cross-platform? What performance would one expect from them? Etc., etc. I've looked into this and haven't found much; perhaps I'm looking with the wrong keywords.

Phew! I think that's it. Thanks for your help in  advance!

","RSA encryption (or any encryption algorithm) should work regardless of environment.  However, it is possible that certain systems make different assumptions about default padding and the mode of operation.  Make sure that when you are performing encryption and decryption that you fully specify not only the algorithm, but also the mode of operation (CBC, etc) and the padding.  If that doesn't work, I suggest posting your code from both the device and the server so we can examine it more closely.
Edit To address your question, in Java, when you get a cipher from the crypto package, you usually do so with the following code:
Cipher cipher;
cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");

The string provided to getInstance instructs the runtime to get a cipher instance that will use the AES algorithm, the cipher block chaining mode of operation and the PKCS5 Padding.  There are a number of supported algorithms and paddings.  I would check out this document from Oracle for more information about encryption in Java.
To be more specific, the string you use to request a cipher is in the format
<algorithm>/<mode of operation>/<padding>

To make matters worse, despite Java providing a number of algorithms, modes of operation and paddings, not all of them will work together.  You will need to read the documentation to find a configuration string that will work.

","The scenario you describe does indeed not provide authenticity. So both Alice and Bob cannot be certain that they are talking to each other. The scenario does only provide confidentiality and as such also not secrecy. 
Bob would have to manually confirm with Alice that the public key he thinks is Alice's public key is indeed hers (by calling her and reading it out load and confirming by her voice that it is Alice).
This problem is normally solved with a trusted third party (a Certificate Authority for example, like VeriSign) that issues certificates stating the e.g. Alice is indeed the owner of this particular public key. This is the way it is solved in modern browsers and this is the way all SSL sessions (with your bank of choice) work. A certificate authority signs the certificate from your bank (stating that your bank is indeed the owner of the public key the certificate contains) and your browser has an already built-in certificate from the certificate authority (building a chain of certificates that can be verified).
The scenario you describe is vulnerable to a so called MITM (Man-in-the-middle) attack and not solvable purely with public-key-encryption.

","What you are talking about very very very loosely looks like another implementation of an Asymmetric Encryption Algorithm found in the .Net framework.
.Net employs two branches for Asymmetric Encryption !!!

RSA ** Grand Mac daddy used for all asymmetric enc' purposes.
DSA ** more related to using and creating digital signature to verify an author.

Both are Abstract
Both are very similar to one another as to how they work and how a developer implements them but underneath I have read that two very different algorithms exist.
You are talking option 2.
.Net provides a class called DSACryptoServiceProvider which allows you tag your data with a value that is commonly referred to as signature.
According to a MS official course textbook heres roughly how it works.
Data >>> Hash Alg >>> Hash Value >>>>>>>>> Asymm' Alg >>>> Signature
                      Sender's PVT.KEY >>> 
Below shows how Bob can check to see if Alice is indeed the sender.
Data >>> Hash Alg >>> Hash Value || Decrypted Signature <<< Asymm' Alg <<< Signature
                                                                       <<< Sender's PUB.KEY
                          ?      ==      ?
As you can see Bob has to compare the generated Hash and Decrypted Signature
in order to verify that Alice is the sender. The DSACrypto' class has 4 methods that 
can be used here but only two are effective contextually speaking. At this point in time, this is all Bob can do, if his public key is not alice's public key, then essentially the software application should stop Bob dead in his tracks from proceeding any further as bob is trying to use a bogus public key when trying to communicate with Alice. This is the imposed relationship and stressed importance of the public key. The signature allows you verify the public keys owner. 
Here why? ::
If Bob has Alice's public key then he can use the same algorithm again to decrypt the encrypted data using the .VerifyHash or VerifyData methods. Should be straight forward what they do given this context. This is all done ofc using the Alice's Public Key. Only Alice can use the SignHash and SignData methods as they require Alice's Private Key.
As you can see above, a certain level of functionality is encapsulated already inside the DSA and RSA CryptoServiceProvider classes. It boils down to how well you implement them to verify Alice's as the sender everytime as the DSA algorithm allows you to certify a sender by matching the generated output. A certain signature and hash should match, if they do then in essence DSA has granted you a certain level of confidentiality between Bob and Alice.

","Sounds like your friend didn't encrypt the message to your public key in the first place.  That error message just means that you did not possess the secret key for any of the keys the message was encrypted to.

"1058793","How to Verify Signature, Loading PUBLIC KEY From PEM file?","I'm posting this in the hope it saves somebody else the hours I lost on this really stupid problem involving converting formats of public keys. If anybody sees a simpler solution or a problem, please let me know!
The eCommerce system I'm using sends me some data along with a signature. They also give me their public key in .pem format. The .pem file looks like this:
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDe+hkicNP7ROHUssGNtHwiT2Ew
HFrSk/qwrcq8v5metRtTTFPE/nmzSkRnTs3GMpi57rBdxBBJW5W9cpNyGUh0jNXc
VrOSClpD5Ri2hER/GcNrxVRP7RlWOqB1C03q4QYmwjHZ+zlM4OUhCCAtSWflB4wC
Ka1g88CjFwRw/PB9kwIDAQAB
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
Here's the magic code to turn the above into an ""RSACryptoServiceProvider"" which is capable of verifying the signature. Uses the BouncyCastle library, since .NET apparently (and appallingly cannot do it without some major headaches involving certificate files):
RSACryptoServiceProvider thingee;

using (var reader = File.OpenText(@""c:\pemfile.pem""))
{
    var x = new PemReader(reader);
    var y = (RsaKeyParameters)x.ReadObject();

    thingee = (RSACryptoServiceProvider)RSACryptoServiceProvider.Create();
    var pa = new RSAParameters();
    pa.Modulus = y.Modulus.ToByteArray();
    pa.Exponent = y.Exponent.ToByteArray();
    thingee.ImportParameters(pa);
}

And then the code to actually verify the signature:
var signature = ... //reads from the packet sent by the eCommerce system
var data = ... //reads from the packet sent by the eCommerce system
var sha = new SHA1CryptoServiceProvider();
byte[] hash = sha.ComputeHash(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(data));
byte[] bSignature = Convert.FromBase64String(signature);

///Verify signature, FINALLY:
var hasValidSig = thingee.VerifyHash(hash, CryptoConfig.MapNameToOID(""SHA1""), bSignature);

","Potential problem: using Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(data) is almost certainly the wrong way to get the hash. That means they can only send a hash which doesn't have any high bits set.
If this is in a ""packet"" you should get the raw data from the packet as a byte array. If it is represented as text, it should be in some encoded form - e.g. hex or base64. What does the hash look like?

Trying to emulate this locally the following is being done:

remove GnuPG home directory
access smart card to re-generate GnuPG home directory

The issue is that I cannot test encrypting a file after the above steps have been performed as the public key seems to be missing.  fetch doesn't seem to work.
At this stage I do not want to share the public key on any online server.

"46689885","How to get public key from an OpenPGP smart card without using key servers?","I am working on a use-case where OpenPGP is being used to generate a public key pair on a smart card (Yubikey).
The smart card is then to be shipped off to the user.
Trying to emulate this locally the following is being done:

generate keys on smart card
remove GnuPG home directory
access smart card to re-generate GnuPG home directory

The issue is that I cannot test encrypting a file after the above steps have been performed as the public key seems to be missing.  fetch doesn't seem to work.
At this stage I do not want to share the public key on any online server.
Is there any way of retrieving the public key from the smart card after deleting the key rings?
Below are the steps being followed:

"12192116","RSA - bitlength of p and q","I'm just trying to understand the key generation part of RSA, and more specifically, selecting the p and q primes. Given a target bit length for the modulus, n, what range I should be generating p and q in?
The modulus, n, is the product of p and q, where p and q are both prime numbers. I've read that p and q should be relatively close to each other, and somewhere around sqrt(n). If the target bit length is, for example, 32 bits (very small I realise), then does that follow that p and q should be a random prime of a maximum 16 bits?
Thanks for any clarification
Rob
","For a 32-bit modulus the question is a bit academic:  your primary aim in choosing p and q is to make the product hard to factorize, but finding the prime factorisation of a number smaller than 2^32 is so easy that there's little point worrying about the sizes of p and q in this case.  Note that the mathematics will work just fine so long as p and q are distinct primes.
For something more realistic, like a 1024-bit modulus, then yes, you're pretty safe choosing two 512-bit primes p and q at random:  that is, choose p and q uniformly from the set of all primes in the range [2^511, 2^512].  There's a notion of 'strong primes', which are primes designed to avoid particular possible known attacks---for example, you'll see recommendations that p and q should be chosen so that p-1 and q-1 have large factors, to guard against easy factorizations using Pollard's 'p-1' algorithm.  However, these recommendations don't really apply to large moduli and state-of-the-art factorization algorithms (GNFS, ECM).  There are other possible cases that in theory could give an easy factorization, but they're so unlikely to turn up in practice from random choices of p and q that they're not worth worrying about.
Summary: just choose two random primes with equal bitlength, and you're done.
A couple of additional comments and things to think about:

Of course, if you do choose two 512-bit primes, you'll end up with either a 1023-bit or a 1024-bit modulus;  that's probably not worth worrying about, but if you really cared about getting exactly a 1024-bit modulus you could either restrict the range of p and q further, say to [1.5 * 2^511, 2^512], or just throw out any 1023-bit modulus and try again.
Don't deliberately choose p and q so that they're near each other:  if p and q are truly close to each other (e.g., less than 10^10 apart, say), then their product pq is easily factorized by Fermat's method.  But if you're choosing random primes p and q in the range [2^511, 2^512], this isn't going to happen with any sort of realistic probability.
When choosing a prime at random, a tempting strategy is to pick a random (odd) integer in the range [2^511, 2^512] and then increment it until you find the first prime.  But note that that does not give a uniform choice amongst all primes:  primes occurring after a large gap would be more likely to come up than other primes.  A better strategy is just to keep picking random odd numbers and keep the first one that's a prime (or more likely, a strong probable prime to so many randomly-chosen bases that you can be sure in practice that it's prime).
Make sure you've got a really good cryptographic source of random numbers on hand for your prime number generation.

I have looked at the following post, yet I dont understand how to use AES in javascript without having the AES passphrase compromised.
RSA Encryption Problem [Size of payload data]
","Without generating a symmetric key and encrypting the full message? Use a bigger key. 1024-bit keys can only encrypt 117 bytes without some sort of padding, but a 2048-bit one can handle up to 245 bytes, and a 4096-bit key up to 501 bytes. That could make your script handle bigger and accented names (non-ASCII characters uses two or more bytes per character).
I ended up with a similar problem, but Thoman Pornin answer to RSA Encryption Problem [Size of payload data] was great in explaining the reason of this limitation.
Also gave up trying to split up the message in several encrypted chunks after reading (the same) Thomas Pornin answer to Does RSA padding have to be unpredictable if the payload is?

This is what I plan to do:-

While signing up, user's public key is saved in the website.
When the user tries to login later, the website asks the user for his corresponding private key.
User is authenticated if the private key matches the public key which the user provided while signing up.

I have seen sites like startssl.com asking for user's private key to verify their identity (see the screenshot attached). So what does it takes to implement such a system?

","Just to clarify the flow

The user signs up, using the plain old username and password pair. He is also asked to enter at least one public key (other ones can be added later from a profile administration panel)
The server stores the user's public key and associates it with its user in a certificate
Next time the client makes a request presenting his certificate (this should be handled by the browser, thus happening transparently to the user), the SSL engine on the server side checks if it knows the client and if it does the request is processed and the application code will authenticate and authorize the user since it knows the link between a public key and an user. If the client is not identified, the server should redirect to some page to allow signin up or manual login (maybe to add a new public key)

I do know that the version of OpenSSL on 5.3.5 is 0.9.8 whereas the version in 5.3.8 is 1.0.0. I imagine that there might be a problem there. Is there any way to work around that?
I have tried to find out as much as I can from the OpenSSL.org site, and the PHP bug tracker, but I don't know what I'm looking for.
Regards,
Philip

","OpenSSL is a very good package. You can just use the crypto library portion, which provides basic RSA implementations. That might be in line with what you are looking for.
Cryptlib is another alternative that could work for you. It has some strange licensing issues though, so consider those depending on how you will be using it.
Crypto++ is a set of different crypto technologies, and includes RSA, so you might try that.
Finally, RSA is not terribly complex to implement, so you could even implement it yourself using GMP, which provides the necessary mathematical functions you would need.

","The answers on this question contain some interesting links to other libraries.
However, I remember that there exists some reference source code in C for RSA and private key cryptography. I will add a link as soon as I have found it ;-)
EDIT
I just found ""this link"" (http://www.hackchina.com/en/cont/93068 - open on your own risk) - not sure about the source and details of that code. But, however, in the past the link to the original RSA reference implementation was contained somewhere in OpenSSL source or its documentation. Which is based on cryptsoft.com's library. I am sure the source can still be found somewhere on www.rsa.com/rsalabs/ - but I could not find it, and I am running out of time for now. Good luck ;-)

","DJ Bernstein's curve25519 lets you create public/private key pairs. It does not have functions for signing, but you should be able to figure that part out with not too much hassle.
Update: In the mean time, there's also Ed25519 which already has the signature generation stuff figured out, without you having to jump through hoops. Same author, same availability of software (also e.g. ""Donna"" implementation and python binding), same ease of use, comparable speed.
The original implementation as well as the ""Donna"" implementation are both available under very liberal licenses.
You need to compile one file and call exactly one function to generate a key pair, and it's very fast. No obscure requirements for the public key. All one ever needs for some ""cheap, fast, easy public key crypto"".

Might be worthwhile if you change your tags up a bit to include bouncycastle and phpseclib. I'd add those tags but some tags will have to be removed since you're already at the limit of 5. I'll let you decide which ones to remove (if you even want to do that).

","I did some digging into the classes you're using and it seems like what you've posted has most of the default parameters matching your explicit parameters. However, this doesn't ensure that your configuration has those all set to match the current documentation if you're using older implementations.
Also, a tip from a senior Facebook security engineer who discussed a similar issue in a lecture recently; different libraries implementing the same security protocols will oftentimes be incompatible and even the same libraries in different environments or languages will oftentimes fail to work together. With that in mind, a few things to try given that working examples similar to your setup exist online:
Make sure you're using the latest versions of libraries. Also note that some javax functions and classes are deprecated and suggest using java.security now (didn't check if this applies to your case).
Force the key size to be consistent (1024 or 2048). The java implementation can do either and I didn't find consistent documentation for both libraries saying what your configuration default would be used (could be causing problem #2, though you might get a different exception for invalid key size).
Ensure that your privatekey matches expectation (length/reads the same between java and php).
Force default values to be explicitly defined (set CryptRSA hash to sha1, key lengths, anything else you can explicitly set).
Try encrypting the same message with both java and php to see if you can get the same outputs. Do this after ensuring your keys read the same and don't throw exceptions while being used in both applications. Encrypting a single character can tell you if the same padding scheme is actually being used (it appears from the source code that both use MGF1, but it never hurts to check outputs).
Finally try taking an example for php to java encryption which is said to already work and do one change at a time until you get back to your current encryption scheme. I saw a few examples googling quickly which used different parameters and settings with CryptRSA and java security that stated they were working together. Take a working example and try swapping the hash function and then the encryption, etc.

","Assuming you're using a valid RSA key, you'll need to:

Convert your public key from a string to an actual public key object

KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
byte[] keyBytes = Base64().getDecoder.decode(publicKey.getBytes()); //assuming base64 encoded key

Encode to a readable format. 

Check out this answer for steps 1-3: RSA Encrypt/Decrypt in Java. Remember to use the correct algorithm spec, in your case PKCS1
Chances are your cipher text will not use only UTF-8 characters so you'll probably want to use Base 64 encoded text to display your cipher text. Base 64 is able to display all those wonky characters as ascii values.
Simply use: Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(cipherTextBytes)

"36869631","DHGEX failing with 2048-bit key under Java 8, but succeeding with 1024-bit key","I'm using JSCH 0.1.53 to connect to a remote SSH server, which uses a 1024-bit RSA key.  We are able to connect successfully to the remote server when we also use a 1024-bit RSA key, but when we generated stronger 2048-bit keys we stopped being able to connect.  We got an error message that reads ""prime size must be multiple of 64, and can only range from 512 to 2048"" and that originates from a call to DHGEX.java (Diffie-Hellman Group EXchange).
We're running Java 1.8, and the error message correctly specifies a max bit size of 2048, so the problem is not the JCE key limitation of 1024 bits in Java 1.6 and 1.7.  And we've confirmed that both our private and our public key are in fact 2048 bits, via openssl rsa -text -noout -in id_rsa and ssh-keygen -lf id_rsa.pub.
Since everything looked fine on our end, I started adding debugging lines to the JSCH code and recompiling the JAR, and I was eventually able to determine that the modulus being passed to us during the key exchange was in fact 2047 bits long.  Now, 2047 bits in length doesn't inherently mean that you didn't generate a 2048-bit key or that it's any less strong than a key that actually contains 2048 bits, it just means that you happened to get two primes that multiplied together to something whose first bit was a 0. So it's expected behavior (some of the time) and the JCE check should probably be (n % 64 == 0 || n % 64 == 63).  But JCE is a stickler on the point, so it rejects this key for not being of a length it considers valid.
Based on that, I thought I'd found the problem: the remote server had generated a 2048-bit key that only contained 2047 bits, so they just needed to generate a new one (and keep doing it till they got one that really was 2048 bits).  But when I asked their administrators about it, they were insistent that they were using a 1024-bit key, and indeed that's what you get in the known_hosts file when you SSH over.  So that doesn't appear to be the cause after all.
So I started logging the contents of the buffer that contained what they sent us and pulling out the p and g values (modulus and group), and I discovered that in just a few short periods of testing over a couple of days, there were 33 different modulus values, and all of them differed by only the last few characters when encoded in either base 64 or base 10.  Modulii values were reused, sometimes only once and sometimes a dozen times, but there were lots of distinct values, so the keys are neither generated for one-time use nor generated once and reused forever.
Is this (having the server send many different keys that are very close numerically, with some reuse but many unique values) expected behavior under any conditions, and especially is this expected behavior when the client uses a 2048-bit key but the server uses a 1024-bit key?  I know nothing about Diffie-Hellman group exchange besides what I've read since I started investigating last week, so maybe this is just how it works, but it seems strange to me.
Also, does the SSH standard specify anything about how keys should be generated in cases like these?  I haven't yet found out what SSH server the far side is using (I suspect OpenSSH, but don't know for sure and don't know what version), but I'm hopeful that there might be some standard that forces the use of keys that are of the same size as was requested (between 1^(n-1) and 1^n - 1), and that the remote server might have an option to force this or that I can submit a bug against them to get them to change the behavior.  I'll probably also submit a bug against the JDK to allow keys of n-1 bits, with 0-padding for the first bit.
Any guidance that anyone can give would be greatly appreciated.
I've also posted this question to the JSCH mailing list: https://sourceforge.net/p/jsch/mailman/message/35042955/
UPDATE:
After further reading, I believe that Diffie-Hellman's forward secrecy characteristic means that different primes (often from a pre-generated set stored somewhere like /etc/ssl/moduli) would be used for each session (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange#Forward_secrecy) and that the prime used is not actually the RSA key (source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23346185/1247705), so the fact that many different p values are seen no longer seems like a concern.  I'm still surprised that they're so close in value, but maybe that's expected as well.
The far side is using Solaris SSH 1.1.4 (which as I understand it is based on OpenSSH) as the SSH daemon.  Is it expected that that daemon would pass 2047-bit primes as part of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and is there anything that can be done to get it to send 2048-bit primes instead?

","I ended up working around this issue by disabling the key-exchange algorithms that used a variant of Diffie-Hellman Group key exchange.  @Brian Low appears to have worked around it by using BouncyCastle instead of the JDK's built-in security provider.
I consider both of those to be workarounds that don't solve the underlying problem (which appears to be a bug in either the JDK for what key sizes they accept or in OpenSSH for what key sizes they generate), but neither I nor my project cared enough to spend time and money trying to force one or the other to take ownership of the issue.

","By default, keys aren't exportable - they are securely stored in the KSP. When creating the key, it needs to be marked allowed for export. Example:
var ecdh = new ECDiffieHellmanCng(CngKey.Create(CngAlgorithm.ECDiffieHellmanP256, null, new CngKeyCreationParameters {ExportPolicy = CngExportPolicies.AllowPlaintextExport}));
//Export the keys
var privateKey = ecdh.Key.Export(CngKeyBlobFormat.EccPrivateBlob);

To make this simpler, we can just export it from the CngKey directly and not use the algorithm if all you want to do is create a new key and export the private key.
var cngKey = CngKey.Create(CngAlgorithm.ECDiffieHellmanP256, null, new CngKeyCreationParameters {ExportPolicy = CngExportPolicies.AllowPlaintextExport});
var privateKey = cngKey.Export(CngKeyBlobFormat.EccPrivateBlob);

You can re-create the CngKey from the exported blob by using CngKey.Import(yourBlob, CngKeyBlobFormat.EccPrivateBlob) and passing that to the constructor of ECDiffieHellmanCng.

SecuritySafeCriticalAttribute is part of the .NET Security Transparency model. It is not the source of your errors.

But I cannot figure out how to export the key so I can send it to my server for use there. 
From my understanding. A SecKey is stored in Keychain and is a pointer to it, the block size is the length of the key in the memory. So in theory I can extract it as NSData and then convert it to something my server can read. In theory I think that will work, I've hit a wall trying to do that in practice. All help will be greatly appreciated.
","SecItemCopyMatching is for you:
var dataPtr:Unmanaged<AnyObject>?
let query: [String:AnyObject] = [
    kSecClass: kSecClassKey,
    kSecAttrApplicationTag: ""com.example.site.public"",
    kSecReturnData: kCFBooleanTrue
]
let qResult = SecItemCopyMatching(query, &dataPtr)

// error handling with `qResult` ...

let publicKeyData = dataPtr!.takeRetainedValue() as NSData

// convert to Base64 string
let base64PublicKey = publicKeyData.base64EncodedStringWithOptions(nil)

Swift 4:
var dataPtr:CFTypeRef?
let query: [String: Any] = [
    kSecClass as String: kSecClassKey,
    kSecAttrApplicationTag as String: ""com.example.site.public"",
    kSecReturnData as String: true
]

let qResult = SecItemCopyMatching(query as CFDictionary, &dataPtr)

// error handling with `qResult` ...

let data = dataPtr as! Data
let base64PublicKey = data.base64EncodedString()

Note that the size of the data is 270, not the same as block size of the key. See this question on the crypto.stackexchange.com.

","I tried your example on my machine and it works like expected. The result is an additional file in the local directory named secret_file.txt.gpg, encrypted for john@doe.com. This confirms that your actual script is fine and there might be other issues present.
You will not see any output from the script itself, the encrypted file is generated in silence. The echo in the last line of your program does nothing, because gpg does not generate any output if there are no problems. You should take a look at the manual of shell_exec.
If the file is not created on your machine, it might be a permission issue. If you do not call the script from the command line but from a web application, the webserver user needs the appropriate permissions on the file system to create a new file.

the file you are trying to encrypt is not in the right path..
GnuPG is trying to write to the /root/.gnupg directory with ""apache"" as a user. Obvisouly this is not possible unless you change you access rights to this dir (not recommended).
you don't have the right access to the GnuPG root dir (where ever it is)
you don't have WRITE in the dir apache is trying to create the new file..

","You can store in Blob, you can read the public key file and get java public key object. You can directly store this publickey object in database as blob. First do :
 byte [] bytes = publicKey.getEncoded();

then store bytes in database.
For retrieving public key do as:
public PublicKey blobToPublicKey(final byte[] blob) 
    {
        Object result = null;
        final ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(blob);
        ObjectInputStream ois;
        try
        {
            ois = new ObjectInputStream(bais);
            result = ois.readObject();
        }
        catch (final IOException e)
        {
           //

"15779392","Encrypted Key Exchange understanding","I am trying to understand the Encrypted Key Exchange mechanism. I got a little confused with this illustration:

 And did not find a lot of useful reference out there. Can anyone please explain the mechanism of EKE and how it works? What are the two sides exchanging and why that is safe to attack such as Man-in-the-middle? that will be greatly helpful. Thank you.
","While trying to find an implementation of EKE or DH-EKE, I anticipate that there are quite limited amount of references out there. The Wikipedia cross-links to each/other and the explanations I bump into are not necessarily that easy to understand. The original patent of EKE expired on 2011, leading to my understanding EAP-EKE being published. 
I found best explanation in ""Applied Cryptography"" by Bruce Schneier (2nd edition), including improvements to the algorithm. As you already have the image of the process, I'll try to layman-answer what happens there. I'm just learning myself, so I might mistake that image of yours, but it seems it's a DH-EKE implementation. I'll stick with EKE-idea on this answer, as that I think I've mostly understand ;-)
The basis is that Alice and Bob share a common secret. I might miss a point how ""weak"" it can be (in your image it's noted as weak), but let's assume it's a valid symmetric cryptography key.
Both parties have same symmetric key S, that's a shared secret

Alice generates public/private key pair unique for the session Pa (private) and P'a (public) Alice encrypts public key using S and sends it to Bob.
Bob (knowing S) decrypts Alices message and recovers Alice's public key P'a. Bob generates random session key K. Bob encrypts K with Alice's public key P'a and sends it to Alice.
Alice decrypts the message and obtains K. Alice generates random string Ra, encrypts it with K and sends to bob
Bob decrypts the message to obtain Ra, generates another random Rb, encrypts both with K and sends the encrypted message to Alice.
Alice decrypts message, verifies her own Ra being valid in the message. She encrypts only Rb with K and sends to Bob.
Bob decrypts Rb and verifies his own Rb being valid.

For Eve to pull off man-in-the-middle, she has only seen keys being encrypted with other keys. Guessworking the password from monitored traffic between Alice and Bob is not possible without cracking the public key algorithm as well. Weak shared secret however does allow Eve to try pretend to be Alice or Bob in the picture, so (my terminology may be flawed here) active attack against a listening server is possible to mount.
There are assumptions in the version that I described, best explained by others (published), Alice is trusted to generate good key pair, Bob is trusted to generate good session key. Also some algorithms suit better (or some quite much worse). There are things listed in the ""Applied Cryptography"", but as my 2nd edition seems to be a bit behind of things like AES, I'm trusting to dig more up-to-date information of good ciphers to choose for the algorithm.
For what it's worth, it seems that I need to implement EKE myself with C# and Java (Azure .NET back-end, Android client). I try to package it in a way that it could be useful for others.
UPDATE:
Very straightforward implementation on C# is available at:
https://github.com/kallex/sharp-eke-example
It's shortcutting few bits as it is now (just SHA256 of plaintext to use initial key), so take with caution. My current usage will machine-generate and distribute secure keys to both parties in separate channel, so I didn't need any more sophisticated implementation for this testbed.

"28050807","iOS Encryption using RSA public key file in DER format","I am trying to use an RSA public key to encrypt data within an iOS app to send to a customer's service over the web. The key was generated using openssl:
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.der -outform der

I then try to use the key as follows:
NSString *aPublicKeyPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""public"" ofType:@""der""];

SecCertificateRef cert = SecCertificateCreateWithData (kCFAllocatorDefault, myCertDataRef);

The contents of the cert load correctly into myCertData, but SecCertificateCreateWithData returns nil without throwing an exception. There is no result code to check, so I don't know why it isn't working.
FYI - The key appears valid. If I check the key, I get this output:

-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

Any suggestions?
UPDATE:
iOS does not appear to support directly reading a public key as generated above without some serious hacking, see this blog post where public header is manually stripped from key to get it to load. I was able to make this work, but I feel it is not a good approach for me to put into my app.
Finally got a solution I am happy with. As stated in the documentation, the certificate must be in DER format, so I regenerated it using this command and it worked:
$ openssl req -x509 -out public_key.crt -outform DER -new -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout private_key.pem

Then I use the key as follows:
NSString *aPublicKeyPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""public"" ofType:@""der""];
NSFileManager* aFileMgr = [NSFileManager defaultManager];
NSData* aCertData = [aFileMgr contentsAtPath: aPublicKeyPath];
SecCertificateRef aCertRef = SecCertificateCreateWithData(kCFAllocatorDefault, (__bridge CFDataRef)aCertData);

if (aCertRef != NULL) {
    SecKeyRef aPublicKeyRef = NULL;
    SecTrustRef aTrustRef = NULL;
    SecPolicyRef aPolicyRef = SecPolicyCreateBasicX509();

    if (aPolicyRef) {
        if (SecTrustCreateWithCertificates((CFTypeRef)aCertRef, aPolicyRef, &aTrustRef) == noErr) {
            SecTrustResultType result;
            if (SecTrustEvaluate(aTrustRef, &result) == noErr) {
                aPublicKeyRef = SecTrustCopyPublicKey(aTrustRef);
            }
        }
    }

    if (aPolicyRef) CFRelease(aPolicyRef);
    if (aTrustRef) CFRelease(aTrustRef);
    if (aCertRef) CFRelease(aCertRef);
    NSString* aClearTextString = @""This is the test string"";
    NSString* aEncryptedString = [[self class] encryptRSA:aClearTextString
                                                      key:aPublicKeyRef];
}

The encryption routine is:
+(NSString *)encryptRSA:(NSString *)plainTextString key:(SecKeyRef)publicKey         
{
    size_t cipherBufferSize = SecKeyGetBlockSize(publicKey);
    uint8_t *cipherBuffer = malloc(cipherBufferSize);
    uint8_t *nonce = (uint8_t *)[plainTextString UTF8String];
    SecKeyEncrypt(publicKey,
              kSecPaddingOAEP,
              nonce,
              strlen( (char*)nonce ),
              &cipherBuffer[0],
              &cipherBufferSize);
    NSData *encryptedData = [NSData dataWithBytes:cipherBuffer length:cipherBufferSize];
    return [encryptedData base64EncodedStringWithOptions:0];
}

","If you encrypt with the private key anyone can decrypt it but only with your public key, thus verifying that it came from you.  Of course, if you were doing that you'd probably be better off just signing your message.  The PKCS#1 standards does not define signing and encrypting identically and, indeed, the security proof for a signed message is stronger than the security proof for an encrypted message.
W.r.t. the phpseclib documentation...  it was probably just an oversight or a snafu on the developers part.  Maybe they realized the mistake but didn't want to fix it immediately as it wasn't a code issue and now just keep on forgetting about it?  I dunno...  I know I can do that.  I take more pride in my own code than I do in the documentation.

"20448764","difference between master key and session key in TLS","In TLS hanshake messages , the Client sends pre-master key to the Server.
Both sides generate a master key and use that to derive the session keys for TLS.
My question is why don't they just the master key as the symmetric key for encrypting the communication ? Why do they need to derive master key from it ?
Thanks,
","1) The master secret has a fixed size (48 bytes), which is often smaller than the amount of keying material needed for symmetric keys.  For example, the cipher suite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA requires two symmetric keys of length 32 bytes each, two initialization vectors of length 16 bytes each, and two MAC secrets of length 20 bytes each, for a total of 136 bytes.
2) The TLS protocol allows multiple connections within its sessions.  So, even if the master secret is long enough to provide all keying material for a single connection there would not be enough for all possible connections.  
3) The TLS process of generating symmetric keys from the master secret uses one-way hashes to protect the master secret from an attacker who knows some symmetric keys.  If the master secret and symmetric keys were the same (or easily computable from each other), this security guarantee would not be possible.

","You can package your public key in a X509 certificate to use the iOS built in functions easily, using openSSL:
openssl req -x509 -out public_key.pem -outform pem -new -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private_key.pem 

the PEM format is base64 encoded, you can switch the -outform to DER to get binary file.
you can import the PEM format by adding a const NSString to your program and adding category to NSData with this function:

        }
    }

    self = [self initWithData:mutableData];
    return self;
}

ofcourse you pull this file into the certificateData 
if you want to use your existing public key just pull it out and write it in a X509 cert format using openSSL
$ openssl rsa -in id_rsa -out pub.der -outform DER -pubout

good luck

How can I use Bouncy Castle, or any other C# library to generate a RSA key pair that doesn't have a key size of 65537.
If the answer is that I can directly modify this, as long as I update the private key as well, what specific changes (or re-computation) should I make for the public and private key?
Here is the sample code that I'm using to create the key with the exponent of 65537:
        // Create key
        RsaKeyPairGenerator generator = new RsaKeyPairGenerator();
        var param = new KeyGenerationParameters(new SecureRandom(), 1024);
        generator.Init(param);
         AsymmetricCipherKeyPair keyPair= generator.GenerateKeyPair();

        byte[] ret =  info.GetEncoded();
        string ovalue1 = Convert.ToBase64String(ret);

        // Read from export format
        byte[] publicKeyBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(ovalue1);
        AsymmetricKeyParameter asymmetricKeyParameter = PublicKeyFactory.CreateKey(publicKeyBytes);

        RsaKeyParameters rsaKeyParameters = (RsaKeyParameters)asymmetricKeyParameter;
        RSAParameters rsaParameters = new RSAParameters();
        rsaParameters.Modulus = rsaKeyParameters.Modulus.ToByteArray();
        rsaParameters.Exponent = rsaKeyParameters.Exponent.ToByteArray();
        RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();
        rsa.ImportParameters(rsaParameters);

","Thanks to @BrettHale I was able to solve the issue. 
This is how to create a key pair in Bouncy Castle

Is it possible to use key-based authentication to connect to an Oracle server using Python? My objective is to be able to automate some reporting I'm doing with Python without having to store a username/password anywhere in the server.
","One possible solution is to implement Oracle Wallet. Creating an Oracle Wallet entry involves having:

a tnsname resolution name established for the said instance
a username and password

Example: The Oracle sid I'm working with is named ORCL, the user I have to connect with is named my_user. In your tnsnames.ora file you already have an entry that resolves the ORCL service name/sid, create one more with exactly the same parameters:
#initial local name entry:
ORCL = (DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS_LIST = (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = my_ip)(PORT = 1528))) (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVER = DEDICATED) (SERVICE_NAME = ORCL)))

#create an additional local name entry:
ORCL_MY_USER = (DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS_LIST = (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = my_ip)(PORT = 1528))) (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVER = DEDICATED) (SERVICE_NAME = ORCL)))

After the new entry resolves successfully, create the oracle wallet entry for the ORCL_MY_USER local name. This new local name you're going to use in your python script to connect without providing or hard coding a password in it.
Example:

import cx_Oracle
db = cx_Oracle.connect(""/@ORCL_MY_USER"")
cursor = db.cursor()
r = cursor.execute(""SELECT username, password,
  account_status, default_tablespace, temporary_tablespace from
  dba_users order by username"")
for username, password, account_status, default_tablespace,
  temporary_tablespace in cursor:
    print username, '\t', password, '\t', account_status, '\t', default_tablespace, '\t', temporary_tablespace

","Yes, you do have to specify Oracle wallet's location in sqlnet.ora.

ForwardAgent option forwards the connection to your agent, with all the keys inside and does not forward your local ~/.ssh/config to remote host. What you do on the work host is controlled by your configuration on that host.

","I see you have used EVP_OpenInit(), EVP_OpenUpdate() and EVP_OpenFinal() for decryption. So I'm going to assume that you've used EVP_SealInit(), EVP_SealUpdate() and EVP_SealFinal() functions for encryption.
So if you have used EVP_SealInit(), you must have passed the address (pointer) to eklen (please check man EVP_SealInit) where the variable gets a value assigned. In analogous to that the eklen variable that you are passing to EVP_OpenInit() must contain a valid key length. 
The following is the description from man EVP_OpenInit.
EVP_OpenInit() initializes a cipher context ctx for decryption with cipher type. It decrypts the encrypted symmetric key of length ekl bytes passed in the ek parameter using the private key priv.  The IV is supplied in the iv parameter.
I'm not sure here, but I guess you need to use EVP_PKEY_size() function in this case to get the length of the key.
For example (in your decryption code):
....
..
. 
EVP_CIPHER_CTX_init(&ctx); 
ek = malloc( EVP_PKEY_size(pkey)); 

/* Add the following line */
eklen = EVP_PKEY_size(pkey);

if (!EVP_OpenInit(&ctx, EVP_aes_128_cbc(), ek, eklen, iv,pkey)) 
{ 
    fprintf(stderr, ""EVP_OpenInit: failed.\n""); 
...
..
.

I must use SOAP 1.1 and WS-Security, the service is provided by a 3rd party and I am pretty sure they wrote it using Java (IBM DataPower) (not WCf anyway).
I have tried the following, but I think it is the case of asking the wrong question as most of what I have read says that the client won't decide what is encrypted and that this is defined by the services protection level (SignAndEncrypt). I've also seen references to an X509SecurityToken that I should use to encrypt, however I think this is older .net.
Anyway this is what I have so far:
' Create the binding.
Dim myBinding As New BasicHttpBinding() ' FOR SOAP 1.1
myBinding.Security.Mode = BasicHttpSecurityMode.TransportWithMessageCredential

'Cert used for encryption
starClientProxy.ClientCredentials.ServiceCertificate.SetDefaultCertificate(StoreLocation.CurrentUser, StoreName.AddressBook, X509FindType.FindBySubjectName, ""removed"")

so now it should just encrypt it automatically? I can't find anything that I need to set
'call the service    
Dim response As wcfStarServiceProxy.AcknowledgeRepairOrderPayload = starClientProxy.ProcessMessage(payload)

So, I think I have succeeded in signing the request, however, the body isn't encrypted. How can I encrypt the body?
","I have created a custom binding to implement 2 levels of security - certificate AND username-password. I did it like this (code excerpt):
        CustomBinding customBinding = new CustomBinding();
        // ...
        HttpsTransportBindingElement httpsBindingElement = new HttpsTransportBindingElement();
        httpsBindingElement.AllowCookies = false;
        httpsBindingElement.BypassProxyOnLocal = false;
        httpsBindingElement.HostNameComparisonMode = HostNameComparisonMode.StrongWildcard;
        httpsBindingElement.MaxBufferPoolSize = 20480000;
        httpsBindingElement.MaxBufferSize = 20480000;
        httpsBindingElement.MaxReceivedMessageSize = 20480000;
        httpsBindingElement.RequireClientCertificate = true;
        httpsBindingElement.UseDefaultWebProxy = true;
        TransportSecurityBindingElement transportSecurityElement = new TransportSecurityBindingElement();
        transportSecurityElement.EndpointSupportingTokenParameters.SignedEncrypted.Add(new UserNameSecurityTokenParameters());
        transportSecurityElement.EndpointSupportingTokenParameters.SetKeyDerivation(false);
        // ...
        customBinding.Elements.Add(transportSecurityElement);
        customBinding.Elements.Add(httpsBindingElement);

This way the message is signed and encrypted by the client using the username and password, however you can modify this example and accomplish what you require.

I can do this, no problem, with the public key from the issuing source.  I have it available to me for now.  Everything works.
But what if the OAuth server changes the signing key?  How does the validating app get the new key?  Is there a ""best practices"" convention for sharing the public key from an OAuth2 server?  Do we just expose it from an endpoint on the auth server?  
","There's no solution that is standardized as part of the OAuth 2.0 protocol suite (today). 
It was considered to be a single-domain problem that would be solved in various ways that were considered to be out of scope for the core OAuth specifications (much like the API between Resource Server and Authorization Server is/was), and much like any PKI based mechanism in general works today.
But OpenID Connect is a cross-domain SSO protocol that was built on top of OAuth 2.0, which also defined a more standardized option of dealing with key distribution in the form of JWKs URIs as part of the Discover, see the jwks_uri entry at: 

REQUIRED. URL of the OP's JSON Web Key Set [JWK] document. This
  contains the signing key(s) the RP uses to validate signatures from
  the OP. The JWK Set MAY also contain the Server's encryption key(s),
  which are used by RPs to encrypt requests to the Server. When both
  signing and encryption keys are made available, a use (Key Use)
  parameter value is REQUIRED for all keys in the referenced JWK Set to
  indicate each key's intended usage. Although some algorithms allow the
  same key to be used for both signatures and encryption, doing so is
  NOT RECOMMENDED, as it is less secure. The JWK x5c parameter MAY be
  used to provide X.509 representations of keys provided. When used, the
  bare key values MUST still be present and MUST match those in the
  certificate.

This would expose the key material over HTTPs protected channel, effectively leveraging the SSL CA for publishing and rollover of JWT signing key material.
At some point the jwks_uri definition may be part of the standardized OAuth 2.0 protocol extensions as well, but for now you'd have to rely on a custom agreement between Client and Authorization Server to do so. That may not be too hard to implement yourself though.
You may get lucky if your Authorization Server happens to be an OpenID Connect provider as well and uses the same key material for signing ID tokens as well as JWT access tokens.

"4914196","public key cryptograpy with Java and OpenSSL","In an application I want to store sensitive data (which can be arbitrarily large) so that it can later be used for researching. The point is that I don't want the data to lie around unprotected, so I want to encrypt it before saving it.
On another computer (in a more trustworthy environment) I want to decrypt that data later. The decryption should be possible with readily available tools, for example OpenSSL. Now my question is: How do I do all that?
I already know the abstract steps:

Once and for all generate a public/private key pair.
Encrypt a byte[] in Java using the public key, store it somewhere.
Copy the encrypted data to a ""safer"" computer.
Decrypt the saved data using a simple OpenSSL command line.

What I'm missing now are the details:

What kind of key pair do I need?
What encryption scheme should I use? (it's probably something like ""rsa-encrypt a symmetric key, then encrypt the data with that key"")
How does the simple OpenSSL command line look like?

[Update 2011-02-13]
After a little research I found a page that describes exactly what I want to do: http://blog.altudov.com/2010/09/27/using-openssl-for-asymmetric-encryption-of-backups/. Basically the answer to my step 4 is this command line:
openssl smime -decrypt \
  -in data.smime -binary -inform DER \
  -inkey key.pem \
  -out data

Now my question is: How can I generate a file from Java whose format is compatible to OpenSSL so I can decompress it using this command line? I want to do this hundrets of times per second, so invoking an external process seems too slow. That's why I want to do it directly in Java.
","You should understand that SSL is about encrypting network traffic. Public key systems with certificates and so on are good for validating trust between parties. If you need to protect something that you will be using yourself later you should probably go without mixing the previous concepts into your solution. It makes your life easier.
Take for instance this question and the accepted answer it has as a pointer. What you probably should do is to use a hash function to generate a key from password. Then you would encrypt your data using AES. Later at a safe location you would use the same password to generate the actual key and decrypt the data.

Can anyone help me, how to read private key from .cer file.
Thanks in advance.
","Code for getting Private key from a file:
    private KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry getKeyFromFile(String keyStoreFile,
    String Password, Context cntx) {
    KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry entry = null;
    try {
        AssetManager am = cntx.getAssets();
        char[] keyStorePassword = Password.toCharArray();
        // Load the KeyStore and get the signing key and certificate.
        KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS12"");

        ks.load(am.open(keyStoreFile), keyStorePassword);
        String alias = ks.aliases().nextElement();

        Entry entry1 = ks.getEntry(alias, new KeyStore.PasswordProtection(
                keyStorePassword));
        entry = (KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry) entry1;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return entry;
}

You can decrypt your data using following method:
  public byte[] decryptUsingPrivateKey(String encryptedData, Context cntx) {

    byte[] utf8 = null;
    try {
        KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry privateKey = getKeyFromFile(
                ""PrivateKeyFile.pfx"", ""privatekeypassword"", cntx);

        Cipher rsa;
        rsa = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding"");
        rsa.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, privateKey.getPrivateKey());
        utf8 = rsa.doFinal(Base64.decode(encryptedData));

    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println(e);
    }

    return utf8;
}

Note: 

To use this you have to compile the library 'bcprov-jdk15on-152.jar' in your application
Using private key file in android is not a good practice. Hope you are using it in test server.

i want to use that key to encrypt an NSString. since its the private key, better call it sign an NSString.
can this be done without any external frameworks?
the result should be equivalent to the php openssl_sign function.
","The iOS SDK framework you will need to use is called CommonCrypto. Here's a very good article that describes the right way to go about it.
Edit: I missed the part about compatibility with the PHP function openssl_sign. The solution below resolves that.
The way to do this so that it's compatible with the PHP function openssl_sign is to use the OpenSSL library. The openssl_sign function uses OpenSSL's EVP API internally to encrypt the input string using the private key and compute the SHA-1 hash digest of that encrypted string. It's common then to convert this hash digest into a Base64-encoded string.

Unfortunately, the iOS SDK does not include OpenSSL, but it's easy to build it. The following instructions for building OpenSSL for iOS are taken from this blog post and are reproduced here to provide a complete solution to the question. 
In Terminal, follow those steps to build the OpenSSL library for iOS:
# Make a directory in which to run the build
mkdir ~/openssl-ios
cd ~/openssl-ios

# Download the openssl source (verify the file before using it in production!)
curl -O http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.1e.tar.gz

# Download the openssl iOS build script
curl -O https://raw.github.com/Raphaelios/raphaelios-scripts/master/openssl/build-openssl.sh

# Make the build script executable
chmod +x build-openssl.sh

# Run the script (takes about 3min on an Intel Core i5)
./build-openssl.sh

This will take a few minutes but once it's complete you can verify that the build library is a universal library that you can use on iOS devices and in the iOS Simulator using the following command:
lipo -info ~/openssl-ios/lib/*.a

Now that the OpenSSL library has been built, let's got on with writing the code to sign a string.

First, we need to setup the Xcode project to link against the OpenSSL library. Drag & drop both libcrypto.a and libssl.a to the Frameworks group in the Project Navigator of your iOS project. In your project's Build Settings, add the following to the Header Search Paths setting:
~/openssl-ios/include/include

Next, create a new Objective-C Category file called openssl_sign on the NSString class. In NSString+openssl_sign.h, define the following interface:
@interface NSString (openssl_sign)

- (NSString *)signStringWithPrivateKey:(NSData *)privateKey;

@end

In NSString+openssl_sign.m, add the following header imports:
#import <openssl/evp.h>
#import <openssl/pem.h>

And add the following implementation of signStringWithPrivateKey::
@implementation NSString (openssl_sign)

- (NSString *)signStringWithPrivateKey:(NSData *)privateKeyData
{
    BIO *publicBIO = NULL;
    EVP_PKEY *privateKey = NULL;

    if ((publicBIO = BIO_new_mem_buf((unsigned char *)[privateKeyData bytes], [privateKeyData length])) == NO) {
        NSLog(@""BIO_new_mem_buf() failed!"");
        return nil;
    }

    if (PEM_read_bio_PrivateKey(publicBIO, &privateKey, NULL, NULL) == NO) {
        NSLog(@""PEM_read_bio_PrivateKey() failed!"");
        return nil;
    }

    const char * cString = [self cStringUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
    unsigned int stringLength = [self length];

    unsigned char * signatureBuffer[EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE];
    int signatureLength;

    EVP_MD_CTX msgDigestContext;
    const EVP_MD * msgDigest = EVP_sha1();

    EVP_MD_CTX_init(&msgDigestContext);
    EVP_SignInit(&msgDigestContext, msgDigest);
    EVP_SignUpdate(&msgDigestContext, cString, stringLength);

    if (EVP_SignFinal(&msgDigestContext, (unsigned char *)signatureBuffer, (unsigned int *)&signatureLength, privateKey) == NO) {
        NSLog(@""Failed to sign string."");
        return nil;
    }

    EVP_MD_CTX_cleanup(&msgDigestContext);
    EVP_PKEY_free(privateKey);

    NSData *signatureData = [NSData dataWithBytes:signatureBuffer length:signatureLength];
    NSString *signature = [signatureData base64EncodedStringWithOptions:0];

    return signature;
}

@end

In the class that will be signing the string, you can now import NSString+openssl_sign.h and sign the string like so:
NSData *privateKey = ...; // Read the .pem file into a NSData variable
NSString *helloSignature = [@""hello"" signStringWithPrivateKey:privateKey];

You can verify that the signatures are the same using the following command in Terminal:
echo -n ""hello"" | openssl dgst -sha1 -sign priv.pem | openssl enc -base64 | tr -d '\n'

","You can solve this much easier with no external sources or components.
I found out how and wanted to share it so i may help others.

You need to load the key file a SecKeyRef and safe the maxPlainLen as well


    NSString *resourcePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:privateKeyResourceName ofType:@""p12""];
    NSData *p12Data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:resourcePath];

    NSMutableDictionary * options = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];

    SecKeyRef privateKeyRef = NULL;

    //change to the actual password you used here
    [options setObject:@""_YOURPASSWORDHERE__"" forKey:(__bridge id)kSecImportExportPassphrase];

    CFArrayRef items = CFArrayCreate(NULL, 0, 0, NULL);

    OSStatus securityError = SecPKCS12Import((__bridge CFDataRef) p12Data,
                                             (__bridge CFDictionaryRef)options, &items);

    if (securityError == noErr && CFArrayGetCount(items) > 0) {
        CFDictionaryRef identityDict = CFArrayGetValueAtIndex(items, 0);
        SecIdentityRef identityApp =
        (SecIdentityRef)CFDictionaryGetValue(identityDict,
                                             kSecImportItemIdentity);

        securityError = SecIdentityCopyPrivateKey(identityApp, &privateKeyRef);
        if (securityError != noErr) {
            privateKeyRef = NULL;
        }
    }
    CFRelease(items);

    privateKey = privateKeyRef;
    maxPlainLen = SecKeyGetBlockSize(privateKey) - 12;


You can convert NSString with a category method to SHA1


    - (NSData*)toSha1AsData {
        // PHP uses ASCII encoding, not UTF
        const char *s = [self cStringUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding];
        NSData *keyData = [NSData dataWithBytes:s length:strlen(s)];

        // This is the destination
        uint8_t digest[CC_SHA1_DIGEST_LENGTH] = {0};
        // This one function does an unkeyed SHA1 hash of your hash data
        CC_SHA1(keyData.bytes, keyData.length, digest);

        // Now convert to NSData structure to make it usable again
        NSData *out = [NSData dataWithBytes:digest length:CC_SHA1_DIGEST_LENGTH]

        return out;
    }


Now you can sign your SHA1 with this method


(NSData *)signSha1Data:(NSData *)data {
    size_t plainLen = [data length];
    if (plainLen > maxPlainLen) 
       {
        NSLog(@""content(%ld) is too long, must < %ld"", plainLen, maxPlainLen);
        return nil;
       }

    void *plain = malloc(plainLen);
    [data getBytes:plain
               length:plainLen];

    size_t cipherLen = 128; // currently RSA key length is set to 128 bytes
    void *cipher = malloc(cipherLen);

    OSStatus returnCode = SecKeyRawSign(privateKey, kSecPaddingPKCS1SHA1,
                                        plain, plainLen, cipher, &cipherLen);

    NSData *result = nil;
    if (returnCode != 0) {
        NSLog(@""SecKeyEncrypt fail. Error Code: %ld"", returnCode);
    }
    else {
        result = [NSData dataWithBytes:cipher
                                length:cipherLen];
    }

    free(plain);
    free(cipher);

    return result;
}

It works very well and without any external libs. There is no need to compile some wierd openssl stuff.

","I think your problem is that you are using double instead of long (integer values), since doubles are stored only as approximations to the real number you might get rounding errors. See also this post Why is modulus operator not working for double in c#?
If you are dealing with larger values you will have to use a Structure with arbitrary size like BigInteger.

Any ideas how to repeatably encrypt text using RSA?
","The output of an RSA cipher is not the same each time for a given plaintext when using an appropriate padding scheme (generally PKCS#1 or OAEP padding). Encrypting a given plaintext will result in different ciphertext each time. If the cipher generated the same output for a given input every time it would be a security vulnerability.
That being said you can force Java to use a non padded RSA cipher by using the spec ""RSA/ECB/NOPADDING"" for Cipher.getInstance(String). Doing so will result in your tests passing, but as I said earlier this is not very secure.

Any ideas how to repeatably encrypt text using RSA?
","RSA is a public-key encryption scheme.  It sounds like you actually want to use a hashing algorithm (e.g. SHA-256 or SHA-512).  I say this because you say:

This means I can't use my encryption to test if entered text is equal
  to a stored result of a previous encryption.

If this is your goal, you should use a hashing algorithm.  By design, RSA encryption should include a padding step to ensure that the ciphertext differs:

To avoid these problems, practical RSA implementations typically embed some form of structured, randomized padding into the value m before encrypting it. This padding ensures that m does not fall into the range of insecure plaintexts, and that a given message, once padded, will encrypt to one of a large number of different possible ciphertexts.

","It's impossible to fully protect your software from piracy. No matter what, you will have to distribute your public key in some way and then pirates can swap it with their own.

The same way you protect against someone disabling the digital signature check entirely. Your question is like asking how you keep a thief from coming in your second story leftmost window. That's not the window he's going to go through, and in any event, you keep him out the same way you keep him from coming through your other windows.

","There are two ways to prevent signing with new Pair of keys. 

Embed the public key with the DLL. This way public key is hidden.
Use a public key Pinning techniques. This involves obtaining a certificate from a signing authority which difficult for individuals. This whole thing falls under PKI (Public Key Infrastructure).
Third way is to Apply an Asymmetric encryption technique(AES for example) to encrypt your signed license file and embed it in your license dll. This makes the information in license a little less obvious and will prevent the basic attacks.

","You need to use AES for encrypting large data. RSA cannot encrypt data larger than key's size. 
So you can encrypt an AES key with RSA, and the whole image with AES (256 bit) (i.e. generate different AES key for each image). 
Also RSA is very slow and thus is not good for encrypting large data, if you want to split up an image to a large number of blocks of size 117 bytes and encrypt them one by one.

For example:
  public static byte[] encrypt(byte[] data) {
    try {
        KeyPair keyPair = initalizeKeyPair();

        final javax.crypto.Cipher rsa = javax.crypto.Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");
        rsa.init(javax.crypto.Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, keyPair.getPublic());

        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();

        final byte[] secretKey = new byte[16];
        random.nextBytes(secretKey);

        final javax.crypto.Cipher aes = javax.crypto.Cipher.getInstance(""AES"");
        SecretKeySpec k = new SecretKeySpec(secretKey, ""AES"");
        aes.init(javax.crypto.Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, k);

        final byte[] ciphedKey = rsa.doFinal(secretKey);
        final byte[] ciphedData = aes.doFinal(data);

        byte[] result = new byte[256 + ciphedData.length];

        System.arraycopy(ciphedKey, 0, result, 0, 256);
        System.arraycopy(ciphedData, 0, result, 256, ciphedData.length);

        return result;

","I'm not 100% following it, but I think your issue could be as follows:
Public/Private key pairs are not used to encrypt data. They are used only to encrypt fixed-size blocks of data, which are short - on the order of the size of the public/private key themselves.
So they way these are used is that the public/private key is used to encrypt [something like] an AES Key - which in-turn is used with a mode (like EBC, etc) to encrypt a stream, or irregularly-sized block of data.
I think you are trying to use the Public/Private keypair to encrypt your user-data, which is likely not the correct size for the public/private key operations - thus your leaking and getting an BAD_ACCESS_ERROR.

I already omitted all error checking from the original code. I'm using Visual Studio 2012 and .NET 4.5, although this is nothing new to 4.5, it should work with any version.
I am trying to sign an XML documents' elements to protect them from tampering. I don't want to protect the whole document, but only certain elements. Maybe even different elements with different keys. 
However, when I sign three example elements and try to verify them, the first one always verifies, the other two fail. To make it even worse, the first one even succeeds if I modify it after being signed. I have googled a lot, read a lot of tutorials and even asked a theoretical question here, but I don't have any clue what I'm doing wrong. Can anybody spot my mistake?

The difference: All signatures are direct childs of the root element:
public static void Main()

public static void Sign(this XmlElement element, X509Certificate2 certificate)
{
    var identifier = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(""N"");
    element.SetAttribute(""Id"", identifier);

    var signedXml = new SignedXml(element) { SigningKey = certificate.PrivateKey };
    signedXml.AddReference(new Reference(""#"" + identifier));
    signedXml.ComputeSignature();

    var xmlDigitalSignature = signedXml.GetXml();

    element.OwnerDocument.DocumentElement.AppendChild(
        element.OwnerDocument.ImportNode(xmlDigitalSignature, true));
}

public static bool VerifySignature(this XmlElement element, X509Certificate2 certificate)
{
    var signedXml = new SignedXml(element.OwnerDocument);
    signedXml.LoadXml(element);

    return signedXml.CheckSignature(certificate, true);
}

One important detail to notice: PreserveWhitespace needs to be set to true for signedDoc, too.

The identity provider encrypts the SAML assertion using the service provider's public key. The service provider will decrypt the assertion using its private key.
If you'd like to see an example of this, please take a look at the AssertionExample project which demonstrates encrypting/decrypting SAML assertions.
Step 2 at the link you supplied describes the SP sending an AuthnRequest via HTTP/POST to the IdP. There is no XML encryption involved in sending an AuthnRequest.

","An encoding algorithm merely presents data in an alternative format. It does not in any way attempt to hide data, it merely expresses the same data in an alternative syntax. Base64 is such an encoding algorithm. It merely encodes arbitrary data using only ASCII characters, which is useful in many situations in which non-ASCII characters may not be handled correctly.

","The difference between encoding and encrypting is in whether you need to know a secret in order to get back the original form. base64 is an encoding because all you need to know is the algorithm to encode/decode. 
When something is encrypted, there's a secret key that's used, and you need to know the key in order to decrypt it. There's two general types of encryption:

symmetric encryption = the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt. The correspondents using this encryption both need to know this key.
asymmetric encryption = different keys are used to encrypt and decrypt. This is also called public key encryption because you can make one of the keys well known (public), while keeping the other one secret (private). This allows anyone to encrypt a message that using the public key, while only the person who knows the private key can decrypt it, or vice versa.

"23986171","is fingerprint of public cert unique?","I would like to store public cert in a database, but I need an attribute of the public cert to index the public certs in the database. I would like to make this a unique field.
Is the finger print of a public cert unique?
","The fingerprint is unique (for all practical intents); two different certificates should never share the same hash.  For example, per the  Windows X509certificate2.thumbprint documentation:

the thumbprint is a unique value for the certificate, it is commonly used to find a particular certificate in a certificate store.

Per the OpenSSL documentation:

Because of the nature of message digests the fingerprint of a certificate is unique to that certificate and two certificates with the same fingerprint can be considered to be the same.

Note the fingerprint is not part of the certificate.  Rather, it is calculated by taking a cryptographic hash of the entire certificate (including the signature).  Different cryptographic implementations may use different hashing algorithms to compute the fingerprint, and thus provide different fingerprints for the same certificate. (For example, the Windows Crypto API computes the SHA-1 hash of the certificate to compute the thumbprint, whereas OpenSSL can generate the SHA-256 or SHA-1 hash.)   You will thus need to ensure that clients using the database fingerprint are using the same API, or a consistent hashing algorithm.
In theory, a duplicate fingerprint shared by multiple certificates would require a hash collision.  The probability of such an event occurring by chance is astronomical.  Intentionally generating such a certificate pair would require a successful preimage attack on the underlying hash function, an attack not known to be feasible on SHA-1 (see Preimage Attack).

","I did something very similar.  But in my case it was a simple telephone authorisation code.  User would phone a number, give their company name and the operation they were performing, get a code, type it into the application and then be able to proceed.
What I did was serialise a piece of data into binary.  The data included the hashed company name, operation code/expiration date, and had space to spare for future requirements.  I then scattered the bits around the array to confuse it.  Then I mapped each 5 bits of the binary array onto a 32 character auth-code alphabet (0-9,a-z,excluding I/O/Q/S for readability over telephone).
This resulted in a nice auth-code which was 16 characters, displayed as 4x4 blocks (####-####-####-####).  It could be easily read out over the telephone, as the user only had to listen to four characters at a time, or even sent via SMS.
As with your problem, it wasn't intended to stop the code crackers at Bletchley Park, but was enough to stop the average office worker from doing something without following company procedure.  And, given that scope, has been very effective.

"20433899","TLS Handshaking and SSL Session Reuse","I have a website (from a client) that is hitting a WCF Service on my Win 2008 R2 Standard server. The WCF Service is hosted on IIS 7.5. The connection is HTTPS encrypted. I do not have access to the client's server.
In order to debug an issue, I need to examine the request the client is sending. I am using WireShark 1.10.3. for this. I am able to get the decrypted information provided I have WireShark running first and the 2 servers connect using a Full Handshake. WireShark cannot decrypt if the servers are using an Abbreivated Handshake.
Abbreviated Handshake is employing a technique called SSL Session Reuse, where the two servers store the encryption/decryption information in a cache. This eliminates steps needed in a Full Handshake and saves CPU on future requests. I read that the default TTL for this cache is 10 hours, however I have not found where to set that. TLS by specification does a Full handshake when there is no information in either servers cache. After the Full Handshake, it automatically caches the info so it can then do the Abbreviated Handshake.
Since I am debugging, I have to run many scenarios many times.
I have found that the only way for me to ensure that the two servers do a Full Handshake is to reboot my server. This clears the cache and session information and the servers are forced to do a Full Handshake.
Obviously, rebooting my server everytime I come back to testing this issue is not ideal. I did some research and found some articles that suggest I can disable the SSL Session Reuse by setting the registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\ClientCacheTime\Value to 0.
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/huizhu/archive/2009/12/17/ssl-_2f00_tls-full-handshake-vs.-abbreviated-handshake.aspx
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/247658
The articles suggest that this will disable the caching of the encryption information. However this has not worked for me. Am I missing something?
Is there another way to disable SSL Session Reuse or a way to bust the cache without having to reboot?
","Here are some ideas: 
1) Have the client clear their session cache, if this is possible and easier than rebooting their server.  
2) Send the requests through an HTTPS proxy (e.g., burpsuite).  This would most likely require configuring the client to use your proxy.  Restarting or clearing the proxy cache would lead to a full TLS handshake.
3) Use a TLS reverse proxy to receive incoming requests on the server IP and port and forward them to the server.  No proxy configuration is required at the client.  Just restart the proxy to start the full handshake.  If the server requires HTTPS, use upstream SSL on the proxy.  If the server can use HTTP, you can send traffic in the clear between proxy and server and use Wireshark to directly view the traffic.  This might be helpful: https://serverfault.com/questions/583374/configure-nginx-as-reverse-proxy-with-upstream-ssl
4) Flip a bit or drop a packet on an existing TLS connection between client and server.  This will cause a fatal alert (integrity check fails, indicating a possible MITM attack), which will invalidate that session and require the next request to initiate a full handshake.

Now one clue is, the known hosts tab has a host fingerprint that does not match the fingerprint of my key. My key is something like f1:19: etc and the hosts fingerprint is different. I hope I can fix this soon. Any suggestions would be great.
ssh-add -l = two private keys that I am using. So its not this.

Another clue is, after going into my putty program and changes the private key that it ses suddenly is i try to connect to ssh with a key acces in eclipse the error it throws shows reflects the same key that I just changed in putty!! Somehow eclipse seems to be using putty for public key access. How do I stop this?!
","Okay here's the solution. For whatever reason Egit uses putty to connect to ssh using the configuration putty is set to use to access a server with a public key. The way you fix this is to make sure putty is able to connect to the server using a public key. If it can't then try this:

Download puttygen
Generate a rsa key using either ssh shell or the key management tab on eclipse. Do not generate a key using puttygen. For whatever reason it never worked for me.
Load the private key you generated (not generated with puttygen) into puttygen and then save as a putty private key (.ppk)
Go to eclipses key management tab and set it to recognize the new .ppk private key file
Finally go to putty, and create your servers profile by assigning the address and then go to auth and load the .ppk file. DISABLE pageant.
Save and attempt to connect to server using the key and if successful then congratulations Egit and Eclipse will now be able to make connections using keys.

"6117617","RSA encryption from Flex client and Corresponding Decryption from Web service","I'm having a problem setting up RSA encryption/decryption mechanism between flex client and web service written in c#. The idea is this: I'll encrypt some text from flex and then decrypt it from web service.  I'm using as3crypto library from google. It is encrypting/decrypting text properly. I also have the code on the web service side to encrypt/decrypt properly. My problem is synchronizing them - basically sharing the public key to flex and keeping the private key to the web service. 
My flex ""encrypt"" function takes modulus and exponent of RSA to do text encryption, so how do i get these modulus and exponent attributes from the web service's RSACryptoServiceProvider, so they speak the same standard. 
I tried the 
RSAKeyInfo.Modulus
RSAKeyInfo.Exponent
from the web service and fed them to the flex client.
After doing encryption on flex I took the cipher text and fed it to decrypt method on web service, but it is giving me ""bad data"" error message.
System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException: Bad Data.

How do i make sure they are both using the same byte 64 or 128 byte encryption . ie the input from flex should fit to what is expected by the web service RSACryptoServiceProvider's decrypt method.
(I'm assuming the size might be a problem, may be it's not - i'm lost)
Here is the code, first flex client followed by web service c# code
private function encrypt():void {
                var rsa:RSAKey = RSAKey.parsePublicKey(getModulus(), getExponent());
                trace(""Modulus Lenght: "" + getModulus().length);
                trace(""Exponent Lenght : "" + getExponent().length);
                var data:ByteArray = getInput();  //returns byteArray of plainText
                var dst:ByteArray = new ByteArray;
                rsa.encrypt(data, dst, data.length);
                trace(""Enc Data: "" + dst.toString() );
                currentResult = Hex.fromArray(dst);
                encryptedText = currentResult;
                trace(""Encrypted:: "" + currentResult);
            }

            //For testing purposes

                var data:ByteArray = Hex.toArray(encryptedText);
                trace(""Byte array: "" + data.toString());

Any kinda comment / advice/ or recommended solution is welcome,
thanks guys
","I use as3crypto and JAVA web-services.  Here are some thoughts:
a. I generated my public and private RSA keys via openssl
b.  My client loads the public .cer file at application startup (if you just hardcoded them in from the generated key that works too).
var pemString : String = new String(data.target.data);
var x509Cert : X509Certificate = new X509Certificate(pemString);
var publicRSAKey : RSAKey = x509Cert.getPublicKey();

c. Encrypt my strings via
var inputByteArray : ByteArray = Hex.toArray(Hex.fromString(inputString));
var outputByteArray : ByteArray = new ByteArray();
appSettingsModel.publicRSAKey.encrypt(inputByteArray, outputByteArray, inputByteArray.length);

d. I didn't write the JAVA side of things but you aren't using JAVA anyways. I know that as3crypto uses PKCS1 padding by default:
RSAKEY.as
private function _encrypt(op:Function, src:ByteArray, dst:ByteArray, length:uint, pad:Function, padType:int):void {
            // adjust pad if needed
            if (pad==null) pad = pkcs1pad;

This can be changed but I haven't tried it yet.  Based on your code it looks like you might be trying to decrypt with OAEP scheme, but I can't tell how you are setting that bool.  You may want to take a look at what padding scheme is being used with the bool as false and try to change one side or the other to match padding strategies.

","Seems overly complicated.  I've worked on some high security systems before, but this is ludicrous.  Why would you need this kind of level of encryption at the text being sent unless you don't want the user to know the text he just inputted?
Just use a strong SSL key (256bit is max for IE6, you could use 512 but only compatible with newer browsers) for the actual transfer protocol (I imagine HTTP) with a binary data format (AMF) and everything should be fine.  I doubt your system is that important to leverage the use of encrypting text.

I'm not quite sure if this RSA set up is the way to go... 
Any kinda comment / advice/ or recommended solution is welcome,
thanks guys
","Eureka! Eureka! I got it.
The problem was after decryption from web service, the encrypted byte array missed 0's in between, so that when changed to string it gets unreadable '????????' text. So I just put paddWithZeros() function to pad the decrypted byte array with 0's between bytes and it worked.
Thanks Kevin, your solution gave me an insight into what things I should consider. So during decrypting I specify parameter fOAEP as false, so it would use PKCS#1 for padding (making both libraries use the same standard).
RSA.Decrypt(DataToDecrypt, DoOAEPPadding); // DoOAEPPadding = false

another error that i was getting is Bad Data exception. This was fixed when i shared the RSA cryptoServiceProvider's parameters (modulus and exponent) to actionScript methods.
I also changed the byte[] array of c# RSA attributes (like Modulus n, Exponent e, Private d..etc) to hexa string so that I'd be able to share with as3crypto library.
I'd love to share what worked for me; save others some time.

"10727133","OpenSSL RSA: Unable to encrypt/decrypt messages longer than 16 bytes","I'm working on a simple program that uses OpenSSL to do basic RSA encryption and decryption. It is working fine for small messages (<16 bytes), but fails for anything over that. I understand that a limitation of public key cryptography is that you cannot encrypt anything longer than the key size. In my case, I'm using a 1024bit key, so I should have 128bytes to work with (maybe slightly less due to padding), correct? If so, that's not what I'm experiencing.
Here's the output from my program with 15 bytes:
Generating RSA keypair...done.
Message to encrypt: 0123456789ABCDE
16 bytes encrypted
Decrypted message: 0123456789ABCDE

And with 16 bytes:

It seems that no matter what, only a total of 16 bytes are encrypted.

Any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you.
EDIT: As pointed out by math below, it seems that the answer to my mistake was hiding in the OpenSSL here: https://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/EVP_EncryptInit.html#
","This is because you do not properly handle out and outl parameters in EVP_SealUpdate(), EVP_SealFinal(), EVP_OpenUpdate() and EVP_OpenFinal().
Each EVP_XxxxUpdate() and EVP_XxxxFinal() call will contribute to the output buffer. So, you are required to keep track of the seal/open process by summing each outl returned and providing the expected buffer each time (start of buffer + already handled bytes).
unsigned char* rsa_seal(...)
{
  ...
  **enc_msg_len = 0;

  EVP_SealUpdate(ctx, encrypt + **enc_msg_len, &outl, msg, (int)msg_len);
  **enc_msg_len += outl;

  EVP_SealFinal(ctx, encrypt + **enc_msg_len, &outl);
  **enc_msg_len += outl;
  ...
}

char* rsa_open(...)
{
  ...
  dec_len = 0;

  EVP_OpenUpdate(ctx, decrypt + dec_len, &outl, enc_msg, (int)*enc_msg_len);
  dec_len += outl;

  EVP_OpenFinal(ctx, decrypt + dec_len, &outl);
  dec_len += outl;
  ...
}

The program was working with 15-bytes buffer because in that case, the EVP_XxxxUpdate() call is returning 0 in outl (not enough data to seal/open a block), hiding the problem in your code logic.
Note: The data is not directly encrypted using the RSA key but using a generated symetric key (AES-128 in your case). This is why the block size is 16 bytes.

","Apparently the SSH Server sshd is not listening on port 22. Have you installed it yet? (A guide to do so, suggested by Peter: https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/serverguide/openssh-server.html)
An other reason that sshd does not start might be a faulty configuration in /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Error messages for that should appear in the /var/log/auth.log log file. Alternatively you can try to run sudo service ssh start. Error messages should then also be printed in the current window.
Finally, sshd might be listening on a non-default port. Usually you would be aware of that, though, as it requires manual changes to the configuration. You can get an overview of all open ports by calling sudo netstat -tulpen. In the defaul case you'll have a line with sshd in the Program name column and 0.0.0.0:22 in the LocalAddress column. This means that sshd is listening on all ipv4 interfaces available (0.0.0.0) on port 22 (:22). If you find a different port there (e.g. 12345), you can tell ssh to connect to it instead using the -p flag (ssh localhost -p 12345).

","You should obtain public key of the recipient of the message, and generate your own secret key (if you need to sign files). Also PGP allows password-based encryption, if this suits your needs.
Also I would recommend to take a look on commercial libraries (like SecureBlackbox) as well. They are costy, but includes much better support, demos, documentation, etc.

","None.
Public and private key are used to negotiate a symmetric encryption key, that will be used during that session. Asymmetric encryption uses two keys (private and public), symmetric encryption uses only one.
Your server sends its public key to a client, the client validates that key signature (check the CA and all that) then use it to encrypt a randomly selected key that will be used as symmetric encryption key, and send it to the server. Because only the private key can decrypt that message, the message is secure, only the server can decrypt it. Then the server accepts that key selected by the client, and they start to transmit data using symmetric encryption.
Why all this? asymmetric encryption is quite computionally expensive, so it is just used to ensure that client and server can negotiate a secure symmetric key without sending it in plain text. Symmetric encryption is cheap.
Symmetric encryption is also safe, the problem is that both parts must know the key before start, and that is a big issue. By using asymmetric encryption for negotiating the key, this problem is solved.
UPDATE
Well, it seems that @EJP does not agree with my answer, so I tried to find some more documentation that explain the thing in an easy way.
http://www.techradar.com/news/software/how-ssl-and-tls-works-1047412

SSL explained
When you visit a bank's website, the bank's server will automatically
  redirect you to its secure site using the HTTPS protocol before you
  can log in. This results in your browser and the bank's site
  negotiating a secure channel using SSL.
This negotiation goes a little like this (note that I've simplified it
  greatly). The browser sends a message stating what the latest version
  of SSL it can support and a list of symmetric algorithms it can use.
  The web server sends back a message with the version of SSL and the
  algorithm that will be used.
It sends its certificate as well. The client verifies the certificate
  using the known certificates that came with the browser; in other
  words, it checks that it has been signed by a trusted CA and that it
  hasn't expired.
If the certificate is valid, the browser generates a one-time key for
  the session, encrypts it with the server's public key (it's part of
  the certificate), and sends it to the server. The server decrypts the
  key, then uses that key together with the agreed symmetric algorithm
  for the rest of the session.

I may be confused.

Yes.

that any clients can use to encrypt their request.

No.

Since my server is the only one who has the private key to decrypt any message encryped using server's public key, any request sent this way can be considered secure.

That's not how it works.

However my question is at the response part. When the server sends the response back to the client, whose public key will the server use to encrypt the response message?

None.

I assume the server will use client's public key to encrypt the response (by default? or upon configuration?).

No. See below. In most SSL connections the server doesn't even know the client's public key,if indeed the client even has one. This only occurs in so-called 'mutual' SSL, Where both peers authenticate to each other.

If so, does the server knows the client's public key from the request it sends to the server, or somehow else?

It only knows the public key if the client sends its certificate, which only happens if the server is configured to request it, which it usually isn't.
HTTPS runs over SSL, which uses a symmetric session key negotiated independently by both peers. It is never transmitted. The server's key is only used to provide a digital signature over its certificate, which the client can verify, which proves that that server owns that certificate. From there on it is all symmetric negotiation and encryption.

So, my server maintains its private key and publish a public key that any clients can use to encrypt their request. Since my server is the only one who has the private key to decrypt any message encryped using server's public key, any request sent this way can be considered secure.
However my question is at the response part. When the server sends the response back to the client, whose public key will the server use to encrypt the response message?
I assume the server will use client's public key to encrypt the response (by default? or upon configuration?). If so, does the server knows the client's public key from the request it sends to the server, or somehow else?
Update:
If I understand it incorrectly, then during future communications how each party knows how to decrypt the message the other one sends? Is some key shared or somehow?
Thanks!
","Public keys are not directly used to encrypt any of the the underlying HTTP traffic on an HTTPS connection; neither the HTTP request nor the HTTP response are encrypted this way.  Rather, during the initial SSL handshake, a session specific symmetric key is negotiated between the client and the server, and it's the symmetric key that is then used to encrypt all traffic on the HTTP connection in both directions.
The specific mechanism by which the symmetric key is negotiated depends on the specific cipher suite that is negotiated between client and server.  This negotiation always involves the server's public key and a value sent by the client; it may also involve items like a client public key or separate connection specific public keys from the server and client.

","Okay ... I am not sure that the following is a complete solution, its just a fix that a found for my current project, I am still not satisfied with my answer.
So, by reading my question, you will observe that I mentioned that the CA was made on a linux machine and certificates for client and server were signed by that CA. That host is another VMWare VM, call it ""VM3"". So certificates I generated using ""CA123"" on ""VM3"" for client and server didn't work on client VM (call it ""VM1"") and server VM(call it ""VM2""). Out of curiosity, I tried to setup a CA on the VM2, and sign client and server certificates, and copied client certificate to client VM. To my surprise, it works, but I don't know why. I can't answer what kind of dependency did I create on VM3 ?
Feel free to post a more accurate and complete answer.

I'm using PKCS#1 padding on the C# side (setting the fOAEP parameter of RSACryptoServiceProvider.Encrypt to false), so I'd expect that after decrypting the block in python I should see some kind of clear text (i.e. my ""message"" together with padding bytes)

r = Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.construct((modulus, exponent, d, p, q))

where modulus, exponent, d, p and q are the respective fields of the .NET-RSAParameters structure. (as I've mentioned, I can encrypt/decrypt a message using this key in python, also p*q yields modulus, so I think the key import is working correctly ...)

So, 02 at the beginning points to random padding (somehow I was expecting 0xff padding...). The last 6 bytes (after the zero) are exactly the ""Message"" I was expecting, but a normal print didn't show them just because of the zero byte...

Extract Exponent and Modulus from the public key

Store key length, exponent an modulus in Source, compile and deploy (Drop leading zeroes from the Modulus to make it work)

","You have the private key, so it's probably easier to generate a self-signed certificate from the key. You can use System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate (I think you should have the certificate in DER / ASN.1 format rather thant PEM) to load the certificate and X509Certificate.GetPublicKey() to get the public key.

What tool can provide the hash for CertificatePublicKey?
edit: Without using heat, I want to understand where the hashes come from.
edit: I'm aware of how this is done in WiX source code and that I can execute
heat payload file -out file.wxs, but I'm looking for some external tool which can provide the expected hash(es) without using heat.  This is really only to sate my curiosity.
","If you take a look at the sourcecode of the heat tool it uses the Microsoft.Tools.WindowsInstallerXml.Cab.Interop.NativeMethods.HashPublicKeyInfo function to generate the CertificatePublicKey. 
byte[] publicKeyIdentifierHash = new byte[128];
uint publicKeyIdentifierHashSize = (uint)publicKeyIdentifierHash.Length;

Microsoft.Tools.WindowsInstallerXml.Cab.Interop.NativeMethods.HashPublicKeyInfo(
    certificate.Handle, 
    publicKeyIdentifierHash, 
    ref publicKeyIdentifierHashSize);

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(((int)publicKeyIdentifierHashSize + 1) * 2);
for (int i = 0; i < publicKeyIdentifierHashSize; ++i)
{
    sb.AppendFormat(""{0:X2}"", publicKeyIdentifierHash[i]);
}

this.PublicKey = sb.ToString();

You can obviously use this code to generate the thumbprint or according to the wiki page on Public Key fingerprints you can also use the commandline 
ssh-keygen -lf /path/to/key.pub

The problem is generating a ssh-keygen pub file that complies with RFC4716 from the certificate and this is where I was stumped.
Personally I just use the heat command-line: 
heat.exe payload PATH_TO_FILE -o Output.wxs

and not worry about what it is actually doing as it works!! :)

","You can find all the information about a signature in the file properties dialog:

In the file properties dialog, click the signature tab.

Click details, then click 'View Certificate'.

Properties like 'Public Key' can be found on the 'Details' tab.

 If you need a hash of this Public Key, then you can use your standard hashing tools to get it by using the 'Copy to File' button and hashing that file.
I was incorrect, the 'Copy to File' does not export the selected property, but instead the whole certificate. You can copy and paste this value into a hash program or a hex editor to get the hash though.

Conversely, a message encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the owner of the private key.

","In SSL communication,when the client wants to interact with some server, the server sends its public key. Always remember a certificate is nothing but a public key with a bunch of supporting information. 
The problem here is any hacker can masquerade as a server and can block the communication between server and client. So the server certificate must be signed by some certificate authority. The client only believes the server certificate if it is signed by a certificate authority.In that case the hacker in between can not masquerade as a server because its certificate will not be authenticated by the certificate authority.
So client accepts the certificate and gets the public key of server. Now the client can send its public key encrypted by the public key of the server. Since this encrypted message can only be decrypted by the private key of the server so only server can decrypt it.
But the use of public key and private key over the ssl communication can slow down the connection very much because these keys lengths are 1024 or 2048 bits. 
So practically what happens is instead of sending its own public key, the client sends the symmetric key encrypted by the public key of the server. Server decrypts it with its private key and it gets to know the symmetric key. Now the further communication happens with this symmetric key encryption and decryption.Since no third party gets to know the symmetric key, the communication will be secure.
Remember symmetric key lengths are generally 64-128 unlike public keys hence less the time for encryption and decryption.

The server keeps its private key and the public key is shared to the users.


Correct.

So the client trusts the content thats coming from the server using the public key.

No. There is no 'so' about it. The client trusts the server certificate because it is signed by someone he trusts, and he knows it belongs to the server because the server provides a digital signature that the client can verify, which only the private key owner can do. Therefore he knows that the server owns that public key.

How does the client encrypt the contents he is sending back to the server ?.

The client and server negotiate a shared session key independently using techniques described in RFC 2246. For the most part they don't involve PKI at all.

Using the public key of the server? or does the client send a autogenerated private key and encrypts it using the public key which is then decypted by the server along with the message and used for furthter communication by both parties.

Neither, see above. This is quite a large subject.


A Public and a Private key is required to do ssl communication.


No. One of the parties must have a private key and a corresponding certificate that the other party trusts, otherwise the communication is insecure.

This Key pair is generated using a self signed certificate

No. The statement doesn't even make sense. Key pairs are generated first, nothing to do with certificates yet. The certificate is a wrapper for the public key.

How can a single self signed certificate contain both public and private keys.

It can't, and it doesn't. Self-signing doesn't have anything to do with it either.

"18856431","RSA keys transformation for Java - clarification needed?","I read a bit about the known issue of transforming keys from PEM to DER so Java can read them, and I ran up this article. When followed through, this works OK - generated RSA key pair with openssl, keys are loaded fine, and what is encrypted with public key is successfully decoded with the private key.
Now, here's the unclear part.
Not so long ago, I generated PKI using Easy-RSA utility, while setting up OpenVPN server. Here, a self-signed cert was created. Output files, among others are:  

server.csr ------ // certificate request
  server.key ------// private key
  server.crt -------// self-signed certificate/public-key/whatever this is..?

Just for the reference, easy-RSA is documented (on the bottom of the page are the scripts explained, and we can see openssl commands actually used in the process).   
So, I tried the above logic on these files, using server.key as my private key file, and  server.crt as my public key file, both previously transformed to Java-readable DER format:  

openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform DER -in server.key -out server_private_key.der -nocrypt
  openssl x509 -inform PEM -outform DER -text -in server.crt -out server.der

Private key, not so strangely, works OK, i.e. it is successfully loaded in Java.
Public key (again, probably not so strangely) won't load, but I don't know the reason, since I'm not really familiar with all these things. My guess is that this has something to do with certificate being signed, and I wonder how to deal with this in those cases. I get the following exception:  
java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException: java.security.InvalidKeyException:IOException: ObjectIdentifier() -- data isn't an object ID (tag = -96)
  at sun.security.rsa.RSAKeyFactory.engineGeneratePublic(RSAKeyFactory.java:188)

  at sun.security.rsa.RSAKeyFactory.generatePublic(RSAKeyFactory.java:281)
  at sun.security.rsa.RSAKeyFactory.engineGeneratePublic(RSAKeyFactory.java:184)
  ... 3 more

Furthermore, when I ""export"" the public key from the existing server.key private key file, like this (as in the above article):  

openssl rsa -in server.key -pubout -outform DER -out server_public_key.der

it all works fine again.  
So, my question is: what is the right way, and why server.crt won't load as public key ?
","The Java code in the article you linked is expecting a public key file, not an X509 Certificate, which is what you have in server.crt.
An X509 certificate contains the public key as well as identity information that is bound to that key via the signature.
From Java's X509Certificate documentation, you can find this code:
 InputStream inStream = null;
 try {
     inStream = new FileInputStream(""fileName-of-cert"");
     CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance(""X.509"");
     X509Certificate cert = (X509Certificate)cf.generateCertificate(inStream);
 } finally {
     if (inStream != null) {
         inStream.close();
     }
 }

And once you have an X509 certificate object, you can easily get the PublicKey like this:
PublicKey myPubKey = cert.getPublicKey();

","Python 3 doesn’t have very much in its standard library that deals with encryption. Instead, you get hashing libraries
If you need secure hashes or message digest algorithms, then Python’s standard library has you covered in the  hashlib  module
If you want to encrypt your data with RSA, then you’ll need to either have access to a public / private RSA key pair or you will need to generate your own. For this example, we will just generate our own. Since it’s fairly easy to do, we will do it in Python’s interpreter:
you must first install PyCrypto package for python 3 
>>> from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

>>> code = 'nooneknows'

>>> key = RSA.generate(2048)

>>> encrypted_key = key.exportKey(passphrase=code, pkcs=8, 

 protection=""scryptAndAES128-CBC"")

>>> with open('/path_to_private_key/my_private_rsa_key.bin', 'wb') as f:

 f.write(encrypted_key)

>>> with open('/path_to_public_key/my_rsa_public.pem', 'wb') as f:

 f.write(key.publickey().exportKey())

First, we import RSA from Crypto.PublicKey. Then we create a silly passcode. Next we generate an RSA key of 2048 bits. Now we get to the good stuff. To generate a private key, we need to call our RSA key instance’s exportKey method and give it our passcode, which PKCS standard to use and which encryption scheme to use to protect our private key. Then we write the file out to disk.
Next, we create our public key via our RSA key instance’s publickey method. We used a shortcut in this piece of code by just chaining the call to exportKey with the publickey method call to write it to disk as well.

"13588822","How to change the passphrase of a private key using PHP's OpenSSL module?","I'm using PHP's OpenSSL module for asymmetric encryption; openssl_pkey_new(), openssl_pkey_export(), and openssl_pkey_get_details() to create the keypair, and openssl_public_encrypt and openssl_private_decrypt() to encrypt and decrypt data.
How can I change the passphrase associated with the private key? Is this possible with the OpenSSL module, or do I have to create a new keypair? That would be extremely inconvenient and require the server to re-encrypt potentially thousands of files on a regular Basis.
Thanks!
","I've needed to do this for a little project I've been building in the evenings.
We know the following creates a new key pair (public/private):
function newPair (&$private, &$public, $passphrase=null) {
    $res = openssl_pkey_new ();
    if ($res === false) {
        throw new Exception (""Key generation failed: "".openssl_error_string ());
        return false;
    }
    // Sets private by reference
    if (openssl_pkey_export ($res, $private, $passphrase) === false) {
        throw new Exception (""Private key export failed: "".openssl_error_string ());
        return false;
    }
    // Array returns, contains ""key"" element.
    $public = openssl_pkey_get_details($res);
    if ($public === false) {
        throw new Exception (openssl_error_string ());
        return false;
    }
    $public = $public[""key""];
    return true;
}

open_ssl_pkey_export() does the passphrase magic.  So we can change the passphrase as so:
function changePassphrase ($private, $old, $new=null) {
    $res = openssl_pkey_get_private ($private, $old);
    if ($res === false) {
        throw new Exception (""Loading private key failed: "".openssl_error_string ());
        return false;
    }
    if (openssl_pkey_export ($res, $result, $new) === false) {
        throw new Exception (""Passphrase change failed: "".openssl_error_string ());
        return false;
    }
    return $result;
}

I hope you can follow what we've done here ... !  (Obviously the exception throwing is purely optional ... I've just pulled the code verbatim from my codebase.)
changePassphrase() takes the private key as a string, along with the current and new passphrases.  We use openssl_pkey_get_private() to retrieve a handle to the private key, unlocking it with the old passphrase.
(It's worth noting that the passphrase is literally used to encrypt the private key, which may sound a little double-dutch!  [Encrypting the encryption key ... ?!]  openssl_pkey_get_private() returns FALSE if it fails to interpret the key - i.e. if the passphrase is wrong, and the private key decrypts to an invalid value.  Make sense?)
Having unlocked the private key with the old passphrase, we take the OpenSSL key handle and pass it to openssl_pkey_export() - just like we did after creating it in the first place (via openssl_pkey_new()) providing the new passphrase ... and hey-presto.
I hope my code example reads cleanly, I've tried to write it in a fashion that's easy to understand and follow, without unnecessary ""compression"" and short-cutting.
Good luck!

","What you can do is something like this; Make a shared secret between multiple users using their pub/priv keys, then use that shared secret as the AES symetric key to unlock the data in mysql.
What this means is that you can utilize mysql's inbuilt AES encrypt function for convenience while still maintaining secure data given that you will never know the shared secret.

","There is no such algorithm as far as I know, but there is a common solution. The enciphered text is transferred together with a set of cryptograms of the symmetric key used to encipher the text itself. Each such cryptogram of the key is a result of enciphering the original key with the public key of one of recipients. Thus, all recipients knowing their private keys may decipher the key used to encipher the data and then decipher the message itself.

","You could use a symmetric encryption and secret sharing scheme on top of that, ""splitting the key in half"".
More on secret sharing: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing
Steps on how I see it:

Encrypt the data using (pseudo) randomly generated key.
Distribute the secret using Shamir's secret sharing which is the key to two shares, where as one share will suffice to get the key.

The end result is that one (or more) ""keys"" are required to get the data.

","Asymmetric keys are never used for encrypting messages (too slow, has a size limit, etc.), only for encrypting small buffers, like symmetric keys for messages. 
When you encrypt a message with an asymm. key, you are in fact encrypting a symmetric key which encrypts the message. 
Simply encrypt the same symmetric key with two different asymm. keys and you'd get two different cipherblocks which both contain the same symmetric key for the message, so you can decrypt with either one.

","A reminder that security is unusually treacherous territory, and if there's a way to call on other well-tested code even more of your toplevel task than just what Go's OpenPGP package is handling for you, consider it. It's good that at least low-level details are outsourced to openpgp because they're nasty and so so easy to get wrong. But tiny mistakes at any level can make crypto features worse than useless; if there's a way to write less security-critical code, that's one of the best things anyone can do for security.
On the specific question: you have to Close() the writer to get everything flushed out (a trait OpenPGP's writer shares with, say, compress/gzip's). 
Unrelated changes: the way you're printing things is a better fit log.Println, which just lets you pass a bunch of values you want printed with spaces in between (like, say, Python print), rather than needing format specifiers like ""%s"" or ""%d"". (The ""EXTRA"" in your initial output is what Go's Printf emits when you pass more things than you had format specifiers for.) It's also best practice to check errors (I dropped if err != nils where I saw a need, but inelegantly and without much thought, and I may not have gotten all the calls) and to run go fmt on your code.

","You need to base64 encode the NSData before sending to php. See the answer for the following post:
Creating a base-64 string from NSData
On php end, you can use openssl_private_decrypt to decrypt. Reference below:
http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-private-decrypt.php
Sample:
<?php
$fp=fopen(""/path/to/private_key.pem"",""r"");
$priv_key=fread($fp,8192);
fclose($fp);
$res = openssl_get_privatekey($priv_key, ""myPassword"");

$data = $_POST['encrypted_string']; 
if (openssl_private_decrypt(base64_decode($data), $decrypted, $res))
         echo ""Decrypted:$decrypted"";

","The public key need no security, so you can save as clear text in the database.
with the private key you have different solution based on level of security and kinds of attacks you want to avoid.
1
save the pk as clear text in the db. Never write php code that echo the pk
2
save the pk in p12 format protect it with a password. You can prompt the password to the user every time you need
3
generete, store and use the pk using a HSM http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module

I have a JWT from Azure and now I need verify the signature in my application.
The public keys from Microsoft can be found here:
https://login.windows.net/common/discovery/keys
How do I use these keys to verify a signature? I can tell these these are the public keys I need as the X5T header in the JWT matches those on this public key list.
I am using the JWT PHP library but everything I enter as the public key seems to fail.
supplied key param cannot be coerced into a public key

So using the link above, that goes from there into the PHP
openssl_verify function as parameter three ($key in the example below)?
$success = openssl_verify($msg, $signature, $key, 'SHA256')

Everything I enter causes an error in one way or another.
Thanks,
","Problem solved.
Turns out that the X5C part of the JSON array is the certificate not public key so JSON decoding https://login.windows.net/common/discovery/keys and grabbing the X5C element and using openssl to derive the public key works:
$cert_object = openssl_x509_read($cert);

$pkey_object = openssl_pkey_get_public(cert_object);

$pkey_array = openssl_pkey_get_details($pkey_object);

$publicKey = $pkey_array ['key'];

In this example $cert is the X5C value. However this on its own is not enough as its not encoded to X509. So what I did is create a new file in windows called certificate.cer, open in notepad and put the X5C value in there. Then by double clicking on ther .cer in windows, navigating to the details tab and clicking ""copy to file"" this opens the certificate export wizard.
Export as X509 and upload to the server.
$cert = file_get_contents('Certificates/Public/public.cer');

Works! There is probably a simpler way but this works.

"9675425","Public Key encryption with .NET and decryption with Java","I have a requirement where a Java Web service exposes methods for clients to obtain a PublickKey (as a PEM String) and submit data to the web service encrypted by the PublicKey. The client of the service is .NET app. On the Java side a keystore is created with a keypair (RSA 1024 bits) as shown below
keytool.exe -genkey -alias abc -keystore sample.ks -storetype jceks -storepass xyz
The .NET client obtains the PublicKey via the webservice and then use that public Key to encrypt some sensitive data to call the web service with the encrypted data. The web service decrypts the data using the private key avavailable from keystore and stores the contents in the DB. I cannot use any WS-Security capabilities for client compatibility reasons.
The webservice reads the keystore and returns the Public Key as a PEM string.
The .NET Client gets the PublicKey as a PEM string and creates a RSACryptoServiceProvider using this and it works without any issues. It then ecrypts the data and submits it back to the Java webservice. 
The Java Service decrypts the data but the problem I have is that it prints out garbage (not ASCII data).I don't get any exceptions.
I have attached the snippets (simplified) of code here
.NET Client Side
  var registrationService = new RegistrationService();
  var pKey = registrationService.getPublickey();
  //pKey is a PEM String
  X509Certificate2 cert = new X509Certificate2(ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(pKey));

    RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = (RSACryptoServiceProvider)cert.PublicKey.Key;

    var encryptedMsg = rsa.Encrypt(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(""Secret Data""), false);
    var encoded_msg = Convert.ToBase64String(encryptedMsg);

    registrationService.submitRegistration(encoded_msg);

Java Side:
   public void submitRegistration(String inputData)
   {
   //Decoding the encoded and encrypted message in the webservice      
   PrivateKey privateKey = getPrivateKeyFromKeyStore(""abc"");
   //I know I am using JDK proprietary classes, but I can easily replace this
   byte[] dataInBytes = new Base64Decoder().deodeBuffer(inputData)

   Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/ECB/NoPadding""); 
   cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, privateKey);
   byte[] decryptedData = cipher.doFinal(dataInBytes);          
   String original = new String(decryptedData, ""UTF-8"");
   System.out.println(""Original Data : "" + original);
}
  public String getPublicKey()
  {
    Certificate cert = getKeyStore().getCertificate(""abc"");
    byte[] encodedCert = cert.getEncoded();
    StringWriter sw = new StringWriter();
    sw.write(""-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----"");
    sw.write(new Base64Encoder().encode(encodedCert));
    sw.write(""-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"");
    return sw.toString();
  }

","One thing to notice is that you're using ""NOPADDING"" on the Java side but .NET is using PKCS1Padding.  
Since PKCS1 padding pads plaintext with 0x00 0x02 at the high order end this also provides a way for the decrypting side to check that it is using a correct private key. However, note that the chance of a wrong key decrypting to plaintext that starts with 0x00 0x02 is at least 1/65536, so this check cannot be relied on entirely to detect an incorrect private key. In your case, you used an incorrect key and the plaintext failed this check, so you received the exception. Now, when you specify NOPADDING you are saying that all plaintext are valid, and any further checking will be done by your application.

","Who passes what key to whom? (Also, traditionally P for plaintext and C for ciphertext.)
And there's an easy answer (unless I'm misunderstanding you, which is an obvious possibility since your question isn't very clear): Give each recipient ""half"" of the key in the first place, and the other half when you want them to be able to decrypt the message.
How do you split a key in half? A decent way is to XOR it with a nonce: give person 1 K⊕N1 and person 2 K⊕N2. When you want them to decrypt the message, give them N1 or N2 respectively.
Another easy answer is to just give each person the key encrypted with the recipient's public key when you want them to decrypt the message.

A plain text file (T) was shared among two parties, this file was encrypted (let say symmetric AES) to become encrypted file (E). The Encrypted file will be stored in the server, and after encryption takes place, additional party can be added at any time. 
When first party wants to get the T file, he/she passes P1K to decrypt E file
when second party wants to get the T file, he/she passed P2K to decrypt E file.
Any idea how to achieve this using pure encryption algorithm only (without using database to store intermediary key) ?
","The plain text (T) can be encrypted with a secret key (Ks) using a symmetric cipher like AES.
Ks is encrypted with as many public keys that is allowed to know the symmetric cipher and added as part of the encrypted message packet.
Decryption just means iterating through the list of encrypted Ks against the private key of a user.

So in a one step of this implementation sensor nodes have a certificate of a CA. Sensors are supposed to generate a symmetric key and encrypt it with CA's public key and send it to the CA. 
I use openssl for certificate and key generations. I though of using AES with 128bit key for the symmetric key. The problem for the moment is that I can't encrypt 128bit data as follows since it gives ""Data is too large"" error.
openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey id_rsa.pub.pem -pubin -in key1.bin -out key1.bin.enc

This is how I generate keys.

Thank you 
","From the openssl rsautl documentation page:

rsautl because it uses the RSA algorithm directly can only be used to
  sign or verify small pieces of data.

So don't expect to be able to encrypt large amounts of data with an RSA key.
HOWEVER, the RSA algorithm is frequently used to do exactly what you are proposing...encrypting an AES key, which is then used to encrypt larger files.
You should be able to encrypt (almost) up to your public key size.  So something seems wrong here.   For a public key size of 2048 bits (256 bytes), I can encrypt a 1960 bit (245 byte) file using the same openssl command in your question.  For a 1024 bit public key, I can encrypt 936 bits (117 bytes).
So let's check these items to see if the problem can be found:
First, how large is your RSA public key? (Be careful not to confuse bits and bytes.)  It should be 1024 bits or higher.
Next, how large is your AES key? (Again, make sure to check bits vs. bytes.)  It should be 128 bits according to your question.
If the sizes are correct for both keys, there should be no problem encrypting the AES key with the RSA key.

What is special for a private key to be PEM-formatted?

PEM is a presentation encoding. It has the familiar -----BEGIN XXX----- and -----END XXX-----.
I think BEGIN PRIVATE KEY is a PKCS #8 private key. Perhaps the library wants a PKCS #1 private key with BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY. BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY is also known as a Traditional key encoding (as opposed to PKCS #8).
You should check the relevant documentation and provide the key in the correct format.
To convert from a traditional key to a PKCS #8 key, see the OpenSSL man pages for pkcs(1). -topk8 is of interest. Also see How to convert PKCS#8-formatted PEM private key to the tranditional format?

","Having examined the PyJWT source code, it is apparent that the library expects the PEM data to be a string type, but you are providing a bytestring (evident in your question by the b'...' literal).
The offending function is prepare_key, along with the definition of acceptable string types.

","At least in a typical public key encryption algorithm (e.g., RSA) there's not really a major difference between the public and the private key. When you generate keys, you get two keys. You keep one private and publish the other -- but it doesn't matter much which one you publish and which one you keep private. 
Anything you encrypt with one key can be decrypted with the other key. For normal purposes, you publish one key, which lets anybody encrypt something that only you can decrypt. From a technical viewpoint, the reverse works fine though: if you encrypt something with your private key, anybody with the public key can decrypt it. This is typically used for things like signature verification (i.e., anybody with the public key can verify that the signature had to have been created with the private key). You usually want to use separate key pairs for encryption and signing though.
For your case, it's open to some question what you're really going to accomplish. You can certainly encrypt some data necessary to use the program, so the user needs the key to decrypt it and use the program -- but if the user is willing to give a copy of the code to an unauthorized person, they probably won't hesitate at giving a copy of the key to them as well. As such, even though the encryption/decryption will do it's job, it's unlikely to provide any real protection.
A more typical licensing scheme is tied to something like a specific IP address, so you do something like encrypting the IP address, then use the result as a key to decrypt data necessary to use the program. If the IP address is wrong, the data isn't decrypted correctly, and the program doesn't work. As long as the user has a static IP address this can work well -- but will cause problems in conjunction with DHCP.
My immediate advice would to just not do this at all. If you insist on doing it anyway, don't do it yourself -- get something like FlexNet to handle it for you. You're better off without it, but at least this way you'll get something that sort of works, and you won't waste time and effort on it that could be put to better purposes like improving your software.

","Congratulations, you just invented the RSA signature.  (Which is what you should be using, anyway.)  To communicate with a public key system, you need to use the private key once and the public key once, but RSA supports two different orders:
1) Encrypt with the public key, decrypt with the private: The recipient doesn't know anything about the source of the message, but the sender knows that only the recipient (the holder of the private key) can read it.  This is classical ""encryption"".
2) ""Encrypt"" with the private key, then ""decrypt"" with the public.  This is a digital signature, and provides authentication.  Anyone can read the message, but only the private key holder could have sent it.
Assuming your license is customized to the client (which could be as simple as including a copy of a client-generated random number), then it's useless to anyone else, but the client can be sure that the server sent it.
The symmetry isn't quite that neat in practice; the different modes of operation have different weaknesses and gotchas, so the implementation is typically significantly different, but that's the general idea.
One of the first and most important lessons in cryptology is understanding authentication and when to use it.  It's needed at least as often as encryption, and not knowing when to use it leaves you in a Midvale School for the Gifted situation.

","Partial dupe Load RSA public key from file 
So, you 'wrote' (I assume, copied) code that clearly says you need two files, in DER form, containing PKCS8 and 'X509' encodings. (What Java calls X.509 here is really the SubjectPublicKeyInfo component of X.509.) You give it one file, in PEM form not DER, containing a PKCS1 encoding not PKCS8 or X509 -- and you're surprised it doesn't work? Python works because it calls OpenSSL, and OpenSSL supports over a dozen encodings and formats for privatekeys, including this one; Java supports only one (outside of keystores) which isn't this one. (Bare) publickeys are a little better; internally libcrypto supports multiple forms, but in practice only two of them are used, and one of them matches Java -- although many publickeys are distributed, stored, and used in the form of X.509 certificates, which provides several more forms to worry about.
There are approximately 7 solutions to your situation:

the simplest is to use OpenSSL commandline to convert your one file to the two files Java wants:
# (corrected! pkey is inconsistent!) 
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in input.pem -outform der -out private.der

openssl pkey -in input.pem -pubout -outform der -out public.der
# or for very old versions (should not be needed now)
openssl rsa -in input.pem -pubout -outform der -out public.der

Those files can now be read by the code you posted (except with the filenames separated). Note this conversion doesn't have to be done on the same system; if necessary you can do it elsewhere and copy the files, if you use a method that works for binary files i.e. NOT cut&paste.
if you really want only one file, but it can be converted, create the private.der file as above and read it with only the privatekey-related parts of your code, then do:
RSAPrivateCrtKey priv2 = (RSAPrivateCrtKey)privKey;
PublicKey pubkey = keyFactory.generatePublic(new RSAPublicKeySpec(priv2.getModulus(), priv2.getPublicExponent()));

you could convert the files to PKCS8 and 'X509' PEM by omitting -outform der from the above conversions, then read those files and manually 'de-PEM' by removing the header and trailer lines and converting the base64 to binary (removing or skipping the linebreaks); this results in binary PKCS8 and X509 encodings you can run through your existing code. This is as much work on the openssl side and more work on the Java side so there is no apparent advantage, except that PEM files are valid text and can be cut&pasted if necessary. 
combining these, you could convert to PKCS8 PEM only, read that per bullet 3 (de-PEM then the privatekey parts of your code), then extract publickey from privatekey per bullet 2 
one way to use the format you have (unconverted) in plain Java is to de-PEM per bullet 3 giving you a PKCS1 encoding, then manually construct the PKCS8 encoding, then proceed as before to run the PKCS8 through the KeyFactory and extract publickey per bullet 2. See my answer at Java: Convert DKIM private key from RSA to DER for JavaMail for a really ugly way to do this (including one de-PEM method). There is a better way if you use BouncyCastle (which has a class for this ASN.1 type), but if you use BouncyCastle it's better not to use this method at all, see below.
another way to use the unconverted format in plain Java is to de-PEM per bullet 3, then parse the ASN.1 structure of PKCS1 and construct an RSAPrivateCrtKeySpec which you can run through your KeyFactory instead of a PKCS8 encoding then extract publickey per bullet 2. This is even more complicated, although I think I have seen it somewhere; will add if I find it. Again BouncyCastle can improve this method, but doesn't need to, see below.
finally, if you have BouncyCastle it's dead easy. You don't say what you tried with 'no luck', but the following BouncyCastle code is all you need and does work:
try( Reader r = new FileReader(filename) ){
  KeyPair pair = new JcaPEMKeyConverter().getKeyPair((PEMKeyPair)new PEMParser(r).readObject());
}

Note this gives you a KeyPair with both privatekey and publickey objects from the one file.

"43357295","Looking for an example to load/use a public ssh key with pysftp","I am working on a script in python using pysftp to establish an sftp connection. This script will run in Windows (Server 2012R2). The version of pysftp I have installed requires a host key, so I contacted my vendor and have acquired the public key from them. What I can't figure out is how to use this public key in my pysftp connection. I understand in pysftp 0.2.9 there is a new property (remote_server_key) but I can't find any examples of how to use it, and I can't use cnopts.hostkeys = none
Does anyone have an example of how to use/integrate a specific public key for the sftp server/host?
Please note this is not about the private key/public pair for my connection (I have those keys and they work fine) - this is about the host's public key.
","Ok, so I'm going to ""answer"" this with a workaround. What I ended up doing was creating the equivalent of the known_hosts file in the ""expected"" location for paramiko/pysftp.
First you generate a known_hosts file. The simple parameters are the FQDN (or IPaddress) of the sftp host and the public key of the server you are connecting to.
Example:
sftp.myserver.com ssh-rsa AAB3nzawerdvDLGiyasdf...

Once you have that file created (and named known_hosts) use an elevated command prompt or powershell session to create a .ssh directory at the root of the home directory of the user who will be running the script.
cd c:\Users\serviceaccount

md .ssh

Then copy the known_hosts file into that directory.
Now set up your pysftp session:
import pysftp
cnopts = pysftp.CnOpts()
sftpConnect = pysftp.Connection(host=""sftp.myserver.com"", username=""myusername"", private_key=""c:\\path\to\my\openssh.key"", private_key_pass=""randompassword"", port=22, cnopts=cnopts)

That worked for me just now.

I would like this data to be encrypted. I want the program to start automatically at boot time, so I don't want to type a password at program start. I also don't want it to store a password somewhere, since that would almost defeat the purpose of encryption.
For these reasons, it seems to me that public key encryption would be a good choice. The program knows my public key, but my private key is password protected somewhere else.
So far, so good. But when I try to use PyCrypto to RSA (or ElGamal)-encrypt a small 5-byte string, the output explodes to 128 bytes. My logfiles are large enough as it is... On the other hand, when I try a symmetric crypto, like Blowfish, the output string is just as large as the input string.
So, my question is: Is there a reasonably secure public key encryption algorithm where I can encrypt data 8 bytes at a time and don't have it blow up? (I guess a factor of 2 would be OK). I think what I want is a public key stream cipher.
If there is not such a thing, I think I will just give up and use a symmetric crypto and give the password manually on startup.
","Typically this is solved in the way that the program creates some (real) random numbers which are used as a secret key to a symmetric encryption algorithm.
In you program you have to do something like:

Generate some real random data (maybe use /dev/random) as a secret key.
Encrypt the secret key with the public key algorithm.
Use the secret key for some other symmetric algorithm.

To decrypt this, 

Use the private key to decrypt the secret key.
Use the secret key and the symmetric algorithm to decrypt the data.

I'm using a browsified version of node-rsa on my client browser.
First at the client i generate a keypair and export the keys, storing them as strings
var NodeRSA = require('node-rsa');
var key = new NodeRSA({b: 1024});
key.exportKey(""pkcs8-private"");
key.exportKey(""pkcs8-public-pem"");

The exported private key is stored at the client and the public at the server
Next i used java to encrypt a string with the public key received, so i parse the pkcs8 public key into a Java PublicKey object.
String pubKey = ""<Retrieved pkcs8 public key>"";
pubKey = pubKey.replaceAll(""(-+BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-+\\r?\\n|-+END PUBLIC KEY-+\\r?\\n?)"", """");
byte[] keyBytes = Base64.decodeBase64(pubKey);
X509EncodedKeySpec spec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(keyBytes);
KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
PublicKey pk = kf.generatePublic(spec);

And encrypt a text with it
byte[] cipherText;
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, pk);
cipherText = cipher.doFinal(""Hello World!"".getBytes());
return Base64.encodeBase64String(cipherText);

Then i try to decrypt it the string at the client side
First i reimport the stored keys in node-rsa
var NodeRSA = require('node-rsa');
var key = new NodeRSA();
key.importKey(""<exported private key string>"",""pkcs8-private"");
key.importKey(""<exported public key string>"",""pkcs8-public-pem"");

Then i try to decrypt the Base64 encoded encrypted string
key.decrypt(""<Base64 Encoded Encrypted>"", 'utf-8');

This is where the problem happens, javascript throws this error

Uncaught Error: Error during decryption (probably incorrect key). Original error: Error: Error decoding message, the lHash calculated from the label provided and the lHash in the encrypted data do not match.(…)
  However i have tested that if i encrypt and decrypt the text just within javascript, it works just fine. This makes me think that it's some difference between the way i encrypted it at java and how it's done at javascript

Could anyone point out the mistake that I've made here please?
","Oh i found the solution. It was a difference in the encryption method.

I went through the source code of com.sun.crypto.provider.RSACipher and sun.security.rsa.RSAPadding and found the error is being thrown in the sun.security.rsa.RSAPadding.unpadV15 method due to the second bit not being set properly. I am also using the new NIO2 classes in Java7 specifically the AsychronousSocketChannel and CompletionHandler objects so I don't know if they are causing threading errors though I highly doubt it. I found the source code at http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/6-b14/com/sun/crypto/provider/RSACipher.java and http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/7-b147/sun/security/rsa/RSAPadding.java#RSAPadding.padV15%28byte[]%29 but again they didn't help me much. I have tried dropping the key size and changing the encoding/padding options of the cipher objects, but it always errors out even with padding disabled. Though it may not matter, but since I am using JRE7, there is no stable support for bouncycastle so I am using the default security provider.

","No. The public key is not used to decrypt, but to encrypt. You decrypt with your private key. That way, only you can decrypt the message.
Usually though, private-public key encryption is too expensive to encrypt data with. You'd use a private/public encryption scheme to exchange a shared key (large random number) to encrypt your data with.
Example: Alice creates a private/public keypair, sends the public key to Bob. Bob creates a large random number and encrypts it with Alice's public key. Alice can decrypt that and find the large random number. Alice and Bob then use the random number to encrypt their data stream.
As additional security, you could change keys periodically.

Why RSA alone does not fit with Matt's situation?

In Matt's situation, he want both of 2 computers to be ensured legal. My point is RSA can only ensure 1 of them legal, instead of both of them.
Another important thing is cracker CAN also use private key to encrypt and public key to decrypt. The key can make client know it was connecting to a ""legal"" server, but can't help server to ensure it's a ""legal"" client since key stored at client side or send from server can be leaked. A better solution is implement your own hash algorithm to prevent being hacked. 
Here is an article about RSA private key encryption:
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/38739/RSA-Private-Key-Encryption
Let's think about bank website, the client should know he is on legal website, but bank server doesn't need to ensure the client is legal or not since mobile phone authentication and other methods can do the trick. The mobile phone authentication is just something like ""hash method"", so, hash method is a must. RSA alone can not ensure safety.
Without hash method, if a cracker gets key stored, or transmitted by Internet, he can easily make a fake client without any difficulties. 

Well, then what's your solution?

Since I'm implementing a Client-Server based software, I can share you my solution:

I saved private key into Client's source code.
When server send some response or client send some request, use private/public key to encrypt and decrypt by the other side.
You need some protection, like code obfuscation to protect the key stored in client.
You need to design an hash algorithm to ensure data sent by client is legal. The hacker might get your key finally, but hard to know what your algorithm is so it's still safe enough.
Hash algorithm means an algorithm combined with add some salt/SHA-1/UUID/timestamp...etc. I don't mean you should invent a new encrypt algorithm.

For example, if the plain text is I'm so awesome
The algorithm can be:
Result = SHA1(salt + plain text + timestamp + anything you like)
If find your algorithm leaked, just change some key values.

What if your hash algorithm leaked?

Remember there's no algorithm can not be hacked. We don't need to build a castle can not be destroyed, we just need to make out enemy pay hard.
Still, you also need a quick ""big red button"" if anything goes wrong. Hash algorithm can play this role quite easy, a small modification can make crackers pay lots of time to hack it out. That's already good enough. 

UPDATE:

Is SSL equivalent to public-key encryption? Should I use it instead?

Yes, but you still have to store key somewhere better than send it through network. HTTPS/TLS is another decent choice.

","There are many different formats to represent RSA public keys. One of the more wide-spread ones is PKCS#1. In RFC 3447, the definition of the public key format is given as
  RSAPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
      modulus           INTEGER,  -- n
      publicExponent    INTEGER   -- e
  }

To represent a key in that format, you need to apply the ASN.1 DER encoding to this data structure.
Another choice is the SubjectPublicKeyInfo, from RFC 3280:
  SubjectPublicKeyInfo  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
     algorithm            AlgorithmIdentifier,
     subjectPublicKey     BIT STRING  
  }

For RSA, the algorithm should be 1.2.840.113549.1.1.1.
There are several other formats, such as the ones used for SSL.

","In brief: 
the data is encrypted using symmetric algorithm and a random symmetric key. Then the random key is encrypted using public asymmetric key. The encrypted random key is stored together with the encrypted data. To decrypt the data one uses private asymmetric key to decrypt the stored random key, then the decrypted random key is used to decrypt the data.
256-bit is the length of the key. However, it has dramatically different meaning for symmetric and asymmetric keys. For symmetric keys 256 bits are a very strong key (you can have even longer keys with AES 384 or AES 512 where the numbers specify the key length the algorithm operates with). For asymmetric algorithms 256 bits is nothing, and comparable strength is 2048 bits. 
Public key encryption can be implemented using any language, that supports math operations and arrays. However, doing this is reinventing the wheels. There exists a number of cross-platform libraries for PKI: open-source OpenSSL for C++, BouncyCastle for Java and some more. Our company offers a supported and maintained SecureBlackbox product for .NET, Windows and Linux (MacOS X version to come soon).
Also there's a couple of books about PKI that we recommend to all our users. RSA's guide is an easy reading (but very useful) and the second book goes into deeper details.

Thanks for any help regarding this!
EDIT: I'm using code from: http://blog.flirble.org/2011/01/05/rsa-public-key-openssl-ios/ to use the public key i get from the server (this is where ""keyRefs"" from the code snippet comes from)
","Of course, the public key is something someone else uses to encrypt data so that only someone with the private key can decrypt it.
The very definition of a public key is that you can give it to anyone.  You wouldn't want anyone to be able to decrypt anyone else's encrypted message would you?
It is impossible to tell from your code fragment where your private key is stored, or what the contents (or even class) of keyRefs is.
EDIT:  In response to above OP's comment. And clarification.
*""The public key itself is the public part of a RSA-key-pair stored on the server. The encrypted message was created on the server by first JSON-encoding the object, then encrypted with the private-key with OPENSSL_PKCS1_PADDING, then base64-encoded, and then JSON-encoded again as a part of the final message. The message and public key is stored on the client. What i want is to decrypt the message on the client by using the public key. As i said, im not very good at this subject so i might have tried to do this the wrong way""*
Thats not how public key cryptography works.  The server and client exchange public keys.  Then each of them use the other's public key to encrypt data sent to the opposite party. The receiving party always uses their own private key to decrypt the message.
If you want the server to generate an encrypted response, have the client pass their public key in the request, use that public key to encrypt the response, and then decrypt the response on the client with the client's private key.

","I'm not sure what parts are confusing you, or what exactly you are trying to achieve. KeyStore can only hold three types of entries: symmetric keys, private keys, and certificates. Therefore, if you want to store a public key it must be formatted into a certificate. Whether your application uses any of the other features of X509 certificates is up to you. 
It's also not clear if you want to use any old keystore on Android, or the AndroidKeyStore. The latter offers enhanced features, but whether you need them or not is dependent on your threat model. In any event, here is an example that shows how to import a google public key into the Android Keystore, how to set some properties on it, and how to use it to encrypt an AES key.

","RSA with 8-bit key :)
Seriously though, the block-based cyphers are stateless - the ciphertext of a block depends only on the cleartext of the block, not on the previous blocks (otherwise it would be a stream cypher). A block cypher that acts on 8-bit blocks can be brute-forced easily, so there's no point.

","A block cipher with 8-bit blocks means that each input block can be encrypted into 256 possible values -- which means that an attacker has a 1/256 chance of guessing the input value. It turns out to be very difficult to use such an algorithm securely. Nevertheless it is possible to define a block cipher over 8-bit blocks, and to do it ""perfectly""; just do not expect it to be generally useful.
There also are ""block-less"" ciphers, known as ""stream ciphers"" which encrypt data ""byte by byte"" (or even ""bit by bit""); most are just pseudo-random generators which produce an arbitrary amount of bytes from a key. That generated stream is just to be combined with the data to encrypt with a XOR. The traditional stream cipher is RC4; but newer and better stream ciphers have been designed.
A block cipher, by itself, is a mathematical tool. In order to actually encrypt data, the block cipher must be used properly. The keywords are chaining and padding. Chaining is about defining what actually goes into the block cipher and what to do with the output. Padding is about adding some bytes to the data, in a reversible way, so that the padded message length is appropriate for the chosen chaining mode. The traditional chaining mode is  called CBC. A newer (and arguably better) chaining mode is CTR (same link), which has the added bonus of avoiding the need for padding (CTR just turns a block cipher into a stream cipher).
As for block ciphers, you should use AES instead of TripleDES. It is faster, more secure, and the current American standard.

I am sure I coded everything right except for one line I was not sure about. I did not know how to solve for the private key in the RSA, and just winged it (I saw someone code 

d = e.modInverse(m);

where d is the private key, e is the public key, and m is (p-1)*(q-1). I dont understand how the modInverse method works though. long story short, how do you actually solve for the 'd' without having 2 unknowns in the same equation (I saw some equations given that said:

d = 1/(e % m);

I refrained from posting results just because the number returned is about as big as the encrypted message.

","I imagine the problem is the url to your repo.  It needs to be adjusted to use the alias created in your ~/.ssh/config:
git remote set-url origin git@bitbucket:path/to/repo.git

Additionally, you could make your ~/.ssh/config look like this:
ServerAliveInterval 15
ServerAliveCountMax 3

Host bitbucket
 HostName bitbucket.org
 User git
 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/bitbucket

Note the presence of the User key.  That will tell ssh that whenever you use the alias bitbucket to also use the user name git.  The above command can then become:
git remote set-url origin bitbucket:path/to/repo.git

Additionally, whenever you clone, you can do:
git clone bitbucket:path/to/repo.git

The answer is to encrypt the data with a symmetric algorithm such as AES which is designed to encrypt small and large data.
If an RSA public/private key pair are required encrypt the symmetric (AES) key with RSA. This is referred to as hybrid encryption and in essence is hoe HTTPS encrypts data.
But it is may not necessary to RSA encrypt the symmetric key unless a public/private key pair are required. In the general case one just uses symmetric (AES) and that key. What is the use case for a public/private key pair?

p = 115792089210356248762697446949407573530086143415290314195533631308867097853951

with y²= x³ -3x + b (mod p)
As far as I understand it I use

p for setFieldFP(), prime p corresponding to the field GF(p)
r for setR(), order of the fixed point G of the curve,
b for setB(), second coefficient of the curve,
Gx and Gy for setG(), fixed point of the curve (after encoding them as ANSI X9.62),
cofactor of the order of the fixed point G is 1, so setK(1)

The coefficient A is -3 (according to the definition of the curve). But how do I have to encode -3 (as a byte[]), so that I can set it with setA()?
","Since calculation is done modulo p, you are free to add p whereever you please. 
a = -3 -> a= -3 + p -> a = p - 3

"8660158","RSA encryption in .Net using the public key from SQL Server?","I would like to perform some encryption on client using the asymmetric key stored and generated in SQL Server.
I can get the public key from the DMV using the following query:
SELECT public_key FROM sys.asymmetric_keys WHERE name = 'KeyName'

This returns the following value:

0x06020000002400005253413100020000010001008B656455D4C56392C45EEC3563203635F5F42DDA57069E7A880BF0AF055174A2A165DED75BA4E73E2A09BCBFAA50042B4E27354C1FEB3361F81C381AFF59A6A7

How can I use this binary value as public key for RSA_512 encryption in .Net? I have searched through similar questions here but failed to find any appropriate solution: I either need the key in XML form or at least to know .Modulus and .Exponent of the public key. Can I get it from these binary sequence?

EDIT:
Here is my code
   SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(string.Format(""SELECT dbo.GetKey(@KeyName)"", conn);
   cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@KeyName"", ConfigurationManager.AppSettings.Get(""PublicKeyName""));
   PublicKey = (byte[]) cmd.ExecuteScalar();

   var rsa=new System.Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider(Convert.ToInt32(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings.Get(""KeyLength"")));
   rsa.ImportCspBlob(PublicKey);
   EncryptedData = rsa.Encrypt(Data,false);

I get the exception ""Key not valid"" in the last line.
","Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa=new Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider(512);
rsa.ImportCspBlob(keyblob)

with keyblob being a byte[] representation of the above key.

1) generate a key
openssl genrsa -out ./private.pem 2048
2) generate a public key
openssl rsa -in ./private.pem -pubout > ./public.pem
3) encrypt a small text file
openssl enc -in ./in.txt  -out ./out.enc  -e -aes256 -k ./public.pem
4) decrypt file using PUBLIC key
openssl enc -in ./out.enc  -out ./out.txt  -d -aes256 -k ./public.pem

","No. That's wrong. The two keys (public and private) can be used for BOTH encrypting and decrypting. The kicker is that you cannot reverse the operation with the same key.
e.g.
encrypt(doc, publickey) -> decrypt(crypteddoc, publickey)  // fails
encrypt(doc, privatekey) -> decrypt(crypteddoc, privatekey) // fails

encrypt(doc, publickey) -> decrypt(crypteddoc,privatekey) // works
encrypt(doc, privatekey) -> decrypt(crypteddoc, publickey) // works

Technically, it doesn't matter which key you share and make public, as long as once you have made one of the keys public, you cannot ever share the other, private, key.

","For those of you still having trouble:
Until a fully packaged official build of xampp is released with the next version of apache which should fix this bug, I have successfully fixed this issue by changing my version of Apache to one found here: http://www.apachelounge.com/download/ This fixes the bug but still allows me to use OpenSSL
The second Apache 2.2.4 download on this page was built specifically to fix this bug. For me it was easy as:

Stopping Apache
Renaming xampp\apache to xampp\apacheold just in case it broke. 
Copied in the Apache24 to xampp\Apache24 from the downloaded zip
Renamed it to apache
Copied the .bat files from the xampp\apacheold folder into the new xampp\apache folder.
Replaced the xampp\apache\conf folder with the one from xampp\apacheold
Start Apache again

",".NET Core (or Framework) does not have a built-in way to load bare key files.  
You have a couple of options:

Wrap the public key up into a certificate and use cert.GetRSAPublicKey()
Use openssl rsa -in text/publicKey.key -text -noout to copy all of the hex values for each of the fields, and import them directly into an RSAParameters structure (then call rsa.ImportParameters(rsaParams))
Study ITU-T X.680 (ASN.1), ITU-T X.690 (DER), PKCS#1 (RSA), and RFC 7486 (if you want to read PEM-encoded keys) to read the key file, then parse it into an RSAParameters structure, and use rsa.ImportParameters(rsaParams).

It's worth noting that this has been identified as a gap in .NET and is currently marked for .NET Core 2.1 (though it's always possible it doesn't make it): https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/20414.

","A smartcard is just a chip on a card, so you probably want to ask about cryptographic smart cards.
I have never worked with cryptographic smart cards but that sounds like a completely reasonable functionality of such smartcards since they are intended usually for authentication and encryption which usally use private keys for that.
The advantage of cryptographic smart cards usually lies in that, that the private key is stored in it. That is intended to prevent the compromise of the keys because even if the computer, that reads the smartcard, is compromised the smartcard is safe and the private key is safe too.

","Most cryptographic smart cards are able to generate keys in the card in addition to storing externally generated plaintext keys, that's the main purpose of cryptographic smart cards. 
Some cards don't allow importing plaintext keys, some allow exporting keys generated on the card, some card can do import/export of wrapped (encrypted with another key) private keys, so that the actual private key would never be in clear in an untrusted environment.
Have a look at http://www.opensc-project.org for a further pointers on cards and software.

","How I resolved:
Root cause of this issue was that sunpkcs11 provider was getting loaded both statically and dynamically.
i.e.
in java.security, provider entry along with cfg path was already added.
Also, in code, provider was initialized again with the cfg file.
This was causing the issue.
After changing:
SunPKCS11 provider = new SunPKCS11(""/home/user/pkcs11.cfg"");

TO:
SunPKCS11 sunPKCS11Provider = (SunPKCS11) Security.getProvider(""SunPKCS11"");

issue got resolved.

","Don't encrypt your SSNs, hash them
It sounds like you should be hashing the SSNs rather than encrypting them. The difference between the two is that hashing is one-way while encryption is not. But as you don't need to verify the value of the data, just the integrity, I would definitely use hashing because

Hashing is more secure than encryption as hashed SSNs can not be unhashed
Hashing still allows you to verify the integrity of the data and check for duplicate SSNs in your database.

How to hash
If you're using PHP 5 >= 5.5.0, I would strongly recommend using PHP's built in password hashing functions. It's battle tested and created for this very situation. It even auto generates its own secure salt (but still has the option of you providing your own).
Make sure you carefully read the documentation on password hashing functions, but a short example (taken from the docs' example) is below:
<?php
// To create the password hash:
$ssn = password_hash($ssn, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
// To verify the integrity of what the user is entering
// In this example, $hash is the hashed password generated from password_hash
if (password_verify('rasmuslerdorf', $hash)) {
    echo 'SSN is valid!';
} else {
    echo 'Invalid SSN.';
}
?>

Remember to check the docs on the password hashing functions so you correctly use them:

password_get_info
password_hash
password_needs_rehash
password_verify

","A little late to the game, but I took a two-pronged approach.
We split the SSN into two parts:

XXX-XX
3847

The first part of the SSN is encrypted using some encryption algorithm (blowfish?) or whatever flavor you choose. 
The database:
--------------------------------------------------------
| ID    |   SSN-A    |   SSN-B    | ......   |         |
--------------------------------------------------------
|   1   | N1maA+HCRj |    3847    |    ...   |         |
|   2   | HCRjHQiEx/ |    7254    |    ...   |         |
--------------------------------------------------------

When records are exported or dumped into a CSV for consumption by another entity, you can decrypt the first part of the SSN one by one and then reassemble the complete SSN.
As long as the key is stored securely, then there is a reasonable sense of security here. The added benefit of this is - while you cannot do a whole SSN search, you can at least limit them by using the last 4 digits. There is a whole set of regulations around storing SSN's, so whatever way you choose - be careful.
Edit
It would also probably be wise to name the columns something non deterministic of an SSN field.

I've broken down things as much as I can. I wrote some javascript to generate a keypair, print out the values private and public, encrypt a simple string and print it out as well.
I've copied the values straight to a simple php script. Trying to decode it with the values from the javascipt.
Encoding and decoding works properly in the javascript (as posted below), decoding in php does not (also posted beneath the javascript). I also can't seem to find where to set the SHA-512 declaration in PHP. Does anyone have experience with this kind of exchange and perhaps point me in the right direction.

","Guess I solved my own problem. I played around with phpseclib and got a hint about the hash being wrong. After replacing SHA-512 with SHA-1 it finally worked. In the PHP documentation its says that the crypt libe defaults to SHA-1. Things should have worked properly with phpseclib, being completely independent of the open_ssl php lib. But it didn't. Still at a loss why this happend. But at least I have a working solution to work from... Hope this helps other people working on the same thing.

"29615420","RSA-OAEP SHA-512 Encrypt / Decrypt from Javascriptwebcrypt api to PHP openssl?","I've been rather busy trying to get a secure exchange established between a browserclient, using the webcrypto api and PHP server using openssl. I've broken down things as much as I can. I wrote some javascript to generate a keypair, print out the values private and public, encrypt a simple string and print it out as well.
I've copied the values straight to a simple php script. Trying to decode it with the values from the javascipt.
Encoding and decoding works properly in the javascript (as posted below), decoding in php does not (also posted beneath the javascript). I also can't seem to find where to set the SHA-512 declaration in PHP. Does anyone have experience with this kind of exchange and perhaps point me in the right direction. RSA-OAEP was chosen because it's supported by chrome, mozilla, IE11 and Safari as well as PHP.
Kind regards,
Gideon

","Gideon,
Glad you found your answer. Your issue was not with PHP but with Safari, it does not support OAEP with anything other than SHA1, at least at this time.
If you are going to work with WebCrypto you may want to look at: https://peculiarventures.github.io/pv-webcrypto-tests/ which enumerates the combinations supported by each browser.
We did this as a test suite to help us build https://github.com/PeculiarVentures/webcrypto-liner which makes it easier to build interoperable WebCrypto applications.

Obtaining a SecKeyRef Object for Public Key Cryptography
  Extracting Keys from the Keychain If you are using existing public and private keys from your keychain, read Certificate, Key, and Trust Services Programming Guide to learn how to retrieve a SecKeychainItemRef object for that key.
  Once you have obtained a SecKeychainItemRef, you can cast it to a SecKeyRef for use with this API.
  Importing Existing Public and Private Keys Importing and exporting public and private key pairs is somewhat more complicated than generating new keys because of the number of different key formats in common use.
  This example describes how to import and export a key pair in PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) format.

"11106726","Bouncy castle error: Unable to cast object of type RsaPrivateCrtKeyParameters to type ElGamalKeyParameters","I am having difficulties with decryption of a GPG file using Bouncy Castle. I have the encrypted file and I have a private key and the password for the private key. I can successfully decrypt the file using the desktop software GPG4win Kleopatra so I have the correct private key and the gpg file is valid.
However when our application reaches the line of code which attempts to decrypt the data with Bouncy Castle, I receive this error:
Unable to cast object of type 'Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Parameters.RsaPrivateCrtKeyParameters' to type 'Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Parameters.ElGamalKeyParameters'.

I am decrypting the same file using the same private key with Kleopatra so this has got to be something I can resolve by perhaps changing the private key file to the expected format or setting some options in Bouncy Castle.
The private key file is a plain text file beginning with the lines:
-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----

","From experience, if you need to do something that doesn't look like it's supported by the iOS security framework then build and link your own copy of OpenSSL into your project.  Although iOS apparently uses OpenSSL internally, very little of it is exposed to application developers.
Grab one of the many OpenSSL-for-iOS projects out there, for example this one, and get going.  
Using OpenSSL directly has a number of advantages, a few of them being lots of sample code and on-line documentation at http://openssl.org, and you can pretty much do anything you need to that's crypto-related.
Update: there are now multiple versions of OpenSSL available via Cocopods: OpenSSL and OpenSSL-Universal which should make importing OpenSSL into your iOS or OSX project a lot easier.

        }

","Starting in .NET Core 3.0, this is (largely) built-in.
Writing SubjectPublicKeyInfo and RSAPrivateKey
.NET Core 3.0 built-in API
The output of the builtin API is the binary representation, to make them PEM you need to output the header, footer, and base64:
private static string MakePem(byte[] ber, string header)
{
    StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder(""-----BEGIN "");
    builder.Append(header);
    builder.AppendLine(""-----"");

    string base64 = Convert.ToBase64String(ber);
    int offset = 0;
    const int LineLength = 64;

    while (offset < base64.Length)
    {
        int lineEnd = Math.Min(offset + LineLength, base64.Length);
        builder.AppendLine(base64.Substring(offset, lineEnd - offset));
        offset = lineEnd;
    }

    builder.Append(""-----END "");
    builder.Append(header);
    builder.AppendLine(""-----"");
    return builder.ToString();
}

So to produce the strings:
string publicKey = MakePem(rsa.ExportSubjectPublicKeyInfo(), ""PUBLIC KEY"");
string privateKey = MakePem(rsa.ExportRSAPrivateKey(), ""RSA PRIVATE KEY"");

Semi-manually
If you can't use .NET Core 3.0, but you can use pre-release NuGet packages, you can make use of the prototype ASN.1 writer package (which is the same code that's used internally in .NET Core 3.0; it's just that the API surface isn't finalized).
To make the public key:
private static string ToSubjectPublicKeyInfo(RSA rsa)
{
    RSAParameters rsaParameters = rsa.ExportParameters(false);

    AsnWriter writer = new AsnWriter(AsnEncodingRules.DER);
    writer.PushSequence();

    writer.PushSequence();
    writer.WriteObjectIdentifier(""1.2.840.113549.1.1.1"");
    writer.WriteNull();
    writer.PopSequence();

    AsnWriter innerWriter = new AsnWriter(AsnEncodingRules.DER);

    innerWriter.PushSequence();
    WriteRSAParameter(innerWriter, rsaParameters.Modulus);
    WriteRSAParameter(innerWriter, rsaParameters.Exponent);
    innerWriter.PopSequence();

    writer.WriteBitString(innerWriter.Encode());

    writer.PopSequence();
    return MakePem(writer.Encode(), ""PUBLIC KEY"");
}

And to make the private key:
private static string ToRSAPrivateKey(RSA rsa)
{
    RSAParameters rsaParameters = rsa.ExportParameters(true);

    AsnWriter writer = new AsnWriter(AsnEncodingRules.DER);
    writer.PushSequence();

    writer.WriteInteger(0);
    WriteRSAParameter(writer, rsaParameters.Modulus);
    WriteRSAParameter(writer, rsaParameters.Exponent);
    WriteRSAParameter(writer, rsaParameters.D);
    WriteRSAParameter(writer, rsaParameters.P);
    WriteRSAParameter(writer, rsaParameters.Q);
    WriteRSAParameter(writer, rsaParameters.DP);
    WriteRSAParameter(writer, rsaParameters.DQ);
    WriteRSAParameter(writer, rsaParameters.InverseQ);

    writer.PopSequence();
    return MakePem(writer.Encode(), ""RSA PRIVATE KEY"");
}

Reading them back
.NET Core 3.0 built-in API
Except that .NET Core 3.0 doesn't understand PEM encoding, so you have to do PEM->binary yourself:
private const string RsaPrivateKey = ""RSA PRIVATE KEY"";
private const string SubjectPublicKeyInfo = ""PUBLIC KEY"";

private static byte[] PemToBer(string pem, string header)
{
    // Technically these should include a newline at the end,
    // and either newline-or-beginning-of-data at the beginning.
    string begin = $""-----BEGIN {header}-----"";
    string end = $""-----END {header}-----"";

    int beginIdx = pem.IndexOf(begin);
    int base64Start = beginIdx + begin.Length;
    int endIdx = pem.IndexOf(end, base64Start);

    return Convert.FromBase64String(pem.Substring(base64Start, endIdx - base64Start));
}

Once that's done you can now load the keys:
using (RSA rsa = RSA.Create())
{
    rsa.ImportRSAPrivateKey(PemToBer(pemPrivateKey, RsaPrivateKey), out _);

    ...
}

Semi-manually
If you can't use .NET Core 3.0, but you can use pre-release NuGet packages, you can make use of the prototype ASN.1 reader package (which is the same code that's used internally in .NET Core 3.0; it's just that the API surface isn't finalized).
For the public key:
private static RSA FromSubjectPublicKeyInfo(string pem)
{
    AsnReader reader = new AsnReader(PemToBer(pem, SubjectPublicKeyInfo), AsnEncodingRules.DER);
    AsnReader spki = reader.ReadSequence();
    reader.ThrowIfNotEmpty();

    AsnReader algorithmId = spki.ReadSequence();

    if (algorithmId.ReadObjectIdentifierAsString() != ""1.2.840.113549.1.1.1"")
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException();
    }

    algorithmId.ReadNull();
    algorithmId.ThrowIfNotEmpty();

    AsnReader rsaPublicKey = spki.ReadSequence();

    RSAParameters rsaParameters = new RSAParameters
    {
        Modulus = ReadNormalizedInteger(rsaPublicKey),
        Exponent = ReadNormalizedInteger(rsaPublicKey),
    };

    rsaPublicKey.ThrowIfNotEmpty();

    RSA rsa = RSA.Create();
    rsa.ImportParameters(rsaParameters);
    return rsa;
}

private static byte[] ReadNormalizedInteger(AsnReader reader)
{
    ReadOnlyMemory<byte> memory = reader.ReadIntegerBytes();
    ReadOnlySpan<byte> span = memory.Span;

    if (span[0] == 0)
    {
        span = span.Slice(1);
    }

    return span.ToArray();
}

And because the private key values have to have the correct size arrays, the private key one is just a little trickier:
private static RSA FromRSAPrivateKey(string pem)
{
    AsnReader reader = new AsnReader(PemToBer(pem, RsaPrivateKey), AsnEncodingRules.DER);
    AsnReader rsaPrivateKey = reader.ReadSequence();
    reader.ThrowIfNotEmpty();

    if (!rsaPrivateKey.TryReadInt32(out int version) || version != 0)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException();
    }

    byte[] modulus = ReadNormalizedInteger(rsaPrivateKey);
    int halfModulusLen = (modulus.Length + 1) / 2;

    RSAParameters rsaParameters = new RSAParameters
    {
        Modulus = modulus,
        Exponent = ReadNormalizedInteger(rsaPrivateKey),
        D = ReadNormalizedInteger(rsaPrivateKey, modulus.Length),
        P = ReadNormalizedInteger(rsaPrivateKey, halfModulusLen),
        Q = ReadNormalizedInteger(rsaPrivateKey, halfModulusLen),
        DP = ReadNormalizedInteger(rsaPrivateKey, halfModulusLen),
        DQ = ReadNormalizedInteger(rsaPrivateKey, halfModulusLen),
        InverseQ = ReadNormalizedInteger(rsaPrivateKey, halfModulusLen),
    };

    rsaPrivateKey.ThrowIfNotEmpty();

    RSA rsa = RSA.Create();
    rsa.ImportParameters(rsaParameters);
    return rsa;
}

private static byte[] ReadNormalizedInteger(AsnReader reader, int length)
{
    ReadOnlyMemory<byte> memory = reader.ReadIntegerBytes();
    ReadOnlySpan<byte> span = memory.Span;

    if (span[0] == 0)
    {
        span = span.Slice(1);
    }

    byte[] buf = new byte[length];
    int skipSize = length - span.Length;
    span.CopyTo(buf.AsSpan(skipSize));
    return buf;
}

"14248634","Why would SecKeyEncrypt return paramErr (-50) for input strings longer than 246 bytes?","I am using SecKeyEncrypt with a JSON formatted string as input. If pass SecKeyEncrypt a plainTextLength of less than 246, it works. If I pass it a length of 246 or more, it fails with return value: paramErr (-50).
It could be a matter of the string itself. An example of what I might send SecKeyEncrypt is:

{""handle"":""music-list"",""sym_key"":""MFwwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEBBQADSwAwSAJBALeaEO7ZrjgOFGLBzBHZtQuzH2GNDYMLWP+fIFNu5Y+59C6HECY+jt0yOXXom2mzp/WYYI/9G+Ig8OD6YiKv2nMCAwEAAQ=="",""app_id"":""xgfdt.LibraryTestApp"",""api_key"":""7e080f74de3625b90dd293fc8be560a5cdfafc08""}

The 245th character is '0'.
The ONLY input that is changing between this working and is the plainTextLength. SecKeyGetBlockSize() is returning 256 to me, so any input up to 256 characters long should work.
Here is my encrypt method:

+ (NSData*)encrypt:(NSString*)data usingPublicKeyWithTag:(NSString*)tag
{

    OSStatus status = noErr;

    size_t cipherBufferSize;
    uint8_t *cipherBuffer;

    // [cipherBufferSize]
    size_t dataSize = 246;//[data lengthOfBytesUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
    const uint8_t* textData = [[data dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] bytes];

    SecKeyRef publicKey = [Encryption copyPublicKeyForTag:tag];

    NSAssert(publicKey, @""The public key being referenced by tag must have been stored in the keychain before attempting to encrypt data using it!"");

    //  Allocate a buffer

    cipherBufferSize = SecKeyGetBlockSize(publicKey);
    // this value will not get modified, whereas cipherBufferSize may.
    const size_t fullCipherBufferSize = cipherBufferSize;
    cipherBuffer = malloc(cipherBufferSize);

    NSMutableData* accumulatedEncryptedData = [NSMutableData dataWithCapacity:0];

    //  Error handling

    for (int ii = 0; ii*fullCipherBufferSize < dataSize; ii++) {
        const uint8_t* dataToEncrypt = (textData+(ii*fullCipherBufferSize));
        const size_t subsize = (((ii+1)*fullCipherBufferSize) > dataSize) ? fullCipherBufferSize-(((ii+1)*fullCipherBufferSize) - dataSize) : fullCipherBufferSize;

        // Encrypt using the public key.
        status = SecKeyEncrypt(    publicKey,
                               kSecPaddingPKCS1,
                               dataToEncrypt,
                               subsize,
                               cipherBuffer,
                               &cipherBufferSize
                               );

        [accumulatedEncryptedData appendBytes:cipherBuffer length:cipherBufferSize];
    }

    if (publicKey) CFRelease(publicKey);

    free(cipherBuffer);

    return accumulatedEncryptedData;
}

","From the documentation:

plainTextLen
  Length in bytes of the data in the plainText buffer. This must be less than or equal to the value returned by the SecKeyGetBlockSize function. When PKCS1 padding is performed, the maximum length of data that can be encrypted is 11 bytes less than the value returned by the SecKeyGetBlockSize function (secKeyGetBlockSize() - 11).

(emphasis mine)
You're using PKCS1 padding. So if the block size is 256, you can only encrypt up to 245 bytes at a time.

","publicxml is already a single value comprised of many bits. You can distribute it to those who need it. There are many possible encodings. You should decide for yourself which one you want to use.

","After being confused, I did a lot of research and I could find the solution. First of all, I will describe the situation then I will give the steps to solve the problem. Like I said in my Post, I had the private key (.key-file)  and the certificate (.cer file) and I need to use them in my java-application (server using ssl-protocol). So the first step to do is to create a keystore named.jks-file containing the certificate/key so that I can be able to use them for your java-based-server. To do this step I used the steps described in this link http://blog.jgc.org/2011/06/importing-existing-ssl-keycertificate.html
Now, how can I use my.jks-file in the above posted code?
Well this is a piece of code how to initialize your SSLEngine:
char [] keyphrase=""xxx"".toCharArray();
char [] passphrase= ""yyy"".toCharArray();

// First initialize the key and trust material.
KeyStore ksKeys = KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS"");
InputStream readStream = new FileInputStream(new File(""/.../file.jks""));
ks.load(readStream, passphrase );
// create an factory for key-managers
KeyManagerFactory   =KeyManagerFactory.getInstance(KeyManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
kmf.init(ks, keyphrase);
SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance(""TLS"");
//initialize the ssl-context
sslContext.init(kmf.getKeyManagers(),null,null);

What I've not seen is a good reference implementation, which is surprising given how many companies will need this.
In our particular case, we want to use public key encryption so that the files can not be read on the (weakly protected) system that generates them, and must be sent back to head office where we can look at them.
The best suggestion I've seen so far is ""use log4net but write your own appender using the RFC 3852 streaming implementation from BouncyCastle"". Does anyone have an advance on that?
","Technically, encrypting your log messages should be pretty easy. Using something like Serilog you could simply create a custom sink.
Just blind encrypting the whole log is probably going to limit the usefulness of the logs though. If you're centralizing your logging using something like ELK then you won't be able to search based on any field/part of your logs that you encrypt (for example, if you encrypt the machine name then you don't even know where the logs come from!). 
If the kind of information that you're dealing with genuinely is personally identifiable information covered by GDPR then maybe you just have to suck that up - but I'd make an effort to encrypt only sensitive information from your logs rather than just blanket encrypting everything... that would require a more sophisticated sink but it will make your log data way less crippled.

","I agree with some of the commentators; personal data should not be a part of the log files. GDPR is not about the encryption - if you just encrypt personal data that does not mean that you're GDPR compliant. What will happen with the personal data in your log files when you receive ""forget me"" (Right to erasure) request from the individual? Or ""change my data"" (Right to rectification)?
However, if you need to log personal data, maybe the option can be to hash the information and store hashed version in the logs. In that case, you'll be able to find the specific data in the logs, by calculating the hash from the search string.

*the URL is given to me as a parameter in a JSON request.  Sure, the URL will be HTTPS and I can check the domain name and all that.  But it seems like I should be doing checks on the certificate itself
","Maybe I only partly address your question. It seems that your largest worry is the security of the channel via which you obtain the key. You do not show any code of how you obtain that key, but you said that you retrieve it via HTTPS and now you want to verify the authenticity of this connection by certificate verification.
You can comfortably do so using the well-established third-party web client framework requests.
Quote from the docs:

Requests can verify SSL certificates for HTTPS requests, just like a
  web browser. To check a host’s SSL certificate, you can use the verify
  argument:

requests.get(url, verify=True)

Also:

You can pass verify the path to a CA_BUNDLE file with certificates of
  trusted CAs.

The latter could look like
requests.get(url, verify='/path/to/cert.pem')

In case you really want to take control (and reduce complexity), then load the right file from http://www.symantec.com/page.jsp?id=roots and take the verify='/path/to/cert.pem' approach. I guess you need http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/verisign/roots/Class-3-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G2.pem

*the URL is given to me as a parameter in a JSON request.  Sure, the URL will be HTTPS and I can check the domain name and all that.  But it seems like I should be doing checks on the certificate itself
","You are right that you should check the certificate itself.  And yes, you need the VeriSign root certificate(s) (and any other intermediate certificates to have the complete chain of trust) which signed the certificate to be checked.
Current Symantec (VeriSign) root certificates can be found here in zipfile.
Download and unzip the zip file and find all certificates you wish to trust and put them together (in pem format) into one certificate bundle file.
Now you need to do the actual verification.  Unfortunately, the OpenSSL call you need is X509_verify_certificate.  I looked at the source for both pyopenssl and M2Crypto and neither expose that call, so there's no direct Python code you can call to verify the certificate with either of those packages.
However, since you are using pyopenssl you obviously have the openssl library available.  Thus you probably already have or can easily install the openssl command-line tool set.  If so, you can call the openssl verify command through a pipe by doing something like this:
cert = OpenSSL.crypto.load_certificate(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_ASN1, key)
# the command like likes pem format
cert_pem = OpenSSL.crypto.dump_certificate(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, cert)

# the bundle that you created from the zip extraction
certificate_bundle = 'verisign-root-bundle.pem'

# Pipe the cert to the openssl verify command and check the return code
# a return code of 0 is successful verify
import subprocess
p = subprocess.Popen(['openssl', 'verify', '-CAfile', certificate_bundle],
                     stdin=subprocess.PIPE)
p.communicate(input=cert_pem)
p.wait()
if (p.returncode == 0):
    print('Certificate Verified.')
else:
    print('Problem with certificate')

The above pipe runs the command
openssl verify -CAfile ca.bundle certificate.pem

Finally, if you're not familiar with openssl, the command to show certificates is
openssl x509 -inform PEM -text -in certificate.pem

Hope this helps!

"17931487","Load certificate keys into CngKey class for use with DiffieHellman (ECDiffieHellmanCng class)","This is related to .NET / C#. Lets assume there is a certificate + private key (P521 ECC one) inside a PFX or a PKCS#12 file. We have loaded this certificate and it's private key into the Windows certificate store by installing it (either double clicking the PFX or running certutil -f -p myPfxPassword -importPFX MY SomeEcCert.pfx). I have noted that if the certificate is compatible (eg. p521 curve), it is automatically installed as a CNG certificate/key.
Now, how can I load the private key into a CngKey so I can then use it inside the ECDiffieHellmanCng class? I would also like to load the X509 (CNG) certificate to read it's serial #, issuer, common name etc for some bookkeeping. 
var myCngKey = SomehowLoadTheCngKey(""my ecc certificate""); // <== ??
var myDH = new ECDiffieHellmanCng(myCngKey);

","Well, .NET's doesn't have a good API into CNG. If you even scratch the surface of their API you immediately see it's kinda ridiculous, especially considering both are from Microsoft and CNG is the most serious of all Crypto APIs on the entire windows platform.
So you need to use CLRSecurity which provides C# interfaces (via P/Invoke) into the C++ CNG API. Even with that it's not the nicest of API designs; but it helps.
// Load the cert, many ways, one implementation
var store = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.LocalMachine);
store.Open(OpenFlags.OpenExistingOnly | OpenFlags.ReadOnly);
var certs = store.Certificates.Find(X509FindType.FindBySubjectName, ""My cert subject name"", true);
store.Close();

if (certs.Count > 0)
    cert = certs[0];
else
    return;

// Magic happens here! We load the private CngKey (if it exists)
// You need CLR Security for this, it manages the P/Invoke
// into the C++ api behind the scenes. 
var pvtCngKey = cert.GetCngPrivateKey(); 

// Create the DiffieHellman helper
var ecDh = new ECDiffieHellmanCng(ourPvtEcCngKey)
{
   KeyDerivationFunction = ECDiffieHellmanKeyDerivationFunction.Hash,
   HashAlgorithm = CngAlgorithm.Sha256

","After so many hours researching, testing, giving up, researching again, etc., for a solution on RSA interoperability for .NET and Javascript, I have found this library:
http://www.jocys.com/Common/JsClasses/Documents/
Their classes have the same working code as the RSACryptoServiceProvider on the server.
What you have to do:

Download the source code from their SVN (user guest, empty password):
https://jocys.com:8443/svn/Default/Projects/Jocys.com/WebSites/WebApp/Common/JsClasses/
Rename the files from *.debug.js to *.js. See the list of files below, on (3).
Add the required files to your html page

"32571366","addIdentity in JSch is private key of calling program's Server","""Server 1"" is reading from and writing to ""Server 2"" using SSH.

""Server 1"" is having ""Server 1's"" private key and public key of ""Server 2"".
""Server 2"" is having ""Server 2's"" private key and public key of ""Server 1"".

In JSch, when I use a Java program to communicate from ""Server 1"" to ""Server 2"", the program is using addIdentity method. This method is using ""Server 1's"" private key and JSch will not send this to anybody (""Server 2""), am I right?
Am confused with mentioning private key in this in addIdentity method. If possible please give me some JSch related doc which enlighten me more.
","Your understanding is correct.
The .addIdentity is used to specify what private key should be used to locally encrypt the data before sending them to the remote server (and to decrypt the incoming data). The private key itself is not sent anywhere. Only a public key is.
Note that the .addIdentity loads a key pair (both the public and the private key). Even if you use an overload that takes prvkey path only, the JSch assumes that the public key file has the same name, just .pub extension; or that the ""private key"" file actually contains both public and private key.

For details, read about Public-key/asymmetric cryptography.

Though note that the key is a private key of the account you are connecting with to the remote server. It's not (should not be) a private key of the local machine (even if the machine happens to be a [SSH] server).

"9007912","How does SSL support in PHP PDO (MySQL) work?","I'm familiar with the public/private key negotiation implemented in HTTPS, which is why I am confused by the following driver options that are apparently available (though not officially documented) for PDO's MySQL driver:
PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_KEY
PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CERT
PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA

The link suggests they point to files stored locally - yet why would a copy of anything besides the CA certificate be stored on the client? Has anyone successfully made an encrypted connection using this method?
","This pertains to client certificates that the client must have in order to be able to connect to the server, i.e. that the client must verify its identity (yes, SSL can work the other way around as well). Start by reading the general section Using SSL for Secure Connections, then see the REQUIRE clauses in the GRANT syntax:


REQUIRE X509 means that the client must have a valid certificate but that the exact certificate, issuer, and subject do not matter. The only requirement is that it should be possible to verify its signature with one of the CA certificates.
REQUIRE ISSUER 'issuer' places the restriction on connection attempts that the client must present a valid X509 certificate issued by CA 'issuer'. If the client presents a certificate that is valid but has a different issuer, the server rejects the connection. Use of X509 certificates always implies encryption, so the SSL option is unnecessary in this case.

"42266533","Decrypt Non-Armored PGP Files With OpenPGP.js","I am working on a Node application into which I have built a decrypter function, and have used the Openpgp.js npm module to make this work. I take in various submitted PGP client files made with our public key, decrypt them using our private key as they come in, and place the decrypted versions in a folder for me to access, and all seems to be well....as long as the files are armored. Here are some sample lines of the code showing the order of events:
const encryptedData = fs.readFileSync(encryptedFilePath, 'utf8')
openpgp.decrypt({
        message: openpgp.message.readArmored(encryptedData),
        publicKeys,
        privateKey
}).then( (decrypted) => { fs.writeFile(decryptedFilePath, decrypted.data } )

When an armored file comes through, all is well and I get the decrypted file in the specified folder. These files when opened in a text editor are formatted like this:
-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
WBh2X7KwfEBDx0LEE1FzlnvxZs44o62FclpTazJpcl9J7DjwVfg9cHCID0TAN6Y6
B3b5bCQQFe1wTgpIkVtd0mFGQx7KGHj4FGte53qseVxC2bfq9PGKRIAUg6olr+82

However, we have clients that encrypt files with the armored option off, so they come in a hexidecimal-type format when opened in a text editor....
7403 436d e6c0 f941 daac 945b 9a81 f066
6cd2 0032 5df0 9ca2 23a0 6eec a7bb f24c
a941 99a8 1053 ae23 f88b 245c f709 c2b2

.....or as encoded text files, which look like this:
DµÉ‰í+�3K€Ð�˜PªeZ_|Ò®ó0��ãZqRµ3!ŒpuÉW�NZrìÚk´
Aˆ›œiêø8�Ú�ól:äÎŸ”�6‡)
w�¬ÌŒWÝÚ¢�Q��œ�œ?�H¨¿�œ//�ÃBA�´>(%°�e�

(These last two resemble what I see when I console log ""encryptedData"" above in my code example.)
Whenever any non-armored files come in, the process fails and I initially got a couple different errors depending on the type shown above. I took away the 'utf8' encoding on the fs.readFileSync and put ""fromBinary"" in place of ""readArmored"" to work with the data as binary thinking that might work, but then I get errors about ""Invalid session key for decryption"". So then I tried using the ""decryptSessionKey"" function before the main decrypt as it shows in the docs, and this gets me an undefined key and an error about ""No symmetrically encrypted session key packet found"". Besides, I'm probably barking up the wrong tree, as using binary with Openpgp.js seems to require a password, which I'm thinking is different than the passphrase that unlocks my private key, which is the only password I have. 
I have searched all through the Openpgp.js documentation and Googled like crazy, but can't seem to find a solid procedure on how to amend my code which works for ASCII armored files to decrypt files that are not armored. (Every single file that comes in, however, decrypts quickly and without error when using a desktop decrypting program like PGP Desktop, so I can't figure out where my discrepancy is and why the solution isn't obvious.)  Anyone have any experience with this or a possible solution? 
","The non-armored version of openpgp.message.readArmored() is openpgp.message.read()
So something like this should work:
const encryptedData = fs.readFileSync(encryptedFilePath, 'utf8')

if encryptedData.startsWith('-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----')
    encryptedMessage = openpgp.message.readArmored(encryptedData)
else
    var TextEncoder = require('text-encoding').TextEncoder;
    var encryptedUint8 = new TextEncoder().encode(encryptedData);
    encryptedMessage = openpgp.message.read(encryptedUint8)

openpgp.decrypt({
    message: encryptedMessage,
    publicKeys,
    privateKey
}).then( (decrypted) => { fs.writeFile(decryptedFilePath, decrypted.data } )

(The var TextEncoder line is not required here if you load TextEncoder earlier in your code)

","It's probably not a ""hash"" of the private key. It's most likely the private key in PKCS#8 format.
You can use the openssl command line tool to create a PKCS#12 keystore that should then be able to be used to construct an X509Certificate2 object.
First you will likely have to convert your private key from DER to PEM format, which can also be done in openssl:
openssl rsa -in pkcs8privatekey.der -inform der -out privatekey.pem

Then create the PKCS#12 keystore with:
openssl pkcs12 -export -name myalias -in mycert.crt -inkey privatekey.pem -out keystore.p12

Finally, you should be able to import this into X509Certificate2 object:

I completely dismiss the criticisms of JS-based encryption as being inherently weaker than other client-based tool, though. Just because you can debug a JS script in the browser and is the code exists in plaintext doesn't mean it's any different inherently than any other client-based encryption system. ""Easier"" does not mean ""less secure"". Any encryption software that runs outside of a secure system is equally at risk of tampering and manipulation no matter what.

","At some point the cryptographic primitives in your code will need to access and use the actual value of the key. There's simply no way around that. In a simple analogy, you cannot compute a + b if you don't know a.
The big question concerning secure software design thus boils down to how long sensitive information will persist in an unprotected state. Any sort of password caching is your enemy here, but even if neither the password nor the decrypted key are explicitly cached, they're still in memory at some point. Freezing a computer with liquid nitrogen can keep the memory content intact for a considerable amount of time, and forcing a swap-to-disk is another problem.
Good cryptographic programs should take care to overwrite the memory content as promptly as feasible and minimize the amount of time that sensitive information is retained in readable form. This requires careful analysis of which information is critical (e.g. the user's password input), and platform-specific knowledge of memory management (e.g. can you request non-pageable memory?).
It all depends on your threat model - which sort of attack do you need to protect against? If a rootkit monitors all your memory, you might be in trouble, though that rootkit would probably just read the user's password entry from the keyboard anyway.
This is a complicated issue, and there's extensive research into secure hardware design. In general, the more access an attacker has to your machine, the more likely it is that she'll be able to read sensitive data. Good design can only strive to minimize the surface of attack.

Exception in thread ""main"" javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Data must start with zero

I also tried to explicitly use ""RSA/ECB/NoPadding"", and this fails on decoding period. (Eg the decoded ciphertext doesn't match the original plaintext).
Last but not least, I have tried to perform this when using my own PKCS1.5 padding function ala the PKCS1.5 specs:
EMB = 00 || 02 || RD || 00 || MD
EMB is encoded messageblock of length k
Where RD are 8 random nonzero bytes
MD is max length k = 11, and optionally padded with zero bytes to make EMB length k.
After two days of testing I can only conclude that the RSA algo in Java is flawed or simply not performing what I expect it to perform.
Any suggestions or fixes to the above code are very welcome, as I am completely stumped on why the above code will not simply work as expected.
","Don't do this:
String CipherText = new String(enc.doFinal(PlainText.getBytes()));

Two reasons:

It's almost never a good idea to call String.getBytes() without specifying an encoding. Do you really want the result to depend on the system default encoding?
It's definitely never a good idea to treat the result of a binary encryption operation (i.e. opaque binary data) as an encoded string. Encode it in Base64 or hex instead.

You can use Apache Commons Codec to perform the base64 encode/decode operations, or this standalone public domain encoder/decoder.

","In Python 3 there is a difference between strings and bytes. PyCrypto works on bytes, so you need to give it bytes, but ""Bob"" is a string. You can convert a string a to bytes with a.encode(), which uses a default encoding. If you have another encoding in mind, then you need to specify it. 
You can also mark a literal string as bytes by prefixing it with a b. Example: b""Bob"".

Further Inspection:
In Logcat, upon printing the decoded bytes, they actually differ from the one on the server:
    Log.d(TAG, Arrays.toString(data));
    [2, -62, 0, 16, 88, -13, 33, -59, -2, 42, -8, 94, -16, 9, -117, -96, 101, 28, -15, -90, 0, 16, 12, 31, -27, -25, 17, 16, 102, 118, -69, -124, 75, -59, 11, -102, -65, -16]

In python console:
In [131]: [_ for _ in ap.public_key.tobytes()]
Out[131]: [2, 194, 0, 16, 88, 243, 33, 197, 254, 42, 248, 94, 240, 9, 139, 160, 101, 28, 241, 166, 0, 16, 12, 31, 229, 231, 17, 16, 102, 118, 187, 132, 75, 197, 11, 154, 191, 240]

It would be great if someone can explain the reason to this anomaly, and also help me out on the small snippet to get PublicKey instance from the String.

I know SSL is an option, but my application is a small plugin which can be installed on any website that allows a user to purchase products on that website. Is there a way i can encrypt all the data at front end and decrypt at back end.
Thanks in advance! 
","Generally speaking, in browser cryptography can be considered a bad idea. Sending the data over ssl-tls would likely be much more secure than a home-brewed crypto solution, like you seem to be suggesting. This can be considered especially bad when transmitting data like credit card info, as it appears you will be.
http allows for extremely easy man in the middle attacks to eavesdrop on any data being sent either way, so there would almost certainly be no secure way to transmit the keys in the first place, let alone the secure information. 
If you really really want to go this route, then have a look at crypto-js.
This is not a good idea, and you should use SSL. Probably hence the downvotes.
Considering your use case, the best way to do this would probably be to host your own central service with SSL enabled, and route all ajax requests to your service, not theirs. Their servers could then poll your server using your SSL certificate, to view any relevant information. So you would be acting as some sort of centralised API, with both the clients and businesses connecting. You still need to consider however, that any information sent in the clear, ie over http, not https, can be tampered with before it reaches the user.
As far as I am aware, no, you cannot generate SSL certificates on the fly.

"17496619","Crypto RSA in Python","I am checking a code written in Python which is used to generate an RSA public private key pair.
It generates the keypair however, at the end of the code it runs ssh-keygen again. I am not sure why that is done. Since, RSA.generate() will itself generate the keypair that we export into two separate files. Why is there a need to run ssh-keygen again?
Here are few lines from the code:
keypair = RSA.generate(1024, randfunc)

with open(""pub"", ""w"") as pubfile, open(""id_rsa"", ""w"") as privfile:
    privfile.write(keypair.exportKey())
    pubfile.write(keypair.publickey().exportKey())

system(""ssh-keygen -m PKCS8 -i -f pub > id_rsa.pub && rm pub"")

the file pub will store the public key and id_rsa will store the private key from the keypair generated by RSA.generate() function.
Now, why is it running the ssh-keygen command at the end?
Also, it does not take any input file for the -i parameter and -f parameter takes the name pub which was the public key already generated.
After executing the code I get two files, id_rsa and id_rsa.pub
id_rsa is the private key generated using RSA.generate() but id_rsa.pub stores the result of ssh-keygen command.
I need some help to understand the reason for invoking ssh-keygen at the end of the script and also the parameters passed to ssh-keygen. -i should be passed some value and also -f should have output filename and not input.
Note: I read that this is done to convert the public key from OpenSSL format to OpenSSH format using ssh-keygen so that it starts with ssh-rsa instead of BEGIN PUBLIC KEY.
Does that mean the format of corresponding private key should also be changed?
Since it starts with,
BEGIN PRIVATE KEY
","You are correct in the fact that ssh-keygen is run to convert the generated PEM Format Public Key into a OpenSSH Format Public Key.
There's no really good way to do this in Python as far as I know. 
The OpenSSH format only exists for a Public Key.
So, no, you do not need to convert the Private Key if it begins with
-------- BEGIN PRIVATE KEY --------- or -------- BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY ---------

","This is possible, and you don't need to use an applet.  You can set your web service container (IIS, Tomcat, etc.) to enforce 2-way (mutual) SSL.

After the client cert's CA is found in the trust list, the cert will be forwarded to the web app, where further authorization can take place.
You shouldn't need ""cryto usb hardware specific SDK"" on the server side.  The server just receives it as a certificate.  The server doesn't know if it came from a file or a usb  token on the client side.  So the server just needs to know how to process X509 certificates.  The browser and/or the software drivers on the client side actually do all the interaction with the USB token, so that when the browser talks to the server, it is only sending a certificate.

Create a license file (plaintext).
Create an RSA-keypair.
Use the public key to encrypt the license file.
Put the private key in the binary of the application.
The application can then decode the license file and start running.

The thing is that I have to ship the private key with my application. Is that a problem if I keep the public key secret?
If not, what other good (enough) schemes exist to create a license-file system?
","It is possible to recover a public key from a private key, so having the private key embedded in the application would be as good as publishing both the private and public keys in cleartext (modulo the effort of hacking the private key out of the binary).
Many people resort to obfuscation in these situations.  Other solutions would be a hardware token, network authentication, or an off-the-shelf license management system.

totient = 3120. // (p - 1) * (q - 1)

d = 1231. // d * e = 1219921, which is equal to the relation where 1 + k * totient = 1219921 when k = 391.

I am trying to write a method to encrypt each byte in a string and return back an encrypted string:
public string Encrypt(string m, Encoding encoding)
{
    byte[] bytes = encoding.GetBytes(m);
    for (int i = 0; i < bytes.Length; i++)
    {
        bytes[i] = (byte)BigInteger.ModPow(bytes[i], e, n);
    }
    string encryptedString = encoding.GetString(bytes);
    Console.WriteLine(""Encrypted {0} as {1}."", m, encryptedString);
    return encryptedString;
}

The obvious issue here is that BigInteger.ModPow(bytes[i], e, n) may be too large to fit into a byte-space; it could result in values over 8 bits in size. How do you get around this issue while still being able to decrypt an encrypted string of bytes back into a regular string?
Update: Even encrypting from byte[] to byte[], you reach a case where encrypting that byte using the RSA algorithm goes beyond the size limit of a byte:
public byte[] Encrypt(string m, Encoding encoding)
{
    byte[] bytes = encoding.GetBytes(m);
    for (int i = 0; i < bytes.Length; i++)
    {
        bytes[i] = (byte)BigInteger.ModPow(bytes[i], e, n);
    }
    return bytes;
}

Update: My issue is that encryption would cause a greater number of bytes than the initial input string had:
public byte[] Encrypt(string m, Encoding encoding)
{
    byte[] bytes = encoding.GetBytes(m);
    byte[] returnBytes = new byte[0];
    for (int i = 0; i < bytes.Length; i++)
    {
        byte[] result = BigInteger.ModPow(bytes[i], (BigInteger)e, n).ToByteArray();
        int preSize = returnBytes.Length;
        Array.Resize(ref returnBytes, returnBytes.Length + result.Length);
        result.CopyTo(returnBytes, preSize);
    }
    return returnBytes;
}

public string Decrypt(byte[] c, Encoding encoding)
{
    byte[] returnBytes = new byte[0];
    for (int i = 0; i < c.Length; i++)
    {
        byte[] result = BigInteger.ModPow(c[i], d, n).ToByteArray();
        int preSize = returnBytes.Length;
        Array.Resize(ref returnBytes, returnBytes.Length + result.Length);
        result.CopyTo(returnBytes, preSize);
    }
    string decryptedString = encoding.GetString(returnBytes);
    return decryptedString;
}

If you ran this code like this:
byte[] encryptedBytes = engine.Encrypt(""Hello, world."", Encoding.UTF8);
Console.WriteLine(engine.Decrypt(encryptedBytes, Encoding.UTF8));

The output would be this:
?♥D
?♥→☻►♦→☻►♦oD♦8? ?♠oj?♠→☻►♦;♂?♠♂♠?♠

Obviously, the output is not the original string because I can't just try decrypting each byte at a time, since sometimes two or more bytes of the cypher-text represent the value of one integer that I need to decrypt back to one byte of the original string...so I want to know what the standard mechanism for handling this is.

"24267332","How to encrypt a string using public key cryptography","I am trying to implement my own RSA encryption engine. Given these RSA algorithm values:
p = 61. // A prime number.
q = 53. // Also a prime number.
n = 3233. // p * q.
totient = 3120. // (p - 1) * (q - 1)
e = 991. // Co-prime to the totient (co-prime to 3120).
d = 1231. // d * e = 1219921, which is equal to the relation where 1 + k * totient = 1219921 when k = 391.

I am trying to write a method to encrypt each byte in a string and return back an encrypted string:
public string Encrypt(string m, Encoding encoding)
{
    byte[] bytes = encoding.GetBytes(m);
    for (int i = 0; i < bytes.Length; i++)
    {
        bytes[i] = (byte)BigInteger.ModPow(bytes[i], e, n);
    }
    string encryptedString = encoding.GetString(bytes);
    Console.WriteLine(""Encrypted {0} as {1}."", m, encryptedString);
    return encryptedString;
}

The obvious issue here is that BigInteger.ModPow(bytes[i], e, n) may be too large to fit into a byte-space; it could result in values over 8 bits in size. How do you get around this issue while still being able to decrypt an encrypted string of bytes back into a regular string?
Update: Even encrypting from byte[] to byte[], you reach a case where encrypting that byte using the RSA algorithm goes beyond the size limit of a byte:
public byte[] Encrypt(string m, Encoding encoding)
{
    byte[] bytes = encoding.GetBytes(m);
    for (int i = 0; i < bytes.Length; i++)
    {
        bytes[i] = (byte)BigInteger.ModPow(bytes[i], e, n);
    }
    return bytes;
}

Update: My issue is that encryption would cause a greater number of bytes than the initial input string had:
public byte[] Encrypt(string m, Encoding encoding)
{
    byte[] bytes = encoding.GetBytes(m);
    byte[] returnBytes = new byte[0];
    for (int i = 0; i < bytes.Length; i++)
    {
        byte[] result = BigInteger.ModPow(bytes[i], (BigInteger)e, n).ToByteArray();
        int preSize = returnBytes.Length;
        Array.Resize(ref returnBytes, returnBytes.Length + result.Length);
        result.CopyTo(returnBytes, preSize);
    }
    return returnBytes;
}

public string Decrypt(byte[] c, Encoding encoding)
{
    byte[] returnBytes = new byte[0];
    for (int i = 0; i < c.Length; i++)
    {
        byte[] result = BigInteger.ModPow(c[i], d, n).ToByteArray();
        int preSize = returnBytes.Length;
        Array.Resize(ref returnBytes, returnBytes.Length + result.Length);
        result.CopyTo(returnBytes, preSize);
    }
    string decryptedString = encoding.GetString(returnBytes);
    return decryptedString;
}

If you ran this code like this:
byte[] encryptedBytes = engine.Encrypt(""Hello, world."", Encoding.UTF8);
Console.WriteLine(engine.Decrypt(encryptedBytes, Encoding.UTF8));

The output would be this:
?♥D
?♥→☻►♦→☻►♦oD♦8? ?♠oj?♠→☻►♦;♂?♠♂♠?♠

Obviously, the output is not the original string because I can't just try decrypting each byte at a time, since sometimes two or more bytes of the cypher-text represent the value of one integer that I need to decrypt back to one byte of the original string...so I want to know what the standard mechanism for handling this is.
","Your basic code for encrypting and decrypting each byte - the call to ModPow - is working, but you're going about the ""splitting the message up and encrypting each piece"" inappropriately.
To show that the ModPow part - i.e. the maths - is fine, here's code based on yours, which encrypts a string to a BigInteger[] and back:
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Numerics;
using System.Text;

class Test
{
    const int p = 61;
    const int q = 53;
    const int n = 3233;
    const int totient = 3120;
    const int e = 991;
    const int d = 1231;

    static void Main()
    {
        var encrypted = Encrypt(""Hello, world."", Encoding.UTF8);
        var decrypted = Decrypt(encrypted, Encoding.UTF8);
        Console.WriteLine(decrypted);
    }

    static BigInteger[] Encrypt(string text, Encoding encoding)
    {
        byte[] bytes = encoding.GetBytes(text);
        return bytes.Select(b => BigInteger.ModPow(b, (BigInteger)e, n))
                    .ToArray();
    }

    static string Decrypt(BigInteger[] encrypted, Encoding encoding)
    {
        byte[] bytes = encrypted.Select(bi => (byte) BigInteger.ModPow(bi, d, n))
                                .ToArray();
        return encoding.GetString(bytes);
    }
}

Next you need to read more about how a byte[] is encrypted into another byte[] using RSA, including all the different padding schemes etc. There's a lot more to it than just calling ModPow on each byte.
But to reiterate, you should not be doing this to end up with a production RSA implementation. The chances of you doing that without any security flaws are very slim indeed. It's fine to do this for academic interest, to learn more about the principles of cryptography, but leave the real implementations to experts. (I'm far from an expert in this field - there's no way I'd start implementing my own encryption...)

","Note: I updated this answer. Please scroll down to the update for how it should actually be implemented because this first way of doing it is not the correct way of doing RSA encryption.
One way I can think to do it is like this (but may not be compliant to standards), and also, note this does not pad:
public byte[] Encrypt(string m, Encoding encoding)
{
    byte[] bytes = encoding.GetBytes(m);
    byte[] returnBytes = new byte[0];
    for (int i = 0; i < bytes.Length; i++)
    {
        byte[] result = BigInteger.ModPow(bytes[i], (BigInteger)e, n).ToByteArray();
        int preSize = returnBytes.Length;
        Array.Resize(ref returnBytes, returnBytes.Length + result.Length + 1);
        (new byte[] { (byte)(result.Length) }).CopyTo(returnBytes, preSize);
        result.CopyTo(returnBytes, preSize + 1);
    }
    return returnBytes;
}

public string Decrypt(byte[] c, Encoding encoding)
{
    byte[] returnBytes = new byte[0];
    for (int i = 0; i < c.Length; i++)
    {
        int dataLength = (int)c[i];
        byte[] result = new byte[dataLength];
        for (int j = 0; j < dataLength; j++)
        {
            i++;
            result[j] = c[i];
        }
        BigInteger integer = new BigInteger(result);
        byte[] integerResult = BigInteger.ModPow(integer, d, n).ToByteArray();
        int preSize = returnBytes.Length;
        Array.Resize(ref returnBytes, returnBytes.Length + integerResult.Length);
        integerResult.CopyTo(returnBytes, preSize);
    }
    string decryptedString = encoding.GetString(returnBytes);
    return decryptedString;
}

This has the potential of being cross-platform because you have the option of using a different datatype to represent e or n and pass it to a C# back-end service like that. Here is a test:
string stringToEncrypt = ""Mary had a little lamb."";
Console.WriteLine(""Encrypting the string: {0}"", stringToEncrypt);
byte[] encryptedBytes = engine.Encrypt(stringToEncrypt, Encoding.UTF8);
Console.WriteLine(""Encrypted text: {0}"", Encoding.UTF8.GetString(encryptedBytes));
Console.WriteLine(""Decrypted text: {0}"", engine.Decrypt(encryptedBytes, Encoding.UTF8));

Output:
Encrypting the string: Mary had a little lamb.
Encrypted text: ☻6☻1♦☻j☻☻&♀☻g♦☻t☻☻1♦☻?  ☻g♦☻1♦☻g♦☻?♥☻?☻☻7☺☻7☺☻?♥☻?♂☻g♦☻?♥☻1♦☻$☺☻
c       ☻?☻
Decrypted text: Mary had a little lamb.

Update: Everything I said earlier is completely wrong in the implementation of RSA. Wrong, wrong, wrong! This is the correct way to do RSA encryption:

Convert your string to a BigInteger datatype.
Make sure your integer is smaller than the value of n that you've calculated for your algorithm, otherwise you won't be able to decypher it.
Encrypt the integer. RSA works on integer encryption only. This is clear.
Decrypt it from the encrypted integer.
I can't help but wonder that the BigInteger class was mostly created for cryptography.

As an example:
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Numerics;

            throw new Exception(""The integer must be less than the value of n in order to be decypherable!"");

        {
            return BigInteger.ModPow(integer, d, n);

"13743438","How to implement private/public apikey with werkzeug/bottle?","I am developing a RESTful web service with Bottle, probably soon to migrate to Werkzeug. I'd like to implement an auth scheme that works based on a private/public key pair where the server only has to store the public part while the user keeps the private one.  Upon access, the server would require the accessor to perform an action using the private key that the server can verify and relate to the public key part.  Upon success, for example a token is generated which can be used for some time.  What is the path to implement something like this for Werkzeug or Bottle?  Any projects/examples i could work from?  
","I believe, the best option here is to shift the responsibility to work with cryptography onto something else. Web servers and CA (certification authorities) are good with it. 
Basically, altogether they can 

ensure the connection is secure
ensure the client uses certificate, signed by valid (say, yours) CA
ensure the the certificate hasn't been revoked
provide to your application the only information you need: the identifier of the remote party

We use such mechanism to authenticate a third-party payment service (sorry, private code), and there is also a plugin to Redmine providing the same mechanism of client authorization, and we use it too (certainly, it's Ruby, but it's also a valid proof that such services can be found in wild.)
To make things work, all you need is to

configure your CA.
configure your web-server to ensure it accepts certificates by your authority, and only these certificates, and passes the client id further to your app.
ensure your application can extract client identifier from request.

Below is an tiny example with easyrsa, nginx, uWsgi and werkzeug
Configure CA
The easyrsa toolkit is a part of OpenVPN installation. It's possible to use OpenSSL ""raw"" command or PyOpenSSL, but easyrsa is convenient and suitable at least at the concept stage.
cp -a /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa/2.0 /etc/nginx/easyrsa
cd /etc/nginx/easyrsa && source vars && ./clean-all

Create CA
./build-ca

Create server certificate
./build-key --server server

Create client certificate.
./build-key-pkcs12  client1

In the sample above you create both client secret key and its corresponding public part (certificate), but good practice assumes that you sign client certificate requests instead, and has no access to secret part.
Some services generate a pair of secret key + certificate for you and then write a message on download page like ""this is the only chance for you to download the secret key. We don't store it, so it cannot be download later.""
Additionally, this command creates a PKCS12 file with encrypted key and certificate, which is handy for import to browsers.
Configure nginx
First, we should create a pair ""server certificate + ca certificate"", as our CA self-signed:
cat keys/server.crt keys/ca.crt > keys/server_and_ca.crt

Then the following config can be applied:
server {
    listen 443;

    location / {
        # Here we define the name and the contents of the WSGI variable to pass to service
        uwsgi_param SSL_CLIENT_ID $ssl_client_s_dn;
        include uwsgi_params;
        uwsgi_pass 127.0.0.1:5000;
    }


    # SSL support
    ssl                 on;
    ssl_protocols       SSLv3 TLSv1;
    ssl_certificate     easyrsa/keys/ca_and_server.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key easyrsa/keys/server.key;

    # We don't accept anyone without correct client certificate
    ssl_verify_client on;
    # The CA we use to verify client certificates
    ssl_client_certificate easyrsa/keys/ca.crt;
}

More information on configuration options is available here and here.
Ensure you have correct privileges to the /etc/nginx/easyrsa directory and only root and nginx can get access to secret keys.
Write a Werkzeug application
The python part is trivial. Just read the variable SSL_CLIENT_ID from WSGI environment.
The contents of the sample application in file sample.py
from werkzeug.wrappers import Response

def application(environ, start_response):
    text = 'Hello, your certificate id is %s\n' % environ.get('SSL_CLIENT_ID', '(unknown)')
    response = Response(text, mimetype='text/plain')
    return response(environ, start_response)

Launch the service with a uwsgi server: uwsgi -w sample:application --socket 127.0.0.1:5000
Test your installation
It's easy to test with curl
$ curl --cert keys/client1.crt --key keys/client1.key --cacert keys/ca.crt https://localhost/

","This doesn't answer your question completely, but I'd like to show you another way to put your SSH keys on your servers, in automation using the Rackspace API. If, for instance, you're using pyrax:
import pyrax
import os

pyrax.set_setting(""identity_type"", ""rackspace"")
pyrax.set_setting(""username"", USER_NAME) # User name
pyrax.set_setting(""api_key"", API_KEY) # Located in the control panel in settings

# Could also use a credential file
# pyrax.set_credential_file(os.path.expanduser(""~/.rackspace_cloud_credentials""))

# Put your SSH key on the Rackspace cloud
pubkey = open(""my_priv_key"").read()
cs.keypairs.create(""testkey"", pubkey)

# For demo purposes, grab a sample image, server type (flavor in OpenStack parlance)
flavor_512 = [flavor for flavor in cs.flavors.list() if flavor.ram == 512][0]
ubu_image = [img for img in cs.images.list() if ""Ubuntu 12.04"" in img.name][0]

# Now we can create the server and assign an ssh key
server = cs.servers.create(""ubbie"", ubu_image.id, flavor_512.id,
        key_name=""testkey"")

Your API Key is located in Settings and Contacts within the Cloud Control panel, underneath the security question:

Once the server is built, you should be able to grab the ip address
server = cs.servers.get(server.id)
ip = server.accessIPv4

Then simply ssh as root using the key you specified.
ssh -i my_priv_key root@<ip>

If Python isn't your preferred language, there are other options. You can also make direct requests/use curl if that's your thing, as this is part of the Rackspace API and OpenStack/nova proper.

How to generate public and private keys usable for both C and Java?

Generating the key pairs and representing them in memory is different than consuming them in Java or another framework/library, like OpenSSL.
Representing keys in memory is framework/library specific.
Encoding the keys so different frameworks/libraries can consume them is the trick.


However when I try to use the keys in Java the program chokes, saying the key format is wrong. 

In Java, its usually enough to call getBytes() on the key. The key will be provided in a natural representation. For example calling it on a RSA public key will result in an ASN.1 encoding from PKCS 1.
Other formats you can consider for interoperability are PKCS8 for private keys and PKCS12.
There's also PEM, but its an older format. PEM is OK for public keys, but you should use PKCS8 or PKCS12 for private keys.

The private you generated with OpenSSL is probably in encrypted PEM format (you should state the encoding you are using for them). See java read pem encoded key and How to read a password encrypted key with java?. If its DER encoded, then see java read der encoded key

The starting point was: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/alejacma/archive/2008/01/28/how-to-generate-key-pairs-encrypt-and-decrypt-data-with-cryptoapi.aspx
Issues encountered
1)  Microsoft public and private keys used by CryptoAPI use a proprietary binary format (generally referred to as PUBLICKEYBLOB and PRIVATEKEYBLOB) that cannot be used by Java. Conversion of keys is required;
2)  The Crypto API encrypts in little-endian binary format while Java reads bytes in big-endian format. Ref: http://www.jensign.com/JavaScience/dotnet/RSAEncrypt/  and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness
Binary conversion is required;
3)  The Microsoft CryptoAPI pads the message when it encrypts it. This means to decrypt in Java, the exact implementation of the RSA algorithm is required which takes into consideration the padding scheme used.
On the Java decrypt side, I used Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/NONE/PKCS1Padding"");
Hope this is helpful to someone.

How to solve this problem without increasing the size of key?
","With asymmetric encryption there is no way to encrypt data longer than key minus padding. Since it's 11 bytes for you I can conclude you use PKCS#1 padding. What you can do is try to compress data, but depending on data length and nature it easily can fail. Another option is to combine symmetric block ciphers (which has no limitation for the size of data) and asymmetric encryption:

Generate random AES key
byte[] keyData = new byte[32];
SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
random.nextBytes(keyData);

Encrypt data with AES.
// zero filled input vector
byte[] ivData = new byte[32];
IvParameterSpec iv = new IvParameterSpec(ivData);
SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyData, ""AES"");
Cipher aes = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");
aes.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, keySpec, iv);
byte[] cipherText = aes.doFinal(data);

Encrypt AES key (for AES-256 it's 32 bytes) with RSA private key.
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");
cipher.init(Cipher.WRAP_MODE, rsaKeyPair.getPublic());
byte[] wrappedKey = cipher.doFinal(keyData);

Combine wrappedKey with cipherText. Can be done with just appending one to another, but also some binary format can be used.

If you haven't imported the private key yet, save it to a file (let's say, key.pgp, name and extension don't matter). Now run gpg --import <key.pgp. Your key should be listed using gpg -K now.
For setting trust (the highest trust level in OpenPGP is ""ultimate"", which is usually only applied to your own certificates, as you want to do in this case), run gpg --edit-key [key-id] (printed in gpg -K above).

Should this be self-explanatory? I don't understand what they want me to do.
They say the same thing in the comments of the example, but what the heck p they don't actually demonstrate what they mean by their instructions. Here's what it says:

Instead of just storing the entire literal string here embedded in
  the
           * program,  construct the key at runtime from pieces or
           * use bit manipulation (for example, XOR with some other string) to hide
           * the actual key.  The key itself is not secret information, but we don't
           * want to make it easy for an attacker to replace the public key with one
           * of their own and then fake messages from the server.

So how exactly might a person do this?
","It's a very basic information that they are trying to say. Let's see this example:
Some developer might store there license as a string itself:
private static final String LICENSE_1=""xxx-yyy-zzz""
private static final String LICENSE_2=""xxz-yyz-zzz""
private static final String LICENSE_N=""xxz-yyz-zzz""

private ArrayList<String> licenseList=new ArrayList<String>();

licenseList.add(LICENSE_N);

And they they might want user to enter their license number, so they will do something like this:
if(licenseList.contains(ExitText.getText().toString())
    //allow
else
   //disallow

Now I can decompile this app and get all the license :D
If you hadn't had anything like above in your code, the only way i could bypass your licensing is: if it's done locally could be by hacking into memory like GameCIH does. Memory hacking is only one example, there are various things attackers might do. You cannot stop them but, you can make their life harder.

","With asymmetrical encryption algorithms, the public and private keys are mathematically related to each other. You cannot change one key without changing the other as well.
As long as you take reasonable measures to protect your private key though, you should rarely need to change it.

Use a large enough key to help prevent it being cracked in the foreseeable future. (size depends on the algorithm, 4096-bit RSA for example.)
Don't store your private key anywhere online.
Store your private key in an encrypted container that is password protected. Make the password long, complex, and memorize it.
Never use your private key on a system you suspect could be compromised.
Consider storing the key completely offline, like on a memory stick or CD (in the encrypted container of course).

These are the minimum that I would personally do.
And if you just happen to be concerned about people having an authentic copy of your public key, generate it's hash and provide a way for people to confirm the hash with you.
When it comes down to it though, the question of whether your keys and communication are secure enough is based on what you're defending against. If you think your system is compromised and the private key is being stolen off your system, then changing your keys frequently is pointless because the new keys will be stolen as well. If you believe your public key has been used to crack your private key, larger keys and better entropy will result in them taking longer to crack.
The current (2012) NIST recommendations for asymmetric keys is to change them every 1-2 years, and to use a minimum key size of 2048 bits.

","Syon made some excellent points.  Another thing to consider is having multiple keys.  It is strongly recommended to have a separate key for signing and a separate key for encrypting.
If you private encrypting key is ever compromised, your signatures are still valid.
And to elaborate on one of Syon's points, you can create and store a private key on a hardware device such as a SafeNet eToken.  The private key cannot be extracted, so as long as you have physical possession of the token, you can be very confident that your private key is safe.

","As far as I been taught, Yes, it is possible to change the private key without changing the public key. 
If {e, n} is the public key (n is the product of two large prime number) and {d,n} is the private key. Then we need to find a new value of e such that m=c^(ed) mod n. This is achieved by solving ed=kx phi(n) +1, where phi(n) is the Eulers Totient function. 
The reason to change the private key is if we believe that the keys have been compromised so we need a new key, but we need to keep the old public key for legacy reasons.

","When an encryption mode isn't explicitely defined it defaults to OAEP. OAEP requires the key be at least 2 * the hash size + 2. The default hash phpseclib uses is sha1, which has a length of 20 bytes. So the key needs to be at least 22 bytes long or 176 bits.
Yours is 16 bytes long or 128 bits.
So you either need to use a larger key or change the encryption mode to use PKCS1 padding. PKCS1 padding requires the modulo be at least 11 bytes.
It'd probably be useful if phpseclib displayed an error when the length of the chosen modulo was insufficient. I'll try to suggeste that to him.
Also, FWIW, textbook RSA doesn't impose any minimum length requirements, but phpseclib doesn't currently implement textbook RSA. I guess you can kinda get it by calling _exponentiate directly but that's the only way.
Textbook RSA is bad because it's vulnerable to certain types of attacks that randomized padding like PKCS1 / OAEP protect against.

Net::SSH::Any does support public key authentication but there are a couple of hidden requirements:

The key must be in OpenSSH format (you can use PuTTY companion utilities to convert keys between formats, google for it)
A file with the public key is also required and it must be placed at ""${path_to_private_key}.pub"".

Besides that, over the last couple of months I have been working on improving Net::SSH::Any and on the way fixing lots of important bugs on the underlying Net::SSH2 module and the libssh2 library. If you feel courageous, you may like to try the development version (you will need the git versions of the three packages, Net::SSH::Any, Net::SSH2 and libssh2).
I would really appreciate getting any feedback about it, specially when running under Windows.

var encryptor = new AsymEncript();

var decrypted = encryptor.decrypt(encrypted, ""private secret key"");

I don't want to deal with complicated libraries such as pidCrypt, jsencrypt. I need a really simple algorithm, which allow me to create public\private key pair. Then I can use this pair for encryption.
Can you point me out to some articles or some ideas how this can be implemented?
","From your equations:
f(x)=x*pubKey
g(m)=m*pKey
g(f(x))=x
You arrive at this:
x=f(x)*pKey => x=x*pubKey*pKey => pubKey = 1/pKey 
This seems like a very weak algorithm (unless I misunderstood you somehow).
If you really care about your security, you should go with some wrapper library that does RSA (or some other algorithm) for you in a simple manner.

","PEM_write_RSAPublicKey() will append to the file if opened with ""a+"" but there is no indication of which keys are for which client. I don't want PEM formatting, only to write each public key to a single line in the file.
I found that the public key is in DER format, which I can get from the RSA struct using:
len = i2d_RSAPublicKey(rsap, 0);
buf1 = buf2 = (unsigned char *)malloc(len + 1);
rc = i2d_RSAPublicKey(rsap, (unsigned char **)&buf2);

Then I base64-encode buf1 and write it to my file. 
After reading it from file, putting it back into the RSA struct is just the reverse:
rsap = d2i_RSAPublicKey(NULL, (const unsigned char **)&buf1, (long)len);

add following code:

[path appendString@""/public.key""]

ok.

So I am sure the path is correct.

Is it because maybe the .key file is like a binary file ?

Unfortunately, value of isValidCoding is false. I think I am misunderstanding something about RSA encryption/decryption!!

Note that, privKey and pubKey have been validated using KEY.Validate(prng, 3).
I have also tried to use RAW RSA instead of OAEP and SHA with no luck. I have tried to debug through crypto++ code, what I am suspicious about is prng variable. I think there is something wrong with it. I have also used AutoSeededRandomPool instead of FixedRNG but it didn't help. Worth to know that, if I copy the decryption code right after encryption code and execute it in Encrypt() method, everything is fine and isValidCoding is true!!
","This is probably not be correct:
byte blockSize = encryptor.FixedMaxPlaintextLength();
...

encryptor.Encrypt(prng, (byte*)plaintext, blockSize, (byte*)output);
return cipherSize;

Try:
size_t maxLength = encryptor.FixedMaxPlaintextLength();
size_t cipherLength = encryptor.CiphertextLength( blockSize );
...

SecureByteBlock secBlock(cipherLength);

cipherLength = encryptor.Encrypt(prng, (byte*)plaintext, blockSize, secBlock);
secBlock.resize(cipherLength);

FixedMaxPlaintextLength returns a size_t, not a byte.
You should probably be calling CiphertextLength on plaintext.
I'm not really sure how you are just returning an uint_t from encrypt().
You might do better by starting fresh, and using an example from the Crypto++ as a starting point. I'm not sure this design is worth pursuing.
If you start over, then Shoup's Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) would be a good choice since it combines public key with symmetric ciphers and authentication tags.

Now i need to do the same thing, except rather than symmetric encryption i need to use a public-key to encrypt, and a private key to decrypt.

Note: It took 3 days to come up with those 15 lines of code for symmetric encryption. i'm hoping someone can same me from a week of banging my head against a wall, and i end up going down the wrong path thinking that i have to install OpenSSL. Even worse, if i try to call COM Objects from native code

","First of all, I see the MCrypt class your using provides source code. Download the source code and add it to your project and modify the padString(string) method to this:
private static String padString(String source){
  char paddingChar = ' ';
  int size = 16;
  int x = source.getBytes(Charset.forName(""UTF-8"")).length % size;
  int padLength = size - x;

  for (int i = 0; i < padLength; i++)
  {
          source += paddingChar;
  }

  return source;
}

This will allow the code to execute while using UTF-8 as a charset. If you want to ""improve"" the library to support mutliple charsets, consider adding a charset parameter into the encrypt/decrypt methods of the class.

","As outlined in this white paper on secure data encryption and its supporting material:

Use HTTPS.
For a second layer of authenticated encryption, use libsodium (a modern, cross-platfrom cryptography library) with pinned public keys.

PHP Example
Key Generation
$bob_box_kp = \Sodium\crypto_box_keypair();
$bob_box_secretkey = \Sodium\crypto_box_secretkey($bob_box_kp);
$bob_box_publickey = \Sodium\crypto_box_publickey($bob_box_kp);

Encryption
$anonymous_message_to_bob = \Sodium\crypto_box_seal(
    $message,
    $bob_box_publickey
);

Decryption
$decrypted_message = \Sodium\crypto_box_seal_open(
    $anonymous_message_to_bob,
    $bob_box_kp
);
if ($decrypted_message === false) {
    // You have the wrong keypair or the message was tampered with.
}

Android Example (using Libstodium)
Key Generation
byte[] secret_key = new byte[Box.SECRETKEYBYTES];
byte[] public_key = new byte[Box.PUBLICKEYBYTES];
Box.keypair(public_key, secret_key);

Encryption
Box.seal(
    ciphertextByteArray, // Output goes here
    plaintextByteArray,  // Your message
    public_key
);

Decryption
Box.sealOpen(

I imagine there is some standard for this whereby I send a public key over an insecure channel and the remote end uses this to encrypt a key to send back to me over the insecure channel, which I can then decrypt to get the key.
What would be an example of this kind of protocol that Botan supports?
","Without previous trust, or communication through a side channel, there's no way to do that. Diffie-Hellman kex allows you to establish a channel secure against others who don't participate in the connection, but you cannot verify that you're communicating with the intended recipient.
Classic MITM example: you connect to some remote endpoint, it receives your public key and sends you something signed with that key. However, you have no way to verify whether you've sent your key to the real destination, or whether the response comes from an attacker - therefore, you have a secure tunnel, but you have no information with whom you're securely communicating (the attacker may even connect to your intended destination and proxy the traffic, which passes over him unencrypted).
To be sure that you are indeed communicating with the intended endpoint, you need to exchange some sort of identification of the host beforehand or through a secure channel. SSH does this using the ""fingerprints"" - it asks you on first connection if you trust that host, and you're supposed to verify the fingerprint through an independent channel.

","What I did in a similar situation was to first arrange to get a private/public key pair exchanged, so, I had the public key of each client, so when they connected to me, a message was passed, that had a timestamp on it, that I could then decrypt.
If that passed, and the timestamp was valid (I used 5 seconds as the life of the timestamp) then I would exchange the key, since we had a way to securely communicate.
But, this required doing something upfront.
If you expect an anonymous user to connect and have some security that is impossible.
One article I found very helpful on issues like this was *Programming Satan's Computer"", http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/satan.pdf, where you are trying to have a secure communication with an untrustworthy sysadmin.

"36204141","Verify Signature of SAML Response","I'm trying to follow the following spec to verify the signature of the SAML response: https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/#sec-PKCS1
Here is my workflow: I get the SAML Response. I get rid of the signature envelope, I canonicalize it, I check the digest and then I check the signature. I was able to successfully calculate SHA1 digest of the transformed SAML response and verify it. However, RSA-SHA1 signature checking still eludes me.
SAML Response included signature method algorithm: http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1
I have this method to check the signature:
public static boolean verifySignature(String signatureType, PublicKey publicKey, byte[] contentBytes, byte[] sigBytes) {
    try {
        Signature sig = Signature.getInstance(signatureType);
        sig.initVerify(publicKey);

newXMLToOperateOn is the correct canonicalized string XML of the SAMLResponse. This is what I use to generate the correct SHA1 digest. Security.verify() works correctly since I use to for OpenID SSO checking and that works.
I also tried to substitute the data to check instead of the entire XML to the bytes of the SHA1 digest, but didn't work either. E.G. verify(algo, pk, sha1Digest.getBytes(), sig.getBytes().
Can someone tell me if there is something that I'm doing horribly wrong when checking the signature? The spec linked above tells me the signing method does this:
   CRYPT (PAD (ASN.1 (OID, DIGEST (data))))

Which doesn't help me a ton when I'm verifying the signature. I cannot recreate the signature since I can't find what private key they use in their examples.
Thanks for any help.

","The mistake was that the public/private key pair needs to be created from the same wrapper.  What I mean by this is that not all key pairs are the same.  My specific problem was that Openssl and the M2Crypto instances of key pairs were not in the same underlying format.  Thus creating keys with Openssl and then trying to use M2Crypto to use the keys was wrong.  The lesson from all of this is to not import keys from other wrappers.  If you do, make sure that they are in the same underlying format like ASCII or Unicode before trying to use them.

It is surprisingly difficult to do that but it is possible; I have done so.  
What you need to do is p/invoke to StrongNameGetPublicKey in mscorwks.dll. 

I read it by using C# and store it in database as binary to use for encrypting my data

This is an extremely bad idea. The purpose of a strong name public key is not to encrypt your data!  The purpose of a strong name public key is for your customers to verify that the assembly you gave them was written by you. If you are using the public key for anything other than that task you are doing something very, very wrong and you should stop doing so immediately.
Strong names use encryption, but they are not an encryption technology; they are an evidence producing technology for the purpose of code access security policy evaluation.

    Dim response = readStrings(""X-Signature"", ""https://api.hitbtc.com"", ""/api/1/trading/balance?nonce="" + exchanges.getNonce().ToString + ""&apikey="" + _apiKey, """", _secret, New System.Security.Cryptography.HMACSHA512(), {})


End Sub

With yobit things are different. I got to use post instead of get. I got to add more headers. However, I think I have fixed that.
It doesn't work.
The python function for yobit API is this I just need to translate that to vb.net which I think I have done faithfully
API Call Authentication in Python ( Working PHP example )
I think the mistake is around here
request_url = ""https://yobit.net/tapi"";
request_body = ""method=TradeHistory&pair=ltc_btc&nonce=123"";
signature = hmac_sha512(request_body,yobit_secret);
http_headers = {
    ""Content-Type"":""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"",
    ""Key"":yobit_public_key,
    ""Sign"":signature
}

response = http_post_request(request_url,request_body,http_headers);
result = json_decode(response.text);

There the stuff that I copied is method=getInfo&nonce=636431012620 which is what I put in post.
So that seems right.
","Looks like it works.
I just need to change the nonce so that it's between 0 to 2^31
So this is the error
 post = ""method=getInfo&nonce=636431012620

The nonce shouldn't be that big. At most it should be
2147483646
Also though not documented, I must add
content type as one of the header. This is the final solution
   Dim nonce = exchanges.getNonce().ToString
    Dim content = hashObject("""", nonce, ""method=getInfo&nonce="")
    Dim sighash = computeSig(content)
    Dim result = CookieAwareWebClient.downloadString1(""https://yobit.net/tapi/"", content, {New Tuple(Of String, String)(""Key"", _apiKey), New Tuple(Of String, String)(""Sign"", sighash), New Tuple(Of String, String)(""Content-Type"", ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"")})

So I added New Tuple(Of String, String)(""Content-Type"", ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"") as one of the headers
Protected Overridable Function computeSig(content As String) As String
    Dim hasher = New System.Security.Cryptography.HMACSHA512(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(_secret))
    Return CalculateSignature2(content, hasher)
End Function

Public Shared Function CalculateSignature2(content As String, hasher As System.Security.Cryptography.HMAC) As String
    Dim siginhash = hasher.ComputeHash(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(content))
    Dim sighash = exchanges.getString(siginhash) 'convert bytes to string
    Return sighash
End Function

Public Shared Function downloadString1(url As String, post As String, otherHeaders As Tuple(Of String, String)()) As String
    Dim wc = New CookieAwareWebClient()
    For Each oh In otherHeaders
        wc.Headers.Add(oh.Item1, oh.Item2)
    Next

    Dim response = String.Empty

        If post = """" Then
            response = wc.DownloadString(url)

Thanks!
","PKCS#12 is a standard made by RSA for PKI (public key infrastructure). This consists of a tree of certificates and their accompanying keys. Your PKCS#12 contains one leaf certificate and its key, possibly together with some higher up certificates (it's an upside down tree).
PGP, which is used by Seahorse is a different way of handling public/private keys, based on a web of trust (google it). It is not directly compatible with PKI(X) which you have now. You could extract the key and generate a PGP key out of it, but you would have to reestablish trust anyway, so you might as well use a different key pair...

"4575101","Serial number generation algorithm for C# application","I am  developing a shareware c# application which accepts a serial key generated in my website.
I am following  the following approach suggested by Joseph Spiros

You bundle your public key with the application.
  When the user buys the application, they supply their name and e-mail address.
  The web site hashes the user's name and e-mail address, signs the hash with your private >key, and provides the result in Base64 to ease typing.
  When the user enters the ""code"" into your application along with their name and e-mail >address, your application can verify that it was signed by your private key (which only >you/the web store has access to), and that it matches the name and e-mail provided by the >user.

My website runs on linux server so that the program generating the licence will be written in php. The software is developed using  c#. Please tell me whether the licence/hash generated and signed using a private key in php will be compatible with the public key in C#.
A pointer to an example would be helpful.

Now although the above produces a very similar output but it is not the right one. Why? Because when the output of the java code above is sent to the backend, I receive a HTTP 200 OK and the expected response. 
However, when the output of the python code above is sent similarly to the backend, I receive a 500 internal server error, meaning (as per my assumption, given that all the other params, headers etc. remain exactly the same between the java and the python HTTP requests) the input to the backend was not correct and hence it broke (again please ignore the 500, I agree it should be something more meaningful and definitely not a 500)
I do not have access to the backend. It is more of a red team - blue team exercise we are doing
Also, I could possibly invoke the java code above from python and still manage to achieve the end result and get the work done, but that'd be more of a hack, which would although be sufficient, but I am more interested in knowing how exactly can I achieve the same with Python alone.
As per some suggestions in the comments below I tried this as well:
So I tried this as well:
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_v1_5

def encryptMsg(secret):
    message = secret
    key = RSA.importKey(open('myPubkey.pem').read())
    cipher = PKCS1_v1_5.new(key)
    ciphertext = b64encode(cipher.encrypt(message))
    return ciphertext

and then in the while loop, this:
localStringBuilder1 = localStringBuilder1 + encryptMsg(str(localObject)) + ':::'

Still doesn't seem to work. Same results as before.

Details of context: I am attempting to implement a password strength checking function on both the client and server side of an app, but using only code on the server side. To achieve this on the client side, I want to send the putative password to the server, judge its strength, and then return a score which is displayed on the client. This means I only have to maintain password strength checking code on the server. As an extra security measure, I am encrypting the putative password using the cryptico.js library before sending it to the server to be judged.
","BigInteger and RSAParameter classes store numbers in different format.
BigInteger stores numbers as little-endian - this means that if you create a BigInteger
to hold hex number 0xABCD (43981) - ToByteArray will return bytes {0xCD, 0xAB, 0x00} (more on extra zero later).
RSAParameter was designed to store numbers in big-endian format.
It means that bytes {0xCD, 0xAB, 0x00} written into, for example, Exponent property, will be interpreted
by RSA implementation as number 0xCDAB00 (13478656).
To make matters more complicated - RSAParameters are always positive numbers, while BigInteger supports sign.
and same number, 0xFF - will be interpreted differently. For RSA, it is decimal 255. for BigInteger it means -1,
since it is interpreting most significant bit as a sign. 
This is why zero is added - at construction time, BigInteger is aware that we are passing positive value, 43981.
But storing this value as two bytes would produce negative number (-21555), since highest bit is set for byte 0xCD (11001101 in binary).
So BigInteger adds zero to indicate positive number. Try it yourself:
Console.WriteLine(new BigInteger(new byte[]{0xCD,0xAB}));
Console.WriteLine(BitConverter.ToString(new BigInteger(0xABCD).ToByteArray()));

So, we have large integer passed to us as a decimal string ""1234567..."", and we want to convert it to representation used by RSA.
In order to do this, we would need:

Parse string to BigInteger.
Extract BigInteger bytes.
Make sure BigInteger did not add any leading zeros to compensate sign.
Reverse array back to big endian form, and feed to RSA.

At this point it hangs. Does anyone with any OpenSSL experience know why this is happening to me? Please keep in mind I have never used OpenSSL before so I might be overlooking something simple, which is why I hope someone can point me in the right direction.
I appreciate any suggestions! Thanks!
","You're missing an -in in the first half of the command, which is subsequently trying to read data from standard input (and thus hanging).
The correct command line should be

","In rsaSign method, do the following after line s.update(data);,
byte[] signature = s.sign();
Log.e(""s.sign()"", Base64.encodeToString(signature , Base64.DEFAULT));    
return signature;

Remember, A call to sign() method resets the signature object to the state it was in when previously initialized for signing via a call to initSign(PrivateKey). That is, the object is reset and available to generate another signature from the same signer, if desired, via new calls to update and sign.
Now, in the rsaVerify method, replace the line 
success = s.verify(Base64.decode(signature, Base64.DEFAULT));
 with,
success = s.verify(signature);

I have a public key and private key pair in the KeyStore.
How do I know if the public key in the certificate matches with the private key in the key store?

Since the Keystore contains pairs, you look for the pair that has the same public key as the certificate.
Of course that is just the first step.  Next you (or more likely, the PKI library) needs to use the private key to check the certificate's signature.

The man in the middle received this CA public key but then sends me a public key and fake certificate of his own and pretends that it is valid. I use this key to compute the certificate signature to verify it but if this key is fake, how can I know certificate is not from a trusted source?
","In order for any PKI to work, each party should have a list of public keys for CA they trust. These keys have been obtained out of band, securely, from a software vendor.
The SSL certificate (containing the SSL server's public key) received from the server is signed by the private key of one of AC. There is no way to forge a valid certificate without access to one of the CA's private key, so the man in the middle can not send a forged one that  will look valid.
The is two things that we need trust in order to use PKI :
1/ that we can securely retrieve the CA's public keys
2/ that the CA won't mess up by signing forged certificates or by getting their keys stolen.

What exactly is in id_rsa? If I cat it

In general, I'm trying to connect the theory of RSA with the actual practice as implemented through the ssh program on Unix machines.  Any answers or pointers to the right direction would be greatly appreciated.
","id_rsa is a base64-encoded DER-encoded string. The ASN.1 syntax for that DER-encoded string is described in RFC3447 (aka PKCS1):
  Version ::= INTEGER { two-prime(0), multi(1) }

The 30 is because it's a SEQUENCE tag. The 82025c represents the length. The first byte means the length is of the ""long form"" (82 & 80) and that the next two bytes represent the length (82 & 7F). So the actual length of the SEQUENCE is 025c. So after that is the value.
Then you get to the version. 02 is of type int, 01 is the tag length and 00 is the value. ie. it's a two-prime key as opposed to a multi-prime key.
More info on the Distinguished Encoding Rules.
Trying to understand ASN.1 is a lot more complicated and a lot of it, for the purpose of understanding the formatting of RSA private keys, is unnecessary. For X.509 it becomes more necessary but RSA keys aren't nearly as complicated, formatting-wise, as X.509 certs.
Hope that helps!

"27555557","Opening encrypted emails with c#","I'm working in Visual Studio 2012 to build a relatively simple add-in for Outlook 2010.  Machines are Win 7 Enterprise 32 and 64.  The purpose of the add-in is to decrypt email messages directly in the user's inbox so that they can be easily searched in .pst archives or saved to network folders as .msg files unencrypted.  The emails are encrypted using the x.509 PKI with the private keys stored on a smart card which prompts the user for a PIN each time an encrypted email is opened.  This is what I have so far:
private void buttonDecrypt_Click(object sender, RibbonControlEventArgs e)    {
  currentExplorer = Globals.ThisAddIn.Application.ActiveExplorer();
  if (currentExplorer.Selection.Count > 0)      {
    for (int i = 0; i < currentExplorer.Selection.Count; i++)        {
      Object selObject = currentExplorer.Selection[i+1];
      if (selObject is Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.MailItem)          {
        Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.MailItem mailItem = 
          (selObject as Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.MailItem);      
        mailItem.PropertyAccessor.SetProperty(""http://schemas.microsoft.com/mapi/proptag/0x6E010003"", 0);
        mailItem.Save();
      }                    
    }                
  }
}

If I manually open an encrypted email in Outlook, I get prompted for my PIN which allows the email to open fine.  Then if I close the email and hit my new button on the ribbon it does exactly what I want by re-saving the email unencrypted directly in my inbox.  However, if I select more than one email at once, or don't open the message manually first, my code errors on mailItem.PropertyAccessor.Setproperty() with message COMException was unhandled by user code: Your Digital ID name cannot be found by the underlying security system.  This tells me I need a way to prompt the user for their PIN prior to attempting to open the email.
","I don't think there is much you can do using the Outlook Object Model alone. OOM tries very hard to represent signed or encrypted messages as regular IPM.Note items. It goes as far as exposing a fake IMessage MAPI object from the MailItem.MAPIOBJECT property.
When you set the PR_SECURITY_FLAGS property, Outlook knows to decrypt the message. There is no way to specify how the decryption will be done or provide any parameters. That property is nothing but a hack to encrypt / decrypted Outlook messages; it only works when the property is set using MailItem.PropertyAccessor.
Ultimately what you need is the data from the P7M attachment stored by the encrypted/signed message. You can see this in OutlookSpy: if you click the IMessage button on the OutlookSpy toolbar (it uses MailItem.MAPIOBJECT), you will see the regular decrypted message. But if you click the IMAPISecureMesage in the IMessage window or open the message from the IMAPIFolder | GetContentsTable tab, you will see the raw encrypted message and its P7M attachment.
To extract that attachment, you will need either Extended MAPI (C++ or Delphi) or a wrapper like Redemption (use RDOSession.GetMessageFromID). Redemption also exposes the RDOEncryptedMesage object that can be used for decryption .

"14220340","How to read RSA public and private keys into single RSA struct?","What I'm trying to do is generate random RSA keys and then store them before my program terminates.  This part is working just fine using RSA_generate_key, PEM_write_bio_RSAPrivateKey and PEM_write_bio_RSA_PUBKEY.  I can also encrypt/decrypt just find using the RSA structure returned by RSA_generate_key.  
However, my problem comes when my program restarts and I want to read back in the keys that I stored previously.  I can use PEM_read_bio_RSAPrivateKey and PEM_read_bio_RSA_PUBKEY to pull the keys in, but I need to get them into the same RSA structure, similar to how they are stored by RSA_generate_key.
My code is shown below.  I have the keys stored in memory along with a small header that tell me how large the keys are.  The private key start right after the header and the public key is stored right after the private key.
privateKey = (uint8_t *) ( buffer + rsaStruct->hdrSize );
publicKey = (uint8_t *) ( privateKey + rsaStruct->privateKeyLength );

bioPrivate = BIO_new_mem_buf( (void *) privateKey, rsaStruct->privateKeyLength );
bioPublic = BIO_new_mem_buf( (void *) publicKey, rsaStruct->publicKeyLength );

bioPrivate = BIO_new_mem_buf( (void *) privateKey, rsaStruct->privateKeyLength + rsaStruct->publicKeyLength );
if( bioPrivate == NULL || bioPublic == NULL ) {
    fprintf( stderr, ""%s: BIO_new_mem_buf failed!\n"", __FUNCTION__ );
    return ECE_RSA_ERROR_BIO_CREATION_FAILED;
}

PEM_read_bio_RSAPrivateKey( bioPrivate, &keyPair, NULL, NULL );
PEM_read_bio_RSA_PUBKEY( bioPublic, &keyPair, NULL, NULL );

BIO_free( bioPrivate );
BIO_free( bioPublic );

If I try to just send in the same RSA structure, it doesn't seem to work.  I'm able to encrypt just fine, but my decryption fails.  This could likely be due to the fact that the public key is the last key retrieve and the one used for encryption.  If the second call over-writes the address of my RSA struct, I would end up with an RSA structure that has nothing but the public key.
Anyway, if anyone could tell me how to get both the public and private key into the same RSA structure, that would be great!
","Comparing to RSA private key, public key additionaly contains only the public exponent. So just copy it from public key to private key structure, and everything should work.

Update:
From what I can tell, (looking at the ASCII Armored output for both the public key and the private key) it looks like they are structured this way:

Update 2:
Looked at the files again, and this is what I've got, I haven't pulled out a hex editor yet to verify the non armored files, but I've found surprisingly little help online about how these key files are internally structured:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 

4    header chars ??
1517 pub key chars
4    footer chars ??
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

and
-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
Version:

4    different header chars from pub key ??
700  pub key chars
1772 private key chars (possibly some header/footer to do with the symmetric cipher)
817  pub key chars (same total 1517, exact same ASCII sequence if put together)
4    different footer chars from pub key ??
-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----

Update 3:
Took a look at the binary pub/private keys and found that:

public key is 1138 bytes


4 unique bytes
1134 bytes found in private key as well

private key is 2467 bytes


4 unique bytes
524 of which are found verbatim in the public key
1329 of which are unique to the private key
38 bytes which are found verbatim in the public key (key name & Email address)
572 bytes which are found verbatim in the public key

","There are a few errors here.  First when you're reading and encrypting:
red = fread(msg, 1, RSA_size(keypair)-42, in);
if((RSA_public_encrypt(RSA_size(keypair)-42, (unsigned char*)msg, (unsigned char*)encrypt,
                                     keypair, RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING)) == -1) {

A call to fread won't necessarily read the number of bytes asked for, and could return 0.  So when you reach the end of the file, you man be encrypting more bytes than you need.  So pass in red for the number of bytes to encrypt.  Also, first check if red is 0 and if so break out of the loop:
red = fread(msg, 1, RSA_size(keypair)-42, in);
if (red == 0) break;
if(((red=RSA_public_encrypt(RSA_size(keypair)-42, (unsigned char*)msg, (unsigned char*)encrypt,
                                     keypair, RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING))) == -1) {

Note that we're saving the return value of RSA_public_encrypt.  That comes into play here where you're writing the encrypted data to disk:
if(fwrite(encrypt, 1, strlen(encrypt), out) == 1)

encrypt is an array of characters, not a string.  This means it's not NULL terminated, and it might contain NULL bytes.  So you can't use strlen.  Instead, capture the return value of RSA_public_encrypt and pass that as the size to write:
if(fwrite(encrypt, 1, red, out) == 1)

Because we're checking the return value of fread to break out of the loop, this isn't needed:
if(feof(in))
{
    break;
}

See this post regarding the perils of using feof.
Then there's this when you're reading back the encrypted data:
 red = fread(msg, 1, 256, in);
 if(RSA_private_decrypt(red, (unsigned char*)msg, (unsigned char*)decrypt,
                       keypair, RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING) == -1) {

RSA_private_decrypt expects a single encrypted block whose length is RSA_size(keypair).  So read in that many bytes from disk and pass in that many bytes to the function.  Also, check the return value of fread and break out if you don't get the expected amount, and capture the return value of RSA_private_decrypt:
 red = fread(msg, 1, RSA_size(keypair), in);
 if (red < RSA_size(keypair)) break;
 if((red=RSA_private_decrypt(red, (unsigned char*)msg, (unsigned char*)decrypt,
                       keypair, RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING)) == -1) {

Later when you write the decrypted data to disk:
fwrite(decrypt, 1, strlen(decrypt), out);

While what was decrypted is probably a string (if your input file was plain text), the returned data is not NULL terminated, so explicitly write than many bytes instead of using strlen:
fwrite(decrypt, 1, red, out);

Finally, as with the encryption loop, this is not needed in the decryption loop:
if(feof(in))
{
    break;
}

With these fixes applied, you should get the expected results.

","An advantage of using JCE mechanisms is that it is something of a standard, so you may use any of several providers to work with depending on your needs. You will find many JCE providers, commercial and free, that cover much of the crypto spectrum. There might even be some hardware (HSM) support through a proprietary JCE provider, though I don't know that for a fact.
Some advantages of completely avoiding the JCE and using the Bouncycastle lightweight API (BC LWAPI) exclusively are:

No additional policy files are needed to make any of the cryptography work. E.g. you can use AES-256 without requiring users to download the unlimited jurisdiction policy files.
The BC LWAPI is supported on the JME (formerly J2ME) environment. The JCE is not.
Many more cryptographic primitives are supported in the BC LWAPI.

EDIT:

Say you have parties A, B and C. A has two pieces of information, I1 and I2, in this case they are single integers. All parties have a secret, that they chose themselves, As, Bs and Cs, also integers in this case.
So first A ""encrypts"" the information by adding it's secret and sends this to B.
A  -- I1+As --> B
A  -- I2+As --> B

Now B selects which of the pieces of information to give to C, say in this case that it is I1. B adds its secret to it, so that it is hidden from A. Now B sends this back to A and A relays the information to C.
A <-- I1+As+Bs -- B
A  -- I1+As+Bs --> C

Now C adds its secret also, and sends it to A who relays it to B.
A <-- I1+As+Bs+Cs -- C
A  -- I1+As+Bs+Cs --> B

B removes its secret by subtraction, and sends it to A. A also removes its secret and sends it to C.

So C can subtract its secret, and is left with the information I1. A knows the values of I1 and I2, but doesn't know which one C has. B knows that C has information I1, but doesn't know the value of it. Can you see some flaw here? And would it be possible to adopt to proper public key encryption somehow?
","The problem with the chaining you have described is that every time you encrypt a chunk of data with a public key, you are ""wrapping"" it in encryption that ONLY that person (or whoever has access to the private key) can decrypt.

"28537832","Do I need to seed any random number generator before using EVP_PKEY_keygen of OpenSSL?","On the OpenSSL Wiki page called EVP Key and Parameter Generation it states the following:

Since these functions use random numbers you should ensure that the random number generator is appropriately seeded

But nowhere on EVP_PKEY_keygen does it make mention of seeding a random number generator. It only discusses the low-level doc pages for non-EVP functions for generating keys.
I have also searched and everywhere no mention is made of seeding when the EVP functions are used.
So my question is; May I assume that the seeding is done internally for me in the higher-level EVP functions?
If I do need to do it then which functions must I have a look at?
","
but nowhere on https://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/EVP_PKEY_keygen.html it makes any mention of seeding a random number generator....

See the OpenSSL wiki page Random Numbers. It takes you through it in grueling detail.


... no mention is made of seeding when the EVP functions are used

The EVP functions use whatever generator is in use for the library. It could be md_rand or a FIPS AES/CTR generator. There's nothing special to get random numbers for the EVP functions (as opposed to other functions).


May I assume that the seeding is done internally for me in the higher-level EVP functions?

Yes, if you did not seed the generator yourself. If you seeded the generator and there's sufficient entropy, then it will not auto-seed itself.
You should avoid allowing the generator to auto-seed itself. See the OpenSSL wiki page Random Numbers for the details.
There's nothing special about seeding/auto-seeding a generator when using EVP interfaces. Whatever you do applies to everything.


If I do need to do it then which functions must I have a look at?

The OpenSSL wiki page Random Numbers provides more details, but you should do something like:
int rc = RAND_load_file(""/dev/urandom"", 32);
if(rc != 32) {
    /* RAND_load_file failed */
}

/* OK to proceed */

You want to avoid a direct call to RAND_poll, and you want to avoid auto-seeding (which calls RAND_poll internally).

","I think that there are 2 problems:

2) Next error will give you that pointer in uninitialized, I think you can use code like this:

    if(challenge.protectionSpace.authenticationMethod == NSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrust) {
        var localTrust: UnsafeMutablePointer<SecTrust?> = nil

        let localCertificate = SecCertificateCreateWithData(kCFAllocatorDefault, certificateData!)

            let localTrustRef = localTrust

"10889491","Best practices for personal private keys","I'm just starting to use RSA keys in my daily work, and I have a few questions regarding the best ways to use them.
The biggest question revolves around the idea of multiple clients and multiple servers. Here's a scenario:
I have two client computers:

Desktop
Laptop

And there are two servers which I will be authenticating:

My own local server
Remote service (e.g. Github)

So, generally, how many key-pairs would you recommend in this situation?

One key-pair: This key is ""Me"" and I use it everywhere.
One per client: This key is ""This client"" and I put it on each server I mean to connect to from that client.
One key-pair per server: This is the key ""for this service"", and I bring the private key to each client I want to connect to it from.
One for every combination: Every unique client-server pairing has its own key-pair.

If none of these is significantly superior or worse to any other, can you outline the pros and cons of each so that a person could choose for themselves?
","The usual way to do this is your ""One per client"" option. That way, in case of a compromised client key, you can revoke just that key from the servers where it is allowed. If you want extra work, you can do ""One for every combination"".
The above options avoid copying private key data between hosts.

","Of your four options, the two I like are:

One per client: This key is ""This client"" and I put it on each server I mean to connect to from that client.
This gives you the easy ability to revoke all keys for a specific client in the event it is compromised -- delete the one key on every service. It also only scales linearly in the number of clients, which will probably make key management easier. It even fits neatly with the OpenSSH key model, which is to give every client one key that is used on multiple servers. (You can do other models with OpenSSH, which is nice. But this is the easiest thing to do as it happens without any effort on your part.)
One for every combination: Every unique client-server pairing has its own key-pair.
This has the downside of forcing you to revoke multiple keys when a single client is compromised, but it'll be one key per service anyway, so it isn't significantly worse. The better upside is that it'll be significantly harder for one service to serve as a middleman between you and another service. This is not a real concern most of the time, but if your (Laptop,Server,SMTP) key were suddenly being used for (Laptop,Server,SSH), you'd have some opportunity to notice the oddity. I'm not sure this ability is worth the quadratic increase in keys to manage.

","CKM_RSA_PKCS refers to the PKCS#1 v1.5 standard (see RFC3447) for RSA encryption and digital signatures. In Java JCE, it is typically the default choice for RSA.

For digital signatures, pass ""MD5WithRSA"", ""SHA1WithRSA"", etc to Signature.getInstance()
For encryption, pass ""RSA/None/PKCS1Padding"" to Cipher.getInstance().

CKM_RSA_X_509 refers to the textbook (or raw) RSA algorithm, that is, the one where no padding is defined. In this case, you can simply pass ""RSA/None/NoPadding"" to Cipher.getInstance(). Signature can be done with decryption, wheres verification can be done with encryption (followed by comparison).
I would avoid implementing and using raw RSA though, unless you have specific use cases in mind. PKCS#1v 1.5 signatures are more secure. For enciphering though, I wouldn't actually recommend to use either of them, because they are both unsecure. It's better to rely only on PKCS#1 OAEP (CKM_RSA_PKCS_OAEP); for that, you pass ""RSA/None/OAEPWithSHA1AndMGF1Padding"" to Cipher.getInstance().

That depends on your requirements and threat model. The signature generation of RSACryptoServiceProvider should be explicitly set to a hash other than MD5 or SHA-1. It's not clear from your question if this has taken place.

If I use this method to import keys
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/tswxhw92(v=vs.110).aspx
GetKeyFromContainer(""MyKeyContainer"");
Is MyKeyContainer private and public keys static?

Yes, that's the general idea of using a key store anyway.

At each run, Can I have same private key/public key? Or should I have different key set each time I generate a signature?

Yes you can, given that you use an ample key size, say 2048 bit or higher.

Actually, for your solution to be secure the receiver needs to trust the public key. When no trust is established, anybody could send you their public key instead.

","The easy answer is, use TLS.
If you've implemented your server interface as a web API, then this is as simple as configuring your web server front-end to accept connections over HTTPS.  Your web server (and the browser / HTTPS client library on the client side) will then take care of most of the complicated handshaking, authentication and encryption details for you.
TLS is far from a perfect security protocol, but if used properly, it generally does the job, and it does it with much less hassle or opportunities for mistakes than designing your own protocol would.

If you really want to ""roll your own"" secure communications scheme, you're first going to have to familiarize yourself with the theory of cryptography and the various available algorithms.  In particular, to implement an effective hybrid cryptosystem, you're going to need:

an authenticated public-key based key agreement protocol (preferably something based on the Diffie–Hellman key exchange, and thus providing forward secrecy) to provide the client and server with a temporary shared key;
an authenticated symmetric encryption algorithm, to provide a secure channel between the client and the server using the shared key; and
if the data is transmitted as discrete messages within the secure channel, a communications protocol capable of detecting message replay attacks (e.g. through the use of sequential message numbers).

While all of these can be implemented using only a few discrete crypto primitives — a block cipher (e.g. AES), a public-key encryption/signature algorithm (e.g. RSA), and possibly a hash function (e.g. SHA-256) and some way to do modular exponentiation for Diffie–Hellman — it's generally easier to use protocols and schemes that you crypto library already implements a high-level interface for.
Unfortunately, the most widely implemented schemes also tend to be the older ones, which may be slower and have weaker security guarantees than more modern schemes.  That said, if I had the choice (and keep in mind that I'm by no means a true crypto expert), here's what I'd pick:

If the client needs to authenticate itself using a password, I'd pick SRP for the key agreement protocol.  If both sides have public signature keys known to the other, the problem is somewhat simpler, and could be handled simply by using raw Diffie–Hellman and then having both parties sign the D–H shared secret, or by using something like STS.  (Note that, even with SRP, you may still want the server to authenticate itself to the client using something stronger than just knowledge of the client's password verifier.)
For the signature algorithm, any of RSA (with proper padding), DSA or ECDSA should do, as long as the key length is sufficient.  (What counts as sufficient depends on the algorithm.)  Where hash algorithms are required, I would, for now, use SHA-2; once the SHA-3 standard is finalized, it should also be a valid choice.
For the symmetric encryption part, I'd go with SIV (RFC 5297) for maximum fool-proofness, or with GCM if speed is critical or ""on-line"" encryption of large messages is required (and you don't have to implement it yourself).  OCB could also be an option, if the patent exemptions are enough for your purposes, and EAX is perfectly good too, if not the absolute fastest.  See also How to choose an Authenticated Encryption mode.
Generic composition of a block cipher (e.g. in CTR mode) and a MAC would also work, as long you make sure to apply the MAC to the message after encryption (end verify it before decryption).  Any decent MAC should do, but HMAC is generally a safe and robust choice, if you have a good hash function available and don't need extreme speed.  (If you do, a fast Carter–Wegman MAC like poly1305-AES may be worth considering.) Try to avoid the old CBC-MAC if you can; CMAC is much better.
In any case, I see no good reason to choose anything other than AES for the underlying block cipher at the moment, although it's always good to design your protocol so that new cipher options may be easily introduced (and old insecure ones deprecated) in the future.
To derive the symmetric encryption key(s) from the D–H / SRP shared secret, you'll generally need a key derivation function; HKDF (RFC 5869) is a good choice for this job, especially if you already use a hash function anyway.  (It shouldn't be used — alone, at least — for hashing passwords, though; for that, you need a key-stretching KDF like PBKDF2 or scrypt.)
Also, as noted, I would design my communications protocol so that all messages carry a sequential message number and explicit sender/receiver designations, and so that messages with duplicate message numbers or invalid designations are discarded as forgeries.  Conveniently, these message numbers + designators can also be used as nonces for the symmetric encryption protocol (possibly after hashing, if they would otherwise be too long).
These message numbers and designators don't necessarily have to be encrypted (although they do need to be authenticated as ""associated data""); not encrypting them has the advantage that you can immediately reject any messages with bogus numbers or designators, even before attempting decryption.
Finally, always keep in mind that there may be exploitable gaps in what I've suggested above, or in the way you choose to apply my suggestions.  Make sure to get as many competent security experts as possible to review your protocol and implementation before you use it for anything actually important.

As for specific crypto libraries or APIs in the various languages you mention, I'm not particularly familiar with those, and thus cannot offer detailed advice.  Just look at the documentation of standard crypto libraries and see what they offer.

","The problem is the limited precision of Javascript numbers that causes rounding errors in your code where you first exponentiate and then calculate the modulus. For your example numbers, you could fix this by periodically calculating the modulus inside the exponentiation, e.g. by never calculating more than a square before taking the modulus. But for actual cryptography your calculations will involve numbers too big to be handled as Javascript numbers (and most programming languages pose the same problem). The usual approach is to use a large integer (or even arbitrary precision) library. If you do end up implementing your own cryptography, please watch out for side channels, e.g. by calling library functions that are not constant time or allow cache-based attacks by using data dependent array indices.

","3^54 is 58149737003040059690390169. It causes an overflow, therefore you should implement modular exponentation, since i don't know javascript too well i have written a c code which should be easy to implement in javascript :
int power(int a, int b, int prime){
      int result;
      if(b == 0){
           result = 1;
      }else if(b == 1){
           result = a % prime;
      }else if(b % 2 == 0){
           result = power((a*a) % prime, b/2, prime);
           result = result % prime;
      }else{
           result = power((a*a) % prime, b/2, prime);
           result = (result * a) % prime;
      }
  return result;
  }

Now you can call this function :
int value = power(3, 54, 17);

and it should work.

","Certificates are not normally generated by the application (since PKI is about trust, which is hierarchical in case of certificates). Users acquire certificates with private keys (let's say so for simplicity) and store them in the safe place or on hardware devices (smartcards, USB tokens). 
Then those certificates are used to sign information. In case of web application you can either transfer the data itself to the client or send a hash of the data there, but in any case signing takes place on the client side (except rare cases where certificates are stored on central server and access to them is authorized by the client each time the certificate is used). 
We offer components for distributed signing of data. This answer contains detailed description of how such signing works. You can use our solution or create your own, that will do the same.

I am unsure how to properly encode the public key, any and all help is much appreciated.
","The following code generates the keys and everything works as expected, but your hard coding a public key which won't work for the private key which gets been generated:
<?php     
$config = array(
    ""digest_alg"" => ""sha512"",
    ""private_key_bits"" => 4096,
    ""private_key_type"" => OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_RSA,
);

// Create the private and public key
$res = openssl_pkey_new($config);

// Extract the private key from $res to $privKey
openssl_pkey_export($res, $privKey);

// Extract the public key from $res to $pubKey
$pubKey = openssl_pkey_get_details($res);
$pubKey = $pubKey[""key""];

$data = 'plaintext data goes here';

// Encrypt the data to $encrypted using the public key
openssl_public_encrypt($data, $encrypted, $pubKey);

// Decrypt the data using the private key and store the results in $decrypted
openssl_private_decrypt($encrypted, $decrypted, $privKey);

echo $decrypted;
?>

Instead you should be doing the following to test, generate your keys then hardcode both:

The requirements are that the app on the phone be able to communicate with the server without the user entering any credentials.  My goal here is to prevent examination of the parameters in the URL and abuse of our system through spoofing.  Thus all copies of our app in the wild can look like the same user for purposes of encryption.
I haven't been planning to use HTTPS, because (if I'm not mistaken) it needs sessions or certificates and it seems excessive (but let me know if not); I just need to encrypt and decrypt the parameter portion of the URL.
Since the data to encrypt with an RSA public key must be shorter than the key, the standard procedure is to generate a symmetric private key, encrypt that with the public key, encrypt the data with the generated private key, and then send the generated private key and the encrypted data to the server.  It looks like I have most of what I need to encrypt the generated key (except RSA_size() crashes in the process).  But I don't know how to specify and set up the encoding of the bulk data with Blowfish or some other algorithm supported by PHP.
Thanks for any insight.
","I think, and I'm not very sure - if you need to encrypt data to send and you are not being connected via HTTPS, then you can try to implement some JS encryption module. (I have found http://www.hanewin.net/encrypt/) You can generate the keys based up on username or client pc's name.

It looks like I have most of what I need to encrypt the generated key (except RSA_size() crashes in the process).  But I don't know how to specify and set up the encoding of the bulk data with Blowfish or some other algorithm supported by PHP.
Thanks for any insight.
","Another possibility is not to use a public/private key encryption, but to do symmetric-key encryption.  What you would probably want to do is each session have the client app generate a key, use a single HTTPS connection to send that key which the server can use to decrypt parameters.  Now all of your regular connections can just have the encrypted parameter using that key that only the client and server know.  It should be unique per device and probably session.  You might want to associate a time stamp with it, so that you know that after it has been inactive for however long it can be discarded, or seen as coming from an invalid session.

My goal here is to prevent examination of the parameters in the URL and abuse of our system through spoofing.  Thus all copies of our app in the wild can look like the same user for purposes of encryption.

","This is possible.
You can just use the RSA pubic key cryptographic algorithms, without any of the overheads and infrastructure that PGP or X.509v3 wraps around them.

Generate a public-private key pair.
Store the private key securely on the server.  Protect it well.
Distribute the public key to the iPhone app.
The iPhone app encrypts the data using the public key.
The iPhone app sends the encrypted data to the server.
The server decrypts the encrypted data using the private key.

You can play around with this idea using the openssl command line tools:
On the server run:
$ openssl genrsa -out myprivatekey.pem 2048
$ openssl rsa -in myprivatekey.pem -pubout -out mypublickey.pem

Copy the mypublickey.pem to the client, and on the client create some data in data.dat and run:
$ openssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin -inkey mypublickey.pem -in data.dat -out enc.dat

Send the enc.dat to the server, and then on the server run:
$ openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey myprivatekey.pem -in enc.data -out data2.dat

The public key does not have to be protected, so you can distribute it to the iPhone app in any way you want.  For example, embed it into the app, put it on a public Web server, send it to the client by insecure email. There's no problem if the bad guys get their hands on it.
Note: in the example I've created a 2048 bit RSA key.  Keep in mind that you need longer bit length keys for asymmetric algorithms (i.e. public-key algorithms) to achieve the same level of security as keys used for symmetric algorithms.  Don't go thinking that 128 bit AES encryption is very strong, so I'll just create a 128 bit RSA key -- that is way too short for an RSA key and will not give you the security strength you expect.
Now you just need to implement that by calling the openSSL libraries in code.

","First of all it might be better to go straight for SHA512, SHA is notoriously easy to crack with GPU's, thus upping the memory scale a bit is not a bad idea.
Second, using CommonCrypto it is actually extremely easy to generate HMAC's, this is the implementation that I use:
static func hmac(_ secretKey: inout [UInt8], cipherText: inout [UInt8], algorithm: CommonCrypto.HMACAlgorithm = .sha512) -> [UInt8] {
        var mac = [UInt8](repeating: 0, count: 64)
        CCHmac(algorithm.value, &secretKey, secretKey.count, &cipherText, cipherText.count, &mac)
        return mac
    }

Where the algorithm is defined as such:
enum HMACAlgorithm {
        case sha512

        var value: UInt32 {
            switch(self) {
            case .sha512:
                return UInt32(kCCHmacAlgSHA512)
            }
        }
    }

My cipher text is cipherText+IV in this instance. When you are not using AES-GCM it seems suggested / recommended to HMAC IV+Cipher, but I cannot give you the technical details as to why.
Converting Data or NSData to a byte array:
var byteArray = data.withUnsafeBytes { [UInt8](UnsafeBufferPointer(start: $0, count: data.count) }

The reason for using an array is a substantial performance increase over Data, I don't know what the core team is doing but Data performs worse than NSMutableData even.

","Swift 3/4:
HMAC with MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 (Swift 3)

These functions will hash either String or Data input with one of eight cryptographic hash algorithms.

Supported functions are MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512
This example requires Common Crypto
It is necessary to have a bridging header to the project:
#import <CommonCrypto/CommonCrypto.h>
Add the Security.framework to the project.  
These functions takes a hash name, message to be hashed, a key and return a digest:

Can anyone explain this behaviour?
","That is expected.
The RSA cryptosystem works in group modulo some prime number. To ensure that all possible plaintexts are encrypted with the same security, the plaintexts are padded to produce a padded plaintext that is slightly smaller than the modulus. Since the padding is applied before encryption, the ciphertext looks completely different.
JSEncrypt is based on JSBN which in turn implements only PKCS#1 v1.5 padding type 2 (RFC 2313). The second type of this padding introduces random bytes that are removed after decryption because of marker bytes. At least 11 bytes are needed for the padding.
If you want to check the interoperability with other implementations, you need to do a full encryption-decryption cycle and make sure that you get the same plaintext back.
Note that nowadays, PKCS#1 v1.5 padding shouldn't be used anymore and PKCS#1 v.2 OAEP is preferred which is also randomized.

","There are different encoding schemes in OpenPGP, namely

binary data and
ASCII armored data.

Especially for key exchange, normally the ASCII armored format is preferred as it is more robust and easy to recognize. For mail exchange, it is mandatory (for 7 bit compatibility). The binary version also has advantages, especially regarding performance and storage (bandwith) requirements.
For example, GnuPG will use the binary encoding by default, unless you request the ASCII armored version using the option --ascii or abbreviated -a.
It look like your code is outputting the binary encoding, but works all fine.
You can easily test by trying to decrypt (eg. using GnuPG: gpg --decrypt file.pgp). Alternatively, you can dump the OpenPGP packets the file contains by using gpg --list-packets file.pgp or using the more verbose utility pgpdump, which is available in most (unix) package repositories: pgpdump file.pgp. Unlike gpg --list-packets, it also resolves packet and algorithm identifiers to human readable strings (where gpg --list-packets just dumps their numeric IDs).

I would appreciate any guidance, advice, or assistance in helping me get this resolved.
","What you asked for:
The NullReferenceException is caused by your exception handler in DecodeRSAPrivateKey returning null, but the caller not checking for it.
Your decode needs to be adjusted a bit for DER encoding vs CAPI encoding concerns (.NET has inherited the CAPI encoding restrictions):
1) The leading byte of Modulus must not be 0x00.  (DER requires it to be inserted if the next byte is >= 0x80).  So if it's there, you need to trim it out.
2) The leading byte of Exponent must not be 0x00.  Probably not an issue since your exponent is probably [ 0x01, 0x00, 0x01 ], but it doesn't hurt to code defensively.
3) D must be exactly the same length as Modulus.  If D is too short you need to pad it (on ""the left"") with 0x00-values.  If it's one byte too long and starts with 0x00, remove the 0x00.
4) P.Length = (Modulus.Length + 1) / 2.  (RSA-1024 has Modulus.Length 128 and P.Length 64.  RSA-1032 has Modulus.Length 129 and P.Length 65).  Left pad with 0x00 as necessary.  If P is one byte too long and it starts with 0x00, remove the 0x00. (If it's too long still, then CAPI (and therefore .NET) cannot read this key from parameters; P and Q aren't of similar lengths)
5) Q.Length, DP.Length, DQ.Length, and InverseQ.Length must all equal P.Length.  Left pad with 0x00 as necessary, remove a leading 0x00 as necessary.
You also seem to be reading BEGIN PRIVATE KEY files (PKCS#8), but you're interpreting it like BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY (PKCS#1 RSAPrivateKey).  So you need to account for the header portions in the PrivateKeyInfo structure (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5208#section-5).
What you might want instead:
If you're really reading a PKCS#8, and you're on .NET Framework 4.6 or higher, just let CngKey and RSACng do the work for you:
RSA LoadKeyFile(string filename)
{
    using (System.IO.FileStream fs = System.IO.File.OpenRead(filename))
    {
        byte[] data = new byte[fs.Length];
        byte[] res = null;
        fs.Read(data, 0, data.Length);
        if (data[0] != 0x30)
        {
            res = GetPem(""PRIVATE KEY"", data);
        }

        try
        {
            using (CngKey key = CngKey.Import(res, CngKeyBlobFormat.Pkcs8PrivateBlob))
            {
                return new RSACng(key);
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""ex :"" + ex);
        }

        return null;
    }
}

Then you just need to change your calling code to stop caring that it got an RSACryptoServiceProvider, just that it's RSA:
public string RSASign(string data, string PhysicalApplicationPath)
{
    RSA rsa = LoadCertificateFile(PhysicalApplicationPath);
    byte[] dataBytes = System.Text.Encoding.Default.GetBytes(data);
    byte[] signatureBytes = rsa.SignData(dataBytes, HashAlgorithmName.SHA256, RSASignaturePadding.Pkcs1);
    return BitConverter.ToString(signatureBytes).Replace(""-"", null);
}

I left it as PKCS1 signature padding since that's what RSACryptoServiceProvider's method would have done.

","There are major differences between S/MIME (Cryptographic Message Syntax) and OpenPGP.
http://mozilla-enigmail.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=67
Mainly, S/MIME exchanges keys in terms of certificates (which must utilize a certificate authority, limited to 1024 bit, and expires after 1 year), while OpenPGP uses PGP keys (can be exchanged peer-to-peer, or utilize a free keyserver, or host your own keyserver).

","FIPS 140-2 doesn't apply to protocols like SSL, PGP, S/MIME, or SSH. Those are security protocols that use cryptographic algorithms like RSA and AES. (Commercial crypto vendors aren't likely to point out this distinction, however).
FIPS 140-2 lists approved algorithms. It also specifies testing criteria for ""cryptographic modules"" that implement these algorithms. But, it doesn't say anything about the application of these algorithms.
So, you can use BouncyCastle's PGP provider. Instead of installing Bouncy Castle as a crypto-provider, install your FIPS 140-2–certified implementation. Bouncy Castle's PGP will use the preferred crypto provider for its underlying cryptographic algorithms. You can use their S/MIME support in the same way.

Note that I am saying ""certificates stored on the client"" which is deliberately vague.  I dont want to restrict thoughts to system store, user store, browser store, cryptographic token, java key store, where ever.
Over the years, I used the following ways.  Along side each of them I give the pros and cons.

CAPICOM/ActiveX.  While this was the easiest to work with, it restricts the user to IE on Windows.  What is worse, it is now deprecated and works only on 32bit.
Java applet.  This is cross platform and cross browser, but java in the browser is not as common as one would like it to be and is quickly fading away (apparently Apple recently removed it).  So there is the added hassle of getting the user to download and install the JRE. Additionally users have to perform the relatively technical task of setting the unlimited strength cryptography extensions for the signer to work.

Things I have heard of/thought of but I have not progressed far

Most javascript solutions.  They implement the RSA algorithm but they dont have a way to access digital certificates on the client certificate store.  Most of them generate a new key pair.
Flash/Flex.  Flash/flex seem to be the most ubiquitous client side technology.  They can already access client hardware like cameras and microphones.  It would be lovely if they could access certificate stores.
Alternatives to CAPICOM as given on the microsoft website.  It prescribes alternatives to CAPICOM which are mostly do things using the .NET framework.  This is great for desktop clients.  But for ""scripts"" they say very clearly in an ""important note"" that you have to write your own activex controls.  Which takes us back to square one.

What I am looking for is a way to get over/around the primary problem of getting access to certificates stores on the client.  I am not looking for a discussion of the RSA algorithm or why PKI is stupid or some alternative to asymmetric encryption or use of architectures other than web applications, or on Apple.
","My best bet would still be an applet since that's possibly the most cross-platform thing.
Alternately, I can develop my own activeX and limiting my reach.
Remember that client side certificate access is big security thing.

CAPICOM/ActiveX.  While this was the easiest to work with, it restricts the user to IE on Windows.  What is worse, it is now deprecated and works only on 32bit.
Java applet.  This is cross platform and cross browser, but java in the browser is not as common as one would like it to be and is quickly fading away (apparently Apple recently removed it).  So there is the added hassle of getting the user to download and install the JRE. Additionally users have to perform the relatively technical task of setting the unlimited strength cryptography extensions for the signer to work.

Things I have heard of/thought of but I have not progressed far

Most javascript solutions.  They implement the RSA algorithm but they dont have a way to access digital certificates on the client certificate store.  Most of them generate a new key pair.
Flash/Flex.  Flash/flex seem to be the most ubiquitous client side technology.  They can already access client hardware like cameras and microphones.  It would be lovely if they could access certificate stores.
Alternatives to CAPICOM as given on the microsoft website.  It prescribes alternatives to CAPICOM which are mostly do things using the .NET framework.  This is great for desktop clients.  But for ""scripts"" they say very clearly in an ""important note"" that you have to write your own activex controls.  Which takes us back to square one.

What I am looking for is a way to get over/around the primary problem of getting access to certificates stores on the client.  I am not looking for a discussion of the RSA algorithm or why PKI is stupid or some alternative to asymmetric encryption or use of architectures other than web applications, or on Apple.

","[Disclosure: I work for CoSign]
A secure alternative to storing the certs on the clients is to store them on a secure, centralized SSCD (Secure Signature Creation Device). A problem with local certs (smart cards, etc) is to use them securely in client/server or web-based applications. 
A centralized SSCD takes care of the issue very neatly. The user still needs to authenticate himself to the SSCD, but the SSCD itself holds the certs and does the signing. The authentication step can include 2-factor authentication including One Time Passords (OTP), biometrics, etc. We have customers doing all that. 
The idea is to have secure client authentication but keep the secure signing centralized as a service on the network. 
See this description. Also available as a cloud-based solution.
ps, This answer covers the slightly more general question of how to securely sign in a web-based application. I agree that it does not cover the specific question of signing by using a user's smart card or client alternative (the OP was deliberately vague).

"18732113","BadPaddingException : Data must start with zero","I implemented data encryption/decryption with RSA. It works if I just encrypt/decrypt locally, however if I send my encrypted data I get BadPaddingException: Data must start with zero. 
In order to send my data over network I need to change it from byte array to String (I'm sending it in a header) on the client side and then retrieve it and change it back to byte array on the server side.
Here's my code for local encryption/decryption (I'm using private key to encrypt and public key do decrypt):
// Encryption:
String message = ""HELLO"";
Cipher rsa = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");
rsa.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, privateKey);  // privateKey has type java.security.PrivateKey
byte [] encryptedBytes = rsa.doFinal(message.getBytes());

// Decryption:
rsa.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, publicKey); // type of publicKey: java.security.PublicKey
byte [] ciphertext = rsa.doFinal(encryptedBytes);

String decryptedString = new String(ciphertext, ""UTF-8"");

DecryptedString and message are the same and everything works fine.
Then I use the same code on the client side just for encryption plus I change ciphertext to a String using:
String encryptedString = new String(ciphertext, ""UTF-8"");

And on the server side I do:
String message = request.getHeader(""Message""); 
byte [] msgBytes = message.getBytes(""UTF-8"");

Cipher rsa = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");
rsa.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, publicKey);
byte [] decryptedMsg = rsa.doFinal(msgBytes);

String decryptedString = new String(decryptedMsg, ""UTF-8"");

This doesn't work and I get BadPaddingException. 
I have tried using different instance of cipher, e.g. ""RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding"" or ""RSA/ECB/NoPadding"" but this didn't help. I also tried converting Strings using BASE64 but then I get a different exception: IllegalBlockSizeException.
I know I probably do sth wrong with converting Strings into byte arrays and vice versa, but I just can't figure out the correct way of doing that. Please help!
","You can't just convert arbitrary binary data (the encrypted text) into a String.  If you want to send the data as text, you need to use some sort of binary -> text encoding like Base64.

It currently stores information about the user that they upload their selves in their own sections of the Firebase database. It is stored in the structure that uses their uuid of their Firebase account and puts all their uploads under that i.e. their pictures, reminders, notes and passwords. 
I would like to encrypt the passwords section in the database so even I can not read it. When i say passwords section i mean the part in the app that allows users to store their own new generated passwords for other things ; not the password they use to login to the app, i know this is already encrypted and want to know how to achieve this myself. 
How would i go about it? Would i need to use the users auth/uuid that you can get from Firebase after they login as a private key to encrypt the password or any other data as they are uploading it? And store the public key somewhere in their section of the Firebase database? I am not very experienced when it comes to encryption.
If someone could please give me some sort of direction on how i should go about encrypting this data so even i cant read it from the back end that would be great thank you.

","Its android studio console character limitation that it shows long string in multiple lines. 

Best way is to copy that string in any text editor(notepad) and make it single line string and then paste it to studio.
Another way is just delete that '\n' character from your string it will be single line string.

e.g.
private static final String = ""abcdefgh"" +
    ""ijklmnop"" +
    ""qrstuvwxyz"";

just remove '\n' character from your string.

    RSA::PrivateKey privKey;
    privKey.Initialize(n, e, d);

It crashes. 

We need to see the actual code. I'm guessing two things. First (1), you are not using a try/catch, so the program terminates due to the uncaught exception. To fix this:
try
{
    // Some operation
}
catch (const Exception& ex)
{
    cerr << ex.what() << endl;
}

Second (2), you are using strings rather than Integers in the call to Iniaitialize. To fix this:
string n = ""b0f2bee693865282...8a0ba7db3e45ecf3h"";
string e = ""10001h"";
string d = ""246e365ca5e6f2de...9ec2172f7a5982edh"";

Integer _n(n.c_str()), _e(e.c_str()), _d(d.c_str());
RSA::PrivateKey privKey;
privKey.Initialize(_n, _e, _d);

The second issue should have been caught by the compiler. You should consider using -Wall to get a basic set of compiler diagnostics.

There's a potential third issue. That's the ""key fails to validate"" case. If you add a try/catch as described in (1), then you may see an ""Invalid key material"" or similar from CryptoMaterial class. In this case, your parameters do not validate according to the checks performed by Validate.
Validate is called by Initialize using a low-level of thoroughness (the level parameter below). The Validate function can be found in the manual at InvertibleRSAFunction::Validate. Following the link Definition at line 247 of file rsa.cpp:
  247 bool InvertibleRSAFunction::Validate(RandomNumberGenerator &rng, unsigned int level) const
  248 {
  249     bool pass = RSAFunction::Validate(rng, level);
  250     pass = pass && m_p > Integer::One() && m_p.IsOdd() && m_p < m_n;
  251     pass = pass && m_q > Integer::One() && m_q.IsOdd() && m_q < m_n;
  252     pass = pass && m_d > Integer::One() && m_d.IsOdd() && m_d < m_n;
  253     pass = pass && m_dp > Integer::One() && m_dp.IsOdd() && m_dp < m_p;
  254     pass = pass && m_dq > Integer::One() && m_dq.IsOdd() && m_dq < m_q;
  255     pass = pass && m_u.IsPositive() && m_u < m_p;
  256     if (level >= 1)
  257     {
  258         pass = pass && m_p * m_q == m_n;
  259         pass = pass && m_e*m_d % LCM(m_p-1, m_q-1) == 1;
  260         pass = pass && m_dp == m_d%(m_p-1) && m_dq == m_d%(m_q-1);
  261         pass = pass && m_u * m_q % m_p == 1;
  262     }
  263     if (level >= 2)
  264         pass = pass && VerifyPrime(rng, m_p, level-2) && VerifyPrime(rng, m_q, level-2);
  265     return pass;
  266 }

The remaining open question might be, where did m_p, m_q, etc come from? The answer is Initialize factors n based on e and d, and populates the CRT values like p, q, dp, dq, etc. It speeds up computation later.

This may be related.... e=10001h tells me Crypto++ probably did not generate the key pair. If Crypto++ generated the key pair, then it would use e=17 by default. How did you generate the key pair?

Above is an 2048-bit RSA key generated by OpenSSL. Notice it has a ""257"" length for the modulus field. If you count the hex chars printed for the modulus you see it is appropriately 512=256*2. In the ASN1, there is a 0x00 infront of the modulus. Since the modulus is an integer, this doesn't affect the RSA math. But why is it there? A 0x00 can also be seen in X509 certificates prefixing the public key value. What is the purpose of these extra 0x00?
","That's because of ASN.1 coding. As far as I remember, INTEGERs there are signed so when they starts from byte higher than 0x80 they should be treated as negative numbers, that's why they are prefixed with 0x00.

","Java really wants to see an encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo object, but you have a simpler PKCS#1 RSAPublicKey object.
The easiest way I know of is to use the PEMParser class from bouncycastle PKIX library -- there should be an equivalent library from Spongycastle. Use this class in lieu of the PemReader class you are currently using, as in:
        PEMParser pemParser = new PEMParser(new StringReader(publicKey));
        SubjectPublicKeyInfo spki = (SubjectPublicKeyInfo) pemParser.readObject();

","If you perform padding, cipher text should have fixed size equal to RSA public key modulus. If you get different size every time, then there is something with your program.
When you perform encryption data must be less than RSA_size(rsa) - 11 and encrypted must point to RSA_size(rsa) bytes of memory.
strlen(const char * str) computes length of null-terminated string. encrypt is not the string and is not null terminated, so using strlen is not valid here. Luckily for you PKCS#1 padding contains zero bytes, so you don't get segmentation fault.
On the other hand myData is a null terminated string. However, you use RSA_size(rsaPub) - 11 as its length, which will result in occasional segmentation faults.

No. cipherData is arbitrary binary data. It's not encoded text, which is what the various String constructors expect. (As an aside, you should almost never call the String.getBytes() or new String(byte[]) which don't specify an encoding. Always specify an appropriate encoding, which will depend on the situation.)
Either transmit the data as binary data instead of going through text at all, or use Base64 to safely encode the binary data as text first, then decode it from Base64 to binary again later before decrypting. There's a public domain Base64 encoder which is easy to use.

What is output of openssl_public_encrypt() and openssl_private_encrypt() functions?
Output of above functions (Encrypted data), will that be web-safe? 
How can I transfer generated encrypted data between websites?

","openssl_public_encrypt() encrypts a message with a public key so that only the corresponding private key can decrypt it.  This is used for protecting information against being seen by people who shouldn't.
openssl_private_encrypt() encrypts a message with a private key so that it can be decrypted by anyone who has the corresponding public key.  This is not used for protecting information against unwanted eyes, it's used for making digital signatures to help verify that the data hasn't been modified.  You generally shouldn't use this function; use openssl_sign() and openssl_verify() instead.
Encryption and signing are typically used together:  you take your data, sign it (using openssl_sign()) with your own private key, and then encrypt it (using openssl_public_encrypt()) with the recipient's public key.  Send both the signature and the encrypted message to the recipient, and the recipient can decrypt the message (using openssl_private_decrypt()) with his private key, and verify the signature (using openssl_verify()) with your public key.  This ensures that no one can read or tamper with the message while it's in transit, which is probably what you mean by ""web-safe"".
As for transferring data between websites, you can do that in any way you want.  HTTP, FTP, email, API calls, whatever.  The whole point of encryption and signing is that you don't have to use any special means to transfer the message securely.

I am hoping this is the right path .

You're way off track.
Instead of creating your own protocol, use SSL/HTTPS, the client can then send their username and password as usual through POST request (except it's done over HTTPS).
Alternatively, you can do ""mutual authentication"". This means that both the client and the server are authenticated using their public key (with HTTPS, only the server is authenticated with their certificate/public key).

","Don't invent new security protocols. Use HTTPS and then you don't need to encrypt the password yourself. With HTTP, any way you will encrypt and exchange keys will probably be not very effective, unless you do something basically the same as HTTPS does. It will only be Security through obscurity (google for that).
Edit:
And don't send passwords as GET parameters, but always as POST data, even with HTTPS. Even though GET parameters cannot be captured on the wire if https is used, they may be cached by browsers or go to server log unencrypted, for more info see here: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp

If I use CryptGenKey, I can call CryptExportPublicKeyInfo and CryptImportPublicKeyInfo to obtain the public key handle. However, when I try to do the same thing with private key decoded from PEM and imported using:
CryptImportKey(hCSP, pKeyBuf, cbKeyBuf, 0, CRYPT_EXPORTABLE, &hPrivKey)

import of the private key succeeds and I have a valid handle but the subsequent call to CryptExportPublicKeyInfo fails with ""Key does not exist"" error. It looks like there's another call missing between CryptImportKey and CryptExportPublicKeyInfo, but I can not find that API call.
","The problem with exporting/importing the public key was because private key was generated using AT_SIGNATURE, instead of AT_EXCHANGE. See the explanation and the example code

","An error 502 ""Bad Gateway"" indicates that the connection between the web server and something behind it got interrupted -- this happens for example when using nginx together with php-fpm, which is accessed throughout another network connection/socket. In the comments requesting further debug information you confirmed that guess, and also realized php is crashing because of a segmentation fault, which means some invalid memory location should have been accessed.
This can either happen because of a bug (which I wouldn't expect in this case, as an invalid key is not some completely surprising input nobody would test for) or because the compiled versions do not really fit together. You explained you build some parts on your own.
Debugging this is a hassle and often takes hours and hours, you'd need to attach a debugger and realize what's going wrong. If you have any chance, try to install everything from the package manager of your choice, do not use different sources like PECL and your packager manager to prevent problems. In Debian (and very likely also Ubuntu and other distributions, I didn't verify) some package like php5-gnupg should be available:
$ apt-cache show php5-gnupg
Package: php5-gnupg

"20205728","Hex encode ECDSA keys in node.js","I'm building a nodejs app that talks to an API server. The API server requires that each request I make to it includes a X-Signature header using the prime256v1 ECDSA curve and sha256 hash on a particular set of data. 
I looked through the crypto and tls documentation but didn't find anything suitable. I have successfully generated a private key with openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey but it is in PEM format. I have also generated a DER format key. Both of these include some extra metadata like the curve used and in the case of PEM, comments. 
I can use these keys for signing operations on my side, but the server requires that I upload a public key using hex encoding (so the server can verify the signatures I make on my requests.)
Specifically the server wants something like the output of the following Python code:
from ecdsa import SigningKey
from binascii import hexlify
hexlify(SigningKey.from_pem(content).to_string())

Sample output for a pubkey (no newlines): c5bd76cd0cd948de17a31261567d219576e992d9066fe1a6bca97496dec634e2c8e06f8949773b300b9f73fabbbc7710d5d6691e96bcf3c9145e15daf6fe07b9
I would prefer not adding python as a dependency to my node app... anyone know of a way I can extract the binary data representing my private key from the PEM or DER files, so I can put it in a buffer and call buffer.toString('hex')? Or a way I can use the native crypto library to generate the ECDSA keypair? Or a library that would do the same?
","openssl itself can print out the guts of things, in hex.
Doe the key change? sounds like you can just decode into hex one time, and use that?  No need for dependencies - just paste the hex into your node source?

What options do I have to implement end to end encryption over the text & data/files?
Note: I need to support one-to-one and group chats.
Any open source ready to use implementation specifically for socket.io? Googled it but no luck.
If not, then any hints to to implement something of my own?
","The end-to-end encryption used in WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger is powered by the Signal protocol (which have its own chat app), if you are using Socket.io with Javascript, you can easily use the javascript version of the Signal protocol. Just follow the readme to encrypt your data and use Socket.io to send it to the other hand, then decrypt the received data.
The end-to-end encryption used by Telegram is MTProto, developed by the Telegram team. Like Signal, it's open source so you can find the source code on Github.
Hope this will help!

"15461649","Windows 8 Metro RSA Encryption: AsymmetricKeyAlgorithmProvider ImportPublicKey Fails","I am attempting to pass some encrypted data between a Win 8 Metro app and a RESTful WCF service. Initially the Metro app requests a public key and the WCF service returns it as a raw Stream as to avoid any pesky formatting issues. The Base 64 encoded public key is decoded in the metro app into a byte array. Here is where the problem occurs. When I attempted to call AsymmetricKeyAlgorithmProvider.ImportPublicKey I get the error ""ASN1 bad tag value met"".
I am using RSA PKCS1 for the encryption. Here is the relevant code:
WCF Service
     string keyName = ""This is passed in via a parameter"";
     var key = !CngKey.Exists(keyName) ? CngKey.Create(CngAlgorithm2.Rsa, keyName) : CngKey.Open(keyName);

     // Create the RSA container to get keys and then dispose
     using (var rsaCng = new RSACng(key) { EncryptionPaddingMode = AsymmetricPaddingMode.Pkcs1, KeySize = 2048 })
     {
        byte[] publicBlob = rsaCng.Key.Export(CngKeyBlobFormat.GenericPublicBlob);
        publicKey = Convert.ToBase64String(publicBlob);
     }

Metro App
  public static string Encrypt(IBuffer dataBuffer, string publicKeyString)
  {
     var asymmAlg = AsymmetricKeyAlgorithmProvider.OpenAlgorithm(AsymmetricAlgorithmNames.RsaPkcs1);
     // The next line fails with ASN1 bad tag value met
     var publicKey = asymmAlg.ImportPublicKey(CryptographicBuffer.DecodeFromBase64String(publicKeyString), CryptographicPublicKeyBlobType.Pkcs1RsaPublicKey);

     var encryptedData = CryptographicEngine.Encrypt(publicKey, dataBuffer, null);
     return CryptographicBuffer.EncodeToBase64String(encryptedData);
  }

EDIT 1: More information below
Exporting the public key from a 2048bit key pair from the WCF service yields a 283 bit length key blob, while exporting the same type of public key from the Metro app is only 270 bits. When I import the Metro generated public key it succeeds. Any idea why the WCF service has 13 extra bits on its public key? I think those extra 13 bits are causing the failure.
Here is the Metro code that yields the shorter public key blob:
var provider = AsymmetricKeyAlgorithmProvider.OpenAlgorithm(AsymmetricAlgorithmNames.RsaPkcs1);
CryptographicKey standardKeyPair = provider.CreateKeyPair(2048);
byte[] standardKey = standardKeyPair.ExportPublicKey(CryptographicPublicKeyBlobType.Pkcs1RsaPublicKey).ToArray();

","Quite late, but maybe it will help you or saves someone's time...
Change the type of blob type during import. It's really wierd, but I had success with it, after experimenting.
Your code in WCF may stay as it is.
Change just the Metro code:
public static string Encrypt(IBuffer dataBuffer, string publicKeyString)
{
    var asymmAlg = AsymmetricKeyAlgorithmProvider.OpenAlgorithm(AsymmetricAlgorithmNames.RsaPkcs1);
    // The next line fails with ASN1 bad tag value met
    var publicKey = asymmAlg.ImportPublicKey(CryptographicBuffer.DecodeFromBase64String(publicKeyString), CryptographicPublicKeyBlobType.BCryptPublicKey);

    var encryptedData = CryptographicEngine.Encrypt(publicKey, dataBuffer, null);
    return CryptographicBuffer.EncodeToBase64String(encryptedData);
}

So the only change here is the BCryptPublicKey during the importing. Then it works. But do not ask me why :-).

but I had problem using git submodule update after I git clone from the source, so I manually download and paste the contiki file into the contiki folder.

You cannot then just download any contiki file, since the idea of a submodule is to reference an exact SHA1 of another repo.
Try again to clone the main repo, this time with --recursive (and make sure to use the latest Git 2.11.1)
cd /path/to/ly/local/clone/of/ecc-light-certificate 
cd ..
move ecc-light-certificate ecc-light-certificate.old
git clone --recursive https://github.com/nist-emntg/ecc-light-certificate

The error is:
no such remote ref 7a493c44edb6952bf82fc808b9dd91c30d49c871 
Fetched in submodule path 'contiki', but it did not contain 7a493c44edb6952bf82fc808b9dd91c30d49c871.  
Direct fetching of that commit failed

First: https://github.com/tcheneau/contiki@7a493c44edb6952bf82fc808b9dd91c30d49c871 does exist.
However, looking at its commit page 7a493c4, you can see it does not belong to any branch or tag: it is a commit still kept in the GitHub remote repo, but not fetch by default (because, again, no branch or tag includes it)
You need to open an issue on nist-emntg/ecc-light-certificate/issues project to alert them on that non-existing commit reference for the submodule contiki. 
If you look for that commit message, you will find commit 1396dfd from the native fix-native-build branch:

I've tried to follow examples, and I've read through APIs to try and figure out what is wrong, but so far I haven't been able to come up with an answer to why the decryption fails with such a basic test...
I have printed out the hexes of all the stuff I transfer between the client and the server, and they seem to be identical. I've tried to use different paddings, and ciphers, but none seem to work.
The codes from the two programs (I've edited out the non-essential printouts):
Server code:
RSAKeyPairGenerator kpg = new RSAKeyPairGenerator();
kpg.initialize(1024);
KeyPair kp = kpg.generateKeyPair();
PublicKey pk = kp.getPublic();
PrivateKey pri = kp.getPrivate();
InputStream in = csocket.getInputStream();
OutputStream out = csocket.getOutputStream();
DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(in);
DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(out);

// write getEncoded().length
dos.writeInt(pk.getEncoded().length);

// write key
byte[] public_key = pk.getEncoded();
for (int x=0;x<public_key.length;x++) {
    dos.writeByte(public_key[x]);
}
dos.flush();

// read enc length
int len=dis.readInt();
byte[] data = new byte[len];

// read enc stuff
System.out.println(""Read data:"");
for (int x=0;x<len;x++) {
    data[x]=dis.readByte();

byte [] decrypted = null;

    cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, pri);

"6382656","Encrypting a file with RSA in Python without storing any password","I have asked a similar question in post Encrypting a file with RSA in Python , but this question has a different connotation.
I am encrypting a file with AES, using RSA to encrypt the AES password.
The only difference is that i really DON'T want to store the AES password. The user must give both the path to his RSA key, and the password.
So what do you think about this scheme?

path_to_RSA_key = ... # Given by the user
pwd = ... # This will be used to encrypt the file. Also given by user.

rsa_enc = RSA.importKey(path_to_RSA_key)
# Encrypt the Password with RSA, keep the last 32 characters
rsa_pwd = rsa_enc.encrypt(pwd)[-32:]
# Aes, with the encrypted password
aes_enc = AES.new(rsa_pwd, AES.MODE_CBC)

# Encrypt the file with AES...
# Store only the encrypted file
# Don't store the password in any way, don't store the path to RSA key

The alternative would be the classic scheme, when you generate a random password, encrypt the file with AES using the random pass, encrypt the random pwd with RSA and store only the encrypted results.
If you really need to know why i need this, it's a project of mine, http://code.google.com/p/scrambled-egg
What do you think about the scheme ? Thank you in advance !
","There seems to be some confusion.  You mention that you don't want to store the 'password', but you're working with RSA and not a symmetric algorithm.  The term 'password' strongly implies a shared secret as used in symmetric encryption, and it appears that you're trying really hard to fit RSA into the mould you've created.
The issue I see is that this functionality may not fit into your planned use very well.  Your plan seems focused on symmetric ciphers.  Further, using asymmetric keys this way may be a problem.  I think asymmetric encryption is used to encrypt nonces for a reason; it may not be robust to attacks that can be waged against a scheme like the one you propose.
Asymmetric keys are often used as follows:

Generate a purely random 32-'character' key and call it ""nonce"".
Encrypt the message with the ""nonce"" and call it ciphertext.
Encrypt the ""nonce"" with your asymmetric key (presumably the public key, but you should specify).
The result consists of the ciphertext and the asymmetrically encrypted ""nonce"".

Decrypting requires only the paired opposite of the asymmetric key used to encrypt.
If you're hardcore, you could encrypt (using AES + a password or similar) the public or private key that can be used to decrypt the nonce and send it along for a ride too.  Sadly that isn't really increasing security over AES+password, and you are increasing the bloat in your message by a lot.

"28746209","RSA Encryption in JavaCard","I hope anyone can help me with my problem. 
I'm developing a javacard applet and my task is to encrypt a secret (stored in the applet) with the public key of a server. The returning cipher will be send to a server afterwrds - php script on the server - where the cipher should be decrypted with the servers private key again.
And The problem is that the decryption in the php script (openssl_private_decrypt(...)) doesn't return anything, so it fails anywhere.
PS: I also saw some javacard RSA encryption examples and nearly all of them are using a private key for encryption which means in my opinion that the data is only be signed, not encrypted, am I right?
Here is some example code from the javacard applet:
byte[] secret ={ (byte)0x01,(byte)0x02,(byte)0x03,(byte)0x04}
public Crypto() {
    RSAPublicKey rsaPublicKey = (RSAPublicKey) KeyBuilder.buildKey(
    KeyBuilder.TYPE_RSA_PUBLIC, KeyBuilder.LENGTH_RSA_2048, false);
    Cipher rsaCipher = Cipher.getInstance(Cipher.ALG_RSA_PKCS1, false);
    encryptSecretWithPubKey();
}
.....
// here are some methods for setting the public key
.....

public byte[] encryptSecretWithPubKey() {
    if (!isRSAKeyInitialized) {
        ISOException.throwIt(ISO7816.SW_CONDITIONS_NOT_SATISFIED);
    }
    // make sure the blocks size which should be encrypted is not longer
    // than 53 bytes; see ALG_RSA_PKCS1 definition for encryption.
    if (secret.length >= rsaKeyModulus.length - 11) {
       // normally not the case, so ignore it for this test
    }
    rsaCipher.init(rsaPublicKey, Cipher.MODE_ENCRYPT);
    final byte[] encryptedMsg = JCSystem.makeTransientByteArray(
            (short) 256, JCSystem.CLEAR_ON_DESELECT);

    if (rsaPublicKey.isInitialized())
        rsaCipher.doFinal(secret, (short) 0,
                (short) secret.length, encryptedMsg, (short) 0);
    return encryptedMsg; 
}

And here are the function I use for decryption in the php script:
public function decrypt($data)
{ // data is in binary format
    if (openssl_private_decrypt($data, $decrypted, $this->privkey))
        $data = $decrypted;
    else
        // openssl function fails here, so no plain data is returned
        $data = '';
    return $data;
}

I hope you can help what I'm ding wrong here, or might it be a bug in the Cipher class what I'm not expecting :)
EDIT: 
The openssl decryption on the server throws following error message:
error:0407106B:rsa routines:RSA_padding_check_PKCS1_type_2:block type is not 02
The error means, that the block type is wrong. Im using the public key in the applet so the block Type should be 02 but it isnt... 
EDIT:
The problem is solved now. It was a programming error of my own. The modulus was not set correctly (the last byte was always set to zero) so the decryption doesn't work afterwards.

"9299077","Trouble decrypting using PostgreSQL's gnupg extension","I'm getting an error when I try to decrypt using PostgreSQL's gnupg extension and the gpg_pub_decrypt function.
Here's the query I'm executing, which should do a round-trip encryption/decryption of the string Hello world!:
select pgp_pub_decrypt(
           pgp_pub_encrypt('Hello world!', dearmor(:public_key)),
           dearmor(:private_key),
           ''
           );

Instead, I get the error:
'SQLSTATE[39000]: External routine invocation exception: 7 ERROR:  Corrupt data'

I execute the query and provide the public and private key values through this php script.
<?php

function roundTrip() {

  $pubkey = file_get_contents(""public_key"");
  $privkey = file_get_contents(""secret_key"");

  $conn = new PDO(""pgsql:dbname=*********"", ""*********"", ""*********"");
  $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
  $sql = ""select pgp_pub_decrypt( pgp_pub_encrypt('Hello world!', dearmor(:public_key)), dearmor(:private_key), '')"";
  $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);
  $stmt->bindParam(':public_key', $pubkey);
  $stmt->bindParam(':private_key', $privkey);
  $stmt->execute();             // <------------------ Error encountered here
  $row = $stmt->fetch();
  file_put_contents('test.out', $row[0]);
}

roundTrip();

?>

I generated the key pair with gnupg and it is not password protected, so the last argument to pgp_pub_decrypt is the empty string.
I've exported both private and public keys to ASCII files for the script to read.  They are included below for anyone who wants to verify their validity.
I can make a successful round trip using gpg on the command line using the unexported keys, so I know they work.  I'd use the exported ones if gpg provided a way to do so, but I don't think it does.
Can anybody tell me what's going wrong?

I checked the reponse from the card. i am getting all the 64 bytes of the modulus correctly. but when i make the Big Integer i am getting a large negative value. what should i do?
","The issue is that BigInteger by default encodes to a signed big endian representation. If you decode the bytes using the constructor it does the opposite, i.e. it expects a signed value. Now most cryptography is performed on (large) unsigned integers. This is because the calculations are performed within a mathematical group (modulus calculations). These calculations are always performed on positive numbers, and RSA is no exception to this rule.
Now the size of the modulus is equal to the key size (not the key strength) of the RSA key. This means that an RSA key of 512 bit has a modulus of exactly 512 bits when encoded as a unsiged, big endian number. For numbers this means that the most significant bit is always set to '1'. However, that bit is used to indicate the sign bit for unsigned numbers encoded as a two-complement value. In other words, any modulus that has a key size dividable by 8 will be negative when interpreted as signed value.
The solution is of course to use the constructor where you can indicate the sign bit yourself:
BigInteger(int signum, byte[] magnitude)

where magnitude is the unsigned representation, in your case:
new BigInteger(1, resp.getData());

Java Card uses unsigned representations in the API, as it is more cryptographically oriented. No need for complicated methods in there.

Note that the reverse - creating a statically sized byte array out of an encoded signed BigInteger is even trickier, see this answer for information about how to perform that particular conversion.

"31456541","How to verify GPG signature with OpenSSL","I wrote a simple cross-platform utility to verify GPG signatures using the gpgme. However gpgme doesn't work very well on windows and on other platforms (e.g. osx) it requires GnuPG command line utilities installed which is a pretty heavy dependency. I looked into other openpgp libraries as well such as netgpg but these are even less portable (it really has to build with mingw-w64).
Would it be possible to implement a standalone tool to verify GPG signature using only standard libraries like openssl and zlib? From what I understand openpgp consists of standard ciphers and hash functions. What is the part that makes this so difficult that there are no good C libraries out there to do this?
","OpenSSL does not implement the OpenPGP format and is not compatible. Use an OpenPGP implementation like GnuPG, Bouncycastle (framework available for Java/C#) or others (OpenPGP.js for JavaScript, and there's a Go library).
While OpenPGP uses standard cryptographic digest and encryption algorithms, it has a different message format and especially uses its own CFB mode variant. You'd have to implement both a parser for the OpenPGP message format and get compatible with the OpenPGP CFB mode (if you want to support encryption), and finally pass the results to OpenSSL for the actual cryptography.
Finally, supporting the whole web of trust concept including the full OpenPGP specification is a broad task and has a variety of issues to consider ([1], [2], ...). In the unix world, people seem to be happy enough with GnuPG and GPGME, which are deeply tested and analyzed for even very advanced security issues (for example, this side channel attack). New implementations are most likely vulnerable to similar problems already solved for GnuPG.

I have a web service that I need to access. The web service is set up as HTTPS. The traffic between client and server is encrypted (this doesn't have to do with authentication).
I'm interacting with the web service via cURL and PHP. I've gotten an example to work locally over HTTP and I'm fairly confident I'm on the right track with regards to cURL/PHP side of things. 
When using the HTTP version of the code to access a web service over HTTPS, I am getting an error code 60 ""SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK"" (error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed)

CURLOPT_CAINFO
CURLOPT_SSLCERT
CURLOPT_SSLKEYPASSWD

My question is how do I know where to get the PEM file or whether I can simply make it? This is probably going to be an obvious answer as I'm sure I'm missing something but I figure I just need to ask and get the background I'm missing.
Amendment: The web service is using a certificate signed by VeriSign. So it's not a self signed certificate. Also, the web service is owned and operated by an external organization. 
Thanks. 
","Despite googling around prior to asking this, it seems I've stumbled upon the answer after a bit of back-n-fourth with 'thatidiotguy' (his user name, not my name for him. ;-) ). 
cURL, out of the box, does not trust any CA (VeriSign or otherwise). This needs to be setup on your server. To ""solve"" the problem, you have two options. You can bypass the verification with the following command:
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);

Note that this is not optimal with regards to security. Any certificate, signed by a CA or not, will be accepted as trusted. 
The proper fix involves getting the original certificate (in my case this means the web service) and ""exporting"" the certificate as a X.509 Certificate (PEM). The certificate then needs to appropriately moved to the server and the following configurations set: 
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 2); //Check that the common name exists and that it matches the host name of the server
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CAINFO, getcwd() . ""/path/to/cert/my-exported.crt""); //PEM file

","SSH works roughly like the following.  Note that this is merely a high level explanation:
Each party has two keys:  a public key and a private key.  The public/private keys are related  mathematically, such that they are functionally inverse.  Thus an operation performed by one can only be undone exactly by the other.  It is complex, but think of it like calculating x^nnn versus the nnnth root of x.  The former is easy but the latter is difficult, making it computationally unfeasible to guess with enough accuracy to undo the operation.  This gives us some desirable attributes that allow  SSH to do the following with them:
The client connects to the server.  The server proves its identity by presenting a certificate signed with its private key.  The client uses the server's public key to decrypt the certificate and knows that only the client could have encrypted it since it requires the private key.  The server then does the same with a certificate presented by the client.  Identification can only be performed with 100% assurance using a trusted third party to manage the public keys.  Without the third party only identity changes can be detected.
Now that identities are verified, the server generates a symmetric secret key, encrypts it with the client's public key, and send it to the client (who is the only one that can decrypt the message since it requires the private key).  From this point on, both the client and server have the symmetric secret key, and all communication is encrypted with this key.  This is done for performance reasons because symmetric encryption operations are roughly 100 times faster than asymmetric operations.
This is how SSL verifies identities, and encrypts the information.  Note that more granular access control are provided by higher level applications (such as *nix file permissions), not SSL.

I've copied this to a text file in my main/assets folder. I read this in like so:
InputStream input = context.getAssets().open(filename);

This is then read in to a byte array through a fairly standard ByteArrayOutputStream method.
I then try and convert that to a public key as such:
public static PublicKey getPublicKey(byte[] keyBytes){
    PublicKey publicKey = null;

    if(keyBytes != null) {

        X509EncodedKeySpec spec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(keyBytes);
        KeyFactory kf = null;
        try {
            kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
            publicKey = kf.generatePublic(spec);
        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
            Log.e(TAG, ""NoSuchAlgorithmException"");
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (InvalidKeySpecException e) {
            Log.e(TAG, ""InvalidKeySpecException "" + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    return publicKey;
}

Problem is I keep getting this error:
InvalidKeySpecException java.lang.RuntimeException: error:0D0680A8:asn1 encoding routines:ASN1_CHECK_TLEN:wrong tag

I've been attacking this for hours, and can't seem to get around it. Please please any suggestions welcome.
I've tried Base64 as such:
byte[] tempNewKey = Base64.decode(keyBytes, Base64.DEFAULT);

Which makes no difference and I've also tried using
RSAPublicKeySpec pubKeySpec = new RSAPublicKeySpec(new BigInteger(module), new BigInteger(exponent));

However putty doesn't tell me anything about an exponent? If I go ahead with this method I don't get the same error, but if I try and decrypt with my private key I just get gibberish.
Really hope you can help. Many Thanks
","SSH keys are not X509 compatible keys. They are stored in a SSH proprietary format. You'll need a SSH capable libary to retrieve the key value.
If SSH functionality is not required then it is possible to generate keys in Java (using the keytool command line or KeyPairGenerator.
Alternatively it is also possible to use external applications or libraries such as the openssl command line. In the case of OpenSSL specify DER as output. Java expects a DER encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure for X509EncodedKeySpec.

","Your requirements are reasonable, but your proposed solution is fundamentally flawed and should be abandoned.
You should go back to your requirements and seek to achieve those requirements using the standard techniques and APIs.
You should not try to invent your own cryptography methodology. It is difficult to get right and you are much more likely to create a truly secure system if you follow the standard practices. Some thoughts on how you should approach your requirements:

You need to establish some way to managed/distribute certificates in such a way that you can establish trust between the entities that are communicating. Usually, certificates (which are basically signed public keys that have been signed by someone that you trust) are used and distributed freely.
To allow verification of the identity of the sender (and also that the message has not been modified), you will use a digital signature (not encryption). What happens here is that a ""digest"" or ""hash"" is computed over the contents of the message, resulting in a relatively small number of bytes regardless of the length of the message. The digest is signed with the sender's private key. The sender's public key can be used to validate the signature.
To allow the message to be read only by the intended recipients, you will use encryption. What happens here is that a random, single-use passphrase is generated and used to encrypt the message. The passphrase is encrypted using the intended recipient's public key. The recipient's private key is required in order to recover the passphrase, which then allows the message to be decrypted. You can encrypt the same copy of the message for multiple recipients simply by encrypting the passphrase multiple times.
You need to pick a message format, which allows for parsing the signed, encrypted message to pick out the various parts. An example would be CMS (cryptographic message format).

As you have found out, RSA is good for encrypting relatively small amounts of data. I will also note that encrypting with RSA is much much slower than encrypting with a symmetric algorithm such as AES. The encryption community has worked for decades to come up with secure and performant solutions, such as a way to leverage the performance of symmetric encryption (e.g., AES) while having the trust pattern (no shared secret) of asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA).

","Like some other crypto systems, Paillier key generation starts out by picking two large primes p,q and setting n=p*q. Since messages have to be in Z/nZ (this denotes integeres modulo n), it is indeed correct that if you choose a 1024-bit implementation (i.e., n has 1024 bits), you can't encode messages larger than 1024 bits in a single step.
However, nothing prevents you from splitting your larger message into many smaller blocks and encrypting every block individually. In your case, the state of the first 32 radios would forn the first block, which you then encrypt and send. Repeat for the state of radios 33-64, etc etc etc.

","I know the question is old, but I think my observations are valid.
First of all: never use an asymmetric cipher as a block cipher. This has security and performance implications. If you need to encrypt large chunks of data, use a symmetric cipher (AES for example), it will perform much better and it is secure (if used properly) to be used as a block cipher. If you need, use the asymmetric cipher to exchange the symmetric key.
Now about Paillier. The amount of data you can encrypt with Paillier is limited to ""n"", non-inclusive. ""n"" is generated by picking two large primes ""p"" and ""q"", such that n = p*q. Then you must have the message m < n. That is, the message ""m"" should be smaller than ""n"". Suppose you have a text like: radio. You can represent it in binary as: 01110010 01100001 01100100 01101001 01101111 00001010. If read 01110010 01100001 01100100 01101001 01101111 00001010 as a number, you get: m = 125762622025482. If you have m < n, then you can encrypt ""m"".
Now about this claim: 

I am told from colleagues that have more practical experience with
  Paillier that we cannot pack more than 1024 bits into a Paillier
  ciphertext.

It is WRONG. Paillier, like other asymmectric ciphers, will, in almost all cases, expand the size of the plaintext. That is, the size, in bits, of the ciphertext will be bigger than the size in bits of the plain text. What determines the maximum size of the plaintext and the cipher text is n, which is limited by the primes p and q. So, as long as you pick large enough primes, you can pack more than 1024 bits in a ciphertext. But bear in mind: as you increase the primes size, you will degrade performance. So you should find a good balance between performance and security when choosing the primes size. n with 3072 a good choice for Paillier.
To sum up: Don't use Paillier or any other asymmetric cipher as block a cipher. Use them to exchange symmetric keys, then use a symmetric cipher, with a good mode of operation (like CTR. Don't use ECB).

","pyCrypto uses SHA1 for both hashing and MGF1 by default. If you pass in SHA-256 for hashing, it will also use that for MGF1 (code reference). So you need to specifically set hashing to SHA-256 and MGF1 to SHA-1:

","RSA encryption is described as
c = m^e mod N,

where c is a cipher text, m is an original message, e is public exponent (typically 65537) and N is public modulus.
Thus, c is always smaller than N, but in most of the cases of the same order as it. Sure you can select N and m to get a small c, but this will obviously lead to make encryption weaker, and you need a special key for every message.
Probably, the same problem will be with other assymetric cryptosystems. Shorter cipher text is easier to recover. But you can use AES, which can produce in counter mode a cipher text of the same size as an original message. Which reveals size of the message to the attacker.

","I don't know what's causing your problem (we'd have to see where you use this class to debug that), but I do have an alternative for you, if you can include a 3rd party library. See JSch, which can generate RSA keypairs (e.g. for use in SSH public-key authentication). Documentation: http://epaul.github.com/jsch-documentation/simple.javadoc/

  <activity

Because this class is not extends As Activity ,you required this class for GenerateKeyPair so no need to declare this class in Manifest file.And what about this class Installation ,is this class is also not extends as Activity then remove it also.After that you will get run successfully.

"54238568","Reading a PKCS#1 or SPKI public key in Java without libraries","I need to use a public key to verify some data in Java, but I can't seem to format the key in such a way that Java can use without third-party plugins.
I'm generating the key with Node.js's crypto library, which gives me the option of PKCS#1 or SPKI, and either .pem or .der file format.
I've heard that Java doesn't support PKCS#1 out-of-the box, and pretty much every other answer on StackOverflow recommends using BouncyCastle or similar, but in my case, I am writing an SDK, and simply cannot afford to use a library just to read this public key.
So I'm currently reading the key in .der format as it saves having to strip the PEM headers and decode the key from base-64. When I run this, I get the error:
java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException: java.lang.RuntimeException: error:0c0000be:ASN.1 encoding routines:OPENSSL_internal:WRONG_TAG

Here's what I have (sorry, it's in Kotlin, not Java like the title suggests)
// Here's a key for convenience
val key = Base64.getDecoder().decode(""MFUCTgF/uLsPBS13Gy7C3dPpiDF6SYCLUyyl6CFqPtZT1h5bwKR9EDFLQjG/kMiwkRMcmEeaLKe5qdj9W/FfFitwRAm/8F53pQw2UETKQI2b2wIDAQAB"");

val keySpec = X509EncodedKeySpec(key)
val keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"")
val publicKey = keyFactory.generatePublic(keySpec) // error thrown here

val cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/NONE/PKCS1Padding"")
cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, publicKey)

My best idea at the minute is to install a library on the Node.js side, which is less problematic, to support exporting the key as PKCS#8, but I thought I'd check first to see if I'm missing anything.
","The following code turns a PKCS#1 encoded public key into a SubjectPublicKeyInfo encoded public key, which is the public key encoding accepted by the RSA KeyFactory using X509EncodedKeySpec - as SubjectPublicKeyInfo is defined in the X.509 specifications.
Basically it is a low level DER encoding scheme which

wraps the PKCS#1 encoded key into a bit string (tag 0x03, and a encoding for the number of unused bits, a byte valued 0x00);
adds the RSA algorithm identifier sequence (the RSA OID + a null parameter) in front - pre-encoded as byte array constant;
and finally puts both of those into a sequence (tag 0x30).

No libraries are used. Actually, for createSubjectPublicKeyInfoEncoding, no import statements are even required.

Notes:

NoSuchAlgorithmException should probably be caught and put into a RuntimeException;
the private method createDERLengthEncoding should probably not accept negative sizes.
Larger keys have not been tested, please validate createDERLengthEncoding for those - I presume it works, but better be safe than sorry.

","If you do not want to declare a static key or derive a key from the static password, you can certainly derive a random key and store that value in the Keychain. SecRandomCopyBytes will return an array of arbitrary length that was generated in a  cryptographically secure manner. You can request 32 bytes (256 bits) from this service and store that as your key in the keychain.

            byte[] cipherText = cipher.doFinal(ccNum.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));

            // Get the encrypted value as a Base64-encoded String
            String encodeToStr = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(cipherText);

            // Print out the encoded, encrypted string
            System.out.println(""Encrypted and Encoded String: "" + encodeToStr);

I compared the byte array values at every step. The desktop cipher and android cipher got exactly the same inputs. However the results from the Android code cipher.doFinal can not be decrypted by the backend. If I put the desktop results to the REST call body they work fine, so it is not something caused by REST call.
I also tried to create a public/private key pair on Android, and use the generated public key to encrypt instead of using the public key from our backend, and decrypt using the private key and it works. So the cipher is also working, just somehow the backend is expecting something different
","Finally someone in the team cracked this. 
The reason is because the Android OS uses Bouncy castle, the backend uses Sun as the provider, this caused the backend throwing a BadPaddingException.
To make it work, the cipher needs to be initialized this way on Android:
 mCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, new
                    OAEPParameterSpec(""SHA-256"", ""MGF1"", MGF1ParameterSpec.SHA1,
                    PSource.PSpecified.DEFAULT));

","Convert Certificate to Modulus, Exponent
The process for taking a certificate or a public key and turning it into integers is a surprisingly tough task as first glance. There's a long chain of decoding and encoding to various format that this page will describe.
1. Certificate to Public Key

These keys will be used by applications that are running on EC2s and Lambdas. The applications will need to be set up with policies that will allow the application or lambda to pull the keys out of the key store.  The key store should also manage the key expiry, notifying various people when keys are going to expire. The initial key exchange is between my company and its partners meaning that we may have either a public or private key for a key pair depending upon the data transfer direction.
We have looked at KMS but from what I have seen KMS does not support asymmetric keys.  I have also seen online that some people are using either S3 (protected by KMS) or parameter store to store the keys but this does not address the issue of key management.
Do you guys have any thoughts on this? or even SaaS/PaaS suggestions?
","My recommendation would be to use AWS Secrets Manager for this. Secrets Manager allows you to store any type of credential/key, you can set up fine-grained cross account permissions to secrets, encryption at rest is used (via KMS), and secrets can be automatically rotated (by providing an expiration time and an AWS Lambda function owned by you to perform the rotation).

I have my key in encryption.der file. Everything works fine in android. Now coming to IOS which I'm using Ionic to develop. I'm not able to achieve the encryption part. I have used the ""cryptico"" : link : https://github.com/wwwtyro/cryptico/blob/master/README.md . 
And finally converting to Base64 like these.
var EncryptionPassword = cryptico.encrypt($scope.userInfo.Password, publicKey);
$scope.encPass = base64.encode(EncryptionPassword.cipher);

But I'm getting ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exception from BL. Can you suggest exact same solution has android for angularjs too. So RSA encrytion works on both IOS and Android.

Create a Service and place your public Key inside that. 
.service('Settings', function(){
this.publicKey = 'MIIBIjANBgdcssvsvsfvsfvsfvrefvfvfviuwoihijwfoiw278499080989i09M+KC8MYYOu/NRLmFg85LRrfRszyI/vZ/k8982789uiwbgchdbhU+3joQZoJ3Sxq/GbIIFf/3y4f9DuKI53y1qR2qD4xIskfa9rPVqvBtAu2KSNRd8V4J8RKI2gT2YEA+A3Z0mQq4GBRS8iYmGLqRQyPfNUSankylBrTpOIVFBZORdZehjJMmwl98UynyfnyMIHUIFuhefuibiufbeufbsoijn93fD7nxt+siZryfazn3EAgBaTKTV/U5xIepzDN6ZYJ4qnC93u6erdb1X4m1zU6RGapwzCOPOORTyzw/uWJ8twcODNt0cqVp+sYQIDAQAB';

Now in your JS encrypt using public key and JSEncrypt.

var encrypt = new JSEncrypt();                                                  encrypt.setPublicKey(Settings.publicKey);
EncryptionPin = encrypt.encrypt($scope.customerInfo.Pin);

EncryptionPin is the final key.

Can someone help me and tell me what I'm doing wrong?
Thank you for every help.
[EDIT]
This code works, I had problem in method loading multiple keys.
","Well, I had the same problem a year later. I wish that you've solved yours. I'm writing my solution here just in case that someone else has similar issues.
Your encryption code doesn't have problem. The problem might be in the decryption. For an encrypted data object, the correct key should be found by using the key id stored with the object. My decryption process reads like the following:
private byte[] decryptWithKey(byte[] bytes, PGPSecretKey secKey, String pass)
        throws PGPException, IOException {
    PBESecretKeyDecryptor keyDec = new JcePBESecretKeyDecryptorBuilder(
            new JcaPGPDigestCalculatorProviderBuilder().setProvider(""BC"").build())
            .setProvider(""BC"").build(pass.toCharArray());
    ByteArrayOutputStream bout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

    PGPPrivateKey privateKey = secKey.extractPrivateKey(keyDec);
    PublicKeyDataDecryptorFactory dec1 =
            new JcePublicKeyDataDecryptorFactoryBuilder().setProvider(""BC"").build(privateKey);
    JcaPGPObjectFactory objFact = new JcaPGPObjectFactory(bytes);
    PGPEncryptedDataList encList = (PGPEncryptedDataList) objFact.nextObject();

    PGPPublicKeyEncryptedData encD = null;
    for(Iterator<PGPPublicKeyEncryptedData> it = encList.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {
        PGPPublicKeyEncryptedData end = it.next();
        if (secKey.getKeyID() == end.getKeyID()) {
            encD = end;
            break;
        }
    }
    assert encD != null: ""Cannot find encrypted data with key: ""
            + Long.toHexString(secKey.getKeyID());
    InputStream in = encD.getDataStream(dec1);
    byte[] buf = new byte[BufferSize];
    for (int len; (len = in.read(buf)) >= 0; ) {
        bout.write(buf, 0, len);
    }
    bout.close();
    return bout.toByteArray();
}

The key is the for loop that finds the matching key for the encrypted object.

","The cert and key variables require to be byte array so read it as byte array by the following

","The problem I am having is you don't appear to know what you have, and the some of the parameters you are using are wrong when taken with the other parameters. So its pretty much a stab in the dark.

First, you should wrap the disk operations in a try/catch. I/O can always cause problems, so be sure to catch exceptions related to the iostream stuff. You should also catch the Crypto++ Exception related to key loading. That will handle the ""crash"" with no information.
So your code might look something like:
try
{
    // Read key from disk, load it into Crypto++ object
}
catch(const Exception& ex)
{
    cerr << ""Caught Crypto++ exception "" << ex.what() << endl;
}
catch(const std::runtime_error& ex)
{
    cerr << ""Caught C++ runtime error "" << ex.what() << endl;
}


Second, this looks like a private exponent, and not a private key:
std::string  privatekeyString=""02C200102C180F9E6A4E7A2F58B5BE86BC179478"";

And its too big to be in P-128. Maybe you should do something like:
try
{
    AutoSeededRandomPool prng;

    std::string exponent=""02C200102C180F9E6A4E7A2F58B5BE86BC179478"";
    StringSource ss(exponent, true /*pumpAll*/, new HexDecoder);

    Integer x;
    x.Decode(ss, ss.MaxRetrievable(), Integer::UNSIGNED);        
    // cout << ""Exponent: "" << std::hex << x << endl;

    ECIES<ECP>::Decryptor decryptor;
    decryptor.AccessKey().Initialize(ASN1::secp256r1(), x);

    bool valid = decryptor.AccessKey().Validate(prng, 3);
    if(!valid)
        throw  Exception(Exception::OTHER_ERROR, ""Exponent is not valid for P-256"");

    // Or: decryptor.AccessKey().ThrowIfInvalid(prng, 3);

    cout << ""Exponent is valid for P-256"" << endl;        
}
catch(const Exception& ex)
{
    cerr << ex.what() << endl;
}


Or, you can:
ECIES<ECP>::Decryptor decryptor;
decryptor.AccessKey().AccessGroupParameters().Initialize(ASN1::secp256r1());
decryptor.AccessKey().SetPrivateExponent(x);


If you add the following to the program above:
// Encode key, use OID versus domain paramters
string encoded;
HexEncoder encoder(new StringSink(encoded));

decryptor.AccessKey().AccessGroupParameters().SetEncodeAsOID(true);
decryptor.GetKey().Save(encoder);

cout << ""Private key: "" << encoded << endl;

You will get the following for the private key:
$ ./ecies-test.exe
Exponent: 2c200102c180f9e6a4e7a2f58b5be86bc179478h
Private key: 3041020100301306072A8648CE3D020106082A8648CE3D030107042730250201010
42000000000000000000000000002C200102C180F9E6A4E7A2F58B5BE86BC179478

As you can see, the key is not ""02C200102C180F9E6A4E7A2F58B5BE86BC179478"".
The 12 leading 0's look suspicious to me. Though the exponent validates, you should verify the exponent and the field. The closest fit I could find is the curve secp160r2 (of course, curves like secp192k1 and secp224k1 work too).
The private key above is the hex encoding of ecies.priv.der shown below.

Third, this could be a public point in compressed form due to the leading 02.
std::string  privatekeyString=""02C200102C180F9E6A4E7A2F58B5BE86BC179478"";

If that is the case, then you are supposed to be able to do this, but I can't get it to decode the point (see Minimizing Key Size for Persistence on the wiki). x and y are 0 after the operation; maybe the problem is with the field:

Fourth, you should probably save the entire key, and not just the exponent. Here's a program for you that shows you how to save and load the keys. It also shows you how to perform encryption and decryption in one-liners.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Part one - generate keys

ECIES<ECP>::Decryptor decryptor(prng, ASN1::secp256r1());
ECIES<ECP>::Encryptor encryptor(decryptor);

/////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Part two - save keys

FileSink fs1(""ecies.priv.der"", true /*binary*/);
decryptor.AccessKey().AccessGroupParameters().SetEncodeAsOID(true);
decryptor.GetKey().Save(fs1);

FileSink fs2(""ecies.pub.der"", true /*binary*/);
encryptor.AccessKey().AccessGroupParameters().SetEncodeAsOID(true);
encryptor.GetKey().Save(fs2);

/////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Part three - encrypt/decrypt

string message, encrypted, recovered;

if(argc >= 2 && argv[1] != NULL)
    message = argv[1];
else
    message = ""Attack at dawn!"";

StringSource ss1 (message,   true /*pumpAll*/, new PK_EncryptorFilter(prng, encryptor, new StringSink(encrypted)));
StringSource ss2 (encrypted, true /*pumpAll*/, new FileSink(""ecies.encrypted.bin"", true /*binary*/));
StringSource ss3 (encrypted, true /*pumpAll*/, new PK_DecryptorFilter(prng, decryptor, new StringSink(recovered)));

cout << recovered << endl;


Here is what a private key looks like from the test program above. Notice it has the field encoded into the structure so you don't have to guess at it (P-256 versus P-128 versus P-521).
$ dumpasn1 ecies.priv.der 
  0  65: SEQUENCE {
  2   1:   INTEGER 0
  5  19:   SEQUENCE {
  7   7:     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ecPublicKey (1 2 840 10045 2 1)
 16   8:     OBJECT IDENTIFIER prime256v1 (1 2 840 10045 3 1 7)
       :     }
 26  39:   OCTET STRING, encapsulates {
 28  37:     SEQUENCE {
 30   1:       INTEGER 1
 33  32:       OCTET STRING
       :         00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 02 C2 00 10
       :         2C 18 0F 9E 6A 4E 7A 2F 58 B5 BE 86 BC 17 94 78
       :       }
       :     }
       :   }

And the public key:
$ dumpasn1 ecies.pub.der 
  0  89: SEQUENCE {
  2  19:   SEQUENCE {
  4   7:     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ecPublicKey (1 2 840 10045 2 1)
 13   8:     OBJECT IDENTIFIER prime256v1 (1 2 840 10045 3 1 7)
       :     }
 23  66:   BIT STRING
       :     04 08 9B D2 1C 3A DC 08 8B 1F F1 D0 F4 97 A0 87
       :     FE 4F 78 EA E2 B8 30 B8 E7 06 37 68 27 4C 71 CD

       :     5E
       :   }


Crypto++ has a wiki page on ECIES. See Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme. They also have Bouncy Castle interop workarounds.

You can also PEM encode the keys, but you need a patch to do it because its not part of the library. For the patch, see PEM Pack on the Crypto++ wiki.

"11225439","Where should I put the public key in a standalone application","I wrote an C# WPF application that signs a license xml file using the standard .Net SignedXml class.  I am able to extract the public and private key as xml strings.  I can safely tuck away my private key locally for the signing application, but what about the public key needed in the remote sign check application (library)? Options considered:

KeyContainer: no good, because signing and checking happens in 2 separate environments
Hardcoded: hardcode the public key as xml string in my checking library.  I know the public key is not secret, but how can I prevent hackers from replacing the key with their own? I can sign the library, but then they could tamper with the application using the library....

","I put the public key in a directory outside of the inetpub directory, and if you move the private key off of the computer, then the worst someone could do is to replace the public key and it no longer can decrypt, but you could be informed when it can't decrypt to know something happened.
But, if someone was able to change your file you will have bigger problems that just having this one file changed.
UPDATE:
Oops, I missed that this is a WPF program.  Unfortunately the best you can do is to have the private key separate from the public key, so, you can decrypt, but if the hacker changes the public key the application won't function properly.
That is one of the advantages of using the public/private key, to verify that only you can do the encryption.
The other option is to fetch the public key from a webserver, but then you have the same problem in that it is possible for someone to trick the application to go to the wrong server, so it isn't full-proof, and it will require that the user had an Internet connection, and for you to uniquely identify them.

"11225439","Where should I put the public key in a standalone application","I wrote an C# WPF application that signs a license xml file using the standard .Net SignedXml class.  I am able to extract the public and private key as xml strings.  I can safely tuck away my private key locally for the signing application, but what about the public key needed in the remote sign check application (library)? Options considered:

KeyContainer: no good, because signing and checking happens in 2 separate environments
Hardcoded: hardcode the public key as xml string in my checking library.  I know the public key is not secret, but how can I prevent hackers from replacing the key with their own? I can sign the library, but then they could tamper with the application using the library....

","Put the public key in a standard digital certificate that you distribute with your app. The integrity of the certificate will then be guaranteed by Windows, and you can tell if it's been changed.
Of course both the hardware and Windows itself is under the control of any potential attacker, so you can't really prevent a compromise of a specific machine. 
Here's an example from a program that I used to distribute. When the program was activated from a licence perspective, it sent a hardware hash to a web service. This returned a self-signed certificate containing the hardware hash, which my program then checked whenever it was started. If the certificate had been changed in any way, the program would stop.

"12378876","Private/Public key variant for encrypting data online and decrypting with multiple different keys","Assume the following example:
I have an online service where user can register and enter personal data. Now I want to encrypt these data. I have a private key Pr1 and public key Pu1.

User logs in with password at my online service


Convert login password to fit a private key format = Pr2
Get public key Pu2 from Pr2

User enters data to store them online in the database
Encrypt user entered data with Pu1 and add --recipient Pu2 like Encryption with multiple different keys?
Now I can copy the encrypted data from the online database to my local machine and decrypt the data with my local Pr1
Users can decrypt their already entered data online using their normal password which is converted to their Pr2 every time when they log in (step 2a) but is valid the entire session

With that approach no data can be decrypted even if an attacker has access to my server with all files and the database, right? Sure, a brute force attack is possible but it should take some time as for every try a private key needs to be computed.
But no private key is stored online or needs to be exchanged. So this should be pretty save.
Here the question: If this approach is secure and practicable, then there must be already something similar or better out there which has these functionalities and uses some nice security standards. What is it?
","A bunch of seemingly random thoughts re: why this doesn't tend to be how people do this...
First, for multiple user access. Typically systems I have seen that want to let two users access something with their own creds, but only protect the thing one time, is to create a key to protect the content, then protect that key with multiple credentials and store the key in this form many times. That is to say, you store the key next tot he item itself, but the key is stored N times,once for each accessor. If I grant you access, my cred is used to decrypt the key, then it is stored again with your materials.
Along the same multi-user lines, the ""grant access"" flow is problematic. The scheme you suggest above requires that in order for me to grant you access, the system needs to have my credential (to validate I am who I say I am & have the key in hand) plus your key (to give you access) at the same moment in time. This is pretty problematic in the real world.
This scheme does not afford the user a ""forgot my password"" experience. Lost password -> lost key.
This scheme assumes users pick good passwords.
This scheme means that two users with the same password have the same key.
You assert that theft of DB isn't an issue a they would have to compute all of the passwords (which means downstream keys) but in practice this isn't too hard to do, nor too expensive. And I just need to compute Password123 once and then can scan the entire db for it.
Hope this helps.

I'm trying to export a public key from a x509certificate2 object in PEM format in c# code.
As far as I understand, the difference between a certificate in cer format vs pem format, is only the header and footer

but my question is for the public key.
let pubKey be a public key exported in .cer format from an x509certificate2 object,

------BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

------END PUBLIC KEY------

for the public key. let pubKey be a public key exported in .cer format from an x509certificate2 object

Talking about a "".cer format"" only applies when you have the whole certificate; and that's all that an X509Certificate2 will export as. (Well, or a collection of certificates, or a collection of certificates with associated private keys).
Nothing built in to .NET will give you the DER-encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo block of the certificate, which is what becomes ""PUBLIC KEY"" under a PEM encoding.
You can build the data yourself, if you want.  For RSA it's not too bad, though not entirely pleasant.  The data format is defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3280#section-4.1:
SubjectPublicKeyInfo  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
    algorithm            AlgorithmIdentifier,
    subjectPublicKey     BIT STRING  }

AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
    algorithm               OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
    parameters              ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL  }

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3279#section-2.3.1 describes how RSA keys, in particular are to be encoded:

The rsaEncryption OID is intended to be used in the algorithm field
     of a value of type AlgorithmIdentifier.  The parameters field MUST
     have ASN.1 type NULL for this algorithm identifier.
The RSA public key MUST be encoded using the ASN.1 type RSAPublicKey:
RSAPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
    modulus            INTEGER,    -- n
    publicExponent     INTEGER  }  -- e


The language behind these structures is ASN.1, defined by ITU X.680, and the way they get encoded to bytes is covered by the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) ruleset of ITU X.690.
.NET actually gives you back a lot of these pieces, but you have to assemble them:

        (byte)length,
    };
}

DSA and ECDSA keys have more complex values for AlgorithmIdentifier.parameters, but X509Certificate's GetKeyAlgorithmParameters() happens to give them back correctly formatted, so you would just need to write down their OID (string) lookup key and their OID (byte[]) encoded value in the switch statement.
My SEQUENCE and BIT STRING builders can definitely be more efficient (oh, look at all those poor arrays), but this would suffice for something that isn't perf-critical.
To check your results, you can paste the output to openssl rsa -pubin -text -noout, and if it prints anything other than an error you've made a legally encoded ""PUBLIC KEY"" encoding for an RSA key.

After SSH_MSG_KEXINIT messages there is SSH_MSG_KEXDH_INIT (30) and SSH_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY (31).
my problem is the understanding of SSH_MSG_KEXDH_INIT and SSH_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY.
According to the rfc4253:
First, the client sends the following:

  byte      SSH_MSG_KEXDH_INIT
  mpint     e

The server then responds with the following:

  byte      SSH_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY
  string    server public host key and certificates (K_S)
  mpint     f
  string    signature of H

but with wireshark i see:

what are 'payload' fields? how base 'G' and modulus 'P' are negociated? an ecdsa public key is prime or composite number?
this is my analyze:
a)wireshark is wrong.
If rfc is right, payloads field are 'e' and 'f'!
But there is a problem : if rfc is right, modulus p and base g have to be known BEFORE SSH_MSG_KEXDH_INIT because we need them to compute 'e'; so the wireshark decoding is wrong because wireshark tell me that P and G are transmit AFTER SSH_MSG_KEXDH_INIT.
and there is something else telling me wireshark is wrong : if i decode the base64 that i can find in the /etc/....pub file, i can see the value of wireshark DH_modulus field.
So DH_modulus field is not really DH_modulus but server public host key : rfc is right, wireshark is wrong!
In this case base and modulus are not transmit by ""Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Reply"" so how 'g' and 'p' are transmitted??are they ""prefixed"" in all ssh client/server and never transmitted?
b)wireshark is right
if we suppose server public host key is a prime number it can be DH_modulus and rfc AND wireshark are right.
but in this, there is again a problem : payload from client can't be 'e' because payload is transmit before DH_modulus and DH_base...
so what are the payload field? 
when 'e' and 'f' are sent? because just after ""Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Reply"" i have ""Newkeys messages"" which indicate the end of key exchange
but on other hand i have 4 packets to/from port 22 which are not decoded as ssh but it is maybe ""e"" and ""f""??
first two packet are 48 bytes length and the 2 others are 64bytes length.
are 'e' and 'f' transmitted in these 4 tcp packets ? maybe e and f are 64+48=112 bytes length?
as you can see i'm in confusion. can you help me (maybe not for all question but some indications can help)
thank you.
","In this case it's Wireshark incorrectly interpreting the public key algorithm.  Packet number 13 which came from the server is properly formatted according to RFC5656 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656).  It's using the ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 algorithm which is an elliptic curve algorithm with 2 variables: q and r.
Wireshark is improperly parsing this packet using a different RFC (although not strictly 4253).  RFC5656 section 3.1 will give you the information you need to get on the right track.  For your information I'll post variables r and s in this response.
In reality, the information contained is:
Server's public host key (string K_S):
    string  ""ecdsa-sha2-nistp256"" (where ""nistp256"" is the [identifier])
    byte[n]  ecc_key_blob
               string  ""nistp256"" (repeated again as [identifier] portion of blob)
               string   Q (where Q is as follows)

Signature on the exchange hash (string):
    string  ""ecdsa-sha2-nistp256"" (again where nistp256 is the [identifier])
    string   ecdsa_signature_blob
               mpint r (011c-013c):
                                      00 84 0a a1

db 55 9f 5d e9 fa 48 87   b2 2e 97 3c 46 59 7a 14

Hopefully this helps clear up the confusion.  You'll still have a bit of research to do with RFC5656 and possibly referring back to RFC4253 to fill in the blanks but that is the breakdown of the packet.

If your major threat is someone running a debugger on the app to catch the data, then you've got a massively bigger problem and will be highly unlikely to ever stop someone from ""stealing"" the data.

","A bump to @Marc B for pointing out that SSL is perfectly secure, but if you absolutely need custom encryption...
If the server supports mcrypt (most PHP implementations do), then you can use any of the encryption methods provided by mcrypt (including modern AES implementations, IDEA, TEA, etc, etc, etc [it's a long list actually]). However, the php script (of course) must be written to expect encrypted data.
Check out http://php.net/manual/en/book.mcrypt.php for information about PHP's implementation of mcrypt.
EDIT: A quick dump of print_r(mycrypt_list_algorithms()) on a nearly stock fedora box with php-mcrypt installed shows...

"48016033","How do I encrypt an email using a Yubikey?","I am fairly new to PGP encryption. I generated a new key pair last week on a Yubikey, while previously I had only used a private key that I generated on my machine. I use thunderbird enigmail for key management. This is probably a stupid question but I don't actually understand how to encrypt an email using the private key stored on my Yubikey. I can decrypt just fine but can't figure out how to compose an encrypted email from the new key. Using my old key pair, it's automatic - how do I actually encrypt using the right private key? At what point do I enter the Yubikey and pin? (I'm not all that technical and I use encryption for one specific project, so I appreciate dumbing down something that is probably very obvious.) 
","Using keys generated on a Yubikey is a practically identical process to using your old keys, with one extra step of set up.
To use keys stored on a Yubikey, you need ""key stubs"" registered on your PGP system. Basically, these are references that tell your PGP software ""This private key is located on smartcard number #123456."" Once you have the stubs to the keys you need, Enigmail should treat the Yubikey-stored keys like any other PGP key.
I'm only familiar with GnuPG, so specifics may vary, but using GPG you need to 

Have a copy of the public key imported to your system from a key server or the like.
Import key stubs from your smart card (in this case, your Yubikey) using:
gpg --card-status


After that, checking your private keyring should reflect that you have stubs pointing to private keys stored on a smart card (denoted by the > after sub). I.E.
gpg --list-secret-keys

At this point you can use sub keys of CDEF1234 as if there were on your system. Your PGP software ought to handle checking the card is inserted and dealing with PIN entry.

javax.crypto.IllegalBlockSizeException: 
Data must not be longer than 117 bytes

So what am I supposed to use to securely send the sealed object containing my symmetric key?
","As @zapl comments, DSA is not an encryption algorithm, and RSA can only encrypt data with size less than the key size minus a small mostly-fixed overhead (11 bytes for PKCS1, which is the default and thus you used; somewhat more for OAEP).
Although not in your posted code, I'll bet the problem is you are trying to seal the SecretKey object. Encryption works only on byte (or bit) sequences, represented in Java by byte arrays or sometimes portions of arrays, so SealedObject actually serializes the object you give it to bytes and encrypts those bytes, and conversely decrypts those bytes and deserializes them to re-form the object. Java serialization has some overhead, and the various Key types in particular are organized in a hierarchy that exacerbates this. For example serializing a SecretKey from KeyGenerator.getInstance(""TDES"") is 282 bytes, much too large for RSA-1024 which as your exception says can only be 117 bytes.
Instead seal only the bytes of the key value obtained by SecretKey.getEncoded(). On the receiver (server) put the bytes back in a SecretKeySpec (with the correct algorithm; send that also if not fixed in advance) and you can actually use it as Key for symmetric even without running it through a factory (unlike asymmetric keys which have more structure). Even a simple byte[] has some serialization overhead, but not enough to cause a problem here.

I need encryptar email so that I can open with the public key of who is reading (and which was used to encrypt the message). 
I already tried several ways, but I always have problems when decrypting.
","You cannot do that. You will have to store the cert instead of just the public keys.
When a mail client receive a email, it has to know which private key to use to decrypt it - or it will just fail to decrypt. 
How does the mail client knows which private key to use? Because recipient information is also in the encrypted mail.
You can't just encrypt your data encryption key with any random public key and hope the receiver knows which key can be used to decrypt it.
That's why the BouncyCastle API takes a certificate instead of a key.

can any one point me out what i'm doing wrong here.
","I can't reproduce your problem. Here is a little SSCCE that fails to demonstrate the problem:
(Note: this would have been easier if the code sample you had supplied was also an  SSCCE)
import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.security.GeneralSecurityException;

import android.util.Base64

import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory;
import javax.crypto.spec.DESKeySpec;

public class EncryptDecryptTest {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    String key = ""12345678"";
    String ciphertext = encrypt(key, ""foo"");

    String decrypted = decrypt(key, ciphertext.trim());
    String encrypted = encrypt(key, decrypted.trim());

    if (ciphertext.contentEquals(encrypted.trim())) {
      System.out.println(""decrypted!"");
    } else {
      System.out.println(""wrong key!"");
    }
  }

  public static String encrypt(String key, String data)
      throws GeneralSecurityException, UnsupportedEncodingException {
    DESKeySpec desKeySpec = new DESKeySpec(key.getBytes(""UTF8""));
    SecretKeyFactory secretKeyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""DES"");
    SecretKey secretKey = secretKeyFactory.generateSecret(desKeySpec);
    byte[] dataBytes = data.getBytes(""UTF8"");
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""DES"");
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);
    return Base64.encodeToString(cipher.doFinal(dataBytes), Base64.DEFAULT);
  }

  public static String decrypt(String key, String data)
      throws GeneralSecurityException, UnsupportedEncodingException {
    byte[] dataBytes = Base64.decode(data, Base64.DEFAULT);
    DESKeySpec desKeySpec = new DESKeySpec(key.getBytes(""UTF8""));
    SecretKeyFactory secretKeyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""DES"");
    SecretKey secretKey = secretKeyFactory.generateSecret(desKeySpec);
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""DES"");
    cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey);
    byte[] dataBytesDecrypted = (cipher.doFinal(dataBytes));
    return new String(dataBytesDecrypted);
  }    
}

For me, this prints out decrypted! as expected. Note that I performed my testing using standard Java (not Android), but I've tried to repair the code to execute on Android.
Some side comments:

Your constant usage of trim() seems strange. It doesn't seem to achieve anything.
You use contentEquals() when you can just use equals().
You specify DES as the algorithm, which leaves the cipher mode and padding as defaults. You really ought to specify both of those explicitly.
DES is too weak to offer any security, so you might want to consider moving to a stronger algorithm.

","You don't have to distribute the certificate. One of common approaches is to include the certificate in the signed document, in the KeyInfo/X509Data node.
The validation can use the embedded certificate easily and the only required infrastructure element at the client side is the certificate thumbprint and subject name. In other words, client validates the document using included certificate and then easily checks the certificate agaist the subject name and thumbprint. In case of a match, there is the assumption that a correct certificate has been provided.
Read more about technical details in one of my blog entries (this is a 3 part tutorial so you can also take a look at all other entries). Anyway, no importing certificates and no including certificates with your software, rather you have two string configuration parameters.
The embedded certificate inside the XmlDsigned document has a const size and usually the overhead is neglectable.

"13977724","Android app licensing new and old - doubts","Just few weeks ago Google changed Android LVL API (License Verification Library). 
In old LVL license checking was based on license verification using public/private keys generated on per account base. New one suppose to use public/private keys per application base.
I have application which uses old LVL and looks like that it works (looks like, but in fact I don't know). Application embeds public key generated on per account base.
Now what should I supposed to do when I will decide to upgrade my app? Embed public key for application or still use public key for account?
I didn't manage to find any clues on Google's Android developer site...
","It helps to think of the old license key system as deprecated - it still works on old apps, and may continue to work for updates. As with anything that is deprecated and can be disable or removed at any time in the future without further notice, you might not want to wait too long to use the new system - but your old keys should work for now. So if you have to push out an update you might be ok with the old system/keys.
As BadCash suggested, the new license key generation does not yet appear to be an instant process. Once generated it can take anywhere from minutes to a few hours to propagate across their licensing system so it can be recognized as a valid licensing signature.
Please note that Google appears to be moving away from this system entirely, however, as per their site: Google Play Licensing Service
So I would suggest resigning with the new system to avoid future annoyance - if it isn't too much hassle, depending on your number of apps - and sit comfortably knowing that in the future you won't have to do it again at all.

Now I tried to encrypt the string on many ways, but none of them worked.
The last solution I tried was the following:
public static string RSA(string payload, string publicKey)
{
    byte[] toEncryptData = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(payload);

    RSACryptoServiceProvider rsaPublic = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();
    rsaPublic.FromXmlString(publicKey);

rsaPublic.FromXmlString(publicKey);

So what can I do to encrypt the string with RSA?
I need it because I want to implement an API: https://www.loxone.com/dede/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/0903_Communicating-with-the-Miniserver.pdf

The PublicKeyFactory class is from BouncyCastle.Crypto, you can Google it for more information.
Then your rsaPublic.FromXmlString(publicKey) will work fine.

"15725897","Trouble verifying RSA PSS signature in Perl with Crypt::RSA and Crypt::RSA::SS::PSS","I'm unable to verify a PSS-signed signature in Perl using Crypt::RSA and Crypt::RSA::SS::PSS.
Here's the situation:
I have a device that has a 1024-bit RSA key, and signs data using PSS, SHA1 and AES-128.
I extract the device's public key successfully, save it in a file with PEM_write_RSA_PUBKEY()
I am able to verify this in C/C++ using RSA_verify_PKCS1_PSS(), and also using openssl on the command line, like this:
echo -n hello | 
openssl dgst -verify pubkey.pem -signature hello.sig -sha1 \
             -sigopt rsa_padding_mode:pss -sigopt rsa_pss_saltlen:20

Where:

The string ""hello"" is the buffer that's been signed by the device.
""pubkey.pem"" is the device's RSA Public Key, exported from the device
with PEM_write_RSA_PUBKEY(). 
""hello.sig"" contains the binary (raw) signature generated by the device.  (It's 128 bytes, because of the padding.)

I'm trying to do the above in Perl, using Crypt::RSA and Crypt::RSA::SS::PSS, and can't get it to work.
I've tested those two modules and I am able to generate and verify a PSS signature in Perl when generating my own key, like this:
use Crypt::RSA;
use Crypt::RSA::SS::PSS;

my ($message, $rsa, $pss, $signature, $verify);
my ($public, $private);


 # The message to be encrypted
 #
$message = ""hello"";


 # Generate RSA key
 #
$rsa = new Crypt::RSA;
($public, $private) = $rsa->keygen( Size => 1024, Filename => ""key"" );


 # Generate PSS signature
 #
$pss = new Crypt::RSA::SS::PSS;

$signature = $pss->sign ( Message => $message, Key => $private ) || die $pss->errstr;

$verify = $pss->verify ( Message => $message, Key => $public, Signature => $signature ) || die $pss->errstr;

 # $verify returns true, it worked.

So, instead of creating my own RSA key I read in a public key using something like this:
  $publicKey = new Crypt::RSA::Key::Public ( Filename => ""key.public""  );
  ...
 # I pack the 256 character (128 byte) hex string of the signature
 # that's generated by the device.
  $signature = pack (""H*"", '03808458…..73E92'); 

Where ""key.public"" contains the device's public key, converted to a decimal string, inserted into the ""n"" field of the variable that is read/written by Crypt::RSA::Key::Public.
But I can't get it to verify :-(
Methinks I should be able to indicate that it should be using SHA1 and AES-128 (as opposed to, say, Blowfish).
Am I barking up the wrong tree?
Thanks….
","Not sure how to help you with that without being able to make tests with your files and code in order to debug. But, although not the best solution, a good work arround can be to use system calls in Perl. If you are able to verify it on the command prompt, you have some options to check it that way. The first one is system:
my $return_code = system(""some command"");
# or...
my $return_code = system(""command"", ""some"", ""args"");

When you do that, you receive the returned exit code in $return_code. If whatever you're doing to verify it on the command prompt exits with an error code on verification failure, then you know that you'll receive a 0 when everything went well, and another number when it went wrong.
Other way to analyze the answer of a system call, if you want to read the actual answer, id using backticks:
my $answer = `some system call`;
# or...
my $answer = qx[some system call];

By doing that, you'll capture whatever is sent to STDOUT by the system call. If you want to also capture STDERR, then you can redirect it in the same call with 2>&1 or something like that. In this case you don't get the returned exit code.
Depending on the method you used, you can then work with the answer like this:
if ($return_code == 0) {
    print ""Verified!"";
}
# or...
if ($answer =~ /OpenSSL.*?Verification sucess.*?Signature code:(\d+)/) {
    # I'm just making up stuff here, I don't know the answer of your command!
    print ""Verification succesful. Signature code was $1"";
}

I hope this helps. I wish I could test you actual script and files and I could give you a pure-Perl answer, but this at least should help you move forward for the moment.

My question is therefore how do I store the private key in a database securely. (public key doesn't need to be that secure anyways).
I have two methods currently.

Add a passphrase (i.e. the user's master password) to the private key and store that as a string in the database
Encrypt the private key using a symmetric algorithm and store that as a string in the database

Are these methods sufficient? 
Which is better or are they the same thing? 
Are there any better ways?
Update
Some of you might be confused on why I want to even do this. My use case is a team based password management system. Public keys are used to encrypt a password (one for each user in a team) and private key with passphase is used to decrypt the password.
","The first option is likely better, because it's easier to mess up your own symmetric encryption implementation, than to use an existing one correctly. Passphrases on private keys usually mean just some form of symmetric encryption.
PS. I'm not sure why you're using private / public keys here. If it's for proof who uploaded the key - great. If it's for the encryption itself - why not just use symmetric encryption of the stored password instead? If all people privileged to read it know the password to the private key, then there's no big difference. The only thing you seem to gain is being able to cycle the keys without changing the passphrase everybody knows.

this is the method i use to export keys in objc, it seems work just like the java method

    size_t pkeySize = SecKeyGetBlockSize(privateKey);
    NSData* pkeyData = [NSData dataWithBytes:privateKey length:pkeySize];
    NSString* pkeyString = [pkeyData hexadecimalString];

    return pkeyString;

}

","Although it is not impossible to create the same key pair from a seed, you need to make sure that both the RNG and the key pair generation are exactly identical. Furthermore, the seed to be put in the generator needs to be used in the same way. Neither the RNG or the key pair generation is usually created with compatibility in mind. Actually, the default ""SHA1PRNG"" has even changed between versions of Java, and the algorithm is not described.
If you want to use the same private key then it is better to generate it and to transport it to the other runtime. There are multiple ways, but one method is to use a (password) encrypted PKCS#8 or PKCS#12 format. Of course the key or password needs to be kept secret, but that's also the case with your seed value.
For more information, see this Q/A. Don't forget to vote up the question and answer over there, I can use some more points on crypto :).

","As I explained in my other answer, it is very tricky to generate the same key pair using the same value of the PRNG. But that does not seem to be what you are after. It seems that you want to use your own seeded PRNG to generate the key pair.

In general, the default SecureRandom in Java is seeded by the operating system. The idea that you can supply your own random number generator is that you may get ""better"" results using for instance your own entropy pool (e.g. from a a hardware random number generator). Normally the default Java PRNG seeded by the operating system would however provide enough random.
As you are using the SecureRandom class, you supplant the operating system provided seed with your own relatively weakly seeded PRNG. currentTimeMilis certainly does not give you much entropy, and the password seems to be static. This is generally not thought to be enough for generating RSA key pairs.
If you really want to you can add some entropy to the pool instead:
// create runtime default PRNG
SecureRandom rng = new SecureRandom();
// make sure that the rng is seeded by the operating system
rng.nextInt();
// add secret to the pool
rng.setSeed(""SOME_SECRET"".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
// add time information to the pool
rng.setSeed(System.currentTimeMillis());
// use for e.g. RSA key pair generation


There seems to be no method of injecting your own random number generator in Apple's OS X libraries. As indicated, usually the OS provided random number generator is good enough. If you really want to you can write your additional seeds to /dev/random though.

svn co svn+ssh://user@example.com:12345/repos/public

Now, my server currently supports both password based authentication, and public key authentication. Assuming my server at my office is bolted and anchored down, and the firewall and all are working, I don't have to worry about someone copying files off the server.
For my two client laptops, I've generated public-private key pairs, and have added the public keys for the clients to the AuthorizedKeys list on the server via the ssh-copy-id command. I can now SSH into the server from these client laptops without a password.
This concerns me though. If someone breaks into my hotel room and steals my laptop, then they can just pull the hard drive, copy the contents of ~/.ssh to a separate machine, and attempt to log in to my servers effortlessly. If I just used password-based authentication, and just memorize the passwords or store them in an encrypted TrueCrypt archive, it is much safer.
I know that during the creation of my key pairs on the clients, a passphrase had to be entered. Is it possible to require the server to not only validate the public key, but to also require the passphrase to be entered?

","You can protect the keystore on the client with an additional passphrase so one needs to unlock the key to use it but this is configured on the client and cannot be enforced by the server. Using an SSH-agent you need to unlock a key only once and use it as long as the client is in use.

"25198915","pre-generated public/private RSA keys, unable to decrypt in C (works in python)","I generated a public/private keypair with openssl:
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 1024
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -in private.pem -outform DER -out private.der -nocrypt
openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -outform DER -out public.der

Now after that I created test code with Python, that was encrypting and deciphering strings. I took the example straight from PyCrypto documentation, encrypting:
string_to_encrypt = str(raw_input(""Enter a string to encrypt: ""))
print ""Encrypting: %s"" % string_to_encrypt

key = RSA.importKey(open('./public.der').read())
cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(key)
ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(string_to_encrypt)

and decrypting:
dec_key = RSA.importKey(open('./private.der').read())
d_cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(dec_key)
dec_message = d_cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)

Now this works as expected, and next I wanted to try deciphering same using C. I transfer the data via socket to the C application.. but now I'm unable to get the message back to clear text, even though the deciphering is not throwing errors. 
Before I try to decipher the text, I print out the data to the screen, and the bytes match on both ends. The receiving function looks like this:
char* decrypt_packet(char* encrypted_buffer, int size) {
  FILE *keyfile = fopen(""./private.pem"", ""r"");
  RSA *rsa_pri = PEM_read_RSAPrivateKey (keyfile, NULL, NULL, NULL);

  int rsa_private_len = RSA_size(rsa_pri);

  for(i; i < size;i++)
    printf(""%02x:"",(unsigned char)encrypted_buffer[i]);
  printf(""\n"");

  char * decrypt = (char*)malloc(rsa_private_len+1);
  memset(decrypt,0,rsa_private_len+1); //Zero the buffer for printing

  int res = RSA_private_decrypt(rsa_private_len, (unsigned char*)encrypted_buffer, (unsigned char*)decrypt, rsa_pri , RSA_NO_PADDING);
  if(res == -1) {

    ERR_load_crypto_strings();
    printf(""ERROR: %s\n"",ERR_error_string(ERR_get_error(),NULL));
  }
  printf(""size decrypt: %i\n"", res);
  printf(""decrypted: %s\n"", decrypt);
  ....

The deciphering doesn't fail, but the output is garbage (here sending just a test string ""hello world""):
received buffer:

But if I use something else, the decrypt function complains: RSA_padding_check_PKCS1_type_2:block type is not 02 or RSA_padding_check_PKCS1_OAEP:oaep decoding error
Am I correctly calling the RSA_private_decrypt function ? Could the problem be that I'm reading the private.pem file in C (in Python I was reading the .der file)? 
One more thing came to mind. I used default openssl from Ubuntu to generate the keys, but my C application I'm linking against a downloaded and compiled source. The Makefile contains:
SOURCE_FILES = main.c client_handler.c
CC=gcc
$(CC) $(SOURCE_FILES) -o client_control_srv -lpthread -lssl -lcrypto -I/home/jlumme/openssl-1.0.1f_x86/include

what I understood so far is that Each side needs to generate a pair of

Yes. Each side generates key pairs and sends their public keys to each other. Private keys must be kept securely and not disclosed. 
Secret key is generated from recipient private key and sender public key and vice versa. 
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is used to sign data with private key and verify it with corresponding public key.
Elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH): 

is an anonymous key agreement protocol that allows two parties, each
  having an elliptic curve public–private key pair, to establish a
  shared secret over an insecure channel.

I have been able to encrypt and decrypt the string using only C# but the IOS side seems to be incorrect.
In C# i'm using this to decrypt the string:
private static RSACryptoServiceProvider _rsa;
private const int PROVIDER_RSA_FULL = 1;
private const string CONTAINER_NAME = ""KeyContainer"";
private const string PROVIDER_NAME = ""Microsoft Strong Cryptographic Provider"";

The above C# code is just a snippet and not full code.
It seems simple enough, This is what i use for IOS,
        //get nsdata from mod and exp

So once i try to decrypt the data on the C# code i get:
The data to be decrypted exceeds the maximum for this modulus of 128 bytes.
I have googled that error and see its got something to do with keysize, but the keysize after the i import the modulus with IOS is 172 bytes.
But im just exporting the public key with _rsa.ToXmlString(false);
EDIT
I think i fixed my own error,
    //get nsdata from mod and exp
    NSString *mod = publicKeyObjects[0];
    NSData *pubKeyModData= [mod dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
    NSString *exp = publicKeyObjects[1];
    NSData *pubKeyExpData= [exp dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

This is converting a base64 string directly with utf8 and it should be using:
NSData *pubKeyModData = [[NSData alloc] initWithBase64EncodedString:mod options:0];
NSData *pubKeyExpData = [[NSData alloc] initWithBase64EncodedString:exp options:0];

Now i get another error Bad Data
Could someone point me in the right direction here? I also apologise for all the code. I just dont know where the problem is.
","Answered my own question,
//get nsdata from mod and exp
NSString *mod = publicKeyObjects[0];
NSData *pubKeyModData= [mod dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
NSString *exp = publicKeyObjects[1];
NSData *pubKeyExpData= [exp dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

became this:
//get nsdata from mod and exp
NSString *mod = publicKeyObjects[0];
NSData *pubKeyModData = [[NSData alloc] initWithBase64EncodedString:mod options:0];
NSString *exp = publicKeyObjects[1];
NSData *pubKeyExpData = [[NSData alloc] initWithBase64EncodedString:exp options:0];

Then this
OSStatus status = SecKeyEncrypt(key, kSecPaddingNone,
                                (const uint8_t *)[Bytes bytes],
                                [Bytes length], cipherBuffer,
                                &cipherBufferSize);

became:
OSStatus status = SecKeyEncrypt(key, kSecPaddingPKCS1,
                                (const uint8_t *)[Bytes bytes],
                                [Bytes length], cipherBuffer,
                                &cipherBufferSize);

Simple configurations fix.

This is (at least, to me) a fairly complex issue that I've put quite a bit of thought into. You can read my question and also see a test implementation in Ruby (very hastily built, not database-backed, and probably very ugly) at this GitHub Gist if you are so inclined.

Introduction
Imagine one was required to create a web-based password management system
(over SSL! :) with the following requirements:

Individual users sign in to the system using their own unique pass
 phrase.
This pass phrase should be enough to allow the user to use the system
 effectively (e.g. from a smartphone, etc.)--the point being that they
 should not have to keep a key file with them.
Users can store arbitrary-length bits of data in the system (""entries"").
Entries are encrypted in the database in such a way that there is not
 enough information in the database or application alone to read the
 encrypted entries.
Users should be able to ""share"" entries with other users of the system
 so that the other user(s) can read the contents of the entry.

I'm no expert in cryptography. After thinking about it for a while, I came up
with the following.  My question is: is this implementation secure? Am I
missing something? If so, is the above spec even implementable? Or is this
overkill?
Database
The database is set up as such:
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  users                                                                       |
+---------+--------------+--------------+---------------+----------------------+
| salt    | pub_key      | enc_priv_key | priv_key_hmac |                      |
+---------+--------------+--------------+---------------+----------------------+
|  entries                                                                     |
+---------+--------------+--------------+---------------+----------+-----------+
| user_id | parent_entry | enc_sym_key  | sym_key_sig   | enc_data | data_hmac |
+---------+--------------+--------------+---------------+----------+-----------+

Basic Use Cases
Let's imagine two users of the system, Alice and Bob.
Bob signs up for the site:

Bob enters a password. This password is sent to the server (but not
stored).
The server generates a random salt and stores it in the salt field.
The server generates the SHA-256 hash of Bob's password and salt.
The server generates an RSA key pair. The public key is stored as plain
text in the pub_key field. The private key is encrypted via AES-256
using the hash generated from Bob's password and salt as the key and
stored in the enc_priv_key field.
The server generates a hash-based message authentication code for Bob's
private key using Bob's password and salt as the key and stores this in
the priv_key_hmac field.

Bob stores an entry in the system:

Bob enters some data to be stored as an entry along with his password.
This data is sent to the server.
The server generates a key to be used as a key for AES-256 encryption.
The server uses this key to encrypt the data and stores the result in
the enc_data field.
The server generates a hash-based message authentication code for the
data using the generated key and stores this in the data_hmac field.
The symmetric key used to encrypt the data is encrypted with Bob's public
key and stored in the enc_sym_key field.
The server uses Bob's private key to generate a signature for the
symmetric key.

Bob retrieves his stored entry:

Bob enters his password and the ID of the entry to retrieve.
The server generates the SHA-256 hash of Bob's password and salt.
Bob's encrypted private key is decrypted via AES-256 encryption using the
hash.
The server verifies that Bob's encrypted private key has not been
tampered with by checking the HMAC in priv_key_hmac.
The server decrypts the symmetric key stored in the enc_sym_key field
using Bob's private key.
The server verifies that the encrypted symmetric key has not been tampered
with by verifying the signature in sym_key_sign using Bob's public key.
The server decrypts the data using the symmetric key.
The server verifies that the encrypted data has not been tampered with
by verifying the HMAC stored in the data_hmac field.
The server returns the decrypted data to Bob.

Bob shares an entry with Alice:

Bob wants Alice to have access to an entry he owns. He enters his
password and the ID of the entry to share.
The data for the entry is decrypted using the method in ""Bob retrieves
his stored entry.""
A new entry is created for Alice in the same fashion as in ""Bob stores
an entry in the system,"" with the following exceptions:

The entry's parent_entry is set to Bob's entry.
The signature for the symmetric key is calculated using Bob's private
 key (since Alice's private key is not available to Bob).
When Alice accesses this new entry, the existence of a non-null
 parent_entry causes the system to use Bob's public key to verify
 the signature (since his private key was used to create it).


Bob changes the data in his shared entry:

Bob decides to change the data in the entry he shared with Alice. Bob
indicates the entry ID to modify and the new data it should contain.
The system overwrites the data created in ""Bob stores an entry in the
system.""
The system finds every entry with a parent_entry equal to the entry
that was just modified, and for each one overwrites the data created in
""Bob shares an entry with Alice.""

Analysis
Advantages:

It is impossible to decrypt any data from the database without the
password of the user that owns the data, as the private key necessary to
decrypt the data is encrypted with the user's password, and that password
(and it's hash) is not stored in the database.
If a user wants to change their password, only their encrypted private
key needs to be regenerated (decrypt the private key with the old
password/hash, then re-encrypt it with the new password/hash).
Shared entries are stored as actual separate records in the database,
so there is no need to share a key between multiple users/groups of users.

Disadvantages/Problems (that I can think of):

If a shared entry is modified, the system must re-encrypt every child
entry; with a large number of users sharing data, this could potentially
be computationally expensive.
Shared entries depend on the parent user's public key for signature
verification. If the user is deleted, or their key changes, the signatures
are invalid.

Repeated from the introduction: my question is: is this implementation
secure? Am I missing something? If so, is the above spec even implementable?
Or is this overkill?
Thanks for sticking it out this long. I'm interested in your opinions! Am I on the right track, or a complete moron? YOU DECIDE! :)
","No IV storage? I guess you could use AES-256-ECB, but that only lets users store 32 byte passwords, and you need to make sure that the generated private key is only ever used for one encryption. (Your current design seems safe in this respect, but if you want to allow passwords longer than 32 bytes, or ever think of making this key do double-duty, you'll need to store an IV for every encryption with it.)
I don't see the security value of priv_key_hmac and data_hmac; if either the private key or the encrypted data has been tampered with, then garbage output will result from decrypting with the private key or the symmetric key. Bob will surely be suspicious when he can't figure out how to type the BEL character. :) (Will humans ever see the output? A human will likely realize the returned password is incorrect without needing to be told. A computer couldn't tell the difference, so if automated systems will ever use the resulting passwords, then sure, keep the fields.)
There is no mechanism for ""I forgot my password"". Make sure your users know that there is no recovering their data if they forget their password. Users are coddled these days, and might expect to be coddled with your service too.
I see no mechanism for users to specify which entry Bob wants decrypted. You should store a name, or, as ssh(1) does in known_hosts, a hashed version of a name, for each entry. Storing a name directly would remove an SHA-256 operation, but a database compromise that reports the cleartext names of services that a user has accounts with might be every bit as damaging. (Perhaps an online escort service, or off-shore bank, or fight club.)

data using the generated key and stores this in the data_hmac field.
The symmetric key used to encrypt the data is encrypted with Bob's public
key and stored in the enc_sym_key field.
The server uses Bob's private key to generate a signature for the
symmetric key.

Bob retrieves his stored entry:

Bob enters his password and the ID of the entry to retrieve.
The server generates the SHA-256 hash of Bob's password and salt.
Bob's encrypted private key is decrypted via AES-256 encryption using the
hash.
The server verifies that Bob's encrypted private key has not been
tampered with by checking the HMAC in priv_key_hmac.
The server decrypts the symmetric key stored in the enc_sym_key field
using Bob's private key.
The server verifies that the encrypted symmetric key has not been tampered
with by verifying the signature in sym_key_sign using Bob's public key.
The server decrypts the data using the symmetric key.
The server verifies that the encrypted data has not been tampered with
by verifying the HMAC stored in the data_hmac field.
The server returns the decrypted data to Bob.

Bob shares an entry with Alice:

Bob wants Alice to have access to an entry he owns. He enters his
password and the ID of the entry to share.
The data for the entry is decrypted using the method in ""Bob retrieves
his stored entry.""
A new entry is created for Alice in the same fashion as in ""Bob stores
an entry in the system,"" with the following exceptions:

The entry's parent_entry is set to Bob's entry.
The signature for the symmetric key is calculated using Bob's private
 key (since Alice's private key is not available to Bob).
When Alice accesses this new entry, the existence of a non-null
 parent_entry causes the system to use Bob's public key to verify
 the signature (since his private key was used to create it).


Bob changes the data in his shared entry:

Bob decides to change the data in the entry he shared with Alice. Bob
indicates the entry ID to modify and the new data it should contain.
The system overwrites the data created in ""Bob stores an entry in the
system.""
The system finds every entry with a parent_entry equal to the entry
that was just modified, and for each one overwrites the data created in
""Bob shares an entry with Alice.""

Analysis
Advantages:

It is impossible to decrypt any data from the database without the
password of the user that owns the data, as the private key necessary to
decrypt the data is encrypted with the user's password, and that password
(and it's hash) is not stored in the database.
If a user wants to change their password, only their encrypted private
key needs to be regenerated (decrypt the private key with the old
password/hash, then re-encrypt it with the new password/hash).
Shared entries are stored as actual separate records in the database,
so there is no need to share a key between multiple users/groups of users.

Disadvantages/Problems (that I can think of):

If a shared entry is modified, the system must re-encrypt every child
entry; with a large number of users sharing data, this could potentially
be computationally expensive.
Shared entries depend on the parent user's public key for signature
verification. If the user is deleted, or their key changes, the signatures
are invalid.

Repeated from the introduction: my question is: is this implementation
secure? Am I missing something? If so, is the above spec even implementable?
Or is this overkill?
Thanks for sticking it out this long. I'm interested in your opinions! Am I on the right track, or a complete moron? YOU DECIDE! :)
","Why not use certificates for sharing data between users? The use PKCS#12 certificates for holding the PEM and Private keys of users and the PEM per user or per site can sign and encrypt for data verification and security.
A scenario to illustrate.
Bob wants to share with Alice without Eve reading.
Alice gives Bob her public key. Bob adds Alice's public key to his keychain of trusted users. Bob then uses Alice's public key to encrypt a message while using his own PEM to sign the data. Of course this scenario requires that Alice already have a copy of Bob's public key to perform verification of the signature but you get the idea.
Also, why store a salt or iv? Both of these being stored along with at rest data will be accessible in the event of a db compromise.
Best practices...

Use a keyring for each user account for storage of others public keys/PEM certificates
Only use public key encryption for sharing information between accounts
Encrypt data with the users private key that is not to be shared between accounts
Do NOT use AES, RSA or any other reversible encryption for password storage
User specific salts should be used to further enhance hashing algorithm for password and should NOT be stored
Use of AES using a site wide password COULD be used for storage of at rest data to further improve security (but you would run into the problem you have outlined in the CONS section)

It's working very well, but I want to make it secure. I was looking at RSA encryption and found this link: http://javadigest.wordpress.com/2012/08/26/rsa-encryption-example/
The problem is that, I can make a pair of keys, a private key that will be on the server to decrypt the messages and the public key will hard-coded (or somewhere online), in the android application. The problem would be, when the server sends the message back to the client, how will he be able to get it ? That one needs to be send encrypted as well, otherwise, there's no point in doing it. I was thinking about creating a pair of keys for each client, but ... I think it's not the best approach.
All suggestions are welcome
","The solution to this is usually to create a form of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), where the public keys of the clients can be verified when needed. You can do this by putting them into a certificate and sign it by some kind of certificate authority (CA) that you control. That way you don't need to store all the certificates, and you can also revoke certificates of clients that have their key compromised. This is what is normally used by (browser) TLS, especially if client authentication is deployed.
Key management however is a large topic that cannot be handled within one answer.

","AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, it doesn't support public/private key pairs. Whoever can encrypt can also decrypt the ciphertext.
One can combine AES with an asymmetric algorithm like RSA to obtain a hybrid scheme: One uses RSA to encrypt a (random) AES key, and then uses AES to encrypt the actual data. You will still have the RSA overhead of a minimum ciphertext size of about the size of the RSA modulus (since this is RSA's output), though.
I suppose this is actually what your OpenSSL function does, maybe depending on the key type.
There are other public-key schemes, specially those based on elliptic curves, which allow a smaller size overhead for similar security as RSA. (I don't know if these are supported by OpenSSL or its PHP bindings, though.)

","I am not a crypto expert.

why not just use any ordinary large
  non-prime numbers for P , Q

Because there would be more factors. Integer factorization is an attack against public private key encryption. This attack exploits this very relation.
One could more easily find the relation and possible values with more common factors. It boils down to algebra.
N = P * Q
if P and Q are both Prime then N has 4 factors {N P Q 1}
However!
if P and Q both share a factor of 2
N / 4 = P / 2 * Q / 2
If N could have been 0..2^4096 it is now  0..2^4094 and since 2 was a factor another large number was also a factor.
This means that I could find a scalar multiple, P', Q' of P,Q S.T. P',Q' < P,Q 
I don't fully understand the concept myself but I believe this shows where i'm going with this.
You have to search a smaller space until you brute force the key.

","It is perfectly possible to use RSA with a modulus N that is composed of more than two prime factors P and Q, but two things have to be noted:

You must know the exact value of all of these factors, or else you will be unable to derive the private key from the public key upon key generation. The equation for two-prime RSA is 1 = D*E (mod LCM(P-1,Q-1)). If you do know these prime factors, you can perform the calculation. If you don't know the prime factors you can't perform this calculation, which BTW is why it is safe to make the public key E,N public - you can't derive the private key D if you only have the information that is easily derived from the public key, unless you are able to factor N.
The security of RSA is effectively bounded by the magnitude of the second largest prime factor of the RSA modulus N. Finding small prime factors that are less than 2^32 can be done in a fraction of a second on a modern computer, simply by trying to divide the modulus N by each such prime and check if the residue is zero (meaning N is divisible by that number) or not (meaning that number is not a factor of N). If N is composed of only such small prime factors times a single large prime factor Q, it would be trivial to find that Q as well, simply by dividing N by all small factors to get N' and test N' for primality. If N' is a prime, it is the last prime factor Q.

","OAEP uses two hash algorithms: one on the label (fka parameters) and one within the Mask Generation Function (MGF1); these can be different. See 7.1.1 and B.2.1 in rfc8017.
I don't know whether that Go code sets one (and which) or both, but what Java does with that getInstance varies depending on which provider you are using, which in turn depends at least partly on what implementation of Java you are using. The SunJCE provider configured by default in Sun/Oracle and OpenJDK implementations changes only the label hash, keeping MGF1 at SHA1; the BouncyCastle provider changes both. I don't know what IBM and Android do here. 
Once you determine (or guess) what Go is doing you can match it by adding to your .init call an appropriate OAEPParameterSpec and related MGF1ParameterSpec.

Encrypt a Message
Decrypt an encrypted message (created by itself)
Decrypt an encrypted message (Office 2010) as long as it's not signed

Now, i want to decrypt messages that are signed too (as it's usually one step). The Problem: 

If i first try a decrypt, it'll return the encrypted message with different headers. Multiple decryptions lead to the same result.
My thought was using the $content - parameter of the verification - command (openssl_pkcs7_verify). You can see my attempt in the code-comments. 

Nevertheless, i don't have any clues what can be wrong with the second attempt. ANy help would be appreciated!
","Speaking to myself.
Errors i made in the script:

Verification returns -1 (error), but i process it as true (success). The verification never worked.
The Verification is plain wrong. The DETACHED is a constant, not a variable. The ""extracert"" parameter expects a valid file as string containing a valid signature. Though, the idea i had was right (de-signing using the ""content""-parameter).
Order of signing and decryption

What i misunderstood was the way, signatures are processed (and verifications are made).
I assumed the message gets encrypted, then signed. It can be that way, but a lot of tools, including Office2010 first sign the message, then encrypt it. That way you can't check the signature before decrypting and have to de-sign after the decryption.
You can see my debugging-code that works down below. This will help you with your decryption problems when stumbling upon this thread.

","According to http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/security/CryptoSpec.html#AppB (for some weird reason that has two Appendix Bs, and you need to scroll down to the second) Java uses the ASN.1 encoding SEQUENCE ::= { r INTEGER, s INTEGER }
You should be able to generate (and parse) this in Python using pyasn1 - http://pyasn1.sourceforge.net/
ASN.1 is a standard for encoding binary data.  So the information above specifies how the Java code is combining the two values that the Python code returns.  You can therefore do the same, and so maintain the same byte format for the signature.

The ""keyType"" seems to always get passed as ""DSA"", so I've looked at M2Crypto.DSA and that looks promising.  The DSA.sign function however returns a tuple of 2 byte strings that I'm not at all sure what to do with.
","A DSA signature is defined as a pair of integers (called r and s, respectively). The DSA standard does not mandate a specific encoding of such a signature into a sequence of bytes. So every protocol which uses DSA signatures has to define its own encoding.
There are two commonly used DSA signature encodings; one is the direct concatenation of the big-endian unsigned encodings of the r and s values, both being normalized to the length (in bytes) of the q parameter in the public key (the ""subgroup size"", usually a 160-bit prime integer, thus yielding a 40-byte signature). The documentation of M2Crypto.DSA is quite terse, but my guess is that it returns r and s separately but already in that format.
Java uses the other encoding, which is ASN.1 based. This is the encoding used throughout X.509 and anything based on it (including signatures in SSL/TLS). ASN.1 is a generic standard for representation and serialization of structured data. In this case, the signature should be the serialization of an ASN.1 SEQUENCE containing two INTEGER values (r and s, in that order). As per the ASN.1 and DER encoding rules, the signature shall then have this format:
0x30 A 0x02 B R 0x02 C S
where:

R is the big-endian signed encoding of r, of minimal length: this means that the first byte shall have a value between 0 and 127, and it shall have value 0 only if the second byte has a value between 128 and 255. In other words, encode r as a sequence of bytes with big-endian convention (most significant byte comes first), making sure that you have as few leading zero bits as possible, provided that you keep at least one (this is what the ""signed"" encoding means: since r is positive, its most significant bit must be 0). Since r is an integer between 0 and q-1, the length of R will be at most one more byte than the length of q, but it can be smaller.
S is the big-endian signed encoding of s (same treatment than for r; note: R and S may have distinct lengths).
B is a single byte containing the length of R (in bytes).
C is a single byte containing the length of S (in bytes).
A is a single byte containing B+C+2 (i.e. the length, in bytes, of what follows the byte A).

Writing specialized encoding and decoding functions for ASN.1-based DSA signatures is a bit tedious but not hard; just take care of producing R and S sequences of the right size. Alternatively, you could use an existing ASN.1 encoding/decoding library, which is overkill but might be easier, depending on your situation.

I understand most of the algorithms involved in generation of public and private keys. But I am struggling to understand what do I do with Bézout's identity to get private key? And also I dont quite understand why Bézout's identity is used at all?
Assume that:
n=55
phi(n)=40    
e = 7

So that e*d mod phi(n) = 1
7*d mod 40 = 1
gcd(40,7) = 1

And so that Bézout's identity looks like this:
3(40)-17(7)=1

Where 40 and 7 are phi(n) and e respectively. 
I know from example that d should be 23.
So am I right that d = e - 17?
If not how do I get d? 
","In your example, d = -17 (since Bézout's identity says that there exist x and y such that x*a + y*b = gcd(a,b)).
You are looking for a d such that e*d = 1 mod phi(n), so you can convert this negative d into a positive value that still satisfies the equation by simply adding a multiple of phi(n). In this case we just need to add phi(n) once, which gives your expected value for d:
-17 + phi(n) = -17 + 40 = 23

","When you don't specify the full transformation, you get the provider defaults, which for RSA is likely RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding.
PKCS1Padding (see Padding schemes) means that random data is added to ensure that encrypting the same plaintext twice will generate different ciphertext.
Ciphers are for encrypting and decrypting. Since you don't intend to ever decrypt a password, a cipher is not the right choice for you.
For one-way ""encryption"", use a message digest, also called a Cryptographic hash function. They work like the Java hashCode() method by generating a hash/digest of the plaintext, but unlike hashCode(), a digest is much more complex in order to ensure that the plaintext cannot be inferred from the digest value.
Since it's a one-way algorithm, you can store the key and the digest value together. The purpose of a digest ensure that you're guaranteed to always get the same digest value from the same plaintext/key combination.
You can even use the same key for all passwords. Remember that it's irreversible, as long as the digest algorithm is strong enough, e.g. SHA-256.

","The random byte array code is fine but why Base64 encode the random bytes, that is really only neccessary for display of perhaps use where only ASCII charactrers are required.
For AES encryption see the Java docs for javax.crypto.
Use SecureRandom to create the iv and prepend it to the encrypted data, it does not need to be secret. On decryption just pick the iv from the data to use for the iv.

","No, if the Javadoc makes no mention of thread-saftey then thread safety is not guaranteed (""synchronization is an implementation detail"").[1] Add a synchronized modifier to your generatePublicKey method (or some other form of locking) to make it thread-safe and be sure to add a Javadoc comment noting that it is supposed to be thread-safe.
See also:

Is there a standard annotation which should be added to the method's Javadoc to denote that a method should be called on a particular thread?
Characterizing thread safety (emphasis mine)

How many times have you looked at the Javadoc for a class, and wondered, ""Is this class thread-safe?"" In the absence of clear documentation, readers may make bad assumptions about a class's thread safety. Perhaps they'll just assume it is thread-safe when it's not (that's really bad!), or maybe they'll assume that it can be made thread-safe by synchronizing on the object before calling one of its methods (which may be correct, or may simply be inefficient, or in the worst case, could provide only the illusion of thread safety). In any case, it's better to be clear in the documentation about how a class behaves when an instance is shared across threads.
[...]
A class's thread-safety behavior is an intrinsic part of its specification, and should be part of its documentation. Because there is no declarative way of describing a class's thread-safety behavior (yet), it must be described textually. While Bloch's five-tier system for describing a class's degree of thread safety does not cover all possible cases, it's a very good start. Certainly we'd all be better off if every class included this degree of threading behavior in its Javadoc.



But maybe....
It looks like your use might be (that is, as hunter pointed out in the comments, once you have a KeyFactory instance, it might be safe to call KeyFactory#generatePublic from multiple threads).
A bit of source diving, KeyFactory.getInstance(String) looks something like so:[2] [3]
public static KeyFactory getInstance(String algorithm)
        throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
    return new KeyFactory(algorithm);
}

Which in turns calls:
private KeyFactory(String algorithm) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
    this.algorithm = algorithm;
    List<Service> list = GetInstance.getServices(""KeyFactory"", algorithm);
    serviceIterator = list.iterator();
    // fetch and instantiate initial spi
    if (nextSpi(null) == null) {
        throw new NoSuchAlgorithmException
            (algorithm + "" KeyFactory not available"");
    }
}

And nextSpi looks like:
private KeyFactorySpi nextSpi(KeyFactorySpi oldSpi) {
    synchronized (lock) {
        // Truncated for brevity
    }
}

And KeyFactory#generatePublic looks something like so:
public final PublicKey generatePublic(KeySpec keySpec)
        throws InvalidKeySpecException {
    if (serviceIterator == null) {
        return spi.engineGeneratePublic(keySpec);
    }
    // Truncated for brevity
}

It does look like the class does some locking in parts and not others, which (I imagine was for a purpose and) means that they took thread-saftey into consideration. It could mean that they had intended for it to be safe to construct and use a factory for the same algorithm on multiple threads but it might also not mean that. You would need to exhaustively check the code paths for race conditions.
That said, please don't build anything assuming a contract other than what's in the Javadoc.

I just want to add the key for my encrypt image and only the person I
  give the key can only decrypt the image

In your code your secret key is byte[] k.
If you want to securely send that to the recipient along with the encrypted image you might want to consider using an asymmetric key encryption algorithm to encrypt your secret key.
In practice, you would use the recipient's public key to encrypt the key used in the AES algorithm. Only they can decrypt that key in order to decrypt the message.

It is a bug to use String as a container for arbitrary random bytes, e.g. userName = new String(encryptorDecryptor.Encrypt(userName.getBytes()));
 is wrong.
I'm not familiar with Blackberry's Java API but in usually you cannot encrypt more than one block with RSA
the toString() methods on arrays (e.g. publicKeySpec.getModulus().toString()) don't return anything useful. You should be able to figure this out just by looking at the data. This is really a beginner java mistake more than a cryptography issue.
Don't using the default character set for the String constructor and String.getBytes() methods. Always specify a character set, usually ""UTF-8"" is perfect.

That's all I had the patience for.

","Add a hash using a shared secret to your ID like this:

The problem I am facing is key protection, if my application is used on a rooted device or is reverse engineered then my key will be exposed and database can be decrypted. 
Please note that my application doesn't ask for password every time user opens it and thus user entered password can't be used as the key. I want to implement behavior like facebook, whatsapp applications, which encrypts data using private-key/key without asking any password and keeps the users logged in all the time. Where and how these applications store their key?
Please suggest a solution/algorithm that will protect the key.Also, does Android OS provides any such functionality for data protection/management?   
","You can use Andriod Keystore to encrypt your SQLCipher password.
I had the same issue while ago, where SQLCipher was used to secure data, but password itself was not. This allowed a security flaw where a simple decompilation would reveal the password as it was in the form of string constant.
My solution was:

Generate a random number when app starts at first. (You can change this behaviour for whatever suits you)
Encrypt this number using Android Keystore.
The original form of the number is gone once its encrypted.
Save this in Prefs.
Now, whenever SQLCipher needs password, it will decrypt it and use it.
Since Android Keystore is providing keys at runtime, and keys are strictly app specific, it will be hard to break this database.
Although everything can be broken but this approach will make it a lot harder for the attacker to retrieve data from DB, or DB password.

Here is a sample project I made which also has a SQLCipher use case same as yours.

Please note that my application doesn't ask for password every time user opens it and thus user entered password can't be used as the key. I want to implement behavior like facebook, whatsapp applications, which encrypts data using private-key/key without asking any password and keeps the users logged in all the time.

Please suggest a solution/algorithm that will protect the key.Also, does Android OS provides any such functionality for data protection/management?

These parameters are artificially small. Probably too small.
One of the properties of RSA is the message size must be smaller than the modulus size. 3x11 = 33, and that's 25 (give or take). So your message must be smaller than 5 bits.
Crypto++ specifies messages sizes in bytes, not bits. So you will likely never be able to encrypt anything under the modulus of 33.
Unfortunately, the cited wiki page does not discuss that size_in_bits(message) < size_in_bits(modulus). And I can't change it at the moment because Crypto++ is broken for writes (reads are OK).
Also, here's from rsa.cpp:
if (modulusSize < 16)
  throw InvalidArgument(""InvertibleRSAFunction: specified modulus size is too small"");

So you should probably specify a modulus at least 216 in size. 216 is 65536.
Finally, until we see the relevant parts of your program and error message, this is just speculation.

RSA Encryption, getting bad length 

I am trying to encrypt a large string using RSA. .NET's default implementation lets me encrypt easily small strings, but when I pass large one it throws a CryptographyException: Bad length.
I would like to overcome this, but the problem is that I need to pass the encypted string to another application which I cannot modify (because it's not mine ;-)
So is there an RSA implementation which I can use to load X509 Public Key and then encrypt large strings?
Thank you
","You will need to contrive something in order to accomplish this, perhaps by splitting it into blocks and encrypting each block.
It's not working because the plaintext length in RSA encryption is limited by the length of the key, i.e. it is impossible to encrypt a piece of data larger than the key used to encrypt it.  Generally, a one-off exchange of a symmetric key is performed with RSA, and an agreed-upon symmetric algorithm is used from there.
Also, RSA is (compared to symmetric algorithms) very computationally expensive and breaking large data into many dozens (perhaps hundreds?) of small blocks would suffer terrible performance problems, you'd probably only be able to encrypt a few megabytes per second.  
Strongly consider an alternate approach.
Edit:  Also, consult the documentation of the program that must accept these encrypted strings, because it doesn't help you to use some nonstandard way of encrypting them if the program will be unable to decrypt them.

","Look at Bouncy Castle cryptography library:
http://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/index.html
I think this library is more flexible then standard from .Net. I used in scenarios when it can do things that standard can't.
Also as a workaround you can split large strings into smaller with length corresponding to encryption key and then use standard .Net classes.
And as final. Are you sure that it's not a problem with padding? When its padding you should fill some part of string to get right length.

"33317847","Setting environment variable through SSH git push","I'm reading Scott Chacon's Git book, and just wanted to confirm something. This part:

You also have access to the user doing the pushing if the push is being run over SSH. If you’ve allowed everyone to connect with a single user (like “git”) via public-key authentication, you may have to give that user a shell wrapper that determines which user is connecting based on the public key, and set an environment variable accordingly. Here we’ll assume the connecting user is in the $USER environment variable, so your update script begins by gathering all the information you need:
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

$refname = ARGV[0]
$oldrev  = ARGV[1]
$newrev  = ARGV[2]
$user    = ENV['USER']

puts ""Enforcing Policies...""
puts ""(#{$refname}) (#{$oldrev[0,6]}) (#{$newrev[0,6]})""


I presume that it's required for the pusher to install a script wrapping around the ssh command. For example, the script would perhaps set the GIT_SSH or GIT_SSH_COMMAND environment variable to point to a shell script that may have something like
#!/bin/bash

HOST=$1
shift
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa $HOST USER=foo $@

Now anytime a git push is done and the remote contains an ssh url, it will invoke that script and update the refs while passing the USER environment variable.
The other way would be to use ""SendEnv USER"" in ~/.ssh/config on the local machine and ""AcceptEnv USER"" in /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the remote git server.
Any other ways that come to mind that expand on the part in bold? I'm particularly looking for a way that doesn't require the pusher to do much work in regards to configuring his environment. Assume everyone's running some form of Windows and needs to setup ssh through some Unix emulator like Cygwin.
","This example is not about the shell or the ssh command.  
It is taken from the ""Server-Side Hook"" section, and describe how to tailored the update hook based on the user (authenticated through ssh)

Here we’ll assume the connecting user is in the $USER environment variable

There is no indication on how this is done, but gitolite (a perl-based authorization layer, which very much needs the user authenticated id) is using ssh forced command: each public key in the ~git/.ssh/authorized_keys include the call to a wrapper script which takes in parameters the user id.
That script will:

execute the git command
fails if this the command is anything else but a git command

In the ~git/.ssh/authorized_keys, you don't have just the public key, but the call to the wrapper with the user id as a parameter:
command=""/wrapper/script userid"",no-port-forwarding,no-X11-for        warding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty ssh-rsa AAAAB3N...
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
         (forced command)

You can see the environment variable being set by the (gitolite here) wrapper script in src/gitolite-shell#L102-L108.

For numbers of a given size (e.g. 1024 bits) the toughest factoring problem is when the number factors into two primes (assuming that they are not too close to the square root of the overall number).

The public and the private key-generation algorithm is the most
  complex part of RSA cryptography. Two large prime numbers, p and q,
  are generated using the Rabin-Miller primality test algorithm. A
  modulus n is calculated by multiplying p and q. This number is used by
  both the public and private keys and provides the link between them.


Between sender and receiver you need 2 keys public and private. But for that you can use any number of primes but generally 2 is used. 

But till now the performance of the algorithm doesn't improve due to any further increase in the strength of the algorithm. 
Also it doesn't make any hard for the attackers. 
The processing time for encryption and decryption will be much more higher. You can check some books on cryptanalysis.

","Say you have a 1024-bit key. With two primes, each is about 512 bits; with three primes, each is about 341 bits. Current factorization methods require exponential time, so each additional bit requires about double the time to find the factor. Thus, two primes are substantially stronger than three primes.
To be specific, a 768-bit key has been factored, and reported in the mathematical literature, which means that a 341-bit factor can be found (the 768-bit factorization took about 2000 PC-years, so it's not easy, but possible). No one has yet reported factorization of a 1024-bit key (although there are doubtless people working on it).

","The TLS protocol only allows for certificates to be exchanged, not raw public keys. Even ""PGP keys"" (if you wanted to replace X.509 with OpenPGP for authentication in TLS, which is much less supported) are in fact certificates (they're the signed combination of a public key and a set of identifiers and attributes).
This being said, you can perform client authentication using self-signed client certificates and rely on their public keys (but you will need to verify this public key against something your server already knows, such as a known list). You need to understand the security implications for implementing this first. This is not quite the same problem as self-signed server certificates. (I'd suggest keeping a more traditional approach to verifying the server certificate.)
You can make the client send a self-signed certificate (possibly using certain tricks regarding the CA list advertised by the server) and either perform the verification in the TLS stack or later in the application.
Note that many application containers (e.g. Tomcat/Jetty in Java) expect the SSL/TLS layer to verify the client certificate. Hence, if you skip the authentication there (and prefer to do it later on within the container or as part of the application), many application frameworks will be confused. You need to be quite careful to make sure that authentication is actually performed somewhere before performing any action that requires authentication in your application.
For example, it can be OK to have a trust manager that lets any client certificate through in Tomcat/Jetty, but you can't rely on the javax.servlet.request.X509Certificate request attribute to have been verified in any way (which most frameworks would otherwise expect). You'd need to implement some verification logic within your application: for example, having a filter before any authenticated feature that compares the public key in this client certificate with your known list of public keys (or however you want to match the public key to an identifier). Alternatively, you can also perform this verification within your custom trust manager (in Java), this will require less work within the applications.
You could do something similar in an Apache Httpd + PHP setup (for example), using SSLVerifyClient optional_no_ca. Again, your PHP application could not rely on the certificate having been verified, so you would have to implement so verification there too.
Don't do any of this unless you understand at which stage the certificate information you get has been verified.

","Your code stores the value of atag key as a SecKeyRef, which does not respond to NSString methods (it is a CFTypeRef).
Consider using: 
NSString* publicKeyDescription = (NSString*)CFCopyDescription(publicKey);

CFStringRef and NSString are tollfree bridged (you will have to cast the correct bridge cast).
Then with that NSString in hand, you should be able to use the provided answer code to find the modulus inside the string.

From what I understand a JWT is just three JSON objects encoded into base64 separately from one another. Then the Base64 strings are separated by periods. This is done purely for ""shorter message"" purposes? 
These include a header, ""payload,"" and signature. The header and payload are 100% available to read by anyone who intercepts them. They are just base64 strings that can be decoded into JSON and read. 
Then the MAGIC: The server receives the SIGNATURE, which cannot be decoded. The signature is actually a hash of the header, payload, AND a secret key. So the server takes the header, the payload, and ITS OWN secret key, and makes a hash. If this hash MATCHES the signature that came with the message, the message is trusted. If the signatures DO NOT match, the message is invalid.

My problem with all this? Where are the two separate keys here? It seems that the key used to encrypt the message and the key used to decrypt the message are the same. This is the root of my question - if you answer nothing else, please help with this. 
Other than that, I wonder if I understand the process correctly? Also, where is the standard ""agreeing on a public key"" and then trading ""mixtures"" of public/private keys occurring here?

JWT header and payload are JSON objects but the signature is not, that's a base64url encoded binary blob
the whole JWT is available to anyone who intercepts it, all 3 parts of it
you're describing a symmetric key algorithm, where sender and receiver use the same shared key; that is just one option for JWTS, another option is to use public/private key pairs for signing/validation/encryption/decryption

There is no magic here.  JWT supports four well-known signature and MAC (message authentication code) constructions: HMAC (a symmetric algorithm), and ECDSA, RSASSA-PKCS-v1.5 and RSASSA-PSS (public-key algorithms).  Each of these may be used with the SHA-256, SHA-384 or SHA-512 cryptographic digest.

  seems that the key used to encrypt the message and the key used to
  decrypt the message are the same. This is the root of my question - if

There are not necessarily two separate keys - if a public key algorithms is used, the signature will be created using the server's private key, and verified using the corresponding public key.  But if an HMAC algorithm is used, a shared secret key must be used for both signing and verification.

A well-formatted ASN.1 public key should include the algorithm as well. We should have a line similar to:
  5   9:     OBJECT IDENTIFIER rsaEncryption (1 2 840 113549 1 1 1)

The AsymmetricCryptoManager.getPublicKeyData() returns a very barebones  ASN.1 key, without any algorithm information. This makes Go very unhappy as it has no way of knowing what kind of key it is. See more about correctly exporting the key here.
If you can change the iOS code, you should instead use CryptoExportImportManager and use one of exportPublicKeyToPEM or exportPublicKeyToDER. These take the output of getPublicKeyData and generate output usable by other tools. You can find an example of how to use them in the CryptoExportImportManager example.
If you cannot change the key export code, you can instead parse it directly in Go. This assumes that you know for sure that it is a RSA public key:
func main() {
    publicKeyBase64 := ""MIGJAoGBAJJYXgBem1scLKPEjwKrW8+ci3B/YNN3aY2DJ3lc5e2wNc0SmFikDpow1TdYcKl2wdrXX7sMRsyjTk15IECMezyHzaJGQ9TinnkQixJ+YnlNdLC04TNWOg13plyahIXBforYAjYl2wVIA8Yma2bEQFhmAFkEX1A/Q1dIKy6EfQ+xAgMBAAE=""

    // Base64 decode.
    publicKeyBinary, err := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(publicKeyBase64)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // rsa.PublicKey is a big.Int (N: modulus) and an integer (E: exponent).
    var pubKey rsa.PublicKey
    if rest, err := asn1.Unmarshal(publicKeyBinary, &pubKey); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    } else if len(rest) != 0 {
        panic(""rest is not nil"")
    }

    fmt.Printf(""key: %+v\n"", pubKey)
}

This prints out:

"6448226","Using Rjindael and RSA to encrypt data stored in QR code in Visual Basic .NET","I'm wanting to encrypt some data (hopefully under five hundred bytes' worth) and store it in a QR code. Originally I wanted to use RSA, so the data would be signed with User A's private key and User B's public key, but unfortunately, VB.NET doesn't like encrypting that much data. I've read that I should use Rjindael to encrypt the actual data, and then use RSA to encrypt the key used by Rjindael. However, I'm not having much luck being able to search the web for some kind of tutorial or something.
Also, if I was wanting to store this on a QR code, wouldn't I have to store both the encrypted data and the encrypted key used by Rjindael? Do you think this would all fit? I may be able to use version 40 on medium error correction (according to http://www.denso-wave.com/qrcode/vertable4-e.html, it stores 18,672 ""data bits""), but I would prefer to use a lower version (that is, smaller) if at all possible.
Generating the QR code won't be the problem (I know there's a .NET library for that), I'm just curious about getting the data encrypted to begin with.
Thanks for your help!

","Look at the ""binary"" column. This is actually how many bytes you can store.
Anything above version 10 gets a bit hard to scan in practice, though possible. Above version 20 it's quite difficult from a camera, though can be scanned off a printed page. So if the point is to scan with a camera -- no doesn't sound like it will fit in practice.

Here is my code:
  public class KeyTest {
private BigInteger n = new BigInteger(""33"");
private BigInteger e = new BigInteger(""3"");
private BigInteger d = new BigInteger(""7"");

public static void main(String[] args) {

The output is:

","Your plaintext (55) is larger than the the modulus (33), so you can't actually encrypt the message. Consider the following slightly different example:

p = 11
q = 17
n = 187
phi(n) = 160
Choose e = 3
If d = 107 then e * d = 321 = 1 mod phi(n)

So change your code to:
  private BigInteger n = new BigInteger(""187"");
  private BigInteger e = new BigInteger(""3"");
  private BigInteger d = new BigInteger(""107"");

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    KeyTest test = new KeyTest();

    BigInteger plaintext = new BigInteger(""55"");
    System.out.println(""Plain text: "" + plaintext);

    BigInteger ciphertext = test.encrypt(plaintext);
    System.out.println(""Ciphertext: "" + ciphertext);

    BigInteger decrypted = test.decrypt(ciphertext);
    System.out.println(""Plain text after decryption: "" + decrypted);
  }

  public BigInteger encrypt(BigInteger plaintext) {

    return plaintext.modPow(e, n);
  }

  public BigInteger decrypt(BigInteger ciphertext) {

","If we test this situation empirically, we will see, that everything longer than 117 bytes will fail:
$msg = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm';

The line above represents 117 characters and 117 bytes in total. This works when encrypting with the public key you provided.
If I add another character, n, encryption fails:
$msg = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmn';

Same thing goes with other unicode characters. Let's say I try to encrypt this, which is 85 characters long, but exactly 117 bytes in length:
$msg = ' i ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui  u';

This gets encrypted perfectly. But if I add another byte, it fails (86 characters, 118 bytes):
$msg = ' i ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui ♥ ui  uZ';

Because RSA is expensive, and was never intended for encrypting quantities of data, if you are encrypting something that is routinely longer than 56 characters, you should be planning to encrypt your data using a fast and efficient symmetric algorithm like AES with a randomly generated key.

","No, it's telling you the account is locked, not that it doesn't have a password. You lock and account to prevent people from logging in using that account; even via SSH. You generally can only switch to a locked account using su or sudo.
The rules are described in the shadow manual page which says:

If the password field contains some string that is not a valid result of crypt(3), for instance ! or *, the user will not be able to use a unix password to log in (but the user may log in the system by other means).

The logic is * will never match a password, but doesn't mean locked, while ! means locked.
This encrypted password is stored, generally, in the shadow file and can be changed using the passwd command or the usermod command. If you wish to change the password to one that doesn't work, then you can change to one starting with *, which will never match a password, so, for example, using the usermod command:
bubble ~ [2]> sudo usermod -L freerad
bubble ~> sudo grep freerad /etc/shadow
freerad:!*:16197:0:99999:7:::

This is a locked freerad account. ssh should prevent you from logging in using that account even if you use public/private key pairs.
bubble ~> sudo usermod -p '*' freerad
bubble ~> sudo grep freerad /etc/shadow
freerad:*:16291:0:99999:7:::

This freerad account has a never-matchable password. The account is not locked, but if you were to login using ssh public/private keys it would not prevent you from logging in.

I have created a user on the server and set up the ~/.ssh directory with my public key and correct permissions.
The user is currently marked as 'locked' because it does not have a password. This causes openssh to refuse the connection.

Ideally, I don't want a password. I have already authenticated via PKI.
Perhaps I could set the password to 'password', or a random string - but that seems messy.
Any recommendations?
EDIT:
Just to clarify, my account is locked because it doesn't have a password, i.e.
$ passwd -u foo
passwd: unlocking the password would result in a passwordless account.
You should set a password with usermod -p to unlock the password of this account.

Petesh solution is correct:
usermod -p '*' foo

From the man page for shadow:
""If the password field contains some string that is not a valid result of crypt(3), for instance ! or *, the user will not be able to use a unix password to log in (but the user may log in the system by other means).""
","Try unlocking it with 
passwd -u foo

Being locked and not having a password are two different things.

Cryptographic Right Answers
In particular, the very first question answered is:

Encrypting data: Use AES in CTR (Counter) mode, and append an HMAC.
AES is about as standard as you can get, and has done a good job of
  resisting cryptologic attacks over the past decade. Using CTR mode
  avoids the weakness of ECB mode, the complex (and bug-prone) process
  of padding and unpadding of partial blocks (or ciphertext stealing),
  and vastly reduces the risk of side channel attacks thanks to the fact
  that the data being input to AES is not sensitive. However, because
  CTR mode is malleable, you should always add an HMAC to confirm that
  the encrypted data has not been tampered with.

And the very next question answered is:

AES key length: Use 256-bit AES keys.
Theoretically speaking, 128-bit AES keys should be enough for the
  forseeable future; but for most applications the increased cost of
  using 256-bit keys instead of 128-bit keys is insignificant, and the
  increased key length provides a margin of security in case a side
  channel attack leaks some but not all of the key bits.

[EDIT 1] Also, the fact that you've applied a ""public-key-encryption"" tag to your question implies that your understanding of cryptography could be better. Please also read chapter 5 of Security Engineering (PDF) by Ross Anderson; it's free and very accessible.

RSA-ONLY: Use RSACryptoServiceProvider to encrypt all data using public key. 
Iterate through the data in blocks that are less than the key size
minus padding.
HYBRID: Use AesCryptoServiceProvider to encrypt the data, calling
.GenerateKey() and .GenerateIV() to generate a random key and IV.

","in most cases RSA is used to encrypt a symetric key (you don't really need to encrypt the IV, but hey...)
if you use RSA for encryption of data (instead of a key) you might run into the ECB (Electronic Code Book mode) problem that is known in the context of symetric block cyphers: for a given key, a clear-text is always mapped to the same cypher-text ... that alone doesn't help in breaking the encryption, but it can leak information since an attacker can identify which data packages contain the same clear-texts 
i'd choose the hybrid approach, because it's suitable for arbitrary sized data, and won't be prone to this information leak unless you choose ECB for the mode of operation (CBC - Cypher Block Chaining mode - should do)

On server side I will encrypt a message using this public key and send the encrypted message to client , which the client decrypts using its private key.The algorithm agreed upon is 'RSA'.
The problem is on server side I am seeing that certain keys are working using X509EncodedKeySpec as key spec

X509EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(publicBytes);

PKCS #1 or X.509 for encoding the key . My question is which one is better for my use case? Any guidelines when to use which format?
","There's very little difference. The key format Java calls X.509, more exactly known as the ASN.1 structure SubjectPublicKeyInfo (or SPKI) defined in X.509 or equivalently and more conveniently in RFC5280 sec 4.1, is a quite simple way to handle a large and flexible set of algorithms: it consists of a substructure AlgorithmIdentifier which identifies the algorithm and its parameters if applicable, then an opaque BIT STRING which contains the actual key information (encoded) in a format depending on (the algorithm identified by) the AlgorithmIdentifier. 
For RSA, the algorithm-dependent part is the ASN.1 structure RSAPublicKey defined in PKCS1 or more conveniently RFC8017 appendix A.1.1 and its earlier versions, and duplicated in RFC3279 sec 2.3.1. Thus for RSA the X.509 (SPKI) format contains the PKCS1 format, and since RSA doesn't have parameters (or at least key-related parameters), the only real difference is that the X.509 format explicitly specifies that the key is RSA -- which in your application you already know.
You have already discovered that vanilla (Oracle-was-Sun-now-OpenJDK) Java crypto, aka JCA Java Cryptographic Architecture, directly supports only the X.509 (SPKI) format, which is a minor advantage. However if you use BouncyCastle it is much easier to convert back and forth than the code in your Q; you simply use the org.bouncycastle.asn1.x509.SubjectPublicKeyInfo class to add or discard the AlgorithmIdentifier:
    // test data source
    KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS""); ks.load (new FileInputStream (args[0]), args[1].toCharArray());
    byte[] spkienc = ks.getCertificate(args[2]).getPublicKey().getEncoded();
    System.out.println (DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(spkienc));

    // extract PKCS1 part of original SPKI
    byte[] pkcs1enc = SubjectPublicKeyInfo.getInstance(spkienc).parsePublicKey().getEncoded();
    System.out.println (DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(pkcs1enc));

    // rebuild SPKI from the PKCS1
    AlgorithmIdentifier algid = new AlgorithmIdentifier(PKCSObjectIdentifiers.rsaEncryption, DERNull.INSTANCE);
    byte[] spki2enc = new SubjectPublicKeyInfo (algid, pkcs1enc).getEncoded();
    System.out.println (DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(spki2enc));

See my answer to the similar golang x509.MarshalPKIXPublicKey vs x509.MarshalPKCS1PublicKey() and especially the links to:
Converting A public key in SubjectPublicKeyInfo format to RSAPublicKey format java
Generating RSA keys in PKCS#1 format in Java
Problem transmiting a RSA public key, javaME , bouncy castle 
If you don't have BouncyCastle, it's a little harder; you need to write a partial ASN.1 parser or generator. Full ASN.1 processing is rather complicated, but for this case you need only a small subset that isn't too bad. (Yeah, that's faint praise.) I may add this later if I have more time. 
A much bigger potential issue is that your key is not authenticated. The hard part of public key distribution, much harder than tiny format details, is making sure that only the legitimate key is distributed. If an attacker can substitute their publickey for the correct one, then the victim encrypts the supposedly secret data in a way the attacker can easily read, and all your fancy cryptography code is completely worthless.
This is why most actual systems don't distribute bare publickeys, but instead certificates that allow verifying the key is the correct key. There are a few certificate schemes, but the most widespread by far is X.509 and its Internet profile PKIX -- in fact the RFCs I referenced above, 5280 and 3279, are part of PKIX. SSL-now-TLS uses X.509. Code-signing uses X.509. S/MIME email uses X.509. (PGP/GPG uses a different kind of certificates, not X.509, but still certificates.) And (vanilla) Java directly supports X.509 certificates just as well or even better than it does ""X.509"" (SPKI) publickeys.

"42525861","How to encrypt your Travis keys","The Travis docs say that the easiest way to encrypt keys eg. To upload to S3,  is to use their command line tool.
Are there other ways to do this that doesn't involve installing Ruby etc just to use their command line tool?
","There happens to be a Javascript method, and it's available here with the corresponding github repo here.
To use encrypted S3 keys is moderately confusing because the principles are not well explained in the Travis docs.
In the top left field of the form mentioned above you enter your Travis-CI userid/repo-name so this allows the script to pull down the public key for your repository that has been created by Travis.
In the right top field, you enter:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:...the..access..string..from..Amazon.IAM...

Click on Encrypt and copy the string generated below Encrypted Data
Then in the right top field, you enter:
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:...the.very.secret.string.from.Amazon.IAM...

and again copy the encrypted string. Note that the encrypted strings change each time due to random data being included into the encrypted strings.
These encrypted key pairs are decrypted by Travis and exported as environment variables.  You enter them in the .travis.yml file like this:
global:
        # travis encrypt AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        - secure: ""--first-very--long-encrypted-string--="" 
        # travis encrypt AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
        - secure: ""--second--very-long-encrypted-string--=""
        - AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME: yourbucketname

Now in the deploy section, you reference them by using the names you used for the encryption pair
deploy:
   provider: s3
   # these are set up in the global env
   access_key_id: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   secret_access_key: $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   bucket: $AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME
   skip_cleanup: true
   upload-dir: travis-builds

If you had used the name ACCESS_ID in global env when you encrypted it, then in deploy you would refer to it as $ACCESS_ID
The upload-dir is created in the named bucket.
When your build runs in Travis, the decrypted keys are not exposed.  Instead what you see is:
See https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/workers/container-based-infrastructure/ for details.
Setting environment variables from .travis.yml
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[secure]
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[secure]

However, the service that will provide the public key for encryption in production represents modulo and exponent in hex values. My question now is, how can I easily transform these values created by node forge from decimal to hex (I then want to use these values in NodeRSA (https://github.com/rzcoder/node-rsa)):
let pair = nodeforge.pki.rsa.generateKeyPair();

var key = new NodeRSA();

The reason I want to do that is that I want to test if the encryption facility works correctly (first, encrypt a value with the public key, then decrypt the value with the private key again), because the public key is provided by an external party and else I have no possibility to check, as the private key is not provided.

","You can't rely on calling toString() on a byte array to inspect its contents.  The returned value doesn't tell you what the bytes are.
If you really want to check the contents of a byte array and see whether it changes or not, use Arrays.toString(byteArray) instead.  And then you should be able to verify that the byte array does indeed change.

This just shows arrays inheriting Object.toString() in the sense of showing the (useless) address as hash value. Hence, toString() lets all arrays look alike no matter what length or content.
Probably, Mudit wants to see the array's content. Adding
System.out.println(""Session key in String   ""
                                     + Arrays.toString(genratesessionKey1));

yields
Session key in String   [106, 97, 118, 97, 120, 46, 99, 114, 121, ....

Rationale: Downward compatibility forbade to enhance the (useless to repeat me) method toString() of all Arrays. Hence, what Mudit and many others expect was put as static methods in the helper class java.util.Arrays since Java5.

"40582147","PGP Encryption Fails on Large Files","I'm in this weird situation.
I'm trying to encrypt this 11GB which has ~42 Million rows in it using PGP with RSA/Armored Public Key.
Here are the commands I used:
Import Key -> 
gpg --import ~/underwood/keys/my_pub_4096_RSA_key.asc 
PGP Encryption -
gpg -r ""underwood@publickey.com"" -o /usr/local/encrrypted-file/encrypted-11GB-file.txt.pgp
--armor --encrypt /usr/local/file-to-encrrypt/this-is-a-11GB-file.txt

`
Issue :
The file size of /usr/local/encrrypted-file/encrypted-11GB-file.txt.pgp is 4GB and row count is only 8M. I'm not sure what happened here. The command completed successfully after 3min without errors. 
Question:  

How do I further investigate this issue ?   
Is there a cap on gpg command on file size ? Because this command workds perfectly fine with 500MB file. 
How do I achieve full encryption on 11GB file ?

One solution I can think on top of my head is to chunk the 11GB in 500MB files and do this. But the problem here, I'm not allowed to chunk the file.  
Please let me know if there is a better solution to this.

","The RSA algorithm does not handle decomposition of the message at all. It just encrypts fixed-size integers. This kind of encryption algorithms is called a block cipher, because it encrypts messages in fixed-size ""blocks"".
How the blocks are obtained is generally not specified by the block-cipher itself. So, you have to decide how to split the message. One of the possible ways to decompose an integer into fixed-size blocks is to convert it to base N, and encrypt each digit separately.
Note that you should not encrypt each digit independently from the others, because that wouldn't be safe. In fact doing so is equivalent to using a monoalphabetic cipher. . There are different mode of operations for block ciphers that you can use to safely encrypt multiple blocks. You should read the wikipedia page to learn about them.

Optional question:
How to encrypt a file with RSA on IOS or python?
","You don't use RSA to encrypt long messages. 
The correct approach is using hybrid encryption instead:

Generate a random AES key, encrypt the actual data with AES. Preferably using an authenticated mode like AES-GCM.
Encrypt the AES key with RSA. This key (126 to 256 bits) is small enough to fit within one RSA block. For example using small and thus weak 1024 bit RSA keys you have 500-700 bits for the actual data (the rest is consumed by the padding).
The ciphertext consists of both the RSA encrypted AES key and the AES encrypted file.
It's essential for security to apply padding here, namely OAEP. Most other paddings, including the popular PKCS#1v1.5 padding are not secure.

Don't try to split the file into blocks which you encrypt with RSA. There are no standard ways for doing this, because it's a bad idea.

What's the cheapest/most-secure way to implement this?
","Use a 3rd party certificate authority: you don't know the private key and you don't have to care about how the client gets and secures the private key (but you can worry about it). Not the cheapest solution ever... 
OR:

Share a secret with each client (printed on paper, through email, phone, whatever...).
Have the client generate the keys based on that secret, time (lets say 5 minute intervals) and whatever else you can get (computer hardware id - if you already know it, client IP, etc...). Make sure that you have the user input the secret and never store it in an app/browser.
Invalidate/expire the tokens often and negotiate new ones

This is only somewhat safe (just like any other solution)...if you want to be safe, make sure that the client computer is not compromised.
It depends on where/how you want to use those keys* but the bottom line is that in the case of asymmetric keys, the client will encrypt the data sent to you (the server) using their private key and you (the server) will decrypt that data using the client's public key (opposite of how HTTPS works).
Can you verify, at any point in time, the identity of your clients?
If the client computer is compromised, you can safely assume that the private key is compromised too. What's wrong with SSL/HTTPS. Do you really need to have one certificate per client?
Tokens are not the same thing as keys and they don't have to rely on public/private keys. Transport, however, might require encryption. 
*my bank gave me a certificate (which only works in IE) used to access my online banking account. I had to go through several convoluted steps to generate and install that certificate  and it only works on one computer - do you think that your clients/users would agree to go through this kind of setup?

What's the cheapest/most-secure way to implement this?
","It would be relatively easy for compromised computers to steal the user's private key if it were stored as a soft public key (e.g., on the hard drive).  (APT (botnet) malware has been known to include functionality to do exactly this.)
But more fundamentally, nothing short of physically incapacitating the user will guarantee non-repudiation.  Non-repudiation is something the user chooses to do, opposing evidence notwithstanding, and to prove that a user didn't do something is impossible.  Ultimately, non-repudiation involves a legal (or at least a business) question: what level of confidence do you have that the user performed the action he is denying having performed and that his denial is dishonest?  Cryptosystems can only provide reasonable confidence of a user's involvement in an action; they cannot provide absolute proof.
PIV cards (and PIV-I cards) use a number of safeguards for signing certificates.  First, the private key is stored on the smart card, and there is no trivial way to extract it.  The card requires a numeric PIN to use the private signing key, and effectively destroys the key after a certain number of incorrect attempts.  The hardware cryptomodule must meet Level-2 standards and be tamper-resistant, and transport of the card requires Level-3 physical security (FIPS 201).  The certificate is signed by a trusted CA.  The PIN, if entered using a keyboard, must be sent directly to the card to avoid keylogger-type attacks.
These precautions are elaborate, intensive, and still do not guarantee non-repudiation.  (What if malware convinces the user to sign a different document than the one he is intending to sign?  Or the user is under duress?  Or an intelligence agency obtains the card in transit and uses a secret vulnerability to extract the private key before replacing the card?)
Security is not generally a question of cheapest/most secure, but rather of risk assessment, mitigation, and ultimately acceptance.  What are your significant risks?  If you assess the types of non-repudiation risks you face and implement effective compensating controls, you will be more likely to find a cost-effective solution than if you seek to eliminate risk altogether.

","The standard way to handle non-repudiation in a digital signature app is to use a trusted third party, a 3rd party cert authority. 
Be careful trying to create your own system--since you're not an expert in the field, you'll most probably end up either losing the non-repudiation ability that you seek or some other flaw.
The reason the standards for digital signatures exist is that this stuff is very hard to get right in a provable way. See ""Schneier's Law""
Also, eventually, non-repudiation comes down to someone being sued--you say that ""B"" did it (signed the agreement, pressed the button, etc), but ""B"" denies it. You say you can ""prove"" that B did it. But so what, you'll need to prove in court that B did it, to get the court to grant you relief (to order B to do something such as pay damages.) 
But it will be very very expensive to sue someone and to prove their case due to a digital sig system. And if you went to all that trouble and then the digital sig system was some homebrew system, not a standard, then your odds of relief would drop down to about 0%.
Conclusion: if you care enough about the digital sig to sue people, then use a standard for digital sig. If you will ultimately negotiate rather than sue, then look at the different options. 
For example, why not use a hardware security token They're now available as apps for people's phones, too.

Remove secret master keys:

Really hope someone know the answer to this problem.
Edit:
If wondering why it is annoying, is because i am using RSA-OAEP between server and client, implementing openssl and webcrypto to encrypt/decrypt AES-CBC keys. AES-CBC encrypted data is exchanged together with the encrypted keys.
My temporary workaround is generating the on server reciding RSA keypair on client and send in clear text. Ok for development, but not appopriate for production. That is the annoying part. XAMPP prior to 7.x.x didn't have AES-CBC methods. By the way XAMPP is only development.

(A) -> (B) -> (C)
Station B receives the file from station A and pass it to station C.
I want to make sure that Station B will not be able to read the content of the file.
In order to enforce that I am using Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption to encrypt the file.

Generating a random symmetric key = SK on station A
Encrypt the file symmetrically using SK as the key.
Encrypting SK asymmetrically with C's public key = AK

Now I need to deliver C both AK and the Encrypted File.
Since B doesn't have the Private Key, he will not be able to retrieve SK and will not be able to decrypt the file.
Question:
1. Is there a way to combine AK and the encrypted File into one big file? (is there any standard way of doing this using OpenSSL). 
The only way i can think of is to make my own format: [AK Len][AK][Encrypted File]
Any libraries in python that can help doing that task?
","Yes, there are several existing standards for encrypting files in this way.

It only requires multiple-precision additions, subtractions, and shifts. The note: 14.64 describes how to optimize the algorithm to obtain the multiplicative inverse - (d) in this case.
It's typical to chose a relatively small prime with a low Hamming weight for (e), like (65537). Since gcd(65537, phi(n)) = 1, the multiplicative inverse will always exist.

I'm trying to make a MacOs app in Swift 4. This app communicates with a api that requires RSA encryption.
Google didn't give results that could explaining how to do this. Apple's documentation on this subject is quite extensive (https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CertKeyTrustProgGuide/KeyRead.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001358-CH222-SW2), but still not what I need.
The function SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation gives a Data object that 
cannot be transformed to a String. The documentation says that it is a PCKS #1 response, but I can't work it out.
I've tried a lot of things, including below, but I can't get it to work.
func externalRepresentation(_ key: SecKey) -> String? {
    var error: Unmanaged<CFError>?

    guard let data = SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation(key, &error) as Data? else {
        return nil

Request
Is this even possible in Swift?
","The normal way to encode a binary blob, like a certificate or RSA key as a string is to use base64 encoding. You can convert a Data to base64 quite easily with the function base64EncodedString(options:). i.e.
let myString = myData.base64EncodedString()

whether that is exactly what you need for this application is hard to tell because your question doesn't give much context.
Looking at your screen shot, as well as the base64 encoded string, you need a header and footer. Most of the apparently random letters in the data structure are the base64 string (the JSON conversion has encoded the line feeds with \n and something else has doubled up the backslashes). Your last step is therefore to prepend the string with -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- and a new line, ad append a new line and -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
One more thing: you can get the original data back from the base64 string quite easily with Data.init?((base64Encoded base64String:,options:). i.e.
guard let myDataCopy = Data(base64Encoded: myString)
else { fatalError(""the string was not really base64"") }

","When one needs to encrypt longer plain text than a assymetric key typically random symmetric cipher block key is generated, for example, AES128 and then it is used to encrypt the data. At the end of a process symmetric key is encrypted with RSA public key and saved along with the cipher text.
A decryption consists of recovering symmetric key with a private RSA key and then using the former to decrypt the long message.
One of the reasons to do so is that RSA is much slower than, for example, AES. Another one is that block cipher has no limitation for a size of a message.

","I'm sorry that I'm writing an answer that contains basically the same information as divanov's answer, but an edit to add all the little details that I think are important would be a complete rewrite of the answer.
Generally you don't want to asymmetrically encrypt your data directly, but instead use RSA to exchange a symmetric key that is used to encrypt your data symmetrically. You can do it like this (idea taken from ""Cryptography Engineering"" by Ferguson, Kohno and Schneier, a book I can wholeheartedly recommend):

Assuming that l is the bit length of your modulus n, generate an l-1 bit long random number r.  Encrypt r with the RSA public key.
Use a cryptographic hash function to generate the symmetric key k out of r. I would advise the use of sha256: k=sha256(r)
Encrypt you data with a block cipher like AES256 using a proper ""mode"" like CBC.

The advantage of this procedure is that you do not have to care about RSA paddings at all (and there is a lot of stuff that can go wrong with them). Please don't check the structure of r after decrypting, though, and just stuff if into the hash function as you otherwise might open yourself up to padding oracle attacks (akin to this one) that are beyond the scope of my answer though.
Note that for a real world scenario you have to care about authenticity of the data, too. The only common use case where encryption is mostly enough is ""data at rest"", i.e. if no data is transmitted over the network and you only care about physical theft of your data.

","You should not implement crypto algorithms or key generation by yourself (not being an expert in cryptography). Where security matters, use mature and well-known libraries and tools.
On iOS it's worth checking out SecKey API (SecKeyEncrypt(_:_:_:_:_:_:) and so on). It was mentioned at WWDC 2016 Session 706 starting at 16:10.
You may find useful investigating the CryptoCompatibility example project which ""shows common cryptographic operations using Apple APIs.""
As a cross-platform solution you can use OpenSSL which also provides RSA API.

","The sudoers file is what you should have a look at. There's a lengthy tutorial here. In essence, it allows you to specify which users should have access to the sudo command via their username.
A short example would be to add the following line to sudoers:
%users ALL=(root) /usr/bin/find
This would means that any member of the group users with any hostname (ALL) can only run the find program as a root user. They will not be able to run rm or any other command not specified. In contrast, something like
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
which is one of the defaults, allows any member of the admin group on any hostname to execute any program (the last ALL) as any user (the ALL in parentheses).

I am trying to write a program which encrypts data using a RSA public

You don't need an OpenSSL library package to do this: you just need some of the crypto, encoding, and other packages in the Go standard library.  Namely:

encoding/pem
crypto/x509
math/rand
crypto/sha256
crypto/rsa
encoding/base64

Create a PEM block from the key, setting Type to ""RSA PRIVATE KEY"" or ""RSA PUBLIC KEY"", parse the keys with the x509 functions (PKIX for public), use a type assertion to make it the appropriate RSA public/private type, encrypt the message using OAEP padding, an SHA-256 hash function, and rand.Reader for a source of entropy, base64 encode the resulting cipher if you're sending it as text rather than binary, then base64 decode it and decrypt it using the same but with the private key on the other side.
See in particular func EncryptOAEP(hash hash.Hash, random io.Reader, pub *PublicKey, msg []byte, label []byte) ([]byte, error).
Read the documentation in these packages and some general info about encryption and RSA, there are also usage examples for each of these packages on StackOverflow -- though perhaps not put all together.
Every package you need for the described goal is in the Go standard library.
You may need to check that your PKCS function version (e.g. PKCS8) lines up with the private key produced by your OpenSSL version.

I generate the key pair with the following code:
OSStatus status = noErr;
NSMutableDictionary *privateKeyAttr = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
NSMutableDictionary *publicKeyAttr= [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
NSMutableDictionary *keyPairAttr = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];

NSData * publicTag = [NSData dataWithBytes:publicKeyIdentifier

NSData * privateTag = [NSData dataWithBytes:privateKeyIdentifier
                                     length:strlen((const char *)privateKeyIdentifier)];

SecKeyRef publicKey = NULL;
SecKeyRef privateKey = NULL;

[keyPairAttr setObject:(__bridge id)kSecAttrKeyTypeRSA
                forKey:(__bridge id)kSecAttrKeyType];
[keyPairAttr setObject:[NSNumber numberWithInt:2048]
                forKey:(__bridge id)kSecAttrKeySizeInBits];

[privateKeyAttr setObject:[NSNumber numberWithBool:YES]
                   forKey:(__bridge id)kSecAttrIsPermanent];
[privateKeyAttr setObject:privateTag
                   forKey:(__bridge id)kSecAttrApplicationTag];

[publicKeyAttr setObject:[NSNumber numberWithBool:YES]
                  forKey:(__bridge id)kSecAttrIsPermanent];
[publicKeyAttr setObject:publicTag
                  forKey:(__bridge id)kSecAttrApplicationTag];

[keyPairAttr setObject:privateKeyAttr
                forKey:(__bridge id)kSecPrivateKeyAttrs];
[keyPairAttr setObject:publicKeyAttr
                forKey:(__bridge id)kSecPublicKeyAttrs];

status = SecKeyGeneratePair((__bridge CFDictionaryRef)keyPairAttr,
                            &_publicKey, &_privateKey);

I then use the following code to obtain the raw data for the public key:
NSData* publicTag = [[NSData alloc] initWithBytes:publicKeyIdentifier length:sizeof(publicKeyIdentifier)];

OSStatus sanityCheck = noErr;
NSData* publicKeyBits = nil;

NSMutableDictionary* queryPublicKey = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
[queryPublicKey setObject:(__bridge id)kSecClassKey forKey:(__bridge id)kSecClass];
[queryPublicKey setObject:publicTag forKey:(__bridge id)kSecAttrApplicationTag];
[queryPublicKey setObject:(__bridge id)kSecAttrKeyTypeRSA forKey:(__bridge id)kSecAttrKeyType];

// Temporarily add key to the Keychain, return as data:
NSMutableDictionary* attributes = [queryPublicKey mutableCopy];
[attributes setObject:(__bridge id)key forKey:(__bridge id)kSecValueRef];
[attributes setObject:@YES forKey:(__bridge id)kSecReturnData];
CFTypeRef result;
sanityCheck = SecItemAdd((__bridge CFDictionaryRef)attributes, &result);
if (sanityCheck == errSecSuccess) {
    publicKeyBits = CFBridgingRelease(result);

    // Remove from Keychain again:
    (void)SecItemDelete((__bridge CFDictionaryRef)queryPublicKey);
}
return publicKeyBits;

The above code yields NSData of 270 bytes long for the public key; I base64 encode this data and send it to the device, but it is rejected.
My colleague at work has completed implementation of the same functionality for android, and he generates his key pair as follows:
    KeyPairGenerator kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"");
    kpg.initialize(2048);
    KeyPair key = kpg.generateKeyPair();

And he uses:
    key.getPublic().getEncoded() 

To access the public key data, which is 294 bytes long, and which the device accepts.
Also, if I take the raw bytes of his generated public key, and use my base64 encode and send, this is also accepted by the device.
What is the difference here? Why is his key 294 bytes, while mine is 270? And how can I fix this? Any help would be much appreciated.
EDIT
I have just found https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/14491/why-is-a-2048-bit-public-rsa-key-represented-by-540-hexadecimal-characters-in-x, that states:
Note that this does not count the encoding that says ""this is an RSA public key""; that takes up an additional 24 bytes (including overhead).
This sounds like what I need, although I don't know how to include this information.
Anyone?

Here's how I fixed it:
Install the EPEL repo
wget http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
rpm -ivh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

Install the cloud-init package
yum install cloud-init

Add a user to the box called ""cloud-user""
Add cloud-user to the sudoers file with the no password option
cloud-user  ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

Stop the instance, and create the AMI.
When you launch an instance from that AMI you can choose any key you want, and when you login you will just use the following command
ssh -i yourkeyfile.pem cloud-user@your.ip.addy

To become root, just type the following
sudo -i

This would be compatible to
$rsa = new Crypt_RSA();

algorithm.ImportPublicKey(publickKeyBytes, CryptographicPublicKeyBlobType.X509SubjectPublicKeyInfo);

The publicKeyBytes seems right. It works against another service that uses it to encrypt some data that I can succesfully decrypt. This issue is when i try to create some dummy encrypted data for unit testing.
Im running this code in a Portable Class Library using .Net Framework 4.5.
The above code throws at the line where it try's to decrypt, a System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicExceptionwith the following message:

The data to be decrypted exceeds the maximum for this modulus of 64
  bytes.

The following assert fails:
Assert.Equals(privateKey.KeySize, publicKey.KeySize)

Doing the following removeing the padded zero from the Modulus fix the public key and everything works fine.
RSAParameters rsaPublicParameters = publicKey.ExportParameters(false);
rsaPublicParameters.Modulus = rsaPublicParameters.Modulus.Skip(1).ToArray();
ICryptographicKey workingPublicKey = algorithm.ImportParameters(rsaPublicParameters);

","You say you're using Node.js version 10 but your link points to the documentation for Node.js version 11.  The documentation for version 10 is at https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/crypto.html
In version 11, the publicKeyEncoding and privateKeyEncoding properties of the options object passed as the second argument to crypto.generateKeyPairSync are optional.  In version 10 these properties are not optional, they must be specified.  Your program doesn't provide those properties, and that's why it's blowing up.
If you change:
const { privateKey, publicKey } = crypto.generateKeyPairSync('ec', {
  namedCurve: 'sect239k1'
});

to:
const { privateKey, publicKey } = crypto.generateKeyPairSync('ec', {
  namedCurve: 'sect239k1',
  publicKeyEncoding:  { type: 'spki', format: 'der' },
  privateKeyEncoding: { type: 'pkcs8', format: 'der' }
});

then your program should be much happier.

Update
OK, I installed Node 10 and ran your program.  sign.sign() is blowing up because, as stated in the documentation, it requires the private key to be in PEM format.  It can't handle a private key in the DER format my original answer produced.  The same applies to the format of the public key passed to verify.verify() -- it must be PEM, not DER.  So change this:
const { privateKey, publicKey } = crypto.generateKeyPairSync('ec', {
  namedCurve: 'sect239k1',
  publicKeyEncoding:  { type: 'spki', format: 'der' },
  privateKeyEncoding: { type: 'pkcs8', format: 'der' }
});

to this:
const { privateKey, publicKey } = crypto.generateKeyPairSync('ec', {
  namedCurve: 'sect239k1',
  publicKeyEncoding:  { type: 'spki', format: 'pem' },
  privateKeyEncoding: { type: 'pkcs8', format: 'pem' }
});

That is, change both occurrences of 'der' to 'pem'.
That will let your program run without throwing exceptions.  However, the verification attempt will fail and the reported result written by the final console.log() call will be false.  That's because the program does not tell verify.verify() the encoding that was used in the privateKey string.  To fix that and get a true result from the verification, change:
verify.verify(publicKey, signature)

to:
verify.verify(publicKey, signature, 'hex')

matching the string encoding that was specified when the signature was generated by sign.sign().  The documentation isn't very clear on this part, but from experimentation it seems that if the signature is a string then you must always specify the encoding of the string.  The only circumstance in which you can skip providing the encoding here is if you also skip it in the sign.sign() call, which would have caused signature to be generated as a Buffer rather than as a string.

I'm trying to encrypt a file using a public key generated through linux command line using the GnuPG command.
On my app I use Express, fs and Crypto to create a buffer from the file and get the public key content and then use publicEncrypt to get the encrypted data.
When I do so the application stops and throw an error complaining about the PEM format: bad base64 decode.

Here you have the main parts of this code:
var encryptStringWithRsaPublicKey = function(toEncrypt, relativeOrAbsolutePathToPublicKey) {
var absolutePath = path.resolve(relativeOrAbsolutePathToPublicKey);
var publicKey = fs.readFileSync(absolutePath, ""utf8"");
if(typeof toEncrypt !=='object') return false;
var buffer = new Buffer(toEncrypt);
console.log(publicKey);
var encrypted = crypto.publicEncrypt(publicKey, buffer);
return encrypted.toString(""base64"");

};
        fs.readFile(req.files[0].path, function (err, data){
            var encrypted = encryptStringWithRsaPublicKey(data, '/home/app/data/pub_key.txt');
            if(!encrypted) {

Maybe the Public Key has some end of line bad characters somewhere or maybe Crypto requires a very special format?

","I've found the solution to my problem.
In fact the method publicEncrypt is a wrapper of OpenSSL and then it expect a public/private key on that format. A key from GPG won't do it.
By generating the private and public keys with the following command the code work as expected:
$ openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
$ openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem

","
If yes, what is the procedure to that?

There's a lot to it. My routines span 3 source files, so I know I can't easily copy/paste something. The answer is arguably too broad.
As a starting point, you should start with this OpenSSL command to generate a self signed certificate:
openssl req -config example-com.conf -new -x509 -sha256 \
    -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout example-com.key.pem \
    -days 365 -out example-com.cert.pem

That OpenSSL command creates a new self signed certificate. If you omit the -x509 option, then you generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
Most options are self explanatory, The -nodes means ""no password on the private key"". The other unknown is -config example-com.conf, and you can find that at https://stackoverflow.com/a/26029695/608639.
Given you know the command and options, you should study the source code in <openssl src>/apps/req.c. Its the source code for the openssl req ... command. If you need the source code, you can download it from OpenSSL: Source, Tarballs.

This technique won't work with OpenSSL because the base64-encoded key structure is, ultimately, an SSH formatted key and OpenSSL doesn't support those. phpseclib, in contrast, does but not in the exact same format as your key. phpseclib expects the keys to be in the same format that they would be in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.

Should I verify the blob in first message or I should always skip that and do verification only during actual authentication message ?
I'm asking this because I have implemented my code like it does verification on both messages.

However i have debugged and found out OpenSSH is not sending same publickey blob in both message. so my question is why OpenSSH is doing so ? 
Is OpenSSH is properly following RFC then seems like i should skip verifying publickey blob in first message. if i do that , am i not breaking the RFC ? doing that is right or not ?
Please help me to resolve this query.

It is not clear what you mean ""verify"" for the first message,
but, for that message, sshd will just check if the given publickey blob exists in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.  If it exists in that file, ssh client will receive SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK .
> However i have debugged and found out OpenSSH is not sending same publickey

I had implemented a ssh client in Java from scratch, but I had not recognized such OpenSSH behaviors.

-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

I am using X509 encoding to encode the public key.  Here's the code to generate the ECDSA keys:
LibraryInitializer init;
AutoSeeded_RNG rng;
EC_Group ecGroup(""secp256k1"");
ECDSA_PrivateKey key(rng, ecGroup);

Why am I generating such similar public keys?  And am I right in assuming that isn't ""safe"" if multiple users were to use this code to generate their own keys?

UPDATE:
The answer below seems correct. I emailed the creator of XCA, Christian Hohnstaedt, to probe a little further into how XCA generates this public key and what it is. He replied that it is the EC_POINT and is obtained by using the command 
openssl ec -pubin -noout -text

Plugging in the X509 PEM encoded public keys indeed reveals different public EC Points.  It should be noted (for other newbs like me) that the public EC Points in the answer do no good for another party on their own - the other party needs to know which EC Group is being used, and that's why the X509 PEM encoding is much more helpful than just an EC Point.
","The actual public keys from these are:
02:77:83:04:A9:B8:B9:B2:9B:BF:48:71:83:38:64:87
4A:00:23:C5:8A:15:3B:35:1F:3F:D0:AB:29:7A:AB:1C
C3 

and
02:D4:2B:E4:13:D3:D3:8A:64:FD:1A:2B:EA:E2:06:46
A1:0A:78:1F:1D:C0:8B:5E:47:CA:7F:AF:E3:65:EE:1A
A5

These are not the same, so there is no apparent reason to worry on that front. The data that is the same is the key meta-data and encoding bumf (which you would expect to be the same for identical format keys).

Why is a random number generator (RNG) needed for EncryptorFilter/DecryptorFilter?

The signing and verification classes are abstract interfaces setup in cryptlib.h. Some cryptosystems use them, others do not. A class will specialize and can forgo using a generator. Sometimes a class does not need a generator for one of the operations. NullRNG can be used if not needed.
The reason RSA needs a RNG during public key operations is message padding. Padding is often part of the message formatting function. As @PuzzlePalace pointed out, OAEP padding is randomized and not deterministic.
The reason RSA needs a RNG during private key operations is blinding. For RSA and other RSA-like schemes (like Rabin-Williams), blinding is just a multiplication by a random value to mask the inversion by the priavte key to recover the original value. Later, after signing or decryption, the blinding value is removed and the result of the operation remains.
Related, a reason DSA or ECDSA would not need a RNG during private key operations is RFC 6979, Deterministic Usage of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Deterministic signatures don't use randomized formatting or randomized k's.
Another reason a RNG is needed for public key and private key operations is validation checks on the key. For example, a key might be checked to ensure a particular constraint holds, like its prime or it has a particular Jacobi symbol.


The RNG has to be the same for encryption/decryption, right? So, how to share between processes?

No, the generators can be different. The only requirements is they produce a random stream for some reasonable definition of what it means to be ""random"". Without splitting too many hairs, it means the generator produces a uniform distribution.
You can find more reading on Crypto++ generators at RandomNumberGenerator on the wiki.


If I use this code in a unit test with a global RNG, everything works fine.

One quick word of caution... GlobalRNG is part of the Test namespace. It is defined in test.cpp : 115:
NAMESPACE_BEGIN(CryptoPP)
NAMESPACE_BEGIN(Test)

ANONYMOUS_NAMESPACE_BEGIN
OFB_Mode<AES>::Encryption s_globalRNG;
NAMESPACE_END

RandomNumberGenerator & GlobalRNG()
{
    return dynamic_cast<RandomNumberGenerator&>(s_globalRNG);
}

NAMESPACE_END  // Test
NAMESPACE_END  // CryptoPP

GlobalRNG is a deterministic generator and its not part of the library proper. Your code will fail to compile in the field if you depend on it.
Use one of the other generators discussed at RandomNumberGenerator on the wiki. AutoSeededRandomPool is a good choice.


Using the NullRNG() as recommended by https://stackoverflow.com/users/608639/jww in Unable to do RSA
  Encrption/Decryption using Crypto++ (isValidCoding is false) leads to
std::exception NullRNG: NullRNG should only be passed to functions that don't need to generate random bytes.


That information is incorrect. I need to fix it. Thanks.

Interestingly (in a morbid sort of way), Crypto++ took CVE-2015-2141 due to blinding in Rabin-Williams. The blinding value needed to be a quadratic residue; otherwise an attacker could prepare special messages to reveal the private key.
The full paper by Evgeny Sidorov is available at Breaking the Rabin-Williams digital signature system implementation in the Crypto++ library. Here's what the new and improved inverse function looks like after fixing Sidorov's attack (from rw.cpp):
ModularArithmetic modn(m_n), modp(m_p), modq(m_q);
Integer r, rInv;

do
{
    // Do this in a loop for people using small numbers for testing
    r.Randomize(rng, Integer::One(), m_n - Integer::One());
    // Fix for CVE-2015-2141. Thanks to Evgeny Sidorov for reporting.
    // Squaring to satisfy Jacobi requirements suggested by Jean-Pierre Munch.
    r = modn.Square(r);
    rInv = modn.MultiplicativeInverse(r);
} while (rInv.IsZero());

If you read Section 6 of Sidorov's paper, he suggests generating a random r, and then checking the Jacobi symbol of r to ensure its a quadratic residue. If it was not a QR, then try a new random r. The triage used the method, but it showed the scheme slowed down considerably because a random r satisfies the condition with probability 1/16.
However, we knew squaring r ensured we satisfied Jacobi on the first try because r2 mod n was always a quadratic residue. The squaring/multiplication only takes log (exp) (not n log (n)), so it turned out to be a significant speedup over trial and error. Before we released the next version of the library, we switched to the squaring method.

The other thing is that I see the JceCMSEncryptorBuilder is takes an ASN1ObjectIdentifier. We're currently using doing something like this:
KeyGenerator cryptKeyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""AES"", ""BC"");
cryptKeyGenerator.init(256);
Key encryptionKey = cryptKeyGenerator.generateKey();
Cipher symmetricCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CTS/NoPadding"", ""BC"");
symmetricCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, encryptionKey, new IvParameterSpec(ivBytes));

and in the CMSAlgorithm class I don't see any CTS option. Am I missing something or is there a way to still use CTS? 
","
I only have an RSA public key for the recipient and not the whole X509Certificate

The KeyTransRecipientInfo structure of CMS EnvelopedData can use the SubjectKeyIdentifier value sometimes present in the X.509/PKIX certificate as an extension and Bouncy has an overloaded ctor for this case. Since you don't have the cert, you'll have to find out what method was used to calculate the value in the cert(s?) if the recipient(s) will use a cert, or try different guesses until you find one that works, or if you control the recipient(s) just choose some value(s) that it(they) will accept. 
org.bouncycastle.cert.X509ExtensionUtils and its two subclasses provide methods for computing the two standard schemes, but I find them no more convenient than doing it directly.

We're currently using ... AES/CTS/NoPadding ... and in the CMSAlgorithm class I don't see any CTS option

It's not just what's in CMSAlgorithm. There are two relevant factors:

any specific cipher (in JCA terms, transformation) used in CMS/PKCS7 EnvelopedData must be identified by an OID and conditionally parameters
the cipher used for a given message must be supported by the sender and the recipient or all recipients.

org.bouncycastle.cms.CMSAlgorithm is just a handy compendium of ciphers and some other things like keyagreements that both have standardized OIDs and are implemented by BC, which latter is actually controlled by org.bouncycastle.cms.jcajce.EnvelopedDataHelper or the bc-native equivalent which as you can see support only CBC mode for the supported block ciphers. (Both also support RC4 but as a stream cipher it does not use any mode. Plus RC4 is now very unpopular.) 
I don't recall ever seeing any standardized OID for a cipher in CTS mode. If that's right, you'd have to allocate one, and since no one else will implement that OID your messages will not be interoperable with anybody. If you can find a standard OID (or at least AlgId) that your peer(s) implement, for BC you'll have to create your own class conforming to (interface) OutputEncryptor, which isn't all that complicated if you look at the sources above given that you have either a provider or bc-native implementation of the underlying cipher.

In ConvertToPublicKey you export the XML, parse the XML, and turn it into byte arrays.  Why not just call ExportParameters(false) and extract the Modulus and Exponent byte arrays directly?

To sum their process up, to create a valid/authenticated API call:

Register for an account with them and generate a public/private key set. Then for each API call:
Obtain the UNIX epoch timestamp that the call is being made at.
Calculate the SHA-1 hash of your timestamp ""against"" your private key.
Make sure that your public key, private key and the calculated hash (above) is present as 3 separate HTTP parameters with every single API call.

What purpose does the timestamp and its derived SHA-1 hash serve? Why is it less secure to just require users send me their public/private keys with each API call?

","
What purpose does the timestamp and its derived SHA-1 hash serve? Why is it less secure to just require users send me their public/private keys with each API call?

To clear any misunderstanding you seem to have up front, the user should never send the private key over the network. The private key is to stay private. It is a secret shared between you and the user. Reread the Gengo link, you'll see that it is only used as a parameter to the HMAC function. It is up to the user to find a way to secure it, but your API does not need it to verify calls.
The timestamp serves two purposes. First it is a piece of data for which you will get both the plaintext and the HMAC. You will be recomputing the HMAC on your side with the private key of the user. If the HMAC checks, it means that not only the timestamp was not tampered with, but also that only someone knowing the private key could have sent it. It provides integrity and authenticity for that piece of data.
If it was a simple SHA1, a attacker could have intercepted the message, changed the timestamp, and recomputed the hash. By using a keyed hash, you ensure that the sender is who you think he is.
The second purpose for the timestamp is to prevent replay attacks. Even if using a keyed hash, the attacker could have captured an old request and send it again, possibly triggering unwanted actions. If your users hash the time and you test it and reject requests that are unreasonably old, you can prevent such replay attacks.  

Is this pubkey + privkey + hashed_timestamp method that Gengo is using a standardized practice for API auth? If so, does it have a name/algorithm? Are there other, equally-secure competitors to it?

Again the privkey is not sent through the pipe. Using HMAC for API authentication is quite common. It is used for Amazon Web Services for example. When used in the Gengo way, the fact that there is seemingly a public/private key pair can be confusing, it is really still symmetric cryptography, and the private key is used as a shared secret.
However I think it is better to include more than just the timestamp in the data that is HMAC'ed. Otherwise an attacker could tamper with other parts of the request. The headers, the HTTP verb, and a hash of the content of the request should be included as well.
Another scheme is to use the private key on client side to sign (encrypt with the private key) a piece of data, so the server only needs to verify it with the public key of the client and needs not know the private key of the client. Embedding a time information is still needed to prevent replays. I do not know much about this scheme, it might be hard to reliably link clients with a given public key in the first place.

What purpose does this
  HMAC serve and why does it require 3 arguments (SHA-1, the timestamp
  and the private key)?

An HMAC is a keyed hash. Consider the simplest form of message authentication: hash(key + message). It was found that this was not secure (see length extension attack) and a nested structure fixes the vulnerability. 
HMAC is a generic name of that structure: hash(k1 + hash(k2 + message)), where k1 and k2 are derived from the actual secret key. So when we do an HMAC we need to pass the name of the actual hash algorithm that will be used (here SHA-1), the message (here, the timestamp), and the secret key.

Finally, what do I do with the 3 parameters (pub key, priv key, hashed
  timestamp) on the server-side to perform authentication? If I was
  designing a system that only used the pub/priv keys, then I would
  treat them like a username/password combo and would check the database
  to see if that combo existed or not. But the hashed timestamp is
  really throwing me off here.

Hopefully clearer by now. You use the public key as an identifier to retrieve the private key. You take the ts header and recompute the HMAC of it with the private key. If it matches with the hmac header sent, the request is authentic. You check the actual timestamp to see if it's not an old request replayed by some attacker. If all checks, the call can go through. I think it's better to embed all the important information in the HMAC, not just a timestamp though.

","You need either public key cryptography or an HMAC, not both.
Let's come back to the timestamp later, and you're confusing authentication with integrity, which we'll also come back to later.
Authentication: in your case this is where the client proves knowledge of some secret to the server. Two common ways to do this are via public key cryptography and using an HMAC.

PKC: before using the service a public/private key pair is generated. The client has the private key; the server has the public key. Important: the private key never leaves the client. In particular, the server does not have access to the private key. To authenticate, the client encrypts some random value N (called a nonce), and sends N and its encrypted form to the server. The server uses the public key to decrypt the encrypted nonce and confirms that it equals the supplied nonce. This proves to the server that the client has the private key.
HMAC: client and server agree a shared secret K beforehand. To authenticate, the client creates a nonce N, computes HMAC(K, N), and sends N and HMAC(K, N) to the server. The server also computes HMAC(K, N) since it knows the shared secret and has received N from the client. If the computed and received HMAC(K, N) values are the same then the server knows that the client has the shared secret K.

The HMAC approach has one significant weakness compared with PKC: if the server is compromised then the attacked gains knowledge of K and can then use that to masquerade as the client.
If using PKC, ideally generate the keypair on the client and send the public key to the server. That way the server never has the private key.
However, unless the communication channel is confidential (e.g. uses SSL/TLS), both approaches have a problem: replay attacks. A passive observer can record the N+encrypted form, or N+HMAC(K,N) and replay them to the server. The server will then think that the observer is a valid client.
Two standard defences are:

Use a time-based nonce.
The server remembers previously-seen nonces, and rejects new requests that use a previously-seen nonce.

That's where the timestamp comes in, and is discussed in more detail here: Should I sign (with a public/private key) a form based authentication (no SSL)?
Integrity: we've proved to the server that we're a valid client, but we haven't provided any protection of the request itself. An attacker could modify our request in flight: we'd authenticate correctly but then execute the attacker's request rather than the client's original request.
To resolve this we need to protect the integrity of the request. We can do this with the same mechanism as above. Rather than just using a nonce (N) or nonce+timestamp, include the entire request in the data been encrypted or hashed. An important consideration here is that encrypted and hashing operate on bytes, not REST requests. You therefore need a reliable way to convert the REST request (i.e. HTTP method, URL, request parameters) into bytes. This is often called ""canonicalisation"": the client and server must both canonicalise the request in exactly the same way, so that they are encrypting/hashing the same bytes given the request.
This whole process is standardised in things like OAuth, e.g.  https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/authorizing-request
To answer your specific questions:

The timestamp defends against replay attacks: passive observers can't reply a client's session. The SHA-1 hash is used as a component of the HMAC.
Yes, to a point. But I'd use a fully-fledged implementation of it rather than rolling your own, such as something OAuth-based.
An HMAC is a keyed hash: it's like a standard cryptographic hash (such as SHA-1, except that you also include a shared secret key in the hash. Simply concatenating the key to the data being hashed has cryptographic weaknesses that the HMAC construct avoids. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC.)
If you're using PKC then you look up the client's public key on the server (based on some client ID, which ist not the client's private key), use that to decrypt the encrypted request, and verify that that request matches the received request. If you're using HMAC then you look up the client's shared secret, canonicalise the request, compute HMAC(K, R) and verify that it matches the received HMAC(K, R). In both cases you must also verify timestamps/nonces to protected against replays.

BUT: rule #1 of crypto: don't roll your own. Use an established mechanism, such as OAuth. You probably also want to use SSL/TLS, which would then also let you use client certificates as a third authentication option. If you used those then you could also rely on SSL/TLS to give you integrity and replay protection. However, implementing SSL/TLS certificate validation correctly seems to fox many developers...

","I assume that you want a function to input a four digit number: [0000 .. 9999] and produce a 15 character alphanumeric output.
You do not make it clear if this function is to be reversible.  If reversibility is not needed, then a one-way hash function will do what you want.  15 hex characters are 60 bits or 15 Base32 characters are 75 bits.  Use a larger size hash function, truncate and convert to hex or Base32.  Base32 gives a wider range of output characters than hex.
For reversibility you will need a Format Preserving Encryption, where the output size is limited to 60 or 75 significant bits.  For 60 bits, use DES as the base cipher as it has a 64 bit block size.  75 bits is more awkward.  AES, at 128 bits, has too large a block size so you might need to write a simple 76 bit Feistel cipher.  That will give you good obscurity, but only middling security.  You do not say how secure this function needs to be.

","Assumptions: ""integer maximum 6 length"" means 6 numeric characters 000000-999999.
Encrypt with a algorithm that has a 8-byte block size and then Base64 encode, that will produce 12 characters of output. 
Append 2 random bytes to the 6 characters of data to make 8-bytes, this will cause up to 2^16 or 65536 different results on encryption of the same value. Encrypt in ECB mode and Base64 encode. That will produce 12 characters of output.
To recover the input decode the Base64 encrypted to data, decrypt that and delete the 2 random bytes.
Possible encryption algorithm include Blowfish, XTEA, DES and others.
Note: For a larger range of different output the 6-digit number could first be converted to a binary representation of 3-bytes allowing 5 random bytes producing 2^40 different outputs for the same 6-digit input.

that WS has a method that returns the public key to use to encrypt the username and password of the user of the mobile application.
They give me a sample code written in php which simply calls the WS to obtain the public key and then calls openssl_public_encrypt with, as public key parameter, the value returned by the web service's call. This is an excerpt
function CallAPI($url, $data = false)
{
    $curl = curl_init();

    $url = sprintf(""%s?%s"", $url, http_build_query($data)); 

    curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_URL, $url);

$json = json_encode(array(""username""=>""********"",""psw""=>""*******""));
openssl_public_encrypt($json, $encrypted, $public_key);

From Windows Mobile point of view seems to be more complicated than this, also I am not really into RSA encryption.
the first thing I do is to call the WS to obtain the public key and I save it into a string. The following is the code I use to encrypt data.
ASCIIEncoding ByteConverter = new ASCIIEncoding();

byte[] dataToEncrypt = ByteConverter.GetBytes(data_string);
byte[] public_key = ByteConverter.GetBytes(public_key_string);
byte[] encryptedData;

RSAParameters key_info = RSA_provider.ExportParameters(false);

key_info.Modulus = public_key;

RSA_provider.ImportParameters(key_info);

encryptedData = RSA_provider.Encrypt(dataToEncrypt, false);
string encrypted_string = ByteConverter.GetString(encryptedData, 0, encryptedData.Length);

return encrypted_string;

If I try to send data to the web service it fails due to an authentication failure, also I noted that from php code that the encrypted string is always of 256 chars, while the .NET encrypted string has completely different length.

"20390762","Python Crypto RSA textbook encryption versus openssl - what is it doing?","I have an existing set of Python code that uses the primitive (textbook) RSA encryption mechanism to encrypt small pieces of data. Specifically, the python code loads a public key into variable publickey and then encrypts this data using the following code:
ciphertext = publickey.encrypt(plaintext,None)

Yes I have read the disclaimer that ""this function performs the plain, primitive RSA encryption (textbook). In real applications, you always need to use proper cryptographic padding,..."" Unfortunately, I cannot change this code at the present time, so I am stuck with using this ""textbook"" encrypt command.
Note that even though this command does not use any padding scheme, it still seems to be able to encrypt any (appropriately small) amount of plaintext. In other words, the plaintext can be any length up to whatever limit is imposed by RSA.
Now however, I want to use the OPENSSL C library in an IOS app to do an identical RSA encryption. I cannot figure out how to do the exact same thing that the python function is doing. OPENSSL has a method RSA_public_encrypt where you pass in the size of the plaintext, the plaintext itself, an RSA object pointer which contains public key information, and the RSA padding mechanism. To replicate what python is doing in the crypto library, I thought I could use RSA_NO_PADDING as the padding mechanism. The problem is that OPENSSL states in their documentation that if you use RSA_NO_PADDING, then the length of the plaintext to encrypt must be EXACTLY equal to a certain value: RSA_Size(rsa) where rsa is a pointer to the RSA object passed in (the object that contains the public key).
In other words, the python crypto library seems to be able to encrypt variable length plaintext with no padding, but OPENSSL requires plaintext to be fixed length. So what exactly is the python crypto library doing to handle the variable size of the plaintext, and is there any way I can replicate this in OPENSSL?
","If you look at the documentation for RSA_NO_PADDING, they explain:

This mode should only be used to implement cryptographically sound
  padding modes in the application code. Encrypting user data directly
  with RSA is insecure.

In other words, RSA_NO_PADDING is for cases where you're going to handle padding on your own, so OpenSSL expects an input of the proper size. It doesn't mean ""textbook RSA"". 
Is there a compelling reason you can't change the python code? Textbook RSA is insecure and you're taking a great risk by using it.

","Turns out both the pfx itself and the private key within the pfx were stored unencrypted.
I mistakenly thought the private key within the pfx was encrypted because 1.) I was told it was and 
2.) and because the openSSL package will not display the raw private key unless explicitly told to with the -nodes option
when openssl displays Enter PEM pass phrase: as it did above, it was asking for how to encrypt the displayed output: not how to decrypt the stored key, as I originally thought

problem I have with this is that the messages must be encrypted using asymmetric encryption
(public/private key). So the idea is that the API App sends encrypted messages using the public key 
to the Service Bus and later BizTalk polls the Service Bus and decrypts the messages with the private key.
Is it possible to do this?
","Data encryption is not something that is built into Service Bus, but you could definitely encrypt the data on your own using a .NET library. This is really easy if your messages are below the max size (256 KB for standard messaging and 1 mb for premium messaging). Just set the message body to be the resulting encrypted message.

Is it not possible to use curve ed25519 for both ECDH and ECDSA and have half the key size?
Is it not possible to use curve ed25519 for only ECDH?
I admit that I have a very limited understanding of ECC so the reason above may be because of security considerations but it is not easy to find any hint about this on the web!
NB: I understand that curve25519 can not be used for signing!

","I don't think you'll find anything better than the paper linked at Using same keypair for Diffie-Hellman and signing.
I suspect that this key reuse is fine as long as you're comfortable with assumption that SHA-512 (used in Ed25519 signing) and HSalsa (used as KDF with NaCl's Curve25519 based boxes) are independent hash functions (I do). But it'd be probably cleaner to use the same hash function with different prefixes.
I heard that Bernstein, Lange and Schwabe (authors of NaCl) are working on a paper about these issues, but who knows when it'll be published.

","You cannot sign an XML file with a public key, public keys are only for validation.
For signing you will need a private key, this key can be generated by OpenSSL. You can work on this for the moment and then you should ask to your client to merge your code with his keystore implementation. 
Once you are able to sign your file, you'll see the certificate in base64 format as part of the signed document, this certificate includes a public key which is used to validate the sign done by the private key.

Set the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and contents.

Now, on the machine, as root I can su - jenkins and become the jenkins user.  However, on a remote machine I cannot ssh with public key  to this machine (as the jenkins user with the respective keys).  
I created a new user on the machine via useradd, copied the jenkins ssh keys over to this account and was able to log in as this user using the keys.
I'm completely stumped with what is special about the jenkins user that could be blocking ssh public key access.  The only thing that sticks out in my mind is the jenkins user was 
created with User ID of 498.  Is there something blocking 'system' user from allowing ssh?
The end of the ssh command with -v enabled for failing login as user jenkins looks like this:

permission on the home directory of your jenkins user are not right (like not owned by user, or world or group-writableà
ssh not allowing key-based authentication for some users

There is no payment provider set up so sensitive Direct Debit information needs to be on a mySql server. This Direct Debit information needs to be human readable by users from accounting department.

Customer completes HTTPS encrypted form with an EV SSL certificate.
Data is stored in a separate database to the wordpress database.

Now part 4 is what bothers me... but it's ok at the moment, because only on the testing server!
","This is really difficult to answer, as it depends on how far you need to protect this data.
First step is obviously encrypting all details stored in mysql, incase someone gets a dump of your database.
This solution is good, but it introduces the vulnerability as if someone gets the decryption keys from your application server, they would be able to decrypt the dump of the database anyway.
There are many solutions to consider from here, i'm sure with some research you should be able to find some decent ones, but one way that comes to mind is:
You could encrypt the data on the application servers with a public/private key encryption algorithm. Public key can only be used to encrypt the information for storage, which lives on your application server. If that gets hacked, the only thing that they will be able to do is to add more data to your database =/. The private key in this case will be a password that would need to be entered every time a human needs to see this information.
This has the obvious disadvantage that you can't do any machine processing on your data, as its traveling completely encrypted all the way until its displayed.
(And you still have vulnerabilities of someone gaining access to your application server and simply dumping the session files/memcache where the key would have to be stored temporarily)
To be honest, first thing i'd do is encrypt the entire database one way or another. That alone adds a decent layer of protection. Dumping the database is easier than getting access to the file system of a server in most cases.

2) Someone can reverse engineer my app and understand how I interact with server webservices 
Use DexGuard, which can make reverse engineering even harder, like by encrypting strings
https://www.saikoa.com/dexguard
Proguard
“The ProGuard tool shrinks, optimizes, and obfuscates your code by removing unused code and renaming classes, fields, and methods with semantically obscure names. The result is a smaller sized .apk file that is more difficult to reverse engineer.”
When you create android project.
1. proguard.cfg file is automatically generated in the root directory of the project.
2. The default configuration file only covers general cases, so customize as per your needs.

Enable it
“Set the proguard.config  property in the /project.properties file. The path can be an absolute path or a path relative to the project’s root.”
 Case1:    Just add proguard.config=proguard.cfg if the proguard.cfg is in projects root path.
 Case2:    Configure from other location  [proguard.config=/path/to/proguard.cfg]

Remove the “#” (or uncomment) the proguard configuring statement in project.properties. Which will be in commented initially.
Customize it. try this link http://1belong2jesus.wordpress.com/

"27262955","How does the signature in a digital certificate come from?","According to here:
A digital certificate contains:

Serial Number: Used to uniquely identify the certificate.
Subject: The person, or entity identified.
Signature Algorithm: The algorithm used to create the signature.
Signature: The actual signature to verify that it came from the
issuer.
Issuer: The entity that verified the information and issued the
certificate.
Valid-From: The date the certificate is first valid from.
Valid-To: The expiration date.
Key-Usage: Purpose of the public key (e.g. encipherment, signature,
certificate signing...).
Public Key: The public key.
Thumbprint Algorithm: The algorithm used to hash the public key
certificate.
Thumbprint (also known as fingerprint): The hash itself, used as an
abbreviated form of the public key certificate.

My question is, how does the signature come from? I think it is used to ensure the digital certificate is issued by a trusted issuer. So the issuer use its private key to sign on something to produce the signature, then the verifier of the certificate must have the corresponding public key of the issuer to decipher the signature and verify that this something is genuine.
If I am correct, this something must be stored in the certificate as well for the verifier to compare the deciphered signature to. So what's this something? Could it be the thumbprint (hash) of the public key? 
","This something is most of the certificate itself. The receiver can calculate the hash over the TBSCertificate (the part of the certificate To Be Signed) itself using the algorithm in the certificate. The receiver can then verify that it is the same as the hash calculated by the signer (the issuer of the certificate). If the signature is verified and the signer is trusted, then the certificate is verified.
There are more tests to be performed such as validating that the certificate has not been revoked or over it's date of expiry before it can be fully trusted.  
A digital certificate consists of:

certificate information 
signature algorithm 
signature value

See the RFC 5280 for more info on the exact structure of the certificate.

        let signature = try clear.signed(with: privateKey, digestType: .sha256)
        print(signature.data)

        // making the signature string base64url encoded
        let finalSig = signature.base64String.replacingOccurrences(of: ""/"", with: ""_"")

        let encryptedData = try dataToEncrypt.encrypted(with: publicKey, padding: .PKCS1)
        let finalEncryptedData = encryptedData.base64String.replacingOccurrences(of: ""/"", with: ""_"")
        .replacingOccurrences(of: ""+"", with: ""-"")
        .replacingOccurrences(of: ""="", with: """")
        print(finalEncryptedData)

        // concatenate assertion
        jwtAssertion = encodedStuff + ""."" + finalEncryptedData
        print(""JWT Assertion: \(jwtAssertion)"")

        // decrypt to see if it works
        let recodedBase64 = base64urlToBase64(base64url: finalEncryptedData)
        let theEncrypted = try EncryptedMessage(base64Encoded: recodedBase64)
        let clearMessage = try theEncrypted.decrypted(with: privateKey, padding: .PKCS1)
        // decode decrypted message

        let finalDecrypted2 = Data(base64Encoded: finalDecrypted1)
        let finalDecrypted3 = String(data: finalDecrypted2!, encoding: .utf8)

    } catch let thisError {
        print(""An error has occurred!"",thisError)
    }

It turns out I have to use base64url for each, which is only a matter of replacing some characters with other, etc. So, everything looks good and still works on the jwt website, but when I send it using the code below I get this error message: 

{""error"":""invalid_grant"",""error_description"":""OpenSSL unable to verify data: error:0906D06C:PEM routines:PEM_read_bio:no start line""}

Password hashing and key derivation (sodium_crypto_pwhash_*)

Argon2i (the chosen algorithm of the Password Hashing Competition)
Scrypt

ECDH over Curve25519 (sodium_crypto_box)
Authenticated secret key encryption (sodium_crypto_secretbox)
Ed25519 digital signatures (sodium_crypto_sign)
AEAD Modes


ChaCha20-Poly1305
AES-256-GCM


One of the design principals of libsodium is that people don't know how to choose the best cryptographic primitive so libsodium chooses for you and doesn't let you choose for yourself.

","Public key encryption: An easy way to visualize this is as follows:
I send someone an unlocked box that they can put stuff in. Then they close it and it locks. They can ship me the box and I have the only key that will open the lock. 
The locked box is the public key encryption; the key is my private key. 
Symmetric key encryption works like this:
We buy a padlock at Home Depot and it comes with two keys. You take one and move to Boston; I take one and move to San Jose. We can padlock our box and ship it back and forth, only we have the keys.

Sender generates session symmetric key. 

Symmetric meaning both parties will use the same key.

Sender encrypts data with session key.
Sender requests receivers public key.
Receiver sends public key while keeping the matching private key secret.
Session key is encrypted using receivers pubic key. 

Now only the receivers private key can decrypt the session key.

Encrypted Data and encrypted session key are sent to receiver. 
Receiver decrypts senders session key using receivers secret private key.
Receiver decrypts data using decrypted session key.

Sticking with John Browne's metaphor:

I lock a document in a box with a key.
I ask a friend to send me a box to which only they have a key too. 
I place a copy of my document-box-key in my friends box and lock it. 
I send the document box and my friends box (which contains the key to the document box) to my friend.
My friend opens their box with their secret key, and retrieves the document-box-key from inside.
My friend then uses that key to open the document box.

","I think you're not instantiating the client correctly, accordingly with the doc for Named Clients.
You will need to receive the IHttpClientFactory in run-time and ask for your named client like this:
 var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient(""TestClient"");

About testing with Dependency Injection, I believe this Microsoft tutorial can help: Integration Tests Asp.Net Core. The deal here is, as the Startup.cs file and the Core Dependency Injector are part of the framework, you need to setup simulate the web application in the test context. And Microsoft provides the WebApplicationFactory for that. 
This example demonstrate a test with a httpClient given by the IHttpClientFactory in a simulated web application environment.

make: *** [sender-node.co] Error 1
Process returned error code 2

This is the part where i tired to call the functionprng_state* prng;
 prng_state* prng;
  rsa_key* key;
  int result = rsa_make_key(
    prng,
    0,
    rsa_get_size(key),
    65537,
    key);

I had also include the tomcrypt.h for the library in the code
#include ""../apps/libtomcrypt/src/headers/tomcrypt.h""

","I suppose that either tomcrypt.h or `tomcrypt_pk.h"" file gets included several times and that therefore the same things get defined several times.
To try out if this is the reason, I'd add the following lines at the top and at the end of tomcrypt.h, respectively.
At the top:
#ifndef _TOMCRYPT_H
#define _TOMCRYPT_H

At the end:
#endif

Repeat this for tomcat_pk.h:
#ifndef _TOMCRYPT_PK_H
#define _TOMCRYPT_PK_H
...
#endif

If the code then compiles, then the problem is that the same header file gets included (directly or indirectly) more than once in a compilation unit may also apply to other header files, e.g. tomcrypt_pk.h. So you could also check if you incude, for example, tomcrypt_pk.h directly in your .c-file, while another header file (e.g. tomcrypt.h) also includes this file.
If this is the case, you have two principal ways of solving the problem: (1) remove unnecessary include statements, (2) protect the include file from being interpreted more than once, e.g. by surrounding the definitions by #ifndef - #define-statements. I'd prefer option (1) over option (2).
Note that - as pointed out by StoryTeller - it is not encouraged to edit third party library files, even not for introducing such #ifndef-#define-statements. If you cannot manage to follow option (1), you could still surround the respective #include-statements in your files, e.g.
// in myFile.c:
#ifndef _TOMCRYPT_PK_H
#define _TOMCRYPT_PH_H
#include ""tomcrypt_pk.h""

"17799049","How to sign the soap body of a request on the client's side","I have built my Stub and other Web Service Facade classes via wscompile. The request can be built with no problems, but once it is sent off, the following error arises:
javax.xml.rpc.soap.SOAPFaultException: WSEC5061E: The SOAP Body is not signed.; null
at com.sun.xml.rpc.client.StreamingSender._raiseFault(StreamingSender.java:365)
at com.sun.xml.rpc.client.StreamingSender._send(StreamingSender.java:228)

The error clearly states that The SOAP Body is not signed. From my knowledge, this seems like I am doing something incorrect with setting the system properties. Below is what properties I have set:
System.setProperty(""javax.net.debug"",""ssl"");
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType"",""pkcs12"");
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.keyStore"",KeystorePath);
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword"",KeystorePassword);
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType"",""jks"");
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStore"",TrustStorePath);
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword"",TrustStorePassword);         

I have searched a bit about signing the body of a SOAP request with a public key or KeyStore but don't really know much about the topic, so I am probably searching for the wrong keywords.
If anyone could point me in the direction of any information or tutorials it would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks

Whenever I try to get a SecKeyRef to a public key in the iOS keychain and use it, I end up with a EXC_BAD_ACCESS error. The SecKeyRef (called ""publicKeyReference"" in my code below is initially set to NULL, but it should have a value after the SecItemCopyMatching method is called, which can be seen from the memory address in the debugger window.
Here's my code:
SecKeyRef publicKeyReference = NULL;
NSData* publicTag = [publicKeyIdentifier dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];


NSMutableDictionary *queryPublicKey = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];

// Set the public key query dictionary.
[queryPublicKey setObject:(__bridge id)kSecClassKey forKey:(__bridge id)kSecClass];

And Here's some screenshots of the error and the debug window:


It seems that something is being assigned to the SecKeyRef, since the value of the address isn't ""0x0"", but I've been continually getting the EXC_BAD_ACCESS error regardless of what I've tried. Any and all help is greatly appreciated on the issue.
","I got the same error with SecKeyCreateEncryptedData function (which is intended for replacing the usage of SecKeyEncrypt on iOS 10+ ), it is not caused by the SecKeyRef, but the CFDataRef which is the encrypted data.

The problem is that the database's (sqllite) only have the input of a byte array of 16bits. The open ssl method that I'm using creates around 600 - 1024 bits, so using that is impossible.
Any idea of what I could do to the public key to use this 16bit encryption technique?
Thanks in advance!
","Sounds like you're trying to use public / private key pairs when symmetric keys ought to be used.
I'd just generate a random string of 16 bytes and use that.  You can get it from /dev/urandom on Linux.
Public / private key pairs are longer because they have special requirements that regular symmetric algorithm keys don't.  The mudolo of an RSA key pair, for instance, needs to be a multiple of two primes, which excludes a lot of numbers / strings.  eg. 60000 isn't a multiple of just two primes - it's factorization shows that it's a multiple of 5^4 * 2^5 * 3.

"35580529","tweetnacl api and different key pairs","The tweetnacl library provides two functions to generate public and secret key pairs: crypto_box_keypair(pk,sk); and crypto_sign_keypair(pk,sk);:

The first function initializes key pairs which are intended to be used to
encrypt messages using the crypto_box(c,m,mlen,n,pk,sk); API and to
decrypt these later using the crypto_box_open(c,n,pk,sk) function.
Good example code seems to be hard to find.  Here is one for 
the library libsodium which is as tweetnacl based on NaCl.
The second function however initializes a keypair which can be used to 
sign a message using the crypto_sign(sm,&smlen,m,mlen,sk); API and 
later verify the signature using crypto_sign_open(m,&mlen,sm,smlen,pk);

While looking at the key generation code I figured out that in both cases the key generation starts with a 256 bit random number but yields different 
public keys in the end.  In fact the returned 512 bit signing sk key contains a copy of the public key pk in its so to say upper half.
I've looked through all documentation I could find which is not much.
Currently I've come to the conclusion that there is no proper way to use the same single key pair for both facilities.  Am I right?
","They are not the same kind of keypairs. The key generation for both may start with a 32-byte seed, but the relationship between the generated public and private keys in the two types of keypairs are different, so you cannot use them interchangeably. The fact that the private signing key contains its public key has no bearing on this matter.

Whatever I understood from there: private key sat at owner and owner send a encrypted data to some one along with public key. Public key decrypts that data at client side and also encrypt data of client sent to owner. Once the data is encrypted at client side by public key then the same public key can not reused to encrypt that data. Only the owner of the private key can encrypt and decrypt data as many as time.
Am I right whatever I understood?
My question is: how public key is travel from owner side to client side?
Every time the same public key will be sent from server end to client end or ever time the different public key will be send from server end to client end? 
@Ewan said as follows:

Client : Sends ""Hello""
Server : Here is my public key
Server : Please send your public key
Client : Here is my (encrypted with server public key)public key
Client : Here is an (encrypted with server public key)request
Server : Here is an (encrypted with client public key)response

This raises the following questions at said steps:

When first time client send Hello to server then how hello
will travel to server in encrypted way?
Do not understand why server find his public key?
Why server request client to send his public key?

","No you are wrong:

PersonA : creates public and private key pair
PersonA : Sends Public Key(A) to PersonB
PersonB : Encrypts data with Public Key(A)
PersonB : Sends encrypted Data to PersonA
PersonA : Decrypts encrypted Data with Private Key(A)

WCF can be setup to do multiple types of encryption and protocols but essentialy what i think you are asking boils down to
Handshake protocol:

Client : Sends ""Hello"" (not encrypted)
Server : Here is my public key (ServerPublicKEY = ""123"")
Server : Please send your public key
Client : Here is my public key (ClientPublicKEY = ""ABC"")
Client : Here is an (encrypted with ServerPublicKEY)request
Server : Decrypt with server private key and read
Server : Here is an (encrypted with ClientPublicKEY)response
Client : decrypt with client private key

to answer your additional questions
q1: ""When first time client send Hello to server then how hello will travel to server in encrypted way?""
a1: It is not encrypted
q2: ""Do not understand why server find his public key?""
a2: the server sends a public key so that the client can encrypt messages to send to the server
q3: ""Why server request client to send his public key?""
a3: The server needs the clients public key so it can encrypt messages to send to the client

Our project is written in codeigniter. The project owner is providing it to their customer. The owner is a business partner with that concept. Besides, the owner needs control of the project code so that the customer will not break rules with him like changing the code or moving it go another server or validity.
So the owner needs a system to enable disable the site. Let me give an example...
owner.com will have an admin panel where he can either disable or enable the client.com.
when he disables the client.com should display a custom message instead of loading the files.
client.com is written i a way that i will process requests from owner.com and also the other way round.
so, here i want a list of the concepts with which we can implement the ownership and control over client.com

","Since the app is written in php , i don't think there is any way you can secure it to one server alone since php is plain text anybody can modify the part of the code where you test if the key is valid or not ( not eaven if you test it on you're own server eg: when the app is runned you make a curl request to one of you're own servers and test if the key is valid or not , based on the response the app shuts down or continue to run , but as i sayd since this is plain php you can't make it work couse anybody can edit a few lines of code and make everithing run perfectly without any tests for a key at all ) , you could probably use some external binary file but again since the app code is plain text ... looking forward to see if there is any way of securing an php app to run on a server alone 
p.s. ah , forgot about hiphop php witch turns you're php project into a c ( or is it c++ ? ) program and that can be secured better , but i don't know how it handles large frameworks ...
Edit
HipHop-PHP if you can use it , you're app will turn from php into a binary program , this way nobody has access to you're php code + it will run faster than just plain php , worth a try
Update
Oki so as the last reply suggested , you can use ioncube or anyother php code encription , i did a fast test with ioncube evaluation , using this you need to load a php extension on the client side witch in some cases might not be viable since clients hosts may not allow this , you need to concider the environment in witch you're app will run and it should be as wide as possible ( eg. would anybody buy an app if they have to change they'r web hosting plan/company , to allow the ioncube php extenstion to be loaded ? ) , plus decripting a whole framework like codeigniter whont be fast witch in turn raises more problems eg. caching ...

Similarly crypto.ECDH.getPublicKey() is only the point (in conventional X9.62 format), not any PEM or DER format.
Moreover, DH and ECDH are not encryption algorithms, they are key-agreement (or secret-agreement) algorithms, and that operation is performed by DiffieHellman.computeSecret() or ECDH.computeSecret() respectively. Although not clearly documented, publicEncrypt actually calls OpenSSL's EVP_PKEY_encrypt{_init,} which doesn't support DH or ECDH, only RSA (with several choices of padding) and possibly GOST-wrap (I can't easily verify that and it may well be version dependent because upstream OpenSSL as of 1.1.0 a few years ago dropped the GOST algorithms).

","As Greg states in his comment, the randomness in the PKCS #1 padding will cause your encrypted result to vary each time.
Based on your use case, I would suggest you store a hash of the phone number alongside the encrypted data. You can then perform a quick lookup based on the hash. You may wish to salt your phone numbers prior to hashing.
Bear in mind that hashes are not guaranteed to be unique, so there is a teeny-tiny chance you'll get two hashes that clash.

I know there has to be a way to put all the NSStrings in one file and somehow parse it, although I'm not sure how to achieve this. Could it be done using a .plist file that contains all the encrypted strings?
This is an example of the code I use to decrypt my .txt file with one NSString:
NSString *filePath = @""/path/to/file.txt"";

    if ([[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:filePath]) {
        crypto = [[MyCrypto alloc] initWithPublicKey:publicKeyData privateKey:privateKeyData];

        }

NSLog(@""Decrypted: %@"", theString);

...


If someone can shed some light on the subject with an example I would truly appreciate it. 
","Make a for loop and put your decription code inside, furthermore modify the line
 theString = [NSString stringWithContentsOfFile:filePath encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:&err];

to the following (assuming i is the loop variable):
 theString = [array objectAtIndex:i];

Where you created array in the initialization part of your code, using:
NSArray *array = [NSArray arrayWithContentsOfFile:@""file.txt""];

The specified file also has to be a valid PLIST, an array being its root element. Example:
<plist>
<array>
    <string>alshnj369537nwlzba</string>
    <string>9ö876534tzhwjukmhnlfb</string>

The intended use of the certificate is code-signing of powershell scripts.
Because of the fact that the Provider is MS platform crypto provider the keys will be generated by the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Chip embedded in my motherboard.
The private key is thus now stored in the ""black-box"" TPM. So is there any need to wrap / password-protect the private key?
","Any key created by a TPM is already wrapped, either by:

The storage root key for TPM 1.2, or
One of the primary keys indicated as the key's parent for TPM 2

So the key is wrapped by one of the root keys at the time of creating the key, and there is nothing special you have to do to make it happen. In fact, you cannot make it not happen.
The root keys themselves are guaranteed by the TPM spec to never leave the TPM. If you want to guarantee that your newly generated key will never leave the TPM either, make it non-migrateable. 
In addition, you can also make any of the aforementioned keys password-protected. Whether or not you do that depends on your specific requirements. Keep in mind however that the TPM spec is not focused on protecting against physical attacks, so if you lose physical access to your machine you should probably consider it compromised.

"23649173","Prevent use of my API by authenticated clients (PGP/GPG maybe?)","I have a mobile app (Android) that makes tens of thousands of RESTful webservice requests to my server (per day of course).
For a variety of reasons, specifically the fact that my server has limited resources (both in hardware specs as well as in the form of pricey licensed content which is sent to my app via the API responses), I would like to ensure that only my apps are able to make successful API requests to my webservice.
I do know it's at least theoretically possible to do this, at least for Android-based systems because Google has a method to verify backend calls from Android on a trusted 3rd-party server (e.g., your API server). I believe it's based on OAuth and is tied to the requisite Google account that every Android device must have been setup with.
I actually ended up implementing this, but abandoned it after about a month as it needed the GoogleAuthUtil mechanism only provided in the most recent version of Google Play Services which had to be installed on the user's device (and of course this prevented most of my users from upgrading). Another problem is that multiple Google accounts can be on a device, so I'd either have to guess which was the right one, or worse, prompt/annoy the user to choose; these options were absolutely out of the question.
My initial thought on the matter is to use some kind of public key encryption, such as PGP/GPG. Include my API's public key in the app (with the understanding that it's not meant to be secure -- it's a PUBLIC key after all), and then in addition to what I already do to sign my API requests I could encrypt the entire contents using the API's public key.
A few days later (today) I finally got the time to sit down and hash out the design and implementation details, and it quickly dawned on me (as well as Robert below in the comments) that because the API's public key as well as the other signature related logic could theoretically be extracted, a successful hacker could then quite easily generate ""genuine"" API requests that my API server would decrypt with its private key and be none the wiser.
I did come across these two questions posted on programmers.stackexchange that have some really good answers on the subject by people much smarter than me:

https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/219028/how-to-safeguard-a-rest-api-for-only-trusted-mobile-applications
https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/220080/is-it-possible-to-check-a-client-side-application-identity-from-server-side

From what I have gathered, I'm willing to say that yes it's theoretically possible (just look at Google's GoogleAuthUtil OAuth-based backend verification system that I linked to above). However, it's incredibly painful to correctly implement/maintain, so unless your API is serving nuclear launch codes it's probably wise just to obfuscate the requests as best you can to prevent 90% of the cheaters.
If a mod wants to remove this question or mark it as a duplicate please feel free. OTOH, if someone comes along wondering the same thing maybe this will help them -- I never thought to ask this on programmers.stackexchange, but most of my leads were found in those questions. And of course in the unlikely scenario that a security guru sees this and can explain how this can be done relatively easily and effectively well that would be great too. ;)
","Why not generate on client side public/private keys and use the server public key to send the client private one to the server. Store client private key on server side with some kind of request identifier, and further requests could be crypted with client public key, in order to send user credential (is there any on your server?) for example.
Requests could however come from any kind of client aware of your interface, but at least that requests comes from users with valid credentials, otherwise they would fail (still have to got resources to handle wrong request).
Does this makes sens? I'm really new to this subject, but I also have read tons of articles without coming accross to really well defined solution.

To keep it small and easy to portable to different platforms I did not want to link against OpenSSL or Crypto++. I found that as a part of the axTLS project which has a suitable license and an easy to extract RSA algorithm. The rsa function for encryption needs two components (as it usses the public key). The pup_exp is 65537 and modulus is the public part of the key and priv_exp the private one.

    )

For easy use for the user, I want to load a certificate like X.509 or PEM generated by a library like OpenSSL, but in C or C++ code without including the whole OpenSSL stuff. But at the moment I even did not find an understandable documentation of the common key file formats. 
","There are two types of RSA public key format widely used and they are PKCS#1 and X.509(SubjectPublicKeyInfo).

Data encrypted using public key can be decrypted using same public key?

No. That would defeat the purpose, because everyone knows the public key.

Data encrypted using private key can be decrypted using same private key?

No. That would defeat the purpose, because then you cannot send anyone an encrypted message (without knowing their private key, which by definition you don't).
Symmetric cryptography does work this way, though. There is only a single secret key, that you can use to encrypt your files before you put them on Dropbox, or that you can share with your friend to send messages that only the two of you can read. 
Also, in some public key systems, it is possible to derive the public key from the private key (not the other way around, of course). But this does not really change the principle (because the public key is known to the owner of the private key anyway).

This property is same for other public key algorithms too?

The definition of public key cryptography is that there is a key pair, consisting of a private half and a public half, one of them being used to create the message, the other to read them.

Q: Are public key and private key generated using same algorithm ?

Generally speaking they are not generated using the same algorithm. For RSA they could have been generated identically, but most cryptography libraries use a known public exponent. This means that if the private key is known that it is easy to deduce the public key. In many key formats the public key is included with the private key or can be calculated easily from the information in the private key format.
Note that it is theoretically possible to generate a key pair where the public exponent has as much entropy as the private exponent. Some HSM's do allow such an operation.
All in all you cannot switch keys without sacrificing security for encryption purposes.

Q: Can a message that encrypted by private key decrypts by public key ?

In theory this could be the case if your cryptographic library allows it. Most libraries do not allow this however. First of all, as described above, it is not a secure operation. Furthermore, many libraries will assume that anything encrypted with a private key should use the padding mode for digital signature generation. In that case decryption is likely to fail; if it doesn't your ciphertext is not secure - so that's probably worse.
From the PKCS#1 specification:


The main mathematical operation in each primitive is exponentiation,
  as in the encryption and decryption primitives of Section 5.1. RSASP1
  and RSAVP1 are the same as RSADP and RSAEP except for the names of
  their input and output arguments; they are distinguished as they are
  intended for different purposes.


The padding mechanism that is applied before the primitive differs significantly for  encryption and signature generation.

Q: Can a message that encrypted by public key decrypts by private key?

That is the underlying idea of asymmetrical encryption. That means ""yes"".

In practice, trying to put an instance of SecretKeyEntry causes an exception.
I suggest putting two entries in the keystore. 

KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry that you can instantiate given a PrivateKey (generated from the modulus and the private exponent using RSAPrivateKeySpec in conjunction with KeyFactory)
KeyStore.TrustedCertificateEntry with your self signed certificate, which you would have to pre-generate using java keytool and load at runtime from assets. It is not supposed to be secret by definition.

","Future readers, please prove me wrong (and post your own answer).
Given it is pretty new (November 2013) there probably aren't any implementations at all. Even the authors of the paper might not have implemented it themselves (you could ask them though). But as far as I can tell the protocol only uses operations that would have to be included in NTRUEncrypt implementations anyway. So it shouldn't be to difficult to write one yourself on top of an existing NTRU library. You can ask specific questions on the protocol here or on https://crypto.stackexchange.com.

In all examples I've seen, the certificate authority's public key is used to authenticate a connection. But it seems unnecessary. If my library talks only to google.com, can I obtain and save google.com public key over secure channel (a browser) and then use this key directly to establish authenticated connections without using CA key again? 
","You need to use the server's key pair, not the CA. When establishing an HTTPS connection, data will be encrypted under the public key that gets presented. In order to decrypt that data, the server will need access to the corresponding private key, and it would be really bad if you had the CA's private key sitting around. 
The purpose of the CA is so the client can validate the server's certificate through some trusted 3rd party. Your client will need the CA certificate to correctly authenticate the server, but presumably will already have and trust that CA. 
Edit based on your comment:
There are more advantages to shipping the CA certificate instead of just the server certificate. 
The primary reason is that in the event there is ever a compromise of the server's private key, you don't need to distribute new certificates to all your clients. Since the CA should be better protected than your server, the CA can simply issue a new certificate, which clients will trust without any extra work. 
If you shipped your server's certificate, you'd need a way to securely update the certificate on every client.

"23643545","RSA BadPaddingException when decrypting","I am encrypting some bytes of data On a java smart card using a public key I generated on a desktop app, but when I try to decrypt the data on my desktop I get the BadPaddingException :  Data must start with zero, I read that this might be caused by the use of a false private key to decrypt the data.

First, I generated a public/private key pair on a desktop app and loaded them on the smart card using the following code (being generated in BigInteger type, I converted them to hexadecimal, and from hexa decimal to a byte array):
void keyGen(String ID)throws Exception{
    // where ID is the name of the user 
    KeyPairGenerator kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"");
    kpg.initialize(512);
    KeyPair kp = kpg.genKeyPair();
    this.pubKey = (RSAPublicKey) kp.getPublic();
    this.privKey = (RSAPrivateKey) kp.getPrivate();

    KeyFactory fact = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
    this.pub = fact.getKeySpec(kp.getPublic(), RSAPublicKeySpec.class);
    this.priv = fact.getKeySpec(kp.getPrivate(),  RSAPrivateKeySpec.class);

    saveToFile(ID+"".pub"", pub.getModulus(),  pub.getPublicExponent());
    saveToFile(ID+"".priv"", priv.getModulus(),  priv.getPrivateExponent());

}


here is the savetofile function:
    public void saveToFile(String fileName,  BigInteger mod, BigInteger exp) throws IOException {
          ObjectOutputStream oout = new ObjectOutputStream(
            new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(fileName)));
          try {
            oout.writeObject(mod);
            oout.writeObject(exp);
          } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new IOException();
          } finally {
            oout.close();
          }
        }

This is the line used to store the public key on the smart card:
Main.sRmi.setPub(Crypto.hexStringToByteArray(Main.crypto.getPubMod().toString(16)), 
 toByteArray(""0""+Main.crypto.getPubexp().toString(16)));

(The zero is added to the string because we cannot convert a string of odd hexadecimals into bytes)

Then I try to encrypt the data using that public key inside the card, and this is the function I'm using:
private Cipher cipherRSA = Cipher.getInstance(Cipher.ALG_RSA_PKCS1, false);
private byte[] cipherText = new byte[64];

public byte[] encrypt(byte[] clearText){

    cipherRSA.init(rsa_PublicKey, Cipher.MODE_ENCRYPT);
    cipherRSA.doFinal(clearText, (short)0,  (short)clearText.length,cipherText, (short)0 );
    return cipherText;
}

Then I try to get this encrypted value on another desktop application, and decrypt it using the private key I'm reading from the file:

This is how I read the private key from the file:
public void init (String ID ) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException, Exception{

    Object o[] = openFile(ID+"".pub"");
    setPubMod((BigInteger) o[0]);
    setPubexp((BigInteger) o[1]);
    RSAPublicKeySpec keySpec = new RSAPublicKeySpec(this.pubMod, this.pubexp);
    KeyFactory fact = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
    pubKey = (RSAPublicKey) fact.generatePublic(keySpec);
    o = openFile(ID+"".priv"");
    setPrivMod((BigInteger) o[0]);
    setPrivexp((BigInteger) o[1]);
    RSAPrivateKeySpec keySpec1 = new RSAPrivateKeySpec(this.privMod, this.privexp);
    fact = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
    privKey = (RSAPrivateKey) fact.generatePrivate(keySpec1);
    cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/ECB/PKCS1PADDING""); 
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, pubKey);
}

After getting the private key in the BigInteger Variable, I decrypt using the following method:
public byte[] rsaDecrypt(byte[] data) throws Exception, BadPaddingException {

      Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");
      cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, privKey);
      byte[] clearData = cipher.doFinal(data);
      return clearData;
    }

To sum it all up, I create a key pair in BigInteger Format, I save the BigInteger Variable into a Serialized array of two BigIntegers to be used by the other desktop App, then I convert them into Hexa String, then into an array of bytes which i put inside the smart card.
Can anyone please tell me what's wrong with this procedure? Is it too much? Is there a better way to do so?

I think I know where the problem is, it's with the key stored inside the smart card, converting it the way I did obviously is not working, seeing how I read it from the card and printed it out and got a completely different result, so the question is now, how do I export successfully a public key created on java.crypto (in BigInteger) to the Smart card where public keys are stored in Bytes?
I found this:
Sets the public exponent value of the key. The plaintext data format is big-endian and right-aligned (the least significant bit is the least significant bit of last byte). Input exponent data is copied into the internal representation. 
so how can I convert a big integer to this big-endian byte format?
Now I'm trying to set the public key, here is the code i'm executing for that:
public void setPub(byte[] expo,byte[] mod){
    rsa_PublicKey.clearKey();
    rsa_PublicKey.setExponent(expo, (short)0, (short)expo.length);
    rsa_PublicKey.setModulus(mod, (short)0, (short)mod.length);
}

where expo is a 65 byte array and mod is a 3 byte array generated by a key gen, but I'm getting this error :

"31104143","How are digital signatures useful?","As per my understanding, if A and B want to talk and X is the man in the middle,  then X can just delete B's public key and make A believe that X's public key is actually B's public key. Now whenever A asks for a digital signature from B, the message will actually go to X. X will use his private key to sign the digest, which then A will decrypt using X's public key, thinking that it was B who signed it.
This is a typical man in the middle attack scenario, and there does not seem a clear solution as to how Digital Signatures can be helpful in this case.
My question:1) Is there some way that A and B can communicate even if they have X in the middle.
2) If not, then why are digital signatures useful(under what assumptions). An assumption can be as simple as:: X can only look at the public keys but not modify them(X cannot turn B's public key to X's public key). 
","Say A is Alice and B is her Bank. The bank gets a public key certificate signed by a trusted authority whose key Alice already knows. The certificate proves that a certain public key actually belongs to that bank. When Alice tries to connect to her bank, if Xavier tries to switch the bank's key for his own, Alice won't trust Xavier's key, because it isn't certified as belonging to the bank. If Xavier tries to replace Alice, he won't be able to log in as Alice. He doesn't have her password, and he can't get it, because he can't successfully pose as her bank.

I plan to use asymetric crypto so as to send a message from 1 server (the licence server) to n clients (the n computers on which the software is installed)

The client sends (via mail, for example) some informations about the computer (MAC address, machine name, you name it)
On the licence server, these informations are encrypted using a well secured public (not so public) RSA key, this encrypted payload is the licence.
the encrypted licence is sent to the client
When the software is launched, it cheks for a licence file, it is able to ensure the payload was encrypted with the server key, using the corresponding RSA private key, shipped with each version of the software.
Once the licence decrypted, the software checks it's running on the same machine the licence was given to. 
In my opinion, no one will be able to forge an encrypted payload without access to the Licence server RSA key.

Of course, the licence might be stolen, then the software launched in a virtual machine which mimics a genuine client machine, or the software might be disassembled so as to unplug the licence check.
But is this scheme good enough, or am I utterly naive in this regard?
Thanks
","It's a decent scheme, although are you sure you want the client to have the private key and the server the public key? Unless you're generating one keypair per install, shouldn't it be the other way around?
The scheme is simple, but is it practical? If your goal is to prevent casual cracking of your application there are simpler solutions that are just as effective. And if your goal is to prevent crackers from running your application, chances are that (a) you won't succeed and (b) your program isn't important enough to merit such attention.
And why would someone seek to attack the cryptography part of the license scheme when simply hex-editing the binary to change the license checking code to NOPs will almost certainly work just fine?
I'd rethink the licensing strategy and its importance to your product and its success if I were you.

"5755157","SSL certificate strategy for untrusted server","I'm developing a product that needs to act as a server over a local network for other client applications to connect to, under the following constraints:

The data exchanged is very valuable, and we have no guarantee over the security of the users' network or the machine acting as a server. Therefore any SSL certificate could potentially fall into ""the wrong hands"".
To minimise disruption to the user experience, any non-electronic means of identifying the server to the client should be limited to information that can be written on a post-it (i.e. IP address, passcode rather than exchanging key files).

Given these, our current SSL strategy is:

Do not install any SSL certificates into any trusted stores or sign any certificates against a CA certificate - this could give a potential attacker a front-door key to all the client machines
SSL certificates will therefore be self-signed. This offers no man in the middle protection, because we have no way of verifying the server. It does however offer eavesdropping protection to those users who have insecure networks but secure servers.
Implement a ""passcode"" system over the top using Rijndael symmetric encryption, so even if the certificate is compromised there is some eaves-dropping protection (I know, many leaky buckets - but better than nothing). This passcode can be regularly regenerated with minimal interruption to the user experience of the clients.

Within these constraints, is there a more secure strategy for the client and server to communicate?
","In the end we developed a system where we could generate a new SSL certificate in memory for each channel we were going to support. This cannot provide protection against Man in the Middle but does at least protect against eavesdropping (unless the third party has access to the memory of the server at time of transmission, in which case all security is moot anyway!).

I need to way to determine if a request on my server came from an iPhone (or any mobile device running the app I wrote for that matter). Basically, I only want to allow apps that I wrote to communicate with the server and need a way to verify that. Since I'm writing the apps, I can modify the headers and what not any way I need to.
I read up a little on Public Key Encryption, but I don't think it'd work. If I sent some sort of secret hashed word in my headers to verify it, couldn't some outside party simply get those headers and use the same ones in their request?

","If your byte arrays, converted from hex in the file, are big-endian as is conventional, to convert a positive big-endian byte array to BigInteger look at the javadoc for BigInteger for the constructor that takes an int sign for positive and a big-endian byte array for magnitude.
'Textbook' (unpadded) RSA is insecure; see crypto.SX security.SX and wikipedia. Using RSA for data larger than one block the way you've coded it will semi-randomly fail, and if you correct that, what amounts to ECB mode is inefficient and insecure; see crypto.SX security.SX and wikipedia. Using an unauthenticated public key is usually insecure.
If you are doing this for fun because it makes you feel like a ""l33t hack5r"" or Bond supervillain, and don't care about actual securty, this is fine. If you need or want actual security, drop this and use programs written by people who know what they are doing, and/or search 'don't roll your own crypto'.

","Here is the answer I have received but haven't tested yet, I'm not going to mark it as the answer until I have tested exactly what it does.
The answer is this django project, it's for leaking websites, it reads the entire file into memory and then encrypts it.
http://gitorious.org/deaddrop/deaddrop/blobs/master/drop/views.py
There is however a way to chunk the data
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/http/file-uploads/
There is also a problem that the httpd is handling the file upload and can ignore the application framework depending... so I need to test it out a lot before I'm sure what it's doing. 
However that said I'm pretty sure you can do it with wsgi which I'm pretty sure that django does when you use mod_wsgi with apache... not sure what other web servers use and I'd prefer to use something more light weight.
edit: if someone does happen to test this out rigorously, and posts it as an answer I'll mark that as the answer.

I am currently having two issues relating to security:
1) What is a good way to secure the data for transmission over NFC? I'm thinking public key encryption so that it can be encrypted on the phone using the public key and then decrypted by the .NET on the other side using the private key.
2) How to secure the data so that the data can't be cloned by another reader i.e. another reader pretends the be the windows client and reads the secure data. This could then be played back to the windows client by the attacker at a later data to make a payment. I'm thinking that when the phone taps the client reader the client will send a token that must be present in the data returned from the phone that includes the sensitive data. I think that maybe the public and private keys should be created per each transaction request. The public key sent to the phone to encrypt the data. Maybe that would suffice as the token also as if it can't be decrypted by the client then it's an invalid request.
Please note that I have no experience in cryptography at all. I'm aiming to implement a solution that has libraries readily available in .NET 3.0 and BlackBerry SDK 7.0.

Imagine a supermarket. Every single shelf is independently stockable. There are a hundred shelf stackers, each of whom stack a number of shelves. These stackers have managers, who can overview the shelves of all of their subordinates. These stock managers have section managers possibly having complex relationships, such as manager A being able to see a subset of manager B's shelves. There are a few store managers who can see everything.

I don't think the scalability problem comes from using public-key crypto. It rather comes from the complexity in your requirement (wanting to have so many configurable groups).
If you are going to send out the same encrypted message to hundreds of parties, and there can be an arbitrary subset of them that are supposed to read it, and you want to be able modify these permissions later, you need to give everyone his own key-pair.
You would then send out the message encrypted symmetrically (with a random session key) along with copies of the session key encrypted for all recipients.
If you see that very often you address the exact same subset, you may extend the validity of those session keys to span multiple messages. Then you do not need to transmit all the keys every time (you should still expire them after some time, though).

None of the shelf stackers, stock managers, section managers or store managers would have any kind of clue about public/private key cryptography

Well, their software/device would handle that.

","Here's a way that requires n key exchanges, but keeps the messages themselves as small as for two-party communication.
Assuming that the general form of your problem is:

There are n parties, numbered p_1 through p_n
Messages have a security level m, such that only parties p_1 to p_m can decrypt the message.

You can use this key exchange step:

Generate n AES keys, numbered k_1 to k_n.
Securely give each key k_i to all parties p_1 to p_i.

Then to send a message with security level m, just encrypt it with the key k_m.
One side-effect of this scheme is that party p_b does not have the ability to prevent party p_a from decrypting messages they send if a < b. Hopefully that's okay.

"6491916","Complex encryption/decryption model - is this even possible?","Suppose I have a server which is publishing information (e.g. via a message bus) to four parties: A, B, C and D. All traffic can be discovered in encrypted form by any party. In order to make use of the information, obviously it would need to be decrypted:

Party A should be able to read all information (i.e. decrypt information intended for A, B and C)
Party B should be able to read information intended for B and C
Party C should only be able to read information intended for party C
Party D should be able to read information for B and D

Obviously this could be achieved by having completely separate public/private key pairs for each party and then sharing the private keys as per the requirements above. Unfortunately this does not scale nicely to hundreds of parties.
Is there a better way? 

EDIT
Basically, what I would like to do is for each person to have their private key and for me to say, when encrypting a message, that it is encrypted with key = A | B | C such that this means that a person with any of key A, B or C can decrypt it. Imagine a trunk which can have n locks fitted to it, any of which can open the trunk.
","What you want can be achieved using normal protocols based on public key cryptography.  The Bouncy Castle Crypto APIs has support for both OpenPGP and CMS, either of which can work from Scala.
TO set everything up:

Every party is given a public/private key pair.

No one EVER shares the private key.  The private key must stay private

Every party knows every other party's public key

The protocols allow encryption using multiple public keys.  For example, if you use something like the PGPEncryptedDataGenerator, then you would call the addMethod(PGPPublicKey) method for every recipient you wish to be able to decrypt the message.
There are a lot of nuances to the API's, but the unit tests and examples will really help you navigate them.
Implementation Details
Both protocols work in fundamentally the same way.

Securely generate a random symmetric key
For every recipient, encrypt the symmetric key with the recipient's public key.  All of the encrypted public keys are written into a message header.
Encrypt the message using the symmetric key.  This becomes the message content.

Recipients reverse the process to decrypt the message

Search message header for key addressed to self.
Use private key to decrypt symmetric key.
Use symmetric key to decrypt the message content.

","They're the same thing, but Android prints it out in base 16 (hexadecimal) whereas your desktop's Java is printing it in base 10 (decimal). You'll see variations of the output of toString() between different implementations.
For instance, look at the public exponent and note that hex 0x10001 is equal to decimal 65537. This exponent is commonly known as RSA F4. However as this public exponent is used for a lot of keys, you cannot use it to distinguish between keys.

It is clear that the key was changed because there is a word ""1024 bits"" appear in the key and the number of modulas is not the same as well
How can I manage this problem. I'd like a professional to help me please 
","That does look like a different key. Please try again as you've probably send an old key or something. Make sure you don't regenerate the key pair, it will be different each time. Use the private key to print out the modulus as BigInteger instead; BigInteger instances will always print out as decimals making for an easier comparison. Or even better, use BigInteger.toString(16) to get a hexadecimal representation.
If you use a good random number generator (like the default one in Java) then the modulus should be unique for the key pair. Therefore it, or the SHA1 hash over the modulus is normally used to identify the key.

","Your first block differs as you use different IV in the decrypt. In IOS decryptBase64String(..) don't take an IV as input, which triggers it to be initialized to all 0'es. In C# you initializes it to the same value as the key. 
In general the IV need to be a random value generated at encryption time, and passed along with the encrypted data. Often it's prepended the encrypted data, so you easily can get it when you initializes your decryption library. Using all 0'es as IV is bad practice .. and the same goes for using the key as IV.

"17042887","Secure asymmetric key implementation client-side","I'm currently trying to develop a client-server structure, with the client being in .NET and the server being a PHP based SOAP server.
Now, I'm trying to implement an asymmetric key system using Rijndael 256 and a bit of fiddling about. I understand the basic concept of a public/private key pair (as per this page & Wikipedia), however I cannot get my head around it being secure in any client-side environment.
In short, the software will be running on the client machine, so the user will have the ability to tamper with the software. Most of the client's functionality revolves around responses received from the server in order to display reports & details. Along with that the client software will occasionally await a command from the server, where the server will tell the client to show a pop-up or execute a client-program shutdown (to do with licensing). I realise the server may crash or hang, or the client gets disconnected. Most of this has all been thought over and handled in code. But what I'm worried about is someone tampering with the client so that it completely ignores the server's commands.
The customer will have access to a wide variety of 'toys' such as IDA, ILDASM, de4dot and various other debuggers and/or decompilers and Im fairly certain an experienced cracker will be able to figure out the public/private key combination within a short period of time. I know .NET code on its own is very insecure, but I'm not sure what to do against that other then using tools such as .NET Reactor & Dotfuscator etc.
My question: what sort of practices, code, ideas or anything can I put to use in order to either severely delay said cracker, or rather, how do I protect the private key at all costs.
Any hints, tips, suggestions or samples very appreciated!
","As @Corak stated, public/private key pairs usually work by keeping the private key private. On the client side, you can generate a new public/private key pair every time you connect. The easiest data to hide is the data that isn't saved in the first place.
The other part of your question is ""how to stop a cracker!"" That's not possible because the end-user has full control of the machine. You can play tricks to try to obfuscate your private key in memory, keep it out of the swap file, etc., etc., but any cracker with suitable tools and desire to crack your program will do it.
UNLESS!
You can partner with leading hardware vendors. Have them install a super-secure chip on all their hardware, and this chip will be under your control and not the user's control. When activated, this chip will monitor all I/O and memory and only allow what you decide to allow. Then you can simply disallow programs like IDA, rendering crackers helpless! As a side effect, you also get complete control over the user's computer, and you can use that power however you want. Everyone wins!
One last note: if you do decide to implement this, I recommend that your marketing department put a heavy spin on it. There'll probably be a bunch of jerks whining about ""privacy"" and ""ownership"" and crap like that. So you'll need a good name for this technology; the name has to sound like something people would want.
I think you should call it ""trustworthy computing"" (since ""trusted computing"" is already taken). Or maybe ""secure computing"".

Why am I getting this error?
","Typically public keys are required in X.509 format and private keys are required in PKCS#8 format. So, whenever you are dealing with public/private keys, you need to make sure that they are in appropriate format.
Read below from Oracle docs

So, first you need a key specification. You can obtain one via the
  following, assuming that the key was encoded according to the X.509
  standard, which is the case, for example, if the key was generated
  with the built-in DSA key-pair generator supplied by the SUN provider:

Main error you are getting is InvalidKeyException which says:

This is the exception for invalid Keys (invalid encoding, wrong
  length, uninitialized, etc).

Now in you case it is the invalid encoding which is resulting this error because you are using the generated public key in clear and not making it compatible with X509EncodedKeySpec. So, to fix you problem first encode your public key as per X.509 standard so that you can use in X509EncodedKeySpec

The question is about validation and making sure that public key is not changed so is the certificate (Man in the middle attack).
What I have planned so far is;

I give my EXE with license key and signed certificate (signed with private key) to the customer.
when customer enters license key, my EXE will validate it using public key (generating hash code, then decrypting certificate to get other hash code and compare)

Now problem is; if someone reverse engineers the EXE, changes the public key with his own public key and get a new certificate generated with his own private key. Then the EXE will always validate the certificate and my EXE is hacked.
Is this possible? If yes, what could be the solution to be sure my public key is not changed?
NOTE: There is no internet connection involved.
","To ensure integrity of something (executable, for example), sign it (or critical parts of it) with private key and check that the signature is valid every time you start the application.
Someone with enough time could of course figure out how the signature is done and replace that as well. They could bypass the check altogether. The only cure for that is encryption. But someone with enough time could work out the decryption algorithm...
The common way is to protect your license is to bind the software to some hardware, such as USB dongle, TPM or HDD serial number. This still does not guarantee that a determined hacker will not bypass your licensing.
There is no 100% protection against hackers. All you have to do is make it uneconomical for your users to hack it. Make the effort to hack a good deal more expensive than you are charging for the product. Make licensing terms very explicit and warn about risk of prosecution in case of breach. Build in reporting mechanism for suspected breaches so you can go after them.

","I've got the Solution:
In GPG version > 2.0.0 you can't pass a Password to the private key. This is restricted, cause of security reasons. The password shouldn't pass readable to the program. 
It could be fixed in two ways:
One way is to use a Key without a Password. Then you can use the Method without a Password.
The other way is to allow unattended processing. You can see here how to do that.

"5517687","RSA trick in email reply","A uses RSA encryption for her email. B ﬁnds an encrypted email to A: c = m^e mod n that he wants to know the plain text. B knows that when A replies to her email, she always includes the text of the message she is responding to in the reply.
Assume A only receives messages that are bit strings of length at most log n, which can be 
mapped to Zn.
Also assume that B cannot simply send c as his own email to A and expect a reply, but that A will respond to email messages other than c.
How can B learn m using only c, e, n and random values from Zn? 
","From wikipedia:

RSA has the property that the product
  of two ciphertexts is equal to the
  encryption of the product of the
  respective plaintexts. That is m1^e m2^e≡(m1m2)^e (mod n) Because
  of this multiplicative property a
  chosen-ciphertext attack is possible.
  E.g. an attacker, who wants to know
  the decryption of a ciphertext c = m^e
  (mod n) may ask the holder of the
  private key to decrypt an
  unsuspicious-looking ciphertext c' =
  cr^e (mod n) for some value r chosen by
  the attacker. Because of the
  multiplicative property c' is the
  encryption of mr (mod n). Hence, if
  the attacker is successful with the
  attack, he will learn mr (mod n) from
  which he can derive the message m by
  multiplying mr with the modular
  inverse of r modulo n.

That's actually pretty neat, thanks for asking the question that lead me to learning this.

","If you have encrypted file using Public key, file can be decrypted only using associated Private key. It is also called as Asymmetric Encryption. But sending your application private key out of application context will be a severe security breach. Public keys are meant to be shared publicly, not the Private Key.  
In your case you can encrypt your file on android device using PC/Sever public key, send it to  server and decrypt at server/PC using PC's Private key. This would be the only best solution.

This results in an error -50 and 0 cipher length.

","After some research I found a solution to the problem
I was creating the cipherBuffer using alloc and zero terminating the array, as follows:
let buflen = 64
var cipherBuffer = UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>.alloc(buflen)
cipherBuffer[buflen] = 0 // zero terminate

I tried the following approach and it works fine.
let blockSize = SecKeyGetBlockSize(publicKey) //64
var cipherBuffer = [UInt8](count: Int(blockSize), repeatedValue: 0)

Given that both approaches reported a block of 64 bytes with 0x00 using hexDump, I did a quick test and reviewed the previous code and found that removing the line with ""cipherBuffer[buflen] = 0"" fixes the problem.
It seems that it has to do with the zero termination of the array, or I may have done something weird.

"10071701","Ruby: Cryptographically sign a string to ensure authenticity?","Lets say I have a origin server which through the act of a redirect with particular query string params needs to provide details to a target server. However, I need to ensure those details came from my origin server only.
Also I can't sure the integrity of the target server. Or specifically, the target server might be compromised so any encryption keys might have been read by a malicious party.
I'm thinking I could sign the query string using some form of public/private keypair. The origin server uses a private key to sign the string, and the target server uses a public key to verify it came from my origin server, and the message hasn't been tampered with.
I'm far from a cryptography expert or anything, so any assumption here I've made might be wrong, please correct me if so :)
I'm basically after a (hopefully) simple way to do this in Ruby.
","Probably, the easiest form of signing the query data (in your case a redirection URL) is by using an HMAC. Your origin and destination server would need to share a common key in this case - HMACs are not a form of public/private key cryptography, but rather a form of keyed hashing.
The module you're looking for is ruby-hmac, and your source and destination server would have to do something like:
require 'hmac-md5'
HMAC::MD5.new(""<your shared key>"").update(""<your URL to check>"").hexdigest

and compare on the destination side that the digest computed by the HMAC on the source side is equivalent: both sides thus do the same computation. The hexdigest of the HMAC can simply be transported by an additional query parameter from source to destination.

","The general procedure is to asymmetrically (with RSA for example) transfer a symmetric key that can be used to encrypt/decrypt your payload with a symmetric cipher like AES (in combination with a block cipher mode like CBC). If possible you should avoid building such crypto yourself though. A rather user friendly library is NaCl for which the Sodium implementation purportedly can be used with iOS.

A system admin, which has access to this central server, approves the registration and asks a certificate authority to issue a public key certificate that binds the username to the public key. A x509 certificate is generated and stored at a certificate server.
When the user wants to authenticate, he enters his username and the app creates a digital signature for him, with his private key.

","I'd agree with Terry Chia that client auth SSL will give you a fast and easy way to get what you want.  Configure your web server with SSL and specifically client authentication, and provide the trusted CAs that the admin will use for signing approved certs.
The Java app will need to use an SSL library and have access to the way to set the credential for the library.  I think the default libary for SSL in Java may even do this, and may use the X509Certificate as a way to specify the credential.
What strikes me as odd in your description is that the client is not sending its certificate with the proof of private key (whether you sign it or use SSL, there is a proof of private key as either the signature or the SSL handshake).  It's far more typical to have the client say ""This is who I am, and here is proof"" - ie provide both the X509 Certificate and the proof of private key.  I suspect that the server *could• lookup the credential based on the public key, but it would be less efficient.

Since the padding is randomized, you cannot compare the ciphertext of both. You need to encrypt in one and decrypt in the other to see if the same hash is produced.

The output I get:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

It only prints the first part of the public key.
The public key is obtained from a local keyring file and processed as follows:
keyRingFileBuffer, err := os.Open(keyRingFilePath)

    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer keyRingFileBuffer.Close()

keyRing,err := openpgp.ReadKeyRing(keyRingFileBuffer)

","Whoops, after putting a bounty on the question I found an answer. Oh well.

","You're trying to perform a series of transformations, but you're not doing the opposite thing in each direction.
You've taken the encrypted binary data and converted it to base64, but then you're taking the base64 data and converting it back to binary using UTF-8, after splitting it by commas for some reason:
var dataArray = data.Split(new char[] { ',' });
byte[] dataByte = new byte[dataArray.Length];
dataByte = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data);

To reverse the last operation of the base64-encoding, you should be performing a base64-decoding:
byte[] dataByte = Convert.FromBase64String(data);

That may not be the only thing wrong, but it's the first thing I spotted.

Only using RSA allows for MITM-attacks  (if I'm not misstaken), so I was thinking encrypting the public keys with AES (the key that both have agreed upon) before sending them to respective parties *
I'm currently trying to build two applications that talks with eachother. To secure the exchanged messages I was thinking on using RSA where each application has it's own set of keys.
Before communication is started between the two applications they do need to exchange keys. That shouldn't be a problem but I was thinking on using AES to encrypt the public keys before sending them over the internet.
I know what the word public (as in public key) means but I was thinking that this would see to that the right application/computer gets the key and no one else. 
So I want to exchange keys and to protect them from MITM attacks.
If anybody could give a better suggestion (I'm using the LibCrypto library btw), I'm all ears.
Thank you.

","This question shows many misconceptions from your part.

I know what the word public (as in public key) means but I was
  thinking that this would see to that the right application/computer
  gets the key and no one else.

I think this is the real problem you have and ask.
Which I think is: How can you know that you are using the public key of the entity you actually want to communicate with and not the public key of a malicious entity claiming to be the who you want to communicate with?  
This problem is solved in a typical installation by certificates signed by a trusted authority and issued to the specific entity i.e. IP or DNS name.  
In your case you haven't given any details of your certificates.  
You could just as well manually pre-install them and use them for your secure connections.  
If you follow some other plan e.g. symmetric encryption then your would start asking other questions e.g. how do you securely share the secret key etc

How SSL key pinning prevents MITM attacks when some CA is
  compromised?

What I understand from comprising CA is, private keys are compromised and an attacker can easily get symmetric key used to encrypt data. Am I right?
Another thing, if public key remains same when certificates are rotated and in key pinning we match the public keys, how can we know that, key (we are getting) is from original certificate?
I don't really get the concept. Can anyone elaborate it step by step?
I have gone through this question but couldn't really get the answer.
","When a CA is compromised, the attacker has the CA's private key. Then the attacker has the same power as a trusted CA, meaning that he can issue certificates for any domains. If this happens, without public key pinning (HPKP), all sites are immediately vulnerable to MITM attacks by this attacker, until clients distrust the compromised CA.
HPKP tries to mitigate this issue by allowing site operations to designate which root CA or which leaf certificate's public keys you want browsers to trust. For instance, if you pin Let's Encrypt and GlobalSign's root certificates, then a compromise of any other CA won't affect you at all.
To answer your questions:
1) No, not symmetric keys. It is the private key of the CA, used for signing not encrypting, that gets compromised.
2) It doesn't matter, because the site is not compromised; only the CA is compromised. In other words, the attacker doesn't have the private keys of your site. If he wants to attack, he will have to present a different public key that he generates himself.
I hope this answer helps to clarify.

In the C language with OpenSSL, there are no arguments like in a program with argc and argv. There are functions and parameters.
In OpenSSL, you use the EVP functions to do it. In particular, EVP_Seal to encrypt and EVP_Open to decrypt using public key cryptography. See the EVP(3) man pages for more details. Or see OpenSSL's EVP Wiki page for details.
There are EVP_encrypt and EVP_Decrypt functions, but they are used for symmetric key encryption, and not public key encryption.

"53807792","How to implement asymmetric cryptography for distributed app where keys can both be stored as strings?","I have what seems to be a simple need - I want to generate a public key that I can put into an app, and use to to encrypt data that may be exposed to others. Later, using a private key known only to myself, I want to be able to decrypt that data.
There are bits and pieces of the solution to this scattered all over, but I have yet to find a good explanation of how to:

generate keys that can be turned into string representations that then can be used to reconstruct the keys
pass Data objects into the encryption, and get a string representation of the encrypted data
turn the string representing the encrypted data back into a Data object, and then decrypt this data into its original form
do all the above only using Swift 4.1 or newer

I am aware that there are frameworks that can do this, but it seems like this should ultimately be a fairly small piece of code and so a framework is overkill.
","Inspiration for this answer comes from Swift 3 export SecKey to String and NSString Crypt.m gist.
Don't know what PKI (Public Key Encryption)is? Then a nice tutorial:  Everything you should know about certificates and PKI but are too afraid to ask
The recommended way to use public/private encryption for large data sets is to use public/private encryption to first share a temporary symmetric key, then use that key to encrypt, send the data, and allow the remote side to decrypt it. 
That seemed like a complex task, but then it turned out that Apple already provides this capability for iOS/macOS (search for ""In fact, the certificate, key, and trust services API provides a simple way to accomplish this."")
The code below is designed as a test vehicle to let anyone experiment with the settings. You exercise it twice - one with the #if set to true, the second to false. In the first run (using the Simulator for sure), you get string representations of the public and private keys. You then paste those into the class properties, change the #if setting, and re-run the test method.
The test method then re-creates both keys, encrypts the supplied data, then hands that encrypted data off to be decrypted. In the end, the original data is compared to the decrypted data and the result printed out. The raw code is available as gist on github.
The code is constructed as a test vehicle - you can run it as is to have it produce two strings representing the private and public key, then paste those in below to verify that the strings themselves perform exactly as a test with keys freshly generated. The test has four stages:

run an encrypt and decrypt with just the generated keys (SecKeys)
convert the public key to a string, then recreate a new public SecKey from the string, then do the encrypt/decrypt test
same as above except convert private key to string and back
same as above but both keys converted to strings and back

The gist above also contains a class Asymmetric that just uses the public key to encrypt data - this is what you would use in an app (but it's completely based on methods in this class).
You use either a RSA algorithm or an Elliptic Curve key pair. With the current key size, both use a AES 128-bit symmetric key for actual data encryption (see Apple headers). 
#if true
private let keyType = kSecAttrKeyTypeRSA // kSecAttrKeyTypeEC

"48997526","Does OpenSSL provide any post quantum asymmetric algorithms?","I'm familiar with classical encryption algorithms and mathematics, like RSA and ECC, but just out of interest. I'm not a specialist in this field. I'd like to start a long-term project, but since I'm not a cryptographer, it's very difficult to research this topic and get a clear and correct answer. I'm looking to use OpenSSL as a black-box for this purpose.
My question: Does OpenSSL provide any post quantum asymmetric algorithms for both encryption and/or signatures?
If not, are there any plans in the future to support this?
PS: Please note that I'm not asking for software recommendation as I understand this is off-topic. I'm asking about OpenSSL here and its supported algorithms.
","No, it does not.
However, you should monitor the Open Quantum Safe project, which creates a library that operates with OpenSSL with the view of introducing post-quantum safe algorithms into OpenSSL.

"25371892","How to encrypt data in objective-c using a public key generated from php script","I've looked around and found scant information on encryption on Mac OS X.  It seems like OpenSSL support is deprecated in newer version of Mac OS X. I need to be able to support from 10.5 and up.  Here's my problem:
I have a public and private key pair generate on our licensing server using php (code shown below)
$dn = array(configs....);
$privkey = openssl_pkey_new();

$csr = openssl_csr_new($dn, $privkey);

$sscert = openssl_csr_sign($csr, null, $privkey, $term);

openssl_x509_export($sscert, $publickey);
openssl_pkey_export($privkey, $privatekey, ""somepassphrase"");

//base64 encode the keys
$privatekey = base64_encode($privatekey);
$publickey = base64_encode($publickey);

The base64 encoded private key is stored in a secure location on one of our servers and the base64 encoded public key is written to a file for download by our users.  The file is loaded into a desktop application for MacOS X written in cocoa, which base64 decodes the public key.  Until this step is good.  However, I want to then encrypt data with the public key and send it to our license server.  Does anyone know how I can use this public key to encrypt data in cocoa and what is the ""best"" practice method?  Any examples or tips would be much appreciated!
","It is not so much OpenSSL that is deprecated on the Mac but merely the OpenSSL libraries that are provided by OS X are deprecated. Nothing stops you from compiling your own OpenSSL and use it in your app by statically linking to it:

Although OpenSSL is commonly used in the open source community,
  OpenSSL does not provide a stable API from version to version. For
  this reason, although OS X provides OpenSSL libraries, the OpenSSL
  libraries in OS X are deprecated, and OpenSSL has never been provided
  as part of iOS. Use of the OS X OpenSSL libraries by apps is strongly
  discouraged.
If your app depends on OpenSSL, you should compile OpenSSL yourself
  and statically link a known version of OpenSSL into your app. This use
  of OpenSSL is possible on both OS X and iOS. However, unless you are
  trying to maintain source compatibility with an existing open source
  project, you should generally use a different API.
Common Crypto and Security Transforms are the recommended alternatives
  for general encryption. CFNetwork and Secure Transport are the
  recommended alternatives for secure communications.

In other words: It is still fine to use OpenSSL in your OS X app - just don't rely on the bundled OpenSSL anymore. Alternatively, you can make use of OS X' Security Framework: It is capable of handling X.509 public key encryption which you seem to be doing as well.

","To answer your first question. While it may look like it is producing Chinese characters what is actually happening is it is turning a byte array into unicode. In c# typically when you want to store a byte array you convert it to base64 which is what your second example appears to return.
Your first example would become this:
var encryptedBytes = myBytes.RSAEncrypt(publicKey);
Convert.ToBase64String(encryptedBytes) // this line changed
returns strings like ""AnvFFT6YKpoiAy....""

As for what is recommended, the most common is to use base64. The reasons people use base64 over unicode or UTF-8 for binary data can be found in these answers:

Since this is (for me, at least) new and untested code, I was wondering how I can diagnose this problem further?  
Is there some additional logging or something that might help to find out what is wrong or pinpoint the problem?
I know that this is going to sound a little unusual, but also, FYI, I was given the signed assertion and private key that I am using to test right now, by a third party, so I am actually not 100% sure if they are good, so I was wondering if maybe there is somewhere I could get/download a known-good encrypted assertion example together with the corresponding private key, so that I could try to test my code above with known-good data?
Thanks,
Jim

EDIT 2: For someone who is familiar with OpenSAML and SAML:  Is there something wrong with the signed assertion above?  I've been doing some additional testing, and it seems like none of the resolvers are able to find the encryption key and I noticed that the ds:Keyinfo is embedded inside xenc:EncryptedData, at the same level as the xenc:CipherData.

","Check this older response form stackoverflow: 
I don't see issues on encrypting you adapter request/response payload(the data you send and receive inside of an adapter call). 
Worklight adapter calls are not encrypted (WL.Client.invokeProcedure)
Although, if you encrypt the entire request(or response) used by this will confuse  the adapter Client/Server  internal communication protocol. 
If you want extra protection on on the transport layer(Like HTTP/HTTPS) and maybe an extra layer. I would check if in your case, a IBM DataPower would not what you are searching for: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_WebSphere_DataPower_SOA_Appliances
Application Layer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer
You can use also the adapter mash up technic at the adapter calls in a single adapter endpoint to prevent unwanted eyes to try ton reverse engineer this call by its name, and this 1st adapter can decrypt the payload at the server-side and send to the wanted adapter internally(inside the server-side). 
https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/adapters/advanced-adapter-usage-mashup/

I tried using <keygen> but it requires using forms and user intervention.
","Consider using WebCrypto
Specifically, crypto.subtle.generateKey will do the key generation.

The key can be temporary as long as you discard it securely and/or invalidate it after its desired validity period has expired.  Depending on how your system works, you may want to validate the expiry/validity of a given key by rolling it into the hash.
Here is a tutorial which offers a cross-browser solution.
Hashing the key (and/or other data) can be done using other parts of the WebCrypto API (see crypto.subtle.digest)

Like many posters on various sites I had trouble piecing together exactly the bits I needs to verify the signature of an AWS JWT token externally i.e., server side or via script
I think I figured out out and put a gist to verify an AWS JWT token signature. It'll verify an AWS JWT/JWS token with either pyjwt or PKCS1_v1_5c from Crypto.Signature in PyCrypto
So, yes this was python in my case but it's also doable easily in node (npm install jsonwebtoken jwk-to-pem request). 
I attempted to highlight some gotchas in the comments because when I was trying to figure this out I was mostly doing the right thing but there were some nuances like python dict ordering, or lack there of, and json representation.
I've also noticed some questions around about doing the validation using the signers Certificate. I'll amend my gist to show this also.

My question is: Is following communication secure?

Adding a User:

Client requests sign up

Server creates public key and sends it to the client.

Client encrypts username+password with public key and sends it to the server.

Server accepts connection, hashes salted password, stores it in a keystore and
informs client about accepted sign up. (the decision, if a client will be
accepted or declined will be made by the user of the phone)


Communication for registered users:

Client requests service

Server creates public key and sends it to the client.

Client sends username+password+symmetric communication key to server.

Server verifies username and password using stored hash and salt. Server starts
symmetrically encrypted communication with client.

","You can't go directly cast a BigInteger to a Key. A Key should be constructed from two BigIntegers, the modulus and the exponent. Try this:

I think you mean this, by ""ignore Certificates and Signing of messages""

Cryptosystem is not broken.


Symmetric cipher is not broken (RC4 is broken, for example)
Asymmetric cipher is not broken
One-way Hash function is not broken
Random number generator is not broken


Under these conditions, that's perfectly safe. In fact what you described in your question is how PGP works.

That's where your biggest vulnerability is.
Protocols such as TLS (which can use RSA) SSH and PGP provide a well defined mechanism for negotiating encryption, and implementations such as openssl provide a documented, tested, portable, robust and we'll tested abstraction layer. 
Rolling your own solution carries massive risks of injecting vulnerabilities. And entails ongoing pain in maintenance.
BTW RC4 is considered broken by many people.

openssl dgst -sign id_rsa content_file > signature_file
Is there any way to verify that the signature corresponds with the content/public key within Postgres?
I have looked at the pgcrypto functions however the only relevant function seems to be pgp_pub_decrypt which requires the secret key.
Basically I am looking to perform the following in Postgres:
openssl dgst -verify .\id_rsa.pem -signature .\signature_file .\content_file
","As per Craig's suggestion, I ended up using plpythonu to solve this.
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION api.verify(
  p_data text,
  p_signature text,
  p_publickey text
)

   try:
     import rsa

     pubkey = rsa.PublicKey.load_pkcs1(p_publickey)
     signature = bytearray.fromhex(p_signature)
     verified = rsa.verify(p_data, signature, pubkey)

     return verified
   except:
     return False

$$ LANGUAGE plpythonu VOLATILE
  SECURITY DEFINER;

With my lack of python knowledge, the hardest part of this was actually setting up the required python packages (Docker environment in my case). Here is the relevant excerpt from the Dockerfile:
FROM postgres:9.6

# Install necessary python packages to work with postgres
RUN apt-get update \
 && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    ""postgresql-plpython-$PG_MAJOR"" \
 && apt-get install -y python-pip python-dev

# Install python rsa module for signature verification
RUN pip install rsa

The function worked given the following parameters:
-- Generate private key. Provide secure passphrase when prompted.
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private.pem 4096

--Export public KEY
openssl rsa -in private.pem -RSAPublicKey_out -out public.pem

--Sign data. Provide secure passphrase when prompted.
--Remove first line (RSA-SHA256(data.txt)=) when passing into database verify function.
openssl dgst -hex -sign private.pem data.txt > signature.txt

","The libsodium documentation refers to an ""authentication tag"" which is explained in a different chapter in the following section:
This operation: 

 * Encrypts a message with a key and a nonce to keep it confidential.
 * Computes an authentication tag. This tag is used to make sure that
   the message hasn't been tampered with before decrypting it.

So what libsodium calls authentication tag is equivalent to the more common terminology of signing a message. Therefore it makes sense for the crypto_box_easy(...) function to take the senders private key as input since the encryption really is encryption and signing.

In my view the answer should be n*n (or n^2 or n squared)
Reason:
There are ‘n’ Parties.
Every Party has One (1) Public Key (for Encryption).
Also, every Party has n-1 private keys (paired) (for Decryption)
So every party has 1 + n-1 = n keys, and there are n parties communicating.
No. of Keys required is = n x n = n^2.
So Am I correct? (Please be specific & also show the full logic & give proper explanations).
","n key pairs is enough.
Every party generates a private/public key pair and publishes the public part.
When Alice wants to communicate with Bob, she encrypts her message with Bobs public key and now only Bob (not even Alice!) can decrypt it.
I think you are confusing this with secret key (aka symmetric) crypto, where every communication channel must have its own key, and there are n*(n-1)/2 channels for n parties.

","You can generate secure symmetric keys from an email address, any string for that matter, with a key derivation function such as PBKDF2 (aka Rfc2898DeriveBytes).
RSA is asymmetric encryption with separate keys for encryption and decryption, symmetric encryption such as AES uses one key for both encryption and decryption.
Asymmetric encryption  such as RSA has the advantage of two keys where the encryption key can be publicly known. But it is very slow and the data size, the keys are large (2048-bits is a currently secure size) and the data length is limited to the key size, it is generally used to encrypt symmetric keys. There is no control over symmetric key pair creation other than length.  Use asymmetric encryption only when a public/private key pair must be used.
Asymmetric encryption such as AES is fast, has smaller keys with 128-bits common and secure and can handle data of essentially any length.

","Generally speaking, you can't. Encrypted data is, in almost all cases, indistinguishable from random or heavily compressed data.
In some situations, there may be circumstantial evidence to suggest that the data you're seeing is encrypted. For instance, it may contain headers characteristic of TLS or SSH, or it may be transmitted on a port that is typically used for encrypted data (e.g, 443 for HTTPS). However, this is all a matter of guesswork — if you don't recognize the data, it could be anything.

Consider this simple example (python):
def xor(s1, s2): return ''.join(chr(ord(a) ^ ord(b)) for a,b in zip(s1, s2))

key = '\x07\x07\x04\x16\x00\x1b\x12N\x17\x1a\x0eHO\x14T\x03\x10\x17R\n\x16V\x04\n\x06\x00\r\x1e'
message = 'this is such a secret message'

ciphertext = xor(message, key)

This is a simple xor-cipher, which can be used e.g. in one-time-pads. Nothing wrong with it obviously, but if you print the ciphertext you get: 'some random output obviously'.
The secret message is properly encrypted, but the output is something that does not look encrypted at all.
I've chosen the key by xoring message and the example output ;-) but a key like this is basically random and can be the result of any random number generator.
You can never tell if data is encrypted, encoded, compressed, masked, or whatever just by looking on the bits, because these bits can look like something unencrypted even if they are. This is also the reason why a OTP can't be bruteforced because you can never tell if the bruteforced plaintext is the correct plaintext: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad#Attempt_at_cryptanalysis

","It is not possible to prove that data is encrypted or not, but you can analyze the frequency of data values to filter out packets that are likely to be encrypted. 
Properly-encrypted data is nearly indistinguishable from random noise. So if you are looking for encrypted data, you should see a fairly even representation of characters. There is a great tool called pcaphistogram.pl for analyzing packets this way. You can get it here: http://www.willhackforsushi.com/code/pcaphistogram.pl.txt
Here is a sample histogram of properly-encrypted data:

Below is a sample histogram of plain-text data. Notice how the values bunch up in the printable region. If you compare this to an ASCII table, you will see lots of lower-case letters(61-7a), a few upper-case(41-5a), spaces (20) and the carriage-return (0a):

Below is a sample histogram for text data that was encrypted with an XOR. The XOR shifted all of the characters, but the basic shape is the same as the unencrypted set.

Note that you need a reasonably large data sample in order to use this technique.

"17053432","How to use public-key encryption in Py4A scripts?","I'm developing an Py4a (Python in SL4a) application running on an Android phone.
The application collects some sensitive data, and then sends it via e-mail, using the smtplib module.
To assure necessary protection, I need to encrypt that information.
As phone is considered to be unsafe device, I have to use the public-key encryption, and only recipient's public key should be stored in the phone.
The standard Py4a distribution contains two packages supporting public key cryptography:
the ssl and gdata.
Unfortunately none of them provides a ready to use function, allowing me to encrypt longer information with the private key.
Well, I know that in fact I should generate a random temporary symmetric key, encrypt my information with that key, and finally encrypt only this key with the recipient's public key. However there are some details which must be considered to obtain secure solution...
So here my question comes. Is there any simple encryption library, well suited to Py4a (ie. based on the cryptographic libraries already available in Py4a - like ssl and gdata.Crypto) providing easy to use public key encryption?
Update 2013.06.13
I have performed some experiments with the gdata library in Py4a.
Finally I have get the following ""quick&dirty"" solution:
import gdata.tlslite.utils.keyfactory as rk
#Generate the recipient's RSA key
sec=rk.generateRSAKey(1024)
#obtain the publickey, which will be stored
#in the sender mobile phone
pubxml=sec.writeXMLPublicKey()
print pubxml
#Create the public key from XML
pub=rk.parseXMLKey(pubxml)
#
#Now lets simulate the sender
#It has only access to ""pub"" 
#
import gdata.tlslite.utils.PyCrypto_AES as sk
import gdata.tlslite.utils.cipherfactory as cf
#Generate random key and initioalization vectors
key=sk.getRandomBytes(32)
iv=sk.getRandomBytes(16)

#Here we should check if the key and iv are reasonable
#Now we accept them as they are

#Text to encrypt
txt1=""Strictly secret unknown text!""
#Pad the text to the length N*16
padlen=16-(len(txt1) % 16)
if padlen:
   txt1=txt1.ljust(len(txt1)+padlen, "" "")
#Create the AES key
ak=cf.createAES(key.tostring(),iv.tostring())
#Encrypt text
ctxt1=ak.encrypt(txt1)
#Encrypt key and initialization vector with recipients publickey
ckey1=pub.encrypt(key+iv)
#
# Now we simulate the recipient
# It has its secret key 'sec', and received encrypted key
# and iv from the sender in ckey1. It also receives ctxt1
#
pkey1=sec.decrypt(ckey1)
pkey=pkey1[0:32]
piv=pkey1[32:48]
# Now we decipher the text
pak=cf.createAES(pkey.tostring(),piv.tostring())
ptxt1=pak.decrypt(ctxt1)
# Print the deciphered text
print ptxt1

Probably this solution is far from being optimal, but it at least works.
","Because the phone is an unsecure device, you cannot trust anything that is computed on the phone. If you want something done securely, do it on your server. 
As for your question, this is just how public cryptography (at least RSA) works: you cannot encrypt any data that is longer than the key. The reason there are not libraries for this is that it is impossible. If you need secure email use S/MIME or GPG and don't try to reinvent the wheel. Also note that since the key needs to be in the app, anyone can extract it and decrypt your data. If you just want to send data securely, a better approach might be so send the data over HTTPS. Then you don't need to manage client keys and your data will be protected in transit.

Blowfish is present as separate cipher class but I could not figure out a way to use it along with enveloped data(which is important because I will be using public key encryption method). I can actually encrypt using blowfish,then wrap using enveloped data and some algorithm such as aes and send this but the receiver won't have the algorithm info in that case. Secret key can be passed along with recepientInfo.
If anyone can possible show me the way een basic I may be able to proceed.
Thanks in advance

","Hi I came up with the solution 
ByteArrayInputStream is = new ByteArrayInputStream(message);
  AlgorithmID blowfish=new AlgorithmID(""1.3.6.1.4.1.3029.1.2"",""BLOWFISH_CBC"",""Blowfish/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");
  byte[] iv = new byte[8];
    random.nextBytes(iv);
  try{
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""Blowfish"", ""IAIK"");
        secretKey = keyGen.generateKey();

        AlgorithmParameterSpec params = new IvParameterSpec(iv);

        keyGen.init(128);

        secretKey = keyGen.generateKey();
        iaik.pkcs.pkcs7.EncryptedContentInfoStream eci = new iaik.pkcs.pkcs7.EncryptedContentInfoStream(ObjectID.pkcs7_data, is);
        eci.setupCipher(blowfish, secretKey, params);
        return eci;
  }catch(Exception e){

  }

Tell me if this way is wrong or can be improved or there is another way of doing this.
thanks

"45446369","What is the algorithm of PGP to encrypt messages?","
Is there any documentation that explains what are the mathematical algorithms used in PGP to encrypt a message (key generation, converting a message into a number, signature...) ?

For example, suppose that I have a friend who is using a third-party software to encrypt and decrypt messages with PGP, and I want to send him a message, e.g. ""Hello my friend!"", and I want to encrypt the message myself without using a third-party software. How do I generate my pair of keys, and how do I calculate the signed-encrypted message ?
I aware about asymetric encryption, DSA, RSA, SHA-1, etc... but I can't find any documentation about PGP algorithm.
","PGP and some other derivated software initially used a closed file format. This was a problem, so P. Zimmermann (that wrote and first published the software named PGP in year 1991) wrote a RFC (with co-authors W. Stallings and D. Atkins), titled PGP Message Exchange Formats published in year 1996 by the IETF: this RFC number is ... 1991 (easy to remember: PGP first published in 1991, RFC number 1991, repeat after me, ...).
Note that this RFC is not a standard: it is only an informational document. Nobody should claim conformance to it. It has been published only because, as stated by Postel, Huitema, and Crocker in RFC-1796: Rather Document Than Ignore.
This RFC has been obsoleted by RFC-2440, titled OpenPGP Message Format, and this one is a standard. The latter has been obsoleted by RFC-4880, with same title and same category (standards track). And finally, RFC-5581 added some minor updates to RFC-4880. These specifications explain which algorithms are used and how to use them to format messages.
There are many implementations of this format and cryptographic operations. You will even find JavaScript implementations. A notable online service that lets your browser use JavaScript to manage Open PGP messages is available here: https://keybase.io This is not an implementation of a protocol: you have to copy/paste the  encoded ciphertext to you mail user agent, for instance, if you want to send OpenPGP messages built with the help of this service.

"51286633","Java BC SicBlockCipher direct output equivalent in c#","I am implementing something in C#, for which I have a separate spec and fairly clear understanding of what I need to do, but at the same time as a reference I have a Java implementation and would like to follow the Java implementation in this case as close as I can.
The code involves an encrypted stream and the Java source is here 
The relevant lines are here:
  private final StreamCipher enc;
...
  BlockCipher cipher;
  enc = new SICBlockCipher(cipher = new AESEngine());
  enc.init(true, new ParametersWithIV(new KeyParameter(secrets.aes), new byte[cipher.getBlockSize()]));
...
...
byte[] ptype = RLP.encodeInt((int) frame.type); //Result can be a single byte long
...
...
enc.processBytes(ptype, 0, ptype.length, buff, 0);
out.write(buff, 0, ptype.length); //encrypt and write a single byte from the SICBlockCipher stream

The above Java BouncyCastle SicBlockCipher is a StreamCipher and allows processing a single or small number of bytes less than the Aes block size. 
In c# BouncyCastle the SicBlockCipher only offers ProcessBlock and BufferedBlockCipher does not seem to offer a way of guaranteeing an output using ProcessBytes. 
What do I need to do with C# BouncyCastle library to achieve the equivalent functionality?
","Unfortunately the SicBlockCipher itself is not implemented as a stream cipher, so this functionality is (indeed) not available directly.
BufferedBlockCipher has been created with many different modes of operation in mind. It buffers the input, while for counter (CTR) mode which SicBlockCipher implements, you would need to buffer the encrypted counter blocks instead.
The encrypted counter blocks make up the key stream, which can then be XOR'ed with the plaintext to create the cipherstream (or indeed, with the ciphertext to retrieve the plaintext again, encryption is decryption for counter mode).
The only way I see how to do this is to create your own implementation of IBlockCipher and implement said functionality.

Here is the counter mode as stream cipher...

"51286633","Java BC SicBlockCipher direct output equivalent in c#","I am implementing something in C#, for which I have a separate spec and fairly clear understanding of what I need to do, but at the same time as a reference I have a Java implementation and would like to follow the Java implementation in this case as close as I can.
The code involves an encrypted stream and the Java source is here 
The relevant lines are here:
  private final StreamCipher enc;
...
  BlockCipher cipher;
  enc = new SICBlockCipher(cipher = new AESEngine());
  enc.init(true, new ParametersWithIV(new KeyParameter(secrets.aes), new byte[cipher.getBlockSize()]));
...
...
byte[] ptype = RLP.encodeInt((int) frame.type); //Result can be a single byte long
...
...
enc.processBytes(ptype, 0, ptype.length, buff, 0);
out.write(buff, 0, ptype.length); //encrypt and write a single byte from the SICBlockCipher stream

The above Java BouncyCastle SicBlockCipher is a StreamCipher and allows processing a single or small number of bytes less than the Aes block size. 
In c# BouncyCastle the SicBlockCipher only offers ProcessBlock and BufferedBlockCipher does not seem to offer a way of guaranteeing an output using ProcessBytes. 
What do I need to do with C# BouncyCastle library to achieve the equivalent functionality?
","Having had something of an epiphany about streaming and block ciphers based on Maarten Bodewes helpful and informative answers (many thanks!) I also came up with the below approach.
The .NET BC library has a StreamBlockCipher class, as in Java, but has a guard in its ctor or initializer that the underlying cipher should have a block size of 1.
To use the StreamBlockCipher then, I created a subclass of SicBlockCipher that buffers the block of keystream internally. I named it StreamableSicBlockCipher. It is not yet tested but if there are issues, it at least points the direction to another way.
 public class StreamableSicBlockCipher : SicBlockCipher
{
    private int blockSize;
    private int position = 0;
    private byte[] zeroBlock;
    private byte[] keyStreamBlock;

    public StreamableSicBlockCipher(IBlockCipher cipher) : base(cipher)
    {
        blockSize=cipher.GetBlockSize();
        zeroBlock = new byte[blockSize];
        keyStreamBlock = new byte[blockSize];
    }



    public override int GetBlockSize()
    {
        return 1;
    }

    public override int ProcessBlock(byte[] input, int inOff, byte[] output, int outOff)
    {
        int keyStreamBlockOffset = position % blockSize;

        if (0==keyStreamBlockOffset)
        {

            var cipher = GetUnderlyingCipher();
            cipher.ProcessBlock(zeroBlock, 0, keyStreamBlock, 0);

            // Increment the counter
            int j = zeroBlock.Length;
            while (--j >= 0 && ++zeroBlock[j] == 0)
            {
            }
        }

        output[outOff] = (byte)(input[inOff] ^ keyStreamBlock[keyStreamBlockOffset]);

        position++;

        return 1;

    }
    public override void Reset()
    {
        base.Reset();
        this.position = 0;

    }

It can then be called using the appropriate wrappers as follows:
StreamBlockCipher EncCipher = new StreamBlockCipher(new StreamableSicBlockCipher(new AesEngine()));

Initialisation can be done using an instance of IBlockCipher the get the block size. Example below inits with empty IV, using 'Cipher' which is an instance of AESEngine.:
 EncCipher.Init(true, new ParametersWithIV(new KeyParameter(cryptoSecret), new byte[Cipher.GetBlockSize()]));

What they are asking is the following:

Certificate with 4096 bits public key for encryption (.pem or .cer

SSL certificate for sending callback response on call back URL.

I generated the self-signed SSL certificate using OpenSSL & shared with them along with the private key (I know we shouldn't). They asked me to share a valid public key & SSL certificate. 
I even generated a certificate & private key on DigiCert, but couldn't figure out how to generate a public key for SSL Certificate.  
Can anyone kindly suggest how to generate Public key & private key for the SSL Certificate? 
Kindly also suggest if I can use Comodo or DigiCert to generate a public key for the SSL certificate?
","An SSL Certificate is a public key verified and signed by a Certificate Authority. You generate a public/private key pair, then from that generate a Certificate Signing Request (which includes the public key), which you send to the CA. It then signs that public key included in the CSR producing the certificate which is sends back to you. See also here.
It sounds like you already have this though, so you'd need to clarify what you're trying to achieve. It sounds like it may be a client authentication / mutual authentication scenario? If so, it depends on what the service provider requires - certificates for client authentication may need to be signed either by a public authority that the server trusts, or by the server itself.

Then the information pushed to the queue for the private key is smaller than the encoded data for the public key:

Is this expected and is this the right way to generate my public key that will be shared with others?
I've only every worked with RSA before and the public key is much smaller than the private key.
","So... treading lightly because modulo arithmetic is not my strong point...
Source of my information is here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm

Choose an approved cryptographic hash function H. In the original DSS, H was always SHA-1, but the stronger SHA-2 hash functions are approved for use in the current DSS.[5][9] The hash output may be truncated to the size of a key pair.
Decide on a key length L and N. This is the primary measure of the cryptographic strength of the key. The original DSS constrained L to be a multiple of 64 between 512 and 1024 (inclusive). NIST 800-57 recommends lengths of 2048 (or 3072) for keys with security lifetimes extending beyond 2010 (or 2030), using correspondingly longer N.[10] FIPS 186-3 specifies L and N length pairs of (1024,160), (2048,224), (2048,256), and (3072,256).
Choose an N-bit prime q. N must be less than or equal to the hash output length.

(so q is N bits long - say 256 for a 3072-bit key)

Choose an L-bit prime modulus p such that p–1 is a multiple of q.
  Choose g, a number whose multiplicative order modulo p is q. This may be done by setting g = h(p–1)/q mod p for some arbitrary h (1 < h < p−1), and trying again with a different h if the result comes out as 1. Most choices of h will lead to a usable g; commonly h=2 is used.

(so p would be 3072 bits long)
The algorithm parameters (p, q, g) may be shared between different users of the system.

Per-user keys
Given a set of parameters, the second phase computes private and public keys for a single user:
Choose x by some random method, where 0 < x < q.
  Calculate y = gx mod p.
Public key is (p, q, g, y). 

public key has a p in it - so it must be at least 3072 bits long

Private key is x.

since x depends on q, it will have (in our case) 256 bits - this is the private key length.
Does that seem reasonable?

Example (Rabin public-key encryption with artificially small
  parameters) Key generation. Entity A chooses the primes p = 277, q =
  331, and computes n = pq =
  91687. A’s public key is n = 91687, while A’s private key is (p = 277, q = 331). 
Encryption. Suppose that the last six bits of original
  messages are required to be replicated prior to encryption (cf. Note
  8.14(i)). 
  In order to encrypt the 10-bit message m = 1001111001, B replicates the last six bits of m to obtain the 16-bit message m = 1001111001111001, which in 
  decimal notation is m = 40569. B then computes c = m2 mod n = 405692 mod 91687 
  = 62111 and sends this to A.
Decryption. To decrypt c, A uses Algorithm 3.44 and her knowledge of
  the factors of n to compute the four square roots of c mod n: m1 =
  69654, m2 = 22033, m3 = 40569, m4 = 51118, which in binary are m1 =
  10001000000010110, m2 = 101011000010001, m3 = 1001111001111001, m4 =
  1100011110101110. 
  Since only m3 has the required redundancy, A decrypts c to m3 and
  recovers the original message m = 1001111001

Each client(having some data) generates a symmetric key(AES) at client side and encrypt the data locally and sends to the server. The clients secret key is provisioned to the server via remote attestation and then use this secret key to decrypt the data inside the SGX enclave. 
Approach 2:
The server generates public-private key pair inside enclave and the public key is sent to each client. Each client then encrypts using public key and then send data to the server which is later decrypted using the previously generated private key.

Now, I have gone through numerous questions over at Stackoverflow, but given my Ruby code, what I'm doing wrong that the encrypted text can't be decrypted on the API end. Obviously, the API end is using Java.
I'm a completely noob when it comes to encryption, but through encrypting and decrypting in Ruby, I have made sure that the implementation is correct in Ruby. The problem arises when the text encrypted through Ruby language gets decrypted through Java on the API end.
","I wrote a very simple Java program to decrypt the output from that very simple Ruby program and it worked fine. Thus, not surprisingly, there's no inherent incompatibility between the ruby openssl module and standard Java cryptography. Without any more info about the Java side, all we can do is list some of the possibilities:

Mismatched keys

The public key you are using must correspond to the private key the Java side is using. If not, you'll likely receive the BadPadding exception.

Formatting issues

Obviously what you transmit, base64 encoded strings with embedded newlines, must be correctly parsed and decoded on the Java side. Getting a single byte wrong can cause the error you see. Most base64 decoders either choke on the newlines and throw an exception or ignore them. Neither explanation would result in a BadPaddingException. Perhaps the Java side is expecting Base64URL instead of Base64? If the Java side is expecting base64url encoding and if it ignores invalid characters then this could be the problem. It's worth trying to remove whitespace including newlines from the base64 output, and if that doesn't work then try encoding with a base64url encoder (again, remove any whitespace from the output).

","This is really a nice one :) OK, let's start from the beginning. 

I checked whether I can Base64-decode the contents of the string with problems -> yes
I checked whether the decoded byte array is a valid DER encoding -> yes
I checked whether the DER encoding represents an RSA public key -> yes
I checked whether I could parse the original string as an RSA public key directly -> no

WTF?! Then I reencoded the RSA public key I was able to decode to PEM - and it gave me:
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
... same Base64 as in your string ...
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

See the difference - it's the PEM headers. The structure that is Base64-encoded is the generic X.509 representation of a public key (therefore also the difference in the headers), and not the RSA-specific representation described in PKCS#1, which your headers would imply! If you change the PEM headers, then it'll work!

"44810996","Is storing a private key possible to be secure?","This question is about a project of mine. I have a server-side application running on my Raspberry Pi, while the client-side application is supposed to be distributed on all my other devices. The following exzerpt is showing the code of the client-side.
I've been digging the Internet and what I have gathered is that in the end there no 100% safe way to store a private key. However, it is considered good practice to safe all keys in a KeyStore. The following is my solution to it, but my problem is: the KeyStore-file, client.jks, lies inside the JAR, together with the hardcoded password. client.jks contains the server-side's public key and the client-side's private key.
        KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS"");
        keyStore.load(new FileInputStream(KEYSTORE), PASSWORD.toCharArray());

        KeyManagerFactory keyManagerFactory = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance(""SunX509"");

        TrustManagerFactory trustManagerFactory = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(""SunX509"");
        trustManagerFactory.init(keyStore);

        SSLSocket connection = (SSLSocket) sslContext.getSocketFactory().createSocket(""localhost"", 6789);
        System.out.println(""Connection successful!"");

The Strings KEYSTORE and PASSWORD contain the KeyStore-file and the password, both hardcoded.
Is this really the best practice or am I missing something? Is the new SecureRandom object created for every connection enough to make the connection safe?

"33540667","Check RSA encryption via public key: command-line vs SQL Server","I have done some search, both here and on the web, but apparently it seems to be difficult to find a similar issue around, so I decided to post a question here.
I have the following task to accomplish (and unfortunately I am not an expert in OpenSSL encryption), having the following ingredients:

a SQL Server database (where I have 'sa' access rights, if necessary);
a DER certificate with a public key only.

I am requested to encrypt some DB data using that public key, and the result of the encryption must be the same I would obtain by using the following command (it uses the PKCS#1 v 1.5 padding, if I understood well):
.\openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey <public key cert> -certin -pkcs

I know that SQL Server can import a certificate and encrypt data, but I don't know how/if I can set any options to drive the encryption process (e.g.: which padding it should use) in order to make sure that I really reproduced the  template I was given.
On the other hand, if I am not wrong, since I have no private key, then I cannot test my encryption by just encrypting some data via SQL Server and then de-crypting them via the openssl command.
As an alternative, I thought that a check method could consist in encrypting the same data via openssl and via SQL Server, and then check if the returned strings are the same. Unfortunately, I learned from another StackOverflow question the every time a data is encrypted it is applied some random padding which cause the encrypted string to be always different.
Then, the first question: is it possible, both in the openssl command and in SQL Server, to temporarily 'fix' the used random seed, in order to make sure that every time one encrypts a string, it will always be applied the same padding, in order to be able to compare the results?
As an alternative, I would try to do my tests with a test certificate which I could try to generate with a pair of keys, but in this case I have some silly questions:

how can I generate a pair of keys and then create a certificate with the public key which will be an analogue to the one I was provided by the entity I will have to send data to?
how can I make sure that the format of this 'test' certificate is compliant to that of the production certificate provided to me?

Thanks a lot for every help and best regards. Sorry if my question can appear silly, but I am not an expert in this topic.

Thanks in advance, its much appreciated.

The Objetive-C code to do it is as follows:

if (certificate == nil) {

The problem is - How can I read a public key WITH passpharse in iOS?

Update 2
The communication between server and iOS app is using https
Other than https both backend and app has their public key and private key for secure communication. 
Steps for their communication:

App owns public key (with passphrase) from server
App generates a public key (with passphrase) and a private key (when app is used for first time)
when app sends data (a JSON with 3 parameters) to server, app will send a public cert generated by app (JSON parameter 1) + app generated public key passphrase (JSON parameter 2) + message encrypted by public key from server (JSON parameter 3)
Server can read the received message (decrypted by server side private key)
Server will send response message after receive a JSON. The message is encrypted by public key generated by app

So the secure connection is established from server to every single app. And ensure correct individual app won't receives message that is not intended for them. 
","RSA  encryption is an asymmetric encryption algorithm. When encrypted with the public key it can only be decrypted with the associated private key. There is no passphrase.
In general data encryption usage symmetric key encryption such as AES is used with a key that is derived from a password/phrase with PBKDF2.
In general when using asymmetric encryption the text would be encrypted with a symmetric algorithm such as AES using a random one-time key. The key would is encrypted with the asymmetric algorithm and both the symmetric encrypted text and the asymmetric encrypted key are both sent to the other end. The receiver reverses the process using the private key.
Note that asymmetric encryption is both slow and the data to be encrypted is limited to the key size. This is why it is generally used just to encrypt a key or very limited data.

Any help on this is much appreciated!.. 
","You should be ok when sending the authentication URL over SSL. SSL will authenticate the server and make sure that the data is protected against eavesdropping and man in the middle attacks. The URL will then be send over this protected channel, so after verifying the URL, the server can determine that the client is indeed the right entity. The token can then be safely send to the client over the same SSL session
If you go with your own scheme you will have to setup your own key management scheme and protocol. This is extremely hard to get right. Your comment on having access on a public key is a good indication that you will fail. SSL is not perfect either, but it has had a lot of scrutiny, and chances of it failing out of the blue are slim.
In other words, choose #2 over #1.

For the database i am using Core Data (.xcdatamodel). The encrypted text at the moment is declared as String in the data model and in the Notes.h fil,e it is declared as NSString.
For the Encryption i am using apple's sample code from CryptoExercise which works perfectly.
The problem is that when i try to save the encrypted text in the database and then decrypt it i am not getting the desired results.. basically i am getting an empty string back.
Obviously i am using the following code to convert from uint8_t to NSString so i can store it into the data model and i understand that this is my main problem.

As i said before i understand that converting uint8_t is the main problem here and i would like to know which is the correct way to do this?
Is it possible with Data Model at all, or should i go to SQLite??
","You cannot convert arbitrary bytes sequences to NSString and back like that. For example,
if data contains the single byte 128 (hex 0x80), then
NSString *string = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:data encoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding];

creates a string with one Unicode character U+0080. When you convert this back to NSData with
NSData *d1 = [string dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

then d1 will contain the bytes 0xC2 0x80 (which is the UTF-8 for U+0080). But
NSData *d2 = [string dataUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding];

does also not work (d2 = nil), because the string cannot be converted to 7-bit
ASCII.
So you should either

store the encrypted data as ""Binary Data"" in Core Data, or
store the encrypted data as String, but choose a different conversion strategy,
for example Base64.

I'm wanting to generate this token in Ruby 2.1+ and have got this far but it outputs incorrect data. I'm trying to slowly debug it, but in the meantime I'm wondering if anyone can see any obvious flaws in my process?

      cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::AES128.new(:ECB)

      cipher.encrypt
      cipher.key = private_key_digest
      encrypted_stoken = cipher.update(stoken_json) << cipher.final
      encoded_stoken = Base64.urlsafe_encode64(encrypted_stoken).gsub(/\=+\Z/, '')

","Turns out I was close. I needed to digest not hexdigest the private key:
private_key_digest = Digest::SHA1.digest(private_key)[0...16]

So the final code is:
stoken_json = hash_to_json({'session_id' => SecureRandom.uuid, 'ts_ms' => (Time.now.to_f * 1000).to_i})
cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::AES128.new(:ECB)
private_key_digest = Digest::SHA1.digest(private_key)[0...16]

cipher.encrypt
cipher.key = private_key_digest
encrypted_stoken = cipher.update(stoken_json) << cipher.final
encoded_stoken = Base64.urlsafe_encode64(encrypted_stoken).gsub(/\=+\Z/, '')

There didn't seem to be a built-in way to strip the padding from the base64 string, thus the .gsub at the end.
I also needed the timestamp in milliseconds so that part has been modified too.
In the recaptcha gem there is a method hash_to_json that I'm using, otherwise I suspect you'd use the JSON gem.

","It wouldn't be too secure since:

The private key of any user (say user B) can be leaked out of your app via injected JS code, or a bad browser addon
Once this is done, any one who gets access to any of the messages directed at User B, will be able to decrypt it and make sense of it
Of course the above wont happen if you are the only one using the app - since you'll likely have other users with different browser setups/addons/browsing-behaviors etc, it is entirely possible
When user A tries to send something to user B, you said the server will encrypt the message using user B's public key - Now, this request made via JS can be interpreted by a middle man. Once done, this middle man can initiate any request to any user by manipulating the sender, referrer etc. This can lead to impersonation and so..
You also mentioned that after generation, you intend to send the public key over to the server. This call made from JS can easily be interpreted, which means the public key can be leaked.

","To decide if something is ""secure"", you have to know what the security requirements are. Your case satisfies a few likely requirements, but there are several likely requirements that it does not satisfy. For example:

A plaintext copy of the message is apparently transmitted over the network from User A to the server, so anyone can eavesdrop on it at that point. (This is likely to be a serious problem.)
You don't explain how the public key is transmitted to the server. If it's not transmitted in an authenticated fashion, then a man-in-the-middle can generate his own public-private key pair, and give his public-key to the server. (This could be a serious problem.)
User B cannot verify the authenticity of the message (s)he receives. The message may have come from the server (and ultimately from User A), or it may have come from anyone else with a copy of the public key. (This may or may not be a serious problem, depending on the application.)

Please suggest me how can I make it work with my Android application.
Also,
OutputStream pOut = lData.open(cos, // the compressed output stream PGPLiteralData.BINARY, """", // ""filename"" to store clearData.length, // length of clear data new Date() // current time );
I am passing file name as null. Is this creating issue?
I expect Encrypted Message Without Version: BCPG v1.46, but I am getting org.bouncycastle.openpgp.PGPException: Exception creating cipher at line OutputStream cOut = cPk.open(out, bytes.length);

"6383858","Help designing a secure network protocol","In an app, I Have a network server and clients.
After a handshake, let's say the client sends ""userId sessionId SOME_COMMAND param param param"".
I have already identified the client and the sessionId is checked on the server accordingly, so identity is no more an issue.
But I'd like to prevent a hacker to modify the message or create a false one, for example sending ""userId sessionId SOME_COMMAND paramModified paramModified paramModified"".
I thought about using a pair of private/public encryption keys, and send the hash of the message in the message itself. But since it's automated in the client program, I may have to send the public key during the handshake. So the hacker could simply retrieve it and generate the proper hash.
I could also use complex encryption seeds or algorithms, but my experience with hackers has shown me that they will decompile anything.
So the bottom line is: I can hide everything that runs on the server, but I can't hide anything on the client program. And I'd like to to forbid to modify the message that the client program is supposed to send.
I don't even know if it's possible. And I'm opened to any suggestion. And by the way, I'm using Java, although it should not be very relevant. Thanks.

$ scp /home/mpiuser/.ssh/id_dsa.pub mpiuser@slave1:.ssh/authorized_keys

I still got permission denied. Also, after generating new keys, I was not able to log in using the "".pem"" key that I got from amazon.

P.S.: I can connect to each instance once it is launched and can execute any commands on them over SSH. 
","I found the solution, I added the amazon private key (.pem) in the image (AMI) that I use to create the EC2 instances and I changed the /etc/ssh/ssh_config file by adding a new identity file

I was thus wondering if it would be a good idea to store a password encrypted with the public key of public/private key encryption on the server. As decrypting is not needed, one could just throw away the secret key to avoid losing passwords when the server is compromised.
However, this method does not seem to be used widely. So are there drawbacks? If yes, then which?
","There are several drawbacks.  Among them:

You now have a token which must be protected.  If someone gets your secret key, they have every password that was encrypted with that key.  Asymmetric encryption is less of an issue if you ""lose"" the private key, but you better pray all copies of it are gone.  Hashes can't be decrypted, period.
An encrypted password can be pretty much any length, and thus would require a pretty large field in the database (or length limits for the plaintext) in order to be stored.  Hashes have a known length.
If you can decrypt the password, you know it.  If ever there was a problem with someone using that password to break into something else, everyone who knew that password belonged to that user is a suspect.  That now means you.  Even if you use one-way encryption as a hash, you'd better be able to prove you can't decrypt it -- and then, if you don't want to decrypt it, why encrypt?

Generally, you'd only choose encryption over hashing when you have to know the password for something else -- like, say, when you're using it to log in to another system on behalf of the user.  And ideally, you'd exhaust all other possibilities first.

However, this method does not seem to be used widely. So are there drawbacks? If yes, then which?
","Well there is always the drawback that computing a cryptographic hash is much less costly than encrypting a tiny password with a public-key encryption algorithm.
Secondly, you still suffer from limited entropy with public-key encryption, your bit string will still be limited. If you need more bits, use a hash with a bigger internal state (SHA-512, Whirlpool, etc...)
Third, you would need to store the public key along with the password, which results in a pretty hefty storage cost (considering how big public keys are), and if you're thinking of using the same public key for all passwords, don't - if that key is compromised it's over.
Also another consideration: without a password size limit there's a chance even padded block encryption will result in different storage sizes for different passwords, which can make database indexing a hell of a lot more difficult (probably not a huge concern but to keep in mind).
And finally, the biggie - hashes are meant to unequivocally destroy all structure in the input data, which is exactly what you want when storing passwords for verification. Encryption algorithms don't do that - they transform the data to make it unintelligible without the proper key, which sort of goes against what you're trying to use it for.
So, no, this method should not be used because it is self-defeating. Use a hash with a bigger internal state.

I assume that you mean authetication using SSL with Client Authentication. But may be you mean something else...
Anyway, Basically you need to configure SSL with Client Authentication.
Most servlet containers (like Tomcat) or Web Servers (like Apache) can do it for you.
Here's guide how to configure SSL in Tomcat. Pay attention that clientAuth should be true,

Lets start with the transfer of data.
Which is the best way to get the data from a php-page?
Option 1: Use NSString in a background thread
[[NSString alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:url];

Or Option 2: Use NSURLConnection with delegates?
Then we have the encryption part. I have google a little bit but haven't found so much. I need to be able to encrypt and decrypt on both sides (both in the iPhone app and on the php-page). What encryption is best for this? Are there any implementations of any good encryption?
And last, for key-exchange. I thinking of using diffie-hellman, which ""require"" large prime-numbers. Are there any easy way to generate such thing (on both the iPhone and the php-page)?
","Have you considered using HTTPS? SSL/TLS seems to match what you're looking for in terms of encryption, key exchange, etc. HTTP on top of this will get you to transfer data to the PHP page.

#include ""Poco/Crypto/CipherFactory.h""

I also print the text file into a string by using

","You said that you want to use public/private key algorithm so asymetric. For example RSA encryption is using PKCS#1 padding. If you use Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"") this padding is default. If decryption fails it is very probable that padding will be corrupted. In java you will get BadPaddingException.
Nevertheless I strongly suggest using hashing (even fast MD5) or simple control sum instead. Look how it is done in IPSec. IPsec uses symmetric encription (DES) and  HMAC (Message Authentication Codes using Hashing) - a mechanism for message authentication using cryptographic hash functions. Maybe, if you don't need to hide data you should use HMAC only?
I can guess that you don't need encryption, but digital signature. In fact digital signature is an encrypted (with private key) hash of a message. Verification is a decryption of this hash and comparation with computed from plaintext message.
If your provide more detail description then we can help to find the best solution.

","If you want authenticity of your data, then you could apply a MAC (Message Authentication Code) or a digital signature on your data. 
A viable solution using asymmetric public/private keys would be to wrap your data in a SignedData which then itself would be the payload of an EnvelopedData (cf. CMS).
Signature validation on your SignedData will loudly fail if somebody tampered with the contents.
If you don't want to involve asymmetric keys, another standardized way to achieve your goal is using the AuthenticatedData structure described in the same RFC. The payload would be your already encrypted data, and the MAC would additionally ensure integrity and authenticity, again failing noticeably if the contents were tampered with.
The advantage of using a standard such as CMS here is a) that libraries already exist that support these features out of the box and b) that you can rely on something that has been tested and analyzed, so you don't run the risk of creating something insecure, something that happens all too easily with these kind of things.

","I am nearly certain that any cryptographic system that is sensitive to the content (in the way that you want) will be leaking way too much info to be good encryption.
The reason we have specialized, concern specific, algorithms is (imo) precisely for this reason.  
It should be a trivial matter for you to provide an interface that includes the message digest in the (compound) plain-text and then apply encryption.  On decryption, your simple wrapper will seek a (fixed) n-byte matter (somewhere in the compound plain-text)  
e.g. encrypt this:

Or if we use https then we don't need to use this methed...??
Thanks
","If your aim is to send data from php server to client side with safety, then consider using HTTPS.
What you're trying to do instead is extremely hard to get right. If you don't use HTTPS then it's pointless because your visitors won't be able to know who they are talking to and whether the key generation and decryption code is trustworthy. If you're using HTTPS then you already send data from php server to client side with safety (using private and public keys) and encrypting it once more wouldn't do anything.
If you are trying to protect that secret from other JavaScript code running in the browser, it will still not do anything because having the private key, encryption algorithm and encrypted message in your browser is not safer than having it in clear text.
Additionally, there is a lot of room for subtle errors in key generation, key distribution, the encryption algorithm, handling the encrypted message etc. Even if you could do all of that correctly, what you would get is at most what you already have with HTTPS.
And don't think it's easy - OpenSSL with good intentions and experienced developers is probably a world record holder for the number of CVE entries because this stuff is extremely hard to get right.

        return data;
    }
}

The signature is not validating. Is there something wrong with my Java code? Maybe OpenSSL is doing something weird with dss1?
I was able to validate the signature just fine with OpenSSL:
openssl dgst -dss1 -verify dsa_pub.pem -signature sigfile.bin foo.txt

","(Unix) echo outputs its arguments, space-separated if more than one, PLUS A NEWLINE. Use ""foobar\n"" as the data to verify. Alternatively sign the result of printf '%s' foobar >foo.txt which portably omits the newline; some versions of echo support -n for this purpose, some older ones use \c, and some don't support it at all.
FYI BouncyCastle as of version 150 (2013) no longer has org.bouncycastle.openssl.PEMReader; instead you need PEMParser which returns org.bouncycastle.asn1.x509.SubjectPublicKeyInfo which can be converted to key object by org.bouncycastle.openssl.jcajce.JcaPEMKeyConverter or KeyFactory.getInstance(alg).generatePublicKey(new X509EncodedKey(spki.getEncoded())) which is what JcaPEMKeyConverter actually does. 
OTOH you can use org.bouncycastle.jcajce.provider.asymmetric.dsa.DSAUtil.generatePublicKeyParameter to replace that fiddling with the parameter pieces; that's what the BC provider interface (as opposed to the lightweight interface) does. Or of course you could just use JCA in the first place and you don't really need BC at all, since OpenSSL publickey formats (unlike privatekey) are consistently compatible with basic Java crypto.
Also BTW openssl dgst needed the -dss1 hack only through version 0.9.8; since version 1.0.0 released 2010 (but not immediately upgraded by many distros and products due to actual or feared incompatibility) you only need -sha1 and a DSA pubkey.

What does the expiration date actually mean? I have noticed it fluctuating occasionally, and have not noticed the public keys changing at the expiry time. 
I have read about Securing Your App With Signed Headers, and it goes over how to fetch the keys after every key ID mismatch, but I am looking to make a more efficient cache that can fetch the keys less often based on the expiry time.
Here are all the headers from the public keys page:

","The Expires header controls how long HTTP caches are supposed to hold onto that page. We didn't bother giving Google's content-serving infrastructure any special instructions for the keyfile, so whatever you're seeing there is the default value.
Is there a reason the ""refresh the keyfile on lookup failure"" approach isn't a good fit for your application? I'm not sure you'll be able to do any better than that, since:

Unless there's a bug or problem, you should never get a key lookup failure.
Even if you did have some scheduled key fetch, it'd probably still be advisable to refresh the keyfile on lookup failure as a fail-safe.

We don't currently rotate the keys super-frequently, though that could change in the future (which is why we don't publish the rotation interval), so it shouldn't be a significant source of load. Are you observing that refreshing the keys is impacting you?

","As described, the scheme seems reasonable in that it should allow someone to send another person a message that only the recipient can read.  There are some items that come to mind that you may have already thought about but left out for brevity:

When encrypting the private key, use something like PBKDF2 with salt and some fairly large number it iterations.
This is probably implied, but rather than encrypt with the public key, it probably makes sense to generate a random key (e.g., 32-bytes of random data if using, for example, AES-256). Encrypt the message with that key, encrypt the key with the public key, and send both pieces.
As described, there is no identification of the sender.  It allows purely anonymous messages to be sent. This might be intended, but if not, then some kind of identification/authentication would be necessary.
Somewhat similar to the previous entry, no message authentication is described. The attacker could change the encrypted message and the recipient would not be able to tell that it was changed.  Although, if it is a text message, it would be pretty clear that it had been modified, because it would be just garbled text. There are some types of data, though, that might not be so easy to tell if it had been modified.

","If I understand correctly, you want to create a system where two users can initiate private communication through a server that they do not trust.
This won't work.
In the scenario you lay out, the server can generate its own key pair, and publish its public key in place of the users'. When a user encrypts a message, intending it for their partner, they can't detect that the server has substituted its public key. The server decrypts the message, presents it to the server admins, and re-encrypts it (or some new message that they fabricated) with the real partner public key, and forwards it to the destination.
What's missing here is a certificate authority. This is a trusted third party that digitally signs a binding between a public key and a user name. This binding is called a certificate. This way, when the server presents a public key to a client to use for encryption, the client can use the CA's public key to verify the certificate, and be assured that the public key they are about to encrypt with belongs to the intended recipient, and not an attacker.
The users have to trust the CA, which might be more palatable than trusting the server administrators. But, there must also be a tamper-proof way to store the CA certificate. In practice, this is often done using a password-based MAC (message authentication code). Or, the CA could be digitally signed with the user's private key (never seen this done, but it would work). But the tricky part would be getting the CA certificate from a trusted source, bypassing the untrustworthy server.
As far as encrypting the private key with the password, that is done very often, and is as safe as the password you choose.
Alternatively, if the users can share a secret with each other out-of-band, you don't need public key encryption. The client could encrypt the shared secret with a user-selected password, and store the cipher text on the server.

","This sounds something like what hushmail did. However, there was a major problem in that, since they had the private key of the users (encrypted) they just had to push down a hacked java applet which would transmit the user's password to the server (which they did).
A much better solution is to avoid having that private key on the server at all. With the requirement of no local storage, that's out.
Why not use symmetric encryption via a pre-shared password? It can be done without storage on the client side. I believe this is what @erickson was saying in his last paragraph.

"46646327","Issues in importing a certificate to Spring","I want to hit the REST endpoints of a Server, say xyz.com. They have provided certificates in PEM format which I should be including in my application while connecting to their endpoints.
My application is written on Spring Framework and I need to convert PEM to P12 format as Spring won't accept PEM. This is how I convert:
openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.p12 -inkey private.pem -in server_cert.pem

Where,

certificate.p12 = resultant p12 file
private.pem = private key
server_cert.pem = certificate files of the server

The error I get is:

No certificate matches private key.

Now my questions:

Whose private key should be used to generate the P12 file from the PEM file? 
If the private key of client is used to generate p12, how could it possibly match with the certificate (error message becomes obvious)?
Why would I need my private key to communicate with the server? As per my understanding, during an SSL session, the private key of the client doesn't come into the picture. Or is my understanding wrong?
If the private key of the server is used to generate p12, why would they share it?

I'm a novice and therefore any links/suggested-reading/sources/answers are welcome.
","If you look at how the client-authentication works, in the 'Negotiation Phase', the second from the last point says:

The client sends a CertificateVerify message, which is a signature over the previous handshake messages using the client's certificate's private key. This signature can be verified by using the client's certificate's public key. This lets the server know that the client has access to the private key of the certificate and thus owns the certificate.

So to answer your questions:

You should be using the private-key that was given to you.
A PKCS12 is a type of Java KeyStore, which is similar to a standard JKS. It can contain a list of keypair's. But the internet standard of PKCS12 is to have only 1 key pair entry, i.e., 1 Private Key with its associated certificate-chain. Since the private key and the certificate chain were given to you as separate entities, you should be constructing the PKCS12 yourself, which you will be using in your code, to authenticate your client to the server that is providing you the service.
If you look at the steps of how the handshake happens at the protocol level, you should see that the client's private key (your private key) is used to sign some data and send to the server, where the server will be validating the authenticity of the message based on your public key. Once the server validates the message, it will come to a conclusion that you posses the private key.
You wouldn't be given servers private key. You are given your (users) private key, which you guard it and shouldn't be giving to anyone.

There might be something missing or trivial error while you are constructing with p12 with the private key and the certificate chain, which is causing to fail. If it doesn't work out, you could also construct the p12 using the KeyStore api programmatically.

I am using PGP to encrypt messages in a chat web app. After going through some articles, I get brief idea how PGP works and here is how I am doing it with openPGPJs :  

Client(web browser) generate the public/private key-pairs and send public key to server to store it.
Sender use receiver's public key to encrypt data and send it.
Receiver use their own private key to decrypt the message.

As a chat app I need to store all messages and decrypt them when user wants to see old message. decryption of messages need the private key. here the client is web browser which  neither can store the private keys for long nor can keep them safe. so I decided to store the private key on web server. Now client(web browser) asks server for the private key whenever decryption of message needed.     
Considering PGP an End to End protocol, storing private key on server is vulnerable. my question is:

How PGP encryption works for web based applications where client is not able to keep private key safe and confidential? 
Is it Okay to store private key on server?
Is there any better way to do this?

I did some debugging on the Python code: stepping into 'RSA.importKey(public_key)' I see it recognizes the key as PEM encoded key, removes the header/footer and converts it to binary (binascii.a2b_base64). The binary is passed to RSA._importKeyDER which discovers that it follows the PKCS#1 standard and, in comment, 'The DER object is an RSAPublicKey SEQUENCE with two elements'.

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong or if there's some other approach I should take to encrypting the values before it gets json encoded.
NOTE: Although I am not using the json_encode function in my code above, I believe the guzzle HTTP library json_encodes the array before sending out the request.
","As msg noted in a comment:

openssl_public_encrypt returns a binary stream, that's the mangled output, you would need to encode it in ascii first, probably with base64_encode but why do you need encryption if the transport is already using ssl ? Check with the api provider. 

However, it's also possible that they're expecting hex-encoded data instead. Give bin2hex() a try instead.
If they have some other weird format (Base32Hex?), feel free to use this RFC 4648 library to encode your messages.

Important Security Information
This isn't an answer to your question, but it is something you and your API should both be aware of.
openssl_public_encrypt defaults to RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding, which is vulnerable to a padding oracle attack.
At a minimum: The developer for the API you're communicating with should stop accepting data encrypted with RSA with PKCS#1v1.5 padding and instead only accept OAEP ciphertexts.
There are ways to work around Bleichenbacher's 1998 attack but they're messy and can only be solved at a protocol level, not a the library or primitive level.
However, RSA encryption is messy for other reasons: You can't encrypt large messages directly with RSA.
There are also plenty of other ways RSA can go wrong.
Recommendation
A better solution is to stop using RSA entirely.
Libsodium has bindings in most popular programming languages (and is included in the PHP 7.2 core) and makes this easier to get right.
// On your end...
$sendToProvider = sodium_bin2hex(
    sodium_crypto_box_seal($privateData, $publicKey)
);

// On their end...
$decrypted = sodium_crypto_box_seal_open(
    sodium_hex2bin($encrypted),
    $keypair
);

You would have encountered the encoding issue either way (since both APIs return raw binary strings). However, using libsodium would have side-stepped a ton of security issues you probably weren't aware of until you read this StackOverflow answer.
Also: Don't feel bad if you didn't know. You're not alone. Even Zend Framework's cryptography library got bit by these RSA vulnerabilities, and they had Enrico Zimuel on their team. RSA is just a bad choice for real world cryptography.

you are merely printing errors, they should be returned as well and checked
you are not checking whether the returned key is nil which can silently happen when block == nil
you should check that the unparsed portion returned by pem.Decode is empty

Use Hardware Security Modules (i.e. Amazon KMS/Vault) to having a separate server handle encryption/decryption.
Use Public Key Encryption (where the public key in database server encrypts data, and a private key is stored in separate server that solely handles decryption)

","There is no such thing as a ""reverse hash algorithm"". Any hash algorithm is designed to be one-way and implies the loss of data. If it is two-way, it is called a cipher.
As long as user is able to run your application, and the application uses those keys at some point, the keys may be leaked. This can be done through disassembling and reverse engineering, through dumping the keys from memory, or through running a debugger. So the best thing you can do is to encrypt it somehow and make it as non-obvious to decrypt as possible.
Given that you are writing it for a mobile platform, you may try to rely on some OS mechanism to protect the keys. Or, if these are the keys for some web API, you may set up a server which stores those keys and work as a proxy. Or actually ask your third-party vendor about the best practices they have for protecting the keys and for specific implementation details like suggested encryption mechanism.

some_extremely_complicated_function_which_decrypt_key(bytes);
add_some_confusing_things();
maybe_even_split_into_several_calls(bytes);
// ...
call_function_using_their_key(bytes,data1,data2,data3);

Which will result into assembler looking like this:
push [ebp+0004h]  // data3
push ecx          // data2
push [ebp+0024h]  // data1
push [eax]        // key (bytes)
call 123456h      // call to call_function_using_their_key

You will almost always be able to get address of call_function_using_their_key from import/relocation table (unless it'll be inline, obfuscated really hard or few similar techniques).
I'd simply add automatically breakpoints to every call 123456h, last push = key, key pointing to memory address 543216h, get key from 543216h. 
Any encryption was useless.
The moral of the story: first make sure that their API makes sense to encrypt data, otherwise you'll be good with this:
char *globalBytesPtr;

int main(){
    globalBytesPtr = malloc(N);
    globalBytesPtr[8] = 0x35;
    globalBytesPtr[3] = 0x14;
    globalBytesPtr[5] = 0x20;
    ...
}

Because with this your keys won't show up in static dump. This won't decrease security, because the weakest point is their API call and you cannot make application more safe in this universe.

Hello, I have searched SO for how to convert or get the String representation of a public key or private key, most of the answers were very old and only for how to convert  String pubKey =""...."";  into a key.
I tried to generate the keys and get the encoded bytes and I tried to convert the byte to String as my code shows above, but I am not sure if I am doing it in the right way by simply converting the encoded bytes into a String.
","
The Private/Public Key bytes:
byte[] theBytes = key.getEncoded();
Using new String(theBytes) is not so good, because it uses the default Charset (based on OS). Better is to pass the Charset you want (e.g UTF-8) a be consistent in that.
I would suggest to have a HEX representation of the Private/Public keys . There are multiple ways to convert a byte[] into HEX string ( Java code To convert byte to Hexadecimal ). Having the HEX format makes also the key easier to read in some UI. E.g: AA BB CC 22 24 C1 ..
Other option is Base64 format e.g:  Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(theBytes). (Java 8)

However, after reading a lot on the net, I found that one of the major flaws of public-private-key algorithms is that recorded data can be decrypted as soon as the recipients private key is leaked.
To avoid that, the use of Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) is suggested and I'm wondering, if Libsodium is already supporting PFS in the former mentioned function as individual nonces are used for each encryption.
Maybe someone can guide me on the difference between PFS and Libsodiums functions (if there are some) or help me by clarifying the relationship of nonces and PFS.
","There is no forward secrecy.
crypto_box_seal() is slightly better, as the sender uses ephemeral keys. These messages can be signed using a long-term secret key in order to check that they come from the expected party, but that key being compromised will not allow decryption of previous messages.
However, if the recipient's secret key get compromised, recorded messages can still be decrypted.
For these reasons, the box construction doesn't exist in libhydrogen. Instead, there are Noise-based protocol implementations for secure key exchange, all with forward secrecy. These APIs will be backported to libsodium at some point.
But secure chat applications are far from trivial to build. The signal library is a much better starting point, even though the license may not be compatible with your expectations.

","No. They are announcing so far a computer with 2 qubit gate scheme. This is not enough for doing anything. It's exciting news to work with this because it SEEMS to be a good environment (a full stack eco-system) to test the interfaces between classic/quantum computers, creating the API, etc... but the quantum computer with 2 qubits is not very useful in general.
About the cryptocoins, let's separate the issues: Bitcoin address is NOT the public key of the owner of the coin, but a hash of the public key. The public key is only revealed when you SPEND your bitcoins. Then you HASH you public key again (to prove that you own that address) and use you private key to sign the transactions, etc, etc...
So, EVEN IF you have a strong quantum computer, they will not break the bitcoin. HOWEVER IF you use the same address TWICE, it means, you spend some money with the address A and then make another deposit to the same address, then the public key is accessible because it was published at the time you spent the first time... then the strong quantum computer will be able to find the private key and spend your bitcoins.
I don't know about Etherium, but I assume it must be something similiar to Bitcoin... any serious cryptographic system today must prevent to be protected against quantum computers.

I would like to encrypt with PKCS #1 v1.5 padding (RSA_PKCS1_PADDING) but I can't figure out how to load the key from memory instead of a file:
void init()
{
    RSA* rsa = RSA_new();

    //what now?
    //rsa = PEM_read_RSA_PUBKEY(file, &rsa, NULL, NULL); //requires a file
}

void encrypt(unsigned char* data, int length)
{
    //can input buffer and output buffer be the same?
    RSA_public_encrypt(length, data, data, rsa, RSA_PKCS1_PADDING);
}

Also, do I need to call any cleanup code?
","You need to create bio and use functions that work with them:
BIO *mem = BIO_new_mem_buf(publicKey, -1);
RSA *rsa = PEM_read_bio_RSA_PUBKEY( mem, nullptr, nullptr, nullptr );
BIO_free( mem );
... // using rsa

error handling is ommited obviously.

Also, do I need to call any cleanup code?

Yes you always should. I would use RAII with smart pointers:
using BIO_ptr = std::unique_ptr<BIO,int(BIO *)>;

BIO_ptr createMemBio( const char *str )
{
    return BIO_ptr{ BIO_new_mem_buf(str, -1), BIO_free };
}

and so on

"16496530","Biometric locked file vault","I'm trying to create a file vault that is locked using biometrics.  Using a library like libCrypto++ seems a nice plan.  Its simple to store things in the vault as the public key can be kept in the clear.  
However the part I'm struggling with is how you convert from the biometrics to the private key.  I assume I need to store the private key somewhere but I can't figure out how.  Otherwise I run the risk of using a very secure system for file storage and then suffering from a far less secure private key.
I'm sure there must be a solution to this, I just can't think of one.
","With biometric you will never get same image or same templates. Everytime you get a new capture, you will have a different image that will supply a different template. So you can`t use it as a key to encrypt some file. You can try to take a hash code from biometric templates. Therefore this is not a good way because noise, rotation, translation and several other things that influence on biometric capture.
There are several academic articles dealing with this subject. But I yet didn`t see one that has a good way to deal with this.
The better way I saw is to use biometric devices to capture a template, match this template with a template previously saved in a database, and if you have a match, release the key kept in a database.
You need this because match of biometric data is not a byte to byte equal operation have many other things to care as I told before.

Referring back to the olden days when I used PGP, I recall a requirement to sign public keys with your Private Key. 
Is this a necessity on PKI and if so, what does this signing achieve? Is it bad practice to simply hold a list/database of people's names (and email) and their Public Key? Surely if their public key is - in any way - tampered with the encryption would fail and as you choose who you're sending or sharing the encrypted data with, even if a 'successful tamper' went unnoticed, the encrypted data wouldn't end up in the wrong hands anyway?
","The whole thing about signing a public key with a private key is useful when you have a dedicated key-pair that you use only for signing, and then other key-pairs that you use for encrypting.  This dedicated key-pair is your ""trusted"" key-pair that is somehow known to be legitimately attached to you (often by having it signed by a certificate authority or by having many trusted people sign that they have verified it's connection to you.)
You use this ""trusted"" private key to sign your not-quite-as-trusted public key.  This way, people can un-sign/decrypt your new public-key with your trusted public-key.  This is only mathematically possible if it was signed by your trusted private-key.
This process helps people to be sure that this new public-key actually belongs to you.

RSA encryption?","In iOS application i have to make user's login safe and secure and user can login from different iPhones having same application downloaded. Application should work in offline too. So which method should i implement? 
I searched and got RSA encryption in which there is private and public key method but i can't figure out how i implement it in application?whether i hold both keys in server and client side or who get which key? And how can i make only one key generation for every application downloaded? As data should roam securely between client server system.
Is there any other mechanism which i should consider implementing in my problem?
","You don't need to perform any encryption. Just store the passwords in the keychain, which has stronger encryption than anything you could possibly implement — as it's integrated into the Secure Enclave which has no public API other than keychain and already uses RSA encryption, among other things to make it even stronger than just that alone.
If the user enables iCloud KeyChain syncing, then the password you store there will be synced across all their devices.
Your application will work offline.
If the user has a weak passcode to unlock their device, then the encryption will not be very good - it can probably be cracked in under an hour (although this information is old, and may not be valid for modern hardware). The best security practice is to disable ""Simple Passcode"" and use alphabetic characters + digits. It doesn't need to be as strong password, just something short and alphanumeric is fine (the iPhone is a special case, and handles weak passwords better than most security systems). If the user has a finger print scanner available, that can be used to avoid having to type their password in regularly. This is quite secure, contrary to early reports otherwise.
If the devise has no passcode at all, then there is no encryption and it is impossible to implement protection. In that case your only option is to store your secure data on a remote server, and never ever allow the device to access it. Or else just hope nobody steals the phone. Without a passcode/password, it is impossible to store anything securely on an iPhone.
It sounds like you want a single device that will be shared by many users? If that's the case you cannot store the password on the device. It is impossible to achieve security unless there is a passcode and the passcode must be secret, anybody who knows it will be able to bypass any encryption you implement.

Example:
I have two trusted entities TA and TB, those entities should be able to alter the data that is stored in the cloud/untrusted storage, but nobody else.
So my solution I equip TA and TB with Public-Keys and i have a data structure that can be compared to a table with versions say
 Ver | Data | Signature       | Signee
  4  |  ... | (AAAAAAAAA)_TA  | TA
  3  |  ... | (ZZZZZZZZZ)_TB  | TB
  2  |  ... | (YYYYYYYYY)_TA  | TA
  1  |  ... | (XXXXXXXXX)_TA  | TA

So when I retrieve such a table from the storage provider, I can easily verify
the signatures and check whether the signature is correct, whether the signee was allowed to change the table or not.
However, I would also like to check for record completeness. Say TA uploads version 4, but TB is only aware of all records up to Version 3. Now the storage provider may withhold Version 4 completely when TB queries it. 
As there is no direct sidechannel between TA and TB, there is no way to exchange the current version. Is there a way to circumvent this?
I was thinking of periodically inserting dummy records to at least have some time certainty. However, this approach lacks scalability and would result in a lot of storage and signing overhead.
What is the actual system property i am looking for (it is hard to find research for something you do not know the name of)?
","If the problem was about record integrity, I would recommend to use MAC (Message Authentication Code). In this case you should use symmetric key cryptography, and it is much more efficient than cryptographic signatures (asymmetric).
I thought about two directions:

You can reduce your problem to record integrity. If you have specific important data that you want to verify, you can just create specific table in the storage that saves when each of the trusted entities updated each of your important variables.
Important data can be something like: number of records (total, new, according to some category), latest version, etc.
When someone does a change that affects important data, he updates the relevant record in the spacial table, and sign on the record - and the record contains also the date of the last update.
Now, to prevent the untrusted storage from returning old records or such things, each of the trusted parties must update the records at least once every some time period (for example - one day)- the records might not changed (only the date in the record), and the sign will change (now the sign is on later date).
When entity reads information, he can verify that the data is authentic and was true for (in the example) at most one day before. If the date of the returned record is older than one day, than it should not be considered.
You can change the frequency of the periodic updates according to your needs. For this option you can use MAC instead of signatures as well (to improve efficiency).
You can try another strategy: You cannot validate the completeness of every update, but you can try to catch the untrusted storage if it tries to lie! You can do it by scheduling updates and query for them. 

Last thing - You wrote: 

As there is no direct sidechannel between TA and TB, there is no way
  to exchange the current version. Is there a way to circumvent this?

I believe you meant communication channel. Side-channel is something else. If it was me, I would just create such communication channel to solve the problem. And by the way, similarly to the first option I describe, you can create such a channel:
Create a table of messages from the different entities where they announce about the important changes they did and sign about them with the date of the change:
Entity | Changes | Date | Signature (or MAC)
Like in the first option every entity must add such a message once every some predefined time period - and you have trusted communication channel between the entities.

What is the actual system property i am looking for (it is hard to find research for something you do not know the name of)?
","This problem is not fully solvable without dummy records:
Let's call the state when the current version is version 3 ""state 3"", and the state when the current version is version 4 ""state 4"". No matter how you sign these states - as long as the attacker is telling you ""state 3 is the current one"" (showing you the entire database as it was during state 3), you can't know if this is true or if state 4 exists in the meantime.
Thus, you will have to periodically sign ""no change"" updates. You won't be able to avoid the signing overhead, but you don't have to store all of these. You make a separate ""lastupdate"" table:
 Signer | Last | Timestamp | Signature
  TA    |  4   | 2013-1... | (TA;4;2013-1...)_TA
  TB    |  3   | 2013-1... | (TB;3;2013-1...)_TB

meaning ""Signer TA confirms that as of 2013-1..., the last version sent by me was 4"".
If the storage provider cannot show you a current confirmation from all signers that they didn't issue a newer version, you have to assume that he is hiding something (or something broke - either way, the data is not up to date). Any new signed statement replaces the older ones from that signer, because they are irrelevant now.
Now, if you don't have just one versioned ""thing"", but a large number of them, you don't necessarily have to have one such dummy log per ""thing"". For example, you could calculate a hash (or hash tree) over all the most current lines by your signer (e.g. ""Thing A, Version 3. Thing B, Version 7. Thing C, Version 2."") and then just put the hash or the root of the hash tree in the lastupdate table.
If you really want to avoid additional signatures, and some things get updated all the time, you could include the hash and timestamp in the signatures of the version records you sign - the most current signed record would then be sufficient proof for freshness, and if it were too old, you could still use the ""lastupdate"" table. This is not worth the complexity, IMHO.

Any ideas how I can get this unencrypted key?
","The reason that you cannot see the session key is that it is automatically decrypted and used. Normally it is considered part of the XML. If you want to get at it, just use
encryptedxml.decryptencryptedkey
And you should be alright. Note that for all the less important security warnings, the code represented here is vulnerable to both man in the middle attacks and to a lesser extend to padding oracle attacks. It should help against most eavesdropping attempts though.
Finally, reusing a session key is considered pretty bad security practice too. If you reuse it, at least consider using an IV, e.g. a counter for each followup message.

"38285575","Can I use same public key for ssh handshake and authentication?","I have an application that is distributed and installed in many machines. There is a central machine which can request other machine where the application installed and the other machines can request the central machine. So the each installation will act as a server as well as client. I want to secure the access using ssh public key cryptography.
For simplicity, let's say server A(manager - which is installed first) and server B have the application installed. 
Let's say when server B installed, server A's public key will be available in server B. 
Also assume server A will make the first request to server B. When doing so,  the server A will get server B's public key during the handshake(by verifying the fingerprint, the key will be saved in server A) and server A will send its public key to server B for authentication. As server B already has the server A's public key, authentication successful?.
When server B wants to request server A, the server A will send its public key during the handshake and it is verified against the server A's public key available in server B. For authentication, server B will send its public key which will be verified against the public key that server A got during the previous request handshake(from server A to server B).
One point to note is, there is no user involved. The application is accessible to all the users of the machine.
My query is, do we need separate keys for handshake and authentication or as I described single key is enough?
Also please let me know the above explained security model will have any issues particularly security related?
Let me know if you need more information.
Thanks,
Naga
","Yes. This is called Host-Based authentication as described in the RFC4252, section 9. But note that is poses several security threads and using proper (openssh) certificates makes much more sense these days (or Kerberos).

http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html

On client, create priv/pub key pair using ssh-keygen -t rsa
Create .ssh directory on server: ssh user@192.168.1.111 mkdir -p .ssh
Add public key to server's authorized keys: cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@192.168.1.111 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

This works. BUT, when I try either of the following methods on another computer, they both fail (Note: I tried this on two other computers and both failed):

Create a new priv/pub key pair on this second computer and just like on first computer, export the pub key to the server (This fails)
Copy the id_rsa and id_rsa.pub to the .ssh directory on the new client computer and use that (this also fails)

On both the 2nd and 3rd client it keeps asking for the remote user's password (not the password for the key file). I've now tried this on 3 different computers, and it only works on the first client I set up. No others work. Why would the server only accept the first one?
Looking in the logs, I see the following difference in the successful client and a rejected client:

The code compiles and runs fine, but has some logic errors during the verification process. I want to try using a constant key pair (that's known to be valid) to troubleshoot the program.
Using an online generator, I got an EC public key in hex,

0x044fb7cebbb1f4a1e0412c8e0b6f2d675ebfee000c5e860a81ffd795b5743033dec0e114abfba3de8db8705fc8ed985c5550c66a6ee9fdd258d058a2ef749eba78

0x0c84e7e707b31ecf0254e8cb3040513883d92d81e977ad4754a409a6ab18ee51

I can convert the hex string to a primitive byte array, but that byte array appears to be invalid. I cannot figure out how to convert a hex representation of my keys to a X509 representation so that I can make a Java key object.
KeyFactory mFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""EC"");
X509EncodedKeySpec mPublicKey = new X509EncodedKeySpec(publicKeyBytes);
PublicKey publicKey = mFactory.generatePublic(mPublicKey);

That code results in:
java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException: com.android.org.conscrypt.OpenSSLX509CertificateFactory$ParsingException: Error parsing public key

I am reasonably sure that my conversion from hex string to byte array is working, but I'll include that method as well for a sanity check.
private static byte[] hexStringToByteArray(String s) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    int len = s.length();
    if (len % 2 == 1) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Hex string must have even number of characters"");
    }
    byte[] data = new byte[len / 2]; // Allocate 1 byte per 2 hex characters
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i += 2) {
        // Convert each character into a integer (base-16), then bit-shift into place
        data[i / 2] = (byte) ((Character.digit(s.charAt(i), 16) << 4)
                + Character.digit(s.charAt(i+1), 16));
    }
    return data;
}

The end goal is to have a constant, valid PublicKey/PrivateKey object for testing. Any advice about how to generate those objects would be greatly appreciated.

                }
            }

but passing my PRIVATE KEY down instead of my PUBLIC KEY.
Then to verify the signature, I am using:

                var decrypted = Decrypt(Convert.FromBase64String(text), keySize, privateKey);

                }
            }

but passing down my PUBLIC KEY rather than the PRIVATE KEY. At this point, I am getting an error ""Key does not exist"".
I'm presuming this is the case because the PRIVATE KEY contains the relevant key information for the PUBLIC KEY so it can decode this one-way.
How can I sign a block of text in this way that allows me to distribute a signature with it, that can be decrypted by anybody who knows my PUBLIC KEY?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_token lists many expensive solutions. I need:

Strong encryption.
The ability to programmatically reset the private key on the token (multiple times, if the token is expensive) and read the new private key.
The ability to encrypt a short string (20 characters or less). I believe this means computational power can be very low.
Something cheap. I'd like to ship these tokens to average consumers (think VISA), if possible.

To protect against physical attacks on the token (I assume this is beyond the skill of the average attacker).
To kill the token remotely.
To store any data on the token aside from the private key.
Time-dependent tokens (for fear they will fall out of sync).

I plan on doing the following:

User inserts the token into a PC.
User enters their password on the keyboard.
The token encrypts the password using the private key.
The application sends the result over the network.
The server decrypts the password using the token's public key. If the password matches I let the user in.

I need to make it reasonably difficult for an average programmer/hacker to read the private key off the token. What are my options? If you believe I am setting the bar too low, what do you suggest?
","""The server decrypts the password using the token's public key""
That doesn't make sense. The point of a public key is that can be public without compromising the security of the system. Perhaps what you meant is that the token contains a public key, and the server stores the private key corresponding to that token?
Security tokens are typically not used in the manner you describe. They are quite commonly used as single sign on (SSO) devices. The token generates a pseudo-random number that is time-dependent. In most cases, the number generated changes every 30 or so seconds. The server is configured with the random seed of the token, so it can generate the same number to verify.
Edit: As per your comment, here's my new suggestion:

Public key on token or client application
Corresponding private key on server
It doesn't matter if the public key is read since knowledge of the public key does not help in guessing the private key
If necessary, change keys at scheduled intervals

","if the audience is consumers then it is quite possible that the computer they use is infected somehow - virus/keyboard logger...
IF that is a possibility then the whole scheme becomes risky because of using the PC keyboard...
Putting aside those concerns:
you could run your own ""CA"" and generate client certificates - these can be put anywhere (USB stick...) and the application could work with them for verifying the user - by just using the passphrase as password etc. - the beauty of this is: you get for example the ability to revoke certificates etc.
another point:
Depending on how your application communicates with the server you could use this scheme to have SSL connections... SSL standard contains the option not only of authenticating the server but also the client by means of a client certificate...
EDIT:
anything cheap could be read - smartcards would be better but they are not really cheap and the PC needs additional HW to handle them... 
Secure but NOT cheap option:
if you want something secure then you need an external smartcard reader with a keyboard, so that nothing sensitive it entered via PC keyboard - but that is not cheap... 
another option (cheaper but still secure):
use the mobile as second channel, they login to your app - the app contacts the server, the server generates some unique and time-limited code and sends it via SMS to their mobile and they need to enter that code to complete login process...

To get a complete test case, one can write a Java program that generates a DER public key, converts it into an uncompressed EC key (65 bytes) and outputs it to the console. It then reads the other PK from the console, converts it to a public key, and prints out the shared secret.
The Node code uses the PK from the Java program, determines the shared secret and a public key. This public key can then be passed to the Java program via copy/paste, which is still waiting for the input.
The Java program finally determines the shared secret and prints it out.
If both shared secrets have the same value, we know it works.

Node
One change is required in your node program:
In the line
public_key: public_key_client.toString('hex').slice(2), //anyone know why we drop the first byte here?

the .slice(2) needs to be removed:
public_key: public_key_client.toString('hex'),

because it removes the first byte (which is hex 04) needed to indicate that it is an uncompressed key.  
So just using the public key from the Java program (which will be different for each run) the Node part could look like this:
var publickey = Buffer.from(""<public key from java>"", 'hex');
var derived = sign(publickey);
console.log(derived);

Test

In the upper area you see the Java program and in the lower area the output of the Node program. The shared secret is the same.

","Depending on how large the string you're wanting to encrypt is - if it's larger than the modulo - it's usually best to just encrypt a randomly generated string of x bytes that serves as the key to a symmetric algorithm and then use that symmetric algorithm to encrypt the ""large string"".
eg. encrypt a 16 byte (128 bit) key for AES and then encrypt the ""large string"" not with RSA but with AES and append it to the RSA encrypted AES key.
Or you could use a larger modulo, too, but the larger the modulo the more time it'd take to perform encryption / decryption.

What is happening is I am using a public key to encrypt a text file, which is then being transmitted to a third party.  When they attempt to auto-decrypt the file at their end (using Globalscape - not sure of the version), the process fails, asking for a passphrase to unlock the secret key.
If I do the same process, but encrypt the file using GPG4Win with the same key, they are not getting the same issue.
This is the code doing the encryption:
private static bool EncryptFile(Stream outputStream, string fileName, PgpPublicKey encKey, bool withIntegrityCheck)
        {
            try
            {

                encryptedDataGenerator.AddMethod(encKey);

                using (var cOutStream = encryptedDataGenerator.Open(outputStream, bytes.Length))
                {
                    cOutStream.Write(bytes, 0, bytes.Length);

I admit I am a little lost here.  Can anyone point out what I am missing?  Or should I be asking the third party to dig further?

","This is more a high level approach  to pin down the underlying problem:
You are encrypting with a Public Key. That means the recipient needs the matching Private Key.
It looks like the recipient has the key because else the client should complain about a missing private key, not about a missing passphrase for the key.
Check the following (from easy to not so easy)

Can the recipient decrypt when he enters the passphrase? If yes, configure the client to save the passphrase.
Try to decrypt with your local gpg
Are you sure that the client has the private key? If not, make sure that the client has the private key (Maybe you use different keys with your Code and gpg4win)
Can the client handle the encryption method at all? I.e. does the client know how to decrypt the message format you send?(""did it ever work?"" - I have no experience with Globalscape)

So I tried making RSA encryption in Snap. I realize snaps computing limitations but wanted something a small as 1 bit or 2 bit encryption to work. My code can be found on this webpage.
The code however does not work and I wanted to know if it was because my understanding of RSA was wrong or I missed a step in RSA. My end goal is for my code to be able to encrypt any text in 1 or 2 bit RSA.

So I need to encrypt the responses to reduce the chances of someone getting the data that shouldn't have it.
My plan is that the user will identify themselves with a user ID, a public key, and the name of a query they want to run (which they will have defined in the system itself beforehand) - and the request will take a form something like this:

Assuming the above user ID and public key were a match, and the query existed and returned data - I was going to have my system encrypt the response to a private key which is known to the user ($myPrivateKey) and which is known to my system, but never exchanged between the two in a request so that it couldn't be intercepted, and I was going to use something like this reversible encryption class to do the encryption.
The problem is, I'm going to have to provide users with the decryption class so that they can get the data out of the response.
So if Mr Malicious somehow obtains a user ID and public key belonging to someone else, and he has downloaded a copy of the decryption class from the tutorial/user manual on my systems website, am I right in saying that he wouldn't need to know the private key, because he could just work out how to decrypt it from studying the code?

","Mr Malicious wouldn't know how to decrypt anything from simply studying the code. The best he could do would be to brute force the ""private key"".  
I put that in quotes because this actually isn't public key encryption or cryptography.  This would only be public key cryptography if your server encrypted the data using the client's public key, then the client decrypted that using their private key.  If that were the case, the server would have no need to know the private key at all. But it sounds like you're using the public key for something entirely different.
What you seem to be talking about here is symmetric key cryptography (using the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data).
If you use a strong encryption / decryption method, your method seems fine, but I would go with an existing algorithm such as Blowfish or AES.

","A good encryption method never relies on people not knowing how it works for its security. In fact, if you're going to use encryption, you never want to try and make your own. If the method used to encrypt something is simple, like ROT13, then yes, knowing the method will allow an attacker to decrypt it pretty easily. 
However, an encryption method like AES is widely known, published, and used all over the world. Everyone knows how it works, but without knowing the keys used to encrypt and decrypt, it's hard to break.
The biggest issue that you have is that both the encryption class that you linked, and AES are symmetric or pre-shared key encryption methods. This means that you must use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data. This doesn't work for your purposes, because you and your users don't know the same key. If you have a way to know the same key, check out mcrypt for PHP
Otherwise, use asymmetric key cryptography. This works using the method you described, where something can be encrypted using a public key that anyone can know, but only decrypted by the person with the private key. The easiest version of this to use is GPG, and it's possible to use it in PHP, although probably more work to setup. See this article

The scheme I think would work is as follows:

The device will request authorization with it's ID.
The server finds the public key of the device by the provided ID and encrypts a random string.  The string is sent to the device.
The device receives the encrypted string and decrypts it with its private key, sending the result back to the server.
The server checks the string to make sure it matches and sets the correct session variables for the device if the check was correct.

All of this is over an SSL connection, so step 3 can't be snooped and used to authenticate again.  Some devices will not need this type of authorization, so the SSL connection can't just verify that the public key of the device was generated by the server's certificate authority and close the connection if it was not.
First of all, does this make sense, or is there a better way?  And second - is there some gem that already does this in rails?  It seems like this would be a somewhat common method of doing things.

public byte[] encrypt(byte[] data, RSA_PublicKey publicKey) {
   BigInteger message = new BigInteger(data);
   BigInteger n = publicKey.getModulus(); //RSA Modulus
   BigInteger e = publicKey.getPublicExponent(); //RSA Public Exponent
   if (message.compareTo(n) >= 0) {
       throw new InvalidDataException();
   }
   byte[] cipherText = message.modPow(e, n).toByteArray(); //Encryption
   return cipherText;
}

public byte[] decrypt(byte[] data, RSA_PrivateKey privateKey) {
   BigInteger cipherText = new BigInteger(data);
   BigInteger n = privateKey.getModulus(); //RSA Modulus
   BigInteger d = privateKey.getPrivateExponent(); //RSA Private Exponent
   if (cipherText.compareTo(n) >= 0) {
       throw new InvalidDataException();
   }
   if (cipherText.compareTo(n.subtract(BigInteger.ONE)) == 1) {
       throw new InvalidDataException();
   }
   byte[] message = cipherText.modPow(d, n).toByteArray(); //Decryption
   return message;
}

In RSA-OAEP, a series of operations are performed on the data and a random seed using a mask generation function before encryption. A zero byte is placed in front of the padded data. This is what it looks like in my code:
buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(k);
buffer.put((byte)0);
buffer.put(maskedSeed);
buffer.put(maskedDB);
byte[] em = buffer.array();
byte[] cipherText = encrypt(em, publicKey);
return cipherText

When I decrypt this ciphertext, sometimes the zero byte is still in the resulting byte array, and other times it is not. For example, this data (in hex) was the same before encryption and after decryption:
00c127a743b56f53e46223eba367b63d3378648c1d5ce3e8eec1f714c099a15b674c528d5051c1c9a32dc39fb13ee745864c7f572fa950dc8336a54d89503754f6c18dd463ec1633e6e94638230d9b10cc6e2904f4c69247a8bac0c60885b37b8adefe3b682b3a6d39f445447fa2f173b408346d3d0db086e199ef9c1fd0d14f
However, this data:
001c924b794c178c9955d4f3211c67ecda59ffe8c4be55c101bcd5ff3ce0a746ca447b5fc8fd8725cbb083e4b9244cf49b6ca84465680c0c49bec2bab3dfab6371673f0d01605d641330592ffb8915229c2dc4ea1ffcdf8a9a0e461fdf224f5cf57f74affac9d35dd3ce61ff1dd068a8c9495290735415984ddb71515823f746
was decrypted as this:
1c924b794c178c9955d4f3211c67ecda59ffe8c4be55c101bcd5ff3ce0a746ca447b5fc8fd8725cbb083e4b9244cf49b6ca84465680c0c49bec2bab3dfab6371673f0d01605d641330592ffb8915229c2dc4ea1ffcdf8a9a0e461fdf224f5cf57f74affac9d35dd3ce61ff1dd068a8c9495290735415984ddb71515823f746
According to the RSA standard, the decrypted padded data is supposed to be checked for this zero byte to ensure it is properly padded, and to return an error message if it is not. I believe this has something to do with the fact that BigIntegers are signed. Is there some workaround for this issue?
","new BigInteger(data) always parses the data in two-complement notation where the most-significant bit signalizes the sign. In RSA, all numbers are positive, so you can set the sign as 1: 
new BigInteger(1, data)

","When using the RSA algorithm, the plaintext size cannot be larger than the modulus of the key. For example, a 2048-bit RSA key cannot operate on plaintext that is larger than 2048 bits (or 256 bytes).
This restriction also needs to consider padding, which normally adds several bytes. For example, PKCS#1 padding typically adds at least 11 bytes to the plaintext, meaning the largest plaintext is then 245 bytes (or smaller).

","As @WizKid commented, the encryption you are suggesting in the question is exactly what HTTPS is doing.
HTTPS uses signed certificates that are pre-installed in your browser or devices, provided by trusted third-party certificate authorities, to validate the identity of the website and the associated servers. This would prevent website phishing and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
The communication between the users and the web server is encrypted by Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Socket Layer (SSL), so your exchanged data is protected by MITM attacks.
As HTTPS relies on trusting the signed certificate, you could decrypt the data using Fiddler because Fiddler asked you to add a self-generated certificate to trust. Without your permission, your data would be safe.

","The android IRC group was very helpful. 
I was making a mistake of converting bytes array into a string, using toString() . When we convert the byte array (or byte[]) into a string using toString(), we print the start address of the object. So actually [B@xxxxx is actually the address of the byte array (the xxxx part), while I was confusing them to be the actual contents of the array.

valid: false

As you can see, the verification fails, but I am pretty sure the signature is valid as this timestamp server is used by many people.
Is there anything wrong with my implementation?
I try to do this inside of an Firefox extension.
Edit: It seem that it is required to use the DER value of the signedAttrs field, hash it and then verify it with the certificate.
","I managed to do it myself: You first have to decrypt the signature with the public key to get a ASN.1 object that contains the message digest.
e.g. openssl rsautl -inkey cert.pem -pubin -in signature -out out

Then you take the signedAttrs object and replace the explicit tag at the beginning (0xA0) with the set tag (0x31) because of the following sentence in the RFC:
The IMPLICIT [0] tag in the signedAttrs is not used for the DER encoding, rather an EXPLICIT SET OF tag is used

Then you calculate a digest (with the same algorithm as in digestAlgorithm in signerInfo) of the set object.
The two digest values are the same if the signature is valid.

","HTTPS does not have headers of its own. It simply uses an encrypted ""tunnel"" to send regular HTTP requests. AFAIK sending the same cleartext twice over SSL/TLS does not necessarily send the same data each time.

","Random numbers are generated in Javascript by the amount of milliseconds since 1st of January 1970(UNIX Timestamp). Then Javascript just takes the first few values and that is your random number. i.e.

","Yes it matters. If an attacker generates random numbers at the same time as a genuine user, they can predict what is generated and retrieve they key. Even if the clocks aren't fully synchronised, an attacker could generate a range around the UNIX timestamp when the key was known to have been generated and then try each one in turn.
Solution: Use window.crypto to generate a secure random number using the crypto library.

The Crypto interface represents basic cryptography features available
  in the current context. It allows access to a cryptographically strong
  random number generator and to cryptographic primitives.

Let's say a higher level user can decrypt messages encrypted by lower level users. 
Is it something possible ? I guess it is only possible to do with hierarchical 
key management, like the higher level users have access to the lower level user's keys. 
Any other option to do something like this ? 
","What I'd propose is, to some extent, an extension of your hierarchical key management idea.
Here's the core idea:
We use a cryptographically-strong random secret to encrypt the file symetrically (public-key-encryption of large datasets is actually quite slow, so most software like GPG uses a symmetric block cipher to encrypt the data, then they public-key-encrypt the random secret.). The random secret itself is encrypted with the key of each user that is allowed to access the data.
This scheme is similar to when you send a PGP message to multiple receivers. It's quite simple, but the problem is you have to update any encrypted data if users are added, modified or removed. Generally you can introduce intermediary keys to counteract this effect.
In order to address these issues, cryptographers invented HIBE (Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption). If you want to use this in a real application, please don't build the crypto stack yourself, but use proven, peer-reviewed algorithms.

cat table2 >> table

","You should retrieve the data on your remote server and then process the data on your computer. Here is one of the solution :
mem_check Variable User Server
{
    mem=`ssh $3@$2 ""df -h /tmp --output=pcent | grep -v Use | cut -d '%' -f 1""`
    echo $1 >> table
    echo $2 >> table
    echo $3 >> table
    if [ $mem -ge 80 ]; then
        echo -e ""$mem% \n<font style=\""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #FF0000\"">R</font>\n"" >> table
    else
        echo -e ""$mem% \n<font style=\""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #33cc33\"">G</font>\n"" >> table
    fi
}

I have changed command to retrieve space because df has a built-in fonction to format output so you don't need to awk. Also I think that with df, -k option is useless while using -h option.
You can see I also delete process about HOSTNAME and USER because you already gave it to ssh command.
Using your script you can do this :
mem_check Variable User Server
{
    ssh $3@$2 a1=$1 'bash -s' <<'ENDSSH' >> table
    echo $a1
    echo $HOSTNAME
    echo ${HOME//home/} | tr -d / | sed ':a;N;s/\n/ /g'
    mem=$(df -kh /tmp | grep -vE '^Filesystem|cdrom' | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d '%' -f 1 )
    if [ $mem -ge 80 ]; then
        echo -e ""$mem% \n<font style=\""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #FF0000\"">R</font>\n""
    else
        echo -e ""$mem% \n<font style=\""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #33cc33\"">G</font>\n""
    fi
    ENDSSH
}

This will redirect all of the ssh output in your local file.

"55341115","How to generate RSA public key from private key?","I was reading a question on SO and find out that we can generate the public key from private key using openssl in python. Now I wonder how this works(the mathematics part) and  how can I implement the method in python or in C, without using the openssl or any other library ?
","If the private key is stored in CRT format (Chinese Remainder Theorem), there is no math involved; the format includes the public exponent. This is how OpenSSL tools ""create"" a public key from a private key.
If the private is not stored in CRT format, it's generally not feasible to compute the public exponent given the private exponent. You can, however, guess common public exponents and easily verify your guess.
Mathematically, in order to quickly compute one exponent using the other, you need to know the totient, a number computed from the factors of the modulus. And of course the security of RSA is predicated on the infeasibility of factoring the modulus. This relationship is symmetrical; it doesn't matter whether you know the public exponent and try to compute the private exponent, or vice-versa.

Do SSL certs contains keys inside them? If so, which ones (public or private)?
If so, why is it necessary for the SSL cert to contain the key(s)?
Is there a notion of ""public"" vs ""private"" certificates like there is with keys?

","A digital certificate ""contains"" a public key, along with some other information.  The other information often includes a host name, and the certificate may be digitally ""signed"" by certificating authority.  Digital certificates do not contain private keys.
Certificates contain public keys because the purpose of the certificate includes providing the public key to clients.
Since certificates don't contain private keys, there is no notion of ""public"" versus ""private"" certificates.

"52797337","How to generate entropy by myself? - RSA Golang","I'm working with Golang's RSA encryption library. The following is the function to encrypt a message:
func EncryptOAEP(hash hash.Hash, random io.Reader, pub *PublicKey, msg []byte, label []byte) ([]byte, error)

The random parameter is used as a source of entropy to ensure that encrypting the same message twice doesn't result in the same ciphertext. This parameter allow to use linux functions like getrandom(2) if available or /dev/urandom otherwise that serves as a random number generator by accessing environmental noise collected from devices and other sources. I don't want the EncryptOAEP function to use the functions of the operating system (getrandom(2) or /dev/urandom) to generate the random number. I need to generate a random number by myself (that is, outside the EncryptOAEP function) and then insert it into it. Is that possible with this library? In case it is not, what Golang's library could I use to achieve this behavior? I hope I was clear enough, any help will be appreciated, thanks!
","By design, it is possible and it is easy to do. Provide any io.Reader as the random argument.

    // rng := rand.Reader
    // However, you can use any io.Reader.
    // For example, math/rand.Reader
    rng := rand.New(rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano()))

    ciphertext, err := rsa.EncryptOAEP(sha256.New(), rng, &test2048Key.PublicKey, secretMessage, label)

","Sure. You can factor the modulus, altho for real world RSA keys, that's not gonna be very practical.
More seriously, 99% of all RSA keys use 65537 as the exponent. If a common public exponent were a weakness 99% of all RSA applications would be vulnerable.

It can cost quite a bit of money to enable SSL with cloud hosting platforms, registrars, etc.
Whatever private keys our browsers use for their typical SSL behavior should be accessible to a javascript app running in that browser, no?
The ideal situation would be to encode information within Javascript so that, on the backend server, in some backend framework, it was indistinguishable (from a developer's perspective) from standard browser-implemented SSL.
SO has some posts about it, but none of them are very recent. This SO post has perspectives from 2011 through 2014, and this SO post from circa 2013.
If someone built something that did this in Javascript, then, for example, ideally, an Angular app could incorporate it by putting something in app.config() regarding $routeProvider or $httpProvider

The fact is that openssl only accepts PEM (as far as I've seen). How do I convert this key into something openssl can use to encrypt?
","
but it's in XML format

The presentation format is RFC 3275, XML-Signature Syntax and Processing.


How do I convert this key into something openssl can use to encrypt?

You will need to parse the RFC 3275 RSAKeyValue, then put it in an OpenSSL RSA structure.
Its somewhat painful.... are you sure you want to see it? (The XML parsing is left as an exercise to the reader, but it uses the values you provided above).

How to encrypt in linux using an xml public key

With the RSA from above, try RSA_encrypt (and RSA_verify). See rsa(3) in the OpenSSL docs.

Then invoke RSACryptoServiceProvider.FromXmlString(publickey)

amazingly this key could be recognized by RSACryptoServiceProvider.FromXmlString
I didn't see much difference between the former one and the latter one, why does error occur in the first case?
Is there any other way to restore the public key given modulus and exponent?
","You received a hex (base 16) version of the integer modulus and public exponent. You then converted that base 16 version into base64. However, the XML is supposed to contain the base64 encoding of the integers as byte arrays in big-endian format. You can easily do that from the hex by converting every two hex characters into its byte value. The result should look something like

","If you want to be super-secure, using the cryptographically secure random number generator would work. And converting to hex is the easiest way to ensure it's URL-safe:
byte[] bytes = new byte[8];
using (var rng = RandomNumberGenerator.Create())

    rng.GetBytes(bytes);
}
string key = string.Join("""", bytes.Select(b => b.ToString(""X2"")));

Signal Protocol
OMEMO and XEP-omemo

Regarding Ejabberd - as stated here https://www.process-one.net/en/ejabberd/protocols/ - they support OpenPGP out of the box. 
Other things (at least OTR) also can be used in any messaging apps.

-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

","Let me first briefly describe your target format. What you are seeking to obtain is a PEM encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo (SPKI) file. PEM encoding is essentially DER encoding (which is a binary format) and then base64 encoded with a header and footer. The SPKI structure is defined in RFC5280 (see section 4.1):
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.1
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
        algorithm            AlgorithmIdentifier,
        subjectPublicKey     BIT STRING  }

So the first chunk of bytes in the binary DER encoding consists of a header that identifies the algorithm being used (and part of that includes the curve). The last bytes are the raw public key (which is an encoded x and y co-ordinate on the curve).
Since your sample key is for the same curve as the key you want to create it will have the same AlgorithmIdentifier header bytes. Taking your mykey.pub file we can convert it to the binary DER format:
$ openssl ec -in mykey.pub -pubin -outform DER -out key.der

Lets look at the contents:
$ hexdump -C key.der
00000000  30 59 30 13 06 07 2a 86  48 ce 3d 02 01 06 08 2a  |0Y0...*.H.=....*|
00000010  86 48 ce 3d 03 01 07 03  42 00 04 4c 65 30 a3 03  |.H.=....B..Le0..|
00000020  44 7e a4 34 2e d1 e2 31  72 4f 63 e3 ac e6 95 dc  |D~.4...1rOc.....|
00000030  96 c6 02 44 f3 a2 dc 5e  8a d2 7e 24 d5 18 c9 ec  |...D...^..~$....|
00000040  f1 a9 ff d4 61 67 2d d7  4b 5c a7 d5 09 6e e2 1a  |....ag-.K\...n..|
00000050  02 0a 51 dc 73 da cf 5c  f9 f8 7d                 |..Q.s..\..}|
0000005b

You can see the first bytes of the public key that you printed out above starting at offset 0x1a (i.e. 26 bytes in): 04 4c 65 30 .... The raw public key data extends all the way the end of the file and is 65 bytes long. This consists of a leading 0x04 byte followed by 32 bytes of x co-ordinate and 32 bytes of y co-ordinate. The leading 0x04 tells us how the co-ordinate is represented. 0x04 means ""uncompressed"" - which is handy because that's the simplest for us to deal with. We will also use uncompressed format for our target key. Therefore we need to take the first 26 bytes of header plus the 0x04 byte (so 27 bytes in total) from our sample key:
$ head -c 27 key.der >key.head

And just to check we got what we were expecting:
$ hexdump -C key.head
00000000  30 59 30 13 06 07 2a 86  48 ce 3d 02 01 06 08 2a  |0Y0...*.H.=....*|
00000010  86 48 ce 3d 03 01 07 03  42 00 04                 |.H.=....B..|
0000001b

Now we create the x and y elements of our co-ordinate, which you already did:
$ echo -n ""GCl++lQHb7NKYU3jXpKVI/BYaTlALT5JFPdl3sbB9mY="" | base64 -d >key.x
$ echo -n ""ADRX25PBSlZJE79drET0ARtRqZAkUIMNt9aa2bbjBYY="" | base64 -d >key.y

And then put all the elements together:
cat key.head key.x key.y >keynew.der

We can convert the new key in DER format to PEM format:
$ openssl ec -in keynew.der -inform DER -pubin -out keynew.pem

Which gives us:
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

LT5JFPdl3sbB9mYANFfbk8FKVkkTv12sRPQBG1GpkCRQgw231prZtuMFhg==

And just to check it looks sane:
$ openssl ec -in keynew.pem -pubin -noout -text

","I'm not sure stunnel is what you're looking for here.
What you describe would be best accomplished with OpenSSH, and its dynamic SOCKS5 proxy functionality, e.g. ssh -D1080 from the client.
This generally doesn't require any extra settings on the server-side (unless it was specifically disabled by your system administrator), and then on your roaming client-side, you simply establish an SSH connection to your server as per usual, but add an extra -D1080 parameter to your ssh invocation.
Or, if using PuTTY, set up dynamic port forwarding within Connection, SSH, Tunnels, Source port of 1080 and Destination of Dynamic, click Add.
Subsequently, change the settings of your browser to use SOCKS proxy at localhost, port 1080, and also make sure to specify SOCKS v5 and ensure that the checkbox for resolving hostnames remotely is set, too.

","If you have a file that just says ""yes, software may be run"" you can of course not stop him from copying that file.
What you can do is to encrypt a file with something that is specific to the customer's system, the customer's name or an IP address or something. Then you can make your software check this IP address or print the customer's name on all reports or something.
You can do it with simple symmetric encryption or using a signature, neither of them preventing him from tampering with the program to find the key. So tell your boss it's an obstacle but certainly not unbreakable.

","Simple RSA encryption will not solve your woes, once the code is in the clear anyone can get it.  
A better question is ""How much work am I willing to put into making it difficult for my client to get my code?""  As no matter the language and method eventually it gets run, and when it's run it can be read.

","You can use a license like FlexNet Publisher License System.
There are two sides to the FlexNet license. The first is establishing that a site has a license. This can be done based upon IP, Mac Address, or an internal ID of the processor.
Once you've licensed the site, licenses at that site can be done on an active user basis (you can have thousands of users, but only ten users at a time can use the software), seat license (you have ten users at the site who can use it, and only those people can use it. If an eleventh person wants it, the site must move the license from one person who is licensed to that new user. Or, buy more licenses). And, you can have a site license with unlimited users.
FlexNet license can be broken, but are generally strong and can report back to you violations of the license policy.
Of course, you'll have to pay a licensing fee to Flexera Software to use their licensing scheme. And, there may even be some sort of ""open source"" implementation of the FlexNet licensing scheme although I don't know of one.
I've never used it because I believe fully in the open source software philosophy. That and the fact than no one would pay a cent for anything I wrote.

","It sounds like what you are looking for is a digital signature.
When you create the license file, you sign it using your private key.  When the application loads the license file, it verifies the signature using your public key, which is hardcoded into your obfuscated license check.
Obviously, the user can just patch the license check code itself - either to replace your public key with their own, or just to avoid the license check altogther - but there's really nothing you can do about that.

"26536374","Asymmetric encryption with multiple decryption results","Edit
I am trying to develop a password managing tool for companies. My idea is that the passwords in some kind of database are encrypted with a master password which only the admin has.
Per department in a company there should be an own password, which lets the users of that department only access their passwords.
Lets look at an example.

Department A

Billing system, Password: ""Hello""

Department B

Mail, Password: ""World""


The passwords are encrypted with the master password of the admin. Lets just assume it is 0000. So in the database there would be something like this

Department A

Billing system, Password: encrypt(""Hello"",0000,'A')

Department B

Mail, Password: encrypt(""World"",0000,'B')


Furthermore, the password of department A would be 9999 and of department B 7777. Now I am searching for a possibility to decrypt the password of the billing system with the password 9999 and decrypt the mail password with 7777. But it should not be possible to decrypt the mail password with 9999 and vice versa.

Billing system: decrypt(encrypt(""Hello"",0000,'A'), 9999) = ""Hello""
Billing system: decrypt(encrypt(""Hello"",0000,'A'), 7777) != ""Hello""
Mail: decrypt(encrypt(""World"",0000,'B'), 9999) != ""World""
Mail: decrypt(encrypt(""World"",0000,'B'), 7777) = ""World""

Not that this it hard enough, the admin user must have the possibility to decrypt any password with his master password 0000

Billing system: decrypt(encrypt(""Hello"",0000,'A'), 0000) = ""Hello""
Mail: decrypt(encrypt(""World"",0000,'B'), 0000) = ""World""

I hope that my ideas are getting clearer now...
","Preface: you cannot design a cryptographic system without knowing its full intent and purpose, so me giving any snippet of advice may be wholly unsuitable for your eventual end goal. Also, you may rather want to ask the experts at http://security.stackexchange.com or http://crypto.stackexchange.com. Also, I have more of a general knowledge of cryptography and this is a general programming forum, so take the below with a grain of salt.

Having said that, the usual way to store one piece of information in an encrypted form but make it accessible to multiple parties using different passwords is to use intermediate encryption keys. You have your plaintext. You generate a random key and use that to encrypt the plaintext. You now encrypt the randomly generated key with the user's personal password and store the result.
plaintext  = 'Hello World'
key        = make_random_string(128)
ciphertext = encrypt(plaintext, key)
keys = {
    user1: encrypt(key, user1password),
    user2: encrypt(key, user2password),
    ...
}

To decrypt, you use the user's password to decrypt the key to then decrypt the actual information.
key       = decrypt(keys.user1, user1password)
plaintext = decrypt(ciphertext, key)

print plaintext

This indirection allows you to share the same piece of information among several users. In practice you'd probably use symmetric encryption to encrypt the plaintext with the random key, and asymmetric encryption to encrypt the random key with each user's public key. That means in practice, every time you generate a new random symmetric encryption key, the system needs to create a copy of it individually encrypted with each user's public key that should have access to it.
This also allows you to irretrievably revoke an individual user's access to a specific piece of information, simply by nuking that users version of the random encryption key.

There seems to be a loss (or an addition??) somewhere between the client and the server, related to padding. But for the life of me, I have no idea what it could be.
I suspect the way the encryption is done client-side could be the culprit, as when done locally, everything works flawlessly.

"34778931","How to use asymmetrical encryption to receive data in javascript?","I understand the concept of asymmetrical encryption in the context of the client wanting to send data securely to the server. The server sends a public key to the client that is used to encrypt the data. The server decrypts the message using it's private key. In this context, everything makes sense, since the private key is only accessible by the server.
But what if the client wants to receive data securely? The same concept could apply in the opposite direction (the front end shares the public key and possess the private key), except the private key would be available to anyone, since the source code in javascript is available in the web browser and it would defeat the purpose of encryption...
Surely there is a solution for this. When searching I have not found a clear answer to my question, although many people mentioned HTTPS. I would also like to know why and how does it work and where my knowledge is flawed.
How does a client securely receive data from a server?
","As you have already mentioned, HTTPS is the solution here.  You have already covered how this works but you are just missing a few key details.
HTTPS use asymmetric encryption to establish the initial encrypted communication.  Subsequent communication is actually performed using symmetric encryption as it is more performant and more secure for a smaller key size.  So the initial hand shake uses the server's public key to exchange a shared secret key that both the server and client will then use for all communication.
Additionally, the public key used by the server is generally signed by a trusted certificate authority whose key your browser already knows.  This allows your web browser to verify the server's public key so that you know that the communication has not been intercepted and altered by an attacker sitting between you and the server.  Otherwise an attacker could just intercept all communication and send you a different public key claiming to be the server's public key, and how would you know the difference?
Once the encrypted channel is established, anything the client sends to the server is encrypted, and likewise, anything the server sends to the client is encrypted.  The encryption guarantees here ensure both confidentiality and integrity of all communication.
So by using HTTPS, the client is securely receiving data from the server, as well as securely sending data to the server, all without embedding any keys directly into the Javascript code.

How does a client securely receive data from a server?
","SSL is just another layer of security (at least to some extent). Any CA is not inherently secure. You may want to use PKI along with the usual symmetric algorithms like this (a sample usage), where (depending on the data size - PKI serves to encrypt small data chunks) the public key encrypts preliminarily generated symmetric key (which encrypts some data) on the sender side and the private key on the receiver side decrypts the symmetric key (which on its turn decrypts the data).

"44581184","Why does Spring's default OAuth JWT implementation make the JWT verifier public?","Spring's default OAuth JWT flow (using client_credentials grant) is as follows:

Launch the Auth Server (AS)
Launch the Resource Server (RS)


At startup the RS requests the tokenKey by calling GET /oauth/token_key using Basic Auth

The AS returns a PUBLIC KEY using RS256 (SHA256withRSA)
Some time later, the Client requests an accessToken by calling GET /oauth/token using the client_credentials grant
The AS returns a JWT accessToken containing a JWS signature
The Client sends the JWT as a Bearer token to the RS
The RS uses the tokenKey that it received from the AS at startup to verify that the JWT accessToken came from the AS. This is where I get confused...

Is this secure? Why would a public cert be used rather than a shared secret key? Couldn't a hacker easily obtain the public key and sign their own valid JWT accessToken? How does the usage of the public key cert and the JWT signature work together to verify that the sender was actually the Auth Server and not an attacker?
Any insight would help.
","Some research into the nature of public key cryptography and digital signatures gleans this: 
Digital signatures implement asymmetric cryptography. A digital signature gives the receiver reason to believe the message was sent by the claimed sender. Similar to a handwritten signature they are difficult to forge. The signer, in this case, the AS, uses a secret PrivateKey to create the signature. Some non-repudiation schemes offer a time stamp for the digital signature, so that even when the PrivateKey is exposed, the signature is valid.
A digital signature scheme typically consists of 3 algorithms 
1) A key generation algorithm that selects a PrivateKey uniformly at random from a set of possible private keys. The algorithm outputs the private key and a corresponding public key.
2) A signing algorithm that creates a signature using the message and the private key
3) A signature verifying algorithm that, given the message, PublicKey and signature, either accepts or rejects the message's claim to authenticity.
In this case (RS256), the signature was created using SHA256withRSA which is not used as an encryption algorithm, rather it is used to verify the origin or the authenticity of the data.  The signature was generated using a private key. The public key is passed to the Resource server to be used to verify the signature. In this scenario, even if an attacker has the PublicKey, they cannot create a spoof message with the signature or alter the contents.

I want Nginx to serve these encrypted files with random access.
First question: Is it possible at all? (for the authorization part I'm all ears to know if there's any solution, my authentication and authorization is done in Django, session keys stored in postgre, but I have no idea if it's feasible to share it with nginx.) Can a lua plugin for nginx read session data from postgre (or redis) and do the authorization checks with good performance?
Second question: How?
One possible solution I though about is using different certificate files (generated with passwords by django) to serve files as https. But I have no idea if it's possible to use different certificate files dynamically generated based on URI or not and I have no idea if nginx can serve files with asymmetric encryption over https or if https protocol supports it at all even if client is a custom client other than normal browsers than can parse data whatever way needed.
Another possible solution is writing a Lua plugin for Nginx but that'd be extremely expensive solution for me considering my resources. But I'd be thankful if someone could tell me if it's possible at all even with a custom plugin or not.

What I achieved
I learned to hash and encrypt/decrypt data using bCrypt but I don't understand what steps I have to do to achieve what I wrote before
","You have to change the design. Currently you design has a major security flaw. You got the concepts of the pubkey/prikey correct, but the implementation is incorrect. The private key should be kept private. Currently it is easy to derive the public key, given the private key for a lot of algorithms, but not the other way around. The right design is as follows.

Generate a self-signed certificate. This certificate will contain private and public key
Export the public certificate and embed it as resource/or hardcode it in your application that you are going to distribute
The application will then hash the data to be signed and use the public key from the application resource.
This hashed data is then sent over the http to your server that has the copy of private key.
The server will hash the data and verify the hash with the private key.

All of the above steps are well documented with samples on MSDN. If you need further help, let me know and I can point it to the articles.
The above design will make sure that your private key is never in the wild. If you distribute your private key in your application, it will take literally only few minutes to get your private key.
Storing the public key in the application is just the matter of either hardcoding the key in the application using byte array or putting the certificate in the resource file.
The private key portion of the key pair should never be hardcoded in any application. The private key should be non exportable and be managed by the operating system only. Windows now has keyguard that uses VSM technology that makes it impossible for even the local administrator to know the private key. The admin can only use it for signing and verifying (and exporting the key, if exporting is enabled) but never be able to look at the private key and misuse it.
Regarding step by step process.

Create a self-signed certificate. This will generate a certificate with both public and private key in the pfx file.
Import the self-signed certificate in the certificate store. This can be achived by simply double-clicking on the file and following the directions.
Export the public portion of newly imported certificate from by opening the certificate manager.
You can embed this public exported certificate in your application as a resource.
The application can then load the certificate from the resource and use it to sign the hash.
On the server side, if the certificate with private key is not already imported, follow the step 2 to import it.
Server can then use the Apis to verify the signed data using private key.

Sample public key generated by server: 9995362445e0a98f4da3019f6f3eb960f938056972408675c0b3f642ad5943709f8e8031f00bba6ed24bad1e8e2b099cd154b5eb5b64b310d179b39abb4392442cdb8ad3fe8bc6e3088bd63089d405fb134c633de62b741e4c5bd615b90e096ec3bb16f71ef54825febc5662a96c093db986225825a1cc63d4dc19e2abbbfb1cb9d3a5e41f757ce3f82481a5caf92207ffe4c37e8acc43835dce49cf61a6b113384d333050b6ac59ef78a182bae114b08729e84cbad659eb8bace0481aa51a370daac09f97d779be245ce95af85a285d0ea170da732f9eef2e43a21f5586014ea00259ef09498356eaf2d4e492f0f8978ca167c3f690b35045a8dd1c7ccf4347

","Well, not an algorithm per se -- once you have the key, the data is decrypted. But there are techniques to do that, and they typically pivot on one of the following:

software obfuscation (you can Google keywords such as ""software protection""), or
hardware attack countermeasures (look up ""Trusted Execution Environment"" for example), or
both at the same time.

This is for example pretty much what happens when you watch a Netflix movie on your PC which is connected to an HDMI TV: at a very simplified level, what happens is the movie is encrypted with a certain DRM key K1, it gets decrypted with K1 on the PC, and then immediately re-encrypted with a new HDCP key K2 on the way out to the TV (then the TV will decrypt it with the same HDCP key K2). Same story with Miracast and other similar protocols.

"17373098","Password as private key for IM","due to all this surveillance on the internet I was planning on writing a complete opensource, cross-platform and fully encrypted chat client including video functionality.
Similar to Skype, but messages and video stream should be fully encrypted and all communication must only occurs between the clients itself and never need to go through any server.
The registration, authentication and online checking, however needs to be done server-side to keep it simple and usable also for beginners.
So to keep it as simple as possible I was gonna go for public/private key encryption.
In order not to store the private key anywhere on the server and also not to carry it to each computer you want to log on, I thought about making password as the private key.
This way you could log on where ever you want and do not have to worry about the key.
If you add a person, you will then automatically send him/her your public key. If he/she accepts, he/she will respond with her/his public key and then you can both chat/video-call.
The problem I am seeing here is:

How can I remain the public key when changing my password (the private key)?
Can I use existing SSL Infrastructure to achieve this, without having to re-implement any encryption standard?

I have already a couple of people willing to help programming (C/C++), but unfortunately none of us is pretty keen on the encryption technology, so I will need to sort those things first. Once I know how to implement the encryption I will publish a diagram and ask for feedback about that.
Thanks in advance.
","First, I think Jitsi roughly is the app your thinking of building. It does encrypted text chat via OTR , and encrypted voice and video chat via ZRTP for key negotiation and SRTP.  In general, cryptographic protocol design is very hard and so if your going to write your own app, you should use these protocols and the libraries that do them. 
To answer your question, you cannot directly derive the key from the password if you want it not to change between passwords. Instead, you store the key on a server encrypted(symmetrically) with a key derived from the password( using say PKBDF2 or scrypt). If the user changes the password, they decrypt the key with their  old password derived key and reencrypt it with their new one.
In general, though, there isn't much of a point in doing this unless your using some webapp type solution where users might log on anywhere. That is actually a very bad idea. See some the the criticism of cryptocat's javascript bassed implementation  e.g. here.

A generates digest H of F with its private Key
A attaches A_pub, H to its request Parameters, sends F and declares origin/sender as A 
B verifies the digest H with the A_pub provided against F
apparently it looks Okay But if some other component V does the same with V_pub and claims itself as A, B still thinks the request came from A as this H is made with V_prv openssl verifies Okay.

A, B and V are application components identified by unique URI. Its currently intended to constraint secure page flow. e.g. you can assume A, B, V be urls What I want is Only A can procced to B and only B can proceed to C .... and I don't want to maintain a global/application wide session for that. so If B can just verify the origin of this link based on the special parameters A have passed to it in a state/session-less manner. and the more generic it can be the more reusable it will be to implement in other scenarios too.
Once I thought to maintain a checksums of A_pub in a trusted global storage. however I am afraid wouldn't that be an over engineering ?
another way comes in my mind is to query back the origin url regarding the public key. However I want to avoid that.
","This technique cannot verify the identity of the sender, only that the keys are a matching pair.  
Typically, B would already possess some piece of trusted information that it can use to validate A's identity.  The information is generally a copy of A_pub that it had previously validated, or that has been signed by a trusted third party, in which case B must have access to that third party's public key.
Without this additional information, B cannot verify the identity of A.

Pretty much anyone who's worked with crypto will tell you that you write crypto at your own risk.  Use the standard libraries, they're made with all the things that (if you are not aware of these techniques) leave your traffic unsecured.  
That said, here's some Python libraries (but you can get this in most languages from PHP to Java or whatever floats your boat):
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycrypto
https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/
Crypto RSA in Python
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyECC
You'll see pycrypto because it's popular if you're looking to use RSA.  Another package is PyECC which includes functionality for elliptic curve crypto.  This is important if you're looking to reduce your key size or have less resources to devote to crypto, usually in mobile systems or something small.  The difference in key sizes (link) can get ridiculous as the keys grow (for increased security)

"53868043","What is CKA_VALUE used in AES secret key generation template?","I am trying to integrate safenet HSM with our application. I am writing the program in C. I am referring to the PKCS11 v2.20 cryptoki standard document from RSA labs. I need to generate an AES 256 bit key. While defining the template for key generation I am not sure what value needs to be passed for CKA_VALUE. While generating a DES3 key, I didn't provide this attribute and I was able to generate a key.
I searched for sample programs for CKA_LABEL but failed to find any solid examples in C. I found a couple of Java programs where they have used CKA_VALUE_LEN instead of CKA_VALUE. I am not sure if that will work.
This is the snippet given in the document. Most websites give only this snippet as an example. Nothing is specified for the array value. 
CK_OBJECT_CLASS class = CKO_SECRET_KEY;
CK_KEY_TYPE keyType = CKK_AES;
CK_UTF8CHAR label[] = “An AES secret key object”;
CK_BYTE value[] = {...};
CK_BBOOL true = CK_TRUE;
CK_ATTRIBUTE template[] = {
{CKA_CLASS, &class, sizeof(class)},
{CKA_KEY_TYPE, &keyType, sizeof(keyType)},
{CKA_TOKEN, &true, sizeof(true)},
{CKA_LABEL, label, sizeof(label)-1},
{CKA_ENCRYPT, &true, sizeof(true)},
{CKA_VALUE, value, sizeof(value)}
};

","The CKA_VALUE is the actual value of the key. When you tell the HSM to generate a secret key, it will generate a key for you on the hardware based on the attributes you pass in secret key template, and set the value generated in the CKA_VALUE. This attribute however cannot be read/extracted nor it can be set when generating the key, because the HSM won't allow you to inject a key (directly) from the software nor allow you to extract it from the HSM (directly).
The CKA_VALUE_LEN is the length of the key you can tell the HSM to generate. The AES key can be of length 128, 192 or 256 bits. Depending on the key size you want you would set the CKA_VALUE_LEN as 16, 24 or 32 (key size as bytes).

As per my research I would need a SSL certificate (pair of keys private and public). I have got to know how to generate a certificate using Bouncy Castle library. 
My questions are:

What I assume is that, in the server side the certificate must contain both private and, public key and in the client side the certificate must contain only the public key of the server. Is this correct?
If the above understanding is correct, how should I generate two certificates, one for server using both public and private key 
and the other one for client by only public key. 

can some one give me some directions on this?
","There are several resources online explaining very well how public-key crypto works.  Generally, your server has two resources: a private key and a certificate.  The public key is contained in the certificate. Usually the private key is protected with a password, so your server will also need that.
The certificate is sent to the client upon connection; but the client needs to trust it.  For that to happen, either the certificate needs to be signed by a trusted authority, or you need to explicitly trust that certificate in the client (the latter case is referred to as a self-signed certificate).
Bouncy castle is a library for these kind of things, but you can use anything for creating your keypair.  The most obvious one is keytool, which comes which java. read up on generating your keypair here.

","If you are the client, ECDHE_{RSA,ECDSA} key exchange must use the 'curve' chosen by the server, and OpenSSL does so; DHE similarly uses server parameters. (Modified somewhat in draft1.3 protocol expected/planned in version 1.1.1.) If you are the server, OpenSSL has several different ways of choosing the 'curve' depending on code you didn't show us: 

1.0.x supports SSL_{CTX_,}set_tmp_ecdh and SSL_{CTX_,}set_tmp_ecdh_callback which don't have man pages but work equivalently to the _dh versions which do.
1.0.2 adds SSL_{CTX_,}set_ecdh_auto which sets a mode that automatically chooses the 'first' (according to client or server list, using the same option as for ciphersuite preference) curve acceptable to both client and server
1.1.0 makes ecdh_auto the default and no longer supports the tmp_ecdh_callback options, but allows tmp_ecdh to be set with the new text-based and file-based config options as well as direct code.

In SUITEB mode, which is (IIUC) not the same thing as 'FIPS' mode (meaning FIPS-140), but is often required for the same users who are subject to the whole range of FIPS and other NIST 'guidance', the only supported curves are P-256 and/or P-384 depending on the option set.
(Technically what we loosely call a 'curve' for EC cryptography is actually a curve with suitable characteristics, defined by coefficients of an equation over an underlying field, plus a base point aka generator, plus the point order and cofactor. Careful or accurate people, like cryptographers, call this a parameter set or an EC group rather than a curve. OpenSSL implements it as typedef EC_GROUP.) 
TLS represents the public key as a point in X9.62 (and SEC1) uncompressed (usually) or optionally compressed (rare) format, both of which have fixed sizes depending on the size of the underlying field.

My question is, When people say that the keys not generated properly
  from random functions are susceptible to break, what they actually
  mean?

Bad randomness is attacked in cryptography in two ways:

By exhaustive search of the seed that was used to generate the stream of bits.  A prominent example is the Debian OpenSSH vulnerability.  
By attacking the predictability of random number generators that were not designed to meet cryptographic requirements.  In statistical random number generators, the main requirement is that the data looks random.  In cryptographic random number generators, we require more: given the stream of bits, a very smart person who knows the algorithm cannot figure out what future or previous bits for the random number generator are.  As an example, although the Mersenne Twister has a large internal state, it does not meet the cryptographic requirement.

Your question about measuring entropy is the wrong question.  Measuring entropy is treating it like it is a statistical random number generator, not like a cryptographic random number generator.  You say:

GenerateRandomString and GenerateRandomSalt just generates random string and bytes based on crypto/rand packages.

That's all you need to know -- you should not need to worry about anything else.  As mentioned above, no amount of measuring entropy is going to tell you that your keys are secure.  Instead, you need to be a cryptographic expert to analyse such algorithms.  For a consumer of the randomness, all you can do (short of using another source such as /dev/urandom) is trust that this has been designed well and analysed by cryptographic experts.

perform some encryption method using a public key, and if the answer they guessed when encrypted is the same as the encrypted answer then they got it right.

When you crypt something with a key (RSA) there are a part that is random so each time that you crypt a message can get a different value, so you have to check if there are in the library that you are going to use (openSSL?) to force this random part. 
You can use a hashing algorithm (MD5, SHA1) that is a common way to achieve your goal

when the user gets the right answer, they must also get the private key to decrypt the next question

I guess that you try that question are not accessible unless you answer the prior question right. So you need to keep a key as secret, so it must be crypted maybe you can use the answer as a key (depending of algorithm that you use to crypt)

","Your question is answered in the introduction page of the tutorial. You would indeed use an API rather than the JDK tools (which are designed to sign jar files) to do such a thing in an application, at runtime:

  or tool features to securely exchange documents with others. To use
  the tools for document exchange, the document(s) must be placed in a

The thing is, now it is time to move from alpha to beta, and we need some sort of safety for the incoming data. And this is where I am lost. How do I implement some resemblance of security in this kind of system?
What I have come up with is a simple asymetric key/value pair, that is unique for each POS system, where the server has all of the private keys, and each pos has the public part of this exchange. In addition to this, all of the data exchange is sent via HTTPS.
Does this kind of thing make sense? Or is there a better way to keep the data safe?
P.S. Since there is a need to reconfigure each POS seperately, that is in no way connected to this system, having to do manual work at each POS is not a problem.
","You'd like to accomplish 2 things:
1) Encrypt the traffic so that it is hidden from outsiders (confidentiality).  You can accomplish this quite easily simply by enforcing that SSL is used for traffic between the client(s) and the server.  The server will require an x509 certificate to accomplish this.
2) Ensure that all traffic coming to the server originates from a trusted client/POS (integrity).  You can accomplish this using a couple of different techniques, both of which require an x509 certificate installed on each client (POS) system:
a) Require that all requests to the server be accompanied by client certificates.  In this scenario, the client (POS) has a x509 certificate installed, for which it is able to access its own private key (the server does not, and should not have this private key, it belongs to the client).  The server is configured to require client certificates with each request, it also is configured to validate that the client certificate presented does indeed match one of the POS systems.  So if you add a new POS later, you need to make a change to the server ensuring that it will consider the new POS cert valid.  Here is a description of the protocol for your own enrichment, you shouldn't need to know exactly how it works (because most tools IIS, Apache, etc. will abstract much of this for you) but it does demystify things a bit.  http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v5r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itim.infocenter.doc%2Fcpt%2Fcpt_ic_security_ssl_authent2way.html
OR
b) Require that all requests to the server are digitally signed by trusted clients.  Public key (asymmetric) encryption allows you to sign a message.  Basically it is signed with the client's (POS) private key, and then anyone (including the server) can verify its integrity by validating the signature using the client's public key.  Many tools will actually encrypt and sign the message, which is OK, but if you're already using SSL and performance is a concern, you don't need to encrypt twice.  If security is more important than performance, encrypting twice can't hurt.  Here is some more info on digital signatures:  http://www.cgi.com/files/white-papers/cgi_whpr_35_pki_e.pdf
So you should have a pretty good plan of how to proceed.  Feel free to ask around here when you set out to implement these solutions, as there are a lot of things that usually don't work the first time around and debugging it is often difficult.  I do recommend a tool called Fiddler or WireShark, which can help debug web services to some extent.  Be sure that your client(s) can access their own private keys, and that the certificates of the clients are trusted by the server.  Good luck.

","If you generate a key for encryption, ""bits"" means the size of the key that should be generated. In a very simplified form, you can think of a key as a secret number. If you use 16 bits to store the key, there are 2^16 = 65536 possible numbers for the key. If you use more bits the range is larger and thus the key is better secured. Using a key that is too small allows to just try out every possible number via a brute-force attack. If you use more bits, the range the secret number is chose from can be large enough that a brute-force attack is not possible any more because it would took years (or even longer) to test all possible numbers. For email encryption via PGP for example, a key size of 2048 bits is recommended nowadays (may people use even 4096 bit keys).

Have also tried removing BEGIN and END certificate.
What I have tried (there are a lot of examples like the one below)
byte[] publicBytes = Base64.decodeBase64(azurePubKey);
X509EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(publicBytes);
KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");

But I am getting the following error:

","You have multiple (many) issues in your code with the encryption
First - encode properly your data, String in Java is to represent printable characters. As soon as you work with encryption (working on byte[] level), you need to encode or decode the values.
Example - your code will print the ""keyHandle"", it's a byte array object hash, not really the encrypted data itself
byte[] keyHandle = cipher.doFinal(or.getBytes());
System.out.println(""Key Handle: ""+keyHandle);
...
String rm = publicKey.toString() + pub + sc + keyHandle;

Use at hex or base64 encoding to print out the output. The same applies to the signature.

I am unable to solve the decryption error. 

String kh = s.substring(64);
byte[] kh1 = kh.getBytes();
..  
byte[] keyHandle = cipher.doFinal(kh1);

And you simply assume you can decrypt some random substring? Encrypting using RSA will produce output of size of the key (e.g. 2048 bits) and you have to store and decrypt as whole, not any substring.
As a learning exercise - try to simply encrypt and decrypt, encode, decode to learn the primitives you can (re)use.

Now I want to decrypt in in JAVA source code. IS there any way to do it?
","Yes, our code does exactly this.  We encrypt database encryption keys using the openssl tool and then decrypt them in Java using Java's built in Crypto package:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/crypto/package-summary.html
I think this S.O. post might give you the information you need:
Java equivalent of an OpenSSL AES CBC encryption
Seems like good stuff here too:
Java decryption of an encrypted file with openssl aes 256 cbc
There should be multiple answers to this question to be had via Google or previous S.O. questions in addition to these.  I think the basic idea is here in these posts.  The trick will be getting everything right for whatever encryption parameters your using to encrypt.  You seem to be using all of the defaults.  We use the -aes-256-cbc option.  If you can control what encryption parameters you can use, finding an answer might be eaiser.

We also have one more condition that (p -1)/2 and (q -1)/2 are both primes.

What is the quickest way to find p and q? i.e. factor N. 

So I'm completely lost on how to approach the solution to this problem. If somebody can provide me with hints/solution to solve this problem I would be really grateful. Thanks. 
","In g^x = 1, the solution x will always be a divider of (p-1)*(q-1). Choose some different g values, and you will likely find most factors of (p-1)*(q-1). And as (p-1)(q-1) = N - p - q + 1, knowing (p-1)(q-1) and N results in knowing p + q. Knowing N = p*q and p+q is like knowing circumference and area of a rectangle, and can be quickly solved for p and q.

public ECPublicKey toECPublicKey() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException {

    KeyFactory keyFactory = getECKeyFactory();
    return (ECPublicKey)keyFactory.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);

I cannot find how to accomplish this in Objective C as CommonCrypto seems to lack JWK support. Does anyone have an idea on how I can get the other party's JWK key into a readable format (.pem, SecKeyRef, or NSData) from the x and y values of the curve?

"27493406","SSL Certificate Validation for cross server communications","I am writing a python based monitoring agent and a php based service that aggregates all of the agent's data.. I want to be able to securely validate that the server is authorized to talk to the agent.
My thoughts were to exchange SSL certificates between the agent and the server and do some sort of validation with the public/private keys. Much like puppet does/did with agents and puppetmaster.
The agent runs a small python web service on port 8089, and accepts connections from a whitelisted hostname (srv01). This web service receives commands and does various stuff on the ""client"" system in which the agent runs on.
What would be the best way to authenticate and authorize this cross communication from server->agent:8089. Initially I was going to generate a unique sha256 hash and store it both on the agent and server and just do a comparison of this. Is this acceptable, or is there something else I should be looking into?
I would assume a basic flow of getting this process to work would be..

generate a keypair on the server
copy the private key to the agent via ssh or scp
server communicates to the agent via http port 8089, passing along its public key
agent validates the public key against the private key
if the validation is successful, the agent goes and does stuff.

as an FYI, These servers are firewalled off from the rest of the world in an enterprise environment.

I have fields in a database in my application which I want to ensure that only authorized users can decrypt (and developers/administrators of the system are NOT implicitly authorized).  For users logging in with a password this is easy - make an RSA keypair where the private key is encrypted with their login password, and update a keychain if the password ever changes.  But how can this be done when there is no login password, because the user has been authenticated with SAML?
","I hate to tell you this, but I don't consider your secure option (derived key) all that secure either.
The reality is that an admin can do very bad things here...including:

Inject code on the f/e and steal passwords in flight
Steal the data and do a dictionary attack against the db directly, guessing many possible keys to unlock the data (knowing that the password set is relatively small)

IMO just deriving a key from the password isn't enough. You need to raise the bar materially higher if you want to consider it ""best practice."" Ideally you could solve both problems with one solution but if you use password as a source (or derived password hashes) then it might not be possible.

","You must either use a video player that natively knows how to decrypt that format (contact the vendor of the back end), or put a piece of middleware in to decrypt the format (contact the vendor of the back end).  In both cases, you'll need the key as well.

"39411808","SecKeyRawSign returning error -1, ""generic error""?","I am working on an iOS application that needs to generate a key pair on the device, store the private key in the Secure Enclave, and then access it later to use for signing (does not need to be exported, ever). When I sign, I always hash the data using SHA256, following a couple of stack Overflow answers, and it seems to be working when I print the results. However, after obtaining a valid private key reference from the KeyChain, hashing the data to be signed, and specifying that it is a SHA256 hash, SecKeyRawSign still returns -1.

We use PGP public/private key pair for file encryption and decryption . for a time being we keep our public/private key in local system. but as per requirement we want to keep these keys on Azure's keyVault . But i didn't found any document related to import my existing PGP public/private key in Azure's keyVault. 
I am confused after reading MS Azure's documentation and related blog posts, where some sources claim Asymmetric key encryption is supported, but there is no official documentation on this.
","When you use Azure Key Vault, you can import or generate keys in hardware security modules (HSMs) that never leave the HSM boundary. This scenario is often referred to as bring your own key, or BYOK. The HSMs are FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated. Azure Key Vault uses nCipher nShield family of HSMs to protect your keys.
Use the information in this topic to help you plan for, generate, and then transfer your own HSM-protected keys to use with Azure Key Vault.
This functionality is not available for Azure China.

Similar to how regular public key transactions work, but server agnostic.
A use case:
Everything on my Facebook profile is encrypted, and no body would be able to view that information (not even facebook). The users that I give the key would be able to decrypt that information.
This would allow complete control of data stored online.
The same idea can be applied for pictures uploaded to the internet.
One issue that I see is to have a practical mechanism to manage keys and a secure way to distribute keys to other users.
Has anyone done something like this before?
","In case of Facebook I can imagine encrypting the data with OpenPGP keys into armored (text) format. Then you can place encrypted block to facebook or anywhere else. Other users would take the block, decrypt it on the client side and see it.
The same applies with other social networks and places where you can store some text block. 
You can easily do encryption in some client application and even in Javascript (if you manage to make JavaScript load local user's keys somehow).

I am therefore having trouble determining which are the public and private keys in the byte slice itself.
","The private key is a superset of the public key.  It always contains the public key.  Usually a public key is stored as part of a certificate.
If you really want to get the public key by itself, you can grab the X and Y big integers from the ecdsa public key struct and store the binary representation of them.
You might benefit from a bit of retrospect on your design here.  There aren't too many situations where you need to communicate a public key alone.

I am trying to use this method to encrypt my data that is going to be sent to the server and it should do it under a second
How can I do it?
","I think in general your questions on performance are answered here. wikipedia : modular exponentiation
The article describes

Direct exponentiation
Memory efficient exponentiation
Binary exponentiation

Direct Exponentiation
raise to the power e and take the modulo.
This is straight forward, but the size of the number pre modulo is extermely large.
Memory efficient exponentiation
Replacing the power operation with a multiply e times, allows the accumulated result to always be within the modulo range.  This limits the size of the bignum and speeds up the operation.
Binary exponentiation
If you convert the power to a binary number 
if e = 13  => 1101
pow(n, 13) = pow( n, 8) * pow(n,4) * pow(n, 1)
So for an m bit exponent, then only about m operations need to be done.
Combining the memory efficient and binary exponentiation solves most of the performance.
Python offers an implementation of these improvements using the 3 argument power function e.g. 
>>> import timeit
>>> t = timeit.Timer( 'print(pow( 10,14918179, 15372757))' )
>>> t.timeit(1)
10140931
0.06365180000000237

>>> u = timeit.Timer( 'print(pow( 10,14918179) % 15372757)' )
>>> u.timeit(1)
10140931
15.021656000000007

The 3 parameter of pow takes .06s whilst the 2 parameter version of pow takes 15 seconds.

","Java stores the public keys in SubjectPublicKeyInfo structures. These structures are also present in the certificate. They are ASN.1 DER encoded.
RSA public keys consist of multiple (2) components anyway: the modulus and the public exponent. The modulus is already 2048 bits; it determines the key length. The public exponent is often set to the value ""F4"", the fourth number of Fermat, 0x010001. These need to be separated for a generic implementation to distinguish them.

However what you can do however is limit the number of variations in your implementation. This means support only one TLS version (e.g. TLS 1.2) and support only one dedicated cipher suite.
Anyway the pitfalls when implementing TLS are so numerous that I recommend you to use an existing implementation (e.g. implementing in a way that does not allow side channel attacks is not that simple and requires knowledge on that topic). There are other implementations beside OpenSSL with a much smaller footprint.
BTW: If you can presume the connection is trusted you don't need TLS. If you need TLS it should be a secure.

The point of verification is less to find out if the server is trusted, but more that you are actually talking to the server you expect to. If you omit this step you are open to man-in-the-middle attacks.
But, TLS is a very flexible protocol and there are actually ways to use anonymous authentication or a shared secret with TLS and thus skip usage of certificates. Of course in this case you would need to have some other way to validate the server, because otherwise you would be still open to man-in-the-middle-attacks. And because this use case is mostly not relevant for the common usage on the internet it is usually not implemented inside the browsers.

"45587384","ssh (and git) authentication issues on external port/ip (local ip works fine)","I am trying to set up a git repository on a server machine that is remote-accessible over the internet.
I have succeeded in getting git working over local/internal IP addresses.  Within local LAN, I have private-key-based authentication working for SSH (password logins disabled), and I can clone, push, and pull successfully using Git and SSH, e.g.;
ssh USER@192.168.1.xxx
[-> accepts public key, gives me a remote console prompt as ""USER"", etc]

git clone git+ssh://USER@192.168.1.xxx//gitdir/project.git
[-> creates a local clone as desired, commits and push work, no problems seemingly]

However, I am now trying to access this machine via an external/internet IP in the same way, and I don't understand the behavior it's giving me.  

I have enabled port forwarding on my router for port 22 to the server machine.  
I have opened port 22 in software on ""UFW"" on the server machine.
As far as I can tell, I have no settings on my router, SSH configs, or UFW that would block any specific web address or otherwise cause problems on either my local machine or the server.  The server should accept a connection from any external address accessing via port 22, and both my local machine and the server allow outgoing connections in general.
I am using Ubuntu 17.04 on the local machine, if that matters. 
Both the server and the local machine are currently on the same LAN/connected to the same router.
I have DISABLED ""ChallengeResponseAuthentication"" and ""PasswordAuthentication"", and have ENABLED ""PubkeyAuthentication"" in my ""sshd_config"".  
I have quadruple-checked that I was using the correct IP, and used copy-paste rather than manual typing.  Unless I am truly missing something, I am attempting to connect to the correct machine.

For a direct SSH login, I get this (using the -v flag):

Git similarly asks for my remote user's password when I try to clone from the server via the external IP (because it's working through SSH of course), if I do the following to set it  to use an external IP, instead of the original local IP:

Any help understanding what I'm missing here would be much appreciated; thanks.
","Figured it out:
I am unclear as to why, but my system does not like it when I try to access my server via an external public ip, from inside my own LAN.  I assume this is because of some kind of packet confusion as the local machine and the server machine share the same public ip via the router (confirmation on this would be appreciated).
When I tried to connect from another network, things worked correctly and as expected.  I am asked for my public key and immediately rejected with no password prompt if I don't supply the right one, and both SSH and git via SSH seem to work as desired over the internet after I change my repo source to use the public ip.  Any further details were covered by editing ~/.ssh/config to set key identities and hosts.
Marking as solved.  Thank you.

now if one of the client users is malicious he can steal the private key from his machine.
the question is : provided that the public key is secret and this is the only use of that key pair and i absolutely don't need any encryption on the data file. does stealing the private key from a client compromise my public key? i.e can the malicious user craft a file signature so that the data file appear to be coming from me?
","I belive you've designed this backwards.You want to send the public key to the clients and keep the private to yourself. The public key is public; anyone should be able to know it. The private key is private; only the owner should know it.
Rather than hashing the file and encrypting the hash with the public key, you want to sign the file with your private key and let the clients use the public key to verify the signature. The signing operation performs the same idea as your ""encrypt the hash"" but is the standard construction, and your RSA tools likely include a signing function.

I mean, there is no point in encrypting every each symbol in a string separately. Because same symbols will give us same ciphers (like Caesar cipher). So I think I should divide the whole message into blocks of same length.
But it makes it difficult to decrypt the message. Because after you encrypt the blocks, the length of each block could change. So when decrypting, you don't know where a certaing blocks starts and where it ends.
For example, when I encrypt ""stronger"" with RSA I get:
5716225862
I divided the original message into 4 blocks of 4 symbols. But after encrypting I get a message of 10 symbols. And that's the problem.
Hope, you understand what I mean. Sorry for my bad English.
","Simply said, RSA is not for directly encrypting plain text, it is used for encrypting a symmetric key (AES, for instance), and this is with this symmetric key that you will encrypt (and further decrypt) your plain text.
Since the plain text may have any size, it is encrypted using AES with a stream cipher (for instance AES-256-GCM) or a block cipher (for instance AES-256-CBC).
With AES, same symbols will not give same ciphers, since you have to choose a new random IV (initialization vector) each time you encrypt your plain text.
So, you need to use a 2-steps encryption scheme: use RSA to encrypt a symmetric key, and use this symmetric key to encrypt your plain text.

","That tutorial says:

The default HTTPS configuration will use a certificate and key generated by the ssl-cert package. They are good for testing, but the auto-generated certificate and key should be replaced by a certificate specific to the site or server. 

This means, that's there's a default certificate involved. You should generate your own certificate for personal use and look for nasty things when it changes during your connections. You can do that with tools like OpenSSL. If you want to secure a public site, you would need to buy a certificate from a respected authority, so plain users wouldn't be bothered to add the certificate to their browsers and they would also not track if that thing changes.

Extract the public key as base64
val keystoreEntry = keyStore.getEntry(KEY_ALIAS, null) as KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry
val publicKey = Base64.encodeToString(keystoreEntry.certificate.publicKey.encoded, 0)

Send the message, signature (base64) and public key (base64) to server
Try to verify the signature

I've surrounded the public key with ""-----BEGIN RSA KEY-----"" and ""-----END RSA KEY-----"" - is that right? Without doing that I got an error about the RSA key format being invalid
My private key and signed message both have line breaks in them - should I remove these? I've tried with and without them, it doesn't seem to make a difference but would appreciate any advice
PyCharm complains about signature.verify(digest, signature.encode()):

Expected type ModuleType, got SHA256Hash instead.


The docs say digest should be a type from Crypto.Hash, and I'm using Crypto.Hash.SHA256Hash, so why is PyCharm complaining? Can I ignore?

I'm using pycryptodome's PKCS1_v1_5 class to create a signature verifier. I have no idea what that is, I'm just following code I've seen on SO. Is it the right thing to use?
I'm using the algorithm ""SHA256withRSA"" to sign on android, and on the server using PKCS1_v1_5 with an RSA key and passing in a SHA256 hash of the message. I have very little understanding of all these standards. Does this sound right?

I have no idea where to go form here, any suggestions appreciated!
","I figured it out - I had forgotten that the signature had been encoded to base64 on the Android side, so needs to be decoded on the server side. So changing this:
signature.verify(digest, signed_message.encode())

to:
signature.verify(digest, base64.b64decode(signed_message))

Resolves the problem :)

","public key / private key encryption was designed to deal with just this problem.
both parties can freely exchange only their public keys for the other to encrypt outgoing messages with.
Man in the middle attacks can only occur in the sense that a 3rd party can generate messages as either party but can decrypt neither (as they would need the private keys).
A complete secure exchange to eliminate man in the middle might go like this:

both parties exchange public keys
party A sends a message with a random number contained within it
party B decrypts the random number and replies with the same number encrypted for party A.
when party A gets the same number back, they can be sure that no man in the middle attack has occurred.
all messages will continue to use the number as proof of who the message came from.

This is being done in python. The system can be configured to encrypt the files before storage.
The question is whether it is still safe to store the digest for the unencrypted file.
This digest is used as an identifier for the stored files and is also used to detect if the file being added to the system already exists. I am okay with the chance of collision of sha256 algorithm for this purpose. I have also read that the digest produced by sha256 cannot be used to recreate the original data.
Assuming the file cannot be reconstructed from the hash and the fact that the file is stored in encrypted form, it should be safe to keep the original hash for comparisons/searching right... or should I rethink my strategy? these comparisons are going to be internal to the application and will not be exposed to the user in anyway.
","Preimage resistence of SHA-256 is 2^256, and collision resistance is 2^128 (brief summary). On the other hand, you can simply check the number of combinations needed to guess the key to decrypt the file. SHA-256 preimage attack complexity is comparable to cracking 256-bit key for symmetric encryption. So, in general, I'd say, this approach is secure enough, because it's easier to restore the original file by guessing the key rather than finding preimage from SHA-256. 
Would be good to know which algorithm and parameters you're going to use for file encryption, maybe in your case the answer would be different.

Alice wants to get messages securely. She uses a key generation algorithm KG1 to create private key ""C2A836B33FF1E"" and public key ""35B1AC692"" and publishes the public key to the world.
Bob puts the input of his message ""HELLO FROM BOB"" and the public key  ""35B1AC692"" into encryption algorithm EA1 which yields the string ""DF1537532CB23B"" and sends this string to Alice. Chuck intercepts a copy too.
Alice has a decryption algorithm DA1 that can take as input the string ""DF1537532CB23B"" and her private key ""C2A836B33FF1E"" and yield output ""HELLO FROM BOB"", but since Chuck doesn't have the private key ""C2A836B33FF1E"", he can't convert ""DF1537532CB23B"" into ""HELLO FROM BOB"". Also, though Chuck knows the KG1 algorithm and the public key ""35B1AC692"", he can't use this information to work back to the private key.
","Yep that's pretty much it. Note that it is not completely correct to say that Chuck can't decrypt the message, but rather he can't do it easily with known mathematical methods. The reason for this is that the key generation algorithms rely on what are known as one-way functions. These are functions that are relatively easy to compute for a given input, but very difficult to work back from the output. 
An example of a one way function is multiplying two large prime numbers together; the multiplication is easy, but finding the prime factors again is very difficult, barring some new mathematical breakthrough.
As to the implementations of the methods, they vary depending on the exact encryption scheme being used. One of the earlier and better known public key encryption schemes is RSA. There are detailed steps on all three of key generation, encryption, and decryption here.

","You got things right. The main problem caused by this scheme is ""How can Bob be sure that the public key he got from ""the world"" is Alice's public key, and not Chuck's public key? Indeed, if it were Chuck's public key, Chuck would be able to decrypt the message Bob sends to Alice. 
This is resolved by certificates. Every participant has a copy of the public key of well-known and trusted certificate authorities. When Alice want to publish it public key to the world, she pays one of these authorities to get a certificate, containing her public key. When getting a certificate, everyone can verify, with the authority's public key, that the certificate hasn't been corrupted, and so be sure that the public key is Alice's public key, and not Chuck's. 
The basic process of certification is a cryptographic signature : the certificate authority encrypts some data with its private key. When you have the data, its signature, and the authority's public key, you may verify that decrypting the signature with the authority's public key leads to the original data.
RSA is a de facto standard, and is available in many languages and platforms. You shouldn't reimplement it yourself.

Accessing the certificate, public and private keys using pkcs11 Objects work fine as is signing and signature verification. Howerver, for the life of me, I cannot figure out why encrypting with the public key does not work. Here is my code:
import pkcs11
from pkcs11 import Attribute, ObjectClass, KeyType, util
lib = pkcs11.lib('/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11/onepin-opensc-pkcs11.so')
token = lib.get_token(token_label='PIV Card Holder pin (PIV_II)'
session = token.open(user_pin=pin)
# Getting a private and a public key as pkcs11 Object
private = next(session.get_objects({
    Attribute.CLASS: ObjectClass.PRIVATE_KEY, 
}))
public = next(session.get_objects({
    Attribute.CLASS: ObjectClass.PUBLIC_KEY, 
}))
data = 'Hello, world!'
sig = private.sign(data) # Works!
sig_verif = public.verify(data, sig) # Works!
print(""Signature is valid? ""+str(sig_verif)) # True
# So far, everything above worked fine.
# ----------
# Now, this is the part that does not work
encrypt_data = public.encrypt(data) # Fails!

The last line above fails with pkcs11.exceptions.FunctionNotSupported error. I did some research, and it the explanation I found seems to imply that this function (encrypt) is not supported by the openSC library file (*.so) that I am using. However, I find it hard to believe considering that signature feature works just fine. 
Just to make sure that I can use this particular public key outside of session context, I tried the following code using Crypto package:
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP
public_key = RSA.importKey(public[Attribute.VALUE]) # The content of pkcs11 public key as DER
cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(public_key)
encr_data = cipher.encrypt(data) # This works!

So, it seems that using my stand-alone public key allows me to encrypt data. But why can't I do it in the context of a pkcs11 token session?

","I'm sorry, but I think this is just a shortcoming of the API. As encryption with the public key doesn't require any security, it doesn't make sense to implement it on the Yubikey. It is much faster to export the public key values and perform the encryption on the host.
To be fair, Yubikey could have been nice and implement the functionality in software within the Ubikey PKCS#11 library. If you really want to then you could create a new PKCS#11 ""wrapper"" library that does contain the missing functionality in software; all other commands that Yubikey does implement can be forwarded to the original Yubikey PKCS#11 library.

"58584152","Encrypting a data with a public key using pkcs11 module fails","I am using Python's pkcs11 package to access an X.509 certificate stored on my Yubikey 5. Accessing the certificate, public and private keys using pkcs11 Objects work fine as is signing and signature verification. Howerver, for the life of me, I cannot figure out why encrypting with the public key does not work. Here is my code:
import pkcs11
from pkcs11 import Attribute, ObjectClass, KeyType, util
lib = pkcs11.lib('/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11/onepin-opensc-pkcs11.so')
token = lib.get_token(token_label='PIV Card Holder pin (PIV_II)'
session = token.open(user_pin=pin)
# Getting a private and a public key as pkcs11 Object
private = next(session.get_objects({
    Attribute.CLASS: ObjectClass.PRIVATE_KEY, 
}))
public = next(session.get_objects({
    Attribute.CLASS: ObjectClass.PUBLIC_KEY, 
}))
data = 'Hello, world!'
sig = private.sign(data) # Works!
sig_verif = public.verify(data, sig) # Works!
print(""Signature is valid? ""+str(sig_verif)) # True
# So far, everything above worked fine.
# ----------
# Now, this is the part that does not work
encrypt_data = public.encrypt(data) # Fails!

The last line above fails with pkcs11.exceptions.FunctionNotSupported error. I did some research, and it the explanation I found seems to imply that this function (encrypt) is not supported by the openSC library file (*.so) that I am using. However, I find it hard to believe considering that signature feature works just fine. 
Just to make sure that I can use this particular public key outside of session context, I tried the following code using Crypto package:
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP
public_key = RSA.importKey(public[Attribute.VALUE]) # The content of pkcs11 public key as DER
cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(public_key)
encr_data = cipher.encrypt(data) # This works!

So, it seems that using my stand-alone public key allows me to encrypt data. But why can't I do it in the context of a pkcs11 token session? 
Then, I tried using the pkcs11 Object decrypt function to try to decrypt the data generated using Crypto module above:
decrypted = private.decrypt(encr_data) # It fails!

The above failed with pkcs11.exceptions.MechanismInvalid error. I tried using different mechanisms, but all of them resulted in the same error. What is interesting -- it seems that pkcs11 object allows me to at least invoke decrypt function without complaining that it is not supported.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! 
","After doing a rather extensive research and taking into consideration this thread's replies, I found that encryption not working in this token session is due to the OpenSC API limitation. As a matter of fact there is a compatibility table on the python-pkcs11 page that shows (in plain text) that OpenSC does not support Encryption, Symmetric keys generation, key wrapping and other functionalities. It does fully support signing/verification and partially supports decryption. Had I done a better search, it would've saved me a lot of time.
As a matter of fact, it is very useful to do a hard token test using 'pkcs11-tool', as it will show the supported functionalities and mechanisms for each PIV slot. In my case, I invoked it as follows: 
pkcs11-tool -p $pin -t

and received the following report:

From there, we can see that decryption is supported for all three occupied slots but only with RSA-X-509 and RSA-PKCS mechanisms (no OAEP). 
Now, I am considering fusing the pkcs11-tool and openssl functionalities to do data encryption. I haven't figured out all the intricacies of this kind of flow, but I am thinking something of this sort:

(pkcs11-tool) Export a certificate from a desired PIV slot
(openssl) Create a symmetric (e.g., AES) secret key
(openssl) Encrypt the data with this secret key
(openssl) Use the certificate from step 1 to encrypt the secret key 
Send the [symmetrically] encrypted data and [asymmetrically] encrypted secret key to the recipient
(pkcs11-tool) Decrypt the secret key on the secure token
(openssl) Use the decrypted secret key to decrypt the actual data

It looks like I should be able to implement such a workaround either in Linux shell using pkcs11-tool and openssl utilities or in Python using pkcs11 and OpenSSL libraries. The latter seems more preferable if I decide to later do it through GUI. This all seems quite low level, so I am wondering if there is a easier way to encrypt/decrypt data. I know that PGP fuses the encrypted data and wrapped secret key together into one single file, so the end-users only have to execute one command on their end.

"39402747","Creating a short-lived ""shared secret"" token between client/server for administrative commands","I have a simple client/server example up and running which uses client code and server code courteously provided by the OpenSSL team. I would like to add a feature to the client so that it attempts to run ""privileged"" commands. Some background:

When the tool is installed, some kind of key/token is installed on the system as well (token 1).
When the remote server wants to ""push"" data to the client, it requests a separate token (token 2), from a trusted authority (ie: separate off-site server), and sends token 2 to the client.
The client performs an operation on the two tokens, and if they ""match"" (ie: the two combined forms a valid key, one decrypts the other, or some similar mechanism), a temporary key is generated. The client needs this key to perform certain operations (ie: enter ""manager mode"" and do operations it wouldn't normally trigger).
The client may be asked by the server to re-create its security token (token #1') and re-submit its public key to the server.

The goal of the system is to give system administrators a narrow window where they can send special commands to the client by using a token which expires. Is there an existing mechanism (ie: within libssl) which could be used to accomplish what I've described above?
I think I could just implement this by doing essentially another key exchange over the already-encrypted TLS connection, but I'm not 100% sure if that's the ideal way to do this. The message I'd be sending would effectively be ""MANAGER MODE AUTHORIZED"" after the challenge completes. The client could be coded to exit manager mode after 5 minutes automatically. Is it really a safe test if the algorithm is effectively: ""decrypt this, and if it says MANAGER MODE AUTHORIZED, proceed""?
Thank you.

I completely control the client (mobile application) and control the server.  I want to develop a system where the client can add or subtract a value stored in the server's database.

Someone could take a packet capture from the client, view the HTTP POST parameters necessary to modify to server's currency value, and just reproduce those packets whenever they want.
My first thought was to have the client encrypt the new currency value with a public key and then have the server decrypt it with a private key.  I would also embed a timestamp and their username along with the new currency value before it gets encrypted so the request would always be different.  The server would then check the timestamp and reject if it's past 10 seconds.  One problem with this approach is if the client or server are out of sync time based.

","A general security tip: You do NOT control the client if it's out in the wild! The server must check everything the client sends.
Simple flow:

Client connects to server with a username/password via SSL, setting up a ""session"".
Client sends a command (increment product X by amount Y)
Server receives this request through the SSL connection
Server checks the request is valid, that the logged-in user is
allowed to do this, executes the command and sends a response to the
client indicating failure or success.
Client disconnects, sending a ""session terminated"" message (the
session should also timeout after a set period as well).

Note:
Everything must be authenticated and checked server-side! Your client application should not be the one in charge of working out what is a ""valid"" request and what is not - that's the job of the server. Each request should go via SSL, and should only be executed once the client has successfully logged on and started a session. Even with a timestamp-based check, someone could reverse engineer your client or use a man-in-the-middle attack, but only if they have a username/password (or are able to intercept a legitimate client's data - hard with SSL/public/private key system). If very strong security is mandatory, every request from the client should be encrypted by RSA.

The tokens are signed by one party's private key (usually the
  server's), so that both parties (the other already being, by some
  suitable and trustworthy means, in possession of the corresponding
  public key) are able to verify that the token is legitimate.1

I'm just wondering what need is there for the client to verify the authenticity of the JWT? I understand the same mechanism is used for SSL, in which case client-side verification makes sense to me as the certificate contains the public key used by the client to encrypt the initial handshake. But I struggle to understand what benefit public verifiability serves in the case of JWTs. If the JWT were illegitimate, it'd fail on the server anyway, and the client isn't doing anything special aside from tacking it onto the request.
Couldn't just hashing with some private salt on the server satisfy the purpose it serves? The server verifies by hashing the payload with the same salt and comparing against the signature. In this case, only the server can verify, but so what?
","
So my understanding is that a JWT is signed by the server with a private key and its legitimacy verified by comparing the public key decrypted signature against the header + payload by both/either the server and client:

Thiis is incomplete. A JWT can be signed with the private key of a key pair(e.g RSA), or using a symmetric key(e.g HMAC). In this case the same secret key is used to sign and to verify the token

I'm just wondering what need is there for the client to verify the authenticity of the JWT?

When the token is signed with an asymmetric key pair is expected that the client verifies the token. Using a symmetric key, it is only known by the issuer party, so the client can not verify it
See my answer here: When to use RS256 for JWT?

I understand the same mechanism is used for SSL, in which case client-side verification makes sense to me as the certificate contains the public key used by the client to encrypt the initial handshake

Some data used in the handshake is digitally signed (not encrypted) by the server with its private key, and verified by the client

If the JWT were illegitimate, it'd fail on the server anyway, and the client isn't doing anything special aside from tacking it onto the request.

No, if the verification server is not the same that the issuing server (see the above link one more time). 
Suppose the token has been issued by a third party ( e.g. goggle or facebook) as a result of an oauth2 authentication process. It can contains the details of the connected user, and it has been provided to your server using a redirect, so you can not trust the calling party. You must verify that the token has been issued by the expected party.

"30789388","Seeking: public-key algorithm where public encryption is more expensive than private decryption","I'm looking for a public-key crypto algorithm where encrypting a digital signature with a public key is more computationally expensive than decrypting it with a private key—ideally, significantly more expensive. (see ★ below for why)
I’ve profiled a few algorithms (sha1, md5…) and have gotten this sort of result:
Public encryption: 330ms
Private decryption: 4474ms

This would be fine if the time values were reversed. Any suggestions?

My profiling approach:
$res = openssl_pkey_new(array('encrypt_key' => false, 'digest_alg' => 'sha1',
                              'private_key_bits' => 1024));
openssl_pkey_export($res, $privatekey);

$publickey = openssl_pkey_get_details($res);
$publickey = $publickey[""key""];

function rutime($ru, $rus, $index) {
 return ($ru[""ru_$index.tv_sec""]*1000 + intval($ru[""ru_$index.tv_usec""]/1000))
     -  ($rus[""ru_$index.tv_sec""]*1000 + intval($rus[""ru_$index.tv_usec""]/1000));
}

$cleartext = ""Hey hello hi"";
$crypted = array();
$reps = 10000;

// test public key encryption time
$rustart = getrusage();
for ($i = 1; $i <= $reps; ++$i) {
 openssl_public_encrypt($cleartext, $crypttext, $publickey);
 $crypted[] = $crypttext;
}
$ru = getrusage();
echo ""Public encryption: "".rutime($ru, $rustart, ""utime"").""ms\n"";

// test private key decryption time
$rustart = getrusage();
for ($i = 1; $i <= $reps; ++$i) {
 $crypttext = &$crypted[$i];
 openssl_private_decrypt($crypttext, $decrypted, $privatekey);
}
$ru = getrusage();
echo ""Private decryption: "".rutime($ru, $rustart, ""utime"").""ms\n"";

★ …because I’m investigating ways to make “talking” more expensive than “listening”. If the client has to do difficult crypto-math before sending a message back to the server, and the server can do easy crypto-math to validate that message, it’d make spamming the server with a script more difficult.

I'm hoping the following will be secure and only requires access to the internet on server/client initialization.
Is this open to attackers? (assuming the local server is secured and private key can not be extracted)

Server initializes, generates Pub/Private key pair. User signs
into account with remote server which issues access token (JWT) for remote server (HTTPS). User creates local server account (Username/Password)
Local server uploads public key to remote server (HTTPS) using remote server access token. 
Client initializes and discovers server  
Server responds with server id  
Client hits remote server with the server id (HTTPS) and gets the public key and stores it. 
Client generates Pub/Private key.  
Signs into local server account sending username/password/public-key envcypted with local server public key
Local Server issues access token (JWT) and stores
client public key with that token. Any response to this access token is encrypted (body/headers) with client public key. 
Client now communicates to local server with accesstoken and encryped headers/body with Local server public key.
Server responds to requests with body/headers encrypted with access token public key

","Of course, you can use only one key for each message and we called this forward security. To achieve this you need to use a key exchange protocol as Diffie-Hellman Key exchange protocol. This will increase communication, but security is not cheap and it is used in TLS 1.3 
With forward secrecy, even successful attacks in of the parties, the attacker can at most access the current key if there is an encryption operation. The previous keys are not stored once the message was sent so there is no key compromise.

","It is well possible, but feasibility may depend on how you use your keys.
As already answered - ephemeral (one-time temporary) keys are used in TLS for achieving forward-secrecy in the key-excange to derive symmetric session encryption keys. So it's not really a new keypair for every message, but rather for establishig a session. Generating a new good key may needs some performance and time.
Even so your app needs to maintain a long-time key to sign the ephemeral public key to ensure integrity so the recceiving party can be sure the ephemeral keys are really from party it claims to be. That is as well part of te TLS key exchange.
If you are not using direct (session) communication, but sending the messages asynchronously, I see no point to generate a new keypair. You can just create a new random encryption key (assuming hybrid encryption). To ensure integrity the message needs to be signed by the sender as well, so a long-lived persistent key is necessary.

","For encryption, the message receiver could generate a new public/private key pair and send the public key to the message sender.  The sender could then encrypt using this public key.  This decreases the risk due to a compromised key pair.  You lose just one message if the ephemeral key is compromised instead of all of them if a long-term key is compromised.
However, encrypting alone does not provide security.  You also need to authenticate the sender and receiver and provide integrity.  
For authentication, you either need a large set of pre-generated keys that are mapped to particular identities in a secure way (e.g., certificate signed by trusted certificate authority, as in PKI), or some other way to prove who generated each key pair.  This is the tremendous syncing effort you mention.  
The PKI method introduces many ways to authenticate as a user due to their many keys, so it actually reduces security by increasing the attack surface.  If you do things right, the bigger attack surface is balanced by the fact that an attack on an ephemeral key limits damage to a single message.  However, to enforce this limit, you have to have a secure, public place where a list of valid/used keys is maintained in real-time.  Otherwise the single-use keys could be re-used.
If you don't pre-generate keys, you need a long-term public/private key pair to establish ownership of the temporary pair through a method such as a signature.  You may reduce the risk of compromise to the long-term key pair by using it just for signing ephemeral key pairs.  However, this just reduces one type of risk associated with the long-term key pair.  You still have risks associated with generation, distribution, storage, and binding the long-term key pair to a particular user, and the ephemeral key pairs are dependent on the long-term key pair for their security.
For integrity, you can use digital signatures.  Many digital signature methods are similar to authentication methods, where a private key operation is the key security operation.
Bottom line: you may be able to increase security by using ephemeral key pairs for each message, but performance will be impacted, you have to be careful about implementation, and the security benefits are minimal.

For example, I'm calling the getUserInfo API in one of the webpages. It will return the user's Id, role, department and other details. I want to hide those details getting displayed to the users.  I don't want to display the user's ID, department and some other details getting displayed to the end user. But I need those details for some of the actions in my application.

"23692496","How to encode/store encrypted messages","I'm doing encryption with AES and RSA.
Once the encryption stage is complete, I have two pieces of data to transmit.

The AES256 encrypted message - AES256(message,Key)
The AES256 symmetric Key Encrypted with the RSA public key - RSA(Key)

As this data is byte arrays, I naturally feel like I should be Base64 encoding it.
This data is only ever encrypted and decrypted from my own code, so Base64(RSA(Key)) + ""\r\n"" + Base64(AES256(message,Key)) ""works"",  but is there a standard I should be using for doing this?
","You can use a standardized container format as Oleg has suggested. Well known ones are CMS (derived from PKCS#7) and PGP. XML encryption is also possible, but I would personally try to avoid it unless you are very sure you understand the security of XML encryption. Both Sun and Apache didn't - to name just a few.
As for Base64, you should only base 64 encode anything if you think that your ciphertext is used as text anywhere within the system. If you don't encode it you are very likely to loose data. For crypto, loosing some bytes is about equal to loosing all data. Dont' forget that ciphertext looks like random data, so bytes can have any value, including ""fun"" values such as 00, 7F, space, tab, etc. etc. (and that's just for ASCII).
Note that simply encrypting/decrypting data is often not enough for a transport protocol. You will need to provide integrity/authenticity (e.g. a MAC or HMAC) as well.

"15542361","Space constrained asymmetric signature","I need to sign a small string with an asymmetric key encryption scheme.
The signature will be stored on a small chip together with the signed string. I have very little space to spare (about 60bytes for signature + string), so the generated signature should be as small as possible.
I looked around for how to do it, and what I found is that I could use RSA-SHA1, but the generated signature with a 512 bit key is 64 bytes. That is a bit much.
What secure algorithm could I use to generate a small asymmetric signature?
Would it still be secure if I store the SHA1 sum of the RSA-SHA1 signature, and later verify that instead?
","What you're bumping up against here is one of the properties of a good hash function - the return value should be long to protect against birthday attacks (where two different inputs result in the same output hash). Generally 128-512 bits is preferred hence the SHA-1 signature gives you 512 bits. 
As with all things in cryptography security is a trade off. As you are using asymmetric signing have you considered using RSA-MD5 as your signature option? This will give you a far shorter return of 128 bits but this comes with the caveat that MD5 is considered broken and is generally being moved away from.

"56798210","How can I decrypt text from one application in another application with asymmetric encryption?","I am trying to understand how I can decrypt a String in one application that I have encrypted in a separate application.  I can do this when I am in a single application execution, and I use the PrivateKey from the same KeyPair that generated the PublicKey.  However, I want to encrypt the value in one application, and decrypt the value in another application.  Basically I have a web service sending value I do not want to be tampered with to an application, and I was planning to use asymmetric encryption to handle it.  Feel free to let me know if I am going about solving that the wrong way.
I have tried various encryption techniques, starting with Symmetric.  The issue I ran into with that is that the value is encrypted to the same text each time - not very useful if my goal is to keep someone from tampering with a value - once they know the encrypted version of some text, they will be able to use that in any request.  I have been trying to follow the standards here - https://www.veracode.com/blog/research/encryption-and-decryption-java-cryptography
I can get all my examples working in a single transaction doing the encrypt/decrypt - it is just when I try to encrypt in one request, and decrypt in a second request that I fail.

I assume my issue is that I am re-generating a new KeyPair each time, which will only work the one time as a pair. So once I try to match a PrivateKey that came from one KeyPair to the text that was encrypted with an entirely different KeyPair, it fails.  But I have yet to find how you are supposed to otherwise achieve this in that case.

","As PHP docs example suggests the best way is to save signature to a file instead of copying it.
//create signature
openssl_sign($data, $signature, $private_key_pem);

//save for later

file_put_contents('public_key.pem', $public_key_pem);

"54707416","Client side public key encryption","We are building a mobile app that has the following functions

Capture user information (text, audio) while not connected to the internet
Store the information on the device, encrypted using a server-side public key
When internet connectivity is available, upload to s3 using pre-signed URL
Once the file is available in s3 another background process(?) decrypts it using the server-side private of the above public-key and copy to another bucket

Due to regulatory requirements, files on the device need to be encrypted at rest while not connected to the internet. Otherwise s3 encryption client (AmazonS3EncryptionClient) could be used for this purpose to encrypt on the fly when uploading to. 
My question is on step 4. Is it possible to use an s3 trigger lambda function for this step? I imagine the limit of available disk size for lambda will mean copying file from s3 to lambda local directory will not work for large files (the files can be few gigabytes large). What other options are available (preferably serverless)? What about streaming s3 object and decrypt in-memory?

Is it possible to use an s3 trigger lambda function for this step? ..  What about streaming s3 object and decrypt in-memory?

You may read-decrypt-write on s3 as a stream, then the lambda limitation will at the execution time (900s = 15 minutes). If you could process the file in 15 minutes, using lamba may be good idea. IMHO you can process a lot of GB in 15 minutes, but there's always the 15 min. limit (it was 5 minutes some time ago).

What other options are available 

If you want to process the files without any processing-time limit, I'd suggest to have the s3 lambda send a message to an AWS Job Queue

"55223916","Validate signature from public key, automatically detect algorithm in BouncyCastle","My question is: how can I write my signature validation function to be agnostic of the public key algorithm?
I'm working with .Net's BouncyCastle library (v1.8.4). I'm trying to validate a signature without knowing the algorithm in advance (but it's identification will be embedded in the public key).
I need to verify the signature for a byte stream and I've got the public key in PEM format:
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE7t7Uo4NB7kjqPGMzdXbBI66gy8rz
oYvRatFPTGsdS9lCru6imfdMclcr/hCkxHgfgz0ewmKqEjWK8EjZczUCEA==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

I expect it to inform the algorithm within the ASN.1 stream, which in this example parses like this:
$ openssl asn1parse -i -in pubkey.pem
    0:d=0  hl=2 l=  89 cons: SEQUENCE
    2:d=1  hl=2 l=  19 cons:  SEQUENCE
    4:d=2  hl=2 l=   7 prim:   OBJECT            :id-ecPublicKey
   13:d=2  hl=2 l=   8 prim:   OBJECT            :prime256v1
   23:d=1  hl=2 l=  66 prim:  BIT STRING

The algoritm is in this case is prime256v1 (secp256k1, etc.), but I won't know what is it in advance. Currently, my code looks like this:
Private Function SignatureChecks(data() as Byte, pubkey as String, signature as String) As Boolean

    Dim keypars As Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.AsymmetricKeyParameter 'impements ICipherParameters

    'Read and parse the PEM file into the proper object
    Dim pubkeybytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(pubkey)
    Using pubkeystream = New MemoryStream(pubkeybytes)
        Using reader = New StreamReader(pubkeystream)
            Dim pemrd = New PemReader(reader)
            'Now this is the decoded PEM for the public key
            keypars = pemrd.ReadObject()
        End Using
    End Using

    Dim signer As ISigner

    '*************************************************************
    'Currently this is hardwired: how can I make this intelligent?
    '*************************************************************
    signer = SignerUtilities.GetSigner(""SHA-256withECDSA"")

    'Init the signer with the public key
    signer.Init(False, keypars)
    'Appends the data to be verified in the SHA block buffer
    signer.BlockUpdate(data, 0, data.Length)

    'Get the bytes from the signature
    Dim sigbytes = Convert.FromBase64String(signature)

    Return signer.VerifySignature(sigbytes)

End Function

This code works fine, as long as the signature was made using the secp256k1 algorithm, which might not be the case. I've tried extracting the info from the AsymmetricKeyParameter object (which is actually an ECPublicKeyParameters), but it has very few public members. However, the relevant information does show in the internals of the object using the debugger: values like publicKeyParamSet=1.2.840.10045.3.1.7, algorithm=""EC"", etc.
Thanks in advance
","The prime256v1 algorithm informed in the public key is just the encryption algorithm (as it should be), while no hash algorithm is specified in either the public key or the signature. To verify the signature, a hash function (in this case SHA-256) must be agreed between the actors using other means. An example is CMS encoding (formerly PKCS#7), which is a container method that can embed all the information required to check the signature validity. Obtaining the encryption algorithm from the public key is not sufficient for performing the task.

i want encrypt the file and send it over the lan using both symmetric and asymmetric key approaches,an AES Encryption/Decryption First , then use RSA to Encrypt/Decrypt the symmetric key 

scenario example

johan wants to send Alice a file securely johan must log into the application with his username and password if registered. 
  If .not, johan must create a username and password If registered for the first time,
   johan must generate the pair of key's (Public key and .Private key). 
   Publish the public key and keep the private key secret To send the file to Alice,
   johan generates a random key from the application to use in the encryption process of the file using AES. 
   After the file encryption is done,
   johan uses Alice's Published public key to encrypt the key using RSA and sends the file .
   with the encrypted key When Alice receives the file,
   she must log into the application and uses her stored private key to decrypt the RSA encrypted key. 
   After that she uses the decrypted key to decrypt the file 

This is my code

but i have difficult to understand the encryption Libraries in c# i don't know from where i will start please  anyone help me

","I am not at a computer right now, but the easiest way to accomplish your scenario is to use SslStream on both ends.
On the server(Johan) once you have an incoming connection, you create an SslStream from the TcpStream. On the server, you will use SslStream.AuthenticateAsServer(), this method accepts an X509Certificate (this will be your private key). 
On the client(Alice) you will instead use SslStream.AuthenticateAsClient.
To both of these methods you can pass a Certificate Validation Callback. In your case you will only do this on client side, and check the given certificate is the one that was provided by Johan.
EDIT: I have reread your question and as you requested, I have created an example that first sends a key encrypted with RSA and uses that key to encrypt the following data
When some data is received, first the Key is decrypted, and then used for AES decryption. It is a very rough example, I have no registration and login and I have certificates stored so they both have private and public keys, but should be enough for you to accomplish your goal

Here is my question: Is there any crypto algorithm to generate a pair of keys so I can't generate the public one having the private? 
I would like to know if there is something like 
Private(ciphertext) = Encrypted 
Public(Encrypted) = ciphertext
Public(ciphertext) = Encrypted2
Private(Encrypted2)= ciphertext
And without generating the public from the private.
Thank you very much
","You can't conclude that because you have a private key then you can generate the public key. Take RSA as an example - here you can't deduct one of the keys in a key pair from the other - and which one is picked as the private key, and which is picked as the public key is random.
However, when storing the keys the private key file usually includes a copy of the public key as well (or enough information to recreate it).

"46972373","How dos ssh connects to an aws EC2 instance even though I didn't explicitly save the public key of the instance on the client?","As I understand the way ssh works is that the two parties agree on a symmetric key for each session. This agreement is done by using the parties' corresponding public key, so it assumes that each party has access to the public key of the other entity. For example, this happens using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. 
However, when sshing to an AWS instance, my client doesn't seem to have access to the public key of the instance (in that I didn't explicitly save it on the client), so how is the key exchange part of the ssh process completed?
","When ssh client connects to the server, the server presents its own public key to the client.  If the client does not have the public key, it can prompt the user to establish the trust with the host. If the user accepts the prompt, the client uses the public of the server and might save it locally for future ssh connections. You can typically see that key in ~/.ssh/known_hosts

","Sure.  Set up an alternative configuration file, and run sshd on another port while you are experimenting:

Now you can connect with:

","The protocols that OpenPGP uses are not different from what many libraries use.
If you only want to encrypt a string you shouldn't worry too much about this unles you are going to store the string somewhere.
What I would recommend is useing the pyAesCrypt module as It is easy to read and It makes use of the more complicated Cryptography module which is pretty much the basis in which many cryptographic libraries are based, It is also partially written in C.

","I too had this project, and I did this: 
First what you will need is to read the datas from the text file and save it to a list. You can use .split() which will do this : 
If the file contains only one line like this 
hello ! it will make it as 
list_of_the_file['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', '!']
Now as you have a list of all the letters that the file contains serially, you can use the ord() which will generate a unique value for each type of character for example a or more precisely ord(a) will give you the value 97 and it will return 97 only for the a present in the list not for any other character. Then you can apply the keys on that integer value and can store it in a list or a file. Hope this will help.

","Assuming the key is following the rules of making the modulus be between 2^(8n - 1) and (2^(8n) - 1) you only need to know the byte length for the modulus (then multiply by 8).
After removing any white space the answer would be:

Hexadecimal: the string length * 4 (length / 2 is bytes, * 8 to get bits)
Base64: ((length + 3) / 4) * 24 — or if you are only getting the =-padded version: length * 6 (length / 4 * 3 bytes, * 8 for bits, reduces to * 3 * 2 when the input is known to be a multiple of 4)
Decimal string: harder. Without a bignum library you can only bound it: it’s greater than length * 3.3, and less than length * 6.7 (or 3 and 7, if you prefer).

I understand that Public/Private keys are mathmatically interlinked properties. One can encrypt a message, the other can decrypt.
Everything I read e.g. Wikipedia, Quora, codeproject shows the public key being used to encrypt and private key to decrypt.
However, the practice exam I'm working on (MeasureUp) seems to change which is used. 
Sometimes the answers state to use the pubic key to encrypt, BUT sometimes they state to use the private key.
Example:

The application must communicate securely with the DMV. The DMV must
  be sure that data sent from your application was not modified in
  transit.

Answer to example: 

Generate a hash of the data. Encrypt the hash with
  the private key of your company. Send the data and the encrypted
  hash to the DMV.

The 'Show Answers' part then goes on to explain the above explicitly stating to encrypt with the private key.
Is it just the case that you have to consider what's public and what's private in context? 
e.g.
A) If it doesn't matter if other people can see the message just as long as they can't make one of their own - encrypt using the key you ""keep private"".
B) If other people can make a message, just as long as I'm the only one who can read it - encrypt using the publicly available key.
I feel like MeasureUp might have it wrong, but surely I'm more likely to be wrong than a big company.
Please can someone explain/ provide clarity on why this answer would be correct?

","Both keys can be used to en- and decrypt. The difference is: you should be the only one to have your private key. Everybody else can have the public key.
So if you encrypt something, everybody can be sure that the content was sent by you, because the public key can only successfully decrypt your message if it really was encrypted with your private key.
On the other hand, if someone wants to send you a message that only you can read, they will encrypt it with your public key. So only you  can decrypt it again (or someone who stole your private key).

However if there was a more complicated method something similar to machine learning could be applied where computer will detect these direct patterns. Google translations use a version of this to produce translations through pure maths and books that have been translated into multiple languages.
In addition if you are only shuffling numbers the sample space of encrypting something will be quite small.
eg. If the encrypted text is: 1342
Better encryption would mean it could have originally been 0 - 9999 (10,000 total)

1243 | 2143 | 3142 | 4132

1423 | 2413 | 3412 | 4312

1432 | 2431 | 3421 | 4321

Finally:
Because the ""secrecy"" of your encryption comes from people not knowing how perform it you cannot ask the community to examine its strength without them knowing how you did it and thus cracking it.
All good encryption methods ""secrecy"" comes from a key or password which means you can share the method and ask the community to test its strength because you don't give them the key.

"39475201","Secure URL parameters when an application delegates the user (concept)","Context
We have an application A that guides our customer consultants throught a workflow based process. Part of this process has been outsourced to a own webapplication - lets call it application B.
Wenn calling application B the certificate of the current user is used for the HTTPs connection (since it just delegates the HTTP GET to a new browser window). 
Application A has the required data to autorize users to perform certain actions while application B expects the autorization to be done once a URL is called. 
Application A must as well deliver certain data such as IDs to enable application B to know for example what customer is beeing processed. 
Requirements
That application B can expect the autorization to have been done it must be ensured that only application A was the source of the call and the user has not changed the parameters of the URL (which he can as it is his certificate that is used for the HTTPS connection). 
What have we done
We thought of building a hash over the parameters, encrypt it with the private key of application A and submit it as additional parameter with any request. Application B uses the public key of application A to decrypt the hash, build a hash over the received parameter and check that parameters have not been changed. 
My Question
What would be other possibilities to ensure the source of the call was application A and the parameters have not been changed by the user?
(If not clear please leave a comment i am currently painting some grafics and can overwork the question). 
Regards
JBA
","So A signs the parameters for B, which is a step in the right direction.
A few more things to consider:

Replay attacks. A malicious user of B might observe a desired set of parameters signed by A. He can replay those anytime in the future, along with the valid signature from A, even if A did not intend to call B with those parameters anymore (say the authorization information changed). To mitigate this, a nonce or a timestamp should also be signed in the request and checked by B when validating the signature (the nonce should be checked for uniqueness, the timestamp for not being too old).
Participants (who's messaging whom). When A signs the message, the signed data should contain the intended recipient, so that an attacker cannot take a message from A to C, and send it to B. Of course if all of your components have a single instance, that's less of an issue, but still A should include something like the message is for B's url, and B should check that the url signed is actually the right one. Similarly, A should include the information that it was signed by A (his own url or IP address for example), and B should validate that the apparent and signed sender are the same.
Not creating a signing oracle. You should make sure that a user cannot use A as a signing oracle for making signatures. The less data a user of A can choose himself for A to sign, the better.

By the way (and apart from all of this), wouldn't it be simpler if B could just query A over some kind of an API request for all the information it needs? That way you wouldn't have to bother with all the relatively complex crypto stuff and would not have to pass sensitive info through the user.

","The host and username info at the end of the public key file generated by ssh-keygen is a comment.  You can edit it without affecting the key.  Its purpose is to help any recipients of the public key in remembering whose key it is.
That said, transferring a private key needs to be handled with some care.  Are your group members comfortable with the idea that you'll effectively have the ability to impersonate them (because you could have kept their private keys)?  
Could you solve this instead by scripting ssh-keygen for them, and pushing their resulting public keys to a publicly accessible place?
Edit: why is this tagged [ssl]? If you're planning on using SSL/TLS (instead of SSH) you don't want to make your keys with ssh-keygen.  You'll have a much easier time with openssl's key/cert-gen tools, e.g.:

I am getting error as bad public key.
If i used the encrypted variable instead of acutal in the eccrypto.decrypt(pk,encrypted)...
then i get the decrypted value.
","You can add a second argument to JSON.parse to allow you to inject code to help interpret the JSON as it's deserialized.   It's called a reviver in the documentation. 
You will get each key, value pair in the object.
Here is some sample code: 
JSON.parse('{""p"": 5}', (key, value) =>
  typeof value === 'number'
    ? value * 2 // return value * 2 for numbers
    : value     // return everything else unchanged
);

Here is mode info on MDN: 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse
In your example, I think you want to identify the values as type buffer and then replace them with UInt8Array

","Your N the modulus is too small to directly encrypt the message. For this to work N would need to be at least as long as the message in bits. Moduli with a million or so bits are quite impractical. I once tried 32786 bit RSA keys at the time it took a day to generate one key pair. This is why the message is encrypted with AES and the AES key is then encrypted with RSA. The AES key is a lot smaller than the message so keys with a few thousand bits suffice.

n_results = []

with open('nfile.pem', 'r') as f:

Also, utilize try-except block in case you have noise in your file that cannot be converted to integers. n_results return a list of all your values from your files which you can use to aggregate or combine them later for a single output.
This would be a better foundation as your project scales and if you deal with more data.

"49153121","MAKECERT and duplicate Public Keys","I hope this question makes sense. But let's say I create a Certificate with MAKECERT.EXE like this:
makecert -r -sr LocalMachine -ss my -a sha256 -sky exchange -n ""CN=Hello World""

Now let's say I run this on two different (Windows) machines. Statistically what are the chances the certificates on the two different machines will have the same Public Key?
If this question does not make sense, I'd appreciate an explanation as to why it doesn't.
Thanks.
","
makecert defaults to a 1024-bit RSA key.
It defaults to a fixed e=65537.
A 1024-bit RSA key has two primes, each 512 bits long.
The Prime Number Theorem says that there are more than 2^511/ln(2^511) primes of that size, and if we subtract all the 511-and-smaller bit primes we're left with about 10^151.
So across two runs, the odds of the smaller of the two primes being the same is about 1 in 1e151.
Running that through the formula for the birthday problem we see that all the magic really happens around the 1e75 mark.


1% chance of collision: 4.5e74
10%: 1.5e75
25%: 2.4e75
50%: 3.7e75
75%: 5.3e75
99%: 9.6e75

All of that was for one of the two primes.  If we factor in the other (and, without-loss-of-generality, assume that we always declare that p < q) then we get:


5e150 * 1e151 ~= 5e301 different 1024-bit values of RSA n.
1% collision chance after 1e150 runs.
10% collision chance after 3e150
25% collision chance after 5e150
50% collision chance after 8e150
75% collision chance after 1e151
99% collision chance after 2e151


At 1 million keys per second (1e6) for all ~86000 seconds per day you get 8.6e10 keys per day.  To have a ""millionth of a percent"" chance (1/1e8) of a collision you'll need over 1e136 days of computation. That's 3e133 years.  The universe, currently, is believed to be 1.4e10 years old. So, you need about 2.3e123 universes to have even that high of a chance (give or take a couple universes).
BTW, my computer can only do ~100 1024-bit keys per core-second (right around 10ms per), so I'm assuming you have about 10,000 of them chugging away at this problem.
Unless we model in CSPRNG state collision and VM rollback (to cause CSPRNG state collision), the answer is: effectively impossible.

","You have made just about every mistake in the book here.
        InputStream is =  fis;
      //long length = file.length();

        byte[] bytes = new byte[fis.available()];

InputStream.available() is not an indicator of the length of the input stream. See the Javadoc, which contains a specific warning against exactly what you are doing here. You can practically always use a fixed size buffer when doing I/O of any kind, and it is rarely if ever necessary to read entire files into memory. Compilers don't do it: why should you?
        int offset = 0;
        int numRead = 0;
        while (offset < bytes.length
               && (numRead=is.read(bytes, offset, bytes.length-offset)) >= 0) {
            offset += numRead;
        }
        is.close();
        file=null;

The file = null; statement is pointless here, and the entire loop can be elided as I will show below.

String is not a container for binary data.

                for(int i=0;i<noOfBlocks;i++){

I have no idea what all this is supposed to be doing, but you should not be using blocks of 110 bytes, or characters, or whatever they are, or converting encrypted data in the form of a byte array to String, and you should not be appending four spaces to it.

Here you could just have written the original byte array resulting from the actual encryption and avoided the whole problem.

","Whether a file contains tables or other structures is completely irrelevant for modern encryption, because it works on binary data which is already serialized from the ""document"".
You're trying to apply RSA for some chunks of the original file. This is very tricky to get right, because you have to make sure that the input is smaller than the RSA modulus taking the padding into account. Then you have to make sure that each ciphertext chunk has exactly the same length so that you know which bytes belong to which chunk during decryption. In RSA it is not guaranteed that the output will always have the same number of bytes. It can be smaller compared to the padded input. So you would need to pad the ciphertext chunks consistently. 
A better idea would be to use hybrid encryption. You could use AES to encrypt the actual data and use RSA to encrypt the randomly generated AES key. A simple format should be easy to do: 
4 bytes - Length of the RSA-encrypted AES key (= x)
x bytes - RSA-encrypted AES key
remaining bytes - AES-encrypted file

Of course, if you're doing AES encryption, you would have to think about the mode of operation, the padding mode, how to handle the initialization vector and whether you want to add authenticated encryption.

Encryption and decryption should be done via the Bouncy Castle cn1lib. You can see a sample of that here.
Codename One has a share button API and a share API that works with text and images.
The last question is a bit problematic. Mobile devices don't have a file system in the way desktop OS's have them. Every app runs in its own locked down environment and can't really access other files. I suggest rephrasing the question in more general terms explaining what you are trying to achieve ideally with examples of apps that already do that.

Is there any sdk that can help? With web3 is possible only to sign with private key..
","The term ""sign"" in public-key cryptography has a very specific meaning: it generally means the generation of a digital signature to verify the content and sender of a given message.
It sounds like what you're describing when you say ""SIGN"" is that you want to encrypt a message with the ETH address / public key, and decrypt the message with the wallet private key.
In public key cryptography, you encrypt with the public key and decrypt with the private key.

I'm struggling in finding the best library to do this: i've seen openpgp and JEncrypt but both requires to have ""public / private"" keys specified in some particular format.

Public and private keys will need to be in the proper format for any pgp implementation, and this is likely the problem with ETH addresses, because the ETH address is derived from the underlying key pair.

","See Probabilistic Encryption WRT block ciphers .
An example of different results encryption the same data in a block based encryption algorithm such as AES and CBC mode with a random IV. The IV can be prefixed to the encrypted data and the encrypted data will be different because there is a different IV each time the same data is encrypted, this is a common and good standard practice, the IV does not need to be secret.
If the IV can be prepended to the encrypted data it is available for decryption, no prior agreement ios required.
Here is CBC mode, notice that the IV is xor'ed with the first block of data and each subsequent block is xored with the previous encrypted block. Thus the IV affects every block of the encrypted data.
This is done so that two identical messages will not have the same encrypted data. Consider the case where one of two messages is sent on an on-going basis: ""0"" or ""1"" where 0 meant sell and 1 meant buy. If the encryption were the same each time even though the message themselves could not be determined the two states could be determined and which one it was.
Travis-ci uses aes-256-cbc for it's Automated Encryption.
There are other encryption options such as asymmetric encryption such as RSA that can use random padding.

The Problem
I want to encrypt some files in my server, after asking other people, i realized that the most recommended method is encrypt those files (larges) using a private key.
Now, i was looking for the docs and saw these methods

crypto.publicEncrypt(pubKey, buffer)
crypto.publicDecrypt(pubKey, buffer)
crypto.privateEncrypt(privKey, buffer)
crypo.privateDecrypt(privKey, buffer)

this is very confusing because i don't know what of them i must to use now, ahm... i don't know what is the most appropriate way to do this securely.
","tl;dr encrypt with the public key. Keep your private key safe.
Unfortunately, these methods are poorly named. privateEncrypt should be called something like sign and publicDecrypt should be called something like verify.
When using public-key encryption (also known as asymmetric encryption), one key can be used to write a cipher and the other key can undo that operation. Your public key is potentially known to everyone, and your private key is secret.
If you want to keep something secret, except from the owner of a certain key, you want to encrypt a message with their public key. So if Alice wants to receive encrypted messages, she'll share her public key A_pub and her secret key A_priv, she'll keep to herself.. You'll encrypt your message crypto.publicEncrypt(A_pub, buffer). She'll then decrypt that message with crypto.privateDecrypt(A_priv, buffer).
Doing it the other way is known as a digitial signature.

","You should specify the options in front of the hostname, as the manual page for ssh(1) hints:

 ssh [...] [-L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport]

The parsing of arguments after the hostname can be suppressed or omitted since it is not according to specification.
You should rather use:

"58595346","How should I encrypt passwords for API access without showing off the algorithm to the client?","I have a REST API (.net) which for the initial login requires the password to be encrypted (RSA with OAEP).  The reason was to obscure the users passwords from local logs.
Performing this encryption with javascript is complicated and I would need to let the client know the public key.  The end user would be able to reverse engineer the encryption method then could use it to brute-force (or worse) access.  So why bother, right (it is SSL Secure).
Thing is, I still need that password to be encrypted.  Should I have some sort of encryption service at the server side that gives me the password to throw at the token endpoint?  Why not have the service just log in for me then return the token.  How should I proceed?
Thanks ^_^
","This seems like a general authentication question. You can solve it like you would solve user authentication. Think of it this way:
When a user signs-in into your app, they provide their data on the client, and then it is validated on the server. In order for them to stay logged in, they get some sort of token, either via a Cookie session, JWT or whatever. Which is then saved on the client and sent on each request to the server in order to verify they are authenticated. 
The above is how websites can show ""registered users only"" content. By validating a previously given token on each new request.
Now, applying this method to your REST Api. A user needs to request a token (which should not be your master password, but a uniquely generated one, in a per-user basis), and then save it locally for X amount of time. Every time the user makes a request to the API they send that token, which is validated. 
This is also how normal APIs do it. You will need a token or some sort either way. If it's really sensitive information you're showing, the token should update every now and then (from minutes to days depending on how sensitive). You keep a record of valid tokens in your server. That way, if any token is ""stolen"", then it will only be valid for a small amount of time.

I have another class that decrypts the string that is stored in the database, but it doesn't decrypt the encrypted value, and I know that is because it doesn't have the right key to do it.
I tried making the KeyPair a static variable so both of my custom classes, StringEncryptor and StringDecryptor use the same object of keypair but that stops working properly when the server restarts, so I believe when the server restarts, the static KeyPair object which I used to encrypt/decrypt gets reinitialized so that's not the key which locked the String variable.
I'm not sure but I kind of think I should store the key that I locked the String objects with, so I can use it again later in other classes to unlock the encrypted Strings.
most of the tutorials on the internet are about cipher algorithm and others decrypt the encrypt the file in the same method which is totally useless in real-world projects and that's not what I'm looking for.
I need to know how to store and where to store and how to retrieve these keys back again for decrypting. 
Thanks in advance.
","Key management is a whole topic onto itself. You've already discovered, I hope, that keeping keys in RAM is not an option.
Commonly you would try and put the key in a key store. This key store may be backed by hardware. In that case the actual private key operations also need to take place in hardware, or you'd have to take out the key. In the simplest form the key can simply be retrieved from a password protected key store (which would mean a PKCS#12 compatible file for latest versions of Java). Now you can store keys, but the problem is that you'd have to enter the password on restarts. 
Furthermore, generally Java KeyStore implementations also require a certificate to be present with the private key, so you'd have to generate or request a certificate for your private key. There are many tutorials on how to create a self signed certificate from a key pair. This is because Java relies heavily on PKIX, the public key infrastructure according to the US ANS(I) standards, which all start with the letter X (such as X.509 which defines what common TLS / CMS certificates look like).
OK, so now you know what direction you should look at, I'm afraid that you'll have to do some research from here on on how to manage your keys.

for messageToInt = 15000: dec = 2068. (what?!).

","Actually, it worked perfectly:
15000 mod 3233 = 2068.

Since RSA relies on modular arithmetic, you are restricted to plain texts that are smaller than n. There is no way to distinguish whether the plain text was 2068, 2068 + n, 2068 + 2n, and so on.
The solution is here to either split the plain text into parts that are smaller than n, or increase n until the plain text fits in there.

How will the communication occur? Meaning how will they authenticate each other who will give the key to who how will the encryption occur?
","It can't. The bank must have a pair of key (private and public) representing the bank, and the client must also have a pair of keys representing the client. If only the bank has a pair of key only the banks identity can be verified. Example: the bank sends a public message to all clients and signs it with its private key. All the clients can by using the banks public key indeed verify that the message comes from the bank.
 However a client can also send an encrypted message to the bank using the banks public key, and only the bank can indeed read this message by using its private key, but the bank can not determine the identity of the client.
The clients identity can of course be determined by other means for instance by a login credentials.

","Broadly:
For Asymmetric encryption you must first generate your private key and extract the public key.
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private.key 8912
openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -out public.key

To encrypt:
openssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin -inkey public.key -in plaintext.txt -out encrypted.txt

To decrypt:
openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey private.key -in encrypted.txt -out plaintext.txt

"23420140","Securely verifying 2 messages from a source - which algorithm?","I am working on a project where:

The sender sends a single 256-bit public key to multiple clients
The sender then sends a second message (of any size) over another medium to these clients
Clients will have sufficient details to pretend that they are the sender, except for the private key from the first public key
The first 256-bit public key must have a huge scope for randomness, as we will be SHA2'ing it and using it for passwords

I need to verify that the second message is from the sender, and not from a malicious client.
What is the type of encryption algorithm I am looking for? I want to embed a verifying key in this second message, so that non-malicious clients can verify that the sender (or someone with the private key) sent both messages, and not another client.
","The cryptographic primitive you are looking for are public key signatures. They do exactly what you have described, but I'll add few remarks to your points:

Re 1: The first channel you use has to be secure in some sense so no attacker can not pretend to be the server in the first step already. An example for such a secure connection would carrying it via usb stick by yourself if the other side knows you as a person. Or if they are all software installations of your code you can embed the public key in the source code (assuming the software arrives at the client in a secure fashion). Regarding the key size: 256bit keys are very short for most public key signature schemes. For elliptic curve schemes 256bit is lower minimum, for RSA you now need keys with 2048bit.
Re 4: The public key will have a lot of entropy (the technical term for ""huge scope for randomness""), but non the less it is bad practice to reuse keys for several applications. Why don't you just transmit the (independently generated) passwords in the first step already?

        print(enc)

I adapted encrypt_rsa() function from Google document. And I got this error:
TypeError: initializer for ctype 'unsigned char *' must be a cdata pointer, not dict

So I tried printing the json data that I queried, which turned out to be single-quoted like this: {'data':'abc'}, which is weird because JSON format should use double quotes. So I tried query in pSQL and got double-quoted data {""data"":""abc""}. I am not sure that is the reason for the error or not.
My question here is

It seems like psycopg2 converts my JSON result to single-quoted text instead of the default double quote. So, how can I force a double quote like normal? 
If it becomes double-quoted and the error still occurs, how can I encrypt a JSON database with what I have tried on my code?

","When sticking to AWS, for authentication you may want to have a look at the Cognito service. It's effectively a complete identity management (managing users, groups,..)  with federation options and social network logins.  For public access it has generous free tier and reasonable pricing.  (you will need to learn about OAuth and chew through Cognito documentation) 

want to be able to authenticate a user without a database

Now you are using S3 as a database (datastore). As you found you need to store your data somewhere. 
From your use case I assumed you want to validate a secret (password?) to authorize an action.  If you want to go completely serverless without any database, you may want to use the lambda environment variables to store some secret ( e.g. salt, password hash,. .). 
IMHO it may be still feasible to send a secret along the request to authorize an action (that's done  with API key or basic auth) , but I won't advice putting it into url. It could be in payload, header, anything that is not directly cached or logged.  

I do not know which libraries can do this

For symmetric encryption and hashing I use crypto-js, however this library doesn't support RSA or PBKDF. 

I am not good at encryption subject, I have some  understanding only so I'm not sure if this can work. And how can I make it on nodejs

Unfortunately cryptography is broad topic and it's easy to shoot yourself in the leg.
For each topic I'd advice to search the net, try it out and then create a new specific question when you have a problem

"27730312","Encrypt other person's public key to reduce overall needed key size, viable?","I need to use RSA encryption in a environment where byte size of the keys are important. 
I don't want to risk security breaking, so I wondered if you could have one person transmit his key first using (2048 bit) and then have the other transmit his key of size (256bit) encrypted with the other guy's key. And if this would still provide a secure scheme?
PS: I realize 256 bit would increase from the encryption and you can ignore the man-in-middle problem.
TL;DR: Does keeping public key secret allow for a smaller key size?
","Typically one would use RSA and other asymmetric algorithms specifically for the purpose of exchanging keys.  The security of RSA has to do with factoring large primes, which is why their key sizes are typically so much longer than symmetric keys for algorithms such as AES.  What you don't want to do is reduce the RSA key size in your scheme.  So if what you're doing is creating a 256 bit AES key and then using AES thereafter for encryption I think the security scheme will work.  Public key cryptography is much slower than symmetric encryption therefore for performance and other reasons you don't want to use RSA.
As to your question regarding keeping the public key secret, I think that goes against what RSA is meant for.  A public key is meant to be public.
The implementation can have failings as well, for example SSL 3 was found to have a padding oracle vulnerability in 2014.  I would suggest you use a standard implementation like TLS rather than trying to make your own protocol.  Secure protocols are typically the most difficult problems in cryptography.

","RSA is not suitable for encrypting more than limited amounts of data. The conventional solution is hybrid encryption where the data is encrypted with a symmetric cipher with a nonce key and RSA is used to encrypt (only) the key.

I do not want to use a different public-private-key-pair for data publishing part, especially in this scenario it means making public a private key. It already sound awkward when typing...
EDIT: Is there an asymetric encryption contained in .NET framework which allows me to use both keys (public and private) in both directions where if one key is used for encryption only the other one can be used to decrypt?
","RSA signing is not the same as encrypting with the private key.
PKCS#1 v1.5 signature:

Hash the content with a chosen algorithm.
Create a DigestInfo value to represent the hash.
Apply padding to make a message almost, but not quite, the size of the modulus (details omitted here).
Apply the RSA primitive with the private key

Note that last step doesn’t say “encrypt”.
The RSA classes in .NET do the padding and such for you, so they expose Sign/Verify and Encrypt/Decrypt. You can’t use them for cross purposes, and you can’t use these classes for the RSA primitive (aka “raw RSA”).

val spec = KeyPairGeneratorSpec.Builder(context)

This works fine, and if I get the public key and convert it to hex it looks something like this:
30819F300D06092A864886F70D010101050003818D00308...

The problem is that when I'm testing this using android instrumentation tests running on AVDs, the key is always the same, which I didn't expect because I'm using something called SecureRandom as a source (I would have thought that would use something like the current time to help generate entropy?). I've tried wiping the data on the AVDs, using different AVDs, changing the alias, I always get the same key, suggesting it's using a static seed (this doesn't make any sense to me - the name of the class is SecureRandom, and it doesn't seem to be at all secure?)
There are a couple of similar questions which don't help:

This one: The suggestion here is to not specify a provider when getting the KeyPairGenerator instance. This doesn't seem to make any difference.
This one: Apparently adding something called spongycastle as a provider solved the problem - I don't really want to add a 3rd party library to do this, especially one that looks like it's pretty ancient and no longer maintained

PS If I delete the key pair:
val keyStore: KeyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""AndroidKeyStore"")
keyStore.load(null)
keyStore.deleteEntry(""MyKeyAlias"")

And generate another key, I get a new and different key. But this obviously doesn't help - the first key is always the same.
What am I doing wrong? I suspect the SecureRandom.getInstance(""SHA1PRNG"") but is crucial, but I don't know what to try. Thanks!

My first approach was to copy my /home/user/.ssh folder from the (already set-up) server to the new one. This one obviously fails, I found out with ls -a , that in my .ssh directory is only one file - known_hosts.
Im bit confused from my search results, is it necessary to create a new private-public key pair (I dont have any log about creating in before for the first server, so it was probably already setup for me), or is it sufficient to copy files from the first server and setup owners and permissions? 
","What you're probably looking for is file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the server. If you have your key set up, your public key should be stored there. If there is no such file, than you don't have your keys set up(do you have private keys files on your desktop?).
Please note that for usually ssh will require strict access permissions(rwx for user only) for your ~/.ssh directory and authorized_keys file.
Also you can use as many and as few keys as you wish, depending on your security needs. So using single key pair for multiple servers is possible.

I then keep the private_key on my machine and share it with no one.  I then go to GitHub and paste in my public_key.

Do they use my public_key to encrypt a message and then wait for me to send back the decrypted message?

Rather the other way around. You (your local SSH client) encrypt something using your private key. And if they are able to decrypt it using the public key you gave them, it must be you.
Obviously this is a very simplified explanation.
For details, see

I don't have CSR from user, I only have his public Key, and I want to certify it.
How can i certify this public key with OpenSSL (command line) or .net (with C# programming)?
EDIT: To be more exact I need to sign users public key, with CA private key, then build X509 text file and convert it somehow to .PEM or .DER file
","You can verify that the certificate is correctly signed with openssl but it depends on the format of the certificate.  If I ""assume"" the certificate is in PEM format.
e.g.
openssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -text

will dump information stored in the certificate.  If anythning is incorrect it will ""error"" out.
You can check if the certificate is expired with:
openssl x509 -enddate -checkend 0 -noout -in cert.pem
This will display the end date (in utc) and if the certificate has expired.
You can also check that the certificate ""chain"" is correct using the verify openssl command.
e.g.
openssl verify cert.pem

although you may need to include intermediate certificates and a calist if required.
e.g. This is an example of veriying a GoDady signed certificate chain:
openssl verify -CAfile .\gdroot-g2.crt -untrusted .\gdig2.crt.pem -show_chain .\server.pem
.\server.pem: OK
Chain:
depth=0: OU = Domain Control Validated, CN = *.XXXX.XXX (untrusted)
depth=1: C = US, ST = Arizona, L = Scottsdale, O = ""GoDaddy.com, Inc."", OU = http://certs.godaddy.com/repository/, CN = Go Daddy Secure Certificate Authority - G2 (untrusted)
depth=2: C = US, ST = Arizona, L = Scottsdale, O = ""GoDaddy.com, Inc."", CN = Go Daddy Root Certificate Authority - G2

Most of this is done for you when you establish a SslStream connection.
As for trying to do all this is code (e.g. C#) you will have to be a lot more specific about what you want to do.  If you just want to know if C# can ""load"" a certificate, you can use the X509Certificate2Collection Import method to import a PFX formatted certificate chain.
Once imported you can pull out any attributes you wish to look at.
You can verify the chain using the X509Certificate2 Verify mathod.

"44063909","How does certificate authority initially authenticate public keys?","So when initially a client wishes to register his public key to a CA, he will need the public key of the CA, in order to send his own public key to the CA for registration. How does the client get the key?
And eventually when the client does manage to send his public key for registration, can a Man in the Middle attack not masquarade himself as the client and send his own public key instead of the clients?
I have a basic idea of how CAs work but do not understand how the initial registration of public keys can happen without any sniffing or spoofing.
","A Certification (or Certificate) Signing Request is signed by the requestor's private key. This prevents MITM tampering, but not MITM tamper + replace public key + re-sign.
The mitigating factor is that the request is usually then transmitted over TLS, providing tamper-proof delivery of the payload (and gives the sender a way of validating that the CA is the expected CA).
The TLS server auth certificate will eventually chain up to a certificate which was built into the OS / browser / other-client-trust-list.

Please explain. Thank you.
","I'm assuming you're asking whether the altered ciphertext should have thrown an error when decrypting. It looks like the altered string only adds two characters to the end and is otherwise the same string.
Your Base 64 library probably makes some reasonable assumptions when parsing Base 64 data. Base 64 works by encoding 3 bytes into 4 characters. If at the end the data length is not a multiple of 3 it must be padded. That is signalized by the = at the end of the encoded string. 
This also means that during parsing, the library knows that padding characters are at the end and stops parsing there. If the alteration appeared at the end of the string then the encoded ciphertext didn't effectively change.

Currently i am adding A public key to B 's authorized_keys

This is problematic because anyone - friend of foe - who has access to A's private key, implicitly has access to B.
What I suggest involves a simple setup with a single key pair

You have your own key pair
You copy your public key - and only that - to every server you want to access
On your box you add this to .ssh/config:
Host A
  ForwardAgent yes

You run ssh-add

At this point you can connect to A. Big woop, so what ? Well, if from A you connect to B, it will just work. This is very secure and there is a single key you have to worry about: your own.

","On A & B you firstly must already have generated your pubkeys with (assume you already have):
sudo ssh-keygen

Then use the command from machine A:
ssh-copy-id user@machineB -p <port #>

If you have generated a password for host B's private key you will have to enter that once and machine A's id_pub.rsa contents will be copied into machine B's authorized_keys.

Now, the question is, where do I need to store this key safely. Options that I can think of are web.config as it is not browsable, or keep it in a file. Both seems to be unsafe.
If I keep it in a file, can I save it into windows trusted store? If yes, how can I save it and since in the trusted store, I will have multiple such keys, how I will retrieve this particular key to encrypt the credentials next time when I need to encrypt.
I am using windows machine for production server and .NET to encrypt, just in case it makes difference.
","I think you can encrypt this certificate with another rsa key pair. Save key and encrypted data in different platform. For example save encrypted data in db and save rsa key in file system in protected folder. Protected folder can be user directory which has application user. Encrypt certificate out of the platform with separate tool. Don't save your rsa private key in application system.

Mike the mailman picks up the mail from the mailbox.  However, he doesn't want to lug the data all the way across the internet to Bob's place if bob isn't going to be able to decrypt it.
The question is, how can Mike ascertain whether the key has actually been encrypted using Bob's public key?
In my application I need to transport sensitive data to a data centre.  To achieve this, I have an upload process that accepts files (that have already been AES-encrypted with a key, then the key is encrypted with the recipient's public key) and sends them to the data centre.  The corresponding private key is held at the data centre and used to decrypt the files on receipt.  This is currently in the design stage so there is some flexibility on the public/private key technology to be used but it's likely to be a C# application that's doing the work.
I would like to protect against uploading files that have NOT been encrypted using the public key (because I may waste significant bandwidth and the receiving application at the datacentre will fail to decrypt them).
So, what I want to know is how can I tell at the sending end whether a file has been encrypted using a given public key?
In a nutshell, I have an encrypted file and a public key.  Has the file been encrypted with that key?
Thanks in advance etc.!

In HTTPS communication, the server is sharing it's public key with ""everyone""

","No. You use the public key to encrypt the data and it's not possible to decrypt it by using the same public key.
The only way to decrypt the data is by using the correspondent private key.
This wiki article explains the core.

","I am not very sure whether the OP is asking about SSL in general or the client authentication in SSL. (Note that @zaph is wrong. Client authentication is an optional part of TLS. [2])
In client authentication, client generates its own public and private key pair locally. The client then sends the CSR to a certificate authority to obtain a certificate. This certificate is sent to the server when the server requests it. The server verifies the certificate in the usual way (similar as how browsers verify server certificates). If the client cert is valid, the server can use the identification info present in the cert to determine whether to allow the client or not.

How server will authenticate C1 ?

C1 will authenticate the server with the help of the servers certificate and by using public key cryptography based on the public key contained in the servers certificate in the CA certificates which signed directly or indirectly the servers certificate.

Will there be only one public key for all the clients to encrypt the data ?

The data will not be encrypted with the public key. Instead each of the client is doing a key exchange with the server which will results in keys for symmetric encryption (and HMAC) specific to the connection between client and server.
For way more details I recommend that you study How does SSL/TLS work? over at security.stackexchange.com which is also the more suitable site to ask such question.

"57859621","Secure Communication Between Tomcat Servers","Note: this question was sort of asked here, but not answered.
I need to communicate securely between two Tomcat servers running in two different environments. I have control of both servers.
I would like to do this through a simple REST call from Server-B to Server-A.
On the server I am communicating to, Server-A, I can easily set up HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. If I import this certificate into the Java Keystore on Server-B, I can make a trusted HTTPS Rest call from my Java code on Server-B.
Good instructions for doing this can be found here:
https://blog.10pines.com/2017/09/25/how-to-communicate-via-https-between-two-tomcat-servers-using-a-self-signed-certificate/ 
I would also like to add a confirmation that the Rest call to Server-A is certainly coming from Server-B and the message has integrity.
My plan is to generate a self-signed certificate on Server-B and  import this certificate into the Java Keystore on Server-A. Then for any REST call from Server-B I will first generate an SHA-512 hash of the message and sign the hash with the private key associated with the Server-B certificate. When Server-A receives the message, the SHA-512 hash will be recalculated and checked for accuracy of the hash (no message tampering). I will then check the signature of the Hash against the public key of the certificate from Server-B.
For a little bit of extra paranoia I may encrypt the REST message with the public key of the certificate from Server-A; for short messages this should be fine (no need for Symmetric encryption).
Does this seem like a good plan? Does Tomcat have a simpler mechanism for doing this?
The Java Messaging API seems a little ""heavy"" for this use case.

The data is to be transferred between user and content provider anonymously though the proxy.  I have two questions.
1. If the user has a pseudonym based on its public key, can it apply for another public key?
2. For data confidentiality between user and content provider such that proxy cannot read the transferred contents, Diffie-Hellman key exchange can be used. But can I use the public key obtained in part 1 to get the encrypted data between user and content provider?
Best Regards
Alexandera
","Diffie-Hellman is a method for establishing a shared secret between two entities.
So, that's a part of secret key cryptography.
No number of public keys, unless you manage to generate the current shared secret, will get you the information shared between two parties using secret key crypto.  A public key should be matched to, and used with, a private key.  That's public key cryptography.
For part 1, I guess I don't understand what you want to do with the public key other than generate a pseudonym with it, I don't see why not.
Maybe I'm misunderstanding your question but I believe the answer for part 2 is no.

Authenticity You can use public-private key pairs for authentication in there own right, if I'm not mistake ssh does something similar. In fact you can setup servers in such away you do not need to enter a login password based on this principal. 
Integrity
I don't believe that the public -private key on its own accounts for this on its own.
Non-repudiation
Cannot be acchieved on its own without have a certifying body saying that the owner of the private key to which you encrypted your public key is the origin you expect it to be. For more
click here
Confidentiality 
the way it works is that you have public-private key pairs the 'public' have access to a key which they used to encrypt data but only one person has the private key to decrypt it. Therefore it brings about confidentiality only the intended person can read the data.

","GPG keyservers only store public keys. Their purpose is to distribute public keys and to help establish the web of trust. Are you also looking to centrally store private keys to allow for decryption and signing?
If you just want to run a keyserver like https://keyserver.ubuntu.com then you’re looking for something called the SKS keyserver. It’s hosted here: https://bitbucket.org/skskeyserver/sks-keyserver/wiki/Home Please note however, that this software looks to be very rough around the ages and non-trivial to deploy. The documentation is also not very good.
If you’re looking to centralize storage of your keyrings (ie your public and private keys) somehow, I’d recommend this as an alternative: https://superuser.com/questions/466396/how-to-manage-gpg-keys-across-multiple-systems It’s probably not exactly what you want, but it’s probably safest.
Suppose you have 3 servers, A, B and C, that all need access to private key K. Rather than copy private key K to all 3 servers, you could set up said key with 3 separate subkeys, one dedicated to each server, and then distribute the keys such that only the subkeys assigned to a specific server are on that server. That way, all servers can use the primary key, but through the use of their own dedicated subkey only, and if any of the servers get compromised, you can (in theory) just revoke the affected subkey, instead of having to revoke the entire key... I think... I may be wrong on this one, though.
Having said this, you might as well just create separate (primary) keys for each server and then use a master key to sign them to manage trust and revoke compromised keys, if necessary... the downside to this method is that each server would then have its own user id and a different key id, whereas with the subkey method, all servers would use the same key id and user id.
This page describes how to create a personal key with subkeys, and how to store the primary key securely:
https://alexcabal.com/creating-the-perfect-gpg-keypair/
I’d use this same principle to create sets of subkeys for each of your servers. Thus far I wasn’t able to find a guide to do this for multiple servers, or exact instructions on how to revoke a subkey without revoking the entire master key, so this scheme, while it sounds appealing in theory, may not be supported or very common... but it should work, though.

","Encryption Decryption Vs Digital Signature

In Encryption complete document or content is encrypted, transmitted and decrypted back by receiver.  In below image, for encryption, the public key (the green key) is used to encrypt, the private key (the red key) to decrypt.
In digital signing, hash of content is signed (hash encrypted using private key) so that receiver can decrypt using public key and verify hash by recalculating hash of content.  (unlike encryption and decryption, Hash can't give back content, its one way process.)

This process makes sure that
a. Author is one who claims it and 
b. Content or document has not changed since signing. (Changing a single char of content will change the hash!!)

","No, this is not possible with RSA. It's called a known plain text attack. 
It's important to use proper (OAEP) padding with RSA, or an attacker might be able to trick you into decrypting a message. But, this takes millions of attempts, and it only decrypts one message, it doesn't recover the key.

The loophole is if some unauthorized person comes to know my public key , then he could make a malicious WebService call. How can I prevent this?
","The public key in an asymmetric algorithm is expected to be exactly that - public and therefore expected to be known by everyone. If you are trying to implement authentication by only distributing the public key to ""authorized"" users then your mechanism is fundamentally flawed.
A more usual way to do this would be to have your clients each generate their own asymmetric key-pair and provide you with the public key, whilst keeping the private key secure. The clients can then authenticate themselves by signing a message with their private key, which you would validate with their public key.
This being said I would strongly suggest using something like TLS with client certificate authentication to implement secrecy, integrity and authentication at the transport level rather than attempting to roll your own cryptosystem at the application level. It's likely to be far more secure than anything you'd implement yourself as well as being far easier for your clients to implement.

","It looks like this parsing has skipped some of the fields and reordered others.
\x00\x044\x06 looks like the binary packet fields:
  uint32    packet_length
  byte      padding_length

(I think sequences like \00\x044 make this a pretty difficult representation to count bytes in.)
The cookie contents end up with this and the kex message number which I think is \x14 where they should be the 16 bytes after the message type right up to the name-lists that included \xa3\x00\x00\x01\x02. Also the size as parsed looks impossibly high.

The recipient would then decrypt (or verify) that data by decrypting it with your public key, thus indicating that the data really came from you, and then decrypting that data using their private key thus helping to ensure confidentiality.

"58071393","How to reproduce successful openssl_verify","My web app has an endpoint that receives a POST from a webhook, and the service that sends the payload also signs it using openssl_sign.
As you'd expect, I know the service's public key, so I use openssl_verify and check whether the ""signature"" sent to my endpoint matches the ""payload"" (""payload"" and ""signature"" are the parameter names).
It all works fine.
What I want to do now is write a functional test of my endpoint's controller. I want to prove that it properly handles when ""payload"" and ""signature"" are verified vs when ""payload"" and ""signature"" are invalid.
Since I do NOT have the service's private key, I can't generate my own values for the test case.
So I've used logging to see real-world values of ""payload"" and ""signature"".
But then when I use those values for my test, it fails!
I think the problem has something to do with line-break characters or whatever might not be captured 100% accurately by Laravel logging.
How can I capture EXACTLY what the production ""payload"" and ""signature"" are?
P.S. I also did this:
$payload = $request->input(self::PARAM_PAYLOAD);
Log::debug(sha1($payload));
Log::debug($payload);

And then when I look in the log for the $payload value and run sha1 on it, the hash is not the same as the logged hash of the original $payload.
","json_encode didn't help and serialize didn't help. What finally worked was:
$payload = $request->input(self::PARAM_PAYLOAD);
Log::debug(encrypt($payload));

Whether the corruption was happening because of linebreaks, single quotes, double quotes, or other special characters, apparently the encrypt function made it a non-issue.
So then I copied the encrypted payload value out of my log and pasted it into a const in my test.
And then I decrypted the payload prior to running the test. Pass!
I still don't understand the root cause of the problem, but at least this workaround helped.

Add a signature


We are not the first ones with that idea ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code )

needs connection to ""trusted third party"" (means: a web service)
Build Hash + TimeStamp -> send to third party -> sign the data (public-private-key stuff) -> send back

Best option so far

Add a signature with HMAC
Store the key in native code (not THAT easy to extract)
Get code obfuscation running and build some extra loops in C#
Every once in a while (5min?) put a signature into log AND into windows application log

QUESTION: would it be illegal for us to encrypt stuff using client's public key 
","Best consult a lawyer. But a lot of those legal sounding notices are completely unenforceable, they're just there to scare people. In general, once someone sends something without a prior agreement, the receiver owns it entirely, as long as the sender has ownership of it. That is regardless of whether the sender changes their mind after the fact. Post conditions, which you can only read after receiving something even if they are sent at the same time, are not a prior agreement (you need the option to decline) before the transaction).
The important part is what rights the sender has. It's possible the sender doesn't have the rights to ask you to use the key as they asked you to. Again, a lawyer can clarify, I don't think you would be liable for that infraction, but the notice might be enough to mean you ""should have known"", and might have some liability.
Even better, ask your customer for clarification. I'm surprised you didn't do that in the first place. If they offer to indemnify you - that is, take responsibility for all liability you might incur by violating that notice - you should be in the clear, providing a lawyer agrees.
I'll say ""lawyer"" again, because the legal system takes about ten years full time study for a lawyer to just get started knowing it well enough to start practicing, and decades longer to get good at it. You can't expect anyone with a casual opinion about it to know enough.

I understand the Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryptions on a basic level. With Asymmetric Encryption, it requires the Public key of the other user to encrypt it so only him/her can decrypt it with the Private key.
I don't understand how that would happen for a group or even a single user where both the encryptor and decrypter need the data/password.
Thanks for the help.
","Typically you encrypt the data itself (the password) with a random symmetric key. You then encrypt that key with each public key you want to provide access. Since passwords are small, in principle you could just encrypt the key directly with the public key, but it's pretty common practice to do the two-step process. Asymmetric encryption is very slow, and not convenient for use on large pieces of data. And if you have a large number of public keys, it's much better to just have a small piece of data (a symmetric key) encrypted multiple times rather than the whole data set.
If it's just a single user, there's no reason for asymmetric encryption. You'd just use symmetric encryption with a single key.

","To answer your question about what happens to the string during the process - the string is decoded into bits, then the bits are encrypted.  
Most modern encryption protocols ultimately use AES symmetric encryption to encrypt the message, using a secret key shared by both the sender of the message and the recipient.  The message is broken up into blocks of 128 bits (and usually padded), then the AES algorithm is used to encrypt these bits.  For information on how AES does this, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard.

The clients will submit preferences to the server and after some days if any two clients have the same preferences, they will be notified -- not in any other case. A fool-proof framework design needs to be built for this purpose. What I am willing to do is to ensure my clients that even though they will be submitting their favourite responses to me via my website, I will still not be able to see those as if I would, this application will have issues of privacy. I am trying to match the user preferences with each other, they will obviously be encrypted and there is no way I can match any two unless I decrypt them at some point in my server locally -- assuming the fact that RSA encryption mechanism has a very little probability of collision of hashed values and I definitely cannot match them :) . The bottleneck here then is >> never ever decrypt the client preferences locally on the admin's machine/server. One approach which is currently on my mind is to introduce a salt while encrypting which will stay safe in the hands of the client, but still decryption needs to be done at some point in time to match these hashes. Can there be some alternative approach for this type of design, I think I might be missing something.
","Turn things around. Design a mailbox-like system and use pseudonyms. Instead of getting an email once a match has been found, make people request it.

I.e.: In order to post preferences, I'll leave a public key to contact me. The server searches matches and posts encrypted messages to a public site. Everyone can see these messages (or not, if you design properly) but I am the only one that can read them.

So your two easiest options are to know the password, or to try to crack the RC2 payloads.

Simulating an attack,  I have installed Burpsuite on the local machine and intercepted the traffic, modified it and sent it on to the end point (even though it is encrypted with SSL). What is the best way (quickest / cheapest!) to secure the application against this sort of vulnerability?
","I think you can intercept the unencrypted traffic because Burp does a SSL MITM...if someone can use burp on a machine this means they have high privileges...so it's not a question of application security but system security: low level privilege of the users that are using the client.
You can add another layer of encryption in your rich client, but you need to store the encryption key somewhere in the client and also in the server side. Storing the encryption key in the rich client is not so much secure because it's easy to decompile .NET code or execute it in a debug env to catch the key. Also with an obfuscation layer. 
You can evaluate to use asymmetric encryption: a key pair with a public and private keys. You can encrypt secrets with the public key in the rich client and only the server will be able to decrypt them with the private key. But it depends on secrets you want to protect.
Because the asymmetric encryption is slower than the symmetric one, you can encrypt a session symmetric key and share with the server.
But if someone can decompile your rich client they can rewrite your code and do what they wants!

To bind a domain name to a specific organization
To send out a public key for encryption

These functions seem very different to me. What is missing from my understanding of the model?
Update for clarity: I base my question on findings from searches. For example, one source says, “SSL Certificates bind together: A domain name, server name or hostname. An organizational identity (i.e. company name) and location.” And, other sources discuss encryption.
","SSL has none of the functions to describe. What you describe are only parts of how the actual functionality is achieved. The real function of SSL is to protect the data in transit. 
The certificate with subject and key is needed within this function (at least) to authenticate the server in order to make sure that the client talks to the expected server and not to some man in the middle. This is achieved by making sure that a) the certificate is issued by a trusted party (the certificate authority) and that it is issued to the expected domain, i.e. the same one which is included in the visited URL.
Note that SSL does not make any claims about how trustworthy the site or the party behind the certificate is. It also does not make any claims if the organization you expect is really the one which owns the visited domain. The latter part is done by the certificate authority for some kind of certificates, i.e. the EV certificates. But for most certificates it is only checked that the current owner of the domain requested the certificate and not who the owner actually is.

"58459374","How many public/private key pairs needed on server & best way to generate these in Express.js?","I'm just getting started in researching the topic of assymetric encryption and public/private key pairs, etc. and my head is spinning so apologies in advance if the related questions below are very basic. 
By way of background, I've been following along with an excellent tutorial https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-jwt-authentication/ on encryption and setting up JWT's. The sample code largely applies to third-party-hosted authentication, but before I try that I'd like to try handling the authentication on my own Express back-end first. So my questions below are related solely to authentication in my own Express back-end.
My understanding of the authentication process is that we sign the JWT on the back-end using the RSA_PRIVATE_KEY, pass the JWT to the front-end as a json response to the authentication POST, and then for subsequent requests, the server validates the incoming JWT using the RSA_PUBLIC_KEY. With this in mind, I have three questions as below:   

The first thing that's not clear to me relates to how many key pairs are needed. For example, let's assume our app has many thousands of users, each with multiple sessions per day. My preliminary understanding is that the server only needs ONE private/public key pair to sign and verify all the JWTs -- for all user sessions for time-immemorial -- but I'd like to make sure my understanding is correct, and if not, is a separate public/private key pair needed per user? or even per session?  
Regardless of how many key pairs are needed, what's the best way (or some options) to do this within Express? When I do a web search, I don't see anything specific related to Express. I see a number of CLI solutions, such as openssl, and I see several packages for Node.js, such as crypto (but most of the posts for those are quite old). A more recent posting is this one: How to generate Public/Private key pairs using openssl in nodejs?, but that solution still uses the command line to generate the key pairs. I raise this question because I assume the key pairs should be rotated periodically, and I'd think it wouldn't make sense to have to manually re-generate pairs at the command line on a periodic basis, so wouldn't it make sense to automate the key pair generation in the back-end itself?  
A final bonus question is: since both the PRIVATE and PUBLIC keys remain on the server at all times in the authentication deployment I've outlined above, is it fair to say that the PUBLIC key is not really ""PUBLIC"" in this case? (or am I misunderstanding something?).

Many thanks in advance for shedding light on these issues, and helping a beginner come up to speed with this topic!!

As above, both comment and version tags are regularly used, including others, as per RFC4880, allowed Armor Header Keys include:
 - ""Version"", which states the OpenPGP implementation and version
   used to encode the message.

 - ""Comment"", a user-defined comment.  OpenPGP defines all text to
   be in UTF-8.  A comment may be any UTF-8 string.  However, the
   whole point of armoring is to provide seven-bit-clean data.
   Consequently, if a comment has characters that are outside the
   US-ASCII range of UTF, they may very well not survive transport.

 - ""MessageID"", a 32-character string of printable characters.  The
   string must be the same for all parts of a multi-part message
   that uses the ""PART X"" Armor Header.  MessageID strings should be
   unique enough that the recipient of the mail can associate all
   the parts of a message with each other.  A good checksum or
   cryptographic hash function is sufficient.

   The MessageID SHOULD NOT appear unless it is in a multi-part
   message.  If it appears at all, it MUST be computed from the
   finished (encrypted, signed, etc.) message in a deterministic
   fashion, rather than contain a purely random value.  This is to
   allow the legitimate recipient to determine that the MessageID
   cannot serve as a covert means of leaking cryptographic key
   information.

 - ""Hash"", a comma-separated list of hash algorithms used in this
   message.  This is used only in cleartext signed messages.

 - ""Charset"", a description of the character set that the plaintext
   is in.  Please note that OpenPGP defines text to be in UTF-8.  An
   implementation will get best results by translating into and out
   of UTF-8.  However, there are many instances where this is easier
   said than done.  Also, there are communities of users who have no
   need for UTF-8 because they are all happy with a character set
   like ISO Latin-5 or a Japanese character set.  In such instances,
   an implementation MAY override the UTF-8 default by using this
   header key.  An implementation MAY implement this key and any
   translations it cares to; an implementation MAY ignore it and
   assume all text is UTF-8.

What would be the best user experience to submit such a key ?
Presumably the request body attribute is a String, so it can be convenient for using through curl for instance
I guess for HMAC it would be Base64#encode(keyBytes).
For RSA/ECDSA I'm kinda confused.
https://www.cryptosys.net/pki/rsakeyformats.html
Specifies that RSA public key may be either X.509, XML or PKCS#1.
So, is base64 a good choice here as well ? or it should be some kind of US_ASCCI / iso-8859-1 string ?

The assumption is that the user may come later and GET the keys, so it would be nice if he see the same values he submitted earlier (avoiding any string alteration due different text encoding)
