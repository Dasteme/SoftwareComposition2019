"2643502","How to solve Permission denied (publickey) error when using Git?","I'm on Mac Snow Leopard and I just installed git.
I just tried 
git clone git@thechaw.com:cakebook.git

but that gives me this error:
Initialized empty Git repository in `/Users/username/Documents/cakebook/.git/`
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

What am I missing?
I've also tried doing ssh-keygen with no passphase but still same error.
","the user have not generated a ssh public/private key pair set before ?
This info is working on theChaw but can be applied to all other git repositories which support SSH pubkey authentications. (See gitolite, gitlab or github for example.)

First start by setting up your own public/private key pair set. This
  can use either DSA or RSA, so basically any key you setup will work.
  On most systems you can use ssh-keygen.

First you'll want to cd into your .ssh directory. Open up the terminal and run:
  
  
cd ~/.ssh && ssh-keygen

Next you need to copy this to your clipboard.
  
  
On OS X run: cat id_rsa.pub | pbcopy 
On Linux run: cat id_rsa.pub | xclip
On Windows (via Cygwin/Git Bash) run: cat id_rsa.pub | clip

Add your key to your account via the website.
Finally setup your .gitconfig.
  
  
git config --global user.name ""bob""
git config --global user.email bob@...
  (don't forget to restart your command line to make sure the config is reloaded)


Thats it you should be good to clone and checkout.

Further information can be found on https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys (thanks to @Lee Whitney)
 -
the user have generated a ssh public/private key pair set before ?

check which key have been authorized on your github or gitlab account settings
tells which corresponding private key must be associated from your local computer

eval $(ssh-agent -s)
tell where the keys are located

Look at the keys listed in your authentication agent (ssh-add -l)

To verify that you have a key associated with your github account:
Go to: https://github.com/settings/ssh
You should see at least one key with a hash key matching one of the hashes you saw when you typed ssh-add -l just a minute ago.

","This error can happen when you are accessing the SSH URL (Read/Write) instead of Git Read-Only URL but you have no write access to that repo.
Sometimes you just want to clone your own repo, e.g. deploy to a server. In this case you actually only need READ-ONLY access. But since that's your own repo, GitHub may display SSH URL if that's your preference. In this situation, if your remote host's public key is not in your GitHub SSH Keys, your access will be denied, which is expected to happen.
An equivalent case is when you try cloning someone else's repo to which you have no write access with SSH URL.
In a word, if your intent is to clone-only a repo, use HTTPS URL (https://github.com/{user_name}/{project_name}.git) instead of SSH URL (git@github.com:{user_name}/{project_name}.git), which avoids (unnecessary) public key validation.

Update: GitHub is displaying HTTPS as the default protocol now and this move can probably reduce possible misuse of SSH URLs.

","Are you in a corporate environment?  Is it possible that your system variables have recently changed?  Per this SO answer, ssh keys live at %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\.ssh\id_rsa.pub.  So if %HOMEDRIVE% recently changed, git doesn't know where to look for your key, and thus all of the authentication stuff.  
Try running ssh -vT git@github.com.  Take note of where the identity file is located.  For me, that was pointing not to my normal \Users\MyLogin but rather to a network drive, because of a change to environment variables pushed at the network level.
The solution?  Since my new %HOMEDRIVE% has the same permissions as my local files, I just moved my .ssh folder there, and called it a day.

","Guys this is how it worked for me:
1- Open terminal and go to user [See attached image]
2- Open .ssh folder and make sure it doesn't have any file like id_rsa or id_rsa.pub otherwise sometimes it wont properly rewrite files
3 - git --version [Check for git installation and version]
4- git config --global user.email ""your email id""
5- git config --global user.name ""your name""
6- git config --list [make sure you have set your name & email]
7- cd ~/.ssh
8- ssh-keygen, it prompts for saving file, allow it
9- cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  [Access your public key & copy the key to gerrit settings]
Note: You should not be using the sudo command with Git. If you have a very good reason you must use sudo, then ensure you are using it with every command (it's probably just better to use su to get a shell as root at that point). If you generate SSH keys without sudo and then try to use a command like sudo git push, you won't be using the same keys that you generated

","I was struggling with same problem that's what i did and i was able clone the repo. I followed these procedure for iMac.
First Step : Checking if we already have the public SSH key.

Open Terminal.
Enter ls -al ~/.ssh to see if existing SSH keys are present:

Check the directory listing to see if you already have a public SSH key.Default public are one of the following d_dsa.pub,id_ecdsa.pub,id_ed25519.pub,id_rsa.pub
If you don't find then go to step 2 otherwise follow step 3
Step 2 : Generating public SSH key

Open Terminal.
Enter followong command with you valid email address that you use for github ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C ""your_email@example.com""
You will see following in terminal Generating public/private rsa key pair. When it prompts to""Enter a file in which to save the key,"" press Enter. This accepts the default file location. When it prompts to Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter] Just press enter again.
At the prompt, type a secure passphrase.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase] press enter if you don't want to Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again] press enter again

This will generate id_rsa.pub 
Step 3: Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent

Interminal type eval ""$(ssh-agent -s)""
Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent. If you are using an existing SSH
key rather than generating a new SSH key, you'll need to replace
id_rsa in the command with the name of your existing private key
file. Enter this command $ ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Now copy the SSH key and also add it to you github account 

In terminal enter this command with your ssh file name pbcopy <
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub This will copy the file to your clipboard
Now open you github account Go to Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key Enter title and paste the key from clipboard and save it. Voila you're done.

","Let me share my experience too, 
I was trying to clone some project from the Gerrit repo where I got my public keys in account settings.
On the first attempt to make git clone I got the following error:
Unable to negotiate with XX.XX.XX.XX port XXX: no matching key exchange
method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group1-sha1

I figured out that I need to pass the SSH option -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 somehow to git clone.
Hopefully GIT_SSH_COMMAND environment variable did the job:
export GIT_SSH_COMMAND=""ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1""

But git clone still didn't start to work.. Now it throws the (on topic):
Permission denied (publickey).

I got already SSH keys and didn't want to regenerate them. I checked plain SSH connection to the host and it was ok:
****    Welcome to Gerrit Code Review    ****

  Hi XXXXX, you have successfully connected over SSH.

  Unfortunately, interactive shells are disabled.
  To clone a hosted Git repository, use:

  git clone ssh://xxxxx@xx.xx.xx:xxx/REPOSITORY_NAME.git

I was confused a bit. I started again and turned on the debug for SSH via -vvv option. And I saw the following:
debug1: read_passphrase: can't open /dev/tty: No such device or address

Possibly, it was an overhead for the GIT_SSH_COMMAND env variable - my key was secured with passphrase (and I entered it when I was checking the login to the git repo host).
So, I decided to get rid of the phasphrase then. A simple command helped me:
ssh-keygen -p

Then I entered my passphrase for the ""old passphrase"" and just hit ENTER twice on the ""new passphare"" to leave it empty i.e. with no passphrase at all and to confirm my choice.
After that I got the freshly cloned repo on my local disk.

Fixed with using HTTP instead. Since I don't want set ""SSH keys"" for a test PC.
Change URL to HTTP when clone:
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git

My problem is a little bit different: I have URL set when adding a existing local repo to remote, by using:
git remote add origin ssh://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git

To fix it, reset URL to HTTP:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git

BTW, you may check your URL using command:
git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)

","setting ssh authorized_keys seem to be simple but hides some traps I'm trying to figure
-- SERVER --
in /etc/ssh/sshd_config set  passwordAuthentication yes to let server temporary accept password authentication
-- CLIENT -- 

consider  cygwin as linux emulation and install & run openssh

1.  generate private and public keys (client side)
# ssh-keygen
here pressing just ENTER you get DEFAULT
2 files ""id_rsa"" and ""id_rsa.pub"" in ~/.ssh/ but if you give a name_for_the_key the generated files are saved in your pwd 
2. place the your_key.pub to target machine ssh-copy-id user_name@host_name
if  you didn't create default key this is the first step to go wrong 
... you should use
ssh-copy-id -i path/to/key_name.pub user_name@host_name
3. logging ssh user_name@host_name will  work only for default id_rsa so here is 2nd trap for you need to ssh -i path/to/key_name user@host
(use ssh -v ... option to see what is happening)
If server still asks for password then  you gave smth.  to Enter passphrase: when you've  created keys ( so it's normal)  
if ssh is not listening default port 22 must use ssh -p port_nr 
-- SERVER -----
4.  modify  /etc/ssh/sshd_config to have
RSAAuthentication yes
PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile  %h/.ssh/authorized_keys

(uncoment if case)
This tells ssh to accept authorized_keys and look in user home directory for key_name sting written  in .ssh/authorized_keys file
5  set permissions in target machine
chmod 755 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Also turn off pass auth 
passwordAuthentication no 
to close the gate to all ssh root/admin/....@your_domain  attempts
6 ensure ownership and group ownership of all non-root home directories are appropriate.
chown -R ~ usernamehere
chgrp -R ~/.ssh/ user

","Another tip to remember. Since v7.0 OpenSSH disables DSS/DSA ssh keys by default due to their inherit weakness. So if you have OpenSSH v7.0+, make sure your key is not ssh-dss.

If you are stuck with DSA keys, you can re-enable support locally by
  updating your sshd_config and ~/.ssh/config files with lines like so: PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-dss

","I have the home directory in a non-standard location and in sshd logs I have this line:
Could not open authorized keys '/data/home/user1/.ssh/authorized_keys': Permission denied

even if all permissions were just fine (see the other answers).
I have found a solution here: http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=25813191&sid=0876f069ec2aa5fdcd691a2e2e7242c2#p25813191
In my particular case:

added a new line in /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts.homedirs:

this is the original line for regular home directories:
/home/[^/]*/\.ssh(/.*)? unconfined_u:object_r:ssh_home_t:s0
this is my new line:
/data/home/[^/]*/\.ssh(/.*)? unconfined_u:object_r:ssh_home_t:s0

followed by a restorecon -r /data/ and a sshd restart

In my case, turned out that the /root directory itself (not e.g. /root/.ssh) had the wrong permissions.  I needed:
chown root.root /root
chmod 700 /root

Of course, those permissions should be something like that (maybe chmod 770) regardless.  However, it specifically prevented sshd from working, even though /root/.ssh and /root/.ssh/authorized_keys both had correct permissions and owners.

","I had this problem when I added the group of the login user to another user.
Let's say there is an ssh-login user called userA and a non-ssh-login user userB. userA has the group userA as well. I modified userB to have the group userA as well. The lead to the the described behaviour, so that userA was not able to login without a prompt.
After I removed the group userA from userB, the login without prompt worked again.

origin  ssh://git@github.com/yourGithubUserName/yourRepo.git (push)

vi .git/config

","Adding public key is the solution.For generating ssh keys: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys  has step by step instructions.
However, the problem can persist if key is not generated in the correct way.
I found this to be a useful link too: https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey
In my case the problem was that I was generating the ssh-key without using sudo but when using git commands I needed to use sudo.
This comment in the above link ""If you generate SSH keys without sudo, then when you try to use a command like sudo git push, you won't be using the SSH key you generated."" helped me.
So, the solution was that I had to use sudo with both key generating commands and git commands.
Or for others, when they don't need sudo anywhere, do not use it in any of the two steps. (key generating and git commands).

","I faced a similar issue when running SSH or Git Clone in Windows. Following findings helps to solve my problem:

When you run “rhc setup” or other ssh methods to generate ssh key, it will create the private key file id_rsa in .ssh folder in your home folder, default is C:\User\UserID
Git for windows has its own .ssh folder in its installation directory. When you run git/ssh, it will look for private key file id_rsa in this folder
Solved the problem by copying id_rsa from the home folder .ssh folder to the .ssh folder in the git installation directory

Also, I think there  a way to “tell” git to use the default .ssh folder in home folder but still need to figure out how.

","Given that none of the answers here worked for me, I finally tracked down my issue connecting to Bitbucket (or Github, doesn't matter in this case) with ssh -vT git@bitbucket.org.
In my case, the failure was due to using a DSA key instead of RSA, and apparently my SSH client no longer allows that.

debug1: Skipping ssh-dss key /c/Users/USER/.ssh/id_dsa for not in PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes

The solution was to add this to .ssh/config:
Host *
    PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-dss

This elegantly appends the ssh-dss key type to all existing accepted public key types and after this was done, git can now ssh into Bitbucket no problem.

","The process of using SCP to copy files from a local machine to an AWS EC2 Linux instance is covered step-by-step (including the points mentioned below) in this video.
To correct this particular issue with using SCP:

You need to specify the correct Linux user. From Amazon:

For Amazon Linux, the user name is ec2-user. 
For RHEL, the user name is ec2-user or root. 
For Ubuntu, the user name is ubuntu or root. 
For Centos, the user name is centos. 
For Fedora, the user name is ec2-user. 
For SUSE, the user name is ec2-user or root. 
Otherwise, if ec2-user and root don't work, check with your AMI provider. 

Your private key must not be publicly visible. Run the following command so that only the root user can read the file.
chmod 400 /path/to/yourKeyFile.pem

scp -i /path/to/whatever.pem /users/me/path-to-file ec2-user@ec2-55-55-555-555.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~

Few notes for beginning:

Note the spaces between the three parameters given after the -i
scp stands for secure copy protocol. Knowing the words makes it easier to remember the command.
-i dictates that you need to give the .pem file as the next param. If there is no -i, than you do not need a .pem.

Change

","You may want to double check the authorized_keys file permissions:

","You have to upload your public key to Heroku:
heroku keys:add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

If you don't have a public key, Heroku will prompt you to add one automatically which works seamlessly. Just use: 
heroku keys:add

To clear all your previous keys do :
heroku keys:clear

To display all your existing keys do :
heroku keys

EDIT:
The above did not seem to work for me. I had messed around with the HOME environment variable and so SSH was searching for keys in the wrong directory.
To ensure that SSH checks for the key in the correct directory do :
ssh -vT git@heroku.com

From the above you could observe that ssh looks for the keys in the /c/Wrong/Directory/.ssh directory which is not where we have the public keys that we just added to heroku ( using heroku keys:add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ) ( Please note that in windows OS ~ refers to the HOME path which in win 7 / 8 is C:\Users\UserName )
To view your current home directory do : echo $HOME or echo %HOME% ( Windows )
To set your HOME directory correctly ( by correctly I mean the parent directory of .ssh directory, so that ssh could look for keys in the correct directory ) refer these links :

","The above given answer DOES work, but found out I needed to do some extra steps before it worked.

I removed all id_rsa* files and generated a new SSH using this guide.
Then, I destroyed the heroku app. Removed the ~/.heroku/credentials file.
'heroku create' command (and since the credentials file is removed, it will prompt you for your email/password.
FINALLY type 'heroku keys:add' and it will upload the default ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file.
It works! Well.... YMMV but I really do hope this can be some help as I struggled the whole day trying to figure this out! Haha

if asks any passphrase don't use blank, fill with a passphrase,but not forget it.
After generating the key you need to add it, like so
$ ssh-add

and it to heroku
->heroku keys:add ""id_rsa.pub""

change directory to workspace, than
->git clone git@heroku.com:stark-dawn-1234.git -o heroku

I use Windows 7 64-Bit + Git-1.7.7.1-preview20111027 and the solution was to copy my keys from C:\users\user\.ssh to C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\.ssh. That's where this git client looks for the keys when pushing to heroku.

","Instead of dealing with SSH keys, you can also try Heroku's new  beta HTTP Git support. It just uses your API token and runs on port 443, so no SSH keys or port 22 to mess with.
To use HTTP Git, first make sure Toolbelt is updated and that your credentials are current:
$ heroku update
$ heroku login

(this is important because Heroku HTTP Git authenticates in a slightly different way than the rest of Toolbelt)
During the beta, you get HTTP by passing the --http-git flag to the relevant heroku apps:create, heroku git:clone and heroku git:remote commands. To create a new app and have it be configured with a HTTP Git remote, run this:
$ heroku apps:create --http-git

To change an existing app from SSH to HTTP Git, simply run this command from the app’s directory on your machine:
$ heroku git:remote --http-git
Git remote heroku updated

Check out the Dev Center documentation for details on how set up HTTP Git for Heroku.

.cer - certificate stored in the X.509 standard format. This certificate contains information about the certificate's owner... along with public and private keys.
.pvk - files are used to store private keys for code signing. You can also create a certificate based on .pvk private key file.
.pfx - stands for personal exchange format. It is used to exchange public and private objects in a single file.  A pfx file can be created from .cer file.  Can also be used to create a Software Publisher Certificate.

","Windows uses .cer extension for an X.509 certificate. These can be in ""binary"" (ASN.1 DER), or it can be encoded with Base-64 and have a header and footer applied (PEM); Windows will recognize either. To verify the integrity of a certificate, you have to check its signature using the issuer's public key... which is, in turn, another certificate.
Windows uses .pfx for a PKCS #12 file. This file can contain a variety of cryptographic information, including certificates, certificate chains, root authority certificates, and private keys. Its contents can be cryptographically protected (with passwords) to keep private keys private and preserve the integrity of root certificates.
Windows uses .pvk for a private key file. I'm not sure what standard (if any) Windows follows for these. Hopefully they are PKCS #8 encoded keys. Emmanuel Bourg reports that these are a proprietary format. Some documentation is available.
You should never disclose your private key. These are contained in .pfx and .pvk files. 
Generally, you only exchange your certificate (.cer) and the certificates of any intermediate issuers (i.e., the certificates of all of your CAs, except the root CA) with other parties.

","In Windows platform, these file types are used for certificate information. Normally used for SSL certificate and Public Key Infrastructure (X.509).

CER files:
CER file is used to store X.509 certificate. Normally used for SSL certification to verify and identify web servers security. The file contains information about certificate owner and public key. A CER file can be in binary (ASN.1 DER) or encoded with Base-64 with header and footer included (PEM), Windows will recognize either of these layout.
PVK files:
Stands for Private Key. Windows uses PVK files to store private keys for code signing in various Microsoft products. PVK is proprietary format.
PFX files
Personal Exchange Format, is a PKCS12 file. This contains a variety of cryptographic information, such as certificates, root authority certificates, certificate chains and private keys. It’s cryptographically protected with passwords to keep private keys private and preserve the integrity of the root certificates. The PFX file is also used in various Microsoft products, such as IIS.

","Here are my personal, super-condensed notes, as far as this subject pertains to me currently, for anyone who's interested:

Both PKCS12 and PEM can store entire cert chains: public keys, private keys, and root (CA) certs.
.pfx == .p12 == ""PKCS12""


fully encrypted

.pem == .cer == .cert == ""PEM""


base-64 (string) encoded X509 cert (binary) with a header and footer


base-64 is basically just a string of ""A-Za-z0-9+/"" used to represent 0-63, 6 bits of binary at a time, in sequence, sometimes with 1 or 2 ""="" characters at the very end when there are leftovers (""="" being ""filler/junk/ignore/throw away"" characters)
the header and footer is something like ""-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----"" and ""-----END CERTIFICATE-----"" or ""-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----"" and ""-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----""

Windows recognizes .cer and .cert as cert files

.jks == ""Java Key Store""


just a Java-specific file format which the API uses


.p12 and .pfx files can also be used with the JKS API


""Trust Stores"" contain public, trusted, root (CA) certs, whereas
""Identity/Key Stores"" contain private, identity certs; file-wise,

","As Roland mentioned in their answer, it's a warning that the ssh-agent doesn't understand the format of the public key and even then, the public key will not be used locally.
However, I can also elaborate and answer why the warning is there. It simply boils down to the fact that the PuTTY Key Generator generates two different public key formats depending on what you do in the program.
Note: Throughout my explanation, the key files I will be using/generating will be named id_rsa with their appropriate extensions. Furthermore, for copy-paste convenience, the parent folder of the keys will be assumed to be ~/.ssh/. Adjust these details to suit your needs as desired.
The Formats
Link to the relevant PuTTY documentation
SSH-2
When you save a key using the PuTTY Key Generator using the ""Save public key"" button, it will be saved in the format defined by RFC 4716.
Example:
---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----
Comment: ""github-example-key""
AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEAhl/CNy9wI1GVdiHAJQV0CkHnMEqW7+Si9WYF

tBjh7cOyuU/c4M4D6o2mAVYdLAWMBkSoLG8Oel6TCcfpO/nElw==
---- END SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----

OpenSSH
Contrary to popular belief, this format doesn't get saved by the generator. However it is generated and shown in the text box titled ""Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file"". To save it as a file, you have to manually copy it from the text box and paste it into a new text file.
For the key shown above, this would be:
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEAhl/CNy9wI1GVdiHAJQV0CkHnMEqW7+Si9WYFi2fSBrsGcmqeb5EwgnhmTcPgtM5ptGBjUZR84nxjZ8SPmnLDiDyHDPIsmwLBHxcppY0fhRSGtWL5fT8DGm9EfXaO1QN8c31VU/IkD8niWA6NmHNE1qEqpph3DznVzIm3oMrongEjGw7sDP48ZTZp2saYVAKEEuGC1YYcQ1g20yESzo7aP70ZeHmQqI9nTyEAip3mL20+qHNsHfW8hJAchaUN8CwNQABJaOozYijiIUgdbtSTMRDYPi7fjhgB3bA9tBjh7cOyuU/c4M4D6o2mAVYdLAWMBkSoLG8Oel6TCcfpO/nElw== github-example-key

The format of the key is simply ssh-rsa <signature> <comment> and can be created by rearranging the SSH-2 formatted file.
Regenerating Public Keys
If you are making use of ssh-agent, you will likely also have access to ssh-keygen.
If you have your OpenSSH Private Key (id_rsa file), you can generate the OpenSSH Public Key File using:
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -y > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

If you only have the PUTTY Private Key (id_rsa.ppk file), you will need to convert it first.

Open the PuTTY Key Generator
On the menu bar, click ""File"" > ""Load private key""
Select your id_rsa.ppk file
On the menu bar, click ""Conversions"" > ""Export OpenSSH key""
Save the file as id_rsa (without an extension)

Now that you have an OpenSSH Private Key, you can use the ssh-keygen tool as above to perform manipulations on the key.
Bonus: The PKCS#1 PEM-encoded Public Key Format
To be honest, I don't know what this key is used for as I haven't needed it. But I have it in my notes I've collated over the years and I'll include it here for wholesome goodness. The file will look like this:
-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBCAKCAQEAhl/CNy9wI1GVdiHAJQV0CkHnMEqW7+Si9WYFi2fSBrsGcmqeb5Ew

6o2mAVYdLAWMBkSoLG8Oel6TCcfpO/nElwIBJQ==
-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----

This file can be generated using an OpenSSH Private Key (as generated in ""Regenerating Public Keys"" above) using:
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -y -e -m pem > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pem

Alternatively, you can use an OpenSSH Public Key using:
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -e -m pem > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pem

","Full details in this answer. 
In summary, when ssh-add -l returns The agent has no identities it means that keys used by ssh (stored in files such as ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa, etc) are either missing, they are not known to the authentication agent (ssh-agent), or their permissions are set incorrectly (e.g., world writable).
If your keys are missing (i.e., you have not generated any keys), use 'ssh-keygen' (e.g., ssh-keygen -t rsa) to generate them, then use ssh-add to add them.
If keys exist but are not known to ssh-agent (e.g., they may be in a non-standard folder) use 'ssh-add' (e.g., ssh-add /path/to/my-ssh-folder/id_rsa) to add them.
See this answer if you are having trouble with ssh-add or ssh-agent.

","I have been stucked a while on the same problem, which I eventually resolved.
My problem: I could not execute any push. I could check & see my remote (using git remote -v), but when I executed git push origin master, it returned : Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository. and so.
How I solved it :

I generated a key using ssh-keygen -t rsa. Entering a name for the key file (when asked) was useless.
I could then add the key (to git): ssh-add /Users/federico/.ssh/id_rsa , which successfully returned Identity added: /Users/myname/.ssh/id_rsa (/Users/myname/.ssh/id_rsa)
I added the SSH key to github using this help page. 
Having tried all the commands in Github's 'Permission denied publickey' help page, only the ssh-add -l command worked / seemed useful (after having ran the previous steps), it successfully returned my key. The last step shows you where to check your public key on your GitHub page. And this command will help you check all your keys : ls -al ~/.ssh.

Then the push command eventually worked !
I hope this will help !
Best luck to all.

","THE 2019 ANSWER for macOS Sierra & High Sierra & Catalina: 
PS: most of the other answers will have you to create a new ssh key ... but you don't need to do that :) 
As described in detail on https://openradar.appspot.com/27348363, macOS/OS X till Yosemite used to remember SSH keys added by command ssh-add -K <key>
So here are the 4 steps i had to take in order for it to work: 
1: ssh-add ~/.ssh/PATH_TO_YOUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY (e.g. ~/.ssh/id_rsa)
2: Add the following in ~/.ssh/config
Host * 
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile PATH_TO_YOUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY (e.g. ~/.ssh/id_rsa)

3: make sure to remove any gitconfig entry that use osxkeychain helper:

4: restart your terminal for it to take effect.

","first of all you need to go in your ssh directory
for this type following command in your terminal in mac or whatever you use in window    
cd ~/.ssh

now it is in the ssh
here you can find all you ssh key/files related to your all projects. now, type the following command to show you if any ssh key available    
ls

this will show you all available ssh, in my case there were two
now, you will need to start an agent to add a ssh in it. For this type following command    
eval ""$(ssh-agent -s)""

now last but not least you will add a ssh in this agent type following command    
ssh-add ~/.ssh/your-ssh

","One additional element that I realized is that typically .ssh folder is created in your root folder in Mac OS X /Users/. If you try to use ssh -vT git@github.com from another folder it will give you an error even if you had added the correct key.

","Steps for BitBucket:
if you dont want to generate new key, SKIP ssh-keygen
ssh-keygen -t rsa 

Copy the public key to clipboard:
clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Login to Bit Bucket:
Go to View Profile -> Settings -> SSH Keys (In Security tab)
Click Add Key, 
Paste the key in the box, add a descriptive title
Go back to Git Bash :
ssh-add -l

You should get :

","I had this issue after restoring a hard drive from a backup. 
My problem: 
I could check & see my remote (using git remote -v), but when I executed git push origin master, it returned : Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository. 
I already had an SSH folder and SSH keys, and adding them via Terminal (ssh-add /path/to/my-ssh-folder/id_rsa) successfully added my identity, but I still couldn't push and still got the same error.  Generating a new key was a bad idea for me, because it was tied to other very secure permissions on AWS.
It turned out the link between the key and my Github profile had broken.
Solution: 
Re-adding the key to Github in Profile > Settings > SSH and GPG keys resolved the issue. 
Also:
My account had 2-factor authentication set up. When this is the case, if Terminal requests credentials, use your username - but NOT your Github password.  For 2-factor authentication, you need to use your authentication code (for me, this was generated by Authy on my phone, and I had to copy it into Terminal for the pw).

","I just thought I'd share that I found the answer to my own question.
Writing out my problem made it even more clear to me, and I further investigated into where I thought my problem lay: the ssh key
Turns out I was right. The issue wasn't with the key itself, but rather that I had not added it to my local Mac's list of known ssh keys. So even though my Heroku account had the correct key uploaded, my Mac could not authenticate with it because it could not find that key on my computer. The solution?
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
#and, to confirm it's been added to the known list of keys
ssh-add -l

","I know this has already been answered. But I would like to add my solution as it may helpful for others in the future..
A common key error is: Permission denied (publickey). You can fix this by using keys:add to notify Heroku of your new key.
In short follow these steps: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/keys
First you have to create a key if you don't have one:
ssh-keygen -t rsa

Second you have to add the key to Heroku:
heroku keys:add

","I had the exact same error (on windows 7) and the cause was different.  I solved it in a different way so I thought I'd add the cause and solution here for others.  
Even though the error seemed to point to heroku really the error was saying ""Heroku can't get to the git repository"".  I swore I had the same keys on all the servers because I created it and uploaded it to one after the other at the same time.  
After spending almost a day on this I realized that because git was only showing me the fingerprint and not the actual key. I couldn't verify that it's key matched the one on my HD or heroku.  I looked in the known hosts file and guess what... it shows the keys for each server and I was able to clearly see that the git and heroku public keys did not match.
1) I deleted all the files in my key folder, the key from github using their website, and the key from heroku using git bash and the command heroku keys:clear
2) Followed github's instructions here to generate a new key pair and upload the public key to git
3) using git bash- heroku keys:add
to upload the same key to heroku.  
Now git push heroku master works.
what a nightmare, hope this helped somebody.

","The problem I was having is that I was only using https for my GitHub account. I needed to make sure that my GitHub account was setup for ssh access and that GitHub and heroku were both using the same public keys. These are the steps I took:

Navigate to the ~/.ssh directory and delete the id_rsa and id_rsa.pub if they are there. I started with new keys, though it might not be necessary.
$ cd ~/.ssh
$ rm id_rsa id_rsa.pub

Follow the steps on gitHub to generate ssh keys
Login to heroku, create a new site and add your public keys:
$ heroku login
...
$ heroku create
$ heroku keys:add
$ git push heroku master

","Had a similar issue, and tried lots of things.  Ultimately what worked for me, was to have Gnu on Windows installed (https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow/releases) , and ensure that it was using the ssh tool inside that directory and not the one with Git. Once installed test with (ensure if its in your environment PATH that it preceds Git\bin)
C:\Git\htest2>which ssh
C:\Program Files (x86)\Gow\bin\ssh.BAT

I used putty and pageant as described here:http://rubyonrailswin.wordpress.com/2010/03/08/getting-git-to-work-on-heroku-on-windows-using-putty-plink-pageant/

","i had the same case on linux ubuntu and just fixed it, it seems that OS was confused between the /root/.ssh/ and home/user/.ssh/ dir, what i did was:

removed all keys from root and home/user .shh directory.
generated a new key make sure to pay attention to the path of creation (/home/you/.ssh/id_rsa) or (/root/.ssh/id_rsa)
check heroku keys heroku keys
if keys in there clear heroku keys:clear
heroku keys:add now in here if heroku couldn't find a key and asked to generate one right no, and this mean you have the same issue as mine, do the add command like this heroku keys:add /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub the path that you'll add will be the one that you got in step 2.

","If you have SSH installed, you should be able to run..
ssh-keygen

Then go through the steps, you'll have two files, id_rsa and id_rsa.pub (the first is your private key, the second is your public key - the one you copy to remote machines)
Then, connect to the remote machine you want to login to, to the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys add the contents of your that id_rsa.pub file.
Oh, and chmod 600 all the id_rsa* files (both locally and remote), so no other users can read them:
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa*

Similarly, ensure the remote ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file is chmod 600 also:
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Then, when you do ssh remote.machine, it should ask you for the key's password, not the remote machine.

To make it nicer to use, you can use ssh-agent to hold the decrypted keys in memory - this means you don't have to type your keypair's password every single time. To launch the agent, you run (including the back-tick quotes, which eval the output of the ssh-agent command)
`ssh-agent`

On some distros, ssh-agent is started automatically. If you run echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK and it shows a path (probably in /tmp/) it's already setup, so you can skip the previous command.
Then to add your key, you do
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

and enter your passphrase. It's stored until you remove it (using the ssh-add -D command, which removes all keys from the agent)

"3116907","RSA: Get exponent and modulus given a public key","I need to encrypt some data using RSA in JavaScript. All of the libraries around ask for an exponent and a modulus, yet I get a single public.key file from my opponent. 
How do you retrieve the public exponent and modulus part from an RSA file?
","It depends on the tools you can use. I doubt there is a JavaScript too that could do it directly within the browser. It also depends if it's a one-off (always the same key) or whether you need to script it.
Command-line / OpenSSL
If you want to use something like OpenSSL on a unix command line, you can do something as follows.
I'm assuming you public.key file contains something like this:
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAmBAjFv+29CaiQqYZIw4P
J0q5Qz2gS7kbGleS3ai8Xbhu5n8PLomldxbRz0RpdCuxqd1yvaicqpDKe/TT09sR

5xVkSp3kxcNcNb/mePSKQIPafQ1sAmBKPwycA/1I5nLzDVuQa95ZWMn0JkphtFIh
HQIDAQAB
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

Then, the commands would be:
PUBKEY=`grep -v -- ----- public.key | tr -d '\n'`

Then, you can look into the ASN.1 structure:
echo $PUBKEY | base64 -d | openssl asn1parse -inform DER -i

This should give you something like this:
    0:d=0  hl=4 l= 290 cons: SEQUENCE          
    4:d=1  hl=2 l=  13 cons:  SEQUENCE          
    6:d=2  hl=2 l=   9 prim:   OBJECT            :rsaEncryption
   17:d=2  hl=2 l=   0 prim:   NULL              
   19:d=1  hl=4 l= 271 prim:  BIT STRING 

The modulus and public exponent are in the last BIT STRING, offset 19, so use -strparse:
 echo $PUBKEY | base64 -d | openssl asn1parse -inform DER -i -strparse 19

This will give you the modulus and the public exponent, in hexadecimal (the two INTEGERs):
    0:d=0  hl=4 l= 266 cons: SEQUENCE          
    4:d=1  hl=4 l= 257 prim:  INTEGER           :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
  265:d=1  hl=2 l=   3 prim:  INTEGER           :010001

That's probably fine if it's always the same key, but this is probably not very convenient to put in a script.
Alternatively (and this might be easier to put into a script),
openssl rsa -pubin -inform PEM -text -noout < public.key

will return this:

It depends on the input format. If it's an X.509 certificate in a keystore, use (RSAPublicKey)cert.getPublicKey(): this object has two getters for the modulus and the exponent.
If it's in the format as above, you might want to use BouncyCastle and its PEMReader to read it. I haven't tried the following code, but this would look more or less like this:
PEMReader pemReader = new PEMReader(new FileReader(""file.pem""));
Object obj = pemReader.readObject();
pemReader.close();
if (obj instanceof X509Certificate) {
   // Just in case your file contains in fact an X.509 certificate,
   // useless otherwise.
   obj = ((X509Certificate)obj).getPublicKey();
}
if (obj instanceof RSAPublicKey) {
   // ... use the getters to get the BigIntegers.
}

(You can use BouncyCastle similarly in C# too.)

","Copying the desired public key would fall squarely into the provisioning phase. The exact answer depends on what provisioning you fancy to use (shell, Chef, Puppet etc). The most trivial would be a file provisioner for the key, something along this:
config.vm.provision ""file"", source: ""~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"", destination: ""~/.ssh/me.pub""

Well, actually you need to append to authorized_keys. Use the the shell provisioner, like so:
config.vm.provision ""shell"", inline: <<-SHELL
  cat /home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys
SHELL
end

You can also use a true provisioner, like Puppet. For example see Managing SSH Authorized Keys with Puppet.

","There's a more ""elegant"" way of accomplishing what you want to do. You can find the existing private key and use it instead of going through the trouble of adding your public key.
Proceed like this to see the path to existing private key (look below for IdentityFile): 
run  vagrant ssh-config 
result:

$ vagrant ssh-config
Host magento2.vagrant150
  HostName 127.0.0.1
  User vagrant
  Port 3150
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  PasswordAuthentication no
  IdentityFile ""/Users/madismanni/m2/vagrant-magento/.vagrant/machines/magento2.vagrant150/virtualbox/private_key""
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  LogLevel FATAL

Then you can use the private key like this, note also the switch for switching off password authentication

ssh -i /Users/madismanni/m2/vagrant-magento/.vagrant/machines/magento2.vagrant150/virtualbox/private_key -o PasswordAuthentication=no vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p 3150

just do:

chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config

then you can just ssh via hostname.
To get list of hostnames configured in ~/.ssh/config
grep -E '^Host ' ~/.ssh/config

$ grep -E '^Host' ~/.ssh/config
Host web
Host db
$ ssh web

","Had the same issue and wasted hours, I'm using centos 7. The following solved my problem.
On linux: 

""cd /home/your_username/.ssh""
View ""id_rsa.pub"" and copy contents
On openshift create a key from the UI and paste the contents from your ""*.pub"" file
Save your new key
Try reconnecting from your local machine

","If you're talking about an X509 certificate:

FileStream fs = new FileStream(""your_cert_file.crt"", FileMode.Open);
byte[] certBytes = new byte[fs.Length];
fs.Read(certBytes, 0, (Int32)fs.Length);
fs.Close();
System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate x509cert = 
    new X509Certificate(certBytes);
Console.WriteLine(x509cert.GetPublicKey());
Console.WriteLine(x509cert.GetPublicKeyString());

EDITED after the comment of @hkproj done in ""7/16/2012 15:04:58 Z"":
Looking around here I found ""Reading PEM RSA Public Key Only using Bouncy Castle"".
I guess what you want is this:

using (StreamReader reader = File.OpenText(@""c:\RSA.txt""))
{
    Org.BouncyCastle.OpenSsl.PemReader pr = 
        new Org.BouncyCastle.OpenSsl.PemReader(reader);
    Org.BouncyCastle.Utilities.IO.Pem.PemObject po = pr.ReadPemObject();

    Console.WriteLine(""PemObject, Type: "" + po.Type);
    Console.WriteLine(""PemObject, Length: "" + po.Content.Length);
}

However, with your file I get an error: System.IO.IOException : base64 data appears to be truncated.
So changing your file to something like:
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

The result is:

","Are you speaking about certificates stored in file?
If you have an object like:
X509Certificate2 certificate;

you can use following code:
RSACryptoServiceProvider rsaprovider =
                    (RSACryptoServiceProvider)certificate.PublicKey.Key;

and then use the class RSACryptoServiceProvider (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.rsacryptoserviceprovider.aspx).
To load an X509Certificate2 use its constructor (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.x509certificates.x509certificate2.aspx).
This program works fine for me:
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        try 
        {
            X509Certificate2 certificate = 
                new X509Certificate2(""<PFX Certificate Path"", ""<Certificate-Password>"");
            RSACryptoServiceProvider rsaprovider = (RSACryptoServiceProvider)certificate.PublicKey.Key;
        }
        catch(Exception e)

Just call the 'RSA' method with the text you want to encrypt and you're done.
","You can create an RSACryptoServiceProvider from a PEM file using the following class (GetRSAProviderFromPemFile method).
Warning:
Don't just copy code from StackOverflow without verification! Especially not crypto code! This code has bugs (see comments). You may want to write and run tests before using this in production (if you really have no better option). I refuse to edit the code to fix it, as it would be just as unreliable as before without tests and an active maintainer.

","I wanted to help explain what's going on here. 
An RSA ""Public Key"" consists of two numbers:

the modulus (e.g. a 2,048 bit number)
the exponent (usually 65,537)

Using your RSA public key as an example, the two numbers are:

Modulus: 297,056,429,939,040,947,991,047,334,197,581,225,628,107,021,573,849,359,042,679,698,093,131,908,015,712,695,688,944,173,317,630,555,849,768,647,118,986,535,684,992,447,654,339,728,777,985,990,170,679,511,111,819,558,063,246,667,855,023,730,127,805,401,069,042,322,764,200,545,883,378,826,983,730,553,730,138,478,384,327,116,513,143,842,816,383,440,639,376,515,039,682,874,046,227,217,032,079,079,790,098,143,158,087,443,017,552,531,393,264,852,461,292,775,129,262,080,851,633,535,934,010,704,122,673,027,067,442,627,059,982,393,297,716,922,243,940,155,855,127,430,302,323,883,824,137,412,883,916,794,359,982,603,439,112,095,116,831,297,809,626,059,569,444,750,808,699,678,211,904,501,083,183,234,323,797,142,810,155,862,553,705,570,600,021,649,944,369,726,123,996,534,870,137,000,784,980,673,984,909,570,977,377,882,585,701
Exponent: 65,537

The question then becomes how do we want to store these numbers in a computer. First we convert both to hexadecimal:

Modulus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
Exponent: 010001

RSA invented the first format
RSA invented a format first:
RSAPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
    modulus           INTEGER,  -- n
    publicExponent    INTEGER   -- e
}

They chose to use the DER flavor of the ASN.1 binary encoding standard to represent the two numbers [1]:
SEQUENCE (2 elements)
   INTEGER (2048 bit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
   INTEGER (24 bit): 010001

The final binary encoding in ASN.1 is:
30 82 01 0A      ;sequence (0x10A bytes long)
   02 82 01 01   ;integer (0x101 bytes long)
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
   02 03         ;integer (3 bytes long)
      010001

If you then run all those bytes together and Base64 encode it, you get:
MIIBCgKCAQEA61BjmfXGEvWmegnBGSuS+rU9soUg2FnODva32D1AqhwdziwHINFa

RSA labs then said add a header and trailer:

-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----

Five hyphens, and the words BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY. That is your PEM DER ASN.1 PKCS#1 RSA Public key

PEM: synonym for base64
DER: a flavor of ASN.1 encoding
ASN.1: the binary encoding scheme used
PKCS#1: The formal specification that dictates representing a public key as structure that consists of modulus followed by an exponent 
RSA public key: the public key algorithm being used

Not just RSA
After that, other forms of public key cryptography came along:

Diffie-Hellman
Ellicptic Curve

When it came time to create a standard for how to represent the parameters of those encryption algorithms, people adopted a lot of the same ideas that RSA originally defined:

use ASN.1 binary encoding
base64 it
wrap it with five hyphens
and the words BEGIN PUBLIC KEY

But rather than using:

-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
-----BEGIN DH PUBLIC KEY-----
-----BEGIN EC PUBLIC KEY-----

They decided instead to include the Object Identifier (OID) of what is to follow. In the case of an RSA public key, that is:

RSA PKCS#1: 1.2.840.113549.1.1.1

So for RSA public key it was essentially:
public struct RSAPublicKey {
   INTEGER modulus,
   INTEGER publicExponent 
}

Now they created SubjectPublicKeyInfo which is basically:
public struct SubjectPublicKeyInfo {
   AlgorithmIdentifier algorithm,
   RSAPublicKey subjectPublicKey
}

In actual DER ASN.1 definition is:
SubjectPublicKeyInfo  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
    algorithm  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
        algorithm               OBJECT IDENTIFIER, -- 1.2.840.113549.1.1.1 rsaEncryption (PKCS#1 1)
        parameters              ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL  },
    subjectPublicKey     BIT STRING {
        RSAPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
            modulus            INTEGER,    -- n
            publicExponent     INTEGER     -- e
        }
}

That gives you an ASN.1 of:
SEQUENCE (2 elements)
   SEQUENCE (2 elements)
      OBJECT IDENTIFIER 1.2.840.113549.1.1.1
      NULL
   BIT STRING (1 element)
      SEQUENCE (2 elements)
         INTEGER (2048 bit): 0282010100EB506399F5C612F5A67A09C1192B92FAB53DB28520D859CE0EF6B7D83D40AA1C1DCE2C0720D15A0F531595CAD81BA5D129F91CC6769719F1435872C4BCD0521150A0263B470066489B918BFCA03CE8A0E9FC2C0314C4B096EA30717C03C28CA29E678E63D78ACA1E9A63BDB1261EE7A0B041AB53746D68B57B68BEF37B71382838C95DA8557841A3CA58109F0B4F77A5E929B1A25DC2D6814C55DC0F81CD2F4E5DB95EE70C706FC02C4FCA358EA9A82D8043A47611195580F89458E3DAB5592DEFE06CDE1E516A6C61ED78C13977AE9660A9192CA75CD72967FD3AFAFA1F1A2FF6325A5064D847028F1E6B2329E8572F36E708A549DDA355FC74A32FDD8DBA65
         INTEGER (24 bit): 010001

The final binary encoding in ASN.1 is:

And as before, you take all those bytes, Base64 encode them, you end up with your  second example:
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA61BjmfXGEvWmegnBGSuS

Add the slightly different header and trailer, and you get:
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

And this is your X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo/OpenSSL PEM public key [2].
Do it right, or hack it
Now that you know that the encoding isn't magic, you can write all the pieces needed to parse out the RSA modulus and exponent. Or you can recognize that the first 24 bytes are just added new stuff on top of the original PKCS#1 standard
30 82 01 22          ;SEQUENCE (0x122 bytes = 290 bytes)
|  30 0D             ;SEQUENCE (0x0d bytes = 13 bytes) 
|  |  06 09          ;OBJECT IDENTIFIER (0x09 = 9 bytes)

|  03 82 01 0F 00    ;BIT STRING  (0x10f = 271 bytes)
|  |  ...

And due to an extraordinary coincidence of fortune and good luck:

24 bytes happens to correspond exactly to 32 base64 encoded characters

That means if you take your second X.509 public key, and separate the first 32 characters:
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

Summary: the keys internally are the same, they just look different. An earlier comment pointed out the RSA key format was defined in PKCS#1, and the plain old 'public key' format was defined in PKCS#8. However, editing one form doesn't turn it into the other. Hopefully I've now beaten this distinction to death.
In case there's still a spark of life left, though, let's flog this a bit more and reference the certificate that was originally generated with the RSA private key so long ago, examining its public key and modulus:
>openssl x509 -in newclient_cert.pem -pubkey -noout -modulus

...and they all lived happily ever after: the certificate has the same modulus value as the RSA public key, RSA private key, and plain old 'public key'. The certificate contains the same plain old 'public key' value that we saw earlier, although it was signed with a file marked as an RSA private key. It's safe to say there's a consensus.
There's no 'RSAPublicKey_out' equivalent keyword in the X509 quadrant of the OpenSSL galaxy, so we can't try that, although the modulus value is described as the ""RSA key modulus"" which I suppose is as close as we'll get. 
How this would all look with a DSA-signed certificate, I don't know.
I realize this doesn't answer the original question, but perhaps it provides some useful background. If not, my apologies. At the very least, things not to do and assumptions not to make.
No doubt one has noted the slightly irritating repetition of ""writing RSA key"", when it's not doing any such thing. I assume what's meant is that the rsa module recognizes the plain old public key as a true RSA key, and that's why it keeps harping on ""RSA key"" (plus it is the rsa module, after all). If I recall properly, the generic EVP_PKEY structure has a union for all the key types, with each key type having its own special set of values (the helpfully named g, w, q, and other consonants).
In conclusion, I note there was a complaint regarding programming & development; now, every OpenSSL command obviously has corresponding code, and if one wishes to explore all the wonders that is OpenSSL programming today, the command line would seem a reasonable place to start. In this particular case (as I'm using a recent cygwin at the moment) one might start by reviewing \openssl-1.0.2f\apps\rsa.c and (given one has a high tolerance for macros) \openssl-1.0.2f\crypto\pem\pem_all.c

My understanding was that public keys encrypt, private keys decrypt... can anyone help me understand? 
","Your understanding of ""public keys encrypt, private keys decrypt"" is correct...  for data/message ENCRYPTION.  For digital signatures, it is the reverse.  With a digital signature, you are trying to prove that the document signed by you came from you.  To do that, you need to use something that only YOU have:  your private key.
A digital signature in its simplest description is a hash (SHA1, MD5, etc.) of the data (file, message, etc.) that is subsequently encrypted with the signer's private key.  Since that is something only the signer has (or should have) that is where the trust comes from.  EVERYONE has (or should have) access to the signer's public key.   
So, to validate a digital signature, the recipient 

Calculates a hash of the same data (file, message, etc.),
Decrypts the digital signature using the sender's PUBLIC key, and 
Compares the 2 hash values.    

If they match, the signature is considered valid.  If they don't match, it either means that a different key was used to sign it, or that the data has been altered (either intentionally or unintentionally).
Hope that helps!

My understanding was that public keys encrypt, private keys decrypt... can anyone help me understand? 
","Thought I'd provide a supplemental explanation for anyone looking for something more intuitively revealing.
A big part of this confusion arises from naming 'public keys' and 'private keys' as such because how these things actually work is directly at odds with how a 'key' is understood to be.
Take encryption for example. It could be thought of as working like so:

The parties that want to be able to read the secret messages each keep a key
hidden (i.e. a private key)
The parties that want to be able to send secret messages all have the ability to obtain an unlocked locked (i.e. a public lock)
Then sending a secret message is as easy as locking it with an unlocked lock, but unlocking it afterwards can only be done with one of the hidden keys.

This allows secret messages to be sent between parties, but from an intuitive standpoint here, 'public lock' is a more suitable name than 'public key'.
However, for sending digital signatures the roles are somewhat reversed:

The party that wants to sign messages is the only one with access to the unlocked locks (i.e. a private lock)
The parties that want to verify the signature all have the ability to obtain a key (i.e. a public key)
Then what the signer does is create two identical messages: the one that anyone can read and one to accompany it, but which they lock with one of their private locks.
Then when the receiver gets the message, they can read it, and then use the public key to unlock the locked message and compare the two messages. If the messages are the same, then they know that:

The unlocked message wasn't tampered with during travel and,
The message must have been from the person who has the matching lock to their public key.

And finally, this entire system only works if anyone who wants to validate a signer's signature has an authoritative place to go to to get the matching key to the signer's locks. Otherwise, anyone can say ""Hey, here's the key to so-and-so's private lock"", send you a message pretending to be them but lock it with their private lock, you perform all the above steps and believe the message must actually be from the person you thought, but you're fooled because you were mislead as to the true owner of a public key.

So long as there's a trust-worthy source for retrieving a signer's public key, you'll know who the rightful owner of a public key is, and will be able to validate their signature.

","The public key encrypts and only the private key can decrypt it, and the reverse is true. They both encrypt to different hashes but each key can decrypt the other's encryption. 
There are a few different ways to verify that a message came from some expected sender. For example:
The sender sends:

The message
The hash of the message encrypted with their private key

The receiver:

Decrypts the signature (2) with the public key to obtain a message, supposedly the same message as (1) but we don't know yet. We now have two messages that we need to verify are identical. So to do this, we will encrypt them both with our public key and compare the two hashes. So we will ....
Encrypt the original message (1) with the public key to obtain a hash
Encrypt the decrypted message (3) to get a second hash and compare to (4) to verify that they are identical. 

If they aren't identical it means either the message was tampered with or it was signed with some other key and not the one we thought...
Another example would be for the sender to use a common hash that the receiver might know to use as well. For example:
The sender sends:

A message 
Takes a known hash of the message, then encrypts the hash with the private key

The receiver:

Decrypts (2) and gets a hash value
Hashes the message (1) with the same hash used by the sender
Compares the two hashes to make sure they match

This again ensures the message wasn't tampered with and it is from the expected sender.

The security-specification says that the public-certificate has to be X.509 standard. Doesn't X.509 rely on the private / public key method? Because I only get one .pem file, containing a private key, and a certificate, but no public key, using the following command:
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out ./cert.pem -keyout ./cert.pem

Do I have to modify the command in order to create a private and a public key?
","The basics command line steps to generate a private and public key using OpenSSL are as follow
openssl genrsa -out private.key 1024
openssl req -new -x509 -key private.key -out publickey.cer -days 365
openssl pkcs12 -export -out public_privatekey.pfx -inkey private.key -in publickey.cer

Step 1 – generates a private key
Step 2 – creates a X509 certificate (.cer file) containing your public key which you upload when registering your private application (or upgrading to a partner application).
Step 3 – Export your x509 certificate and private key to a pfx file. If your chosen wrapper library uses the .pem file to sign requests then this step is not required.
Hope that helps! This answer explains the different file extensions.

They keys are different, even in length. Why?
","If it's just the public key string that you want, it's easier to get the publickey.cert file, as it is a plain text file. Assuming that you have the full path of the file (like ""/home/users/iprogrammer/publickey.cert"" or ""D:\MyDocuments\publickey.cert"" )  you do something like:
public String getPublicKeyString( Path path ) throws IOException {
    byte[] fileBytes = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(path));
    return new String( fileBytes, ""US-ASCII"" );
}

This will give you the whole file, including the -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----END CERTIFICATE-----.
Once you have the whole file, you can use the BouncyCastle library to open it:
    PEMParser pemParser = new PEMParser(new StringReader(certPEMData));
    Object parsedObj = pemParser.readObject();
    System.out.println(""PemParser returned: "" + parsedObj);
    if (parsedObj instanceof X509CertificateHolder)
    {
        X509CertificateHolder x509CertificateHolder = (X509CertificateHolder) parsedObj;
        return x509CertificateHolder.getSubjectPublicKeyInfo().getPublicKeyData().getString();
    }
    else
    {
        throw new RuntimeException(""The parsed object was not an X509CertificateHolder."");

"4192296","C# How to simply encrypt a text file with a PGP Public Key?","I've researched a bit about how to achieve what I said in the question and found several APIs but most of them look very complicated and since I'm just a noobie in this area I just want a simple method like:
public String Encrypt(String message, PublicKey publicKey)

Don't know if this can be done? If not then please someone enlighten me another way to achieve this :)
Thank you.
UPDATE:
So far I have only seen that all of the library for OpenPGP encryption require both the public key and private key to do the encrypt while I only want to encrypt with the public key (because I don't have the private key to use it)!

Notes about the final goal:
The TCP connection is already protected by SSL. The main purpose of this layer of protection is defending against intentional or unintentional webserver logging, crash dumps, etc.
On the PHP side, a temporary private key will be generated (it will expire after a short time). The caller (in Javascript) is responsible for asking for a new public key when it expires. The reason for private key expiration is to prevent logged encrypted data decryption, in case the server which stores the private key is later compromised.
Servers compromised scenario: someone gets his hands on backups for all machines except the database server (and cannot access the database due to firewalling, even if he finds out the user and password). Since the private key which encrypted the logged data no longer exists, there is nothing the attacker can do.
","Check out node-rsa.
It's a node.js module

This module provides access to RSA public-key routines from OpenSSL.
  Support is limited to RSAES-OAEP and encryption with a public key, decryption with a private key.

Maybe you can port it to run in the browser.

RSA client side library for javascript: (pidcrypt has been officially discontinued and the website domain is expired - see @jack's answer which contains the same libraries as pidcrypt contained).

Servers compromised scenario: someone gets his hands on backups for all machines except the database server (and cannot access the database due to firewalling, even if he finds out the user and password). Since the private key which encrypted the logged data no longer exists, there is nothing the attacker can do.
","I've used something similar for my login page; it encrypts login credentials using the given public key information (N, e) which can be decrypted in PHP.
It uses the following files that are part of JSBN:

jsbn.js - to work with big integers
rsa.js - for RSA encryption only (uses jsbn.js)
rng.js - basic entropy collector
prng4.js - ARC4 RNG backend

To encrypt data:
$pk = '-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----';
$kh = openssl_pkey_get_private($pk);
$details = openssl_pkey_get_details($kh);

function to_hex($data)
{
    return strtoupper(bin2hex($data));
}

?>
<script>
var rsa = new RSAKey();
rsa.setPublic('<?php echo to_hex($details['rsa']['n']) ?>', '<?php echo to_hex($details['rsa']['e']) ?>');

// encrypt using RSA
var data = rsa.encrypt('hello world');
</script>

This is how you would decode the sent data:
$kh = openssl_pkey_get_private($pk);
$details = openssl_pkey_get_details($kh);
// convert data from hexadecimal notation
$data = pack('H*', $data);
if (openssl_private_decrypt($data, $r, $kh)) {
   echo $r;
}

"12457234","Encrypt in Javascript, decrypt in PHP, using public-key cryptography","I'd like to encrypt in JavaScript, decrypt in PHP, using public-key cryptography. I've been trying to find libraries that can accomplish this, but am having issues.
I am currently looking at openpgpjs, but I need support in all browsers, and even the test page has errrors on the only listed as supported browser (Google Chrome).
Notes about the final goal:
The TCP connection is already protected by SSL. The main purpose of this layer of protection is defending against intentional or unintentional webserver logging, crash dumps, etc.
On the PHP side, a temporary private key will be generated (it will expire after a short time). The caller (in Javascript) is responsible for asking for a new public key when it expires. The reason for private key expiration is to prevent logged encrypted data decryption, in case the server which stores the private key is later compromised.

Since the private key which encrypted the logged data no longer exists, there is nothing the attacker can do.
","Be careful with implementing RSA. In fact, you probably shouldn't use RSA at all. (Use libsodium instead!)
Even if you're using a library (e.g. PHP's OpenSSL extension directly or, until recently, Zend\Crypt), there's still plenty that can go wrong. In particular:

PKCS1v1.5 padding, which is the default (and in many cases the only supported padding mode), is vulnerable to a class of chosen-ciphertext attacks called a padding oracle. This was first discovered by Daniel Bleichenbacher. In 1998.
RSA is not suitable for encrypting large messages, so what implementors often do is take a long message, break it up into fixed-size blocks, and encrypt each block separately. Not only is this slow, it's analogous to the dreaded ECB mode for symmetric-key cryptography.

The Best Thing to Do, with Libsodium
You might want to read JavaScript Cryptography Considered Harmful a few times before going down this route. But that said...

Use TLSv1.2 with HSTS and HPKP, preferably with ChaCha20-Poly1305 and/or AES-GCM and an ECDSA-P256 certificate (important: when the IETF christens Curve25519 and Ed25519, switch to that instead).
Add libsodium.js to your project.
Use crypto_box_seal() with a public key to encrypt your messages, client-side.
In PHP, use \Sodium\crypto_box_seal_open() with the corresponding secret key for the public key to decrypt the message.

I need to use RSA to solve this problem.
Please don't. Elliptic curve cryptography is faster, simpler, and far easier to implement without side-channels. Most libraries do this for you already. (Libsodium!)
But I really want to use RSA!
Fine, follow these recommendations to the letter and don't come crying to StackOverflow when you make a mistake (like SaltStack did) that renders your cryptography useless.
One option (which does not come with a complementary JavaScript implementation, and please don't ask for one) that aims to provide simple and easy RSA encryption is paragonie/easyrsa.

It avoids the padding oracles by using RSA-OAEP with MGF1+SHA256 instead of PKCS1v1.5.
It avoids the ECB mode by clever protocol design:

The EasyRSA Encryption Protocol

EasyRSA generates a random 128-bit key for symmetric key cryptography (via AES).
Your plaintext message is encrypted with defuse/php-encryption.
Your AES key is encrypted with RSA, provided by phpseclib, using the correct mode (mentioned above).
This information is packed together as a simple string (with a checksum).

But, really, if you find a valid use case for public key cryptography, you want libsodium instead.
Bonus: Encryption with JavaScript, Decryption with PHP
We're going to use sodium-plus to accomplish this goal. (Adopted from this post.)
const publicKey = X25519PublicKey.from('fb1a219011c1e0d17699900ef22723e8a2b6e3b52ddbc268d763df4b0c002e73', 'hex');

async function sendEncryptedMessage() {
    let key = await getExampleKey();
    let message = $(""#user-input"").val();
    let encrypted = await sodium.crypto_box_seal(message, publicKey);
    $.post(""/send-message"", {""message"": encrypted.toString('hex')}, function (response) {
        console.log(response);
        $(""#output"").append(""<li><pre>"" + response.message + ""</pre></li>"");
    });
}

And then the congruent PHP code:
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);
require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // Composer
header('Content-Type: application/json');
$keypair = sodium_hex2bin(
    '0202040a9fbf98e1e712b0be8f4e46e73e4f72e25edb72e0cdec026b370f4787' .

);

$encrypted = $_POST['message'] ?? null;
if (!$encrypted) {
    echo json_encode(
        ['message' => null, 'error' => 'no message provided'],
        JSON_PRETTY_PRINT
    );
    exit(1);
}
$plaintext = sodium_crypto_box_seal_open(sodium_hex2bin($encrypted), $keypair);

echo json_encode(
    ['message' => $plaintext, 'original' => $encrypted],

","Your question should be on server fault. It's a basic trouble or I should say two :

on the server side : when you upload your keys on epadmin in your .ssh directory, you have to rename your id_rsa_auto_epmc.pub file in authorized_keys
on the client side : you use a non-default key name for your private key so you have to specify the path to your key by using -i option : ssh -i ~/id_rsa_auto_epmc

No changes is needed to default sshd_config file for key authentification. 
For your question, it should be better to put the ssh command line you use.

","I have solved the issue...
It is related to the account that started the service - its was using the Local System account - this was stopping it accessing the pub key and authorized_keys file.
Once I stopped the service and started as the user I was trying to connect into, it worked!
So basically, you need to start with a service account and then external users connect in as that user.

","If you are using mls-software.com's version of OpenSSH here is another note.
If you install using the SSHD_SERVER account and privilege separation you will be able to use public key authentication (per http://www.mls-software.com/opensshd-pki.html). However if UAC is enable you will not be successful with the install. The user(s) will not be created properly and the service will not be created. Manually trying to get these items up after the fact is very difficult. Simply disabling UAC before installation will allow the installation process to properly create the user(s) and the service. After installation you can re-enable UAC.
When I created the SSHD_SERVER account manually authentication succeed when using password authentication but the client termination the connection with ""/bin/bash: Operation not permitted"". Authentication with public keys was closed by the server (original error posted by Cambolie).

Installing in SSHD_SERVER + privilege separation mode. I also set privilege separation to ""yes"" in the config manually. This didn't work for me for a lot time, the user didn't get created.

For C:\openssh\var\empty I've set ""attributes get/set"" permissions to Everyone and myself and ""full"" permissions to .\sshd_server. I also made it the owner.

So for the purposes of testing, I have been just trying to SSH to localhost, but even when tried remotely I get the same issue.
Even more strange, is that when I have both password & public key enabled in sshd_config, it will only attempt to use keys and then bomb out with the above message and won't even try to use password.
Here are the steps I have taken:

Install OpenSSH for Windows
mkgroup -l >>..\etc\group (added local groups)
mkgroup -d >>..\etc\group (added domain groups)
mkpasswd -L -u openssh >>..\passwd (added my local user)
mkpasswd -D -u jsadmint2232 >>..\passwd (added my domain user)
Edited the homedir in passwd to point to c:\sshusers\%USER% - where %USER% is the user name
Enabled password auth, disabled key auth
Created ssh keys for both jsadmint2232 / openssh and ensured that the files were created in homedirs
Added authorized_keys files into .ssh dirs for each user and added keys for incoming connecting users
net stop opensshd / net start opensshd
Test Password auth works both locally and remotely
Updated sshd_config, to enabled key auth - restart opensshd
Test connection and get above error, also doesn't even try password auth?
Updated sshd_config, to disable password auth completely - restart opensshd
Test connection and still get above error

It appears the server is killing the connection for some reason?
","Following are setup steps for OpenSSH shipped with Windows 10 v.1803 (April 2018 update. See comments to this post, it might not work with 1809).
Server setup (elevated powershell):

Install OpenSSH server: Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0.
Start agent and sshd services: Start-Service ssh-agent; Start-Service sshd (this will generate host keys and default configuration automatically in $env:ProgramData\ssh).
[Optional] Install OpenSSHUtils powershell module: Install-Module -Force OpenSSHUtils

Client setup (non-elevated powershell):

Generate user key: cd $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh; ssh-keygen.exe, follow prompts, agree to the default suggested file location. This will create 2 files: id_rsa and id_rsa.pub;
[Optional] add key to authentication agent, so you don't have to enter password each time you use it: ssh-add .\id_rsa (or whatever file was generated);

Server setup continued (non-elevated powershell):

Log in as a user, for which public key auth to be used
cd $env:USERPROFILE; mkdir .ssh; cd .ssh; New-Item authorized_keys;
Paste the contents of the id_rsa.pub file from the client to the .ssh\authorized_keys file from the previous step.
Setup permissions properly (important!!!): 


Run start . to open explorer with the current folder ($env:USERPROFILE\.ssh);
Right click authorized_keys, go to Properties -> Security -> Advanced
Click ""Disable inheritance"";
Choose ""Convert inherited permissions into explicit permissions on this object"" when prompted;
(really, really important) Remove all permissions on file except for the SYSTEM and yourself. There must be exactly two permission entries on the file. Some guides suggest running the Repair-AuthorizedKeyPermission $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\authorized_keys - this will try to add the sshd user to the permission list and it will break the authentication, so, don't do that, or at least do not agree on adding the sshd user). Both SYSTEM and yourself should have full control over the file.

If your Windows build is 1809 or later, it is required to comment out the following lines in C:\ProgramData\ssh\sshd_config file. Then restart the sshd service.

# Match Group administrators                                                    
#       AuthorizedKeysFile __PROGRAMDATA__/ssh/administrators_authorized_keys  


Client:

Run ssh <serverusername>@<serverhostname>. It should work at this point.

Tried that with Windows 10 as server and both itself and a Debian Linux as a client.

I'm aware I shouldn't be using the sun.misc.* library, and we're looking into the Apache version, but would still like to figure this out (also it will never be production code)
Any advice appreciated.

    return priv;
}


public static PublicKey loadPublicKey(String stored) throws GeneralSecurityException {

    X509EncodedKeySpec spec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(data);
    KeyFactory fact = KeyFactory.getInstance(""DSA"");
    return fact.generatePublic(spec);
}

Edit:
I solved the first command :
openssl genrsa -aes128 -out privkey.pem 2048

But now I'm getting an error with the second:
unknown option –x509

","'genrsa' generates just an RSA key.
'req' then uses that key to make a x509 style request.
If you just need a rsa key pair - use genrsa.
If you need a keypair and a signed x509 request you use 'genrsa' and then 'req'.
Optionally 'req' can also generate that key for you (i.e. it encapsulates the 'genrsa' command (and the gendh). 
So:
 openssl genrsa -aes128 -out privkey.pem 2048
 openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem 

is almost equivalent to
 openssl req -new -x509 -keyout privkey.pem  -newkey rsa:2048

except that unlike 'genrsa', 'req' does not allow you to specify aes128 as the encryption.
So in a lot of enterprise settings one does it in two steps as to get sufficient control over the key encryption applied.

","It's a public key, so theoretically, the channel you use does not have to be encrypted.
Yet, it has to be a channel that prevents a potential attacker from tampering with the key/message. In the worst case the attacker might replace your public key with his own public key, potentially gaining an access instead of you.
So in practice, the best is to use an encrypted channel anyway. At least make sure that your email client uses an encrypted connection to the mail server; and hope that your mail server dispatches the email further using encrypted connection too.

Then, when you want to automate a batch to download from the FTP server the Pageant in order to load the private key into session
http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/pageant.exe
Then use the PSFTP to connect and perform actions
http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/psftp.exe

!--Loading the key to session--!
@C:\pageant.exe ""C:\privatekey.ppk""
!--Calling the PSFTP.exe with the uaser and sftp address + command list file--!
@C:\psftp user@your.server.address -b C:\sftp_cmd.txt

Command list file (sftp_cmd.txt) will like like this:

Whenever you connect to github.com or another ssh services, this key is used first.
Clear the cached keys from ssh-agent using this command:

","The error is because, ssh-add does not know how to talk with the authentication agent.
The problem can be solved by setting SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable.
If you run ssh-agent you should get some output like this:
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-agVZL13989/agent.13989; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK;
SSH_AGENT_PID=13990; export SSH_AGENT_PID;

"25622894","java.security.InvalidKeyException: invalid key format on generating RSA public key","Background:
I have created an applet to extract public key of a certificate extracted from a smart card.
This public key is then stored in database.
The private key of certificate is used to sign data and the public key is then used to verify the signature.
Code for extracting public key from certificate:
private byte[] getPublicKey(KeyStore paramKeyStore)
    throws GeneralSecurityException {
  Enumeration localEnumeration = paramKeyStore.aliases();

  if (localEnumeration.hasMoreElements()) {
    String element = (String) localEnumeration.nextElement();
    Certificate[] arrayOfCertificate =
        paramKeyStore.getCertificateChain(element);
    byte[] publicKeyByteArray =
        arrayOfCertificate[0].getPublicKey().getEncoded();

    return publicKeyByteArray;
  }
  throw new KeyStoreException(""The keystore is empty!"");
}

This publicKeyByteArray is then storeed in database as BLOB after converting to string using bytes2String method:
private static String bytes2String(byte[] bytes) {
  StringBuilder string = new StringBuilder();
  for (byte b : bytes) {
    String hexString = Integer.toHexString(0x00FF & b);
    string.append(hexString.length() == 1 ? ""0"" + hexString : hexString);
  }
  return string.toString();
}

The content of the BLOB(key) saved in database is:
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

After reading the stored public key byte[] from database, I try to convert it back to Public Key using following code: 
Cipher rsa;
rsa = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");
KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
X509EncodedKeySpec publicKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(pkey.getBytes());
PublicKey pk = keyFactory.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);
rsa.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, pk);
byte[] cipherDecrypt = rsa.doFinal(encryptedText.getBytes());

but it gives following error:
Caused by: java.security.InvalidKeyException: invalid key format
    at sun.security.x509.X509Key.decode(X509Key.java:387)

    at sun.security.rsa.RSAKeyFactory.generatePublic(RSAKeyFactory.java:298)
    at sun.security.rsa.RSAKeyFactory.engineGeneratePublic(RSAKeyFactory.java:201)

Please suggest the reason and resolution for this issue.
","You must have an error in the way you read the key back from the database. The following code works just fine for me:
String key = ""3082012230...""; // full key omitted for brevity
byte[] derPublicKey = DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary(key);

KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
X509EncodedKeySpec publicKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(derPublicKey);
keyFactory.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);

I would guess, based on the use of pkey.getBytes(), that you've simply tried to get the bytes from the string rather than hex-decoding it.

","Normally, you use public key encryption to encrypt a symmetric key, in part because public key encryption is very slow. Typically, you'd send the recipient the following, so that they can decrypt your message:

The symmetric key, encrypted with the recipient's public key.
Parameters for the algorithms used, usually an initialization vector for the symmetric cipher.
Identifiers for the encryption algorithms used.
The ciphertext—the actual message, encrypted under the symmetric cipher.

I found the sample code in the JCE documentation sufficient to get things working.
The standard format for bundling all of this information up is the Cryptographic Message Syntax, or CMS, which is used by S/MIME in email applications. I recommend using Bouncy Castle's libraries; they are solid, fairly simple, and actively maintained. The reference documentation is a bit weak, but they do provide code examples.

How can I use Bouncy Castle's PemReader to read only a public key, when no private key information is available?
","EDIT: 
It looks like this depends on what type of key file you are using. For ssh-keygen keys, the private key appears to have a type of AsymmetricCipherKeyPair, but for openssl keys, the private key has a type of RsaPrivateCrtKeyParameters.

Bryan Jyh Herng Chong's answer no longer appears to work for me (at least with Bouncy Castle version v1.8.5). It appears kp.GetType().GetProperty(""Private"") is no longer set differently for public vs private key PEM objects. It also appears that the object returned using PemReader.ReadObject() is now directly a RsaPrivateCrtKeyParameters object, so there's no longer a need to cast through a AsymmetricCipherKeyPair object first.  
I changed that line to this and it worked like a charm:
return (kp.GetType() == typeof(RsaPrivateCrtKeyParameters)) ? MakePrivateRCSP(rsaKey, (RsaPrivateCrtKeyParameters)kp)) : MakePublicRCSP(rsaKey, (RsaKeyParameters)kp);

","RSA keys work on pairs. You can generate ssh private and public keys any number of times..it does not break anything. It simply replaces the old one with a newly generated keys. This only requires you to copy the newly generated public key id_rsa.pub to your remote machine's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file in order for you to access secure shell using rsa keys. 
So generate new rsa keys on your home's .ssh directory (your old keys are replaced by new ones) and copy to the remote host's .ssh directory
cd /home/<your_username>/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub remote_username@host:~/.ssh/authorized_keys

then 
ssh remote_username@host

Keep passphrase empty while generating your new keys unless you want to enter passphrase every time you try to make a ssh connection. 
NOTE: you need to append your public key to authorized_keys file in remote host's ~/.ssh directory if it already exists holding other client's public keys.

","Just in case someone else comes here looking for an answer to the OP's question... and to directly answer that question (namely, how can you re-generate the .pub key in a situation where it is missing, and you only have the private key)... 
Here is the answer:
Regenerating a .pub key from the private key
ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

The -y option is the command teling ssh-keygen to output your public key.
This will re-generate the .pub part of the pair. Just as the OP pointed out, if you simply generate a new pair, and replace the old private key, you will lose access to whatever servers you have already provided your public key to. Sure, you can go through the process of providing a new public key to those servers, but why go through that hassle if it can be easily avoided?

","You are trying to skip a host key checking by setting StrictHostKeyChecking to no.
But you have to do that before the checking, i.e. before the session.connect().

Anyway, you should never do this, unless you do not care about security. The host key checking is there to protect you from man-in-the-middle attacks.
Instead, set up an expected host key to let JSch verify it.
For example:

Call JSch.setKnownHosts providing a path to a .ssh/known_hosts-like file.
To generate the .ssh/known_hosts-like file, you can use an ssh-keyscan command from OpenSSH. If you are connecting from a *nix server, you should have the command available, just run
ssh-keyscan example.com > known_hosts

It will have a format like:
example.com ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEA0hVqZOvZ7yWgie9OHdTORJVI5fJJoH1yEGamAd5G3werH0z7e9ybtq1mGUeRkJtea7bzru0ISR0EZ9HIONoGYrDmI7S+BiwpDBUKjva4mAsvzzvsy6Ogy/apkxm6Kbcml8u4wjxaOw3NKzKqeBvR3pc+nQVA+SJUZq8D2XBRd4EDUFXeLzwqwen9G7gSLGB1hJkSuRtGRfOHbLUuCKNR8RV82i3JvlSnAwb3MwN0m3WGdlJA8J+5YAg4e6JgSKrsCObZK7W1R6iuyuH1zA+dtAHyDyYVHB4FnYZPL0hgz2PSb9c+iDEiFcT/lT4/dQ+kRW6DYn66lS8peS8zCJ9CSQ==

And reference the generated known_hosts file in your JSch code.
If you are on Windows, you can get a Windows build of ssh-keyscan from Win32-OpenSSH project or Git for Windows.
Call JSch.getHostKeyRepository().add() to provide the expected host key (e.g. hard-coded, as your other credentials).

So my work is to check if request's content has not been alterned by verifying signature.
Here is my algorithm :
// 1 - reading public key :
Scanner scanner = new Scanner( new File( keyPath ) );


//            encodedPublicKey.toString( );
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder( );
while ( scanner.hasNextLine( ) )
{
    sb.append( scanner.nextLine( ) );
    sb.append( '\n' );
}

byte[] encodedPublicKey = sb.toString( ).getBytes( ""utf-8"" );

// 2 - loading public key in a relevant object :
X509EncodedKeySpec publicKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec( publicKeyBytes );

KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance( ""DSA"" );

PublicKey publicKey = keyFactory.generatePublic( publicKeySpec );

// 3 - verifying content with signature and content :
Signature sig = Signature.getInstance( ""SHA1withDSA"" );
sig.initVerify( publicKey );
sig.update( message.getBytes( ) );
ret = sig.verify( sign.getBytes( ) );

But for now my algorithm is stoped at ""PublicKey publicKey = keyFactory.generatePublic( publicKeySpec )"" step by this message :
java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException: Inappropriate key specification: invalid key format

So how can I load my key in a way that is accepted by java api ?
","Actually I've found the solution.
The problem was to load in the public key file in the right way.
I'va added bouncycastle library to my dependencies :
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
  <artifactId>bcprov-jdk15on</artifactId>
  <version>1.47</version>
</dependency>

It provides PemReader which allows to read and load non certificated public keys.

You just have to pass signed content, signature and key path to checkSign method and it does all the work.

","Windows 10-64bit
I had installed git, then heroku toolbelt (which I think reinstalled git)
I had C\Program Files (x86)\Heroku\bin in my Environmental variable (probably generated when I installed heroku toolbelt) and if I looked in that filepath I had an ssh-keygen.bat - so it seemed like I should be able to just run ssh-keygen -t rsa from the command line.
That would be too easy, instead I get:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin>ssh-keygen -t rsa -f id_rsa
'""C:\Program Files (x86)\Heroku\..\Git\bin\ssh-keygen.exe""' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

Solution
type bash in command line to go into git bash mode then run ssh-keygen -t rsa
git bash:
mamwo@DESKTOP-9GVG6K8 MINGW32 /bin
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/mamwo/.ssh/id_rsa):

Now when I look in C/User/mamwo/.ssh (the best way for me is through pycharms folder - windows sucks) I see my id_rsa and id_rsa.pub
But this 'cannot generate publickeys' issue all started for me because I had an 'I don't have public keys to add' issue when I cloned my repo (from github) to a new computer and found that I could push to github but not heroku.
Now that I have the keys - I have to add them

I'd like to get exactly the same result as if I were using a PHP function - openssl_public_decrypt ( http://php.net/manual/pl/function.openssl-public-decrypt.php )
I have to do this in my Java project, so I can use Java libs (e.g BouncyCastle, or something else, any recommendations? ) 
Any ideas how to solve this?
Ok, here's my code.
I'm getting the public key like this
PEMReader reader = new PEMReader(new InputStreamReader(ctx

        Object obj;

And I always get the public key without any problems.
Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/NONE/NoPadding"", ""SC"");
c.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, pubKey);
byte[] result = c.doFinal(data_to_decrypt.getBytes());

","Java has got the Java Cryptography Extension Framework, which is just designed for these things.
BouncyCastle is a Cryptography Provider for this framework. This means, it provides your Java Cryptography Extension with implementations of cryptography algorithms.
You'll find the basic classes for this in the packages java.security and javax.crypto
To decrypt your message with a public key you could try the following:
// Use RSA/NONE/NoPadding as algorithm and BouncyCastle as crypto provider
Cipher asymmetricCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/NONE/NoPadding"", ""BC"");

// asume, that publicKeyBytes contains a byte array representing
// your public key

// initialize your cipher
asymmetricCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key);
// asuming, cipherText is a byte array containing your encrypted message
byte[] plainText = asymmetricCipher.doFinal(cipherText);

Please note, that this example is very basic and lacks several try catch blocks. Also, you should not use an asymmetric cipher without padding as this makes you vulnerable to replay attacks. You may also encounter issues with the key length. In some Java packages, the maximum allowed key length is restricted. This may be solved by using the unlimited strength policy files.
I hope, this helps you in getting started with the Java cryptography.

EDIT: The cert file was MD5 signature.
","I struggled a lot with the same problem and finally found a solution. My problem was that I needed to use both an external private and public key for encrypting/decrypting data in an iOS app and didn't want to use the keychain.
It turns out you also need a signed certificate for the iOS security library to be able to read the key data and of course the files have to be in the correct format.
The procedure is basically as follows:
Say you have a private key in PEM format (with the -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- and -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----- markers): rsaPrivate.pem 
//Create a certificate signing request with the private key
openssl req -new -key rsaPrivate.pem -out rsaCertReq.csr

//Create a self-signed certificate with the private key and signing request
openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in rsaCertReq.csr -signkey rsaPrivate.pem -out rsaCert.crt

//Convert the certificate to DER format: the certificate contains the public key
openssl x509 -outform der -in rsaCert.crt -out rsaCert.der

//Export the private key and certificate to p12 file
openssl pkcs12 -export -out rsaPrivate.p12 -inkey rsaPrivate.pem -in rsaCert.crt

Now you have two files which are compatible with the iOS security framework: rsaCert.der (public key) and rsaPrivate.p12 (private key). The code below reads in the public key assuming the file is added to your bundle:
- (SecKeyRef)getPublicKeyRef {

    NSString *resourcePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""rsaCert"" ofType:@""der""];
    NSData *certData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:resourcePath];
    SecCertificateRef cert = SecCertificateCreateWithData(NULL, (CFDataRef)certData);
    SecKeyRef key = NULL;
    SecTrustRef trust = NULL;
    SecPolicyRef policy = NULL;

    if (cert != NULL) {
        policy = SecPolicyCreateBasicX509();
        if (policy) {
            if (SecTrustCreateWithCertificates((CFTypeRef)cert, policy, &trust) == noErr) {
                SecTrustResultType result;
                OSStatus res = SecTrustEvaluate(trust, &result);

                //Check the result of the trust evaluation rather than the result of the API invocation.
                if (result == kSecTrustResultProceed || result == kSecTrustResultUnspecified) {
                    key = SecTrustCopyPublicKey(trust);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    if (policy) CFRelease(policy);
    if (trust) CFRelease(trust);
    if (cert) CFRelease(cert);
    return key;
}

To read in the private key use the following code:
SecKeyRef getPrivateKeyRef() {
    NSString *resourcePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""rsaPrivate"" ofType:@""p12""];
    NSData *p12Data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:resourcePath];

    NSMutableDictionary * options = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];

    SecKeyRef privateKeyRef = NULL;

    //change to the actual password you used here
    [options setObject:@""password_for_the_key"" forKey:(id)kSecImportExportPassphrase];

    CFArrayRef items = CFArrayCreate(NULL, 0, 0, NULL);

    OSStatus securityError = SecPKCS12Import((CFDataRef) p12Data,
                                             (CFDictionaryRef)options, &items);

    if (securityError == noErr && CFArrayGetCount(items) > 0) {
        CFDictionaryRef identityDict = CFArrayGetValueAtIndex(items, 0);
        SecIdentityRef identityApp =
        (SecIdentityRef)CFDictionaryGetValue(identityDict,
                                             kSecImportItemIdentity);

        securityError = SecIdentityCopyPrivateKey(identityApp, &privateKeyRef);
        if (securityError != noErr) {
            privateKeyRef = NULL;
        }
    }
    [options release];
    CFRelease(items);
    return privateKeyRef;
}

Starting with iOS 10, it is actually possible to import PEM private keys w/o converting them to PKCS#12 (which is a very universal container format for everything related to cryptography) and thus also w/o using OpenSSL on command line or statically linking apps with it. On macOS it's even possible since 10.7 using a different function than the ones mentioned here (but so far it doesn't exist for iOS). Exactly the way described below will also work on macOS 10.12 and later, though.
To import a certificate, it's enough to just strip the 
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

and 
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

lines, then run base64 decoding over the data left, the result is a certificate in standard DER format, which can just be fed to SecCertificateCreateWithData() to get a SecCertificateRef. This has always been working, also prior to iOS 10.
To import a private key, a little bit of extra work may be required. If the private key is wrapped with 
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

then it is very easy. Again, the first and last line needs to be stripped, the remaining data needs to be base64 decoded and the result is a RSA key in PKCS#1 format. This format can only hold RSA keys and it is directly readable, just feed the decoded data into SecKeyCreateWithData() to obtain a SecKeyRef. The attributes dictionary just need the following key/value pairs:

kSecAttrKeyType: kSecAttrKeyTypeRSA
kSecAttrKeyClass: kSecAttrKeyClassPrivate 
kSecAttrKeySizeInBits: CFNumberRef with then number of bits in the key (e.g. 1024, 2048, etc.) If not known, this information can actually be read from the raw key data, which is ASN.1 data (it's a bit beyond the scope of this answer, but I will provide some helpful links below about how to parse that format). This value is maybe optional! In my tests it was actually not necessary to set this value; if absent, the API determined the value on its own and it was always set correctly later on.

In case the private key is wrapped by -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----, then the base64 encoded data is not in PKCS#1 format but in PKCS#8 format, however, this is a just a more generic container that can also hold non-RSA keys but for RSA keys the inner data of that container is equal to PKCS#1, so one could say for RSA keys PKCS#8 is PKCS#1 with an extra header and all you need to do is stripping that extra header. Just strip the first 26 bytes of the base64 decoded data and you have PKCS#1 again. Yes, it's really that simple.
To learn more about PKCS#x formats in PEM encodings, have a look at this site. To learn more about ASN.1 format, here's a good site for that. And if you need a simple, yet powerful and interactive online ASN.1 parser to play around with different formats, one that can directly read PEM data, as well as ASN.1 in base64 and hexdump, try this site.
Very important: When adding a private key to keychain, that you created as above, please be aware that such a private key doesn't contain a public key hash, yet a public key hash is important for they keychain API to form an identity (SecIdentityRef), as using the public key hash is how the API finds the correct private key that belongs to an imported certificate (a SecIdentityRef is just a SecKeyRef of a private key and a SecCertificateRef of a cert forming a combined object and it's the public key hash, that binds them together). So when you plan to add the private key to keychain, be sure to set a public key hash manually, otherwise you won't ever be able to get an identity for it and without that you cannot use keychain API for tasks like signing or decrypting data. The public key hash must be stored in an attribute named kSecAttrApplicationLabel (stupid name, I know, but it's really not a label and nothing the user can ever see, check out the documentation). E.g.:
OSStatus error = SecItemAdd(
    (__bridge CFDictionaryRef)@{
        (__bridge NSString *)kSecClass: 
            (__bridge NSString *)kSecClassKey,
        (__bridge NSString *)kSecAttrApplicationLabel: 
             hashOfPublicKey, // hashOfPublicKey is NSData *
#if TARGET_OS_IPHONE
        (__bridge NSString *)kSecValueRef: 
            (__bridge id)privateKeyToAdd, // privateKeyToAdd is SecKeyRef
#else
        (__bridge NSString *)kSecUseItemList: 
              @[(__bridge id)privateKeyToAdd], // privateKeyToAdd is SecKeyRef
              // @[ ... ] wraps it into a NSArray object,
              // as kSecUseItemList expects an array of items
#endif
     },
     &outReference // Can also be NULL,
                   // otherwise reference to added keychain entry
                   // that must be released with CFRelease()
);

EDIT: The cert file was MD5 signature.
","After hours of effort researching online with the help of this post, I finally get it working perfectly. Here is the notes with working Swift code of the most current version. I hope it can help someone!

Received a certificate in the base64 encoded string sandwiched between header and tail like this (PEM format):
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

strip out the header and the tail, such as  
// remove the header string  
let offset = (""-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----"").characters.count  
let index = certStr.index(cerStr.startIndex, offsetBy: offset+1)  
cerStr = cerStr.substring(from: index)  

// remove the tail string 
let tailWord = ""-----END CERTIFICATE-----""   
if let lowerBound = cerStr.range(of: tailWord)?.lowerBound {  
cerStr = cerStr.substring(to: lowerBound)  
}

decode base64 string to NSData:
let data = NSData(base64Encoded: cerStr, 
   options:NSData.Base64DecodingOptions.ignoreUnknownCharacters)!  

Convert it from NSdata format to SecCertificate:
let cert = SecCertificateCreateWithData(kCFAllocatorDefault, data)

Now, this cert can be used to compare with the certificate received from the urlSession trust: 
certificateFromUrl = SecTrustGetCertificateAtIndex(...)
if cert == certificate {
}

or

or anything that doesn't put the key in base64 plaintext in a single string. Probably also something that doesn't store the key in base64 would be a good idea too, since raw base64 text fragments are pretty easy to spot.
It's not a particularly GOOD way to protect the key. But it protects against a trivial attack where somebody just searches through literal strings in you APK looking for something that looks like a base64-encoded public key. At least you make the #$#$ers work a little bit.
Presumably evil people can do bad things if they identify your public key. Google seems to think so, apparently. I can guess what this step does, but I'm not sure I really want to speculate on that in an open forum, and give anyone any ideas.  You want to do it though.
The basic plot summary would be that you're making it more difficult for somebody to write an application that programmatically de-LVLs an applciation.
One assumes that anyone who's doing this makes a living cracking 20 or 30,000 android apps and republishing them. Chances are, I suppose that they're not going to take the extra ten minutes to add your app to the list of 20,000 Android apps that have already been broken by a program, if they actually have to do a little bit of manual work. Unless you have a top tier application. And then the battle is potentially endless, and probably ultimately futile.
Splitting the key into consecutive chunks (as proposed in another answer) probably isn't good enough. Because the key will end up in consecutive strings in the string constant tables in the APK. Too easy to find that with a program.

String base64EncodedPublicKey = ""CONSTRUCT_YOUR_KEY_AND_PLACE_IT_HERE"";

Well I am not sure I understand this security measure. I know how to get the application public key (which is already base 64 encoded) from Google Play Developer Console. 
What I am not understanding is this part
 /* Instead of just storing the entire literal string here embedded in the
 * program,  construct the key at runtime from pieces or
 * use bit manipulation (for example, XOR with some other string) to hide
 * the actual key
 */

As far as I know, this public key is a constant string, which is given from Google during application upload process. 
How can we create the same key programmatically using any bit manipulation process? Has someone done it before? Is there any sample code on how to do this?
","An alternative is to do some basic transforms on the key.
// Replace this with your encoded key.
String base64EncodedPublicKey = """";

// Get byte sequence to play with.
byte[] bytes = base64EncodedPublicKey.getBytes();

// Swap upper and lower case letters.
for (int i = 0; i < bytes.length; i++) {
    if(bytes[i] >= 'A' && bytes[i] <= 'Z')
        bytes[i] = (byte)( 'a' + (bytes[i] - 'A'));
    else if(bytes[i] >= 'a' && bytes[i] <= 'z')
        bytes[i] = (byte)( 'A' + (bytes[i] - 'a'));
}

// Assign back to string.
base64EncodedPublicKey = new String( bytes );

So the idea would be to put your original key in as base64EncodedPublicKey and run the above code, it would swap lower and uppercase letters and put the result back in base64EncodedPublicKey. You can then copy the result from the debugger and paste it into code as the original base64EncodedPublicKey value. At this point your key will be transformed (upper and lower case switched) and at runtime it'll fix it back to the correct casing, and continue to work.
The above is obviously quite a basic transcode, but you can be more creative, reverse the ordering of A-Z, swap odd and even numbers, swap vowels for even numbers. The issue here is that if I put code in the above snippet that does a bunch of more interesting transcodes, and then everyone copy and pastes that into their projects, a cracker will easily be able to see and use the transcode themselves (from looking at this post)! So you just have to come up with a few transforms yourself.
I've purposely made the above work in both direction (so if you run it twice, you'll get your original value back) as it makes it easy to run the algorithm on your original key. I think it is kind of neat it looks like the real key is sitting there as plain text, a casual cracker may try to switch this and then be confused when it doesn't work.

","The key of asymmetric cryptography is to have an asymmetric function which allow decrypting message encrypted by the asymmetric key, without allowing to find the other key. In RSA, the function used is based on factorization of prime numbers however it is not the only option (Elliptic curve is another one for example).
So, basically you need two prime numbers for generating a RSA key pair. If you are able to factorize the public key and find these prime numbers, you will then be able to find the private key. The whole security of RSA is based on the fact that it is not easy to factorize large composite numbers, that's why the length of the key highly change the robustness of the RSA algorithm.
There are competitions to factorize large prime numbers with calculators each years with nice price. The last step of factorizing RSA key was done in 2009 by factorizing 768 bits keys. That's why at least 2048 bit keys should be used now.
As usual, Wikipedia is a good reference on RSA.

","RSA uses the idea of one-way math functions, so that it's easy to encrypt and decrypt if you have the key, but hard (as in it takes lots and lots of CPU cycles) to decrypt if you don't have the key. Even before they thought of using prime numbers, mathematicians identified the need for a one-way function.
The first method they hit upon was the idea that if your ""key"" is a prime number, and your message is another number, then you can encrypt by multiplying the two together. Someone with the key can easily divide out the prime number and get the message, but for someone without the prime number, figuring out the prime number key is hard.

","All public key algorithms are based on trapdoor functions, that is, mathematical constructs that are ""easy"" to compute in one way, but ""hard"" to reverse unless you have also some additional information (used as private key) at which point also the reverse becomes ""easy"".
""Easy"" and ""hard"" are just qualitative adjectives that are always more formally defined in terms of computational complexity. ""Hard"" very often refers to computations that cannot be solved in polynomial time O(nx) for some fixed x and where n is the input data.
In the case of RSA, the ""easy"" function is the modular exponentiation C = Me mod N where the factors of N are kept secret. The ""hard"" problem is to find the e-th root of C (that is, M). Of course, ""hard"" does not mean that it is always hard, but (intuitively) that increasing the size of N by a certain factor increases the complexity by a much larger factor.
The sizes of the modulus which are recommended (2048 bits, or 617 decimal digits) relate to the availability of computation power at present time, so that if you stick to them you are assured that it will be extremely expensive for the attacker to break it. For more details, I should refer you to a brilliant answer on cryptography.SE (go and upvote :-)).
Finally, in order to have a trapdoor, N is built so as to be a composite number. It theory, for improved performance, N may have more than 2 factors, but the general security rule is that all factors must be balanced and have roughly the same size. That means that if you have K factors, and N is B bits long, each factor is roughly B/K bits longs.
This problem to solve is not the same as the integer factorization problem though. The two are related in that if you manage to factor N you can compute the private key by re-doing what the party that generated the key did. Typically, the exponent e being used is very small (3); it cannot be excluded that someday somebody devises an algorithm to compute the e-th without factoring N.
EDIT: Corrected the number of decimal digits for the modulus of a 2048 bits RSA key.

","It appears that there are some problems with your cygwin setup, which is why the user/group is not showing up correctly.  You need to run mkgroup to generate your /etc/group, and possibly mkpasswd as well.   I had a similar problem - I had to run mkpasswd to regenerate my /etc/passwd.  After running mkpasswd, I could finally ssh into my localhost.  It's a shame the debug info does not log enough info to easily diagnose the problem.

","Quick double-check, did you add your public key or private key to authorized_keys? It needs to be your public key.
I notice that the server is not responding with a ""Server accepts key..."" upon receipt of your pubkey_test and I have seen that when the public key is missing from the authorized_keys file on the server you're connecting to.  You should see:
debug3: send_pubkey_test
debug2: we sent a publickey packet, wait for reply
debug1: Server accepts key: pkalg ssh-rsa blen 279

Easiest way to set it up is to use ssh-copy-id to do the work, e.g.,:
# ssh-copy-id localhost

That will create your authorized_keys file with the correct permissions.  When you run this, you will be prompted for your password, because the server doesn't have the key.  Once this command runs successfully, you'll be able to simply ssh to the server using your identity file.  Note that ssh_config defaults the identity file to ~/.ssh/identity, ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa, so if you want to use a different file, you should set up an alias in ~/.ssh/config.
Hope this helps.

","I had a similar problem setting up public key authentication (with similar verbose output from the client), though I was trying to do it from an Ubuntu client to a Cygwin SSHD server, and it was a very old Cygwin environment (version 1.5.12 on Windows 2000!).   I had copied the public key using ssh-copy-id.
In my case, making the authorized_keys files world readable (mode 644) on the Cygwin side appeared to allow public key authentication to succeed.   
From what I've seen, mode 600 is standard, so perhaps this ""fix"" in my case is actually a sign of a problem elsewhere in the Cygwin SSHD setup. But now that pub key authentication is finally working, I probably won't be digging any deeper.

","My problem was that I thought cygwin is OK if its files gets copy and pasted, so if I wanted to clone the installation I just copied and pasted C:\cygiwn64 folder somewhere else and ran the .bat file.  
But I was wrong. Every time you copy a file with windows explorer the permission and ownerships gets corrupted in cygwin. So dont use windows explorer for making changes to any of the cygwin files, only use the command line apps like cp, mkdir, mv, vim, nano and others.  
Also If you want to create a new installation just use the setup_x86_64.exe file and simply choose a new root directory for it and let the setup install packages and do the rest for you.
This way you make sure that nothing gets corrupted and you wont get surprised by some amazing error messages in the future.

Given p and q the two primes, and phi=(p-1)(q-1), and the public exponent (0x10001), how do i get the secret exponent 'd' ?
I've read that i have to do: d = e-1 mod phi using modular inversion and the euclidean equation but i cannot understand how the above formula maps to either the a-1 ≡ x mod m formula on the modular inversion wiki page, or how it maps to the euclidean GCD equation.
Can someone help please, cheers
","You can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to solve for d in the congruence
de = 1 mod phi(m)

For RSA encryption, e is the encryption key, d is the decryption key,  and encryption
and decryption are both performed by exponentiation mod m.  If you encrypt a message a
with key e, and then decrypt it using key d, you calculate (ae)d = ade mod m.  But
since de = 1 mod phi(m), Euler's totient theorem tells us that ade is congruent 
to a1 mod m -- in other words, you get back the original a.
There are no known efficient ways to obtain the decryption key d knowing only the
encryption key e and the modulus m, without knowing the factorization m = pq, so
RSA encryption is believed to be secure.

you need to add some developer SSH public keys to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file for that user.
  Let’s assume you’ve received a few keys by e-mail and saved them to temporary files. Again, the public keys look something like this:

$ cat /tmp/id_rsa.john.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCB007n/ww+ouN4gSLKssMxXnBOvf9LGt4L

(Note: make sure the key is displayed on one single line)

You just append them to your authorized_keys file:

$ cat /tmp/id_rsa.john.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

If you don't have an authorized_keys file on your server, create it, but make sure to protect it correctly.
server$ mkdir ~/.ssh
server$ chmod 700 ~/.ssh
server$ cat ~/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
server$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
server$ rm ~/id_rsa.pub

See ""Creating SSH keys for Gerrit and Hudson"" for a concrete example.

Make sure git is in the PATH used by your ssh daemon.

","You actually don't need to implement INotifyPropertyChanged. However, this will be a one time data binding. 
For example in XAML:

    public MainWindow()

","The .p12 contains both the private and the public key, and also information about the owner (name, email address, etc. ) all being certified by a third party. With such certificate, a user can identify himself and authenticate himself to any organization trusting the third party.

How do I get the correct public key?
How to get the private key?

","To extend Uwe's answer, the reason you see different values is your strange handling of the public key data:
RSAPublicKey pubkey = (RSAPublicKey) cert.getPublicKey();
tempPub = pubkey.getEncoded();
sPub = new String( tempPub );
field=hex(sPub);
System.out.println(""Public key : \n"" + field );

Here you are creating a string from a stream of bytes (never a good idea) and then hex-encoding the result. No wonder it looks weird! In fact, your hex method looks very strange and probably should be thrown away.
Instead, just try this:
RSAPublicKey pubkey = (RSAPublicKey) cert.getPublicKey();
field = DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(pubkey.getEncoded());
System.out.println(""Public key : \n"" + field );

If you are using Java 5 or below, Google for a decent byte-to-hex function as DatatypeConverter is not available.

","You cannot generate either key directly from the other. It is mathematically impossible. If you had a key blob that contained both the public and private keys, you could extract either one of them with relative ease.
EDIT, 2017: Many years and a much better understanding of crypto later, and it's now clear to me that this answer isn't really correct.
To quote Wikipedia:

The public key consists of the modulus n and the public (or encryption) exponent e. The private key consists of the modulus n and the private (or decryption) exponent d, which must be kept secret. p, q, and λ(n) must also be kept secret because they can be used to calculate d.

The public modulus n can be computed as p × q. The only thing missing from a raw private key is e, but this value is usually selected as 65537, and if not you can still compute e from d and λ(n).
However, many private key storage formats actually contain the public modulus n alongside the other components, so you can just do a direct extraction of the values.
EDIT, 2018: Still getting downvotes for this, and rightly so! I'm leaving this answer up so people can see why I was originally wrong, and to remind myself not to be wrong in future.

","The assumption is that we are talking about RSA private and Public keys. Then, if you are working from a PEM format file, then first you need to read the private key from the file into a PrivateKey object:
    public PrivateKey readPemRsaPrivateKey(String pemFilename) throws
            java.io.IOException,
            java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException,
            java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException
    {
            String pemString = File2String(pemFilename);

            pemString = pemString.replace(""-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"", """");
            pemString = pemString.replace(""-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"", """");

            byte[] decoded = Base64.decodeBase64(pemString);

            PKCS8EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(decoded);
            KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");

            return kf.generatePrivate(keySpec);
    }

where File2String is something like:
    private static String File2String(String fileName) throws
            java.io.FileNotFoundException, java.io.IOException
    {
            File file = new File(fileName);

            char[] buffer = null;

            BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));

            buffer = new char[(int)file.length()];

            int i = 0;
            int c = bufferedReader.read();

            while (c != -1) {
                    buffer[i++] = (char)c;
                    c = bufferedReader.read();
            }
            return new String(buffer);
    }

Now you can generate the corresponding PublicKey with code like this:
    import java.security.interfaces.RSAPrivateCrtKey;
    import java.security.spec.RSAPublicKeySpec;

...
    PrivateKey myPrivateKey = readPemRsaPrivateKey(myPrivateKeyPemFileName);
    RSAPrivateCrtKey privk = (RSAPrivateCrtKey)myPrivateKey;

    RSAPublicKeySpec publicKeySpec = new java.security.spec.RSAPublicKeySpec(privk.getModulus(), privk.getPublicExponent());

    KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
    PublicKey myPublicKey = keyFactory.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);

Chrome 55 and above You can now find this information in Developer Tools. Options (3 dots) -> More Tools -> Developer tools, or press F12, then click the ""Security"" tab and you'll get a ""Security Overview"" with a ""View certificate"" button. As per another SO post from Chrome 60 you can actually enable the option again if you go to chrome://flags/#show-cert-link.
Chrome 54 and below: If you're using Chrome then click on the green bar to the left of the 'https:' in the address bar, for the VeriSign website the green bar says Symantec Corperation [US], this will open a pop up. On the pop up click 'Certificate Information'. This will open another pop up. On this go the 'Details' tab at the top and scroll down to 'Public key' which shows the public key the website is using for it's SSL. In VeriSigns case the public key is a 2048 bit key.

IE: the green bar to click on is to the right of the web address. Clicking this brings a similar pop up where you have to click 'View certificates' which then brings up the same pop up as on Chrome where you go to the Details tab and scroll down to 'Public Key'

This is the pop up that opens after clicking the 'Certificate information' or 'View certificates' links.

","It usually is a permission issue.
The chmod on the parent directories of your config file might be different between your two computers.
(and I am not talking about just the immediate parent directory .ssh, but also all the parent directories)
See ""Git SSH authentication"", but also know that if any of the parent directories is writable for group or world, ssh won't work.

Note also that your second command is not right, and should be:
git clone ubuntu@ec2xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com/var/www/project.git

no ':' (a ':' means using a config file, with an scp-like syntax)
it can only work if you have ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub though.
If you have mykey.pem, then you need a config file for ssh to know where are your public and private keys, which means only this can work:
git clone ec2server:/var/www/project.git

","Recently I had to re-install the system which held the working configuration and I have not managed to replicate it, so it's not about the linux version (very likely). What I managed to do, is that I managed to use the mentioned original script to clone the repository into my home directory. Here it picked up the name correctly, but if I navigated into /var/www, what I was doing before, it just gave me the same error: could ec2server not found ... . So I figure the problem has to do something with the permissions + commands combination. If anyone can figure it out how to make it work, I will mark he's response as a correct answer, until then I am marking mine as the correct one, since this is the closest to the correct.
UPDATE 
I figured it out what was the problem: I had to change the permission on /var/www folder in order to be able to clone into that directory. Now it's 777 ( used only for dev on a local machine).

Looking at the keys found when logging into the digitalocean website shows the correct key.
","The issue was on the server-side authorized_keys, but not the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. It was in a separate /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys file, where I had to add the ssh-keys. Once I did this the issue went away. Not sure how it got removed from that file since I hadn't modified it.
This video helped.

Alice is connected to Bob over a network
Alice and Bob want secure communications
Alice generates a public / private key pair and sends public key to Bob
Bob receives public key and encrypts a randomly generated symmetric cypher key (e.g. blowfish) with the public key and sends the result to Alice
Alice decrypts the ciphertext with the originally generated private key and obtains the symmetric blowfish key
Alice and Bob now both have knowledge of symmetric blowfish key and can establish a secure communication channel 

Now, I have looked at the openssl/rsa.h rsa implementation (since I already have practical experience with openssl/blowfish.h), and I see these two functions:
int RSA_public_encrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa, int padding);
int RSA_private_decrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
 unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa, int padding);

If Alice is to generate *rsa, how does this yield the rsa key pair? Is there something like rsa_public and rsa_private which are derived from rsa? Does *rsa contain both public and private key and the above function automatically strips out the necessary key depending on whether it requires the public or private part? Should two unique *rsa pointers be generated so that actually, we have the following:
int RSA_public_encrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa_public, int padding);
int RSA_private_decrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
 unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa_private, int padding);

Secondly, in what format should the *rsa public key be sent to Bob? Must it be reinterpreted in to a character array and then sent the standard way? I've heard something about certificates -- are they anything to do with it?

","Actually, no problem, I have just read that basically, the RSA object is a structure that contains both public and private fields. One can extract the public field data and only send that to Bob.
I.e. basically, to extract the public fields from rsa and store each in two different buffers (which are char arrays and can then be sent to Bob), you do:
sprintf(keyBufferA,""%s\r\n"",BN_bn2hex(rsa->n));
sprintf(keyBufferB,""%s\r\n"",BN_bn2hex(rsa->e));

And then Bob, on the receiving end, reconstructs as follows:
rsa = RSA_new();
BN_hex2bn(&rsa->n, keybufA);
BN_hex2bn(&rsa->e, keybufB);

Bob can then use rsa* to publicly encrypt the symmetric cypher key which can then be sent to Alice. Alice can then decrypt with the private key

","You should actually be using the higher-level ""Envelope Encryption"" functions from openssl/evp.h, rather than the low-level RSA functions directly.  These do most of the work for you and mean you don't have to reinvent the wheel.
In this case, you'd use the EVP_SealInit(), EVP_SealUpdate() and EVP_SealFinal() functions.  The corresponding decryption functions are EVP_OpenInit(), EVP_OpenUpdate() and EVP_OpenFinal().  I would suggest using EVP_aes_128_cbc() as the value of the cipher type parameter.
Once you've got the public key loaded into an RSA * handle, you use EVP_PKEY_assign_RSA() to put it into an EVP_PKEY * handle for the EVP functions.
Once you've got this going, to solve the authentication problem I mentioned in my comment, you'll need to established a trusted authority (""Trent"").  Trent's public key is known to all users (distributed with the application or similar - just load it from a PEM file).  Instead of exchanging bare RSA parameters, Alice and Bob exchange x509 certificates that contain their RSA public keys together with their name, and are signed by Trent.  Alice and Bob then each verify the certificate they recieved from the other (using Trent's public key, which they already know), including checking that the associated name is the right one, before continuing the protocol.  OpenSSL includes functions for loading and verifying certificates in the x509.h header.

Here's an example of how to use EVP_Seal*() to encrypt a file given the recipient's public key.  It takes the PEM RSA Public Key file (ie as generated by openssl rsa -pubout) as a command line argument, reads the source data from stdin and writes the encrypted data to stdout.  To decrypt, use EVP_Open*() instead, and PEM_read_RSAPrivateKey() to read a private key rather than public key.
It's not really that hard - and certainly less error prone than messing about generating padding, IVs and so on yourself (the Seal function does both the RSA and AES parts of the deal).  Anyway, the code:

The code you've posted illustrates nicely why you should use the higher-level functions - you've fallen into a couple of pitfalls:

rand() is emphatically not a cryptographically strong random number generator! Generating your symmetric key using rand() is enough to make the entire system completely insecure. (The EVP_*() functions generate the necessary random numbers themselves, using a cryptographically strong RNG, seeded from an appropriate entropy source).
You are setting the IV for CFB mode to a fixed value (zero).  This negates any advantage of using CFB mode in the first place (allowing attackers to trivially perform block-replacement attacks and worse).  (The EVP_*() functions generate an appropriate IV for you, when required).
RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING should be used if you're defining a new protocol, rather than interoperating with an existing protocol.

"2012645","Can you help me get my head around openssl public key encryption with rsa.h in c++?","I am trying to get my head around public key encryption using the openssl implementation of rsa in C++. Can you help? So far these are my thoughts (please do correct if necessary)

Alice is connected to Bob over a network
Alice and Bob want secure communications
Alice generates a public / private key pair and sends public key to Bob
Bob receives public key and encrypts a randomly generated symmetric cypher key (e.g. blowfish) with the public key and sends the result to Alice
Alice decrypts the ciphertext with the originally generated private key and obtains the symmetric blowfish key
Alice and Bob now both have knowledge of symmetric blowfish key and can establish a secure communication channel 

Now, I have looked at the openssl/rsa.h rsa implementation (since I already have practical experience with openssl/blowfish.h), and I see these two functions:
int RSA_public_encrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa, int padding);
int RSA_private_decrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
 unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa, int padding);

If Alice is to generate *rsa, how does this yield the rsa key pair? Is there something like rsa_public and rsa_private which are derived from rsa? Does *rsa contain both public and private key and the above function automatically strips out the necessary key depending on whether it requires the public or private part? Should two unique *rsa pointers be generated so that actually, we have the following:
int RSA_public_encrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa_public, int padding);
int RSA_private_decrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
 unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa_private, int padding);

Secondly, in what format should the *rsa public key be sent to Bob? Must it be reinterpreted in to a character array and then sent the standard way? I've heard something about certificates -- are they anything to do with it?
Sorry for all the questions,
Best Wishes,
Ben.

","I write two examples around CAF's code. They are heavily modifed and uses OpenSSL's BIO container for more abstraction. 
One example uses a file as input and the other example uses a string buffer. It uses RSA and DES, however you can easily change it from the code. Compile instructions are inside the code. I needed a working example, I hope someone find this useful. I also commented the code. You can get it from here:

"13845470","Extract Public Key using pyOpenSSL from certificate or other connection information","I'm currently trying to write a python server script which should authenticate the current client based on its public key. Since I'm using twisted, the example in the twisted documenteation got me started.
While I can generate keys, connect and communicate using the example code, I have not yet found a way to get the public key of the client in a usable format. In this stackexchange question somebody extracts the public key from an OpenSSL.crypto.PKey object but cannot transform it to a readable format. Since in I have access to the PKey object of the x509 certificate in the verifyCallback method or via self.transport.getPeerCertificate() from any method of my Protocol, this would be a good way to go. The (not accepted) answer suggests to try crypto.dump_privatekey(PKey). Unfortunately, this does not really yield the expected result:
While the BEGIN PRIVATE KEY and BEGIN PRIVATE KEY in the answer could be fixed by an easy text replacement function, the base64 string seems not match the public key. I've extracted the public key with openssl rsa -in client.key -pubout > client.pub as mentioned here. It does not match the result of the dump_privatekey function.
While there still is an open bug towards OpenSSL on launchpad, it is not yet fixed. It was reported 19 Month ago, and there is some recent (October 2012) activity on it, I do not have any hope of a fast fix in the repos.
Do you have any other ideas how I could get the public key in a format comparable to the client.pub file I have mentioned above? Perhaps there is a twisted or OpenSSL connection specific object which holds this information. Please note that I have to store the public key in the protocol object such that I can access it later. 
Why is no Answer accepted?
M2Crypto by J.F. Sebastian
Sorry, that I had not thought of a possibility where I cannot correlate the certificate to the connection. I've added the requirement that I have to store the public key inside the protocol instance. Thus, using peerX509.as_pem() inside the postConnectionCheck function as suggested by J.F. Sebastian does not work. Furthermore, at least in version 0.21.1-2ubuntu3 of python-m2crypto I have to call peerX509.get_rsa().as_pem() to get the right public key. Using peerX509.as_pem(None) (since peerX509.as_pem() still wants a passphrase) yields excactly the same output as crypto.dump_privatekey(PKey) in PyOpenSSL. Maybe there is a bug.
Besides this, the answer showed me a possible way to write another workaround by using the following Echo protocol class:
class Echo(Protocol):
    def dataReceived(self, data):
        """"""As soon as any data is received, write it back.""""""
        if self.transport.checked and not self.pubkeyStored:
            self.pubkeyStored = True
            x509 = m2.ssl_get_peer_cert(self.transport.ssl._ptr())
            if x509 is not None:
                x509 = X509.X509(x509, 1)
                pk = x509.get_pubkey()
                self.pubkey = pk.get_rsa().as_pem()
                print pk.as_pem(None)
            print self.pubkey
        self.transport.write(data)

As you can see this uses some internal classes which I'd like to prevent. I'm hesitating submitting a small patch which would add a getCert method to the TLSProtocolWrapper class in M2Crypto.SSL.TwistedProtocolWrapper. Even if it was accepted upstream, it would break compatibility of my script with any but the most cut-of-the-edge versions of m2crypto. What would you do?
External OpenSSL call by me
Well, its an ugly workaround based on external system commands just which seems to me even worse than accessing non-public attributes.
","The analog of openssl rsa -in client.key -pubout > client.pub command in M2Crypto (a more complete openssl wrapper than pyOpenSSL) is:
def save_pub_key(cert, filename):
    cert.get_pubkey().get_rsa().save_pub_key(filename)

You can use M2Crypto instead of pyOpenSSL with twisted. To add ssl capabilities to the echo server:
from twisted.internet import protocol, reactor

class Echo(protocol.Protocol):
    def dataReceived(self, data):
        self.transport.write(data)

class EchoFactory(protocol.Factory):
    def buildProtocol(self, addr):
        return Echo()

You could:
import sys
from twisted.python import log

from M2Crypto import SSL, X509
from M2Crypto.SSL import Checker
from M2Crypto.SSL.TwistedProtocolWrapper import listenSSL

log.startLogging(sys.stderr)    
cert = X509.load_cert('client.crt')
check = Checker.Checker(peerCertHash=cert.get_fingerprint('sha1'))

def postConnectionCheck(peerX509, expectedHost):
    log.msg(""client cert in pem format:\n"", peerX509.as_pem())
    save_pub_key(peerX509, 'client.pub')
    return check(peerX509, host=None) # don't check client hostname

class SSLContextFactory:
    def getContext(self):
        ctx = SSL.Context()
        ctx.load_verify_locations(cafile='ca.crt')
        ctx.load_cert(certfile='server.crt', keyfile='server.key',
                      callback=lambda *a,**kw: 'keyfile passphrase')
        ctx.set_verify(SSL.verify_peer | SSL.verify_fail_if_no_peer_cert,
                       depth=9, callback=None)
        return ctx
listenSSL(8000, EchoFactory(), SSLContextFactory(),
          interface='localhost',  reactor=reactor,
          postConnectionCheck=postConnectionCheck)
reactor.run()

To try it, create self-signed certificates:
$ openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out server.crt -keyout server.key
# NOTE: server.key is unencrypted!
$ cp {server,client}.crt
$ cp {server,client}.key
$ cp {server,ca}.crt

and connect to the server:
$ openssl s_client -cert client.crt -key client.key -CAfile ca.crt \
   -verify 9 -connect localhost:8000 -no_ssl2

The server saves the client's public key to the client.pub file. It is identical to the one created by openssl command:
$ openssl rsa -in client.key -pubout > openssl_client.pub
$ diff -s {openssl_,}client.pub

In this stackexchange question somebody extracts the public key from an OpenSSL.crypto.PKey object but cannot transform it to a readable format.

The (not accepted) answer suggests to try crypto.dump_privatekey(PKey). Unfortunately, this does not really yield the expected result:
While the BEGIN PRIVATE KEY and BEGIN PRIVATE KEY in the answer could be fixed by an easy text replacement function, the base64 string seems not match the public key. I've extracted the public key with openssl rsa -in client.key -pubout > client.pub as mentioned here. It does not match the result of the dump_privatekey function.
While there still is an open bug towards OpenSSL on launchpad, it is not yet fixed. It was reported 19 Month ago, and there is some recent (October 2012) activity on it, I do not have any hope of a fast fix in the repos.
Do you have any other ideas how I could get the public key in a format comparable to the client.pub file I have mentioned above? Perhaps there is a twisted or OpenSSL connection specific object which holds this information. Please note that I have to store the public key in the protocol object such that I can access it later.

M2Crypto by J.F. Sebastian
Sorry, that I had not thought of a possibility where I cannot correlate the certificate to the connection. I've added the requirement that I have to store the public key inside the protocol instance. Thus, using peerX509.as_pem() inside the postConnectionCheck function as suggested by J.F. Sebastian does not work. Furthermore, at least in version 0.21.1-2ubuntu3 of python-m2crypto I have to call peerX509.get_rsa().as_pem() to get the right public key. Using peerX509.as_pem(None) (since peerX509.as_pem() still wants a passphrase) yields excactly the same output as crypto.dump_privatekey(PKey) in PyOpenSSL. Maybe there is a bug.
Besides this, the answer showed me a possible way to write another workaround by using the following Echo protocol class:
class Echo(Protocol):
    def dataReceived(self, data):
        """"""As soon as any data is received, write it back.""""""
        if self.transport.checked and not self.pubkeyStored:
            self.pubkeyStored = True
            x509 = m2.ssl_get_peer_cert(self.transport.ssl._ptr())
            if x509 is not None:
                x509 = X509.X509(x509, 1)
                pk = x509.get_pubkey()
                self.pubkey = pk.get_rsa().as_pem()
                print pk.as_pem(None)
            print self.pubkey
        self.transport.write(data)

As you can see this uses some internal classes which I'd like to prevent. I'm hesitating submitting a small patch which would add a getCert method to the TLSProtocolWrapper class in M2Crypto.SSL.TwistedProtocolWrapper. Even if it was accepted upstream, it would break compatibility of my script with any but the most cut-of-the-edge versions of m2crypto. What would you do?

External OpenSSL call by me
Well, its an ugly workaround based on external system commands just which seems to me even worse than accessing non-public attributes.
","I made it working finally using pyOpenSSL and DerSequence class from Crypto.Util.asn1 (pyasn1 library).
Here is a method from my RSAKey class (pkey is a OpenSSL.crypto.PKey instance)  :
from OpenSSL.crypto import dump_privatekey, FILETYPE_ASN1
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Util.asn1 import DerSequence
from base64 import b64decode, b64encode

...

def fromPKey_PublicKey(self, pkey):
    src = dump_privatekey(FILETYPE_ASN1, pkey)
    pub_der = DerSequence()
    pub_der.decode(src)
    self.key = RSA.construct((long(pub_der._seq[1]), long(pub_der._seq[2])))

The key here is that first item in pub_der._seq is zero and we dont need it.
Than you can convert RSA key stored in self.key to any format you want:
def toPEM_PublicKey(self):
    pemSeq = DerSequence()
    pemSeq[:] = [ self.key.key.n, self.key.key.e ]
    s = b64encode(pemSeq.encode())
    src = '-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----\n'
    while True:
        src += s[:64] + '\n'
        s = s[64:]
        if s == '':
            break
    src += '-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----'
    return src

I am currently working with CSpace project, it uses ""ncrypt"" library ( this is another OpenSSL wrapper ) wich is not supported anymore and it gives SegFault on Linux. So I decided to replace ncrypt library with pyOpenSSL because I am using it in my project called DataHaven.NET.

","I'm assuming that by XML format, you mean XML DSig RSAKeyValue, and that by PEM format you mean what OpenSSL exports in between -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- and -----END PUBLIC KEY-----.
You need first to extract the modulus and public exponent from the XML.
   <RSAKeyValue>
     <Modulus>xA7SEU+e0yQH5rm9kbCDN9o3aPIo7HbP7tX6WOocLZAtNfyxSZDU16ksL6W

     </Modulus>
     <Exponent>AQAB</Exponent>
   </RSAKeyValue>

You can easily convert these into a bit string using base64_decode.
Once this is done, you need to build the ASN.1 public key structure somehow.
What OpenSSL exports between BEGIN/END PUBLIC KEY is an X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure.
SubjectPublicKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
   algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
   subjectPublicKey BIT STRING }

The subjectPublicKey is made of a sequnce is described in the PKCS#1 spec:
RSAPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
   modulus INTEGER,
   publicExponent INTEGER
}

The algorithm (an AlgorithmIdentifier) is also described in the PKCS#1 spec (see section A.1):
rsaEncryption
OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { pkcs-1 1 }

This structure needs to be serialized in DER form, then base64-encoded and then placed between the BEGIN/END delimiters.
I don't know of any PHP library to do the ASN.1/DER encoding unfortunately (the rest is relatively easy, but dealing with ASN.1 tends to be tedious).
The PHP/PEAR Crypt_RSA module can construct RSA public keys from modulus and exponent, but its toString() method uses a custom format (just the base64-encoding of the result of PHP serialize on the array structure, which has nothing to do with the ASN.1/DER encoding).

 `ssh-keygen -t rsa` 

It seems to go perfectly. I have it on my C:/Users/***/.ssh folder. I now try to clone an app i forked in GitHub. When I try to clone it on the rails_apps directory, I get a message saying
 Permission Denied(public key). 

I found a solution on the net saying that I should run this first:
`ssh-add` 

So I tried doing that. But it said that:
Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.
Then after some googling I find something about executing the ssh-agent. So I do this:
`ssh-agent bash`

and the command line changes from my rails_apps directory to this:
`bash3.1$>`

So I run:
`bash3.1$>ssh-add [path to .ssh folder]`

and it successfully adds the rsa private key(it doesn't work with id-rsa.pub). I have also pasted the newly generated public key to my GitHub account. 
Now when I try to clone:
`bash3.1$>git clone git@github.com:username/myrepo.git`

It now successfully clones the repo I forked in GitHub. Now that I have the app in my local repo, I try to create a heroku app.
`bash3.1$>cd myrepo`  
`bash3.1$>heroku create myapp`

And this code runs successfully. Git remote added successfully. Now all I have to do is to push it.
`bash3.1$>git push heroku master`

BAM! I get the error message again. 
Permission denied (public key)
I am so close into pushing my app to heroku. But it just won't work. Can you help me. What am I doing wrong here? Thanks! :D
","Note: your ticket on GitHub Support prompted the answer:

You need to give heroku your key. There should be a command to do it. If you can't find it, you'll have to contact their support.

For that, see Graeme Collins's answer (and also Heroku error: "Permission denied (public key)" ):
heroku keys:add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

See Heroku devcenter for more on that process.
You can then see a list of all keys, including the key’s name, like this:
heroku keys

Note: that suppose you didn't use sudo to generate your keys, as "" git clone heroku ssh permission denied "" illustrates (where heroku keys:add doesn't work)

More information about your ssh keys in your other GitHub Support ticket.
debug1: Trying private key: /.ssh/identity
debug1: Trying private key: /.ssh/id_rsa
debug1: Trying private key: /.ssh/id_dsa


I'm not sure why it would be looking at /.ssh and not ~/.ssh then.
  Try moving your keypair over to that path.


Shouldn't that be:
 git push origin master

? By default, a reference to the cloned repo is called 'origin', not 'heroku'
What does
git remote -v show

display?  
It you want, you can reference the distant repo by the heroku name
git remote add heroku git@github.com:git_username/projectname.git

","You can login first in heroku providing Enail and Password and can follow the following steps to add a local git repository into a heroku application instance.

Issue this command at the Git Bash $ ssh-keygen -t rsa (default location and with empty passphrase. You can alternatives too).
Again issue at the bash $ heroku keys:add (It will automatically add the public key from the default location).
Issu this at the bash to check keys. $ heroku keys .
You can add the remote for you app name $ heroku git:remote -a app_name

","AFAIK X509 encoded keys are binary files encoded using ASN.1. Therefore the question on new-lines at the end does not make any sense. 
If you have a text file you have a PEM encoded file and I am currently not sure which KeySpec you have to use in this case. 
You may convert the PEM encoded key to a DER encoded key (e.g. using OpenSSL) or you can use BouncyCastle which as support for loading PEM encoded keys. 
BTW: Using keyfis.read(encKey); is dangerous as the read method only reads up encKey bytes but don't have to. Better create a DataInputStream from the InputStream and use readFully(encKey):
new DataInputStream(keyfis).readFully(encKey);

","Found the solution but not sure yet if its the right solution coz I still have to get the PrivateKey and decrypt the file but for now I was able to encrypt it using the supplied PublicKey as the modulus but I don’t have the exponent and I just used some common number “65537” as the exponent
Which I read that it is not a critical part of the encryption.
I had to change the logic to use the RSAPublicKeySpec (which uses BigInteger and Base64Decoder)instead of X509EncodedKeySpec to set the KeySpec
And continue to use the KeyFactory object to generate the public key.
Now this logic NEEDS the modulus and exponent.
byte[] buffer = new byte[(int) new File(file).length()];
BufferedInputStream f = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(file));
f.read(buffer);
String modulusBase64 = new String(buffer);
BASE64Decoder b64dec = new BASE64Decoder();
String exponentBase64 = ""65537"";
RSAPublicKeySpec publicKeySpec = new RSAPublicKeySpec(new BigInteger    (1,                      b64dec.decodeBuffer(modulusBase64)), new BigInteger(1,     b64dec.decodeBuffer(exponentBase64)));
KeyFactory publicKeyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
publicKey = publicKeyFactory.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);

","The big gotcha, in my experience, is the ssh config file:
~/.ssh/config
This is where you tell SSH to align your user id with target URL and port.
Host gerrit.domain.com

I only ever have to do this every few years, so always forget this last step after all the keys are setup and it still doesn't work.

","It's been a long time since I asked this question, though due to the number of views, I would like to describe how I managed to make it worked.
By using the OpenSSL API, we can easily print the DER certificate in a pretty readable way. Even though its features are very limited, this is an example.
print OpenSSL.crypto.dump_certificate(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_TEXT,x509)

However, I wanted to have control over the keys in a var directly (it was needed to send it to other function), and in order to do that, I made the following function
def parse_asn1_der(derfile):
    from pyasn1_modules import  rfc2437,rfc2459
    from pyasn1.codec.der import decoder
    certType = rfc2459.Certificate(); 
    raw=derfile #the result of open(fname,""rb"").read()
    cert,rest = decoder.decode(raw, asn1Spec=certType)
    RSAKEYSDATA=frombits(cert.getComponentByName(""tbsCertificate"").getComponentByName(""subjectPublicKeyInfo"").getComponentByName(""subjectPublicKey""))
    SignatureCert=frombits(cert.getComponentByName(""signatureValue"")).encode(""hex"")
    rsaType=rfc2437.RSAPublicKey();
    rsadata,rsadata_rest = decoder.decode(RSAKEYSDATA, asn1Spec=rsaType)
    print ""----""
    print ""Certificate Plain Data""
    print ""RSA Modulus: %X"" %rsadata.getComponentByName(""modulus"")
    print ""RSA Public exponent: %X"" %rsadata.getComponentByName(""publicExponent"")

Hope it helps anyone looking around.

","The above answers are somewhat old (as of 2017).
You can use asn1crypto to do this in a nicer way:
from asn1crypto.x509 import Certificate

with open(""mycert.der"", ""rb"") as f:
    cert = Certificate.load(f.read())

n = cert.public_key.native[""public_key""][""modulus""]
e = cert.public_key.native[""public_key""][""public_exponent""]

print(""{:#x}"".format(n))    # prints the modulus (hexadecimal)
print(""{:#x}"".format(e))    # same, for the public exponent

It's relatively new (from what I can see, mid-2015), provides a nicer interface than the libraries already mentioned, and is much faster than pyasn1 according to the author.

","I see a couple issues here.  First, the actual signing code should be included with your question as well.  Without being able to see the signing code, it's more difficult to debug the problem.  Check if your signing algorithm is the same as your verification algorithm (SHA256withRSA).  
Next, if you're using the SHA256withRSA algorithm, you don't need to calculate a message digest first.  The algorithm will calculate it for you and sign the digest.  You just pass in the entire file to be signed.
In your verification step, you are updating the Signature object with the same file that you are saying is the signature.  Both files are Digital Signature Doctor.txt.  You should update the Signature object with the file to be signed, which I believe from your example is 2.jpg.  Then when you call the verify() method, pass in the signature bytes.
Finally, you are misinterpreting the return value of verify().  It returns a boolean.  It does not return the message digest or the original message.  When your code does String.valueOf(decryptmd2), the value will either be ""false"" or ""true"".
I'm not sure why you are trying to compare the message digests.  Let's say you are sent a message with a signature signed by a private key corresponding to a public key that you trust.  IF the verify() method returns true, you can be sure that:

the message was signed by that person
the message you received is identical to the message that was signed

That should be sufficient for what you need.

The following code is what I use to generate a public key using C#:
// Variables
CspParameters cspParams = null;
RSACryptoServiceProvider rsaProvider = null;
StreamWriter publicKeyFile = null;
string publicKey = """";

try
{
   // Create a new key pair on target CSP
   cspParams = new CspParameters();
   cspParams.ProviderType = 1; // PROV_RSA_FULL
   cspParams.Flags = CspProviderFlags.CreateEphemeralKey;
   rsaProvider = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(2048, cspParams);

   // Export public key
   result = ExportPublicKeyToPEMFormat(rsaProvider);
}
catch (Exception ex)

The ExportPublicKeyToPEMFormat can be found from this thread:

Obviously there is something different with the formats between the two public key.

","Unfortunately, the code in the answer you referenced isn't really correct - it exports a private key PEM format, but with only the public key fields correctly set, this is not the same as exporting an RSA public key in standard format.
I actually wrote the code in the other answer to that question, and at the time wrote a mode for exporting the public key in the standard format, but didn't include it in that answer as it wasn't required. Here it is:

"51228645","How can I encrypt with a RSA private key in python?","Is it possible to encrypt a message with a private key in python using pycryptodome or any other library? I know that you are not supposed to encrypt with the private key and decrypt with the public key, but my purpose is to encrypt with the private one so the receiver could be sure that the message was send by the real author. More than secure encryption I'm looking for some kind of obfuscation. I want to do an app where the message is public but it can only be seen if you have the public key.
I've tried to do this:
from Crypto import Random
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP

def generate_keys():
    modulus_lenght = 256 * 4

encoded = encrypt_private_key(message, private_key)
decoded = decrypt_public_key(encoded, public_key)

print decoded

But it raises the next error: TypeError: This is not a private key.
","Short answer

the code that you are using doesn't allow you to do that for security reasons
alternative code below

Long answer 
I was curious about your problem and then I started to try to code
After a while I realized that if you run this snippet you will see that it correctly works:
#!/usr/bin/env python

from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP
import base64

def generate_keys():
    modulus_length = 1024

    key = RSA.generate(modulus_length)
    #print (key.exportKey())

    pub_key = key.publickey()
    #print (pub_key.exportKey())

    return key, pub_key

def encrypt_private_key(a_message, private_key):
    encryptor = PKCS1_OAEP.new(private_key)
    encrypted_msg = encryptor.encrypt(a_message)
    print(encrypted_msg)
    encoded_encrypted_msg = base64.b64encode(encrypted_msg)
    print(encoded_encrypted_msg)
    return encoded_encrypted_msg

def decrypt_public_key(encoded_encrypted_msg, public_key):
    encryptor = PKCS1_OAEP.new(public_key)
    decoded_encrypted_msg = base64.b64decode(encoded_encrypted_msg)
    print(decoded_encrypted_msg)
    decoded_decrypted_msg = encryptor.decrypt(decoded_encrypted_msg)
    print(decoded_decrypted_msg)
    #return decoded_decrypted_msg

def main():
  private, public = generate_keys()
  print (private)
  message = b'Hello world'
  encoded = encrypt_private_key(message, public)
  decrypt_public_key(encoded, private)

if __name__== ""__main__"":
  main()

but if you now change two of the final lines [i.e. the role of the keys] into:
    encoded = encrypt_private_key(message, private)
    decrypt_public_key(encoded, public)

and rerun the program you will get the TypeError: No private key
Let me quote from this great answer: 
""As it turns out, PyCrypto is only trying to prevent you from mistaking one for the other here, OpenSSL or Ruby OpenSSL allow you for example to do both: public_encrypt/public_decrypt and private_encrypt/private_decrypt
[...]
Additional things need to be taken care of to make the result usable in practice. And that's why there is a dedicated signature package in PyCrypto - this effectively does what you described, but also additionally takes care of the things I mentioned""

Final notes: 

the last prints have ascii because as stated here ""In case of base64 however, all characters are valid ASCII characters""
in this case we are using the same key - the private one - both for encrypting and decrypting, so yes: we would end up to be symmetric but...
but - as stated here - ""The public key is PUBLIC - it's something you would readily share and thus would be easily disseminated. There's no added value in that case compared to using a symmetric cipher and a shared key"" plus ""Conceptually, ""encrypting"" with the private key is more useful for signing a message whereas the ""decryption"" using the public key is used for verifying the message""
the same identical last principle is expressed in this answer - ""Typically [...] we say sign with the private key and verify with the public key""

Edit
After being downvoted, here some more detail how I see it:
The OP provided this link: https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/PLINK/Picketlink+as+SP,+Salesforce+as+IDP?_sscc=t where it says:

After certificate will be generated in Salesforce, you can download it to your computer.

and

This certificate will be used to sign SAMLResponse messages sent from Salesforce IDP.
Type self-signed

after that, OP is told to import that cert, from which he would now like to retrieve the public key:

keytool -import -file salesforce_idp_cert.cer -keystore jbid_test_keystore.jks -alias salesforce-idp

So it seems obvious that

OP does not have the private key for that cert
There is no chain for this cert

So what am I doing wrong? What is the proper way of loading a public keys data from disk?

","Public and Private keys are encoded differently. Whilst private keys are encoded in PKCS #8, public keys are not. They are instead encoded in X.509 according to the ASN.1 specifications.
Description from the Key.getFormat() method:

Returns the name of the primary encoding format of this key, or null if this key does not support encoding. The primary encoding format is named in terms of the appropriate ASN.1 data format, if an ASN.1 specification for this key exists. For example, the name of the ASN.1 data format for public keys is SubjectPublicKeyInfo, as defined by the X.509 standard; in this case, the returned format is ""X.509"". Similarly, the name of the ASN.1 data format for private keys is PrivateKeyInfo, as defined by the PKCS #8 standard; in this case, the returned format is ""PKCS#8"".

According to this, instead of reading public keys as PKCS #8, you should read it as X.509.
Consider changing your public key reading code from:
PKCS8EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(data);

to:
X509EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(data);

To encrypt a message addressed to Alice in a hybrid cryptosystem, Bob does the following:

Obtains Alice's public key.
Generates a fresh symmetric key for the data encapsulation scheme.
Encrypts the message under the data encapsulation scheme, using the symmetric key just generated.
Encrypt the symmetric key under the key encapsulation scheme, using Alice's public key.
Send both of these encryptions to Alice.

To decrypt this hybrid ciphertext, Alice does the following:

uses her private key to decrypt the symmetric key contained in the key encapsulation segment.
uses this symmetric key to decrypt the message contained in the data encapsulation segment.

I am using RSA For a public-key cryptosystem, and AES for symmetric-key cryptosystem. Every thing works fine, but I am not sure how to handle AES initialization vector. Currently, I am concatenating the AES key and initialization vector encrypting it with the public key and sending that to server.
I just wanted to get some opinions about this approach. How this problem is solved by other communication protocols SSL etc.
Thanks.
","I've done the same thing, and I handled it the same way - concatenate the AES key with the IV and encrypt them both.
You could also just send the key and use the key itself to generate an IV - for example by using the first 128 bits of a hash of the key as the IV.  That should be OK security-wise as long as you are generating a new AES key for each session and not re-using the same AES key over and over with the same IV.

","There is no reason to encrypt the IV - you can send that in the clear.  Just make sure you pick a new one each time (the same way you do the AES key).
That said, it is often convenient to package the AES key and IV together.  Encryption of 16 bytes ain't that expensive.

","You don't encrypt the IV. Bundle it with the encrypted key and send it (in the clear) to the recipient.
Standards for this do exist. This scheme is called ""KeyTransRecipientInfo"" in CMS (upon which S/MIME is based), and PGP offers a similar mode. TLS also includes the initialization vector as a parameter in the key encryption algorithm identifier, using the same ASN.1 syntax as CMS. A robust, open-source library to perform this operation is available for many, many platforms.
At the very least, studying the CMS specification might help avoid some of the many pitfalls in a home-brew implementation. See §6.1 and §6.2.1 of RFC 3369.

","I ran into this issue, and it turned out that the Public Key Ring was actually the public key itself. When I was running the iterator I was actually getting subkeys (which turns into that message block instead of the public key block).  If I'm not explaining that well, check out this explanation.
Assuming realContact is a public key ring that only contains subkeys, you don't actually need to run it through getPublicKey().

","A host key fingerprint verification is a crucial step in securing your SSH connection. Even if you are using a set of sessions with your script, it does not excuse you. The fingerprint should be part of a set of information you have for each of the sessions (in addition to a hostname, an username and a password).
Skipping the fingerprint verification means that you lose any security and there's no point using an SSH/SFTP anymore.
Anyway, if you do not care about a security, you can use the -hostkey=* switch to unconditionally accept any host key.

","UPDATE - FIXED IT
restorecon -R -v -d /root/.ssh

This is a known issue with RH where directories get mislabelled and PAM prevends sshd from reading authorized_hosts when run as init script. You'll see the errors if you stumble across /var/log/audit/audit.log. Rare it seems but painful when it happens!
More details at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=499343
ORIGINAL POST
I've just hit what looks like exactly this problem. I had a poorly tuned VirtualBox (I hadn't told vbox to use 64bit) -- which when I cloned and restarted (in vbox RedHat 64-bit mode), started asking me for a password.
The original image was fine -- with identical settings -- so I think the suggestion of being networking-related might be relevant, or else to do with server keys.
The weird thing however is that if on the box, I kill the sshd process which autostarted, then manually run /usr/sbin/sshd as root, I can log in passwordless fine.  A silly workaround, but usable.
So it is an /etc/init.d/sshd issue.  But I haven't been able to track down what it is ... have tried chucking out most of the stuff in that script but it still prompts for password when invoked as /etc/init.d/sshd start but not when at /usr/sbin/sshd.
Maybe these comments can help, and someone can then help further!?

","I had the exact same problem and have been scratching my head for an entire afternoon.
It turned out to be a small sshd_config file issue.
first, change access mod on .ssh folder of the remote host to user access only. 
chmod 700 ~/.ssh

next, go to /etc/ssh/sshd_config, change StrictModes yes to StrictModes no. If it's commented out, then specifically add StrictModes no into the file.
That solved the issue.

","Let's say alice is a github.com user, with 2 or more private repositories repoN.
For this example we'll work with just two repositories named repo1 and repo2
https://github.com/alice/repo1
https://github.com/alice/repo2
You need to be to pull from these repositories without entering a passwords probably on a server, or on multiple servers.
You want to perform git pull origin master for example, and you want this to happen without asking for a password.
You don't like dealing with ssh-agent, you have discovered (or you're discovering now) about ~/.ssh/config a file that let's your ssh client know what private key to use depending on Hostname and username, with a simple configuration entry that looks like this:
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile /home/alice/.ssh/alice_github.id_rsa
  IdentitiesOnly yes

So you went ahead and created your (alice_github.id_rsa, alice_github.id_rsa.pub) keypair, you then also went to your repository's .git/config file and you modified the url of your remote origin to be something like this:
[remote ""origin""]
        url = ""ssh://git@github.com/alice/repo1.git""

And finally you went to the repository Settings > Deploy keys section and added the contents of alice_github.id_rsa.pub
At this point you could do your git pull origin master without entering a password without issue.
but what about the second repository?
So your instinct will be to grab that key and add it to repo2's Deploy keys, but github.com will error out and tell you that the key is already being used.
Now you go and generate another key (using ssh-keygen -t rsa -C ""alice@alice.com"" without passwords of course), and so that this doesn't become a mess, you will now name your keys like this:

repo1 keypair: (repo1.alice_github.id_rsa, repo1.alice_github.id_rsa.pub)
repo2 keypair: (repo2.alice_github.id_rsa, repo2.alice_github.id_rsa.pub)

You will now put the new public key on repo2's Deploy keys configuration at github.com, but now you have an ssh problem to deal with. 
How can ssh tell which key to use if the repositories are hosted on the same github.com domain?
Your .ssh/config file points to github.com and it doesn't know which key to use when it's time to do the pull.
So I found a trick with github.com. You can tell your ssh client that each repository lives in a different github.com subdomain, in these cases, they will be repo1.github.com and repo2.github.com
So first thing is editing the .git/config files on your repo clones, so they look like this instead:
For repo1
[remote ""origin""]
        url = ""ssh://git@repo1.github.com/alice/repo1.git""

For repo2
[remote ""origin""]
        url = ""ssh://git@repo2.github.com/alice/repo2.git""
And then, on your .ssh/config file, now you will be able to enter a configuration for each subdomain :)
Host repo1.github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile /home/alice/.ssh/repo1.alice_github.id_rsa
  IdentitiesOnly yes

Host repo2.github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile /home/alice/.ssh/repo2.alice_github.id_rsa
  IdentitiesOnly yes

Now you are able to git pull origin master without entering any passwords from both repositories.
If you have multiple machines, you could copy the keys to each of the machines and reuse them, but I'd advise doing the leg work to generate 1 key per machine and repo. You will have a lot more keys to handle, but you will be less vulnerable if one gets compromised.

First, you need to register your PuTTYgen-generated public key on the server. See Getting ready for public key authentication or (my) Set up SSH public key authentication.
And finally see Can we use JSch for SSH key-based communication? for details on using the private key in JSch.


Make sure you use the latest version of JSch, as older versions do not support the .ppk format natively.

FTP is working fine, but working with SFTP it requires host key.
When I worked with WinSCP application directly it warns for the host key and user is able to copy host key by clicking on ""Copy key"" button.
Host key will be copied to clipboard and we can use this key to download files from SFTP or SCP.
There is also an option that user can suppress the use of host key.
I want to suppress the use of host key programmatically.
Let me know if there required any other information.
","What do you mean by ""suppress the use of host key""?
There's no option to suppress use of the host key in WinSCP application. You have an option to accept the host key and remember it, to accept the key without remembering it, and to reject the key (and abandon the connection).
https://winscp.net/eng/docs/ssh_verifying_the_host_key
The WinSCP .NET assembly does not have the first option built-in, as it (by default) does not keep any configuration, so it cannot store the accepted keys anywhere. That's by design. It's your task to set the SessionOptions.SshHostKeyFingerprint. Either:

hard-code the host key fingerprint;
or load it from any configuration your application have (i.e. possibly from the same configuration you load host name or user name); 
or implement SSH host key cache (known hosts).


Your code does not show implementation of OpenSession, what is a key piece here, so it's not clear what you are trying to do.
If you do not care about the host key (meaning you do not care about security at all), you can make WinSCP accept any host key unconditionally using the SessionOption.GiveUpSecurityAndAcceptAnySshHostKey.
But that's for use in exceptional situations only, where SSH security is unnecessary overhead. Like when both your application and server are within an isolated network.
See also WinSCP .NET library: Connect to SFTP server without specifying SSH host key fingerprint.

","Be aware, that Get-PfxCertificate temporarily stores your private key at %ProgramData%\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys, where everyone could read it.
If that is not a desirable behavior, than you should probably use either import method or constructor of the X509Certificate2 .NET object with EphemeralKeySet as a key storage flag, which indicates that private key should be created in memory and not persisted on disk when importing a certificate, e.g.:
$Cert = New-Object -TypeName System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2
$FullPathToCert = Resolve-Path -Path .\cert.pfx
$Password = Read-Host 'Password' -AsSecureString
$X509KeyStorageFlag = 32
$Cert.Import($FullPathToCert, $Password, $X509KeyStorageFlag)
$Cert.GetPublicKey()

Notes

EphemeralKeySet flag supported by .NET Framework 4.7.2, .NET Core 2.0 and above;
$X509KeyStorageFlag = 32 is just a shorthand for the $X509KeyStorageFlag = [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509KeyStorageFlags]::EphemeralKeySet

And with this code i am trying to read this keys :
private PublicKey getPublicKey() throws UnsupportedEncodingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException{

    byte[] keyBytes = Base64.decodeBase64(SP.getString(""PublicKey"", ""default value"").getBytes(""utf-8""));
    X509EncodedKeySpec spec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(keyBytes);
    KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
    PublicKey key = keyFactory.generatePublic(spec);
    return key;}

But something goes wrong.It gives InvalidKeySpecException. I thing this cannot read the keys from file.How can i fix this problem? Thank you.
","Thanks for the accepted code above (maybe below). However, in my case, the 'getPrivatekey()' throws an InvalidKeySpecException. It says 'Unknown KeySpc type: java.secrity.spec.X509EncodedKeySpec'. The solution I used is to replace X509EncodedKeySpec with PKCS8EncodedKeySpec. Then it works!

","We built the overthere framework on top of SSHJ. Which can connect also connect using key files.
The following piece of code should work, but make sure you add the bouncycastle library to your classpath.
SSHClient client = new SSHClient();
String username = ""johndoe"";
File privateKey = new File(""~/.ssh/id_rsa"");
KeyProvider keys = client.loadKeys(privateKey.getPath());
client.authPublickey(username, keys);

Hope that helps.

Since the time I put it up, I've lost the private key of the pair.
I have generated a new key pair and put it on my github profile. But I still can't push to github. git gives me errors related to my keys.
I'd like to remove the old public key, but I can't seem to find the option to do so in githubs admin dashboards. I can't find any instructions for how to remove keys. I've emailed them for help, but haven't gotten a reply as of yet.
How can I remove existing keys in my github account?
","To remove an SSH public key, follow the below steps.

Login to your GitHub account.
Go to the account Settings.
Follow the link 'SSH keys' at /settings/ssh.
Note your key in a list, represented as an email address (or compare with ssh-add -l).
Simply click on the 'Delete' next to your key.

That should do it.

How to convert the keys generated by SecKeyGeneratePair to -----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY----- ................ -----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
format

","At first you need to obtain raw bitstreams (data) representing your key pair see how to do it here
What you need, is just base64 encoded string representing obtained data, with header and footer as is in your example which is generally known as PEM format
How? Check data.base64EncodedString()
Warning!!! Exporting private key is ... sorry for the words ... stupid idea

","There is a few options for you...
GEM SERVER
Install the gem on any server you want to distribute it from. Then run gem server on the machine. This will start up a small gem server that can be queried by anyone. Then just add the new gem source to the client machines. gem sources -a <server>. 

Pros: Extremely easy to setup. Can be launched on any port.
Cons: Doesn't offer key based authentication.

GITOSIS
Setup a gitosis server and store the gem source code on there. Then just pull from the repo and build the gem when you need to update it. Yes it is an extra couple of steps to build and install the gem, however you will get key based authentication for better security.

Pros: Offers key based authentication
Cons: Have to pull the source, build, then install the gem on each update. You also have to actually setup the gitosis server.

GITHUB
Exact same thing as gitosis, but you have to pay to make it private. This requires no setup if you can afford it.

Pros: Offers key based authentication
Cons: Have to pull the source, build, then install the gem on each update. Costs a little money.

Unfortunately, none of the major gem services do exactly what you need. Github stopped building gems, and RubyGems doesn't offer any private gem hosting. Hopefully one of the tools above will work well enough for you. Personally I would just go with the gem server option, then lock the machine down by IP, or some other access restriction. I know its not perfect, but it works and is quick/easy to setup.

","A public key by itself would let them decrypt any encrypted information sent out by the server. That's it. Going from public key to private key is exceptionally hard; that's how public key cryptography works. (By “exceptionally” I mean that it's designed to be resistant to well-funded government efforts; if it keeps the NSA from cracking you, it'll be sure good enough for stopping Joe Blow.)
Note that it doesn't help with DRM, which it sounds a bit like you're trying to do. DRM is just plain broken by design; if the attacker has the information and the key to unlock it in devices local to him, it's already game over. If you give a key to an attacker, it might as well be public since he's sure not going to be willing to keep it secret…

","The point is that this sort of encryption is designed to protect the content of the message and to verify sender authenticity which in this case is clearly known to the user i.e. Name and Vendor etc. Much nicer would be to protect a section of the code with this sort of encryption such that crucial bits of code stays garbled until the proper key is used.
Once the key is used however the user can decrypt and make copies of the software. Fully protected software is fully unusable. Though unrelated this is an interesting read regarding protecting things.

","Public keys are used everywhere -- logon forms, security of banking transactions, client-side authentication etc. So the short answer is that you shouldn't worry, cause lots of other, smarter people have looked at this problem and accepted the distribution of public keys to endpoints.
What can people tell from your public key? They would obviously know a key name and key length. I assume that the key is part of a certificate, which could also contain some details about your company and website URL.
My questions to you are:
1) Why are you worried about a public key in an executable? Any half-decent cracker would just change your executable to bypass the public key check altogether. The fact that the encryption is strong is meaningless when you're giving a binary to the client that can be modified.
2) Are you aware of the mess you may be getting yourself into? There's nothing inherently wrong with using public key encryption to secure a binary, but you may end up with problems as the system develops. Things such as expired keys, key roll-overs and key issuance (I believe this is a tool you're developing to sell) can become a major pain. And, yet, you'll still be stuck with the reality that your bigger challenge is stopping crackers from just rerouting the binary to avoid your security check altogether.

Once the user manually enters their name and license into the shareware application it is verified by the public key embedded in the application to be a valid or invalid license.
However, it would be fairly trivial for a determined person with the right ""know-how"" to disassemble the executable and retrieve the public key.
My question here is, what could they do with it? Is a public key, by itself, completely innocuous? Is the public key enough information to reverse engineer a key generator?
Curious minds want to know. Thanks in advance!
","I disagree that the public key is not useful. I generate my own public and private key pair and let us assume that I find the bits of the public key in the executable. I change the the public key to my public key. Now I can sign anything with my private key, the program will accept it.

If you are talking about the key to verify apps on install : you can use any key to sign an app and install it via adb. But, you will have to use the same key to re-install an app. In that case, keys are not checked against a global repo like with Google Play, they are just checked locally.
For testing, things are a bit different, I believe it's due to interaction of instrumentation runner and the code under test, they have to be run in the same process so, if you install an app's test package with a debug certificate, then you can't install the app using a release certificate, either you install the app with debug certificate as well, or you uninstall the tests.

Some parts of the link will resolve your question
Embed your public key for licensing
For each application, the Google Play service automatically generates a 2048-bit RSA public/private key pair that is used for licensing and in-app billing. The key pair is uniquely associated with the application. Although associated with the application, the key pair is not the same as the key that you use to sign your applications (or derived from it).
The Google Play Developer Console exposes the public key for licensing to any developer signed in to the Developer Console, but it keeps the private key hidden from all users in a secure location. When an application requests a license check for an application published in your account, the licensing server signs the license response using the private key of your application's key pair. When the LVL receives the response, it uses the public key provided by the application to verify the signature of the license response.
To add licensing to an application, you must obtain your application's public key for licensing and copy it into your application. Here's how to find your application's public key for licensing:
Go to the Google Play Developer Console and sign in. Make sure that you sign in to the account from which the application you are licensing is published (or will be published).
In the application details page, locate the Services & APIs link and click it.
In the Services & APIs page, locate the Licensing & In-App Billing section. Your public key for licensing is given in the Your License Key For This Application field.
To add the public key to your application, simply copy/paste the key string from the field into your application as the value of the String variable BASE64_PUBLIC_KEY. When you are copying, make sure that you have selected the entire key string, without omitting any characters.
Here's an example from the LVL sample application:
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
    private static final String BASE64_PUBLIC_KEY = ""MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG ... ""; //truncated for this example
...
}

","An embedded key can be replaced. Generally speaking, if the client's machine is not secured by non-software means, you cannot prevent hacking of your client by a sufficiently motivated attacker. Even a TPM is no panacea. The question becomes one of trade-off: attackers' man-hours vs. utility (profit, fame &c) gained. The only really secure way to license a program which does computations is to perform all licensable computations on a server you physically control; https or SSL can be made sufficiently secure by choosing appropriate key lengths, hashing schemes, ciphers &c (a subject of which I know little).
The principle here is actually rather simple: you need to engineer a situation in which it will be in your clients' best interests to protect their passwords/license keys/data/whatever. E.g. if you have a computation server and charge your clients for server time, client keys are proxies to owners' bank accounts.

","Well private key algorithms usually offers better performances (by an order of magnitude or more as far as I can remember) then their public key counterpart. In that sense Diffie-Hellman would be more efficient then say RSA for a client-server architecture.
If you have far far more clients then servers, you could implement a public-key algorithm to reduce the exchanges between them.
Still, like many people said, you should consider asking/hiring an expert on the matter as there is many different types of attacks (most of them targeting only the implementation and not the algorithm per se). If you still want to proceed, I can only wish you best of luck and point you to this resources you should very carefully read.

The C# code takes some string content, and a signature (generated using the private key, on a seperate machine) and combined with the public key it verifies the signature matches, providing a level of assurance that the request has not been tampered with.
  public bool VerifySignature(string content, byte[] signatureBytes, AsymmetricAlgorithm publicKey)
  {
        var hash = new MD5CryptoServiceProvider();

        byte[] dataBuffer = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(content);

        deformatter.SetHashAlgorithm(""MD5"");

        return deformatter.VerifySignature(hash, signatureBytes);

The public key itself is an X509 Certificate - constructed from a .cer file, stored as assembly resource i.e.
byte[] data; // data is read from a resource stream.
var publicKey = new X509Certificate2(data, """", X509KeyStorageFlags.MachineKeySet).PublicKey.Key

What I'm looking to do is emulate this functionality in Java, so I can verify the signature generated by some code in C#... I've started investigating the crypto functionality of Java, but I'm a bit of a java noob.  Here's what I've come up with so far:
byte[] certContents=null;
byte[] signature=null;
String contents = ""abc"";

// load cert
CertificateFactory factory = CertificateFactory.getInstance(""X.509"");
X509Certificate cert = (X509Certificate) factory.generateCertificate(new ByteArrayInputStream(certContents));

// grab public key
RSAPublicKey publicKey = (RSAPublicKey)cert.getPublicKey();

// get sha1 hash for contents        
Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA1"");
mac.update(contents.getBytes());                
byte[] hash = mac.doFinal();

// get cipher
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");
cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, publicKey);

// verify signature of contents matches signature passed to method somehow (and this is where I'm stuck)

Can anyone provide any insight into how I can verify the signature - or provide links to some resources which might explain the java.crypto and java.security.cert usage better then the run of the mill java docs.
","That C# code looks really confusing to me. It use SHA1CryptoServiceProvider but uses MD5 hash so I can't tell which hashing algorithm it's using. I assume it's MD5.
The signature verification process involves padding so your code wouldn't work. Following is some snippet from my code and you can use it to verify the signature. data is the bytes to sign and sigBytes holds the signature.
String algorithm = ""MD5withRSA"";

// Initialize JCE provider    
Signature verifier = Signature.getInstance(algorithm);

// Do the verification   
boolean result=false;

For this, I want to decrypt the signature value (the signed digest) of the message with the public key that belongs to the private key the digest was signed with in the first place. 
I have the following items: 

The digest value in base64 of the message (calculated with SHA256)
The signature value on the digest in base64 that has been signed with the private

The public key in .pem format belonging to the private key
I have the actual message (it is in XML containing multiple signatures on different sections of the document). I already verified the signatures using the XML security library. I'm interested in only decrypting the signature value with the public key.

I'm kind of stuck of how I can achieve this using openssl. 
I'm trying variations on the commands described here and here, however I'm kind of lost. 
I suppose I should convert the signature from base64 value to octet using:
base64 --d sigfile > sigfile_octet?
Then I'm using the command:
openssl rsautl -inkey pubkey.pem -pubin -in sigfile_octet
Does this give me the decrypted signature value in octet? 
What are the next steps I need to perform to compare it with the base64 digest? 
p.s. I already verified the signature using Aleksey's XML security library, so I know the digest should match the decrypted signature value.
Your help would be very much appreciated!!
Kind regards,
Diederik
","Use the dgst command, not rsautl:
openssl dgst -verify pubkey.pem -signature sigfile_octet message.txt

Here, message.txt is the message that you are trying to verify.

You can use rsautl to ""decrypt"" the signature, getting access to the raw verification data:
openssl rsautl -verify -inkey pubkey.pem -pubin -in sigfile_octet

This will yield the signature's DER-encoded ASN.1 structure. That's a sequence containing the algorithm identifier of the hash algorithm that was used, followed by the hash itself. If you want OpenSSL to print human-readable view of this structure, you can add the -asn1parse option to the the rsautl command. That looks something like this: 

    0:d=0  hl=2 l=  49 cons: SEQUENCE          
    2:d=1  hl=2 l=  13 cons:  SEQUENCE          
    4:d=2  hl=2 l=   9 prim:   OBJECT            :sha256
   15:d=2  hl=2 l=   0 prim:   NULL              
   17:d=1  hl=2 l=  32 prim:  OCTET STRING      
      0000 - c9 8c 24 b6 77 ef f4 48-60 af ea 6f 49 3b ba ec   ..$.w..H`..oI;..
      0010 - 5b b1 c4 cb b2 09 c6 fc-2b bb 47 f6 6f f2 ad 31   [.......+.G.o..1

If you want to extract just the hash, instead of using the -asn1parse option, you can pipe it to the asn1parse command, which gives you the ability to extract elements from the structure.
When you say that you have ""the signature value on the digest"", I assume that what you have is a real signature with this structure, and not just the raw hash, which was signed with the private key. If that's not the case, you can post some example output.

"4299795","Why public key algorithms are slow?","I'm studying for a test and I'm still didn't get it why public key algorithms are way slower than symetric algorithms. 
","Encryption and keying methods are a very deep and complex topic that only the smartest mathematical minds in the world can fully understand, but there are top-level views that most people can understand.
The primary difference is that symmetric algorithms require a much, much smaller key than asymmetric (PKI) methods. Because symmetric algorithms work on a ""shared secret"" (such as abcd1234) which is transferred inside a trusted communication method (for example, I'm going to call you on the telephone and ask you for the shared secret) then they don't need to be as long as they rely on other methods of security (i.e. I trust you not to tell that to anyone).
PK infrastructure involves sending that ""key"" over the internet, over un-trusted space, and involves using huge prime numbers and massive keys (1024-bit or 2048-bit rather than 128 or 256-bit for example).
A general rule of thumb is that PKI methods are approximately 1,000 times slower than a symmetric key.

"4299795","Why public key algorithms are slow?","I'm studying for a test and I'm still didn't get it why public key algorithms are way slower than symetric algorithms. 
","Public-key cryptography is a form of asymmetric cryptography, in which the difference is the use of an extra cryptographic key.
Symmetric algorithms use a ""shared secret"" in which two systems each use a single cryptographic key to encrypt and decrypt communications.
Public-key cryptography does not use a single shared key, instead it uses mathematical key-pairs: a public and private key.  In this system the communications are encrypted with the public key and is decrypted with the private key.  Here is a better explanation from Wikipedia:

The distinguishing technique used in
  public key cryptography is the use of
  asymmetric key algorithms, where the
  key used to encrypt a message is not
  the same as the key used to decrypt
  it. Each user has a pair of
  cryptographic keys—a public encryption
  key and a private decryption key. The
  publicly available encrypting-key is
  widely distributed, while the private
  decrypting-key is known only to the
  recipient. Messages are encrypted with
  the recipient's public key and can
  only be decrypted with the
  corresponding private key. The keys
  are related mathematically, but the
  private key cannot feasibly (ie. in
  actual or projected practice) be
  derived from the public key. The
  discovery of algorithms that could
  produce public/private key pairs
  revolutionized the practice of
  cryptography beginning in the middle
  1970s.

The computational overhead is then quite obvious:  the public key is available to any system it's exposed to (a public-key system on the internet, for example exposes the public-key to the entire internet).  To compensate, both public and private keys will have to be quite large to ensure a stronger level of encryption.  The result, however, is a much stronger level of encryption, as the private decryption key (so far) cannot be reverse-engineered from the public encryption key.
There is more that can affect the ""speed"" of a public-key infrastructure (PKI).  Since one of the issues with this system is trust, most implementations involve a certificate authority (CA), which are entities that are trusted to delegate key pairs and validate the keys' ""identity"".
So to summarize:  larger cryptographic key sizes, two cryptographic keys instead of one, and with the introduction of a certificate authority: extra DNS look-ups, and server response times.
It's because of this extra overhead that most implementations benefit from a hybrid algorithm, where the public and private keys are used to generate a session key (much like a shared secret in symmetrical algorithms) to gain the best of both worlds.

"4299795","Why public key algorithms are slow?","I'm studying for a test and I'm still didn't get it why public key algorithms are way slower than symetric algorithms. 
","Public key algorithms rely on ""trapdoor"" calculations, ones that are computationally expensive to encrypt and computationally intractable to decrypt with the secret key.  If the first step is too easy (which correlates with speed), the second step becomes less hard (more breakable).  Consequently, public key algorithms tend to be resource intensive.
Private key algorithms already have the secret during the encryption phase, so they don't have to do as much work as an algorithm with a public secret.
The above is an over-generalization but should give you a feel for the reasons behind the relative speed differences.  That being said, a private key algorithm can be slow and a public key algorithm may have an efficient implementation.  The devil is in the details :-)

You are confusing the SSH server public host key verification with the client public key authentication. These are two completely different things. This first involves the public key of the server, while the latter involves your account public key.
Read about SSH Key Pairs to learn the difference.
FileZilla cannot connect without verifying the server's public host key either. On the first connection it always prompts you to accept the key. Once you do, it optionally caches the key and won't prompt you again, unless the key changes.

You have probably forgotten that you got this prompt before or someone else connected to the server before from your machine.
Any SSH (SFTP) client must do the same. You are losing any security had you not verified your server's host key.
You should get the host key fingerprint from your server administrator.
If you had not, you can see it on WinSCP Server and Protocol information dialog.
For details see WinSCP FAQ Where do I get SSH host key fingerprint to authorize the server?

Next thing is that if you do store sensitive data, you want to store it encrypted in the database to protect against accidental media loss. The best solution, by far, is to use Transparent Database Encryption. 
Neither of these solutions require any single line of code change in your application. They are both deployment time, administrator controlled settings. Trying to roll your own solution for cryptography will get you nowhere fast. It is extremely easy to screw up royally in cryptography, and you won't even know it.

","You don't generate prime numbers exactly. You generate a large odd number randomly, then test if that number is prime, if not generate another one randomly.  There are some laws of prime numbers that basically state that your odds of ""hitting"" a prime via random tries is (2/ln n) 
For example, if you want a 512-bit random prime number, you will find one in 2/(512*ln(2))
So roughly 1 out of every 177 of the numbers you try will be prime.  
There are multiple ways to test if a number is prime, one good one is the ""Miller-Rabin test"" as stated in another answer to this question. 
Also, OpenSSL has a nice utility to test for primes:

"31685734","Convert a X509 Public key to RSA public key","I have a public key in the following format

-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
xxxxxxxx
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

I need to convert this into the following format

-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
xxxxxxxxx
-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----

Basically, the issue is that I am working with a third party library which is written in Java.

The third party library uses Java class ""RSAPublicKeySpec"" to generate an instance of type RSAPublicKey from a String. 
The String that I am supplying to this third party library is taken from a file which is in the following format:


-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
xxxxxxxx
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----


After poking around with the code a bit, I could see that if I use the java class ""X509EncodedKeySpec"" to load this public key, the signature verification portion of my code works perfectly. However, since the code is a third-party library, I don't have an option of changing the class type in their code. I would need to somehow make sure that the input I am supplying to the library is compatible with ""RSAPublicKeySpec"" class so that the public key is loaded correctly.

","The ""RSA PUBLIC KEY"" format was used in very early SSLeay, which evolved into OpenSSL, but obsoleted before 2000 I believe, which was very early days for Java and I think before Java had any crypto even the restricted kind then allowed for export from the US. In short, the ""RSA PUBLIC KEY"" format is the RSA-specific format from PKCS#1, whereas ""PUBLIC KEY"" is the X.509 generic structure that handles numerous (and extensible) algorithm. So it would be interesting to know how the developers of your Java library got themselves into this bizarre limitation. But anyway ...
Although this format is long obsolete, OpenSSL still supports it. If you have the openssl commandline available (could be on another system which you copy the file/data to and back) just do:
openssl rsa -in publickey.pem -out rsapublickey.pem -pubin -RSAPublicKey_out 

Argh! having written the below, now I notice the (more general) dupe at Generating RSA keys in PKCS#1 format in Java
(plus several links onward from there) if you use BouncyCastle in Java (or OpenSSL library in C, but you already have the OpenSSL commandline option above).
Anyway, here is an outline of two ways to code in plain Java if you prefer that:
0) Both of them start by converting the input PEM to bytes. Read the ""----BEGIN"" line and preferably check it's correct; read all following lines (of base64) up to but not including the ""-----END"" line; concatenate and decode the base64 to bytes. Java8 provides java.util.Base64; before that you had to fiddle with ""internal"" classes or add one of several common (but not builtin) libraries like commons-codecs or write it yourself (which isn't that hard). Now choose either step 1 or step 2.
1) Parse those bytes as the ASN.1 DER encoding of an X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo as shown in RFC 5280 including the AlgorithmIdentifier. To be exact: skip the tag and length of the outer sequence; skip the tag, length and contents of the AlgorithmIdentifier -- or better extract the contents and check it is a SEQUENCE of an OID for rsaEncryption and NULL (or possibly omitted) params; then skip the tag and length and first byte (unused-bits) for the BIT STRING and take the (remaining) contents as the encoded key -- which is already the PKCS#1 RSAPublicKey structure you want. Proceed to step 3.
2) Or use standard JCE to read the X.509 format key: wrap the bytes in an X509EncodedKeySpec, give it to .generatePublic() of a KeyFactory for RSA, and cast the result to RSAPublicKey. Then call .getModulus() and .getPublicExponent() to get the mathematical values and encode them in ASN.1 DER with the structure RSAPublicKey defined in PKCS#1 rfc3447 (used for PKIX/X.509 in rfc3279 2.2.1). BigInteger.toByteArray() gives exactly the big-endian signed two's-complement form that ASN.1 wants, so this consists of:
get both .toByteArray() values, add tag=INTEGER (0x02) and length prefixes to each one, then add a tag=SEQUENCE-composite (0x30) and length prefix to their concatenation. Then proceed to step 3.
3) Now you have the bytes constituting a PKCS#1 RSAPublicKey, convert to PEM: encode to base64; break into lines (at 64 chars) if needed, or always to be safe; and add ""BEGIN"" and ""END"" lines, unless not needed.

","Actually, if you use RSA properly, then you cannot even guess your 'XXX' by trying the 1000 possibilities. The core operation in RSA is a modular exponentiation, but there is a first step called padding which transforms the data to encrypt into a big integer (modulo n).
The PKCS#1 RSA standard specifies two types of padding; both include a bunch of random bytes. A consequence is the following: if you encrypt twice the same message with the same key, you will get two distinct encrypted messages. The point is, precisely, to avoid the situation which you allude to: being able to ""guess"" the encrypted message and verify whether the guess is right or not, with only the public key (which is public, hence assumed to be known by every attacker).
Therefore, to answer your question: if you can find your 'XXX', either by trying only 1000 RSA encryption, or through any kind of clever shortcut, then your RSA is very wrong.

I have a .pem file (base64-encoded cryptography information). What OpenSSL command-line should I use to detect whether it contains a public key or a private key?

In general, you have to inspect the the first line of the PEM file to determine what is present.
OpenSSL can detect a subset of available encoded things (for lack of a better term). You can see the list of what OpenSSL can decode by examining <openssl src>/crypto/pem/pem.h. From the file:
#define PEM_STRING_X509_OLD ""X509 CERTIFICATE""
#define PEM_STRING_X509     ""CERTIFICATE""
#define PEM_STRING_X509_PAIR    ""CERTIFICATE PAIR""
#define PEM_STRING_X509_TRUSTED ""TRUSTED CERTIFICATE""
#define PEM_STRING_X509_REQ_OLD ""NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST""
#define PEM_STRING_X509_REQ ""CERTIFICATE REQUEST""

#define PEM_STRING_PARAMETERS   ""PARAMETERS""
#define PEM_STRING_CMS      ""CMS""

Some things will be more difficult than others. For example, its obvious what a RSA PUBLIC KEY is, but its not so obvious what a PUBLIC KEY is. In this case, you do one of two things. First, you ASN.1/DER decode the thing and then look ups its OID if available. Second, you try and load into a data structure that you expect the thing to be.
As an example of the second strategy, you would attempt to load a PEM blob into a RSA private key with PEM_read_bio_RSAPrivateKey. If it succeeds, then its a RSA private key. If its fails, then it may be a damaged RSA private key, or it may be an EC private key, or it may not be a PEM blob.

In 2006, a request was made to standardize the names of the things with the PKIX working group. It fell on deaf ears within the IETF. See PEM file format rfc draft request.

This is what I plan to do:-

While signing up, user's public key is saved in the website.
When the user tries to login later, the website asks the user for his corresponding private key.
User is authenticated if the private key matches the public key which the user provided while signing up.

I have seen sites like startssl.com asking for user's private key to verify their identity (see the screenshot attached). So what does it takes to implement such a system?

","Just to clarify the flow

The user signs up, using the plain old username and password pair. He is also asked to enter at least one public key (other ones can be added later from a profile administration panel)
The server stores the user's public key and associates it with its user in a certificate
Next time the client makes a request presenting his certificate (this should be handled by the browser, thus happening transparently to the user), the SSL engine on the server side checks if it knows the client and if it does the request is processed and the application code will authenticate and authorize the user since it knows the link between a public key and an user. If the client is not identified, the server should redirect to some page to allow signin up or manual login (maybe to add a new public key)

For the publickey authentication issue, the SFTPLog you configured should have more clues as to what might be the issue.  Perhaps the configured file does not exist, or does not have the necessary permissions?  Keep in mind that ~/.ssh/authorized_keys is often used by OpenSSH, and that the format that file is different that what ProFTPD desires.  For that reason, I often use:
SFTPAuthorizedUserKeys file:~/.sftp/authorized_keys

i.e. a different file from what OpenSSH wants, in a different format (RFC 4716), to avoid any possible confusion/collision.
Hope this helps!

"30945722","Converting byte array to publickey ECDSA","I need to use ECDSA algorithm to sign a message and send to receiver in java. Then, receiver should verify sender's signature.
So, for this, receiver has sender's public key but in byte array format after converting java.security.PublicKey to byte array by the command bellow:
byte[] byteArrayPublicKey = publickey.getEncoded();

The format of public key in ECDSA algorithm (before converting it to byte array) is as follow:
Public Key:
X: 8a83c389e7bb817c17bf2db4ed71055f18342b630221b2a3a1ca752502dc2e21

Y: 3eaf48c9ab1700fe0966a0cde196b85af66bb8f0bacef711c9dca2368f9d8470

But, the problem is to convert this byte array to usable format to verify the signature that is java.security.PublicKey by receiver. 
In general, is there any solution to verify the signature without converting it to byte array? In the other word, the problem is to verify the signature by sender's public key, using any method.
","
But, the problem is to convert this byte array to usable format to verify the signature that is java.security.PublicKey by receiver.

You can solve the problem like this way:
public static ECPublicKey genEcPubKey() throws Exception {
    KeyFactory factory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""ECDSA"", ""BC"");
    java.security.PublicKey ecPublicKey = (ECPublicKey) factory
            .generatePublic(new X509EncodedKeySpec(Helper
                    .toByte(ecRemotePubKey))); // Helper.toByte(ecRemotePubKey)) is java.security.PublicKey#getEncoded()
    return (ECPublicKey) ecPublicKey;
}

Note that, you need BouncyCastle provider to do that.
But question remains, how you generate the private key?
public KeyPair ecKeyPairGenerator(String curveName) throws Exception {
    KeyPair keyPair;
    KeyPairGenerator keyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(
            ""ECDSA"", ""BC"");
    ECGenParameterSpec ecGenParameterSpec = new ECGenParameterSpec(
            curveName);
    keyPairGenerator.initialize(ecGenParameterSpec, new SecureRandom());
    keyPair = keyPairGenerator.generateKeyPair();
    java.security.PublicKey ecPublicKey = (ECPublicKey) keyPair.getPublic();
    System.out.println(""JAVA EC PublicKey: ""
            + Helper.toHex(ecPublicKey.getEncoded()));

    // write private key into a file. Just for testing purpose
    FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(
            ""ECPrivateKey.key"");
    ObjectOutputStream objectOutputStream = new ObjectOutputStream(
            fileOutputStream);
    objectOutputStream.writeObject(keyPair.getPrivate());
    objectOutputStream.close();
    return keyPair;
}

","Diffie-Hellman key agreement provides a way of establishing a common secret key which is virtually impossible to determine by passive adversaries, i.e. people who only listen to the communications. 
However, basic D-H is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. In other words, you can establish a shared secret key, but in the presence of active adversaries you don't know with whom you share the key. 
That's where the public key cryptography has its place. When you have a genuine public key of someone, you can be sure that the encrypted data can be read only by that person. 
Making sure that a given public key really belongs to someone is a separate issue and is solved e.g. by Public Key Infrastructure.

","Symmetric and asymmetric ciphers are two completely different things. You cannot directly compare them.
Symmetric ciphers are used to encrypt a message with a shared secret. These are algorithms such as DES, AES, blowfish, etc.
Asymmetric ciphers deal with an other issue, namely key-sharing and signatures. By being able to have a public key, it is possible to distribute that key through a channel that cannot be modified. Others can read the key; as long as they cannot alter it there is no problem.
If others can alter the messages (this is usually the case anywhere) then it becomes more complicated. Then you need to use digital signatures. There is basically a central authority who signs public keys (certificates are also public keys). Everybody has the public keys of the certificate authority pre-installed (usually bundled with the OS) and therefore can verify that certificates are authentic by checking the signature using the authority's public key. This is referred to as a PKI (public key infrastructure) and it is used all over the place. Most prominent example is SSL.
Read up on it.

","As Krystian says, Diffie-Hellman lets you establish a secure connection, but doesn't let you verify who that secure connection is with.
However, DH can be used in combination with a public key algorithm like RSA.  This allows you to verify the other party's identity (using an RSA signature), and the Diffie-Hellman key exchange brings to the party a property called perfect forward secrecy.  This means that if you and I talk today, and next year somebody steals your RSA private key, they still can't go back and decrypt today's conversation.  A plain RSA key exchange doesn't have this property.

import paramiko

my_key = """"""\

pkey = paramiko.RSAKey.from_private_key(StringIO.StringIO(my_key))

ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
ssh.connect(hostname='host', username='user', pkey=pkey)

","You can store in Blob, you can read the public key file and get java public key object. You can directly store this publickey object in database as blob. First do :
 byte [] bytes = publicKey.getEncoded();

then store bytes in database.
For retrieving public key do as:
public PublicKey blobToPublicKey(final byte[] blob) 
    {
        Object result = null;
        final ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(blob);
        ObjectInputStream ois;

I want to read the public key into a byte array in C...

Well, the key on disk is likely PEM encoded. Because its a public key, it probably has the pre- and post- encapsulated boundaries of -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- and -----END PUBLIC KEY-----. You can read it like that using standard library functions.
You can also read the public key with PEM_read_PUBKEY. The function returns a EVP_PKEY*. I believe you can convert the EVP_PKEY* to a EC_KEY* with:
EC_KEY* ecKey = EVP_PKEY_get1_EC_KEY(pKey);

The get1 above means the reference count on the key was bumped (as opposed to get0). Be sure to call EC_KEY_free when done with it.
I'm not sure how you would read the public key into an array given a EVP_PKEY* or EC_KEY*. At minimum, there are two pieces of information: the curve (like secp256k1) and the public element (a point on the curve, which consists of an (x,y) coordinate). If the named curve (i.e., the OID) is not present (i.e., the absence of the OPENSSL_EC_NAMED_CURVE flag), then you have all the domain parameters like p, a, b, G, etc. Perhaps you should look at an ASN.1/DER encoding. I think that's the closet you are going to get.

keytool -export -alias mycertalias -keystore mykeystore.jks -rfc -file mypublickey.pem 

I obtain the public key and generate a string with BouncyCastle, but the obtained result doesn't match what I obtain with the command above. Here is my code: 
KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""pkcs12"");
keyStore.load(new FileInputStream(certPath),certPassword.toCharArray());
String alias = ""mycertalias"";
Certificate cert = keyStore.getCertificate(alias);

PublicKey publicKey = cert.getPublicKey();

PemWriter pemWriter = new PemWriter(writer);
pemWriter.writeObject(new PemObject(""CERTIFICATE"", publicKey.getEncoded()));
pemWriter.flush();
pemWriter.close();

System.out.println(writer.toString());

I have tried not using BouncyCastle and directly encoding the string, but I get the same result than before (so it doesn't match either with the result obtained with the keytool command):
Certificate cert = keyStore.getCertificate(alias);
BASE64Encoder encoder = new BASE64Encoder();
PublicKey publicKey = cert.getPublicKey();
System.out.println(new String(encoder.encode(publicKey.getEncoded())));

Any idea of what am I doing wrong? Thanks for the help in advance.
UPDATE:
As suggested by @dave_thompson_085 what I actually want is to export the whole certificate in PEM format, so the valid code is like this:
//...
Certificate cert = keyStore.getCertificate(alias);
StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
PemWriter pemWriter = new PemWriter(writer);
pemWriter.writeObject(new PemObject(""CERTIFICATE"", cert.getEncoded()));
//...

Thanks!
","Your keytool example does a JKS not a P12, but adding -storetype pkcs12 would do P12 so I'll assume that's what you meant. More importantly, keytool -exportcert (which officially superseded -export in about 1.5) exports the whole certificate, not just the public key. Specifying -rfc does it in PEM format, and omitting -rfc does it in DER format, but either way it's the whole certificate. 
Also your second code should not produce the same result; it should produce, perhaps modulo line breaks, the same as the body of the PEM format, but without the dashed BEGIN and END lines. The BEGIN and END lines are part of the PEM format, and without them it's not PEM. And without stating the correct type of the contents, which you don't, it's not correct PEM.
If you really want just the publickey you can do that, but don't expect it to be the same as the certificate because a publickey is not a certificate. Note that there there are very few applications that can use a publickey by itself without the other data in the certificate; the only one that springs to mind is SSH (which supposedly confirms the identity and validity manually), and OpenSSH does not use the ASN1-based ""X509"" (really SPKI) encoding supported by Java JCE but instead its own base64-MPI-based encoding.

I know that I can set the Public and Private key to be GLOBAL in which it can be used for other domains but why even need the keys in the first place?
","OK. This is my guess, no guarantee.

Your public key is required while generating client-side page.
The client uses this public key to request from recaptcha: an image, a corresponding correct answer and perhaps an id. Of course the answer and the id comes encrypted, using the public key. (So the client cannot know the answer)
User types in the answer, sends it to your server.
You have: {id, answer} encrypted using public key. You send your private key and this encrypted message to recaptcha server.
recaptcha unencrypts the message, revealing the answer and id, and checks if they match.
it tells your server the result of the check.

Note:

If the user sends a public key of his own to recaptcha, the check won't succeed since your private key does not work with his public key.
The scheme proves that your server is really the one receiving the recaptcha answer.

","Your problem is caused because your public key is an RSAPublicKey object rather than a SubjectPublicKeyInfo object (see this answer for a good description of the difference). You will need to convert from one to the other before your code will work.
BouncyCastle can do the conversion for you. The following code snippet will work, although I dislike it for two reasons:

It uses a deprecated class PEMReader.
It requires the BouncyCastle provider to be loaded.

Code:
Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());    
PEMReader reader = new PEMReader(new StringReader(rsaPublicKeyString));    
BCRSAPublicKey key = (BCRSAPublicKey) reader.readObject();
bytes[] = key.getEncoded(); // now in SubjectPublicKeyInfo format.

// as before...

With BouncyCastle, there is always many ways to skin a cat. Perhaps someone can find a more elegant solution than the one above?

Here is the ASN.1 schema for RSA Private Key,
-- 
-- Representation of RSA private key with information for the CRT algorithm.
--
RSAPrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE {
    version           Version, 
    modulus           INTEGER,  -- n

    coefficient       INTEGER,  -- (inverse of q) mod p
    otherPrimeInfos   OtherPrimeInfos OPTIONAL 
}

Version ::= INTEGER { two-prime(0), multi(1) }
    (CONSTRAINED BY {-- version must be multi if otherPrimeInfos present --})

OtherPrimeInfos ::= SEQUENCE SIZE(1..MAX) OF OtherPrimeInfo


OtherPrimeInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
    prime             INTEGER,  -- ri
    exponent          INTEGER,  -- di

I am sorry, I just used ToXmlString property of RSACryptoServiceProvider's instance.
Got the private key and public key.
","Hmm, I guess my comment is a good answer after all:
As you only transformed the modulus part of the keys and this part is there in both privat and public key it's no wonder.

","A key contains arbitrary bytes. And those bytes don't necessarily represent valid UTF8 characters. So you shouldn't transform them to a String, because that is a lossy conversion. If you really need a String, then use Hex or Base64 encoding.
To make you realize what the error is, let's say that you use ASCII instead of UTF8. ASCII characters go from 0 to 127. All the other 128 byte values don't represent valid characters. So if the key contain any of those values, the transformation to a String loses them. It's basically the same thing with any encoding (except, IIRC, ISO8859-1).

"6488383","What is the format of public key?","What is the format of public DSA key? And are all certificates are stored in base64?
","Do you mean the public key format used in a certificate? 
Generally, a public key in a certificate is stored in the SubjectPublicKeyInfo field (cf. RFC 5280)

SubjectPublicKeyInfo  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
     algorithm            AlgorithmIdentifier,
     subjectPublicKey     BIT STRING  }

The specifics for DSA can be found in RFC 3370. Usually the parameters of the AlgorithmIdentifier contain an instance of the Dss-Parms giving you p, k, g and the subjectPublicKey BIT STRING contains the public key y encoded as an DER-encoded INTEGER.
Concerning Base64: Strictly speaking certificates are not Base64-encoded but use an extended form of it, the PEM format, a plain text format which is the Base64 encoding of a X.509 certificate (RFC5280) enclosed between the lines 
""-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----"" 
...
""-----END CERTIFICATE-----"" 

or 
""-----BEGIN X509 CERTIFICATE----"" 
...
""-----END X509 CERTIFICATE----"". 

The certificate itself is the DER encoding of the ASN.1 structure as described in RFC 5280. See X.690 for details of DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules).
Most certificates are stored either in PEM format or directly in their raw DER-encoded form.

"13057948","Python: Paramiko authentication via public key ""not a valid RSA""","I'm attempting to communicate between two Solaris servers via Paramiko.  I can't use my private key for security reasons so am attempting to use id_rsa.pub.  Originally I tried this:
ssh.connect(hostname=host, username=user, key_filename=path-to-key)

...where ssh is an SSHClient object.  Eventually my googling led me to believe that connect really expects a private key, not public, so I tried the solution here.  The difference with this one is that it uses transport.auth_publickey to do the authentication, which I hoped would get me around any formatting hangups.  Here's the significant portion:
try:
    ki = paramiko.RSAKey.from_private_key_file(filename=key_file)
except Exception, e:
    print 'Failed loading {0}.  {1}'.format(key_file, e)
    return

I've checked my key_file and it is definitely pointing at my id_rsa.pub file, which is in OpenSSH format (I think; it starts with ssh-rsa and ends with user@host).  Still, I consistently hit the exception above, with e being, ""not a valid RSA private key file"".  Looking into the code, the closest error I can find to this is in the decoding step from BER.  I don't really know anything about BER or OpenSSH, but google seems to think they're the same thing, or at least compatible.
There are plenty of answers to similar questions here, but nothing that indicates why my solution doesn't work.  I'm not reading some strange format, I'm not confusing the key file with the key itself, etc.
Anyone have success using id_rsa.pub or an equivalent with Paramiko?  Preferably on  *nix.  I'm also open to, ""Hey, idiot!  Why are you using Paramiko when there's something so much easier!""  ...so long as the criticism is constructive.
","You can't use the public key when connecting to the server, you have to supply the private key, that's how public/private key authentication works! The example you link to also reads the private key and uses it to connect.
You could generate a keypair that you only use for paramiko, that way you don't need to expose  the private key you use for e.g. ssh etc.

What's happening in iOS 3.2 is that SecTrustCreateWithCertificates is treating the input value like a CFArray without checking first to see if it's a singular SecCertificateRef.  
To get around this, you can do something similar to the following code:
    SecCertificateRef certs[1] = { certificate };
    CFArrayRef array = CFArrayCreate(NULL, (const void **) certs, 1, NULL);
    if(SecTrustCreateWithCertificates(array, x509Policy, &trustChain) == errSecSuccess)

just remember to CFRelease(array) at the appropriate scope.

","Anything you do in Javascript can be seen and analyzed, as it's happening on the client side. So encrypting information securely client side is pretty much impossible. That leaves the server as the only point where you can and need to do validation.
Also, why would you care if an input comes from your script or is hand-crafted by a user? If the input is valid and allowed as defined by your rules, it shouldn't make any difference.

For this kind of situation, when in doubt, you need to see the importance of client/server separation. Your server is your app, it's the one and only critical component that you need to take care of. Every input is generally untrusted, every output must be exactly what you intend to disclose.
The HTML/JS interface you're handing to the user is just a help for the human to communicate with your server, but that doesn't mean it's trustworthy or securable once it has left your server.

","What users and paths are involved?  In the standard openssh setup, the $HOME/.ssh directory of the remote user (the one into which ssh is logging in) is the right location for the authorized_keys file.  However, it is also possible to have the files located elsewhere.
Also, check the file ownership.  The authorized_keys file must be owned by the user logging in.
A check of /var/log/messages or /var/log/secure (""ls -ltr /var/log"" after a failed attempt may help figure out the right log file) may give specifics.
If all else fails, you could strace the sshd process(es) to see exactly which files they are reading.  Not trivial to do, but it does get right to the guts of the operation of the server.

I first created my private key with a passphrase, but that didn't work, after I resaved the private key without a passphrase (using puttygen) but it still didn't work.
How do I fix this problem? I have been trying to work it out for so long but now am just totally stuck.
Thanks a lot!

You must to know two things: private key can be created is putty and openssh-compatible formats - and these formats are not freely exchangeable (client-side tool can understand putty or openssh only), Linux understand only openssh-type keys
You must use on client-side (additional) tool, which provide non-interactive authentication by key on request

A consequence of points 1 and 2
Windows-client: run pageant, load putty's private key into it (enter passphrase for key). Maybe you have to redefine in Git ssh-client from system to plink
Linux-client: on Windows-host load putty-type private key into puttygen and export into openssh-key. Save this file in Linux-box as /.ssh/id_dsa. Run ssh-agent, enter password once. ssh-agent will use password for key for all requests during session

I went through Bouncy castle WIKI http://www.bouncycastle.org/wiki/display/JA1/BC+Version+2+APIs but its not really explanatory for a beginner. How do I do this? Given a signed file, how can I check for its public key from the certificate store and verify if its the right person who has sent the file? Please advice.
","Because you did not provide what build management you use, I assume it will be Maven.

        log.info(""Result       : ""+result);

        assertTrue(result);
    }

}

Of course, you can change the Signature instance with another Algorithm. In my case I use ""SHA1WithRSA"", but you get the point right? 
With this, someone will encrypt their data using their private key, and send it to you. After that, you will verify the data using the public key they give.
In example, Bob send to you message about money amount he sent to you ($5000), and sign it using their private key, become encrypted. When the data arrived to you, you know Bob supposed to send $5000, then you verify the encrypted data with text $5000 and public key Bob share, but is it really $5000 OR does it comes from Bob?
If the data has been changed, OR when someday you ask for some Money to Bob, but the message tapped by someone else and s/he send you the amount message with private key other than Bob's, you will know.
Feel free to ask :)

When I send the same output to the server, it says ""cannot decrypt the PIN"". Why is this?

There could be many reasons for this. If you have the code for the server decryption, please add it to your question.
Reasons may include:

Wrong encryption mode. You've selected RSA/ECB/NoPadding but perhaps the server is expecting something else?
Base64 encoding - is the server definitely expecting this?
The message is ""cannot decrypt PIN"". If the data you are encrypting is the PIN are you sure you should be encrypting ASCII bytes?

Now, obviously Decrypt will fail, as since I'm trying to decrypt something which was signed (not ""encrypted"") and definately not by the same ""key"". I'm confused since I thought I should use a method like VerifyData(), but this returns a bool and takes arguments I'm not sure I have.
What I wish to accomplish is the C# equivalent of openssl rsautl -verify -inkey public.pem -pubin. That is, ""decrypt"" with the pubkey to verify the contents of said message.
Am I on the right track here?

","Actually a decrypt of a signature should never fail unless you specified the wrong encoding parameters - a signature is simply the private-key encrypted hash of the data (typically SHA1); the only benefit of using the verify routine is that it decrypts the block and does the hash comparison work for you, if you wanted to be bloody minded you could instead do a decrypt operation with your public key and compare the hash bytes yourself.
I'm not actually sure what response is in the context of your program; you should only be passing the RSA data to it, if you're also feeding it the data that was signed in the first place you are doing it wrong - similarly, do check if that function actually accepts a string, in my experience BouncyCastle generally expects a byte[]
I'd recommend using SignerUtilities.GetSigner() - it takes a string arg to tell it what sort of signature you're using, I would imagine ""SHA1WithRSA"" to be right for you.

","To complete the answer of GregS, assuming that you use Java as a programming language:

You should transform the Base64 encoding into binary. There are some Base64 decoders out there, e.g. this one, which appears to be ""public domain"", thus reusable at will. You could also implement it yourself; it is not hard. Wikipedia has the useful links for that.
Decode the binary blob using the SubjectPublicKeyInfo ASN.1 structure. This is not very easy (unless you master ASN.1) but existing code can be used for that. In particular, Java knows how to do that directly.

Public key decoding in Java looks like this (assuming the binary blob is in variable blob):
KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
KeySpec ks = new X509EncodedKeySpec(blob);
RSAPublicKey pk = (RSAPublicKey)kf.generatePublic(ks);

and from the RSAPublicKey instance, you have the getModulus() and getPublicExponent() methods which are self-explanatory. The relevant classes are in packages java.security, java.security.interfaces and java.security.spec. For your public key, this yields the following:
modulus         = 102645155313298195029358862270152655993457886674545775623230610032728692959011417523892551564448476401788726191516935717690886291325065114613951136136194912439244754958152467056511740824446734443711392654194943771385565670988939260236433577393483222184597978937921816958725758100559250155638540637401770719799

","Ok, I've found the answer. 
First, ssh-keygen -f theNewPrivateKey  otherwise it will overwrite the old private key.
Second, ssh -i theNewPrivateKey me@mycomputer the -i option changes the private key used for the authentication.

Edit: how does my new key has limited privileges:
When copying the public key to $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys2 file of the target computer, I added this: 
command=""sleep 99999999999"" ssh-dss AAAAB3NzaC1kc3MA...
(+ the rest of the key)

Then the only command allowed is to wait forever. 
Since the purpose of creating this key was to create a reverse ssh tunnel this should be fine. 
I then create the tunnel:
ssh -T -R 7878:localhost:22 -i .ssh/mynewkey  me@myhomecomputer

Finally I can log from my home computer:

According to this link on the Bitcoin wiki, it is possible to do so... But how?
To give you more details: as of now I have compressed keys (33-bytes-long) gathered on the bitcoin network.
They are of the following format: <1-byte-long prefix><32-bytes-long X>.
From there, I would like to obtain an uncompressed key (65-bytes-long) whose format is:
<1-byte-long prefix><32-bytes-long X><32-bytes-long Y>
According to this other link on the Bitcoin wiki, it should be as easy as solving the equation:
Y^2 = X^3 + 7 
However, I cannot seem to get there. My value for Y is simply far-off. Here is my code (the value for the public key come from the Bitcoin wiki example):

","The field of the elliptic curve is not over the field of real numbers. It's over a finite field modulo some prime. 
For Secp256k1 the prime p = 2^256 - 2^32 - 2^9 - 2^8 - 2^7 - 2^6 - 2^4 - 1.
Thus: y^2= (x^3) + 7 (mod p)

","You need to calculate in the field , which mostly means that you have to reduce your number to the remainder after dividing with p after each calculation. Calculating this is called taking the modulo and is written as % p in python.
Exponentiating in this field can be done more effectively than the naive way of just multiplying and reducing many times. This is called modular exponentiation.  Python's built-in exponentation function pow(n,e,p) can take care of this.
The remaining problem is to find the square root. Luckily secp256k1 is chosen in a special way (), so that taking square roots is easy: A square root of x is .
So a simplified version of your code becomes:
import binascii

p_hex = 'FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEFFFFFC2F'
p = int(p_hex, 16)
compressed_key_hex = '0250863AD64A87AE8A2FE83C1AF1A8403CB53F53E486D8511DAD8A04887E5B2352'
x_hex = compressed_key_hex[2:66]
x = int(x_hex, 16)
prefix = compressed_key_hex[0:2]

y_square_square_root = pow(y_square, (p+1)/4, p)
if (prefix == ""02"" and y_square_square_root & 1) or (prefix == ""03"" and not y_square_square_root & 1):
    y = (-y_square_square_root) % p
else:

","The usual way to do this would not be (direct) asymmetric encryption, but using an encrypted (and authenticated) channel to send the data, for example using SSL/TLS.
On the server side, you simply have to configure your web server to also offer HTTPS access.
On the client side, I suppose the easiest would be to use an HTTPS URL to send the data:
URL url = new URL(""https://example.com/myscript.php"");
URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();
conn.setDoOutput(true);
OutputStream out = conn.getOutputStream();

 // write data to stream

out.close();
InputStream in = conn.getInputStream();

// read answer from input stream

in.close();

I'm not sure on how to configure the accepted server certificates for Android, though.
This will (under the hoods) use the server's RSA key (in its certificate) to authenticate the connection and negotiate a session key for symmetric encryption.

I know the public key is generated using the secp256k1 named elliptic curve parameters, and a formula where publickey = G * privatekey, where G is some point on the elliptic curve (ECPoint?), but I am unable to transfer that named parameter spec and formula into actual coding of a public key. I know that since java 7, there are classes included in the java.security.* and java.security.spec.* packages to do this in short code, but I can't find a good example showing how to do this without using a third party library.

","An elliptic curve point is not an integer. Putting the encoded representation of a point (G) in a BigInteger and trying to use it as an integer is nowhere near correct. Elliptic curve point multiplication is not integer multiplication, and is nowhere near as simple as BigInteger.multiply. And it is written with the scalar on the left, e.g. kG not Gk.
Translating the standard (or at least conventional) algorithms given at the bitcoin Q to Java really should be a reasonably simple exercise for any Java programmer. 
Scalar Multiplication of Point over elliptic Curve contains (in the answer) a correct implementation for P192 aka secp192r1; it can be converted to secp256k1 by replacing p and a with the values from the spec (SEC2 from https://www.secg.org or X9.62 if you have it) or any existing implementation -- including Java (see below) -- and discarding the P192-specific test data. Actually you mostly need to change p; the Koblitz curves were chosen to have a=0. Elliptic Curve Multiplication Function contains a not-quite-correct implementation that is stated to be for secp256k1 but doesn't actually include the constants for any curve.

since java 7, there are classes included in the java.security.* and java.security.spec.* packages to do this in short code

Not really. First, Java crypto isolates the classes you see in java.security and javax.crypto from the implementation code, which is in entirely different classes (mostly (still) under sun.* and com.sun.*) in one or more 'providers' which are separate jars and technically optional; it is possible to remove, add, or change providers without changing the calls in your code, although most people don't. The JCA 'facade' classes for EC crypto were present since java 5 (called 1.5), but no provider implementing EC algorithms was included in the standard build; to use them you had to add a third-party provider. Starting in java 7 a standard SunEC provider IS included. However, JCA (for all algorithms not just EC) keeps private and public keys strictly separate after generation, and in particular it provides no way to access the private-to-public derivation logic that exists internally for EC.
It does include the parameters for several standard curves, including secp256k1, which you could use to avoid the effort of copying them from the spec. There doesn't appear to be a direct way to access this data, but you can do so indirectly by generating a nonce key and discarding it. Alternatively, since you already have a private key you can create the encoding Java uses (PKCS8) and read that in, producing the same curve parameters and also a usable key. In general constructing ASN.1 DER encodings like PKCS8 is fairly complicated, but for EC it is simplified because (1) everybody uses the 'named' form which encodes the curve as a single OID and (2) the standard specifies an encoding of the private value which is fixed in length for a given curve; as a result the PKCS8 encoding for a given EC curve consists of a fixed prefix followed by the private key value. Example snippets:
    KeyPairGenerator kg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance (""EC"");
    kg.initialize (new ECGenParameterSpec (""secp256k1""));
    ECParameterSpec p = ((ECPublicKey) kg.generateKeyPair().getPublic()).getParams();
    System.out.println (""p=(dec)"" + ((ECFieldFp) p.getCurve().getField()).getP() );
    ECPoint G = p.getGenerator(); 
    System.out.format (""Gx=(hex)%032x%n"", G.getAffineX());
    System.out.format (""Gy=(hex)%032x%n"", G.getAffineY());
    //
    byte[] privatekey_enc = DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary(
            ""303E020100301006072A8648CE3D020106052B8104000A042730250201010420""+

    // note fixed prefix for PKCS8-EC-secp256k1 plus your private value
    KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""EC"");
    PrivateKey k1 = kf.generatePrivate(new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(privatekey_enc));
    ECParameterSpec p2 = ((ECPrivateKey) k1).getParams();
    System.out.println (""again p=(dec)"" + ((ECFieldFp) p2.getCurve().getField()).getP() );

which produces output:
p=(dec)115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

Note those coordinates for the basepoint G match your expectation. I displayed a mix of decimal and hex just to show the possibilities; this does not affect the actual numbers in the computer.
ADDED in response to comments:
The variables p and p2 are ECParameterSpec objects which contain the parameters of an EC curve (underlying field, curve coefficients, basepoint aka generator, order and cofactor; and internally 'name' although the API doesn't expose it). The values I print labelled 'p' are the result of calling getP which returns one item from the curve parameters, namely the modulus of the underlying prime field, and thus the value you need to use in the calculations shown in the linked post where it does mod(p) and modInverse(p) and modPow(,p). Since this p (or P) is a parameter of the curve it is the same for all keys on that curve; note the two values I print are the same even though they are from different keys. There are actually two kinds of elliptic curves standardized for cryptography: curves over a prime field, denoted Fp, and curves over an extension field of characteristic two, denoted F2m. secp256k1 is the first kind, that's why the cast to ECFieldFp before calling getP(). 
Yes my fixed prefix contains the headers and fields identifying a privatekey (PKCS8) encoding as being for EC and secp256k1 and that prefix is the same for all EC secp256k1 privatekeys. The p values are as described above, and not privatekeys or publickeys. Yes if you had the public point you could combine it with the ECParameterSpec into an ECPublicKeySpec and convert it and use it -- or you could append the point encoding to a similar but different fixed prefix to get an X509EncodedKeySpec which is the encoding Java uses for publickeys and convert that without needing the ECParameterSpec in advance -- but your whole problem, as I understand it, is that you don't have the public point yet and want to derive it, which requires the point multiplication calculation shown in the linked posts.

","None.
Public and private key are used to negotiate a symmetric encryption key, that will be used during that session. Asymmetric encryption uses two keys (private and public), symmetric encryption uses only one.
Your server sends its public key to a client, the client validates that key signature (check the CA and all that) then use it to encrypt a randomly selected key that will be used as symmetric encryption key, and send it to the server. Because only the private key can decrypt that message, the message is secure, only the server can decrypt it. Then the server accepts that key selected by the client, and they start to transmit data using symmetric encryption.
Why all this? asymmetric encryption is quite computionally expensive, so it is just used to ensure that client and server can negotiate a secure symmetric key without sending it in plain text. Symmetric encryption is cheap.
Symmetric encryption is also safe, the problem is that both parts must know the key before start, and that is a big issue. By using asymmetric encryption for negotiating the key, this problem is solved.
UPDATE
Well, it seems that @EJP does not agree with my answer, so I tried to find some more documentation that explain the thing in an easy way.
http://www.techradar.com/news/software/how-ssl-and-tls-works-1047412

SSL explained
When you visit a bank's website, the bank's server will automatically
  redirect you to its secure site using the HTTPS protocol before you
  can log in. This results in your browser and the bank's site
  negotiating a secure channel using SSL.
This negotiation goes a little like this (note that I've simplified it
  greatly). The browser sends a message stating what the latest version
  of SSL it can support and a list of symmetric algorithms it can use.
  The web server sends back a message with the version of SSL and the
  algorithm that will be used.
It sends its certificate as well. The client verifies the certificate
  using the known certificates that came with the browser; in other
  words, it checks that it has been signed by a trusted CA and that it
  hasn't expired.
If the certificate is valid, the browser generates a one-time key for
  the session, encrypts it with the server's public key (it's part of
  the certificate), and sends it to the server. The server decrypts the
  key, then uses that key together with the agreed symmetric algorithm
  for the rest of the session.

I may be confused.

No.

None.

I assume the server will use client's public key to encrypt the response (by default? or upon configuration?).

No. See below. In most SSL connections the server doesn't even know the client's public key,if indeed the client even has one. This only occurs in so-called 'mutual' SSL, Where both peers authenticate to each other.

If so, does the server knows the client's public key from the request it sends to the server, or somehow else?

It only knows the public key if the client sends its certificate, which only happens if the server is configured to request it, which it usually isn't.
HTTPS runs over SSL, which uses a symmetric session key negotiated independently by both peers. It is never transmitted. The server's key is only used to provide a digital signature over its certificate, which the client can verify, which proves that that server owns that certificate. From there on it is all symmetric negotiation and encryption.

","Public keys are not directly used to encrypt any of the the underlying HTTP traffic on an HTTPS connection; neither the HTTP request nor the HTTP response are encrypted this way.  Rather, during the initial SSL handshake, a session specific symmetric key is negotiated between the client and the server, and it's the symmetric key that is then used to encrypt all traffic on the HTTP connection in both directions.
The specific mechanism by which the symmetric key is negotiated depends on the specific cipher suite that is negotiated between client and server.  This negotiation always involves the server's public key and a value sent by the client; it may also involve items like a client public key or separate connection specific public keys from the server and client.

The last step in my pipeline is an .sh file that deploys the necessary code on staging, however because my staging box uses public key authentication and doesn't know about the docker container, the SSH connection is being denied.
Anyway of getting around this without using password authentication over SSH (which is causing me issues as well by constantly choosing to authenticate over public key instead.)?
","You can now setup SSH keys under pipeline settings so that you do not need to have a private docker image just to store ssh keys.  It is also extracted from your source code so you don't have it in your repo as well.

Settings -> Pipelines -> SSH keys

You can either provide a key pair or generate a new one.  The private key will be put in the docker container at ~/.ssh/config and provide you a public key you can put in your host to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.  The page also requires an ip or name to setup the fingerprint for known hosts when running on docker as well.
Also, Bitbucket has provided IP addresses you can white list if necessary for the docker containers being spun up.  They are currently:

","The normal private key format for RSA includes the public key (the ""public exponent"" is useful for implementation of private key operations in a way which resists timing attacks). Therefore, it is possible to extract the public key from the private key.
(It is theoretically possible to have a ""pure RSA private key"" which does NOT include the public exponent, but it has drawbacks, such as much harder protection against side-channel attacks, and reduced performance. Therefore nobody in their right mind does that. You can assume that when you have the private key you actually have the complete key pair.)
In the C#/.NET standard library, public and private RSA keys can be represented as XML strings (ToXmlString() and FromXmlString()) or a custom RSAParameters structure (ExportParameters() and ImportParameters()). If you can obtain the complete private key then you just have to pick the public fields (modulus and public exponent), which constitute together the public key. Note that RSACryptoServiceProvider may be an interface to an underlying RSA implementation which could refuse to export the private key (but will usually accept to export the public key).

","I'm not sure I understand your problem completely. But you look like you are on the right track with using either Load/Save or BERDecodePublicKey/DEREncodePublicKey.

RSASSA_PKCS1v15_SHA_Signer signer;    
signer.AccessKey().Load(privateKey);

AutoSeededRandomPool prng;
bool valid = signer.AccessKey().Validate(prng, 3);
...

RSASSA_PKCS1v15_SHA_Verifier verifier(signer);
FileSink publicKey(""<public key>"", true);

verifier.AccessKey().Save(publicKey);

Then, you can use Gutmann's dumpasn1 to print it:
$ dumpasn1 <public key>
...

I believe you can also convert a private key/signer to a public key/verifier with:
RSASSA_PKCS1v15_SHA_Signer signer;
signer.AccessKey().Load(privateKey);

RSASSA_PKCS1v15_SHA_Verifier verifier;
signer.MakePublic(verifier);

","Your main problem is that the XDR-style encoding used by SSH for publickey, which OpenSSH uses to compute the fingerprint, is not the same as the encoding used by Java crypto, which is an ASN.1 DER format defined by X.509 formally called SubjectPublicKeyInfo. In fact I'm very surprised you were able to read an OpenSSH .pub file in Java; there is no direct way to do so. See numerous existing Qs on this at ssh-keygen and openssl gives two different public keys (disclosure: mine) but on a quick check I don't think any of them are Java so you'll need to do something like:
byte[] n = rsapubkey.getModulus().toByteArray(); // Java is 2sC bigendian
byte[] e = rsapubkey.getPublicExponent().toByteArray(); // and so is SSH
byte[] tag = ""ssh-rsa"".getBytes(); // charset very rarely matters here
ByteArrayOutputStream os = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
DataOutputStream do = new DataOutputStream(os);
do.writeInt(tag.length); do.write(tag);
do.writeInt(e.length); do.write(e);
do.writeInt(n.length); do.write(n);
byte[] encoded = os.toByteArray();
// now hash that (you don't really need Apache) 
// assuming SHA256-base64 (see below)
MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA256"");
byte[] result = digest.digest(encoded);
String output = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(result);

(Aside: Thanks linc01n for catching the bug -- I try to always compile before posting and I'm not sure how I missed this one.) 
The second problem is that OpenSSH has never displayed SHA256 fingerprints in hex. It originally used MD5 fingerprints in hex with colons; in 6.8 it switched by default to SHA256 in base64 (using the traditional alphabet not the 'URLsafe' one preferred by JSON) although you can still get the older form (in ssh use -oFingerprintHash=md5 or the equivalent config setting; in ssh-keygen -l use -E md5). Determine which one(s?) you want and code accordingly.
Or, if you have the .pub file, just read the second space-separated field of the one line, convert from base64 to byte[], hash that, and display.

thank you for your help..
","Maybe a bit late but there is my solution. Hope it helps others.
byte[] publicKeyBytes = keyPair.getPublic().getEncoded();

Here you're taking bytes of key and writing directly to file. So you get the appropriate result - DER-encoded file. However PEM is Base64 encoded format with line breaks each 64 symbols and header/footer.
There is code implementing this logic:
String publicKeyContent = Base64.encode(publicKeyBytes);
String publicKeyFormatted = ""-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----"" + System.lineSeparator();
for (final String row: 
        Splitter
            .fixedLength(64)
            .split(publicKeyContent)
    ) 
{
    publicKeyFormatted += row + System.lineSeparator();
}
publicKeyFormatted += ""-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"";

So publicKeyFormatted will contain PEM-encoded string of public key.
P.S. Splitter is a class provided in Guava lib, but you can split the string with a simple cycle or somehow.

My question is that, is there any way to get ""SSH key fingerprint"" automatically through code, if the user gives its .ppk file path only? 
","The .ppk is a key pair of your account and you specify that using the SessionOptions.SshPrivateKeyPath.
While the host key for SessionOptions.SshHostKeyFingerprint is for key pair of the server (= host). It's not a public key of your key pair.
These key pairs have nothing in common. You cannot extract one from another.
For details, see Understanding SSH key pairs.
See also Where do I get SSH host key fingerprint to authorize the server?

If you want to allow the user to verify the host key manually, use the Session.ScanFingerprint method to retrieve the fingerprint for verification. Once verified, assign the verified fingerprint to the SessionOptions.SshHostKeyFingerprint.

But the problem is, I can't get matching private/public keys for proper code-signing verification with the renewed certificates.  All I've read says keychain will automatically create matching public/private keys, but it's not doing it for me.  I am totally stumped and I don't know what I can do at this point.  Please help.  Here's what I've done so far:
1)  I revoked the certificates from Apple Developer > iOS Provisioning Portal > Certificates > Developer and Distribution tabs.
2)  I launched Keychain Access.app from Applications > Utilities.
3)  I removed all outdated certificates, and eventually removed everything except for Apple Code Signing Certification Authority, Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority, Dashboard Advisory and Software Signing.  (By the way, I have no idea what this ""Software Signing"" certificate is for, but it won't be expiring until 2015, I'm reluctant to delete it without knowing what it would do to the system if I deleted it.)
4)  I generated CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest via Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority
5)  Got the CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest on desktop.  (At this point, I check the Keychain, and I still don't see my private or public keys.
6)  I submit the CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest at Apple Developer > iOS Provisioning Portal > Certificates > Developer and Distribution tabs.
7)  I download the certificates, install them to keychain, and it looks like my certificates are now renewed for another year.
8)  I renew all provisioning profiles.
9)  I retrieve them to my Xcode.
10)  I generate new distribution build, then I get the warning that ""Application failed codesign verification.  The signature was invalid, contains disallowed entitlements, or it was not signed with an iPhone Distribution Certificate.""
11)  I look at the Keychain again, and I don't see my private or public keys. 
12)  Well, I exported p12 file a year ago.  So, okay, I start all over again (i.e., take the steps 1, 2 and 3.)  Then I import the p12 file.  Now I see my private key in my Keychain.
13)  I then resume with step 4 above (i.e., get the CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest via Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority)
14)  I continue on with steps 5 through 8.  Just to make sure, I reboot my machine again.  Then I check my Keychain, and public key is still missing, and taking steps 9 and 10 results exactly the same.
What am I doing wrong?  What should I do to fix this problem?  I'd so appreciate any and all help.

EDIT:  I'm not entirely sure which steps I took actually ended up fixing this, but I got it working now. Main thing was, deleting everything from keychain and look for possible cause all over the web, and and I did read this thread too:
http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20060318124936642
And run these commands:
sudo systemkeychain -vfcC
systemkeychain -vt
I also continued to look for how to repair keychain, run disk utility, repairing any and all permission issues, etc.
And eventually, my keychain access app started working as expected again, and it finally generated both private and public keys.  Ahhhh.  Once it did that, everything else worked fine, doing the steps I took earlier.

The issue I'm having is generating a public and private key pair I'm using RSACryptoServiceProvider, but I can only get the key attributes and not the complete public key.
RSACryptoServiceProvider RSA = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();
RSAParameters RSAKeyInfo = RSA.ExportParameters(false);

I'm unable to supply the micro controller with the key parameters as it only takes the key (as bytes). There is a library that will be able to do this, but it will only be available sometime in November 2012 (SW300055). I am using the SW300052 library to perform encryption on the micro-controller (key size is limited to 256 bits).
I've also tried bouncycastle suggestion in this thread (generating keys and showing them in a text box). It saves the keys in a PEM format. From what I understand the keys are saved in a base64 format. I've specified the key length to be 256 bits but when converting the public key back to bytes, it is 62 bytes.
byte[] encodedDataAsBytes = Convert.FromBase64String (publicKeyString);

I've also looked at Microsoft's Strong Name tool (sn.exe), but the minimum key size it supports is 384 bits.
Is there any way that I can generate a public private key pair and get the public key in plain text/bytes using c# (or with any other tool)? Am I just better off using symmetric key encryption to encrypt a session key?
","You can set up a certificate server on a windows box and request them directly. You'll need to install MS certificate services.
You can also use makecert and access the key with c#.
Or you could generate the keypair programmatically.

In simple steps.
login to AWS console, create a new pem key, it will ask you to save it to local, save it.
run the following command.
ssh-keygen -y | tee my_key.pub 
type the path to where you have saved the new pem key file along with the file name.
the above command will display the contents on the screen, copy it, and paste into the 
authorized_keys file of the EC2 instance, save and close. 
now you can use the saved/downloaded new pem key file to access the EC2 instance.

Although I was quite sure it was my machine trying to connect, I asked myself how I would confirm that.
This sprang two more concrete questions:

Where is the RSA public key?
How do I get the MD5 fingerprint for an RSA public key?

Additionally, I wanted a widely usable answer so the solution should be available to every Windows (win7 in my case) user without requiring installation of software.
","I'm using cmd and its for loop as well as certUtil which should all come pre-installed.
Open cmd by

pressing +R and typing cmd then confirming, or
opening Windows' Start menu, searching for cmd.exe and executing.

TLDR
for /F ""tokens=2"" %a in (id_rsa.pub) DO (echo %a) > tmp.key_base64
certUtil -decode tmp.key_base64 tmp.key_bytes
certUtil -hashfile tmp.key_bytes MD5

Where is the RSA public key?
Usually the keys are kept in the directory .ssh under the user's home.
(Android Studio stores different(!) keys, adbkey.pub, in the directory .android under the user's home and in its installation directory, here C:\Android\.android - both keys were issued to the phone during the process mentioned in the preamble above.)
After opening the console you should already be in your home directory and only need to change into .ssh
C:\Users\%USERNAME%>cd .ssh

In case you're not in your home directory type
cd \Users\%USERNAME%\.ssh

and execute.
(For Android Studio change directory to \Users\%USERNAME%\.android or \Android\.android respectively.)
How do I get the MD5 fingerprint for an RSA public key?
For this I needed to know that the actual key in the file is the base64-encoded part, i.e. the long cryptic string of characters. In my cases the key field was always followed by a user-host field, i.e. a string like user@domain.com (also unknown@unknown) and in some cases preceded by a field containing ssh-rsa.
In those latter cases I needed to filter the second field. In windows, apparently, this is done using a for loop. I also send the output to a file for subsequential digestion by certUtil, its output again brought into a file - containing the key no longer base64-encoded but in bytes - which is finally hashed using MD5.
Extracting the key which is in the second field of my id_rsa.pub to a file named tmp.key_base64:
for /F ""tokens=2"" %a in (id_rsa.pub) DO (echo %a) > tmp.key_base64

(First field for Android Studio's adbkey.pub: ""tokens=1"")
Base64-decoding to receive the actual public key in file tmp.key_bytes:
certUtil -decode tmp.key_base64 tmp.key_bytes

Hash the key using MD5:
certUtil -hashfile tmp.key_bytes MD5

I used this snippet for making signature:

now how use public key to test accuracy of signature ??
","PKCS8 concerns key formats - not signatures.
Also, I see you're using phpseclib to convert the key to pem and then using openssl. Why not just use phpseclib for everything? At that point you could use this example:

$rsa = new Crypt_RSA();

$rsa->loadKey('...'); // private key

$signature = $rsa->sign($plaintext);

$rsa->loadKey('...'); // public key
echo $rsa->verify($plaintext, $signature) ? 'verified' : 'unverified';

","Looks like key wrapping (encryption) to me. Use bouncy castle to read the PEM file, then use Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding"") to encrypt the secret key, and base 64 encode the result... You could also try the mode Cipher.WRAP_MODE to see if that works. Note that encryption will always return a different result, the only way to test for compatibility is to decrypt it with the other software.

First, server's public key can be used only to verify that the server you connected to is actually the one you wanted to connect to (i.e. there's no man-in-the-middle attack ongoing).
Second, certificate format of keys is never used with SSH. It's used with TLS/SSL, so for example with FTPS (FTP over TLS/SSL), or HTTPS.

$info = $gpg->import($pubkey);

I do not know this encryptkey : 
$gpg->addencryptkey(""96E9C3DC001C10B3AE6236B1FEFD88729C9BDD27"");

How can I get this fingerprint from public key?
","Generally, running gpg --list-keys --with-fingerprint --with-colons piping in the key will yield information on the key. You will get an easily parseable result like
pub:-:2048:1:FEFD88729C9BDD27:2015-09-27:::-:mytest <aa@aa.aa>:
fpr:::::::::96E9C3DC001C10B3AE6236B1FEFD88729C9BDD27:
sub:-:2048:1:22EC13225E681EFA:2015-09-27::::

The fingerprint is at a fixed column in the second line of the colon-separated output.
But when you're importing the key anyway, have a look at the output given by the code in your question, which already contains the fingerprint in $info:
Array
(
    [imported] => 1
    [unchanged] => 0
    [newuserids] => 0
    [newsubkeys] => 0
    [secretimported] => 0
    [secretunchanged] => 0
    [newsignatures] => 0
    [skippedkeys] => 0
    [fingerprint] => 96E9C3DC001C10B3AE6236B1FEFD88729C9BDD27
)

Importing a key anyway to receive it's fingerprint is a viable way probably not too expensive, you might even be able to somehow cache the fingerprints for the hashed keys. Calculating the fingerprint on your own is something possible, but would require writing your own OpenPGP parser code which is probably not something you want to do.

"26211480","Use JKS keystore for public key authentication with Ganymed SSH","I'm trying to extract a private key from a java keystore and then feed it to Ganymed SSH in order to establish a connection with public key authentication. It is however refusing to connect. 
I can successfully connect through Cygwin (ssh -i) with files generated by the following program, but the program itself is unable to get past authentication on the same machine. What am I doing wrong? 
I don't get an exception, Connection.authenticateWithPublicKey(String, char[], String) simply returns false, so this should not be a formatting problem. It does not matter if I leave the private key unencrypted, the result is the same. Also, I was able to connect with a program similar to this with files generated by putty-gen and ssh-keygen.
You will need the following to compile (bouncycastle and ganymed):

bcprov
bcpkix
ganymed-ssh2

Generate the keystore with:
keytool -genkeypair -keystore keystore.jks -alias myalias -storepass password -keypass password -keyalg RSA -dname CN=myalias,O=example.com -storetype JKS -validity 365 -v

Connecting to 10.0.3.138:22
Authentication failure.

Edit01
I've tried this with jsch and sshj and all of them fail to connect. There has to be something wrong with the above code for private key extraction. What baffles me is that I can connect with ssh -i. Also, if I load the above private key into putty-gen, I get the same authorized_keys string as in output from my program (already present in my remote machine's .ssh/authorized_keys). But if I save it as a ppk file and then try to establish a putty session with it, it doesn't go through either (server refused our key).
","There's noting wrong with the code I posted. It was just a huge fail on my part. 
I used the keystore alias name as a username which did not exist as a user account on the remote linux box. After creating the account, everything works. I was editing the wrong authorized_keys file (on some other account) and expecting it to work through some obscure dark magic known only to leprechauns, unicorns and apparently my brain.
As for why it worked when I did ssh -i... Defaults. Stupid defaults. I did not specify a username at all so it defaulted to the one Cygwin was currently using and it just so happened that it had the same name as the account on the remote where I was editing the authorized_keys file.
Great. Awesome. Just..perfect. I need to go find a bridge to throw myself off from now.
Doing what I do in my code works with ganymed, jsch and sshj (with some small modifications for the other two APIs).

From there, I can ssh into all of the other machines without being asked for my password.
What I want to do is to automate logging onto all of these machines from that one, but the script is running on my local machine. So I just learned about ruby-ssh-gateway and am trying that, but I can't seem to get pubkey authentication to work.
I do something like this:
gateway = Net::SSH::Gateway.new('gatewaymachine', 'username', :password => 'password')
all_machines.each do |machine|
  gateway.ssh(machine, 'username') do |ssh|
    uname = ssh.exec!('uname -a')
    puts ""machine: #{machine}; OS: #{uname}""
  end
end

But I get a Net::SSH::AuthenticationFailed exception.
If, instead, I provide the password, like so:
gateway.ssh(machine, 'username', :password => 'password')

it does work, but that's not viable, since passwords are not the same across machines.
Does anyone know how I can make this work?
Thanks.
","Are the machines you are talking to behind a NAT firewall?  If not, you don't need ruby-ssh-gateway.
Have you created a public key on the origin box, for the user which runs the program, and given that key to the target user on each target box?
$ ssh-keygen -t dsa    # Only do this once
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub user@machine
(enter the password)

and to make sure the key is working:
$ ssh user@machine      # should not ask for a password

Once you've done that, it's as simple as using system or backtick to shell out to ssh:
system('ssh machine ""ls -l""')

The end-user purpose of this is to use it later for transmitting user credentials to be authenticated when using an application away from the office, when I am unable to use their cached credentials from their workstations on the domain. I would theoretically be able to then decrypt these credentials using only the private key. 
I have produced a simple test class and code to reproduce my problem. The steps I'm taking are as follows:

Acquire a context to Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0
Generate a public / private key pair.
Export the public and private key BLOBs to separate files.
Load up the public key and encrypt some simple text.
Attempt to decrypt the same encrypted text using the public key (I expected it to fail here except for when I'm using the private key - yet both work).

Unfortunately I don't get the opportunity to work with C++ very often so you may notice some problems. Feel free to constructively criticize.
Does anyone know why I am able to decrypt data using the same public key?
My goal is to be able to irreversibly encrypt something on the client side where it can only be decrypted on the server, where the private key will hide. 
Edit:
I had considered that the hKey wasn't being destroyed properly by the ImportKey method, so I wrote this test case instead (same results - public key can encrypt and decrypt the data):
// CPPTests.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application.

    edc->Generate2048BitKeys(CALG_RSA_KEYX);

    //Export the private / public key pair
    edc->ExportPrivatePublicKey(L""privpubkey.txt"");

    //Export only the public key
    edc->ExportPublicKey(L""pubkey.txt"");

    //Destroy everything and load up only the public key to write some encrypted data

    edc = new TestEncryptDecrypt();

    edc = new TestEncryptDecrypt();
    edc->InitializeProvider(MS_ENHANCED_PROV, PROV_RSA_FULL);
    edc->ImportKey(L""pubkey.txt"");

    //Decrypt the data from file using the same public key (this should fail but it doesn't)

","The problem is that for some reason Crypto API, using the Microsoft Enhanced Provider w/ RSA, produces symmetrical keys. I am unable to get it to produce asymmetrical keys. The algorithm will, however, work with asymmetrical keys. So this is good news for us. This means to get this to work we only have to generate keys. You could also export these from self signed certificates, use your companies CA, etc.
To solve this I produced a public/private key pair using OpenSSL. I compiled OpenSSL for Windows just for fun then ran the following statements to get myself a pair of unencrypted public/private key files:

openssl genpkey -out private2.pem -outform PEM -des3 -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
or
openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -out private_unencrypted.pem

Once I had those I added 2 new functions to my test helper class, ImportPublicKey and ImportPrivateKey. These will only import PEM files without a passphrase. I don't consider that much of a security threat, considering the public is public and the private should hide on a secure server somewhere, perhaps encoded with a hash.

"34324466","Crypto API RSA public key can decrypt data, is not asymmetric as expected","The problem I am encountering is that I am able to decrypt data using the same RSA 2048-bit public key that was used to encrypt the data. It seems to me that this defeats the entire purpose of encrypting the data in the first place, if a public key can decrypt it. The only thing I can consider at this time is that I'm generating symmetric key exchange pairs when I think I'm generating asymmetric pairs.
The end-user purpose of this is to use it later for transmitting user credentials to be authenticated when using an application away from the office, when I am unable to use their cached credentials from their workstations on the domain. I would theoretically be able to then decrypt these credentials using only the private key. 
I have produced a simple test class and code to reproduce my problem. The steps I'm taking are as follows:

Acquire a context to Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0
Generate a public / private key pair.
Export the public and private key BLOBs to separate files.
Load up the public key and encrypt some simple text.
Attempt to decrypt the same encrypted text using the public key (I expected it to fail here except for when I'm using the private key - yet both work).

Unfortunately I don't get the opportunity to work with C++ very often so you may notice some problems. Feel free to constructively criticize.
Does anyone know why I am able to decrypt data using the same public key?
My goal is to be able to irreversibly encrypt something on the client side where it can only be decrypted on the server, where the private key will hide. 
Edit:
I had considered that the hKey wasn't being destroyed properly by the ImportKey method, so I wrote this test case instead (same results - public key can encrypt and decrypt the data):
// CPPTests.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application.
//

    edc->Generate2048BitKeys(CALG_RSA_KEYX);

    //Export the private / public key pair
    edc->ExportPrivatePublicKey(L""privpubkey.txt"");

    //Export only the public key
    edc->ExportPublicKey(L""pubkey.txt"");

    //Destroy everything and load up only the public key to write some encrypted data
    delete edc;
    edc = new TestEncryptDecrypt();
    edc->InitializeProvider(MS_ENHANCED_PROV, PROV_RSA_FULL);
    edc->ImportKey(L""pubkey.txt"");

    //Encrypt and write some test data to file
    edc->EncryptDataWriteToFile(TEXT(""Hello World!ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz""), L""encrypteddata.txt"");

    //Destroy everything and load up only the public key to read some encrypted data
    delete edc;
    edc = new TestEncryptDecrypt();
    edc->InitializeProvider(MS_ENHANCED_PROV, PROV_RSA_FULL);
    edc->ImportKey(L""pubkey.txt"");

","This API is deprecated according to Microsoft, so if you came here looking for a native cryptography API, you may want to look elsewhere.
After some fighting with the same problem I realized where the error was.
In your first code you were acquiring your context with the last flag set to zero:
CryptAcquireContext(&hProvider, NULL, pszProvider, dwProvType, 0);

But in your solution you changed it into CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT.
CryptAcquireContext(&hProvider, NULL, NULL, PROV_RSA_FULL, CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT);

You solved your problem by changing this flag, not by importing the keys from OpenSSL. I am pretty sure that if you test this in your initial code, it will work as expected.
This CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT flag is responsible for not allowing a key to achieve persistence in the system, a persistence which turned the public RSA able to encrypt and decrypt.

Permission denied (publickey)?I just don't know what does it mean.Can anyone provide me with some suggestions?Thank you in advance!
","In some cases of using ssh, when we meet the issues about Permission denied (publickey)?, it means two things:
1) we are using ssh key-pairs to access remote host.
2) we never let remote host know our local host's public key and don't have a private key to access.
Solutions:
step1: copy a public key to remote host(usually in ~/.ssh/authorized_key)
step2: paste the corresponding private key in local host's ~/.ssh/id_rsa(or id_dsa)

Based on the documentation, I'd expect this to return an RSAEntry which I could then decode into a public key. Is there something special I need to do to import public keys through this mechanism? Are GPG keys actually valid PEM files? Am I missing something else?
","ASCII-armored and PEM are very similar. You just need to change the BEGIN/END markers, strip the PGP headers and checksums (the checksum is the last line =Zqph), and add the PEM header. So, you have to change the inaimathi.pubkey to this file:

"45119932","Why does git sign with GPG keys rather than using SSH keys?","What are the differences between SSH and GPG asymmetric keys and why does git support signing with GPG rather than using the SSH agent?
","The very first notion of signing anything in Git was referenced in commit ec4465a, Git v0.99, Apr. 2005 (pretty much from the very beginning)
/**
 * A signature file has a very simple fixed format: three lines
 * of ""object <sha1>"" + ""type <typename>"" + ""tag <tagname>"",
 * followed by some free-form signature that git itself doesn't
 * care about, but that can be verified with gpg or similar.
 **/

So your question has legs.
The very first signed commit used gpg, but could have used anything else (commit 65f0d0e):
#!/bin/sh
object=${2:-$(cat .git/HEAD)}
type=$(cat-file -t $object) || exit 1
( echo -e ""object $object\ntype $type\ntag $1\n""; cat ) > .tmp-tag
rm -f .tmp-tag.asc
gpg -bsa .tmp-tag && cat .tmp-tag.asc >> .tmp-tag
git-mktag < .tmp-tag
#rm .tmp-tag .tmp-tag.sig

Technically, you can use gpg in place of ssh. I haven't seen often the reverse though.
But you can use an ssh key-pair be used with PGP/GPG.
That means the first validation script might still work (commit f336e71)... except it expected a PGP comment:
#!/bin/sh
GIT_DIR=${GIT_DIR:-.git}

tag=$1
[ -f ""$GIT_DIR/refs/tags/$tag"" ] && tag=$(cat ""$GIT_DIR/refs/tags/$tag"")

git-cat-file tag $tag > .tmp-vtag || exit 1
cat .tmp-vtag | sed '/-----BEGIN PGP/Q' | gpg --verify .tmp-vtag -
rm -f .tmp-vtag

So, ""Why does git sign with GPG keys rather than using SSH keys?"": it is what GPG is meant to do, as opposed to SSH, which cannot do with openssh alone (it needs openssl).
As commented by torek, using SSH would be theoretically possible, it's just not convenient. 

In addition, PGP has extra features (not that Git uses them directly—Git itself is just invokes some external software—but things like key revocation are useful in these contexts).

"45119932","Why does git sign with GPG keys rather than using SSH keys?","What are the differences between SSH and GPG asymmetric keys and why does git support signing with GPG rather than using the SSH agent?
","One likely reason is that not everybody using git is using ssh.
You can create a git repo and never have it leave your local disk. You can use the git protocol, or http, or https, or network filesystems... none of those things involve ssh, but you can still sign commits, because that happens independent of any network transport or other push/pull sharing of your commits.

","The reason why you should NOT use ssh for signing commits is the one of the common rules of cryptography: You should not use the same keys for different applications/use cases.
In SSH you use a key for authentication, but that is something different then the signing your commits. For this, GPG is much more suited as it is already widely used for signing emails, files and so on.

"16288158","Trying to implement PublicKey Authentication for SFTP test server using Apache Mina. However Authenticate method is not being called","I am using  Apache Mina SSHD to implement a test SFTPServer. I have been able to get things working for simple Password authentication, however I am not able to configure things for PublicKey Authentication. I have a implemented the PublickeyAuthenticator interface as follows,

    @Override
    public boolean authenticate(String username, PublicKey key, ServerSession session) {
        System.out.println(""In authenticate"");
        return false;
    }

}

My server implementation is as follows,
...
sshd = SshServer.setUpDefaultServer();


sshd.setPort(2222);
//sshd.setPort(config.getSFTPPort());

//sshd.setKeyPairProvider(new 
sshd.setKeyPairProvider(new PEMGeneratorHostKeyProvider(""hostkey.pem""));
//sshd.setKeyPairProvider(new SimpleGeneratorHostKeyProvider());

sshd.setPublickeyAuthenticator(new SimpleKeyAuthenticator());
sshd.setFileSystemFactory(new SimpleFileSystemFactory());

List<NamedFactory<UserAuth>> userAuthFactories = new ArrayList<NamedFactory<UserAuth>>();
userAuthFactories.add(new UserAuthNone.Factory());
sshd.setUserAuthFactories(userAuthFactories);

sshd.setCommandFactory(new ScpCommandFactory());

List<NamedFactory<Command>> namedFactoryList = new ArrayList<NamedFactory<Command>>();

namedFactoryList.add(new SftpSubsystem.Factory());

sshd.setSessionFactory(new SimpleSessionFactory(handler));
try {
    sshd.start();
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

However when I try to get a file using my SFTP client everything works. I would expect the authenticate method to fail given that it always returns false. I have tried setting the KeyPairProvider to use both the  PEMGeneratorHostKeyProvider and the SimpleGeneratorHostKeyProvider. I have also set the PublicKeyAuthenticator to use my SimpleKeyAuthenticator class.  Note, when I look at the console output I never see 'In authenticate' so I know that Authenticate is never being called. Could someone please point me to what I have missed? Any help is appreciated.
Regards,
Mark

","After being confused, I did a lot of research and I could find the solution. First of all, I will describe the situation then I will give the steps to solve the problem. Like I said in my Post, I had the private key (.key-file)  and the certificate (.cer file) and I need to use them in my java-application (server using ssl-protocol). So the first step to do is to create a keystore named.jks-file containing the certificate/key so that I can be able to use them for your java-based-server. To do this step I used the steps described in this link http://blog.jgc.org/2011/06/importing-existing-ssl-keycertificate.html
Now, how can I use my.jks-file in the above posted code?
Well this is a piece of code how to initialize your SSLEngine:
char [] keyphrase=""xxx"".toCharArray();
char [] passphrase= ""yyy"".toCharArray();

// First initialize the key and trust material.
KeyStore ksKeys = KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS"");
InputStream readStream = new FileInputStream(new File(""/.../file.jks""));
ks.load(readStream, passphrase );
// create an factory for key-managers
KeyManagerFactory   =KeyManagerFactory.getInstance(KeyManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
kmf.init(ks, keyphrase);
SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance(""TLS"");
//initialize the ssl-context
sslContext.init(kmf.getKeyManagers(),null,null);

","You'll need Java code to convert these serialized BigInteger values to a private key and public key. The base64 encoded binary seems to contain two serialized BigInteger objects, the modulus and the private exponent (which is now exposed). To retrieve PEM encoding it's best to rely on Bouncy Castle to do the conversion:

","The code in the question has a couple of mistakes, in order of appearance:

there are two different SHA512 implementations imported;
the payload is clearly not base 64 encoded, normal base 64 doesn't represent text nor does it contain _ characters (base-64-url however does);
the signature_algorithm and keytype variables are not even used;
the key should not be hashed to implement a normal PSS signature scheme;
the result of m.hexdigest() is ignored;
you cannot generate a signature generation class by SHA512.new(rsakey);
as said, your code doesn't even compile, because SHA512 class cannot sign;


Instead you can use any other PSS sample code. For instance, use the code here and notice that it is an issue that I'm pointing at. It's a minimal doc change but nobody seems to want to fix it for half a year.
from Crypto.Signature import PKCS1_PSS
from Crypto.Hash import SHA512
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto import Random
message = 'To be signed'
key = RSA.importKey(open('privkey.der').read())
h = SHA512.new()
h.update(message)
signer = PKCS1_PSS.new(key)
signature = PKCS1_PSS.sign(h)


Note that PSS can also use a hash internally, you may have to define your own callable code if signature verification fails, more information here. Probably best to lookup the default implementation for MGF1 in the code, copy it and then change the hash...

My problem is this: when I run the same SCP command within a PERL script, as a backtick bash command, it fails with the following debug.
$x=`scp -i /var/www/keys/living/id_rsa /var/www/$RS->[$x][3].dat living\@$a:/var/www/`;

I'm thinking the issue might be resolved if I can figure out why the SCP command run inside PERL is only trying once.

","The solution to this was that the permissions of the file ""id_rsa"" private key was set to 0660 and had to be changed to 0600.
A noob error that was obscured because the SCP command was being run within PERL
backticks as the child of a PERL fork with these commands:
 $|=1;$SIG{CHLD} = ""IGNORE"";

This causes debug from the child process to not show up in the Apache error_log, and no amount of debug was exposing the issue on either the source or destination servers.

"13747212","determine key size from public key (PEM format)","I'm trying to figure out the size of a public key that I received. How can determine the size from the key? I can't find a simple way in the documentation.
What I have is the public key itself, which I receive like this:
cert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(sock.peer_cert)
pkey = cert.public_key

The public key is in PEM format. So you have the start and end line, and in the middle the actual key. Now the key itself is base64 encoded. If I decode that string and count the bytes I get a size. This size includes some extras like exponent and modulus (Is there more?). What I need to know to determine the bits of the public key is how many bytes modulus and exponent (and if there is more, then that as well) take up.
","key_length_in_bits = pkey.n.num_bytes * 8

Quoting Wikipedia:

[...] n is used as the modulus for both the public and private keys. Its length, usually expressed in bits, is the key length. [...]

I use BN_bin2bn to create an OpenSSL bignum from raw binary data from a file. This is where we load your 256-byte modulus.
Then, I use BN_dec2bn to create a bignum from the exponent provided on the command line.
Next, I create an RSA object with RSA_new, and set the public exponent (rsa->e) and modulus (rsa->n).
Finally, I write the RSA public key to a PEM file with PEM_write_RSAPublicKey.

Clearly, the verification will fail because the key material is wrong! I don't understand why it is getting altered. 
But when I directly create a public key using java.security.PublicKey (anonymous inner class), the key material doesn't get altered. But when I pass it to verify, I get wrong algorithm type error (I passed RSA as the algorithm)

I put this (1) key to /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys
My logic behind this is that I need to put public key to vagrant box which I want to ship and once I execute vagrant up, vagrant client will be able to access that box without the password because I put there its public key.
But this is obviously not good solution and I do not understand what I am doing wrong.
I am able to do vagrant ssh where I put password ""vagrant"" and I am connected however when I look into autorized_key, it is EMPTY! But I am 100% it was not empty when I was going to box it with vagrant package ...

Using Godaddy for my SSL certificate middle man/provider, I got a:
.pem whoose contents beings with ""-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----""
(I'm assuming that's my private key)
Inside Godaddy I am able to download some certs for the SSL, they are:
.crt (type = Security Certificate)
.p7b (type = PKCS #7 Certificate)
Is one of the above my public key? Or is there another way I am supposed to get my public key?
","I have encountered this issue before with bad CSR Request. 
According to GoDaddy:
To install a digital certificate, you must first generate and submit a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to the Certification Authority (CA). The CSR contains your certificate-application information, including your public key. Use your Web server software to generate the CSR, which will also create your public/private key pair used for encrypting and decrypting secure transactions.
http://support.godaddy.com/help/article/5343/generating-a-certificate-signing-request
It also states: NOTE: When generating your CSR, specify a key size of 2048 or higher.
The key size is sometimes the culprit. Hope it helps.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists

I know what it means. However, id_rsa.pub does exist locally and it's copied to bitbucker as well, they are both identical. The repository exists also. 
What could the cause?
","Public Key issues

Check that you're putting in the correct remote repository path (i.e. git@github.com:username/reponame).
Debug the connection with ssh git@somehostname.com -T -vv to get verbose mode. 
Check the output. It will tell you what's going on. If you're still stuck, post it here and we can have a look.
ssh will often complain if your private key or its parent directories leading to the private key have higher permissions set than they ought to.

The key itself should be set with chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa, and the ~/.ssh directory to 0700 at most.
The ~ and ~/.. (parent directory, often /home on Linux and /Users on Mac OS X) should be set to 744 at most.
Also check that the group and user permissions are set correctly on the key and its parent directories:

$ id -un && id -ug   # check output of this command before using!
username
groupname
$ chown --recursive $(id -un):$(id -gn) ~   


This will reset all permissions on your home directory so your current user and group own all files. This may not be what you want. See man chown.

You may also want to check the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote host if you're still having trouble. Its permissions are also a point of failure.


Repairing OSX directory permissions
@AlexanderSupertramp, I said the permissions should be 744 'at most,' yes, referring to the requirements for SSH only. But I did not suggest that you should chmod the /home directory to that number. Each operating system has its own requirements for directory permissions, and I could only provide generic instructions since you didn't provide much information about your system. In any case, I am terribly sorry that my answer was not clear.
It is possible that your mac is failing to boot because 744 is too liberal. But I cannot be sure.  To resolve this you may want to pay a visit to the Genius Bar at an Apple Store or contact an authorized repair technician. You may also be able to fix the directory permissions automatically using built-in tools as follow:

Boot into single-user mode by pressing Command+S at the same time as the power button to turn on your mac, as explained in this article.
Launch the OSX Disk Utility from the menu bar, and then use the repair permissions tool as described in this Apple KB

","Not sure if you got it sorted or not but permissions on your private key may give that error without any further specification. I´m aware that you in this specific case probably didn´t change the file permissions though.
However, if thats the case, just sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/your_private_key
Especially putty in windows enviroments seems to just deny access, linux usually tells you to change the permission.

I run both just by opening two command prompts so I don't need to send it over a network or etc if it makes a difference. Just not sure how to make the public_key a pickle file and send it over socket. 
Server code:
import socket
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto import Random
from Crypto.Hash import SHA256

    print ""Connection from: ""+str(addr)
    while True:
        data = c.recv(1024)

    key = RSA.generate(1024, random_generator)
    public_key = key.publickey()        <----- need to pickle and send to client
    c.send(data)

Client code:

from Crypto.Hash import SHA256
random_generator = Random.new().readdef main():

host = '127.0.0.1'

","Pickling the output from an open port is asking for trouble (understanding pickle insecurity). Furthermore you're just adding a layer of complexity that isn't needed. RSA._RSAobj.exportKey returns a bytes object which can be sent directly over a socket, and is conveniently also exactly the data type needed for RSA.importKey().
Server:
#conn is your socket
conn.send(key.publickey().exportKey(format='PEM', passphrase=None, pkcs=1)) 

Client:
#you'll need to decide how to determine N: number of bytes received (should be constant for constant size key)

","Your command will only work if you can ssh to the server by entering a password. It also requires the dir ~/.ssh to be created on the remote server and lastly (as Jan-Erik Revsbech points out) the permissions on the local and the remote ~/.ssh needs to disallow others reading it.
If you instead use ssh-copy-id remote-server to copy your keys, then both the dir and permissions on the remote system will be set correctly. It will still require you to enter the password the first time, though.

","Make sure to also set the correct owner :)
I tried ssh-copy-id remote-server as suggested by Ole and got an error like this:
Cannot write to .ssh/authorized_keys. Permission denied
The directory ~/.ssh as well as the file authorized_keys were already present on the server and set up with the right permission... but for the wrong user! Here is, what solved it:
chown right-user:right-user .ssh
chown right-user:right-user .ssh/authorized_keys

I changed the owner of the file and the directory. Then ssh-copy-id  worked.

To encrypt/decrypt files of arbitrary size using asymmetric (public) key cryptography you need to use S/MIME encoding:
1) generate the key pair. This makes a 2048 bit public encryption key/certificate rsakpubcert.key and a matching private decryption key rsakpriv.key. The -days 10000 means keep it valid for a long time (27 years or so). You will be asked (twice) for a PEM passphrase to encrypt the private key. If you do not wish to encrypt it, pass the -nodes option. The public key can be distributed to anyone who wants to send you data. 
md C:\OpenSSL-Win64\bin    
cd C:\OpenSSL-Win64\bin

openssl req -x509 -days 10000 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout c:\opensslkeys\rsakpriv.key -out c:\opensslkeys\rsakpubcert.key

// pass phrase used: mypassword

2) Create request for self-signed certificate 
openssl req -new -key c:\opensslkeys\rsakpriv.key -out c:\opensslkeys\server.csr

3) Remove password from the private key 
openssl rsa -in c:\opensslkeys\rsakpriv.key -out c:\opensslkeys\rsakprivnopassword.key

4) Self-sign the certificate request (-days is expiration in days)
Important: start the command prompt with ""Run As Administrator"". Otherwise you get the same: unable to write 'random state' error.

set OPENSSL_CONF=C:\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.cfg    
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in c:\opensslkeys\server.csr -signkey c:\opensslkeys\rsakprivnopassword.key -out c:\opensslkeys\server.crt

5) Convert output to PKCS#12 format which we can use in code (-keysig parameter allows us to use key-pair for signing) 
openssl pkcs12 -export -in c:\opensslkeys\server.crt -inkey c:\opensslkeys\rsakprivnopassword.key -out c:\opensslkeys\mypublicencryptionkey.p12

How to generate public and private keys usable for both C and Java?

Generating the key pairs and representing them in memory is different than consuming them in Java or another framework/library, like OpenSSL.
Representing keys in memory is framework/library specific.
Encoding the keys so different frameworks/libraries can consume them is the trick.


However when I try to use the keys in Java the program chokes, saying the key format is wrong. 

In Java, its usually enough to call getBytes() on the key. The key will be provided in a natural representation. For example calling it on a RSA public key will result in an ASN.1 encoding from PKCS 1.
Other formats you can consider for interoperability are PKCS8 for private keys and PKCS12.
There's also PEM, but its an older format. PEM is OK for public keys, but you should use PKCS8 or PKCS12 for private keys.

The private you generated with OpenSSL is probably in encrypted PEM format (you should state the encoding you are using for them). See java read pem encoded key and How to read a password encrypted key with java?. If its DER encoded, then see java read der encoded key

Here are the steps I have followed:
Downloaded installed Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x64) de:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15336
Downloaded installed ""Win64 OpenSSL v1.0.2a Light"" de:

To encrypt/decrypt files of arbitrary size using asymmetric (public) key cryptography you need to use S/MIME encoding:
1) generate the key pair. This makes a 2048 bit public encryption key/certificate rsakpubcert.key and a matching private decryption key rsakpriv.key. The -days 10000 means keep it valid for a long time (27 years or so). You will be asked (twice) for a PEM passphrase to encrypt the private key. If you do not wish to encrypt it, pass the -nodes option. The public key can be distributed to anyone who wants to send you data. 
md C:\OpenSSL-Win64\bin    
cd C:\OpenSSL-Win64\bin    
set OPENSSL_CONF=C:\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.cfg    
openssl req -x509 -days 10000 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout c:\opensslkeys\rsakpriv.key -out c:\opensslkeys\rsakpubcert.key

// pass phrase used: mypassword

2) Create request for self-signed certificate 
openssl req -new -key c:\opensslkeys\rsakpriv.key -out c:\opensslkeys\server.csr

3) Remove password from the private key 
openssl rsa -in c:\opensslkeys\rsakpriv.key -out c:\opensslkeys\rsakprivnopassword.key

4) Self-sign the certificate request (-days is expiration in days)
Important: start the command prompt with ""Run As Administrator"". Otherwise you get the same: unable to write 'random state' error.
cd C:\OpenSSL-Win64\bin    
set OPENSSL_CONF=C:\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.cfg    
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in c:\opensslkeys\server.csr -signkey c:\opensslkeys\rsakprivnopassword.key -out c:\opensslkeys\server.crt

5) Convert output to PKCS#12 format which we can use in code (-keysig parameter allows us to use key-pair for signing) 
openssl pkcs12 -export -in c:\opensslkeys\server.crt -inkey c:\opensslkeys\rsakprivnopassword.key -out c:\opensslkeys\mypublicencryptionkey.p12    
// export password used: mypassword

At this point I can encrypt and decrypt files with openssl with these commands:
To encrypt:
openssl smime -encrypt -binary -aes-256-cbc -in c:\opensslkeys\todo.txt -out c:\opensslkeys\done.txt -outform DER c:\opensslkeys\server.crt

To decrypt:
openssl smime -decrypt -binary -in c:\opensslkeys\done.txt -inform DER -out c:\opensslkeys\redone.txt -inkey c:\opensslkeys\rsakprivnopassword.key

However when I try to use the keys in Java the program chokes, saying the key format is wrong. 
Any help greatly appreciated! I promise to post the com,plete working answer for others.

","I was finally able to make this work.
The starting point was: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/alejacma/archive/2008/01/28/how-to-generate-key-pairs-encrypt-and-decrypt-data-with-cryptoapi.aspx
Issues encountered
1)  Microsoft public and private keys used by CryptoAPI use a proprietary binary format (generally referred to as PUBLICKEYBLOB and PRIVATEKEYBLOB) that cannot be used by Java. Conversion of keys is required;
2)  The Crypto API encrypts in little-endian binary format while Java reads bytes in big-endian format. Ref: http://www.jensign.com/JavaScience/dotnet/RSAEncrypt/  and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness
Binary conversion is required;
3)  The Microsoft CryptoAPI pads the message when it encrypts it. This means to decrypt in Java, the exact implementation of the RSA algorithm is required which takes into consideration the padding scheme used.
On the Java decrypt side, I used Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/NONE/PKCS1Padding"");
Hope this is helpful to someone.

"42285185","SSH Public Key Authentication with Libssh2 C++","I am working on a project where I am doing port forwarding to MySQL using libssh2 in C++. I've got it working for username/password authentication but I now want do it using public/private key authentication. The documentation for libssh2 is pretty poor so I am having difficult working out what I need to do. 
What I am trying to do is have an Android app post data to my C++ app, where C++ will be given the SSH details along with the auth key and it creates the SSH tunnel. C++ is getting the key fine and then I am doing the following to do the public key authentication. 
else if (this->getAuthMethod() == SupportedAuthMethods::AUTH_PUBLICKEY)
    {

        string test = this->getSSHPrivateKey();

        boost::replace_all(test, ""\n"", """");

        unsigned char * key = (unsigned char *)test.c_str();

        size_t sizeofkey = strlen((char*)key);
        cout << key << endl;
        stringstream logstream;
        logstream << ""Using public key authentication for SSH Host: "" << this->getSSHHostnameOrIPAddress();
        this->bitsLibrary->writeToLog(logstream.str(), ""SSHTunnelForwarder"", ""authenticateSSHServer"");
        if (chosenAuthMethod & SupportedAuthMethods::AUTH_PUBLICKEY)
        {
            //int result = 0;
            int result = libssh2_userauth_publickey(this->session, this->getUsername().c_str(), key, sizeofkey, SSHTunnelForwarder::publicKeyAuthComplete, 0);
            if (result != 0)
            {
                char * error = NULL;
                int len = 0;
                int errbuf = 0;
                libssh2_session_last_error(this->session, &error, &len, errbuf);
                this->bitsLibrary->writeToLog(std::string(error), ""SSHTunnelForwarder"", ""auth"");
                JSONResponseGenerator jsonResponse;
                jsonResponse.generateJSONResponse(API_AUTH_FAILURE, ""InvalidPublicKey"");
                return jsonResponse.getJSONString();

            }
        }
    }

I read somewhere that it shouldn't have new lines, that's why I'm replacing the \n for blank characters but with or without this it doesn't make a difference. 
The very basic documentation mentions that one of the arguments for libssh2_userauth_publickey is a callback as follows:
int name(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, unsigned char **sig, size_t *sig_len, const unsigned char *data, size_t data_len, void **abstract);
but I cannot find any information anywhere as to what this callback is or what it should contain. In my function call to libssh2_userauth_publickey I pass in SSHTunnelForwarder::publicKeyAuthComplete and currently this function just has the following:
int SSHTunnelForwarder::publicKeyAuthComplete(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, unsigned char **sig, size_t *sig_len,
    const unsigned char *data, size_t data_len, void **abstract)
{
    cout << ""In SSH Auth Callback"" << endl;
    return 0;
}

This method above doesn't get called, although I'm expecting that this isn't even close to being correct. 
When I run my code above the result of libssh2_userauth_publickey is 19 and the error that is returned from the get_last_message() method is invalid public key. I know the public key file is fine as I can use it in an SSH app on Android and can successfully authenticate with my server. 
UPDATE 1
I've managed to make some progress, I found there is a function called:
libssh2_userauth_publickey_frommemory(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, const char *username, size_t username_len, const char *publickeyfiledata, size_t publickeyfiledata_len, const char *privatekeyfiledata, size_t privatekeyfiledata_len, const char *passphrase);

The libssh2 version that I had was from NuGet Package manager and found that the latest version in this is actually quite old, so I've build the latest 1.7.0 version from GitHub inside Visual Studio and relinked my project to this new version. 
I have now replaced the original publickey auth function I was using with this version so my code now looks like this instead:
int result = libssh2_userauth_publickey_frommemory(this->session, username.c_str(), username.length(), nullptr, 0, test.c_str(), sizeofkey, nullptr);

This function confuses me a little that it wants the public key and the private key, for everything I know about SSH (admittedly not a huge amount) the public key stays on the server, and the user wanting to login only has access to the private key. 
I found that someone else was asking this and a patch was done to allow a null pointer for the public key, so I have passed nullptr for the public key and 0 for the public key length. I've also put a nullptr for the certificate passphrase as this hasn't been set. 
When I run this code now I now get the error -18 which is invalid username/public key combination. Again though, I know the username and private key file I am using is correct as I can use it in an SSH client application on Android to connect to my SSH server. 
","I've found the solution. What I did in update 1 was the actual fix but my server key got changed for some reason not sure why, so when it said that it couldn't link the username with the key it was correct. 
The complete fix is as follows:
Don't use the libssh2 from NuGet its very old. I downloaded the latest source from GitHub at https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/releases and then completed the follwing steps to build libssh2 within Visual Studio. 

Shove all the .c files in libssh2/src into an empty Win32 C++ (DLL 
or Static Library) project except libgcrypt.c/openssl.c of which you 
only pick the one appropriate to your crypto library. 
Add your OpenSSL or libgcrypt include directory to the project include path 
Add libssh2/include to the project include path 
Add libssh2/win32 to the project include path 
Add the appropriate crypto libraries to the project Additonal Libraries list 
Build 
Job done 

Steps above taken from https://www.libssh2.org/mail/libssh2-devel-archive-2012-09/0029.shtml
The libssh2 was linked to openssl during compilation. 
Link your project to the latest build you've just done for libssh2 and use the method 
libssh2_userauth_publickey_frommemory(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, const char *username, size_t username_len, const char *publickeyfiledata, size_t publickeyfiledata_len, const char *privatekeyfiledata, size_t privatekeyfiledata_len, const char *passphrase);

And that's it.

// returns 65537

You can convert the values to a hex like so,

","A certificate is not a public key although it contains one; more importantly, either a private key or public key or certificate for a public-key-crypto (aka asymmetric) scheme like RSA is not a symmetric key. Java SecretKeySpec is only for symmetric keys used with symmetric algorithms, like AES. 
You need to represent your RSA keys using subtypes of java.security.PrivateKey and java.security.PublicKey. The way you do this is with a KeyFactory for RSA, or a CertificateFactory (as you already did). 
For a PKCS#8-encoded private key, which is what you encoded and wrote out, decode it from PEM/base64 to byte[], then:
PKCS8EncodedKeySpec spec = new PKCSEncodedKeySpec (bytearray);
KeyFactory factory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
PrivateKey privkey = factory.generatePrivate (spec);
// use privkey in a Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"") to decrypt or sign

For a certificate do basically what you already did: 
InputStream is = /* something that returns contents of cert file */;
// you *can* decode from PEM/base64 first, but you don't need to;
// CertificateFactory-X.509 handles both
CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance (""X.509"");
Certificate cert = cf.generateCertificate (is);
// use cert.getPublicKey() for RSA encrypt or verify

Aside: sigAlgName for a certificate does NOT tell about the key in the cert. It is entirely possible for a cert signed SHA1withRSA to contain a DSA or ECC key that cannot be used for RSA, and conversely possible for a cert that contains a perfectly good RSA key to be signed with a different RSA variant (like SHA256withRSA) or an entirely different algorithm (like sha1-DSA or sha2-ECDSA).
Also note: you are explicitly importing java.security.cert.Certificate; that's good. JRE also has an older and deprecated java.security.Certificate which you should not use, but if you just say Certificate some IDEs (like mine) may get confused and give you the wrong one.

"21757387","RSA algorithm in Java : How works getEncoded method on java.security.Key interface?","I would like to be more familiar with the RSA algorithm and I have made small project for that. Actually everithing works fine, I can encrypt and decrypt a message correctly but I don't know if my key generation is performed correctly (my objective is to obtain a public key with a byte array representation that I can export for other parts).
Here comes how my keys are generated:
KeyPairGenerator keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"");
SecureRandom random = SecureRandom.getInstance(""SHA1PRNG"", ""SUN""); 

random.nextBytes(new byte[128]);

keyGen.initialize(1024, random);

KeyPair keyPair = keyGen.generateKeyPair();

PublicKey pubKey = keyPair.getPublic();
PrivateKey privKey = keyPair.getPrivate();

byte[] publicKeyEncoded  = pubKey.getEncoded();
byte[] privateKeyEncoded = privKey.getEncoded();

My question is about the getEncoded method, each time my program is executed a new key pair seems to be generated (according my trace) but when I call this method I have still the same value, it seems fixed. The value is changed when the method is called a second times and is changed each times that I call it in my program, but if a new execution is performed, the first value is the same as first value of the previous execution event if the keys differs. 
According the documentation it seems that it ""Returns the key in its primary encoding format ..."", I have checked my key format, it is X.509, but there is nothing about the described behavior.
Can you please give me more details about that ?
","I have tested the code snippet you provided in a standalone java program. Every time I call it, a new different key is generated. If your code always generate the same sequence of key it means that the random number generator produces the same sequence of number.
SHA1PRNG is a PRNG, it means that the sequence of number produced depends on a seed. If the PRGN is seeded twice with the same seed, it will produce the same sequence of numbers. The seed is set as follows:

by calling setSeed(byte[]) on SecureRandom
the first next/nextBytes is called and setSeed has not been previously called the PRGN is seeded with a secure mechanism provided by the underlying OS.

Since the code you posted here does not call setSeed, the SecureRandom object should be properly seeded with some true random value.
My suggestions:

Are you sure that you do not call setSeed (with the same seed value)? This could explain this behavour. Note also that the key encoding provided by getEncoded() always starts with the same byte sequence 30819f300d06092a864886f70d010101050003818d00
Try to use random = new SecureRandom(). It will use the default SecureRandom implementation for your platform (For windows as far as I known it is the SHA1PRNG implementation but Linux and MaxOSX are using another implementation)

"49057905","Calculating d value in RSA","I saw a couple questions about this but most of them were answered in unhelpful way or didn't get a proper answer at all.  I have these variables:

p = 31
q = 23
e - public key exponent = 223
phi - (p-1)*(q-1) = 660


Now I need to calculate d variable (which I know is equal 367). The problem is that I don't know how. I found this equation on the internet but it doesn't work (or I can't use it):
e⋅d=1modϕ(n)

When I see that equation i think that it means this:
d=(1modϕ(n))/e

But apparently it doesn't because 367 (1modϕ(n))/e = 1%660/223 = 1/223 != 367
 Maybe I don't understand and I did something wrong - that's why I ask.
I did some more research and I found second equation:
d=1/e mod ϕ(n)
or
d=e^-1 mod ϕ(n)

But in the end it gives the same result:
1/e mod ϕ(n) = 1/223 % 660 = 1/223 != 367
Then I saw some guy saying that to solve that equation you need extended Euclidean algorithm If anyone knows how to use it to solve that problem then I'd be very thankful if you help me.
","If you want to calculate something like a / b mod p, you can't just divide it and take division remainder from it. Instead, you have to find such b-1 that b-1 = 1/b mod p (b-1 is a modular multiplicative inverse of b mod p). If p is a prime, you can use Fermat's little theorem. It states that for any prime p, ap = a mod p <=> a(p - 2) = 1/a mod p. So, instead of a / b mod p, you have to compute something like a * b(p - 2) mod p. b(p - 2) can be computed in O(log(p))
 using exponentiation by squaring. If p is not a prime, modular multiplicative inverse exists if and only if GCD(b, p) = 1. Here, we can use extended euclidean algorithm to solve equation bx + py = 1 in logarithmic time. When we have bx + py = 1, we can take it mod p and we have bx = 1 mod p <=> x = 1/b mod p, so x is our b-1. If GCD(b, p) ≠ 1, b-1 mod p doesn't exist.
Using either Fermat's theorem or the euclidean algorithm gives us same result in same time complexity, but the euclidean algorithm can also be used when we want to compute something modulo number that's not a prime (but it has to be coprime with numer want to divide by).

","An RSA key does not consist of random bytes like for instance an AES key; it consists of numbers. The key size of RSA is defined by the modulus, but it also requires a public exponent (usually the fourth number of Fermat or another small prime). So with getEncoded() both are returned embedded into an ASN.1 DER encoded byte array that is usually present in X5.09 certificates called SubjectPublicKeyInfo.
If you want to extract the key size, use ((RSAPublicKey) publicKey).getModulus().bitLength() instead. To have a look at the structure, use openssl asn1parse or use an online decoder such as this.

"25619719","svn+ssh with public key on linux: merge fails but co, up, commit works","I have the following problem: I followed the many tutorials one can find on setting up a public key access via svn+ssh to a subversion repository on a linux machine with ssh-only access. It seems to work for checkouts, updates and commits, but if someone tries to merge or uses the ^ operator to copy, it crashes.
Let me give more information in the form of an example: The svn repository is in the folder /home/bob/svn/project of machine mymachine.myhost.com and belongs to user bob (aka: me). I generated a key for alice and added the following line to /home/bob/.ssh/authorized_keys:
command=""/usr/bin/svnserve -t -r /home/bob/svn/project --tunnel-user=Alice"",no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty ssh-rsa <alices key> alice

Alice was able to checkout the repository using
svn co svn+ssh://bob@mymachine.myhost.com@

She can commit changes and update. However, if she tries to merge or do svn cp using the ^ operator on her machine as follows:
svn cp ^/trunk/ branches/alicesbranch

te server does not react and after a while she gets the following message
svn: E210002: Unable to connect to a repository at URL 'svn+ssh://bob@mymachine.myhost.com/trunk/'
svn: E210002: To better debug SSH connection problems, remove the -q option from 'ssh' in the [tunnels] section of your Subversion configuration file.
svn: E210002: Network connection closed unexpectedly

After some research, I gave up, because in most cases I only get discussions from people where the repository could not be accessed at all. However in my case, I/Alice do have access, but not as general as some svn operations Seem to need.
I believe that I did something wrong with the combination of the svnserve command and the path Alice uses to checkout, but I don't know what.
In reality, the server is a machine for which I don't have root access. Also, the network seems to be very shielded from external access: Only ssh is allowed, but as soon as for example the above error occurs, I/Alice cannot login at all on said hostname for a while, probably because the firewall declines access for a while for security reasons because of a failed ssh connection. This is also why I cannot just go ahead and do lots of trial-and-errors with different svnserve commands and different checkout commands, because every error will force me to wait until I can do another trial.
This is why I hope someone here can help me. I hope I gave enough information to pin down the problem.
Sincerly,

/home/alice/mysvnprojects/myprojectwithbob: svn cp ^/trunk branches/mytestbranch
  svn: E210002: Unable to connect to a repository at URL     'svn+ssh://bob@mymachine.myhost.com/project/trunk'
  svn: E210002: To better debug SSH connection problems, remove the -q option from     'ssh' in the [tunnels] section of your Subversion configuration file.
  svn: E210002: Network connection closed unexpectedly

If I do 
svn cp ^/trunk ^/branches/mytestbranch

instead, it seems to work! However, I still cannot merge 
cd trunk 
svn merge ^/branches/mytestbranch .

leads to the known error.
Edit 3:
It seems as if everything fails which tries to access anything beyond the root directory.
For example: 
svn co svn+ssh://bob@mymachine.myhost.com@

works, but [assuming the basic setup where ""svnserve -r /home/bob/svn/project"" is used]
svn co svn+ssh://bob@mymachine.myhost.com/trunk

fails. This seems to be a common denominator to all failing and working cases.
","First you need to create the svn structure, by creating the directories trunk, branches and tags in the root of the project and commit this changes. Otherwise there is obviously no trunk and branches on the server an the ^/trunk and ^/branches/branch commands fail.
The problem is, you are checking out the whole repository instead of the trunk. You are supposed to work on the trunk or the branch and use svn switch to switch between them. To get it work, try to checkout the project with this command:
svn co svn+ssh://bob@mymachine.myhost.co/project/trunk

If you now try to merge it should work. The problem is, you are trying to merge the whole repository with the branch, which is actually a subfolder of that repository. So to switch to the Alice branch use:
svn switch ^/branches/mytestbranch

If you want want merge it back to trunk, switch back to it first by using
svn switch ^/trunk

And then doing a 
svn merge ^/branches/mytestbranch

Checkout a Tutorial of howto use svn and which workflows are best practice.

"6460845","Standard way to hash an RSA key?","What's the algorithm for creating hash (sha-1 or MD5) of an RSA public key?  Is there a standard way to do this?  Hash just the modulus, string addition of both and then take a hash?  Is SHA-1 or MD5 usually used?
I want to use it to ensure that I got the right key (have the sender send a hash, and I calculate it myself), and log said hash so I always know which exact key I used when I encrypt the payload.
","Based on the OpenSSH source code, the way that a fingerprint is generated for RSA keys is to convert n and e from the public key to big-endian binary data, concatenate the data and then hash that data with the given hash function.
Portions of the OpenSSH source code follows.  The comments were added to clarify what is happening.
// from key_fingerprint_raw() in key.c
switch (k->type) {
case KEY_RSA1:
    // figure out how long n and e will be in binary form
    nlen = BN_num_bytes(k->rsa->n);
    elen = BN_num_bytes(k->rsa->e);
    len = nlen + elen;
    // allocate space for n and e and copy the binary data into blob
    blob = xmalloc(len);
    BN_bn2bin(k->rsa->n, blob);
    BN_bn2bin(k->rsa->e, blob + nlen);

...

// pick a digest to use
switch (dgst_type) {
case SSH_FP_MD5:
    md = EVP_md5();
    break;
case SSH_FP_SHA1:
    md = EVP_sha1();
    break;

...

// hash the data in blob (n and e)
EVP_DigestInit(&ctx, md);
EVP_DigestUpdate(&ctx, blob, len);
EVP_DigestFinal(&ctx, retval, dgst_raw_length);

From the BN_bn2bin manual page:
BN_bn2bin(a, to) converts the absolute value of a into big-endian form and stores it at to. to must point to BN_num_bytes(a) bytes of memory.

"19272734","SSH connect with Putty/Win7 to OpenSSH/Debian shows Server refused public-key signature despite accepting key","i'm running a server with Debian Linux 3.2.46 and OpenSSH Server 6.0 and secured the login with a 2048 bit RSA key.
Although connecting with OpenSSH Client from another machine works, the connection is refused when using Putty 0.63 on a Windows 7 machine with the following message:
Server refused public-key signature despite accepting key!

Because the problem applies only to Putty, i think all server configuration is correct. Putty works fine when running the server with Debian 2.6.32 and OpenSSH 5.5.
Here is the content of the auth.log:

After this happens, server switches to password auth and i'm able to login fine.
My question: Somebody out there who knows whats going wrong or what was changed in OpenSSH? Any suggestions for a fix?

ssh -p 22 login@134.*.*.*
Connection to 134.*.*.* closed by remote host.
Connection to 134.*.*.* closed.

I hidden ip for security.
During docker container building, I add my ssh public key to /home/login/.ssh/authorized_keys. Then I start my container (with sshd running) and open 22 port. 
In local (with docker on my server), I can connect to ssh with my private key to the container. But when I start container on Bluemix, I can't connect to ssh even after attribute public ip address and, of course, publish 22 tcp port.
To run my container that I push to ibm repo, I use ICE cli to run container with a entry point script which start all services (within sshd).
ice run --publish 8572 --publish 8787 --publish 22 --memory 2048 --name boardvisor registry.ng.bluemix.net/org/test:latest  /run.sh

Then I go to bluexmix web dashboard to attribute public ip address
As I receive a response to sshd server, the container seems work and reachable but I don't understand why I can connect on my docker server but not on bluemix server.

","Since the container works and it is reachable but you can't access it only on Bluemix, I suggest you to open a support request directly from your Bluemix console using the support/help widget or sending an email to support@bluemix.net: in this way you'll involve IBM Containers support team in checking and fix this issue. They will be able to perform in-depth investigation of your error.
Please provide org and space guids and some details on the image you used.
You can retrieve org and space guids using CF CLI (when you already logged in):

"34088357","SSH connection to my container closed by remote host","I try to connect to my bluemix running container but I get this error :
ssh -p 22 login@134.*.*.*
Connection to 134.*.*.* closed by remote host.
Connection to 134.*.*.* closed.

I hidden ip for security.
During docker container building, I add my ssh public key to /home/login/.ssh/authorized_keys. Then I start my container (with sshd running) and open 22 port. 
In local (with docker on my server), I can connect to ssh with my private key to the container. But when I start container on Bluemix, I can't connect to ssh even after attribute public ip address and, of course, publish 22 tcp port.
To run my container that I push to ibm repo, I use ICE cli to run container with a entry point script which start all services (within sshd).
ice run --publish 8572 --publish 8787 --publish 22 --memory 2048 --name boardvisor registry.ng.bluemix.net/org/test:latest  /run.sh

Then I go to bluexmix web dashboard to attribute public ip address
As I receive a response to sshd server, the container seems work and reachable but I don't understand why I can connect on my docker server but not on bluemix server.
I provide you the ssh verbose connection :

","One principle in using containers is that a container should not start more than one process, in your case ssh and whatever the container is running.
Also there is another way to access your container with exec
Scince Docker 1.3 you can access an runing container with:
docker exec COMMAND
in practice for bluemix:
cf ic exec -it CONTAINER /bin/bash
this starts the binary bash with an absolute path (/bin/bash part) and attaches the tty interactively + keeps connection open (-it part).

The first one still works with the private key generated by Amazon but the second public key doesn't recognize the private key PuTTYgen created.
I get

Server refused our key

","When I follow the (correct) instructions you have pointed to yourself, my id_rsa.pub file follows expected format:
ssh-rsa <key> comment>

Had you appended a public key in the above format, it would work.
While I believe you actually have not followed the instructions, but saved the public key from PuTTYgen is its own multi-line format (as we can see in your resulting authorized_keys).
OpenSSH server does not understand that format.
Solutions:

Either really follow the instructions you have pointed to completely (particularly generate the key pair using ssh-keygen)
Or follow PuTTYgen instructions and copy-paste the public key in OpenSSH format from PuTTYgen box labeled Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file.

I still get asked for a password. So I thought that the problem could come from some parameter avoiding public keys without passphrase and I created a new publickey/privatekey couple with a passphrase. But still, I get the following message :

For information, I created the key couple with the command :

Having a friend who has got the same laptop as me (last mbp Retina 13""), with whom ssh localhost works fine, I noted that he's got the additional lines at the beginning when executing ssh -vvv localhost :

For the record, I already checked these pages and tried what's proposed, without success : 
SSH: "Bad passphrase" after generation of public key
and 
ssh: Permission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive)
Thanks in advance for any advice, idea or solution
","From manual page for sshd(8):

~/.ssh/authorized_keys
The content of the file is not highly sensitive, but the recommended permissions are read/write for the user, and not accessible by others.

You will find in the server log something about not using your authorized_keys, because it has too wide permissions. You should change the permissions to be readable and writable only by you: chmod 600 ~/.ssh.authorized_keys

"37377207","Unable to ssh localhost on Mac OS El Capitan","I am having some troubles while trying to make a ssh localhost connexion. I want to do this without passphrase, so when I created the public key/private key couple, I typed on the return key when asked for the passphrase, as indicated.
When I try the command
    ssh localhost

I still get asked for a password. So I thought that the problem could come from some parameter avoiding public keys without passphrase and I created a new publickey/privatekey couple with a passphrase. But still, I get the following message :
    Failing ssh to localhost : Permission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive).

For information, I created the key couple with the command :
    ssh-keygen -t dsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa

After having done some researches, I've read that wrong permissions can cause problems, so here is the result of the command ls -lha ~/.ssh/ :
    drwx------   7 matthieu  staff  238B 22 mai 17:50 .

"37377207","Unable to ssh localhost on Mac OS El Capitan","I am having some troubles while trying to make a ssh localhost connexion. I want to do this without passphrase, so when I created the public key/private key couple, I typed on the return key when asked for the passphrase, as indicated.
When I try the command
    ssh localhost

I still get asked for a password. So I thought that the problem could come from some parameter avoiding public keys without passphrase and I created a new publickey/privatekey couple with a passphrase. But still, I get the following message :
    Failing ssh to localhost : Permission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive).

For information, I created the key couple with the command :
    ssh-keygen -t dsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa

After having done some researches, I've read that wrong permissions can cause problems, so here is the result of the command ls -lha ~/.ssh/ :

Having a friend who has got the same laptop as me (last mbp Retina 13""), with whom ssh localhost works fine, I noted that he's got the additional lines at the beginning when executing ssh -vvv localhost :

    debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 21: Applying options for *

For the record, I already checked these pages and tried what's proposed, without success : 
SSH: "Bad passphrase" after generation of public key
and 
ssh: Permission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive)
Thanks in advance for any advice, idea or solution
","You may try to use specific key for authorization:
ssh localhost -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa

If succeed, then you can add it to ssh config file at ~/.ssh/config. 
If such a file is not existed, just create on via touch or vi.
The config should be something like below, please revise it accordingly:
Host localhost
    HostName 127.0.0.1
    Port 22
    user matthieu
    IdentityFile  ~/.ssh/id_dsa

If I generate my keys in this way, should the password be the SAME as the passphrase for the PRIVATE KEY?
Do I distribute the X.509 certificate to prove the PUBLIC KEY is mine (being paired to my name in the certificate) or should the certificate be kept as safe and secret as the PRIVATE KEY and what use is a self-signed certificate?

","Certificate is actually the block of information which binds your identity (i.e. your name, email, whatever else) to some public key. It is public so everyone can know that this key belongs to you.
So when you will sign something they will know that actually you signed this. 
The other thing is validating certificate - that's for what trusted root certificates are used.
Private key is your own secret information, and MUST be kept secret.

","A PKCS#12 file can contain both the certificate and the private key.  They are, however, stored as separate, distinct objects.  The certificate itself has the public key embedded within it.  Since the certificate only contains the public key, it is considered ""public"" as well.  You can feel free to distribute the certificate, as it does not contain the private key, which should be kept confidential.  This is the basis of the security in asymmetric cryptography.
Because a PKCS#12 file contains both items, it is encrypted with a password to protect the private key within it.  That said, you would use the private key to prove that the certificate you distribute belongs to you.  For example, through the use of a digital signature on a document.
Hope that helps!

","Do not use as salt the user email because it can be guessed.Instead of doing it yourself with a risk of error use a library instead.
I suggest you to use this PHP library https://github.com/IcyApril/CryptoLib (like proposed in this post :Generating cryptographically secure tokens). This library enables you to generate a random string then to hash it using a salt by exposing very practical methods : 
This example (provided by the documentation that you can find here : https://cryptolib.ju.je/#intro) generate a salt to hash a token, that you can provide to your user as a key :
<?php
// Require the library
require_once('path/to/cryptolib.php');
// Generate a token of 16 char with the library by calling the randomString method.
$token = CryptoLib::randomString(16);
// Generate a salt with the library by calling the generateSalt method
$salt = CryptoLib::generateSalt();
// Hash the token with the salt that was generated
$hash = CryptoLib::hash($token, $salt);

// Salt and hash are then stored in the database.

// $hash and $salt are gotten later from the database, and the token is provided via a POST variable by the user
$isHashCorrect = CryptoLib::validateHash($hash, $_POST['token']);

// If isHashCorrect is true, the user has provided the correct token.

I think the connection works, because I get an empty output and not an error message. I know that I have to use a keyfile to connect really on the device. Maybe that's the reason why the output is empty.
This is my code:
mykey = os.path.expanduser('C:\\Users\\taaiaal1\\PycharmProjects\\hal_dmms_application\\dev_ssh')
command = 'pcb_cli -u cwmpd pcb://ipc:[/var/run/IGD] -i \'?\''

I feel like checked every page google let me find and even in the subprocess python doc I couldn't find anything. Is this even possible? I'm using Python 3. 
","Some pointers:

First of all port is not given after :, It it given with -p option
If key is required then you have to specify it using -i option. Make sure permissions on the key are 0400.
You are giving remote command as a list and also giving shell=True these are in a way mutually exclusive options. If you want use shell=True then you give command as a single string.
If want to collect output of a remote command simply use subprocess.check_output. It uses popen() function inernally but gives you simpler interface. Don't forget try/except around the function as it raises exception if something went wrong with ssh itself or the remote command's exit status is non-zero.

Your code may look like:
try:
    out = subprocess.check_ouptput([""ssh"", ""-i"", ""<path to your key>"", ""-p"", ""<port number>"", ""{}@{}"".format(user, host), command])
    print(out)
except CalledProcessError as e:
...

Look at my implementation of executing remote commands if you want to see some of the good practices for executing remote commands.
PS: There are two different ways of using subprocess functions: one which require a shell to execute your command for eg if the remote command has a wildcard(ls *.txt) OR your remote command does not require the shell for eg executing uname -a. Please look at the subprocess documentation link above.

And, as a damienfrancois mentioned, it shouldn't remember it past a reboot.
If you wished to extract the decrypted private keys from ssh-agent itself, you would have to find a tool written to search the memory of the running process and locate keys. One such tool can be found here, but you may well find it very challenging to use.
For a more practical answer, you can just delete your keys from ~/.ssh/id*, make new ones that you know the passphrase for, and move on - for a new machine, you probably haven't gotten too reliant on them yet.

","I presume you're talking about java.security.KeyStore. This abstraction requires that each stored PrivateKey has a corresponding chain of Certificate instances (one or more certificate). This means you should be able to create a KeyPair from a private key entry of KeyStore. For example, if the private key is stored under ""test"":
String alias = ""test"";
KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(...);
keyStore.load(...;);
PrivateKey privateKey = (PrivateKey) keyStore.getKey(alias, null);
PublicKey publicKey = keyStore.getCertificate(alias).getPublicKey();

I believe this has something to do with WinSCP not waiting for input.  I changed the echo option to 'on' so I could see my response and my response occures after WinSCP has already rejected the connection.

But that's just to get the key from the end device since I can scan the outputs from winscp and find a message that happens to show that lovely key.  So then, now knowing my device's RSA key I can then prompt the user: 'You're CPU dosn't know this device... Connect anyways?' [yes/no/cancel].  If they say yes then I can explicitly give winscp the hostkey I'm looking for and connect,
winscp.StandardInput.WriteLine(open scp://name:pass@xx.xx.xx.xx -hostkey: *****);

Like I said it's not the prettiest, and I'd like to do it with a single connection attempt.  But whatever gets the job done right?  I'm still looking into this for a better option.

","AES256 is a specific symmetric encryption scheme, which requires the communicating parties to have pre-shared an encryption key. Public-key cryptography on the other hand is an asymmetric encryption principle, where each communicating party has a public key shared with every one and a private key which he keeps a secret. A typical example for the latter would be RSA.
Both symmetric and asymmetric encryption have there pros and cons, you should first figure out what you (or your client) want. Then, when implementing any cryptography always be sure to use common libraries and never (ever) try to implement any cryptography algorithms yourself.

Since these functions use random numbers you should ensure that the random number generator is appropriately seeded

But nowhere on EVP_PKEY_keygen does it make mention of seeding a random number generator. It only discusses the low-level doc pages for non-EVP functions for generating keys.
I have also searched and everywhere no mention is made of seeding when the EVP functions are used.
So my question is; May I assume that the seeding is done internally for me in the higher-level EVP functions?

","
but nowhere on https://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/EVP_PKEY_keygen.html it makes any mention of seeding a random number generator....

See the OpenSSL wiki page Random Numbers. It takes you through it in grueling detail.


... no mention is made of seeding when the EVP functions are used

The EVP functions use whatever generator is in use for the library. It could be md_rand or a FIPS AES/CTR generator. There's nothing special to get random numbers for the EVP functions (as opposed to other functions).


May I assume that the seeding is done internally for me in the higher-level EVP functions?

Yes, if you did not seed the generator yourself. If you seeded the generator and there's sufficient entropy, then it will not auto-seed itself.
You should avoid allowing the generator to auto-seed itself. See the OpenSSL wiki page Random Numbers for the details.
There's nothing special about seeding/auto-seeding a generator when using EVP interfaces. Whatever you do applies to everything.


If I do need to do it then which functions must I have a look at?

The OpenSSL wiki page Random Numbers provides more details, but you should do something like:
int rc = RAND_load_file(""/dev/urandom"", 32);
if(rc != 32) {
    /* RAND_load_file failed */
}

/* OK to proceed */

You want to avoid a direct call to RAND_poll, and you want to avoid auto-seeding (which calls RAND_poll internally).

I am able to connect to the server without the fingerprint. Is there any way to match the fingerprint that I have with the servers' before making the connection?
Following is my C# code for the connection:
string _ftpURL = ""ftp.com""; //Host URL or address of the SFTP server
string _UserName = ""Login_Id"";      //User Name of the SFTP server
string _Password = ""12345"";   //Password of the SFTP server

string _ftpDirectory = ""ReceivedFiles""; //The directory in SFTP server where the files will be uploaded
string LocalDirectory = ""D:\\FilePuller""; //Local directory from where the files will be uploaded

ArrayList UploadedFiles = new ArrayList();

Sftp oSftp = new Sftp(_ftpURL, _UserName, _Password);

oSftp.Connect(_Port);

Is there anyway I can add a check for Server's fingerprint before connecting to the SFTP Server?
","The SharpSSH is stupid enough not to verify the host keys by default.
You would have to re-implement SshBase.ConnectSession not to set StrictHostKeyChecking to no.

And then use JSch.getHostKeyRepository().add() to configure expected host key (or implement HostKeyRepository interface).
Or implement UserInfo interface, particularly the promptYesNo method.

Is it expected to be used only as a 'encrypt this' command that will 'seal' something

I just want to be sure your phrasing is not to be interpreted in this second way
your phrase 'decrypt any data' sounds dangerous
(and not-feasible/practical with asymmetric key encryption)



Update based on the comment. 

You are planning for two copies of the data each encrypted with different keys


one copy is to be encrypted with the master public key


can be decrypted with anyone having the master private key
the master private key must then be secured (public key is not critical)

the second copy is to be encrypted with the Rijndael 256 key

purpose is to allow the master to decrypt the data whenever required
particularly, in the absence of the individual who encrypted it

This approach will work for,
easy access of the data by the individual with the Rijndael key,
without need for intervention by the master private key owner.
And, when the master private key owner is trusted with the secrecy of the data.  
Your scheme will need to update the master copy (deleting the older one and re-encrypting a new one) every time the user updates their copy.

However, if the user data is trusted with the master (as is clearly the case here),  

an easier approach would be to issue the Rijndael key from the master
The master could keep it encrypted with the master-public key itself
The data can then be encrypted with just the issued Rijndael key 


it will always be accessible with the master-private key
which can open the user's Rijndael key 


If the user needs to sign the data, that can be accomplished separately in the process.
It will save you from keeping double copies and maintaining them.

To sign the data, the user could have a a key pair generated by them.  

Before encrypting the data with the Rijndael private-key
the master-public key encrypted with the user-private-key can be appended to it
the user-public key shared with the master (at least)
will be sufficient to authenticate that the user has provided the data
In a worst-case scenario, if the user is unavailable and the key confirmation fails,
the master may be trusted on the authenticity of the data -- which can still be decrypted

","I don't see how that would work.  Any two-way encryption function is only going to decrypt when fed the specific password used to encrypt (unless you're the NSA and you put back doors in the algorithms).  You can't have two passwords decrypt the same file (unless there are hash collisions, but that's not something you can make happen easily).
As far as storing your master password in the program, it would be much better to store it in a separate file the program reads in, so you can use tighter OS-level security on that file.
Keep in mind mcrypt is not public key cryptography.  With public key cryptography, you might be able to do what you want, though.  For instance, with PGP/GPG, you can encrypt a file such that three different users can decrypt it using their private keys, without knowing each other's private keys.  So you can have a virtual user with the master password that can decrypt everything.
Another option would be to hold two copies of all encrypted data; one encrypted with the user's password, and one encrypted with the master password.

Can anyone explain this behaviour?
","That is expected.
The RSA cryptosystem works in group modulo some prime number. To ensure that all possible plaintexts are encrypted with the same security, the plaintexts are padded to produce a padded plaintext that is slightly smaller than the modulus. Since the padding is applied before encryption, the ciphertext looks completely different.
JSEncrypt is based on JSBN which in turn implements only PKCS#1 v1.5 padding type 2 (RFC 2313). The second type of this padding introduces random bytes that are removed after decryption because of marker bytes. At least 11 bytes are needed for the padding.
If you want to check the interoperability with other implementations, you need to do a full encryption-decryption cycle and make sure that you get the same plaintext back.
Note that nowadays, PKCS#1 v1.5 padding shouldn't be used anymore and PKCS#1 v.2 OAEP is preferred which is also randomized.

Yes.

You might try a bit of searching for a python rsa library.
However, if you're planning on doing this on the client side, then realize in order for the client program to decrypt the data, it will have to have a decryption key. If the client program has the decryption key, then anyone with a text editor also has the decryption key (and the code to decrypt it). 
If you really meant RSA encryption, take a look at PyCrypto.

Basically, I'm renting a dedicated server running CentOS 7 and so just trying to configure security. It's been a couple of years since I used any SSH and even then it was basic but I'm fumbling my way through.
I open up the SSH connection with Putty logging in as the root user.
Created a new user, given a password and added it to the wheel group.
Then I have created, on my local machine, a public key using ssh-keygen from git for windows.
I added a password to the key when it asked me, again for verification.
Then I transferred the key over to the new user on the server, ran chmod on it and then altered the SSH daemon to not allow root log in.
I reloaded the sshd and tried a new connection. It doesn't let me log in as root, and it does as the new user, and it seems to have the correct privileges. 
The question is, how do I know, when logging on, that it is checking the key and do you have any idea why it isn't asking me for the password for the key?
Any info would be appreciated.

","If you perform padding, cipher text should have fixed size equal to RSA public key modulus. If you get different size every time, then there is something with your program.
When you perform encryption data must be less than RSA_size(rsa) - 11 and encrypted must point to RSA_size(rsa) bytes of memory.
strlen(const char * str) computes length of null-terminated string. encrypt is not the string and is not null terminated, so using strlen is not valid here. Luckily for you PKCS#1 padding contains zero bytes, so you don't get segmentation fault.
On the other hand myData is a null terminated string. However, you use RSA_size(rsaPub) - 11 as its length, which will result in occasional segmentation faults.

","This is not really hard. However I suggest to write a callback based ssh server. See the samplesshd-cb.c example in the libssh source code.
Public key auth:
First read RFC 4252 section 7. It describes how public key auth works. The callback provides you the public key and tells you if it is a probe of the public key or a login.
So first you have to read the authorized keys. Normally you have a file with all the keys in it. You use ssh_pki_import_pubkey_base64() to read the key and then call ssh_key_cmp() to compare it with the public key sent by the client. Depending if it is a probe you return partial success or auth success if it is a login.

So I am guessing is has to be some sort of difference between my laptop and the server.  I have verified that both are running basically the same version of Java (""1.7.0_17"").  I also checked the provider of the KeyFactory and they are the same as well. So where do I look from here?

That way we do not have to keep replacing the certificate overtime it expires, thus not having to build a new IPA or submit to Apple.

The server itself does not need to do anything special but your ops/infrastructure team does; see 2. and the backup pin.
TrustKit provides a Python script to generate the hash and algorithm you're looking for : https://github.com/datatheorem/TrustKit/blob/master/get_pin_from_certificate.py . You need use the script on your domain's CA certificate (this will be the first hash), and then on another CA certificate, from which you bought a backup certificate for your domain. This backup pin is needed in case you need to quickly rotate the (first) certificate on your server, without bricking your App. This is explained in more details here: https://noncombatant.org/2015/05/01/about-http-public-key-pinning/ .
The script described in 2. also returns the algorithm. It is the algorithm (RSA, ECDSA) of the public key that's embedded in the server certificate. This is needed by TrustKit because iOS does not provide the APIs to automatically detect the certificate's algorithm.

I can also ""export"" these keys in PEM format and load them into a Python test script. Once in the Python script, I can use these keys to sign and verify some text using M2Crypto.
I have not yet been able to verify in Python the signature I created in Java.
Right now I am just trying to get cross-platform signing and verifying to work.
Here is Java snippet:
Signature sig = Signature.getInstance(""MD5WithRSA"");
sig.initSign(key.getPrivate());
sig.update(""This is a message."".getBytes(""UTF8""));

Then in Python the key is loaded and the signature is attempted to be verified:
from M2Crypto import RSA, EVP
pub_key = RSA.load_pub_key('public_key.pem')
verify_evp = EVP.PKey()
verify_evp.assign_rsa(pub_key)
verify_evp.verify_init()
verify_evp.verify_update(""This is a message."")
if verify_evp.verify_final(sig_string.decode('base64')) == 1:
    print ""Good""
else:
    print ""Bad""

And this does not verify. I suspect it is some leading or trailing characters or encoding weirdness that I don't understand.
I have no particular attachement to M2Crypto and have played a bit with the gdata.tlslite modules as well.
Please note that the keys are working, and that the text and signature above verify in Java, and the keys (public and private) can be used within Python to sign and verify text. The problem is somewhere in how Java-generated signature and/or the message text is getting into the Python code.
What am I doing wrong?
","M2Crypto.EVP defaults to 'sha1' (SHA1) and you're using MD5WithRSA. I think you should switch SHA1WithRSA (MD5 is a very weak algorithm).

https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Debian
Steps:

Open the URL path to the directory containing the desired CD image.  This directory will also contain the checksum files.  (eg. http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/8.3.0/amd64/iso-cd/ for Debian 8.3.0)
Download your CD image as well as the appropriate checksum and checksum signature.  (eg. SHA512SUMS and SHA512SUMS.sign)
Install the Debian keyring.  (sudo apt-get install debian-keyring)
Verify the checksum signature.  (gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-role-keys.gpg --verify SHA512SUMS.sign)  As long as ""gpg: Good signature"" is contained, you can ignore ""This key is not certified with a trusted signature!"" warnings.
Verify the CD image matches the checksum.  (sha512sum -c SHA512SUMS)  This must show ""debian-8.3.0-amd64-netinst.iso: OK"" or the equivalent for the CD image you downloaded.  All other images will have ""no such file"" warnings, that's fine.

If (and only if) your CD image checks out as OK, you have successfully verified your image!

Why these two public key are different?
I am curious about what are these two kind of public key data? 
Update:
Update public key field value from Chrome browser.
","I think what you may be seeing is that when you get the key from the browser, you're getting the whole ASN.1 raw key (denoted by the 30 82), but you're getting some watered down version from SSL_get_peer_certificate() and/or X509_get_pubkey() that has removed this header and just given you the rest of the key (without the leading30 82 01 0a 02 82 01 01 or trailing 02 03 01 00 01).  
I tried to look into what exactly x509_get_pubkey() returns, but didn't have much luck, but this is where I would start - researching why you're getting the raw key from the browser, but something truncated from the function.

","Simply create it and copy your key over to it. If you have a key-copy tool then just create the file via 
$ touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

before using the tool.
It might help to connect using -vvv for verbosity.
On the client and on the server, check that ~/.ssh has permissions 700.
On the server, check that /etc/ssh/sshd_config has:
AuthorizedKeysFile  .ssh/authorized_keys

","You may want to consider first adding the private key (or keys) to the authentication agent. From that point and on, all ssh commands will re-use the cached key:
# Add a new key to the authentication agent
$ ssh-add <path to private key>

# List current keys
$ ssh-add -l

# Delete all loaded keys
$ ssh-add -D

# Add a new key and store the passphrase in your keychain
$ ssh-add -K <path to private key1>
$ ssh-add -K <path to private key2>

# After storing the private keys passphrase in the keychain,
# you can load them all, at any time
$ ssh-add -k

When the authentication agent has a private key loaded, you should be able to use Xcode to connect to (domainname or IP) with no problems.

What I mean is, I need to send a CD to the end user with a script that can generate a CSR and a private key at their machine basing on my companies Publickey CA.

client can run an utility sent by me via some cd or DVD (May be an openSSL script) needs to accept some parameters so that end user can supply keyword/password data.
The script will generate private key and CSR back to my company via some secure way (may be through email, I know it is not safe but some how they send us back CSR)
We receive the CSR and we sign it and return to the client.

So I need to document this, so that the end user can understand what he is doing.
So my question is where can I get the script to send to client so that he can generate his own CSR and PrivateKey.

","The size of the certificate and a private key depends on algorithm, key length and additional information such as names of the issuer and subject, various URLs (for CRL and OCSP shecks etc) placed to the certificate.

My questions:

The application has to save the public key. Where should I store it?
How can I encrypt messages with this public key? I didn't find asymmetric encryption functions. (The application will encrypt symmetric key, and the data will be encrypted by the symmetric key)

By the way, I must use public key, because messages from the same sender should not be linked by the recipient.
References and examples to such a hybrid encryption, or even just to the use of public key encryption scheme (using KeyCzar or other recommended tools), will be appreciated.
","I'll answer your questions in order:

Where you store the key is up to you. Maybe you never want to update it. In that case you can store it as a resource or even ""hard coded"". In that case you have to create an update to your application to update it. Public keys are public, so there is no need to keep them safe. On the other hand, you may want to add some code to check if your trust store is not altered. You could also use a Java keystore like JKS, but in that case you need to create a certificate chain. Just sending them to the application is not a good idea; you need a secure path to avoid Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
Asymmetric encryption with RSA is certainly defined in the PKCS#1 standards (implemented in the Sun provider, using Cipher in Java. There are two schemes defined, the PKCS#1 v1.5 scheme and OAEP. The latter is more safe.

","For the sake of Humankind while working with MariaDB driver - debugging it
I find out that: 
The property should be ""serverSslCert"" or ""trustStore""
The prefix of javax.net.ssl  only required when working with System.setProperty
So this simple change did the trick.
    Properties p = new Properties();
    p.setProperty(""serverSslCert"",""C:/temp/amazonPublic.pem"");
    p.setProperty(""trustStorePassword"",jdbcDetails.getSensitiveData());

int PEM_write_RSAPublicKey(FILE *fp, RSA *x);
int PEM_write_RSA_PUBKEY(FILE *fp, RSA *x);

In the documentation i can see:

The RSAPublicKey functions process an RSA public key using an RSA
  structure. The public key is encoded using a PKCS#1 RSAPublicKey
  structure.
The RSA_PUBKEY functions also process an RSA public key using an RSA
  structure. However the public key is encoded using a
  SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure and an error occurs if the public key
  is not RSA

But i don't understand what is 

SubjectPublicKeyInfo

And what are the fundamentals differences between the 2 methods!
","SubjectPublicKeyInfo - ASN1 structure for public keys which is described in rfc 3280(Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure). This format in fact contains id of the public key algorithm and the public key itself. And in this case this public key is formatted according to the pkcs1 standard. So X.509 format is more high level format, it describes not just RSA public key but public key in general.

I am assuming RSA for the keys generation, encryption and decryption but if it's easier to do with another scheme feel free to comment.
","Hmm, interesting.
You're referring to RSA, I assume?
FYI, RSA isn't actually used to encrypt documents. It's used to exchange keys (keys for a symmetric algorithm, like AES).
So what you're really talking about is an approach that changes the keys.
Technically (mathmatically) if you put a different number in, you'll get a different number out. So that's not an issue; changing the public key in some fashion will (assuming you convince your RSA implementation to use it, or prepare an appropriately different number) result in a different symmetric key, thus an undecryptable document by Bob (because he'll expect a different key).
Really, though, I'm not so sure you care about this. It's a fairly useless thing to do. Perhaps, however, you're actually interested in Key Splitting (or ""Secret Sharing"" as wikipedia seems to call it).
HTH. I'm by no means an expert.

","As silky implies in his answer, the way in which RSA is usually used to encrypt a document is in combination with a symmetric algorithm, like AES.  A secure random key is generated for the AES algorithm, the documented is encrypted with that AES key, and the AES key is encrypted with the recipient's public key.  Both parts are supplied to the recipient.
You can adapt this to your situation simply by sending only the document encrypted with the AES key in the first step, and withholding the AES key encrypted with the recipient's public key until the second step.  The first part will be on the order of the original file size, and the second part will be a small, constant size (on the order of the RSA key size).

","(I assume you talk about RSA.)
Yes it is possible, but not 100%.
The public key is a part of the private key. It contains the modulus and the exponent of the key. 
You can completely forget changing the modulus, because you would have to generate a new rsa keypair, which is the same problem as the one we are trying to solve.
But it is possible to change the exponent. You can select any (prime) number between 1 and your exponent as the new exponent and hope that it is coprime with the totient. Without knowing the totient it's impossible to select always a correct exponent. To find out the totient you would have to know the prime factors of the key, which means that you would have to break the key (have fun!).
So, it's actually impossible to have a 100% percent working method to do that, at least not while knowing only the public key.

","I hope my idea works. 
Let us assume that (e,d,n) is a tuple of the RSA public exponent. The RSA private exponent and the RSA modulus n :
Select a prime number, say p,  between 1 and a 256 bit integer.
To encrypt a message m, compute the new public exponent as e*p and the ciphertext as: 
c= m^{e*p} mod n. 
To decrypt, the receiver should know the prime p, so you send this p later to him, with this he computes 
(1) P = p^{-1} mod phi(n)
and
(2) m^e=c^{P} mod n 
and 
finally m=(m^e)^d mod n. This works as the receiver knows phi(n).

You can also pipe the output into the openssl x509 -pubkey to get the public key itself.

","I'm having the same problem for decryption, using both MSCAPI and PKCS#11. I found that the P11RSAChiper implemented in SunPKCS11 doesn't regard the wrap/unwrap methods, and it uses encrypt/decrypt for this purpose, which in my case conflicts with underlying layer of security, where the private key is marked just for unwrap by the SmartCard profile.

","Cookies are sent in each request. This is really really bad because you want the private key to not sent over the network as much as possible.
Assuming you can't have local storage (IE7), the only way I know to store info on the cient side is cookies. I'd say : use local storage as much as possible, and when you can't, store the private key on the server side. At least, you'll be sending it once. it's bad, but less than really really bad ...
Or maybe you could store cookies on a dedicated subdomain that you never use again, but in order to read the cookie, even on the client side with javascript, you need to be on a page of that subdomain, and that means sending the key over the network again everytime you want to use it.

","The main problem is  that cookies are only meant for things you are sending to the server. They are not meant for storage and you should not be sending your private key anywhere, ever.
Cookies can be stolen via XSS (always assume you have an XSS vuln in your site) and the attacker can then try to decrypt it.
On the grand scale of things you could do a lot worse. Assuming your crypto is solid, the private key is probably safe, but the big issue is that you shouldn't be using cookies like this. Using Web Storage is probably a far better solution here.

","I´d say that saving your private key in a cookies isn´t a really good choice since they are not supposed to hold sensitive information due security reasons, and our colleagues already told other reasons.
It´s also important to notice that the user may clear all his cookies at any given time or disable it at all.

At first I only had one hash but I added a second one just in case this would be required. What am I doing wrong?
Note: Of course I have mod_header enabled and loaded.
","Two hashes are required and they must be two independent hashes. I.e. You cannot pin the cert and the intermediate cert that issued that as they are not independent. This is a safety feature to ensure you have a backup incase you need it.
Additionally a policy will only be accepted if it passes so you cannot put in a fake policy and watch it fail because it will never be accepted.
A good tool to check your policy is this one: https://report-uri.io/home/pkp_analyse
And also other tools on same site to actually generate your policy:
https://report-uri.io/home/pkp_hash
However you need to be VERY careful with HPKP. It's very easy to block your website and, hope you don't take this the wrong way, it doesn't sound like you fully understand HPKP so I would suggest you read about it some more first.
There is a Public-Key-Pins-Report-Only (which is only available in Chrome at present) , and which allows you to test a policy for a bit (well in Chrome at least) but for that you also need to use the report-uri option (you can also use above site to collect your reports if you don't want to write your own service for this).
I've an active interest in this and, if people don't mind me linking here, I've blogged about it in much more detail here: https://www.tunetheweb.com/security/http-security-headers/hpkp/. I think it's potentially a very dangerous option that needs careful consideration before implementing.

","It in fact worked... my mistake was the way I tested it.
So here's the most important thing I missed out:

You need at least one backup pin
If you test it don't change the hash in the header but either the SSL-Certificate or (better) try changing the hash saved locally. Or thanks for BazzaDP for pointing it out try using https://report-uri.io/home/pkp_analyse.

Please read BazzaDP's answer if you are new to HPKP and want to get started with it. Mozilla also has some good documentation.

"14519752","Python official keyserver","I have just downloaded the Python 2.7.3 64-bit installer from the Python download page and I would like to verify the signatures. So I need to import the keys and my preferred method is to get them from a trusted key server.
The method suggested in the Python documentation is using gpg from the command line with
gpg --recv-keys EA5BBD71 6A45C816 ED9D77D5 7D9DC8D2 A4135B38 36580288

However, no key server is indicated and I cannot find any information (even on google) about a key server (--keyserver option) providing these keys. The command as it is does not work: it connects to the default server keys.gnupg.net and exits with errors
gpgkeys: key ... not found on keyserver

Does anybody know where I can find a keyserver providing the official Python gpg keys?
","That specific key server works for me, with or without a 0x prefix:
gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 0xEA5BBD71 0x6A45C816 0xED9D77D5 0x7D9DC8D2 0xA4135B38 0x36580288

On most keyservers I tried, in fact, the keys are present; my setup uses wwwkeys.pgp.net:
gpg --keyserver wwwkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys EA5BBD71 6A45C816 ED9D77D5 7D9DC8D2 A4135B38 36580288

Alternatively you'd have to manually download the 7D9DC8D2 key (Martin von Löwis), used for signing the Windows builds and import that manually:
curl -o 7D9DC8D2.txt ""http://keys.gnupg.net/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x6AF053F07D9DC8D2""

","You have:
jsch.addIdentity(publicKey);

JSch javadoc says:

public void addIdentity(String prvkey) 
                 throws JSchException;
Adds an identity to be used for public-key authentication. Before registering it into identityRepository, it will be deciphered with passphrase.
Parameters:

prvkey - the file name of the private key file. This is also used as the identifying name of the key. The corresponding public key is assumed to be in a file with the same name with suffix .pub.


You have supplied the public key, when JSch wants the private key.
If you think about it, this makes sense. There's nothing secret about a public key. JSch wants a secret, so it can prove who you are.
Your private key is probably in ~/.ssh/id_rsa (without the .pub extension).
You may need to use the two-parameter version of addIdentity, in order to supply a passphrase to decrypt the private key.

","OpenSSH public key files (id_*.pub also the entries in known_hosts and authorized_keys) for SSH2 use an OpenSSH-specific variant of an SSH-specific format, see rfc4716 which is in turn based on the SSH2 wire format (as linked) rfc4253 6.6, which is not the 'X.509' format Java crypto uses. (OpenSSH file formats for SSH1 were different, but SSH1 is long broken and should not be used.)
To convert this in Java see convert openSSH rsa key to javax.crypto.Cipher compatible format .
It's easier to avoid the problem. 
Bypass 1: If you have reasonably recent OpenSSH (6.0 is okay, not sure for earlier), use
ssh-keygen -e -m PKCS8 -f id_rsa.pub >pub.pem # change filename as needed

to convert to 'X.509' (really SubjectPublicKeyInfo aka SPKI) in PEM form. (Yes they do use the name PKCS8 to mean SPKI; it's crazy.) Then read this in Java by discarding the BEGIN and END lines, decode everything in between (less the line breaks) from base64 to byte[], and put that in X509EncodedKeySpec as you have now. Or if you have OpenSSL you can convert to DER form 
openssl rsa -pubin -in pub.pem -out pub.der -outform der # any version
openssl pkey -pubin -in pub.pem -out pub.der -outform der # 1.0.0 up

and then read the DER file with no change at all into an X509EncodedKeySpec.
Bypass 2: if you have the private key, and it is NOT OpenSSH's 'new' format (optional since 6.5 (edit) and default since 7.8), and you have OpenSSL, get the public key in SPKI (Java-friendly) format with one of
openssl rsa -in id_rsa -pubout -out pub.pem # default PEM
openssl rsa -in id_rsa -pubout -out pub.der -outform der # DER
openssl pkey -in id_rsa -pubout -out pub.pem # default PEM, 1.0.0 up
openssl pkey -in id_rsa -pubout -out pub.der -outform der # DER, 1.0.0

FIRST PROBLEM
The first problem I am facing is accepting RSA key automatically, whitch I can do running
echo y |plink.exe -ssh -N -D 9999 user@1.2.3.4 -pw user -v

but it turns out that I get an error when I use echo y | at Process p = Process.Start(psi); line where psi variable is ok. I know how to put arguments after with Arguments = String.Format(""-ssh -N -D 9999 user@1.2.3.4 -pw user -v""), but i don't know how to put them in front of the command.
SECOND PROBLEM

","Obviously it is not possible to do io redirection with echo in your scenario.
Try to send the y to plink using the strw.WriteLine(...);  you already have in place or create a yes.txt file in which you put a single y and have plink read its content with plink < yes.txt.
A quick scan of plinks manual page showed no parameter that enables you to specify an ""all-yes mode"".

To verify an SSH host key, use the -hostkey switch. Do not try to skip the host key verification. It's there to protect you from man-in-the-middle attacks.
Arguments = String.Format(""-ssh -N -D 9999 user@1.2.3.4 -pw user -v -hostkey aa:bb:cc:dd:...""),

Anyway, your piping syntax does not work on its own, because it's cmd.exe that understands it only, so you would have to run it like:
ProcessStartInfo psi = new ProcessStartInfo(""cmd.exe"")
{
    Arguments = String.Format(""/C echo y | C:\\plink\\plink.exe -ssh -N -D 9999 user@1.2.3.4 -pw user -v""),
}

But again, do not do it!

i don't want to wait for the content 


So, do not wait.
We do not know, what you application purpose is.
If just to open the tunnel, then make it wait (for a key press?) indefinitely, to keep the tunnel open.
If the application is going to use the tunnel, then just carry on with the other tasks, without closing the SSH session.

You should better use a native .NET SSH library for the tunnel, then using an external application.
For example the SSH.NET. See .NET SSH Port Forwarding

I'm trying to export a public key from a x509certificate2 object in PEM format in c# code.
As far as I understand, the difference between a certificate in cer format vs pem format, is only the header and footer
(if I understand correctly, a certificate in .cer format in base 64 should be someBase64String and in pem format it's the same string including the begin and end header and footer).
but my question is for the public key.
let pubKey be a public key exported in .cer format from an x509certificate2 object,
is the pem format of this key, will be:
------BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
pubKey...
------END PUBLIC KEY------

encoded in base 64?
Thanks :)
","
for the public key. let pubKey be a public key exported in .cer format from an x509certificate2 object

Talking about a "".cer format"" only applies when you have the whole certificate; and that's all that an X509Certificate2 will export as. (Well, or a collection of certificates, or a collection of certificates with associated private keys).
Nothing built in to .NET will give you the DER-encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo block of the certificate, which is what becomes ""PUBLIC KEY"" under a PEM encoding.
You can build the data yourself, if you want.  For RSA it's not too bad, though not entirely pleasant.  The data format is defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3280#section-4.1:
SubjectPublicKeyInfo  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
    algorithm            AlgorithmIdentifier,
    subjectPublicKey     BIT STRING  }

AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
    algorithm               OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
    parameters              ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL  }

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3279#section-2.3.1 describes how RSA keys, in particular are to be encoded:

The rsaEncryption OID is intended to be used in the algorithm field
     of a value of type AlgorithmIdentifier.  The parameters field MUST
     have ASN.1 type NULL for this algorithm identifier.
The RSA public key MUST be encoded using the ASN.1 type RSAPublicKey:
RSAPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
    modulus            INTEGER,    -- n
    publicExponent     INTEGER  }  -- e


The language behind these structures is ASN.1, defined by ITU X.680, and the way they get encoded to bytes is covered by the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) ruleset of ITU X.690.
.NET actually gives you back a lot of these pieces, but you have to assemble them:
private static string BuildPublicKeyPem(X509Certificate2 cert)

    }

    }

    {

        (byte)length,
    };
}

DSA and ECDSA keys have more complex values for AlgorithmIdentifier.parameters, but X509Certificate's GetKeyAlgorithmParameters() happens to give them back correctly formatted, so you would just need to write down their OID (string) lookup key and their OID (byte[]) encoded value in the switch statement.
My SEQUENCE and BIT STRING builders can definitely be more efficient (oh, look at all those poor arrays), but this would suffice for something that isn't perf-critical.
To check your results, you can paste the output to openssl rsa -pubin -text -noout, and if it prints anything other than an error you've made a legally encoded ""PUBLIC KEY"" encoding for an RSA key.

docker run --name=gogs -p 10022:22 -p 10080:3000 -v /var/gogs:/data gogs/gogs-rpi

I used my laptop to register an admin user via the gogs webinterface and added a public key to the account. I can now clone git repositories from the pi to my laptop using this command:
git clone ssh://git@192.168.178.50:10022/peter/my_repo.git

I enter the key-phrase and it works just fine.
Now the strange part... When I delete the public key file (id_rsa_gogs.pub) from my laptop and run the above command again I will get an 'access denied' error.
Does anyone know what that could be? I already registered the public key in Gogs. Why do I need to have a version of the public key on the client machine? I never heard of a case in which the public key needs to stay with the client.

docker run --name=gogs -p 10022:22 -p 10080:3000 -v /var/gogs:/data gogs/gogs-rpi

I used my laptop to register an admin user via the gogs webinterface and added a public key to the account. I can now clone git repositories from the pi to my laptop using this command:

Now the strange part... When I delete the public key file (id_rsa_gogs.pub) from my laptop and run the above command again I will get an 'access denied' error.
Does anyone know what that could be? I already registered the public key in Gogs. Why do I need to have a version of the public key on the client machine? I never heard of a case in which the public key needs to stay with the client.

    User Peter

ssh doesn't accept a port number as part of either the Host or Hostname options here. As a result, it's not recognizing that this entry should apply to your connection attempts, and it's not applying the identity file or user.
If you just need to match the IP address, this should work:
Host 192.168.178.50
    Port 10022
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_gogs
    User Peter

If you really need to match on the port, this should work:
Match host 192.168.178.50 exec ""test %p = 10022""
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_gogs
    User Peter

This runs the test command to test the port value. ""%p"" will be replaced by the port value that ssh would use up to that point (either the default of 22 or the value from the command line). test is also known as [; it's a command-line utility mostly used in shell scripts as part of an if statement.

Now, for configuring in the server side (authorized_keys), public key has to be in the RFC-4716 format.
Usually as a practice, for getting this key, ssh-keygen is typically used with options as,
ssh-keygen -y -f private_key.pem

which returns the corresponding public key(RFC-4716) that has to be configured in the server side.
Without ssh-keygen, Is there a possibility in openssl itself to generate the RFC-4716 specific public key from the openssl generated public (or) private key?

"24869722","What's the simplest way to distribute an RSA public key with software?","I'm working on some software that exchanges XML documents with a server. The server signs the XML using XMLDSIG and the client should verify the signature before trusting the XML. I'm using RSACryptoServiceProvider to do this. The XML is signed, but not encrypted.
I'm following the basic procedure explained in:
How to Sign XML Documents with Digital Signatures
How to Verify the Digital Signatures of XML Documents 
This requires that the client software has the public key available. I want the distribution of the client software to be as simple as possible and I don't want the client to have to deal with certificates. The pair of documents referenced above conveniently skirt around the subject of distributing the public key, simply stating that the user ""needs to have the same key"". I don't particularly want the end user to even be aware that they have a public key, so asking them to mess around with certificates is out of the question. Since the public key is public, what I would like to do is somehow embed it within the client software. As I see it, my options are:

Install the public key during the setup process
Somehow embed the public key into the software itself, possibly within the App.config file

Is this feasible in practice? What is the simplest way of achieving this that doesn't require any user interaction or awareness?

"24869722","What's the simplest way to distribute an RSA public key with software?","I'm working on some software that exchanges XML documents with a server. The server signs the XML using XMLDSIG and the client should verify the signature before trusting the XML. I'm using RSACryptoServiceProvider to do this. The XML is signed, but not encrypted.
I'm following the basic procedure explained in:
How to Sign XML Documents with Digital Signatures
How to Verify the Digital Signatures of XML Documents 
This requires that the client software has the public key available. I want the distribution of the client software to be as simple as possible and I don't want the client to have to deal with certificates. The pair of documents referenced above conveniently skirt around the subject of distributing the public key, simply stating that the user ""needs to have the same key"". I don't particularly want the end user to even be aware that they have a public key, so asking them to mess around with certificates is out of the question. Since the public key is public, what I would like to do is somehow embed it within the client software. As I see it, my options are:

Install the public key during the setup process
Somehow embed the public key into the software itself, possibly within the App.config file

Is this feasible in practice? What is the simplest way of achieving this that doesn't require any user interaction or awareness?
","You don't have to distribute the certificate. One of common approaches is to include the certificate in the signed document, in the KeyInfo/X509Data node.
The validation can use the embedded certificate easily and the only required infrastructure element at the client side is the certificate thumbprint and subject name. In other words, client validates the document using included certificate and then easily checks the certificate agaist the subject name and thumbprint. In case of a match, there is the assumption that a correct certificate has been provided.
Read more about technical details in one of my blog entries (this is a 3 part tutorial so you can also take a look at all other entries). Anyway, no importing certificates and no including certificates with your software, rather you have two string configuration parameters.
The embedded certificate inside the XmlDsigned document has a const size and usually the overhead is neglectable.

This is my public and private key generated.
","The RSA private key includes the values that are in the RSA public key, and some more values that are private. Futhermore, the values themselves are larger.
The public key contains the modulus and the public exponent e which is short (mostly 3 or 65537). On the other hand the private key contains the private exponent d ≡ e−1 (mod φ(n)). Depending on φ(n), d can be vastly larger than e.
There are other public key algorithms where this is different. Some algorithms based on elliptic curves have a single big integer as the private key (and group description) and the public key has a curve point (and group description) which is larger than the big integer.

","
why private key are often (are always, i don't know) longer than public key ? 

The answer is detailed in PKCS 1 (and friends like RFC 2437).
The public key is the pair {e, n}, where e is the public exponent and n is the modulus.
One of the private key representations is the triplet {e, d, n}, where e is the public exponent, d is the private exponent and n is the modulus.
The other private key representations the n-tuple{e, d, n, p, q, dp, dq, qi}, where e is the public exponent; d is the private exponent; n is the modulus; and p and q are the factors of n.
And the remaining are for the Chinese Remainder theorem, which allows a speedup in signatures (I believe). dp is p's exponent, a positive integer such that e(dP) ≅ 1 (mod(p-1)); dq is q's exponent, a positive integer such that e(dq) ≅ 1 (mod(q-1)); and qi is CRT coefficient, a positive integer less than p such that q(qInv) ≅ 1 (mod p).

Could you please help me on this? 
","The problem is not Gitosis itself, but that your SSH key gets rejected. This can be because it has not been authorized (is not in gituser’s authorized_keys file), because your SSH server is configured not to accept public keys, because your SSH key is weak or because you are not sending one at all.
Have a look at the logs of your SSH server to see whether (and why) your public key is rejected. On Ubuntu, the file should be located at /var/log/auth.log. Look for the word publickey and/or try cloning your repository to see what happens in the log file. You can use something like sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log to watch new entries as they arrive.

This file is then stored inside a jar file which is then loaded by JBoss. I'm trying to read this file but it throws me an exception telling that it's not serializable. 
Here is the code :

Object obj = objectInputStream.readObject();
Key output = (Key) obj;

which throws me this exception 
An exception occurred: java.io.NotSerializableException
","I'm not sure about serialization/deserialization from within a jar file, but
without being able to see the rest of your code, I can say a few things:

make sure that all of the classes that you are trying to serialize/deserialize implement Serializable.
If you can't do number 1, then you might try getting an encoded form of the Key object, such as key.getEcnoded(), which would allow you to do input/output using the bytes of the key.

Edit:
I'm not really familiar with JBoss, but maybe try using JBossObjectInputStream and JBossObjectOutputStream (org.jboss.serial.io). You will also have to add jboss-serialization.jar to your classpath. see link
also, I've never done this sort of thing before, but if you think the jar file is complicating things, but you should be able to use some of the classes in the java.util.jar package to simplify IO operations with jar files.
I hope this helps in some way.

UPDATE: I replaced ECB with CBC and hope its correct...
","You are not getting the public key with openssl_pkey_get_details(). That structure contains both the public exponent e and private exponent d. It is normal that the private key also contains the public exponent. Most of the time that is a static value (such as 65537, the fourth number of Fermat).
According to the documentation of openssl_pkey_new you can get to the public key using the method openssl_pkey_new():

openssl_pkey_new() generates a new private and public key pair. The public component of the key can be obtained using openssl_pkey_get_public().

That's not the only thing that goes wrong though:

You are not using AES. Rijndael with a block size of 256 is not AES. AES has a block size of 128 bits.
Although mcrypt always expects an IV, ECB mode does not - but read on.
ECB mode is not secure for anything other than random data, you should be using CBC mode to encrypt asymmetric keys (as they almost always contain a structure that may leak information); CBC mode does require a random IV.
You are using the ASCII representation of a string instead of an AES key; you should use a Password Based Key Derivation function such as PBKDF2, bcrypt or scrypt instead. PHP mcrypt is far too forgiving regarding insecure keys.

Note that in general I would also advise a padding mode such as PKCS#7. Mcrypt however does not implement any sane padding method, so you would have to implement that yourself.

"10642989","What, if any ""screw it up permanently"" situations are there in the App Store certificate/key-pair code signing process?","My company works with several other companies to handle their iPhone development needs, and in many cases the other companies already have some existing app(s) on the App Store. 
We handle the App Store submission for them as well and in the situations where they do already have an existing app, their iOS Dev Center account already has a Distribution certificate created. In which case we have to acquire the key pair that was generated when they (or the third party developer they hired) created the certificate. It's been my understanding this whole time that this is the necessary process in order to work with the App Store. 
But as time goes on, I find myself wondering about several things

What happens when the certificates expire? I know we create new ones but that means that the apps on the App Store are signed with a certificate/keypair different than the one they were created with. Is that significant? Or can I still update existing apps on the App Store even with a new certificate/keypair (from the same iOS Dev Center account)
What happens if the the keypair is lost for an existing certificate? Let's say the company made an app before but the Macintosh that they used prior was hit by a meteorite. And no backups of course. I'd have to revoke and recreate the certificate - would that mean anything for the existing published app? If I had the source code to that app and had to put out an update, would I be able to? 

Basically I'm asking: are there any ""screw it up permanently"" scenarios involved with iOS development and distribution certificates that would keep you from being able to update existing apps? I know that if you don't backup the keystore in Android development then you're just hosed with regards to publishing updates but is there any way to just completely screw up with iOS development?
And a bonus question: If I can just revoke development certificates and re-issue them without consequence, has it always worked this way? Or have they modified the process? I can see where the ""chain of evidence"" could always be tied to the iOS Dev Center Agent account and that would be the root of things, but is this a new thing?
","A Distribution certificate is used only for submission to iTunes Connect (and Ad Hoc stuff).  Once approved, Apple signs the app with a different non-expiring certificate before putting the app in the App store, so the state of the developer's Distribution certificate no longer matters.  
A downloaded or purchased app will stay running on a customer's device even if the developer's certificates and iOS enrollment expires.  But a developer does have to re-enroll ($99/annum) in time if they want their app to stay visible in the App store.
Typically, Distribution certificates expire annually, maybe a bit more often, new ones can be created, and an updates for existing apps can just be submitted with the newest (and valid) Distribution certificate.
If you lose a key pair, the team leader will have to revoke and the generate new certificates and provisions, and update all their Keychains and Xcode provisioning and possibly project/target settings as well.  Confusion about which certificates and provisions are live and which are dead has caused some developers some serious headaches.

1- check on certificate as it is
2- check on public key of the certificate only
in my case, my app connect to a backend server all the time and when the user try to login the app should login on another server for some security issue, also this server may be changed according to user type
so my backend server sends to me some urls with server certificate public key string  for each login url server, and I have to check on the similarity of the key when the user login
also this app is done for iOS and Android,
My question can I get the public key (as a string) from the login server certificate to match it the stored one 
Also is that key will be similar to the one on the android?, so the back end server sends only one key for me and android ?
","As I understand,

There is a certificate stored in your APP.
You can store your public key in keychain and use it.  Use ""SecItemAdd"" to add certificate to your application keychain. Once stored, you should be able to copy the Public key using ""SecItemCopyMatching"" method.
When the user logs in, The app gets a URL to new certificate.
If the certificate is different then you need to download and use the new certificate.
For point 2 and 3, either ways we would need the key data to be downloaded. So, download the certificate every time, retrieve the public key. We cannot do a string compare, however it should be possible to do a byte comparison to check for equality. If not equal, replace the certificate with downloaded one using, ""SecItemUpdate"".
Will this be same on iOS and Android?
I hope the certificates are used for secure transmission/PKI. So, the same public key would work for iOS and android.

"39471872","JWT RS256: Is it safe to fetch public key over https?","I'm signing JWT's using the RS256 algorithm. To verify those tokens on the client, I somehow need to access the public key.
Are there security concerns (spoofing, ...) when I set up an unprotected API route ('/api/certificate') that returns the certificate containing the public key. And do I need to take any extra security measurements?
","Several concepts are often mixed up, maybe not for you, but let me try to explain a few things in this answer.
Assymetric cryptography obviously needs a public and a private key, both are basically just numbers. The private key is kept secret, the public is, well, public, anybody can have it. When signing stuff, you use the private key to sign and then anybody can verify using the public key that the signature was made by somebody that had the corresponding private key (ie. you).
But the question is then how you distribute your public key, or in your jwt example, how clients get it. As you correctly pointed out in the question, simply downloading the public key over an insecure channel is not good enough as an attacker could replace it with his own, resulting in the attacker being able to sign tokens.
One solution to this could be getting it over https as you proposed, which practically means using a second set of public-private keypair (keys of the webserver) to secure sending the first one. The theoretical question is still the same btw, it's just inherently solved in the background for you: how does the browser know that the public key it receives from the server upon connection actually belongs to the server. There is no secure channel yet between them.
Enter certificates.
A certificate is a document that essentially ties a public key to its owner, and that is excactly what you want. When a browser connects to a website, the server sends its public key along with its certificate, so that the browser can verify that the public key actually belongs to the server (the domain name in this case) that sent it. How that verifies it is beyond the scope of this post, the point is that the certificate is signed by another public key, the certificate to which may be signed by another public key, etc., and the chain is terminated by a list of so called trusted root certificates already set up for your computer and/or browser by your OS/browser vendor.
And you too should verify the public key with the certificate the same way. You don't even need the burden of SSL (https) transport for this, verifying that a public key belongs to a particular subject is the main purpose of certificates.
So all you have to do is not just get the public key from the API, but get it along with its certificate. You are probably already doing this, bare public keys are very rarely used. You are most probably already receiving a pfx or cer or crt or whatever from the server. Depending on the technology stack that you are developing on, you can for sure use built in mechanisms to fully verify a certificate and make sure it's valid. Please don't implement your own validation though, as that's tricky business and quite hard to get right. If the certificate passes validation, you can trust that the public key you received from the API is authentic and belongs to whatever it claims to belong to. There may be caveats though (like for example make sure that beyond basic validation, you check a combination of fields from the certificate that others can't have).
As an additional security measure, you can also implement certificate pinning to make it even more secure against certain types of attacks by having a list of fingerprints for valid certificates in the client (less so in a browser client, but still the concept is the same).
Edit (what fields to check in the certificate after it passed general validation of expiry, etc):
In the general case it depends on who signed the certificate and what kind of certificate it is.
A server certificate signed by a real certificate authority (CA) can only have the server domain as its common name (CN) field, a real CA won't normally sign anything else, and they also won't sign a certificate for yourdomain.com unless you can prove you control yourdomain.com. So in this case it may be enough to check CN after the cert passed validation. You do need to check CN though, as anybody can have a valid certificate from say GlobalSign or Thawte or other trusted CAs, it just costs money. What they can't have is a certificate for yourdomain.com.
If you sign your own certificates, you also won't sign anything for anyone, so in that case it could be enough to check the issuer (that you signed it) and the CN (for whom). If the certificate otherwise passed validation (meaning a trusted root certificate signed it) it should be ok, as an attacker won't normally be able to have his CA certificate as trusted on your computer.
The point in general is that you want to check something that others can't have. It's easier, if you are relying on real CAs, and it's usually best to check the fingerprint.

By using SecItemCopyMatching I can only export the public key into some format not supported by anything else then Apple. With Java I can load public keys as X509 certificate (through java.security.X509EncodedKeySpec) or as module and exponent (through java.security.RSAPublicKeySpec).
Now I need to know how to export a SecKeyRef as X509 certificate or (what I guess is the easier solution) get the module and exponent from it. And I also need the way backwards.

I'm implementing a chat encryption feature in an iOS app, and I'm using symmetric + asymmetric keys to handle it.
Without going too much into details, at backend I use the user's public key to encrypt a symmetric key used to encrypt and decrypt messages.
I created two frameworks, respectively in Swift and in Java (backend) to handle key generation, encryption, decryption, etc. I also have tests for them, so I'm 100% everything works as expected.
However, it looks like the backend is unable to recognize the format of the public key passed from iOS. Using RSA both sides, this is the code I use in Swift to generate the key:

    X509EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(publicBytes);
    KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
    return keyFactory.generatePublic(keySpec);
}

But this fails at the last line, with this exception:
java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException: java.security.InvalidKeyException: IOException: algid parse error, not a sequence

Doing some manual debugging, I noticed that the format of the public key is different - when I generate a key in iOS and then export as base 64, it looks like this:

I'm unable to figure out what's wrong - apparently I wouldn't be surprised if iOS handles keys in a different key, and require special processing in order to talk with other folks.
Any idea?
","Java requires a public key encoded in DER format. Unfortunately iOS does not support this standard format and it is needed an additional conversion (I do not know if this will have improved in the latest versions of swift)
See my answer here You can convert the key using CryptoExportImportManager
func exportPublicKeyToDER(keyId:String) -> NSData?{

    let publicKey = loadKeyStringFromKeyChainAsNSData(PUBLIC_KEY + keyId)
    let keyType = kSecAttrKeyTypeRSA
    let keySize = 2048
    let exportImportManager = CryptoExportImportManager()
    if let exportableDERKey = exportImportManager.exportPublicKeyToDER(publicKey, keyType: keyType as String, keySize: keySize) {
        return exportableDERKey
    } else {
        return nil
    }
}

"53906275","RSA public key created in iOS/Swift and exported as base64 not recognized in Java","TL;DR: RSA public key generated in iOS and stored in the keychain, exported as base64 and sent to a java backend, is not recognized.
I'm implementing a chat encryption feature in an iOS app, and I'm using symmetric + asymmetric keys to handle it.
Without going too much into details, at backend I use the user's public key to encrypt a symmetric key used to encrypt and decrypt messages.
I created two frameworks, respectively in Swift and in Java (backend) to handle key generation, encryption, decryption, etc. I also have tests for them, so I'm 100% everything works as expected.
However, it looks like the backend is unable to recognize the format of the public key passed from iOS. Using RSA both sides, this is the code I use in Swift to generate the key:
// private key parameters
static let privateKeyParams: [String : Any] = [
        kSecAttrIsPermanent as String: true,
        kSecAttrApplicationTag as String: ""..."" // I have a proper unique tag here
]

// public  key parameters
static let publicKeyParams: [String : Any] = [
        kSecAttrIsPermanent as String: true,
        kSecAttrApplicationTag as String: ""..."" // I have a proper unique tag here
]

// global parameters for our key generation
static let keyCreationParameters: [String : Any] = [
        kSecAttrKeyType as String: kSecAttrKeyTypeRSA,
        kSecAttrKeySizeInBits as String: 2048,
        kSecPublicKeyAttrs as String: publicKeyParams,
        kSecPrivateKeyAttrs as String: privateKeyParams
]

...

var publicKey, privateKey: SecKey?
let status = SecKeyGeneratePair(Constants.keyCreationParameters as CFDictionary, &publicKey, &privateKey)

I use specular code to read the keys from the keychain.
This is the piece of code I use to export the public key as a base64 string:
extension SecKey {
  func asBase64() throws -> String {
    var dataPtr: CFTypeRef?
    let query: [String:Any] = [
      kSecClass as String: kSecClassKey,
      kSecAttrApplicationTag as String: ""..."", // Same unique tag here
      kSecAttrKeyType as String: kSecAttrKeyTypeRSA,
      kSecReturnData as String: kCFBooleanTrue
    ]
    let result = SecItemCopyMatching(query as CFDictionary, &dataPtr)

    switch (result, dataPtr) {
    case (errSecSuccess, .some(let data)):
      // convert to Base64 string
      let base64PublicKey = data.base64EncodedString(options: [])
      return base64PublicKey
    default:
      throw CryptoError.keyConversionError
    }
  }
}

public PublicKey publicKeyFrom(String data) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException {
    byte[] publicBytes = Base64.decodeBase64(data);
    X509EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(publicBytes);
    KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");

","We ran into the exact same problem when connecting an iOS app to a Java backend. And the CryptoExportImportManager mentioned by pedrofb helped us out too, which is awesome. However, the code in the CryptoExportImportManager class is a bit elaborated and might be hard to maintain. This is because a top-down approach is used when adding new components to the DER encoding. As a result, numbers contained by length fields must be calculated ahead (i.e. before the contents to which the length applies has been defined). I therefore created a new class that we now use to convert the DER encoding of an RSA public key:
class RSAKeyEncoding: NSObject {

  // ASN.1 identifiers
  private let bitStringIdentifier: UInt8 = 0x03
  private let sequenceIdentifier: UInt8 = 0x30

  // ASN.1 AlgorithmIdentfier for RSA encryption: OID 1 2 840 113549 1 1 1 and NULL
  private let algorithmIdentifierForRSAEncryption: [UInt8] = [0x30, 0x0d, 0x06,
    0x09, 0x2a, 0x86, 0x48, 0x86, 0xf7, 0x0d, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x05, 0x00]

  /// Converts the DER encoding of an RSA public key that is either fetched from the
  /// keychain (e.g. by using `SecItemCopyMatching(_:_:)`) or retrieved in another way
  /// (e.g. by using `SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation(_:_:)`), to a format typically
  /// used by tools and programming languages outside the Apple ecosystem (such as
  /// OpenSSL, Java, PHP and Perl). The DER encoding of an RSA public key created by
  /// iOS is represented with the ASN.1 RSAPublicKey type as defined by PKCS #1.
  /// However, many systems outside the Apple ecosystem expect the DER encoding of a
  /// key to be represented with the ASN.1 SubjectPublicKeyInfo type as defined by
  /// X.509. The two types are related in a way that if the SubjectPublicKeyInfo’s
  /// algorithm field contains the rsaEncryption object identifier as defined by
  /// PKCS #1, the subjectPublicKey field shall contain the DER encoding of an
  /// RSAPublicKey type.
  ///
  /// - Parameter rsaPublicKeyData: A data object containing the DER encoding of an
  ///     RSA public key, which is represented with the ASN.1 RSAPublicKey type.
  /// - Returns: A data object containing the DER encoding of an RSA public key, which
  ///     is represented with the ASN.1 SubjectPublicKeyInfo type.
  func convertToX509EncodedKey(_ rsaPublicKeyData: Data) -> Data {
    var derEncodedKeyBytes = [UInt8](rsaPublicKeyData)

    // Insert ASN.1 BIT STRING bytes at the beginning of the array
    derEncodedKeyBytes.insert(0x00, at: 0)
    derEncodedKeyBytes.insert(contentsOf: lengthField(of: derEncodedKeyBytes), at: 0)
    derEncodedKeyBytes.insert(bitStringIdentifier, at: 0)

    // Insert ASN.1 AlgorithmIdentifier bytes at the beginning of the array
    derEncodedKeyBytes.insert(contentsOf: algorithmIdentifierForRSAEncryption, at: 0)

    // Insert ASN.1 SEQUENCE bytes at the beginning of the array
    derEncodedKeyBytes.insert(contentsOf: lengthField(of: derEncodedKeyBytes), at: 0)
    derEncodedKeyBytes.insert(sequenceIdentifier, at: 0)

    return Data(derEncodedKeyBytes)
  }

  private func lengthField(of valueField: [UInt8]) -> [UInt8] {
    var length = valueField.count

    if length < 128 {
      return [ UInt8(length) ]
    }

    // Number of bytes needed to encode the length
    let lengthBytesCount = Int((log2(Double(length)) / 8) + 1)

    // First byte encodes the number of remaining bytes in this field
    let firstLengthFieldByte = UInt8(128 + lengthBytesCount)

    var lengthField: [UInt8] = []
    for _ in 0..<lengthBytesCount {
      // Take the last 8 bits of length
      let lengthByte = UInt8(length & 0xff)
      // Insert them at the beginning of the array
      lengthField.insert(lengthByte, at: 0)
      // Delete the last 8 bits of length
      length = length >> 8
    }

    // Insert firstLengthFieldByte at the beginning of the array
    lengthField.insert(firstLengthFieldByte, at: 0)

    return lengthField
  }
}

Usage
You could use this class in the function asBase64() like this:
extension SecKey {
  func asBase64() throws -> String {
    var dataPtr: CFTypeRef?
    let query: [String:Any] = [
      kSecClass as String: kSecClassKey,
      kSecAttrApplicationTag as String: ""..."", // Same unique tag here
      kSecAttrKeyType as String: kSecAttrKeyTypeRSA,
      kSecReturnData as String: kCFBooleanTrue
    ]
    let result = SecItemCopyMatching(query as CFDictionary, &dataPtr)

    switch (result, dataPtr) {
    case (errSecSuccess, .some(let data)):

      // convert to X509 encoded key
      let convertedData = RSAKeyEncoding().convertToX509EncodedKey(data)

      // convert to Base64 string
      let base64PublicKey = convertedData.base64EncodedString(options: [])
      return base64PublicKey
    default:
      throw CryptoError.keyConversionError
    }
  }
}

UPDATE - Other Issue
After using the above class for a while, we stumbled upon another issue. Occasionally, the public key that is fetched from the keychain seems to be invalid because, for some reason, it has grown in size. This behavior matches with findings described in the question (although in our case the Base64 encoded key has grown to a size of 392 characters instead of 360 characters). Unfortunately, we didn’t find the exact cause of this strange behavior, but we found two solutions. The first solution is to specify kSecAttrKeySizeInBits along with kSecAttrEffectiveKeySize when defining the query, like in the below code snippet:
let keySize = ... // Key size specified when storing the key, for example: 2048

let query: [String: Any] = [
    kSecAttrKeySizeInBits as String: keySize,
    kSecAttrEffectiveKeySize as String: keySize,
    ... // More attributes
]

var dataPtr: CFTypeRef?

let result = SecItemCopyMatching(query as CFDictionary, &dataPtr)

The second solution is to always delete the old key from the keychain (if any) before adding a new key with the same tag.
UPDATE - Alternative Solution
I published this project on GitHub that can be used as an alternative to the above class.

I guess that it is a #PCKS1 base64 encoded key but I am not sure and I don't know how to generate a similar one in Android - Androids standard is #PCKS8. However I would prefer not to include spongy castle in my project if there is a way around.
","You are in luck; it seems you only have to PEM encode your public key as both Java and OpenSSL use the same SubjectPublicKey structure used for X5.09 certificates. You can get to this by running RSAPublicKey.encode().
Unfortunately I don't know any other library that performs PEM encoding, but I'm sure you can strip out the code from Bouncy or Spongy if required; the Bouncy Castle libraries have a very liberal licensing structure.

I find on web the FGInt package on this site: http://submanifold.be/. I download it(RSA.zip) and I'm in dark - I don't know, how can I put to this code my public key modulus and exponent.
The situation is as follows:
I have signature from device which I need to compare(verify) with calculated message(challenge). I have also an X509 certificate  with embedded public key. I can extract this public key from these certificate. I can also extract modulus and exponent from public key. My problem is, that I don't know, how can I put the obtained modulus and exponent to RSAVerify procedure of FGInt package. The modulus is 128 bytes(I have it as an array of hexa numbers) long and exponent has value of 65537.
Can somebody help with my question, how can be modulus and exponent values inserted into procedure RSAVerify in FGint package?
","If you need RSA functions and you're running on Windows, use the MSCRYPTO API. Info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_CryptoAPI and here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380255(v=vs.85).aspx
If you intend to make your application available outside the US, incorporating custom or third party encryption logic into your application will make your app fall into the ""software munitions"" category of US export restrictions. You will have to apply for an export permit, have your code reviewed by US government reps, etc. or risk hefty fines and possibly criminal charges for export violations. 
If your app instead links to the MSCRYPTO library, you don't have to do any of that. Microsoft takes care of getting export permits for the MSCRYPTO library shipped with Windows.

","Thank you for your answer dthorpe... We don't want to risk any problems with Microsoft license privacy or US export restrictions. We are looking for some free available package for delphi. The FGint package seems to be the right solution for us, but we have problem with inserting modulus and exponent into procedure ""RSAVerify"" (part of FGint.pas). Our questions lie in inserting public key values into this procedure...

"47675696","Extract exactly Public key as ""Decimal"" in PEM format in python","I am trying to reach exact point of in PEM public key's decimal format. Not in Pem.
First of all i get my PEM certificate with using 
from socket import socket

import ssl
from OpenSSL import SSL
import string
import traceback
import json
import re

for i in file_content:
    final_list.append(i.strip())


file = open(""SSL_out_put.json"",""w"")
Temp_Priv_Key_list = [] 

counter = 1
for i in final_list[:4047]:
    print counter
    print i
    counter = counter + 1
    try:
        x = ssl.get_server_certificate((i, 443))
        Temp_Priv_Key_list.append({
            'counter' : counter,

        Temp_Priv_Key_list=[]
    except Exception , err:
        pass
        print Exception , err
file.close()

after that i used ""from pyasn1_modules import pem, rfc2459""
to extract the publick key. This will give binary representation for the public key. after converting decimal i reilze that this is not i want to use. 
Note that in my experiance pyasc1 is not working correctly. 
After lots of research i found this code in here to extract public key BUT still in PEM format.
from cryptography import x509
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend

with open(""cert.pem"", ""rb"") as f:
    cert = f.read()

cert = str(cert)

x509 = OpenSSL.crypto.load_certificate(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, cert)
key_data = (OpenSSL.crypto.dump_publickey(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM,x509.get_pubkey()))
print key_data

Now i have my Publick key as Pem format still. After some other research i found this but only giving this output. Still Can t extract the publick key nither decimal nor binary format.
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from base64 import b64decode
from Crypto.Util import asn1

with open(""public_key.pem"", ""rb"") as f:
   cert = f.read()

#print cert

keyDER = b64decode(cert)
keyPub = RSA.importKey(keyDER)

print keyPub}

this code  will give you the out put of 
<_RSAobj @0x7f65559da320 n(2048),e>
This is my first question. Sorry if i don t asking  proper. My brain is full of all kind of staff with bunch of trash encoding that right now can't understand. Can some one please help me out of this issue.
i found http://lapo.it/asn1js/ that i exactly need it but i can t use it in python. i may use selenium or scrapy to extract the data what i want. But this will really kill me. There should be a way those modules that i tried : 
those modules that i tried on this subject : 
from pyasn1_modules import pem, rfc2459
from pyasn1.codec.der import decoder

Btw for who is encountiring this issue with me . pycrypto is not properly woring on windows (although i install VCPython2.7.msi ""you will know what i mean if you ll try it"")i switch it to virtual-ubuntu. thank you.
","Python ssl lib is not powerfull for this issue. So i change the whole thing to OPENSSL on linux terminal.
timeout 3s openssl s_client -servername (site_name) -connect (site_name):443 -no_alt_chains

this will give you the the PEM what browser will give because of s_client support SNI.
openssl x509 -in outer.pem -text

whit this one you ll get the all peer of your PEM file. if want to you exactly get the Public key modulus that will give you it as hexadecimal.
openssl x509 -in outer.pem -modulus -noout

Alitle bit subprocess you can easly get the output files from terminal outputs and with alittle bit regex you will get the all you want. Ty openssl. I hope i can help somebody who read this.

Other then that, use functions to remove the additional symbols like linebreaks and spaces or.. store the key in a file and use file_get_contents() Secure that file with chmod or store it outside the root directory of your web server.
Alternatively, you can create a file like key.php:
<?php
  return 'yourkey';
?>

And then you can store it in a var like so:
$var = include 'key.php';

This way, code pollution is put back to a minimum.

I execute »cap deploy:setup«. Surprisingly, I have to enter the password of the ssh-user, and from then I have to enter the password again each time I log into the server via ssh on the command line. The public key is not accepted any more, as shown by the output produced by ssh's -v option:

I am using Mac OS Lion locally and Ubuntu on the remote side. My Capistrano is extended by the multistage-extension. I have set
set :ssh_options, {:forward_agent => true}

and it works for the passwordless pulling of the git repository on the remote side.
How can I prevent Capistrano to scrumble up my SSH settings and make it use public key auth again?
Greatly appreciate any help!
EDIT: The problem is Server-side: I just found out that I cannot use other systems to passwordless log into my remote system. How can I know what is wrong with the server?

So I have absolutely no idea why the server keeps asking me for a password. I also have set a password, and this one is working. But I need an auth without a password.
Anyone any idea? I wonder if that really is an incompatibility...
Thanks in advance.
","The entire OpenSSL 0.9.8 release is out of support per openssl.org as is the entire 1.0.0 version!
Also, 0.9.8h in particular is ancient - even your own log shows it's from 2008.  The latest 0.9.8 was 0.9.8zh, per github's OpenSSL release page.
You SHOULD upgrade to the latest 1.0.1 or 1.0.2, or the latest LibreSSL or PolarSSL.
You NEED to at bare minimum upgrade to 0.9.8zh to get 8 years of vulnerability fixes.
You also need to review your sshd_config settings; per the openbsd documentation RSAAuthentication is a Protocol 1 only option, and you've got it set on your Protocol 2 only server.  I just noticed that; you may have other strange configurations in either or both configs - review them both carefully, and compare your post-version-upgrade client ssh_config to working ssh_config files on other clients.

","Not only can you use a public key for encryption, that is actually the normal mode of operation when you are encrypting for secrecy.  This makes sense - anyone can encrypt with the public key, and only the proper recipient can decrypt using their private key.
In many public key systems, signing is mathematically similar to the opposite case - ""encrypting with the private key"" - but note that the signing operation is fundamentally distinct from the encryption operation.  For example, with RSA, signing must use an invariant, verifiable padding method, whereas encryption should use random padding.

","Encryption is about keeping some data confidential; the data is transformed into an opaque blob and the reverse operation requires something that the attacker does not know, i.e. a ""secret"" or ""private"" information. The whole point of encryption is that decryption cannot be done with only public information; hence decryption uses the private key. However, there is no problem in letting anybody encrypt data, thus encryption can use the public key.
There are some algorithms (in practice, only one: RSA) which, from a casual glance, appear to be ""revertible"": you might think about using the private key for encryption, and the public key for decryption. As explained above, there goes confidentiality (if the decryption key is public, then anybody can decrypt, hence the encrypted data cannot be considered as confidential anymore). Such a ""reversed encryption"" may be used as the basis for a digital signature algorithm, in which there is no notion of confidentiality, but, instead, of verifiable proof of key owner action.
However there is more to RSA than the modular exponentiation. RSA encryption first transforms the input message into a big integer through an operation called ""padding"". RSA signature generation first transforms the input message into a big integer through another operation which is also called ""padding""; but this is not at all the same padding. Padding is essential for security, and the needed characteristics are quite distinct between encryption and signature. For instance, an encryption padding needs a high level of added randomness, whereas a signature padding requires a lot of redundancy (and a hash function, in order to accommodate long input messages).
Talking of signatures as ""encryption with the private key"" is the way the RSA standard historically put it (hence names such as ""md5WithRSAEncryption""), but it is inaccurate (paddings are, and must be, different) and overly specific (it applies only to RSA, not El Gamal, DSA, Diffie-Hellman, NTRU...). This is just a widespread confusion.

","Here is the reason why it didn't work. As numerous step-by-step tutorials suggest, one should generate the public key file, copy it to the server and then append the public key to the authorized_keys file with the cat command like this:
cat id_rsa.mypublickey.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Im my case I used PuTTYgen to generate the keys. But the resulting public key file (the one thats saved when you use the save button) was not syntactically applicable for appending to authorized_keys.
To get a correct formatted public key string, copy&paste the generated snippet from the PuTTYgen window to one new line  in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. A correct formatted line looks like this, however, the syntax allows comments and more, too:
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaEAAAAB/*...more letters...*/cPogeHB2XQBQ== rsa-key-20170831

To get the private key in a format that you can use with other ssh-agents  than Putty, you can use PuTTYgen's Conversion option and save the key in OpenSSH format. 
As user ilansch suggested, more comprehensive information is found here: How to convert SSH keypairs generated using PuttyGen(Windows) into key-pairs used by ssh-agent and KeyChain(Linux)

"45961118","Server Authentication via SSH Key fails","I tried to set up private/public key authentication on my server (CentOS). Here are the steps I made:

Generated a public/private keypair with puttygen
Copied the public key to the server and appended it with the cat command to the file /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
Checked suggested file ownership and permissions for .ssh (700) and .ssh/authorized_keys (600)
Restarted the sshd service
In the Putty config under Connection > SSH > Auth, selected the privat key

But when I try to connect with Putty, I get the message ""Server refused our key"". I am prompted for password then, and that works.
I also raised the authentication log level, here is the output for a failed attempt:

"53924326","RSA should I use X.509 or PKCS #1","Use case:
I have a use case wherein client generates private and public key , sends the base 64 encoded public key to the server.
On server side I will encrypt a message using this public key and send the encrypted message to client , which the client decrypts using its private key.The algorithm agreed upon is 'RSA'.
The problem is on server side I am seeing that certain keys are working using X509EncodedKeySpec as key spec
byte[] publicBytes = Base64.decodeBase64(base64EncodedPubKey);
X509EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(publicBytes);
KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
PublicKey pubKey = keyFactory.generatePublic(keySpec);

While some keys throw exception (Caused by: java.security.InvalidKeyException: IOException: algid parse error, not a sequence) using X509EncodedKeySpec but work using RSAPublicKeySpec:
byte[] publicBytes = Base64.decodeBase64(base64EncodedPubKey);
org.bouncycastle.asn1.pkcs.RSAPublicKey.RSAPublicKey pkcs1PublicKey = org.bouncycastle.asn1.pkcs.RSAPublicKey.RSAPublicKey.getInstance(publicBytes);
BigInteger modulus = pkcs1PublicKey.getModulus();
BigInteger publicExponent = pkcs1PublicKey.getPublicExponent();
RSAPublicKeySpec keySpec = new RSAPublicKeySpec(modulus, publicExponent);
KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
PublicKey pubKey = keyFactory.generatePublic(keySpec);

So, what I came to understand is that client and server need to agree whether to use:
PKCS #1 or X.509 for encoding the key . My question is which one is better for my use case? Any guidelines when to use which format?
","There's very little difference. The key format Java calls X.509, more exactly known as the ASN.1 structure SubjectPublicKeyInfo (or SPKI) defined in X.509 or equivalently and more conveniently in RFC5280 sec 4.1, is a quite simple way to handle a large and flexible set of algorithms: it consists of a substructure AlgorithmIdentifier which identifies the algorithm and its parameters if applicable, then an opaque BIT STRING which contains the actual key information (encoded) in a format depending on (the algorithm identified by) the AlgorithmIdentifier. 
For RSA, the algorithm-dependent part is the ASN.1 structure RSAPublicKey defined in PKCS1 or more conveniently RFC8017 appendix A.1.1 and its earlier versions, and duplicated in RFC3279 sec 2.3.1. Thus for RSA the X.509 (SPKI) format contains the PKCS1 format, and since RSA doesn't have parameters (or at least key-related parameters), the only real difference is that the X.509 format explicitly specifies that the key is RSA -- which in your application you already know.
You have already discovered that vanilla (Oracle-was-Sun-now-OpenJDK) Java crypto, aka JCA Java Cryptographic Architecture, directly supports only the X.509 (SPKI) format, which is a minor advantage. However if you use BouncyCastle it is much easier to convert back and forth than the code in your Q; you simply use the org.bouncycastle.asn1.x509.SubjectPublicKeyInfo class to add or discard the AlgorithmIdentifier:
    // test data source
    KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS""); ks.load (new FileInputStream (args[0]), args[1].toCharArray());
    byte[] spkienc = ks.getCertificate(args[2]).getPublicKey().getEncoded();
    System.out.println (DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(spkienc));

    // extract PKCS1 part of original SPKI
    byte[] pkcs1enc = SubjectPublicKeyInfo.getInstance(spkienc).parsePublicKey().getEncoded();
    System.out.println (DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(pkcs1enc));

    // rebuild SPKI from the PKCS1
    AlgorithmIdentifier algid = new AlgorithmIdentifier(PKCSObjectIdentifiers.rsaEncryption, DERNull.INSTANCE);
    byte[] spki2enc = new SubjectPublicKeyInfo (algid, pkcs1enc).getEncoded();
    System.out.println (DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(spki2enc));

See my answer to the similar golang x509.MarshalPKIXPublicKey vs x509.MarshalPKCS1PublicKey() and especially the links to:
Converting A public key in SubjectPublicKeyInfo format to RSAPublicKey format java
Generating RSA keys in PKCS#1 format in Java
Problem transmiting a RSA public key, javaME , bouncy castle 
If you don't have BouncyCastle, it's a little harder; you need to write a partial ASN.1 parser or generator. Full ASN.1 processing is rather complicated, but for this case you need only a small subset that isn't too bad. (Yeah, that's faint praise.) I may add this later if I have more time. 
A much bigger potential issue is that your key is not authenticated. The hard part of public key distribution, much harder than tiny format details, is making sure that only the legitimate key is distributed. If an attacker can substitute their publickey for the correct one, then the victim encrypts the supposedly secret data in a way the attacker can easily read, and all your fancy cryptography code is completely worthless.
This is why most actual systems don't distribute bare publickeys, but instead certificates that allow verifying the key is the correct key. There are a few certificate schemes, but the most widespread by far is X.509 and its Internet profile PKIX -- in fact the RFCs I referenced above, 5280 and 3279, are part of PKIX. SSL-now-TLS uses X.509. Code-signing uses X.509. S/MIME email uses X.509. (PGP/GPG uses a different kind of certificates, not X.509, but still certificates.) And (vanilla) Java directly supports X.509 certificates just as well or even better than it does ""X.509"" (SPKI) publickeys.

how to use RSA public key decrypt cipher in iOS

The public key is used for encryption, not decryption. More correctly, ""decrypting with the public key"" is not a valid cryptographic operation.


In the app,first I generate a random number and post it to server.Server uses its own RSA private key to encrypt the random number and return the encrypt number back to me.I have the server's RSA public key kept in my local as Base64 string.

You realize anyone can probably decrypt the secret. The public key in {n,e}, and most libraries pick a well known e (its probably 3, 17 or 65537).


The problem is how to use the server's RSA public key (all I have is a Base64 string. No PEM or DER type file) to decrypt the cipher back from server. 

It sounds like you are looking for a Probabilistic Signature Scheme with Recovery (PSSR). That way, you can extract the message from the signature after verifying the message is authentic.
If not, you should probably use a well established protocol like IPSec or SSL/TLS to set up a secure channel and tunnel your traffic through it. Its usually a good idea to use something that's well established; and its usually a bad idea to design your own protocols.

","The file extension is simply a conventional way of distinguishing types of files: .pdf for PDF files, .html for HTML files, etc. You can use whatever extension you want (or no extension at all) to store whatever you like. It has no impact on what the file contains. 
So if this file is only relevant to your own application, use whatever name and extension you like. You could use .pdf or .html if you wanted to and it wouldn't change anything (except it would be confusing).

Conservatively I set the expiration date to 1 year.
Setup worked nicely and as the keys approached there expiration date, I proceeded as follows to attempt to extend their expiration date:

Kill running gpg-agent:
pkill gpg-agent

Import offline master key (backup):
gpg --import <KEYID>.master.key

Edit expiry of subkeys (pubkey):
gpg --expert --edit-key <KEYID>


toggle keys 1, 2, 3 (sign, encrypt, authentication) 
expire: 1y
save

Remove secret master keys:
gpg --delete-secret-keys <KEYID>


As a result the keys remain unavailable (expired?) to all means I intent to use them with (kmail/kgpg/kleopatra, evolution/seahorse, etc.).
Where did I go wrong and how may I recover?
","As evident from the comments above, I noted, that the secret keys were (no longer?) listed by gpg --list-secret-keys.
That was remedied by explicitly querying the reader-inserted smart card using gpg --card-status, followed by a now successful gpg --list-secret-keys.
After having pointed evolution at the now available secret key and removing the smart card from its reader, the mail client now (again) asks for insertion of the card when requesting signatures/encryption.

","This is recent change in openssh-6.8, because all we know that md5 is broken and we should start using something more recent.

ssh -o FingerprintHash=md5 server

You can't get SHA256 fingerprint of your server key, because the server has probably old version of openssh and does not support this so far.

","The answer of Jakuje will allow you to compare hashes, but it forces you to keep on using MD5 hashes for verification. MD5 has been shown vulnerable to collision attacks, making it a poor choice for fingerprint verification.
A more secure approach is to generate the SHA256 fingerprint on the server by hand. You can do this by typing:
awk '{print $2}' /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub | base64 -d | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}' | xxd -r -p | base64 | rev | cut -c 2- | rev

Using this approach, you can verify the fingerprint while reaping the full benefits of using SHA256 fingerprints. I wrote a more extensive version of this answer on https://whatsecurity.nl/verifying_ssh_fingerprints_in_new_form.html.

Ive written a self contained example that creates public/private key, create a license by signing user emailaddress with public key, and then check using public key, license and email address that the license indeed was encoded using private key (Obviously this wouldn't all be in one class usually).
This all works but the hex version of the license key is 96 characters (i.e representing 48 bytes/384 bits) which  is a little longer than I wanted (In contrast the length of public/private keys is not a problem and the longer the better). What could I use to generate a 32 (64 hex chars) byte or maybe 16 byte (32 hex chars), and would the security of this be reasonable ?

KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""DSA"");

Signature.getInstance(""SHA/DSA"");

","@Paul - I think your solution here would be to use ECDSA.
Change your line of code 
final KeyPairGenerator keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""DSA"");

to
final KeyPairGenerator keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""ECDSA"");

The keys are much shorter than DSA - and I'm sure hex version signature would be shorter. I suggest you use a prime ECC curve of say 256 or 128 bits.
Please let us know if this solves the problem.

Does anyone know how to solve this error?
","It turned out to be a couple of issues. Here is what I learned along the way:
The tx json data that is used to build the prev_tx object needs to have a output value as a string. Some sites use a number instead.
The key object sometimes doesn't form correctly. For whatever reason, I have an address which can only be generated using the private key with Bitcoin::Key.new. If you supply a private and public key the address associated with the key object is wrong. For different addresses, this isn't the case. So it is important to check the address of the key object after generating the object. 
It is also important to make sure the addresses / keys generated on testnet3 are only used with one another. I had a situation where I thought I generated a testnet3 private key, but didn't. Thus, the testnet3 tx wasn't working. And vice versa for the normal bitcoin network.
Lastly, it's very important to verify the output address position. It is usually 0 or 1, but this isn't always the case...

One issue I am facing is OpenSSH-server generated keys (Pub and private), must be generated after installation through command ssh-keygen...

They are generated after the installation for a reason. And that reason is certainly that they should not go to anyone else (from there is the private word). But they are Host keys.

However, I have to pass explicit and plain-text password, which I would like to avoid.

Why? You can store your public key on them and you would be still able to connect with your private key, which will be still safe.

I would like to know if I can share same private and public keys to everyone, so that I can remote connect on them? In this way, I can generate keys only once and seed it through post-script installation using preseed.

You can, but it is certainly not advised and fail-prone technique possibly leading to the compromised security.

To make the client connect to the server I used a client.key and client.crt that was signed via the same CA .crt file as the server and converted to a .p12 format. The client is supposed to have the private key and public key. But the client shouldn't have the server private key.

","Signing a message does not make it unreadable, so there is no ""recovery"" step required. The signature is a little bit of extra data that may be in the same file or may be stored separately. The signature allows the reader of the message to verify who wrote the message (via the public key that validates the signature) and that the message has not been altered.
If you want to give someone your signed message, you give them the clear-text message and the signature. They can then use your public key to validate the signature. The signature is based on a digest of the message and your private key. The validation step computes the digest of the message and validates the signature of the digest with the public key. If either the public key doesn't correspond to the private key used in the signature, or if the message digest doesn't match, then the signature is detected as invalid.
A related operation would by to encrypt a message. This definitely makes the message unreadable. The encryption would be with a public key and only the holder of the associated private key would be able to decrypt the message.

I have used the following code to convert RSA key from OpenSSL to OpenSSH format. It worked perfectly for RSA key. Now I want to support DSA keys. But my conversion code doesn't work for DSA keys.

","The definition of a dsa key is fundamentally different from that of rsa keys. There ist no 'exponent' (the number you're accessing with $keyInfo['rsa']['e'] and no n.
Because your code parses the key and reencodes it, this won't succeed with dsa keys. Instead, openssl_pkey_get_details gives you a completely different array of elements, as specified in the manual.
To convert this, use the following code:
function sshEncodePublicKey($privKey)
{
    $keyInfo = openssl_pkey_get_details($privKey);

    $buffer  = pack(""N"", 7) . ""ssh-dss"" .
               sshEncodeBuffer($keyInfo['dsa']['p']) .

    return ""ssh-dss "" . base64_encode($buffer);
}

Of course, your code should decide which type of key it is, but I think i can leave this to you.
Please also note that PHP has the function openssl_pkey_get_public, which is more suitable. I used this to test the above code (I simply replaced your first 4 lines with $public_key  = sshEncodePublicKey(openssl_pkey_get_public('file://ssl.pub'));

When I tried the above configuration it failed.  It could not commit the modified POM file to SVN.  To help debug this problem, I set the following environment variable:

When I did this, I saw in the debug statements too many authentication failures with a username other than the [XXXX] username defined in the <server> tag.
So then I tried to specify the username in the command line:

So then I tried to specify the username in the POM:
scm:svn:svn+ssh://[XXXX]@my.server.org/data1/svns_zzzz/zzzz/path/to/the/project/trunk

That didn't work either.
To debug and verify my [XXXX] username and /home/[YYYY]/.ssh/id_rsa key did in fact work, I added them to the environment variable:
SVN_SSH=""ssh -vvv -l [XXXX] -i /home/[YYYY]/.ssh/id_rsa""

After setting the environment variable like this, it worked.  The release plugin was able to successfully commit the modified POM file to SVN.  So I know the username and password work.  
So now the question is what is wrong with my Maven configuration?  Setting the SVN_SSH environment variable helped diagnose the problem, and provides a work-around but I don't want to leave it as a long-term solution.
Any thoughts?
","The release plugin forks the build, and doesn't pass the arguments you provide on the command line to the forked process by default.

I want one clarification on message SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST
As per RFC 4252, client can send this below message to server to just verify the whether publickey would be acceptable or not. 
byte SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST
string user name in ISO-10646 UTF-8 encoding [RFC3629]
string service name in US-ASCII
string ""publickey""
boolean FALSE
string public key algorithm name
string public key blob
Once above message is replied properly by server with SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK. 
Then client sends actual authentication message described below. 
byte SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST
string user name
string service name
string ""publickey""
boolean TRUE
string public key algorithm name
string public key to be used for authentication
string signature :This extra than first message
Now I can see first message (without signature) contains publickey blob. 
Should I verify the blob in first message or I should always skip that and do verification only during actual authentication message ?
I'm asking this because I have implemented my code like it does verification on both messages. But whenever i'm trying test against OpenSSH, it fails on first message for authentication but always get passed with second message. However i have debugged and found out OpenSSH is not sending same publickey blob in both message. so my question is why OpenSSH is doing so ? 
Is OpenSSH is properly following RFC then seems like i should skip verifying publickey blob in first message. if i do that , am i not breaking the RFC ? doing that is right or not ?
Please help me to resolve this query. 
Please let me know if more information is required. 
Thanks in advance.

It is not clear what you mean ""verify"" for the first message,
but, for that message, sshd will just check if the given publickey blob exists in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.  If it exists in that file, ssh client will receive SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK .
> However i have debugged and found out OpenSSH is not sending same publickey

I had implemented a ssh client in Java from scratch, but I had not recognized such OpenSSH behaviors.

"10247796","Best approach to pass the public key from client to server","I have a tcp server and using cms/pkcs#7 to secure the message passed between the client and server. Would it be normal practice to pass the clients public key to the server, as part of initial session? As its the public key, when the session starts up, the initial clp command, would pass the key, along with other salient details that the server needs to know about the client. It's the public, so it doesn't need to be encrypted, it public.
The client/server communication is secured with ssl/tls. 
Thanks.
 Bob.
","Don't you trust SSL/TLS or why do you encrypt again within the secure channel? That only makes sense if the server will pass the message on to other nodes and it will be decrypted somewhere else, thereby creating end-to-end security.
In any case, you should not have the client pass just the public key to the server. Instead it should pass a certificate to the server, which should authenticate the client based on a signature made with the private key matching the public key contained in the certificate. Also, the server will need to check the certificate itself (is it from a trusted CA, do the signatures in the chain verify, etc.).
If you can, you should do all this on the SSL/TLS layer by using SSL/TLS mutual authentication (client cert authentication). If you cannot, then make sure you design a secure application layer protocol for authenticating the client and it's public key. Otherwise it may be possible to impersonate other clients.

","One bug is how you created the RSAPublicKeySpec:

In case the first bit of the modulusBytes or exponentBytes is one the number will be interpreted as negative value.
When you work with RSA numbers and BigInteger always use the constructor BigInteger (int signum, byte[] magnitude) with signum=1 for specifying that the number is positive:
new RSAPublicKeySpec(new BigInteger(1, modulusBytes), new BigInteger(1, exponentBytes));

"11239501","Which decryption uses a binary public key with variable length?","I have a program which is obviously decrypting its data with a public, binary key of variable length.
I came to these facts by doing some more or less educated guesses:

Reverse Engineering revealed that the program needs the name of a file including a public key
Viewing this file in a hex editor shows totally random binary data (with no interesting pattern or anything), prefixed with the length of the file - in one version the file is only 200 bytes long, in another about 2000 bytes.
Thinking about the security, I guess the programs company encrypts the data files with a private key so that noone can create their own data files (which would fit the programs needs - no ""modding"" should be allowed nor the data be shown in third party programs).
The data files are prefixed with a human readable 64 byte long header, the rest is again completely random binary data.

I'd like to use the same system for my own program, if such thing is available.
Is there an encryption method capable of asymmetric encryption / decryption with a binary key of variable length, if yes, which one and how can I implement such thing?
","That's not the way to proceed. You can use a fixed length key for variable length data. As asymmetric crypto is pretty slow, the usual method is to generate a random symmetric secret key (say, a 128 bit AES key) and encrypt the data using e.g. CBC. Then the symmetric key is encrypted by an asymmetric public key, say RSA 2048 bits. Decryption means decrypting the secret key using the private key, then decrypting the data with the data specific secret key.
If you don't know how to do this you can use a library capable of creating CMS (cryptographic message syntax) to perform this scheme.
Note: a 2000 byte asymmetric key pair would take forever to encrypt something, even if you could create a key pair of that size.

Load your key to PuTTYgen;
To the Key comment box, enter you GCE username – this should be your Google account with symbols replaced by an underscore (_) everything after @ ignored. Or specify any other account name you want to be created.
And see the box Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file.

For details, see (my) guide Connecting Securely to Google Compute Engine Server with SFTP with WinSCP.
Example (not your key):

I.e. the format you need to paste to the authorized_keys file is very different to the format, you see when you open the key file in a text editor.
Also the format you have included in your message is not the PuTTY key format, it's the ssh.com format. Which is completely irrelevant to your setup (PuTTY client and OpenSSH server).

","Sounds like you want x.509 authentication. Help on getting that setup is a little too broad for a single stack overflow question. There are various guides you can find with a Google search and for the nitty gritty details of what is happening under the hood and common issues I wrote a long blog post.
If you really don't want the encryption of the ""whole connection"" (and I would strongly encourage you to reconsider that since it is basically free) you can use on the NULL cipher suites with the SSL connection. Configuring the client to offer only NULL cipher suites (and getting the server to accept them) will, again, require more details on your specific setup.
HTH - Rob
P.S. Just to be clear the authentication messages in SSL are done ""in the clear"". The contents of the messages contain portions that are asymmetrically encrypted (challenges and pre-master secret) but the bulk of the handshake exchanges are in the clear.

check that V is indeed formatted per SHA256withRSA (also known as RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 with SHA-256 hash),
on the right of V after a fixed DER prefix 3031300d060960864801650304020105000420 characteristic of a Digestinfo with SHA-256 we extract the 32-byte value f4efef8c788058df45385ec65a49e92f806b9ffd6fc6d11b4f3c2cf89a81fe2f, which thus is the expected hash for that example's signed data.

So with a little trial and error we find what that signed data really is. We want to start from XML file and remove

the s tag
its = (and, should there be any, whitespace between former s tag and =, and after = as allowed by the XML syntax)
its value field including leading and closing "" (which contains the base64-encoded signature)
precisely two nearby space characters, like the one before the s tag and the one after the closing "" (alternatively, we might want to leave a single space where there are now several, probably three after the removals in bullet points 1-3).

then hash what remains including < /> delimiters (as UTF-8), that is in the sample code pass it to BlockUpdate or verify_update. For that example:

Read the entire XML and separate the s=”xxxx” tag from it.
Use a signature validation algorithm leveraging “SHA256withRSA” based hashing and encryption technique
Signature value present in “s” tag, remaining XML (without ""s"" tag) and UIDAI public key (available here.) is to be fed to the algorithm to validate the digital signature.

The point is using:

because former one returns a 64 byte publicKey whilst latter one returns a 65 byte publicKey preceded by a ""04"" byte.

","To understand this question, its best to know a little about asymmetric encryption. In asymmetric encryption, you have a public key and a private key. Together they make a ""keypair."" The public key is used to encrypt. The private key is then used to decrypt. Note the private key can only decrypt files that were encrypted with the matching public key.
So now we know that there are 2 files needed to make everything work.

Can I just copy my private key from this computer among my other computers to connect to >the servers, or do I have to generate private keys on each computer and then authorize >their public keys on each server?

The answer simply is, yes. You can copy the public or private key to any computer and use it with any OS. As long as you have the public key, you can encrypt messages. If you have the private key, then you can decrypt those files afterwards. Its just a matter of the files being present on the computer.

If not, is there a better way to do it (that would save me some time)?

While theres no technical reason you cant copy and reuse the same keypair everytime, this is not a good practice in terms of security. For example, if you have a forest of 100 servers all sharing the same keypair, if 1 is compromised or hacked, the rest of the 99 servers are also compromised. If you have a unique keypair on each server, then they would need to compromise all 100 servers to get the same effect. The simple act of using a unique keypair everytime increases the amount of work for an attacker by orders of magnitude.

","You can't create a new key pair to access an existing instance. The keypair selected is only installed on the instance when its launched, any additional keys have to be added to the instance directly.
If you need to add a new key to an existing instance, you can do the following:

Stop your instance.
Detach the root volume.
Attach to a new instance as a secondary volume and mount the volume.
Update the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file for the user you are trying to login with. You would put your new public key in this file.
Unmount the volume, and reattach it to the original instance.

If you did everything right, you will be able to access the instance after you restart. Unless your in VPC your ip will change when you stop the instance.

","I agree with datasage's answer. Another way to get access is to create an AMI image of the current instance and then launch a new instance from that image. When you launch the new instance, you will have the option to create a new key pair or to use an existing one.
Once you can connect to the new instance, you can reassign the Elastic IP (if any) of the old instance to the new one and just terminate the old instance.

"46141265","How does the verification server recognize which public key to use in RSA?","
I am trying to implement a (simplified) RSA-like verification process in my (Java) application. 
The client sends a request (data + private key signature) and the server either rejects his request or processes it - depending on the signature validity. 
But I don't understand how the verification server knows which public key to use for signature decryption. Indeed, no public key - nor public key ID - seem to be sent to the verification server. 
Does it actually test all authorized public keys ? Or is the public key stored from a previous communication exchange ?
","As the figure you attach with the question suggests, the client sends its certificate along with the signature, the certificate contains the public key, the server check for certificate validity and use it to check the signature.

","The figure has several errors and some omissions, because it is probably a simplification:

the hash is digitally signed, not encrypted, and the signature is verified, not decrypted. The underlying cryptographic operation is not equivalent.
the signed data should include the certificate and the certification chain
if you use a known format like CMS, pkcs#7 or XMLDsig the hash to sign usually includes also a  reference to the signing certificate and content-type to avoid tampering

To validate a signed document you verify the signature using the public key of the attached certificate but it is mandatory to check that the signing certificate is trusted verifying that the certificate itself or the issuing Certification Authority is present in the client's trustore. 
The signature includes the certification chain because usually the truststore does not contain the intermediate CAs. The certificates of the truststore are exchanged previously
Additionaly the verification process should check that the certificate is not expired and not revoked

Note that the verification process is the same for all digital certificates in a public key infrastructure, not just RSA

"2149243","Certificate Authority vs Stored public key","I'm developing a J2ME app which securely connects to a server to login. I'm having a lot of difficulty in setting up the SSL between the two so I thought of a simpler solution and I'm hoping you can give your views on it.
The J2ME Midlet is shipped WITH the server's public key, on connect a message (username, password hash and random) is encrypted using that public key and sent to the server. The server then decrypts it and uses it to authenticate the client.
The main idea of the certificate authority is to say who is who, if the two parties know that already and agree that it won't change (unless through an already authenticated connection), then don't I bypass the need for one?
Thanks,
Vladimir
","
if the two parties know that already and agree that it won't change ... then don't I bypass the need for one?

Yes, but I think you are missing the point.  The program is shipped with the key, but there is no way of the user knowing that the program they're downloading actually came from you, and not some malicious hacker intercepting/rewriting the communication; all the user sees is bits coming in from a wire on the wall.
Typically what you'll do then is sign the jar with your key, and ship the key with your program.  Now we have a chicken-and-egg problem:  how do they know that the key came from you?
This is where the certificate authority comes in; the CA's key is already on their computer, so they leave it up to the CA to verify who you are and sign your public key.  Then when the user gets the public key, verifies that it was signed by the CA, and verifies that the jar was signed by the key, they know the key is yours and thus the jar must have come from you, since you are the only one who could have signed it with the private key.
Now, if your key were on their computer ahead of time (for instance, inside of a company where the keys are physically placed on the computers when they're being set up), they yes, you absolutely don't need to have the key signed.

-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----

I don't know how this key has been generated, I'm sorry. I have been told to take this key and verify the signature of another string that I'll call ""object"". I have been told that the algorithm that I have to use to verify ""object"" is SHA256withRSA.
So, I have written the following java method to read the key
private PublicKey getPublicKey(String publicKey) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException, UnsupportedEncodingException {
    publicKey = publicKey.replaceAll(""\\n"", """");
    publicKey = publicKey.replace(""-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----"", """");
    publicKey = publicKey.replace(""-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----"", """");
    publicKey = publicKey.trim();
    byte[] keyDecoded = Base64.getDecoder().decode(publicKey.getBytes());
    X509EncodedKeySpec publicSpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(keyDecoded);
    KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
    PublicKey pubKey = kf.generatePublic(publicSpec);
    return pubKey;
}

The point is that I get the following exception:

java.security.InvalidKeyException: IOException: algid parse error, not
  a sequence

I have read plenty of qustions as mine in stackoverflow. The code written by other users is pretty similar (sometimes identical) to mine. So I definitely don't get why it doesn't work for me. Other developers (workmates) are doing the same in php and it works great, so I would discard the hypothesis of wrong public key. Maybe didn't I understood the process clearly? Do you have any clue, please?
I have also tried to cope with the problem using BouncyCastle library, as suggested here, but I get the same exception. The following is the code I have written:
private static PublicKey getPublicKey(String publicKey)
        throws IOException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException {
    Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());
    PemReader pp = new PemReader(new StringReader(publicKey));
    PemObject pem = pp.readPemObject();
    byte[] content = pem.getContent();
    pp.close();

    X509EncodedKeySpec spec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(content);
    KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
    return kf.generatePublic(spec);
}

","You can't load that key using an X509EncodedKeySpec. According to it's JavaDoc documentation it expects the following format:
SubjectPublicKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
   algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
   subjectPublicKey BIT STRING }

Instead your key looks different. I used the data from your post, converted it to hex data and posted it into the online ASN.1 decoder.

As you may recognize your key does not contain an AlgorithmIdentifier therefore it can not be loaded using X509EncodedKeySpec. 
My suggestion would be to use the BouncyCastle library and it's PEMParser class for loading this key:
File pemFile = new File(""test.pem"");
try (PEMParser pp = new PEMParser(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(pemFile)))) {
    SubjectPublicKeyInfo subjPubKeyInfo = (SubjectPublicKeyInfo) pp.readObject();
    RSAKeyParameters rsa = (RSAKeyParameters) PublicKeyFactory.createKey(subjPubKeyInfo);

    RSAPublicKeySpec rsaSpec = new RSAPublicKeySpec(rsa.getModulus(), rsa.getExponent());
    KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
    java.security.PublicKey publicKey = kf.generatePublic(rsaSpec);
    System.out.println(publicKey);
}

Or you manually convert the key to PKCS#8 format via openssl.

"41758188","Is RSACryptoServiceProvider working correctly?","I'm using .NET's implementation of RSA, and two things looked odd to me.  I'd like to confirm that it's operating properly.
Background
Using System.Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider with 2048-bit keyword size to perform asymmetric encryption/decrpytion, initially following the example in this question, ""AES 256 Encryption: public and private key how can I generate and use it .net"".
As a first implementation, this seems to work:
public const int  CSPPARAMETERS_FLAG = 1;      // Specifies RSA: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms148034(v=vs.110).aspx
public const bool USE_OAEP_PADDING   = false;
public const int  KEYWORD_SIZE       = 2048;

public static byte[] Encrypt(byte[] publicKey, byte[] dataToEncrypt)
{
    var cspParameters = new System.Security.Cryptography.CspParameters(CSPPARAMETERS_FLAG);
    byte[] encryptedData = null;

    using (var rsaProvider = new System.Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider(cspParameters))
    {
        try
        {
            rsaProvider.PersistKeyInCsp = false;
            rsaProvider.ImportCspBlob(publicKey);
            encryptedData = rsaProvider.Encrypt(dataToEncrypt, USE_OAEP_PADDING);
        }
        finally
        {
            rsaProvider.PersistKeyInCsp = false;
            rsaProvider.Clear();
        }
    }
    return encryptedData;
}

public static byte[] Decrypt(byte[] privateKey, byte[] dataToDecrypt)
{
    var cspParameters = new System.Security.Cryptography.CspParameters(CSPPARAMETERS_FLAG);
    byte[] encryptedData = null;

    using (var rsaProvider = new System.Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider(cspParameters))
    {
        try
        {
            rsaProvider.PersistKeyInCsp = false;
            rsaProvider.ImportCspBlob(privateKey);
            encryptedData = rsaProvider.Decrypt(dataToDecrypt, USE_OAEP_PADDING);
        }
        finally
        {
            rsaProvider.PersistKeyInCsp = false;
            rsaProvider.Clear();
        }
    }

    return encryptedData;
}

After looking into these methods a bit more, it seems that the public key that I've been generating as from the example seemed to have a lot of very predictable data at its start, and it was 276-bytes long.
Apparently rsaProvider.ExportCspBlob(bool includePrivateParameters) is a functional alternative to rsaProvider.ExportParameters(bool includePrivateParameters); the main difference is that the blob is already serialized as a byte[] while the other emits the object version, RSAParameters.
Two observations about the methods:

The .Exponent is always 0x010001$=65537$.
The exported blobs contain 17 extra bytes versus the serialized typed versions.


rsaProvider.ExportCspBlob():


Public key is 276 bytes.
Private key is 1172 bytes.

RSAParameters:


Public key is 259 bytes.


.Exponent.Length =   3
.Modulus .Length = 256

Private key is 1155 bytes.


.D       .Length = 256
.DP      .Length = 128
.DQ      .Length = 128
.Exponent.Length =   3
.InverseQ.Length = 128
.Modulus .Length = 256
.P       .Length = 128
.Q       .Length = 128


The extra 17 bytes appear to be at the header of the binary blob.


Concerns
From this, two concerns:

Is it okay for the exponent to not be random?


If the exponent is defined as a constant, then it'd seem like that's another 3 bytes I could shave off the serialization?
Another question, Should RSA public exponent be only in {3, 5, 17, 257 or 65537} due to security considerations?, seems to suggest that $\left{3, 5, 17, 257, 65537\right}$ are all common values for the exponent, so 0x101$=65537$ seems reasonable if it's true that there's no harm in always using the same constant exponent.

Are the 17 extra bytes an information leak?


Do they represent the option parameters like key length and method?
Is it a good idea to be transmitting option parameter information when I already know that both the sender and receiver are using the same, hard-coded method?


Question
Is RSACryptoServiceProvider's behavior a cause for concern, or are these things normal?
Update 1
In Should RSA public exponent be only in {3, 5, 17, 257 or 65537} due to security considerations?, the accepted answer starts off by noting:

There is no known weakness for any short or long public exponent for RSA, as long as the public exponent is ""correct"" (i.e. relatively prime to p-1 for all primes p which divide the modulus).

If this is so, then I'd guess that the apparently-constant exponent of 0x010001$=65537$ is sufficient as long as it's relatively prime to $p-1$.  So, presumably the .NET implementation of RSA checks for this condition.
But then what does RSACryptoServiceProvider do if that condition isn't satisfied?  If it selects a different exponent, then that'd seem to leak information about $p$ whenever the exponent isn't 0x010001.  Or, if a different key is selected, then it'd seem like we can just assume that the exponent is always 0x010001 and omit it from the serialization.
","Everything reported is normal, and non-alarming.
It is perfectly OK for the public exponent e to be short and non-random. e = 216+1 = 65537 = 0x010001 is common and safe. Some authorities mandate it (or some range including it). Using it (or/and something significantly larger than the bit size of the public modulus) gives some protection against some of the worst RSA paddings.
No, the 17 extra bytes in the public key are unlikely to be an information leak; they more likely are a header part of the data format chosen for an RSA public key by the software you use. My guess is that you are encountering the MS-specific format detailed in this answer (perhaps, within endianness), which also uses precisely 276 bytes for an RSA public key with a 2048-bit public modulus. In that case, you should find that the extra bytes are always the same (thus they demonstrably leak nothing). And there are countless more subtle ways to leak information about the private key, like in the public modulus itself.
Many RSA key generators used in practice, including I guess RSACryptoServiceProvider, first choose e, then somewhat avoid generating primes p such that gcd(e, p-1) ≠ 1. Since e = 65537 is prime, it is enough that ( p % e ) ≠ 1, and this is easily checked, or otherwise insured by the process generating p.

","According to your comments you convert the bytes of the encoded public key directly to String using the default encoding, which will for sure drop/replace some of the bytes. See the JavaDoc for new String(bytes[]).
So the content of pair.getPublic().getEncoded() and keystring.getBytes() won't be the same.
Use a suitable transport encoding, like Base64. On Java 8, you can use java.util.Base64 for that, on older platforms the Apache Commons Codec's Base64 class can be used.

You can also go the other route and have the key generated on the remote system and try importing the private key into your Putty key chain. That might work too and will guarantee its compatible with the remote system.

If the signature is wrapping, then surely you can get original data back. Signed data doesn't require a private key to be verified and extracted.

I want to test it by comparing it to the output of the Cipher class in Java using RSA-OAEP and SHA-256. According to PKCS #1, RSA-OAEP requires a label, which by default is an empty string. However, I can't find a way to input a label in the built-in class. My implementation seems to work correctly for both encryption and decryption, but Cipher class produces different output. Is there a default label which the Cipher class uses?
","What is called label L in PKCS1v2.1 RSAES-OAEP was called encoding parameters P in v2.0; see the description of pSourceAlgorithm in A.2.1. The Java API keeps the old terminology, presumably for compatibility, and the default is indeed an empty octet string, implemented in Java as a byte array of length 0. See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/crypto/spec/PSource.PSpecified.html . Note that even when P-call-me-L is empty, its hash which goes in DB before masking is not empty.
When you say 'different output', you do realize that OAEP is randomized (in a way that provably does not leak information to the adversary) and every encryption of the same plaintext should produce a unique ciphertext, but all of them should decrypt back to the same plaintext, right?

","You haven't given enough information, such as the actual signature or how it is encoded. Normally RSA means RSA in PKCS#1 1.5 mode using SHA-1 (Google it) which is more or less the default signature generation/verification algorithm in use today. In that case, the verify should proceed as you've described. The password is not needed anymore, it might just be used to decrypt the private key. You can still use the private key to see if an sign in PHP/openssl does create the same data. If not, a different hash or PKCS#1 v2.1 signature may have been used.

vf.Put(digest, CryptoPP::SHA256::DIGESTSIZE);

The signature is not the hash size. The signature is the size of the modulus (or more correctly, [0,n-1]). After protocol framing, the signature may be larger than the modulus size. Also see What is the length of an RSA signature? on the Cryptography Stack Exchange.
As for creating an equivalent iOS example, using the ""Raw Sign"" or ""Raw Encrypt"", see Raw RSA on the Crypto++ wiki. Its usually a bad idea for you to do the low level things like a modular exponentiation. You should try to stay in the protocols and cryptosystems, like RSASSA_PKCS1v15_SHA_Signer and RSASSA_PKCS1v15_SHA_Verifier.
Also checkout the RSASS class, which is RSA Signature Scheme. I'm guessing you will probably want a RSASS<PKCS1v15, SHA256>::Signer and RSASS<PKCS1v15, SHA256>::Verifier:
$ grep -IR Signer * | grep typedef
luc.h:typedef LUCSS<PKCS1v15, SHA>::Signer LUCSSA_PKCS1v15_SHA_Signer;
pubkey.h:   typedef PK_FinalTemplate<TF_SignerImpl<SchemeOptions> > Signer;
pubkey.h:   typedef PK_FinalTemplate<DL_SignerImpl<SchemeOptions> > Signer;
rsa.h:typedef RSASS<PKCS1v15, SHA>::Signer RSASSA_PKCS1v15_SHA_Signer;

","That's not a text, it's a binary data. As you are using python2 it doesn't fully distinguish bytes from str so you should care about this.
The other side should get this bytes exactly as rsa outputs them so you can just write them into your connection or file (presuming you are talking binary to them).

","For web you can base64 encode the data. It's a common and good way to encode binary data.

'ZGF0YQ=='

By the way you are not suppose to use RSA that way. It's highly insecure to use raw RSA. You must use a probabilistic encryption scheme with proper padding, e.g. RSAES-OAEP. PKCS#1 defines such scheme for encryption and signatures.

In your gitolite-admin/keydir directory of the gitolite-admin.git repo check that your public key file is there.  Also that it matches the private key of the file your are using to connect.

","Answering my own question in case anyone else needs this.
I also wrote an article about this, hope someone finds it useful.
https://tmarkovski.github.io/eth-azure/keyvault-part1/
Initially, I was generating the incorrect key type. I was able to generate the key by concatenating the X and Y arrays from JWK. Here's my sample code I was playing with in F#. It uses BouncyCastle for the Keccak hash function.
Important thing to note is the use of ""EC-HSM"" key type. This is part of the Premium SKU for Key Vault and only this type supports SECP256K1 curve, otherwise throws an exception if using ""EC"" key type.

In the docs of AWS API Gateway (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started-client-side-ssl-authentication.html), they suggest to use client-certificate-auth (https://www.npmjs.com/package/client-certificate-auth), but I can't find a way to use it on my Sails backend. 
I've tried using serverOptions in Sails, but it crashes with:
error: TypeError: ""listener"" argument must be a function

So I'm pretty much lost on this one. If anyone has experience with it, please advice :)
Thanks
","Step 0:
As mentioned in some of the comments - you'll need to change the ELB to be a classic ELB and load balance TCP on port 443 instead of HTTPS. 
Step 1: you'll need to launch sails with HTTPS - the config looks something like this:
      http: {
        serverOptions: {
          requestCert: true,
          rejectUnauthorized: true
        }
      },
      ssl: {
        key: key.Body.toString(),
        cert: cert.Body.toString()
      }

So either config/http.js and config/ssl.js, or pass those to sails.lift().
Step 2: run the middleware. - there are lots of different ways to do this, but since you say you only want to do it some routes, I'd create a policy that runs client-certificate-auth, or even possibly better, just call req.connection.getPeerCertificate() and check the things you want to check. No need to use an extra npm module when you don't have to.

If yes, how to achieve that in phpseclib ( http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/ ) library? Theirs examples (http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/new/rsa/examples.html) aren't very clear.

Sadly, this is what I have been able to do so far

...etc.
If you're working with them as distinct ""objects"" then it makes me wonder if you're trying to do textbook RSA, which shouldn't really be used outside of the classroom.
In any event,
<?php
include('Crypt/RSA.php');
include('Math/BigInteger.php');

$rsa = new Crypt_RSA();
$rsa->loadKey(array(
    'e' => new Math_BigInteger('...'),
    'n' => new Math_BigInteger('...')
));

Math_BigInteger itself can optionally take two parameters. The second tells it the format, be it base-10, base-256, base-16, base-2, etc. If you have a base64 encoded number you'll need to pass it through base64_decode and (probably) tell Math_BigInteger that it's a base-256 number. By default Math_BigInteger assumes numbers are base-10.
To do textbook RSA after that (ie. no randomized padding - this method should not be used in real world applications) do the following:
$rsa->setEncryptionMode(CRYPT_RSA_ENCRYPTION_NONE);
$rsa->encrypt('...');

Attacker will be able to (via code modification) also intercept user sensitive data entered by users via web during potential attack.

Attacker will be able to (via code modification) also intercept user sensitive data entered by users via web during potential attack. Later I consider as a higher risk, but provided that it is hard (is it?) for attacker to modify code without someone noticing I guess I shouldn't worry much about it.
If App Server 2 and private key are compromised then attacker will have access to everything, but App Server 2 or DB Server 2 are not web facing so it shouldn't be a problem.

Thank you!
","I don't think I can give a proper response because I'm not sure the goal of your system is clear. While I appreciate you getting feedback on a design, it's a bit hard without a purpose.
I would suggest to you this though:
Strongly document and analyse your threat model first
You need to come up with a fixed hard-lined list of all possible attack scenarios. Local attackers, etc, who are you trying to protect against? You also say things like 'with proper key management'; yet this is one of the hardest things to do. So don't just assume you can get this right; fully plan out how you will do this, with specific linking to who it will prevent attacks by.
The reason you need to do a threat model, is that you will need to determine on what angles you will be vulnerable; because this will be the case.
I will also suggest that while the theory is good; in crypto implementation is also very critical. Do not just assume that you will do things correctly, you really need to take care as to where random numbers come from, and other such things.
I know this is a bit vague, but I do think that at least coming up with formal and strong threat model, will be very helpful for you.

"1452527","How secure is this architecture?","I'm building a system that need to collect some user sensitive data via secured web connection, store it securely on the server for later automated decryption and reuse. System should also allow user to view some part of the secured data (e.g., *****ze) and/or change it completely via web. System should provide reasonable level of security.
I was thinking of the following infrastructure:
App (Web) Server 1

Web server with proper TLS support
for secured web connections.
Use public-key algorithm (e.g. RSA) to
encrypt entered user sensitive data
and send it to App Server 2 via
one-way outbound secured channel
(e.g. ssh-2) without storing it
anywhere on either App Server 1 or DB
Server 1.
Use user-password-dependent
symmetric-key algorithm to encrypt
some part of the entered data (e.g.
last few letters/digits) and store
it on the DB Server 1 for later
retrieval by App Server 1 during
user web session.
Re-use step 2 for data modification by user via web.

DB Server 1

Store unsecured non-sensitive user
data.
Store some part of the sensitive
user data encrypted on App Server 1
(see step 3 above)

App Server 2

Do NOT EVER send anything
TO App Server 1 or DB Server 1.
Receive encrypted user sensitive
data from App Server 1 and store it
in DB Server 2.
Retrieve encrypted
user sensitive data from DB Server 2
according to the local schedules,
decrypt it using private key
(see App Server 1, step 2) stored
locally on App Server 2 with proper key management.

DB Server 2

Store encrypted user sensitive data (see App Server 2, step 2)

If either App (Web) Server 1 or DB Server 1 or both are compromised then attacker will not be able to get any user sensitive data (either encrypted or not). All attacker will have is access to public-key and encryption algorithms which are well known anyway.

Thank you!
","I would not recommend using any form of public key to communicate from your web server to your app server.  If you control both system just a regular secret system of encryption.  You know the identity of your app server, so keeping the key secure is not an issue.  If you ever need to change or update the secret key just do so manually to prevent it from leaking across a connection.
What I would be most careful about is direction of data transfer from your server in your DMZ, which should only be your webserver, to those boxes residing internally to your network.  It is becoming increasingly common for legitimate domains to be compromised to distribute malware to visiting users.  That is bad, but if the malware were to turn in ward to your network instead of only outward to your users then your business would be completely hosed.
I also did not see anything about preventing sql injection or system hardening/patching to prevent malware distribution.  This should be your first and most important consideration.  If security were important to you then you would be your architecture to be flexible to minor customizations of inter-server communication and frequent patching.  Most websites, even major legitimate businesses, never fix their security holes even if they are compromised.  You must be continually fixing security holes and changing things to prevent holes from arise if you wish to avoid being compromised in the first place.
To prevent becoming a malware distributor I would suggest making hard and fast rules upon how media is served that contains any sort of client-side scripting.  Client-side scripting can be found in JavaScript, ActiveX, Flash, Acrobat, Silverlight, and other code or plugin that executes on the client system.  Policies for serving that content must exist so that anomolous code fragments can be immediately identified.  My recommendation is to NEVER embed client-side code directly into a browser, but always reference some external file.  I would also suggest conslidating like minded media to give you better asset control and save you bandwidth, such as serving one large JavaScript file instead of 8 small ones.  I would also recommend forcing all such media onto an external content distribution system that references your domain in its directory structure.  That way media is not served from your servers directly and if it served from you directly you can quickly identify it as potentially malicious and necessittating a security review.

Check that the security group for the ec2 server allows port 22 to the IP address that the PHP is running on.
Check that you are using the correct Server IP, username. Generally speaking most of the EC2 server AMI are built with remote root login disabled, you will need to use the right username like on Amazon AMI you need to use ec2-user and on ubuntu amiit is ubuntu

While chatting 2 users say A and B. After both users logged in and have some communication between them. Now both users reload/logged out or logged in then old messages was sent was not able to decrypt as new private keys will be generated.
I so not want to stored the public and private key of users in database or in local storage.
","David from Virgil here. Thanks for the question and sorry for making you puzzled.
I believe the issue is: while the sample app generated user private & public keys both for Alice and Bob, published the public keys to our Cards service, it hasn’t saved the private keys anywhere. So, the private keys remained in the browser's local storage and as such, didn’t sync to other browsers/devices where your users have logged in next. So in lack of their private keys, your users weren’t able to decrypt their messages... This is a limitation of the sample app and we should fix that ASAP (task created).
In order to get the app working, I.e. make your users be able to log in from another browser and decrypt messages, they need to retrieve their respected private keys from a central location. Now, it'd be too lame for me to recommend to just save the user private keys to your database (and enable others to access it + decrypt your users' messages), so we created a technology called BrainKey to encrypt the user private key with a key that we derive from the user’s password. Similar approach how Apple uses your TouchID-derived key to encrypt your keychain.
This is what you need to do to make it work:

During user signup (on the client device), generate a private key for your user and publish the public key to our Cards service.
Then use the user's password to generate a BrainKey (which technically is a private key).
Generate the public key from the BrainKey and encrypt the user's previously (Step 1) generated private key.
Now, save this encrypted private key to your database for the user.

Every single time your user logs in with her password, re-generate the same BrainKey from her password, download the encrypted private key from your DB, decrypt it with the BrainKey and now you can use this key to decrypt all chat messages that were sent to her.
Here’s a reference and sample code for our BrainKey tech: https://developer.virgilsecurity.com/docs/javascript/use-cases/v1/brainkey
Does it make sense? Would you like to see a sample code that does it? If you join our Slack, we can chat real-time, I’m @dave: https://join.slack.com/t/virgilsecurity/shared_invite/enQtMjg4MDE4ODM3ODA4LTc2OWQwOTQ3YjNhNTQ0ZjJiZDc2NjkzYjYxNTI0YzhmNTY2ZDliMGJjYWQ5YmZiOGU5ZWEzNmJiMWZhYWVmYTM

I so not want to stored the public and private key of users in database or in local storage.
","I'm Dim from Virgil. Let me help you with this use-case.
I prepared some additional information:
Steps #1 and #2 from Virgil Simple JS Demo (You’ve already seen it)
Step #1. User Registration Step.
users register their Public Keys
At this step:

You authenticate Alice
After you successfully authenticated Alice, you give her a JWT to grant her access to Virgil’s Cloud APIs
Alice generates her Private Key (2) -> stores her Private Key into Local Storage -> creates her Virgil Card
Alice Publishes (3) her Virgil Card on Virgil Cards Service (She uses her JWT to do it).
Then you authenticate Bob (User B): same story as Alice.

At the end, Alice and Bob have their own Private Keys and Virgil Cards (Public Key published into our cloud for users to find each other’s Public Keys). 
Step #2. Simple Communication (chat).
Simple e2e encrypted communication
At this step:

Alice looks for & finds Bob’s Public Key at Virgil Cards Service (1)
Alice loads her Private Key from her Local Storage in a browser
Alice signs (with her Private Key) and encrypts (with Bob’s Public Key) a message and sends to Bob through your Application Server
Bob receives the encrypted and signed message
Bob goes to Cards Service to find Alice’s Public Key in order to verify her signature
Bob loads his Private Key from his Local Storage and decrypts the message

As a result, Bob verified Alice’s signature and decrypted the Message from Alice.
And now, comes the problem: Alice decided to use another Browser (or a Device B), but she can’t encrypt Bob’s previous messages on the new device.
Solution: you should transmit her Previous Private Key from Device A to Device B. To do this in the most secure way:

is to encrypt Private Key on a device A with some Additional Secret Key.
transmit encrypted Private Key to Device B. 
use the same Additional Secret Key on Device B to decrypt the encrypted Private Key from Device A.

So, as you see you must use some special Additional Secret Key on both devices (some messengers do this with a QR code between the devices) to do it securely. To do it simpler though, we have a special tech for you to you generate the “Additional Secret Key” that will be the same on both devices. We call that Secret Key - a Brain Key. Brain Key - a strong cryptographic asymmetric key based on Alice’s PASSWORD. 
You can find more information about this key here: https://developer.virgilsecurity.com/docs/java/use-cases/v1/brainkey
So now, let’s take a look at the next step.
Step #3. Store your Private Key in the Cloud
store somewhere encrypted Private Key
At this step:

Alice enters her Password
Alice generates a Brain Key from her password (1)
Alice encrypts her Private Key with the Brain Key (2)
Alice uploads her encrypted private key somewhere in Cloud (to your app’s backend/database)  

As a result, Alice will have her encrypted Private Key in the cloud, that she used to chat with Bob.
Step #4. Alice now uses her new Browser (or new Device)
transmit a Private Key
At this step:

Alice enters her Password (the same that she used previously for Brain Key generation).
This generates her Brain Key (1)
Alice downloads her encrypted Private Key from the Cloud / from your backend/database (2)
Alice decrypts the encrypted Private Key with the Brain Key

As a result, Alice will get her Private Key on a Device B, that she used to chat with Bob on a Device A. This way, the chat conversation survived her device change.
Every time when Alice uses a new device, she can re-generate the same Brain Key and easily get her Private Key, the key that she uses on all her devices to chat with Bob.

The implementations listed on the Wikipedia page for NTRUEncrypt don't have it included, and there's a paper covering the algorithm here but the language is a bit too technical for me to be able to understand it fully.
","Future readers, please prove me wrong (and post your own answer).
Given it is pretty new (November 2013) there probably aren't any implementations at all. Even the authors of the paper might not have implemented it themselves (you could ask them though). But as far as I can tell the protocol only uses operations that would have to be included in NTRUEncrypt implementations anyway. So it shouldn't be to difficult to write one yourself on top of an existing NTRU library. You can ask specific questions on the protocol here or on https://crypto.stackexchange.com. Probably you should try to understand the basics of NTRUEncrypt first, though.

"46647976","Creating Encrypted connection for Amazon Aurora DB with public key","I am using Maria JDBC driver for creating a connection to Amazon Aurora DB
I wanted to create a secured connection so I read here 

To connect to a DB cluster with SSL using the MySQL utility
Download the public key for the Amazon RDS signing certificate from
  https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem.
  Note that this will download a file named rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem.

First Question: How exactly is it secured - anyone can download this pem file from Amazon AWS?
I did some research How should i connect into Aurora DB with public key
and i found these 2 links  First, Second
So my Code is quite Simple:
Class.forName(""org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver"");

Properties prop = new Properties();

prop.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStore"",""C:\\temp\\rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem"");
prop.setProperty(""user"",jdbcDetails.username);
prop.setProperty(""password"",jdbcDetails.getSensitiveData());

    java.sql.Connection conne = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcDetails.connectionString, prop);
    try (Statement stmt1 = conne.createStatement()) {
        // Execute all but the rest
        ResultSet rs = stmt1.executeQuery(""Select 98765 from dual limit 2"");
        while(rs.next()) {

            rs.getLong(1);
        }
    }
    conne.close();

Second Question: How is having the public key file relate to Encryption?
The above information doesn't get along with Oracle Java information that says:

If the client wants to authenticate the server, then the client's trust store must contain the server's certificate

Third Question: From what I understand if the client trust the server it doesn't require him to use this file
Forth Question: I was checking the connection creation with Wireshark
both cases with and without this public key file i was able to create a connection and both cases in Wireshark appeared Encrypted
Something that looks like that:
Encrypted Application Data:
eb:62:45:fb:10:50:f7:8c............:b9:0a:52:e7:97:1d:34

","Base on this answer I understand about public key usage:
First,
It appears that Amazon AWS Azure documentation is misleading a bit - it is only relevant for connection with specific tool called MySQL utility
An answer for First & Second & third Question:

""Java can definitely establish an SSL connection without a client
  validating the certificate chain of the server.""

the key exchange is made to ensure that the server that it's connected to is indeed the one it was expecting (i.e non-suspicious server)
This means that it's still the same SSL connection made, but with verifyServerCertificate=false it does not verify that it is the intended server
Answer Forth Question:
Currect, The code is in Java - and passing the SSL parameter make it encrypted.
So using these parameter gives what requires 
?trustServerCertificate=true&useSSL=true&requireSSL=true&verifyServerCertificate=false

    return gcd;
}

Other than that there is only my function to reduce the amount of operations to point doublings and additions.  I have worked out many examples by hand so I know the data coming out of this function is correct.  
The weird thing is that I have tried this on an example in my cryptography class with values m=17 x=5 y=1 a=2 and I am getting all the values I should be getting.  I didn't code a way for the values to 'wrap around' once the inverse of the base point is reached but since with bitcoin the private key space is much much smaller than the modulo value so we shouldn't even reach that point when values start repeating themselves. I am about to cry with how frustrating this is so any help would be wonderful.  
Oh also there is one other weird thing.  Here is an example when I run it.

It's not obvious but the last 19 hex digits are the same but the rest is different? They are the same length by the way.  Could this be something wrong with the BigInteger Library?  This was a way that seemed simple to me but would you recommend I did it a different way?

","You normally provide the git server with your public key (e.g. as it is done in github - you first have to send them your public key) first. This is then used by the server for authentication. Once you connect to the git server, you sign a message with your private key. This message is validated by the server with your previously provided public key (cf. RFC 4252 section 7). If the server is able to validate the message with your public key it can be sure that you are indeed the person you claim to be.
On the server side, the public key is also used for authentication purposes. The server typically sends its public key to you once you connect via SSH (for RSA cf. e.g.RFC4432) - this is when you are asked to accept a certain public key fingerprint. If you do accept, during this connection and subsequent connections, the server will use its private key to sign a message for generating a session key (more on that in asecond) that is being sent to you. You try to authenticate this message by using the server's public key to be sure you are talking to the right server. The message is then used to derive a symmetric encryption key to be used throughout the rest of the session. 
The purpose for using symmetric keys to do the actual encryption is simply for reasons of performance, symmetric cryptography is much faster. This implies that the asymmetric public/private keys are merely used for authentication purposes.

So:

List item
Our system has multiple companies
Each company has multiple users
Each company can create multiple auctions
Other companies can then submit their bids for the available auctions. A bid consists of hundreds or thousands of individual items, and we would just need to encrypt the 'price' section of these records.

The problem that we're facing is that our large customers do not want us to ever have access to the bid prices, at least while the bidding is in progress, which is totally understandable. Right now, we are simply encrypting the prices via a symmetric encryption, so even though the prices are effectively encrypted in the database, their concern is that we have the key to decrypt the prices.
We're thus looking at some form of public key encryption system.
Here is our initial thoughts on the solution:

When a company signs up, we create a public/private keypair using OpenSSL for it and we save it in S3 or straight into the database. For this to be really useful, we would enforce the user to use a strong password for the private key, which would of course not be saved in the database.
When a company submits a bid for an auction, we encrypt the prices using the public key of the auction's owner company and we save them into the database.
When the auction bidding period is over and the issuing company wants to generate the report the first time, we ask him to input his password and use that along with his company's private key to decrypt the prices.
To make subsequent traffic faster, we cache the decrypted data (and maybe encrypt it using a simple symetrical encryption system)

So here are the questions (and we're unfortunately not security experts, so sorry if those are stupid questions):

Does this make any sense or is it a totally ludicrous or overkill solution?
Would we generate the keys using OpenSSL, OpenPGP or another solution?
What happens if a user wants to change his password or generate a new key? Would there be no other way but to decrypt/re-encode everything with the new key?
What would some of the pitfalls be with this solution?
Are there any better solutions that you could recommend?

","To be clear: I have a hunch that your clients are probably not willing to sacrifice all of the conveniences that come with having your system manage some of the cryptography; you should probably present several options and their weaknesses vs convenience.
General Points
Before anything else, you start start with an explicit threat model, covering every possible attack you can think of.  Even if you choose not to address some of the attacks (it's unrealistic to handle everything), you'll ferret out the more obvious attacks, and have at least a basic set of steps for handling others should they occur.
Re: Does this make any sense?
I think the general premise, while overkill on the part of your customers, makes sense from a security perspective.  Your clients want a cryptographically secure system; fair enough.
However, some points on your proposed solution:

By allowing the client to pass their password over the wire, an attacker (which your client seems to think could be you) needs to only man in the middle that password to gain access to the pricing data.

SSL helps mitigate this, but an errant log line somewhere along the line could very well expose the client's password by accident.


The only truly cryptographically secure way (as I see it) for the client to ensure that you don't have access to the pricing data is for them to encrypt it, and your system just acts as a broker for the encrypted data.  This, in effect, makes you a broker of encrypted packets and public keys, but your system should never see private keys.
The question is: are clients willing to manage their own keys, or is that too burdensome to them?  You might be able to automate most of it, at least (client app/website would handle storing the private key locally, and would also be responsible for gathering public keys of the other interested parties in order to decrypt their encrypted bids)
Re: Would we generate the keys using OpenSSL, OpenPGP, or another solution?
Really doesn't matter all that much; each of those options just define the container format for the public/private keys and any metadata.  Use whichever one fits your language/platform best.
The main decision point should be in which encryption algorithm and key strength: RSA-2048?  RSA-4096?  elliptic curve?  something else?
Specific to Ruby: You're probably just going to want to use the OpenSSL library, since it's part of the standard library.  But to reiterate my point above: It's even better if your servers never even see the private keys (if the clients are ok with the trade off of better security over convenience)
Re: What happens if a user wants to change his password or generate a new key?
Changing a password is trivial: the private key its self is just encrypted w/ some symmetric algorithm.  Changing the password involves decrypting the existing key, and re-encrypting it with the new key.  If the client were to lose their password, there is no recovery.
Generating a new key is probably safer, but requires more diligence on your part (encrypted payloads will need to identify which key they match, and clients could have multiple keys active at a time).  This is a good thing, though; it is a common practice to rotate keys regularly, even if they are not compromised.

I am a bit sceptical about this step. If you (the developer company) generate both the public and the private key used for the encryption it means you are 50% into being able to break the encryption. The only thing that protects your customer is the password, which you might be able to bruteforce (i am not suggesting that you will but you have the ability to do so)
If you will use PKI (or what you have described) you need to ensure that the key creation does not happen on your system. The client should create the pair on their systems and then provide you with their publoic key which you will use to encrypt the prices. The client then will be able to decrypt using the private key on which they have sole control

What would some of the pitfalls be with this solution?

The pitfall is that you are making a complex solution. Especially if you follow my advice above, then you place your trust on the customer to not ""lose"" the private key (and/or password) or else they won't be able to decrypt the prices. In addition, if the key leaks from their side, it's difficult to prove that your application is ""innocent""

Would we generate the keys using OpenSSL, OpenPGP or another solution?

In order to prevent the pitfall of a customer losing a key, you might want to look into PGP (the commercial version does this for sure) and into the concept of ADK (additional decryption key) and ""split keys"". The idea is that besides encrypting with the public key of the customer you also encrypt with a ""corporate"" key which can only be used if y out of x number of people come together (as an example, 10 people can possess parts of the key and if 6 of them come together they can reconstruct the key). The parts can be shared amongst your company, the client, their lawyer, etc

"13749677","How to fully encrypt data in Ruby using Private Key encryption?","First, some info on our system, which is basically an eTendering solution for the construction industry.
So:

List item
Our system has multiple companies
Each company has multiple users
Each company can create multiple auctions
Other companies can then submit their bids for the available auctions. A bid consists of hundreds or thousands of individual items, and we would just need to encrypt the 'price' section of these records.

The problem that we're facing is that our large customers do not want us to ever have access to the bid prices, at least while the bidding is in progress, which is totally understandable. Right now, we are simply encrypting the prices via a symmetric encryption, so even though the prices are effectively encrypted in the database, their concern is that we have the key to decrypt the prices.
We're thus looking at some form of public key encryption system.
Here is our initial thoughts on the solution:

When a company signs up, we create a public/private keypair using OpenSSL for it and we save it in S3 or straight into the database. For this to be really useful, we would enforce the user to use a strong password for the private key, which would of course not be saved in the database.
When a company submits a bid for an auction, we encrypt the prices using the public key of the auction's owner company and we save them into the database.
When the auction bidding period is over and the issuing company wants to generate the report the first time, we ask him to input his password and use that along with his company's private key to decrypt the prices.
To make subsequent traffic faster, we cache the decrypted data (and maybe encrypt it using a simple symetrical encryption system)

So here are the questions (and we're unfortunately not security experts, so sorry if those are stupid questions):

Does this make any sense or is it a totally ludicrous or overkill solution?
Would we generate the keys using OpenSSL, OpenPGP or another solution?
What happens if a user wants to change his password or generate a new key? Would there be no other way but to decrypt/re-encode everything with the new key?
What would some of the pitfalls be with this solution?
Are there any better solutions that you could recommend?

","So here's my suggestion, if you want to solve this using encryption...

Each user and each company should generate OpenPGP (or GnuPG) asymmetric public/private key pairs
Each of those public keys should be uploaded to a public key server
Companies could optionally ""sign"" the public keys of the individual users, to designate a trust relationship with those users (and revoke that signature if that relationship changes)
The auctioneer or non-partisan arbiter would also generate a key pair and push that public key to the public key server
As part of an auction registration process, each user would import the public key of the auctioneer, and the auctioneer would import the public key of each user
A trusted third party, perhaps a SaaS vendor outside of the auctioneer, would host a service through which users and the auctioneer would communicate
Bidding users would create a bid by


signing their bid with their private key
encrypting their proposed price to two keys: their own public key and the auctioneer's public key
submitting their bid to the trusted third party service, which would need to enforce an embargo on any user retrieving bids before the auction expiration

At auction end, and only after auction end, the auctioneer retrieves all of the bids, decrypts them, and verifies signatures

A couple of key points:

It's essential that no user or company private keys are ever shared or stored within the service -- that's the only real ""flaw"" I see in your proposed methodology in your question.  If that's the case, it would be very possible for one user to accuse an administrator of ""fraud"" or ""tampering"" with bids, as an administrator of your server would ultimately have access to the private keys of all users, since you've generated them yourself.
Along those same lines, it's essential that any an all communication and ""bids"" are cryptographically ""signed"" with the truly private keys by each user.  This is how you would know that a bid came from one particular user and only that user, and that the bid could not have been tampered with.
Encrypting the bids to the public keys of the bidding user and the auctioneer ensures that the third party SaaS vendor has no introspection into the bids themselves during the blackout period while the auction is open.  I believe this is the most important point to solving your problem as described.
Note that it might actually be preferred to encrypt each bid to a ring of all of the bidding users, if by design you want to make all bids public after the auction is closed.  That would be a slight modification to my algorithm as described above.

In the interest of full disclosure and perhaps some subtle marketing, I happen to be the architect and CTO of a company called Gazzang who has implemented a product called zTrustee which operates exactly as described above ;-)

but you have to handle all the stuff about the way how the key is represented, i.e. how the specific parts of the key are stored in a file, etc
your private key consists of some numbers, usually like this:
d (private exponent), N (common modulus) P,Q (two very large primes) dP and dQ (intermediate values for a computational shortcut ... ignore them for your task)
what you want to do is to calculate PHI = (P-1)*(Q-1) and then run the extended euclidean algorithm (see wikipedia for that) for d and PHI to find the multiplicative inverse element of d mod PHI ... this element is e (public exponent)
your public key then is the tuple (e, N)

I'm also not sure if the previous command is the right one to rebuild the app correctly.
Any help will be appreciated a lot, thanks in advance.
","Solved. I just created a new secret connected to a new key with
oc secrets new-sshauth sshsecret2 --ssh-privatekey=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa

so changing the name from sshsecret to sshsecret2 and repeated the above process. Apparently the previous secret was not configured properly.
I would also like to thank the Upwork freelancer Dwi Prihandi for having contributed to the problem.

GitLab will automatically register your public key with Bitbucket as a
  deploy key for the repositories to be imported. Your public key needs
  to be at ~/.ssh/bitbucket_rsa.pub, which will expand to
  /home/git/.ssh/bitbucket_rsa.pub in most configurations.

The fact is I don't have a /home/git. How could I know, then, where I must create the public key, so that GitLab notices it and registers it automatically?
","The home directory for the git User in an Omnibus install is by default /var/opt/gitlab. You can either check your gitlab.rb config file for the key user['home'] and see if you have modified it or do a cat /etc/passwdand find the home diretory for the user git there.
Default value user['home'](remember the # means it is commented out):
# user['home'] = ""/var/opt/gitlab""
Output of cat /etc/passwd | grep git:
git:x:1000:1000:git,,,:/var/opt/gitlab:/bin/sh
Once you have found out where the home directory for the user git is, you can put bitbucket_rsa.pub in the folder .ssh. If it doesn't exist you can create that folder.

How to generate signing key with such a fancy public key?
","That's the ECMA Standard defined public key.
It's to deal with three conflicting requirements:

A mechanism that ensures that assemblies are signed by their creators and could not have been created by a fraudulent other party.
That CLI be defined openly in such a way that other people are free to implement a version (Mono would be a real-life example).
That there be a standard library of classes made available with every version of the framework.

These three things can't happen at the same time!
If I create a version of .NET (point 2), then I need to provide a version of the standard library (point 3), which needs to be trusted (point 1), so I need to sign it to prove that I'm Microsoft. Oh wait, I'm not Microsoft! (eh, point 2 again).
Instead what happens is:

I create a public-private key pair. People trusted to build new release versions of the assemblies in my framework library implementation have access to the private key, the public key can be known to anyone doing any work on the CLI implementation.
I mark the relevant assemblies as having been signed with the key corresponding to the public key 00000000000000000400000000000000 (defined in the ECMA standard), though really they were signed with the private key mentioned above.
In the code in the CLI any check on an assembly that claims to have been signed with the key corresponding to the public key 00000000000000000400000000000000 is checked with the real public key. If this checks out, then it can only have been signed by someone we trust in building those assemblies.

Of course, MS's framework won't trust our assemblies, Mono's won't trust them, and we won't trust either of theirs, because we all have different real keys corresponding to the ECMA standard key. Which is as it should be.
Meanwhile, the fact that 00000000000000000400000000000000 doesn't match any real valid public key means it's not possible for it to clash with any other public key.

","This is NOT the proper answer to the question. The only thing this answer provides is the pointer to ECMA standard, apparently ECMA-335 with CLI specs. But this ECMA standard provides only a basic definition in terms of unique/fixed value and the name it should be called. Otherwise, it provides nothing about how and where the actual public key is found. The value 00000000000000000400000000000000 is NOT a public key, it is only a marker called Standard Public Key which has nothing to do with a real public key. This value is used to compute Public Key Token for the assembly that uses it but this value is not used to as any public key of RSA algorithm when processing the assembly signature.

"35020850","Why does the Java KeyStore fail at loading an OpenPGP key?","I am willing to spend some amount of time developing yet another license manager for desktop Java application. After some looking around I discovered JCPUID by Iakin that is free to use and should work at most operating systems with native libs that I found here.
My idea is to do two modules: main application that will show popup window with CPU ID and verification text field and key generator app. User will pass CPU ID to keygen owner, who will return verification code (generated with keygen) to user. After user submits correct verification code, license file with that code will be created at filesystem. Every time the application starts up, it will check the existence and correctness of that file and load main application screen after that.
What about code verification, I think the best option will be to use asymmetric cryptography, in particular RSA. The public key will be built-in into application and secret will be built-in into key generator. So CPUID will be passed to key generator owner and then signed with RSA. That signature will be transferred back to user, who will verify its validity with built-in public key.
I generated gpg key pairs using Kleopatra and gpg Linux command line tool itself. Then I tried to sign something using this method:
    private byte[] createSignature(byte[] file) {
    byte[] signature = null;

    try {
        java.security.KeyStore keyStoreFile = java.security.KeyStore
                .getInstance(""PKCS12"");
        keyStoreFile.load(getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(""/secret.asc""),
        ""******"".toCharArray());

        PrivateKey privateKey = (PrivateKey) keyStoreFile.getKey(
                ""My Name Here"", ""******"".toCharArray());

        Signature dsa = Signature.getInstance(""SHA1withRSA"");
        dsa.initSign(privateKey);
        dsa.update(file, 0, file.length);
        signature = dsa.sign();

    } catch (Exception e) {
        // TODO Auto-generated catch block
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return signature;
}

But the privateKey initialization throws exception:
java.security.InvalidKeyException: Key must not be null

I guess it's because of wrong instance format here:
java.security.KeyStore keyStoreFile = java.security.KeyStore
            .getInstance(""PKCS12"");

I would like to know:

How good is this approach at all?
What difference exists between different OpenPGP key formats and which will be the best to use at this case? How to know the format of existing OpenPGP file?

","The Java crypto framework does not support OpenPGP. X.509 keys, for example in the PKCS12 format, are incompatible with OpenPGP -- although they rely on (mostly) the same cryptographic algorithms.
Either use X.509 certificates (you could also create your own CA for this purpose), or rely on an implementation of OpenPGP for Java. In terms of open source libraries, you can choose between the native Java implementation BouncyCastle (MIT license), or interface GnuPG (GPL) through the Java GPGME binding (LGPL).
BouncyCastle is probably the better way to go, as all you need to do is add another Java library, not install another software into the system.

You can't.
Private keys cannot be generated from public keys. This is absolutely fundamental to public key cryptography.

I get the following errors..

NameError: name 'addr' is not defined

You must define or initialize addr before using it.

TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable

See TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable in Python

IndentationError: unexpected indent

Python depends on indentation as part of its syntax, for example indentation is used to define blocks where other languages might use { and } or begin and end.
If you have too much or too little indentation it alters the meaning of the code and may not make any sense. You must pay careful attention to indentation when using Python.
In particular, I suspect that if you set tab-spacing to other than 8 and irregularly mix tabs with spaces in indentation, you will have problems.

Assume A only receives messages that are bit strings of length at most log n, which can be 
mapped to Zn.
Also assume that B cannot simply send c as his own email to A and expect a reply, but that A will respond to email messages other than c.
How can B learn m using only c, e, n and random values from Zn? 
","From wikipedia:

RSA has the property that the product
  of two ciphertexts is equal to the
  encryption of the product of the
  respective plaintexts. That is m1^e m2^e≡(m1m2)^e (mod n) Because
  of this multiplicative property a
  chosen-ciphertext attack is possible.
  E.g. an attacker, who wants to know
  the decryption of a ciphertext c = m^e
  (mod n) may ask the holder of the
  private key to decrypt an
  unsuspicious-looking ciphertext c' =
  cr^e (mod n) for some value r chosen by
  the attacker. Because of the
  multiplicative property c' is the
  encryption of mr (mod n). Hence, if
  the attacker is successful with the
  attack, he will learn mr (mod n) from
  which he can derive the message m by
  multiplying mr with the modular
  inverse of r modulo n.

That's actually pretty neat, thanks for asking the question that lead me to learning this.
As for your question of 3020 vs 600, it's multiplicative; rarely are concatenations used in mathematics, since after all we should always be working independent of base.

Is it possible that my key has been tampered with somehow?

Yes, it always possible and you can't rule it out, however is it likely to be the case, I would doubt it. (Of course it depends what are doing with your server).
Most of the time it will be some service or some configuration which has been change but not applied until later i.e. server restart or other automatic process restart.
Anyway here is very similar ticket to yours. Where I have provided how you can investigate very same issue.
Assuming that you don't have off site logging, any remote configuration management software (Puppet, Ansibel, Cheef et.c) or another user you can try to ssh as.
The only option to investigate this further in my opinion would be (Assuming that you don't want to shut down the server):

Take snapshot of the root volume of your affected instance.
Create a volume out of the snapshot.
Mount the new volume on a good working instance.
Go to the mounted volume and investigate.

I have setup the community version (V4). I have 2 web servers with replicated content, I have a virtual IP setup in the system which points to the 2 IP addresses of the web servers. The load balancer works for HTTP and HTTPS traffic correctly but shows an cert error when trying to get to the servers via HTTPS.
I want to combat this by adding a certificate to the load balancer. To do this I have followed the these steps:
https://www.zevenet.com/knowledge-base/howtos/manage-certificates-with-zen-load-balancer/ (ignoring the bit about purchasing a cert from SofIntel as we use JISC for our Certs)
Basically I created a certificate in the load balancer, generated the CSR, purchased a certificate from JISC by uploading the CSR generated from the load balancer. 
I then downloaded the ZIP file from JISC which contains the crt for the domain, as well as the root certificates required also in the ZIP.
I tried uploading the ZIP to the load balancer and it pops up an error showing that the certificate needs to be created in a PEM format.
I then found this here:
https://www.zevenet.com/knowledge-base/howtos/create-certificates-pem-format/
I am not really sure what this is asking me to do....does this mean the original CSR that I generated is irrelevant now? The instructions on the above link say that the PEM file needs to be the following:
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- Private Key (without passphrase) -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----- 
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- Certificate (CN=www.mydomain.com) -----END CERTIFICATE----- 
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- Intermediate (Intermediate CA, if exists) -----END CERTIFICATE----- 
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- Root (ROOT CA, who signs the Certificate) -----END CERTIFICATE-----

Essentially I already have the domain certificate, the intermediate and the root all from JISC now. But is there any way  can go about getting the Private key from the load balancer so that I can just create the PEM file manually.
I am pretty new to cert stuff, not sure why it wont just let me upload the zip file.

Here is a code sample of what I tried:
 File fXmlFile = new File("".....\\...\\...\\file.xml""); //Path to xml file
 DocumentBuilderFactory dbFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
 DocumentBuilder dBuilder = dbFactory.newDocumentBuilder();
 Document doc = dBuilder.parse(fXmlFile);
 doc.getDocumentElement().normalize();

 NodeList nList = doc.getElementsByTagName(""Modulus"");
 Node n = nList.item(0);

 byte[] encKey = Base64.getEncoder().encode(n.getTextContent().getBytes());

 X509EncodedKeySpec pubKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(encKey);
 KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""DSA"", ""SUN"");
 PublicKey pubKey = keyFactory.generatePublic(pubKeySpec);

At the last line I get an exception that looks like this:
java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException: Inappropriate key specification: invalid key format
at sun.security.provider.DSAKeyFactory.engineGeneratePublic(DSAKeyFactory.java:119)
at java.security.KeyFactory.generatePublic(KeyFactory.java:328)
at XmlReader.main(XmlReader.java:41)

I'm not to sure what the issue is with the key format. Could it be an issue with the input being converted into a string that is causing it to lose some important data for the key?
","You are building a RSA key with a DSA KeyFactory, and using X509EncodedKeySpec while you have modulus and exponent encoded in base64
Try this:
BigInteger modulus = new BigInteger(Base64.getDecoder().decode(modulusAsString));
BigInteger exponent =  new BigInteger(Base64.getDecoder().decode(exponentAsString));

RSAPublicKeySpec keySpec = new RSAPublicKeySpec(modulus, exponent);
KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
PublicKey pubKey =keyFactory.generatePublic(keySpec);

Match Group sftp
    PasswordAuthentication yes
    ForceCommand internal-sftp
    ChrootDirectory %h

That works fine, however, I have a user that wants to use SFTP with public key. I have that user set up and SSH works perfectly fine, however, when I add the user to the ""sftp"" group, authentication stops. I do not want this user to be able to SSH in and I want to Chroot them to their home directory.
I checked that root owns the home directory and that it's not writeable by other groups. The following debugging info isn't leading me anywhere useful either:
sftp -vv -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa testuser@serveraddress

Gives the following:
...
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password
debug1: Next authentication method: publickey
debug1: Offering RSA public key: /Users/myuser/.ssh/id_rsa
debug2: we sent a publickey packet, wait for reply
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password
debug2: we did not send a packet, disable method
debug1: Next authentication method: password
tester@serveraddress's password:

Any ideas why it seems to be just completely ignoring the key? Again, if I remove the user from the ""sftp"" group, logging in with key works fine.

","You haven't set up your SSH keys between EC2 and Github correctly based on the error message, but given the information you've provided, it's not possible to provide suggestions.  
Question - have you set up a deploy key on the EC2 server?  I'm assuming that you are trying to deploy from the EC2 server and not your local machine using SSH Agent Forwarding.  Can you do a git pull from the EC2 server to the github account?  Can you ssh to git@github.com (e.g. ""ssh -T git@github.com"")?

Is it all reversed or just part of it (e.g. the modulus at the end)? 52 53 41 31 is a string of RSA1. 
My key's modulus is 1024 bit, so I was looking for something that described the length.
0x0400 (00 04 B.E.) would be 1024 (bits), 0x80 would be 128 (bytes, 1024/8).

","On the sender, you get the signature and save it as binary into a file
On the receiver, you read the signature from the file as it is text, then take the first line.
just replace this:
sig=f.readlines()
signature=sig[0]

by
signature=f.read()

If you want to stick with the ""text"" mode, you need to encode the signature in base64 and write it to the file, and in receiver side, read the first line, and decode the base64. To do that : 
On sender, you can set : 
f.write(signature.encode('base64').replace('\n', ''))

and on receiver: 
sig=f.readlines()
signature=sig[0].decode(""base64"")

","Consider using WebCrypto
Specifically, crypto.subtle.generateKey will do the key generation.

The key can be temporary as long as you discard it securely and/or invalidate it after its desired validity period has expired.  Depending on how your system works, you may want to validate the expiry/validity of a given key by rolling it into the hash.
Here is a tutorial which offers a cross-browser solution.
Hashing the key (and/or other data) can be done using other parts of the WebCrypto API (see crypto.subtle.digest)

Strong recommendation:
You should have different set of key pairs for every environment, so in a minimal setup you shouldn't define the lexik_jwt_authentication not in your config.yml but twice, in your config_dev.yml and your config_prod.yml and and have a different set of pem files for dev and prod.

","I think using SN to generate certificates for signing (using the RSACryptoServiceProvider at least) is unsupported. That would explain the error, I think. What you're looking for, in Windows, is a .PFX file (i.e. certificate with key) and .CER file (certificate without private key).
SN (MSDN link) doesn't provide security, and is only used for identity. You can use IIS or makecert.exe to generate a self-signed certificate that should work with what you're trying to do (i.e. a .PFX file and / or certificate already imported into the Windows certificate store). You can then extract the .CER file from that and use it for your project.

","I'll accepted Shaamaan answer because he is ""half"" right. You can actually use SN to sign certificate. ImportCspBlob() will work! However, when you tried to to import public key that generated using sn -p Warehouse.snk WarehousePublic.snk, it won't work.

            {
                rsa.ImportCspBlob(bytes);
                using (StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(File.Open(args[1], FileMode.Create, FileAccess.ReadWrite, FileShare.ReadWrite)))
                    sw.Write(rsa.ToXmlString(false));
            }
        }
    }
}

After you compile it, to use the executable simply call:
ExtractPublicKey.exe [SNK File with Private Key] [Output Public Key in XML File]
To use the embedded certificate, simply do:
RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();
rsa.FromXmlString(stream.ReadToEnd());

I hope this help someone that come across the similar problem.

","I don't know your exact use case but you could consider taking a look at Hashicorp Vault. It has a PKI secrets plugin which lets you storing public/private key pairs. If it fits your use case this might be a good read, as at least someone else has thought about storing it securely.
The nice thing about vault is that in theory (this depends on the plugin that's being used) you could create a situation where the private keys are completely managed by vault and your messages are being authenticated with the vault. This will make it hard for an attacker to get your private keys. However, you might end up needing to write your own vault plugin to get this completely working with your application.

"54548803","Retrieve ECDSA public key from only x-compressed coordinate using Crypto++ library","I'm implementing a security daemon on the vehicular communication scope.
I could receive a message with a signature and the compressed X coordinate of a point to verify that signature. The elliptic curve can be either the secp256 or the brainpoolp256r1 and the algorithm is ECDSA.
My question is: how can I recover the ECC Point (and so the public key) given only the compressed X coordinate with the Crypto++ library?
I followed some links which explain it (and many others) https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Point_Compression Crypto++ and Compressed EC keys but they don't fit my problem.
I tried to produce code to resolve the problem, but it won't work:
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <cryptopp/cryptlib.h>
#include <cryptopp/ecp.h>
#include <cryptopp/eccrypto.h>
#include <cryptopp/hex.h>
#include <cryptopp/oids.h>
#include <cryptopp/osrng.h>

using namespace CryptoPP;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::string;

int main() 
{
    string compactPoint = ""937120662418500f3ad7c892b1db7e7c2d85ec48c74e99d64dcb7083082bb4f3"";

    AutoSeededRandomPool generator;
    ECDSA<ECP, SHA256>::PublicKey pubKey;

    pubKey.GetGroupParameters().GetCurve().DecodePoint (point, ss, ss.MaxRetrievable());

    std::cout << ""Result after decompression X: "" << std::hex << point.x << std::endl;
    std::cout << ""Result after decompression Y: "" << std::hex << point.y << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

Can you help me please?
","The easiest solution is probably to prepend ""02"" oe ""03"" to the compact representation. Crypto++ will then decode it as a compressed public key.
$ cat test.cxx

#include ""cryptlib.h""
#include ""eccrypto.h""
#include ""ecp.h""
#include ""hex.h""
#include ""oids.h""

#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    using namespace CryptoPP;

    ECDSA<ECP, SHA256>::PublicKey pubKey;
    pubKey.AccessGroupParameters().Initialize(ASN1::secp256r1());

    std::string compactPoint = ""02"" /* compressed */
        ""937120662418500f3ad7c892b1db7e7c""

    pubKey.GetGroupParameters().GetCurve().DecodePoint (point, ss, ss.MaxRetrievable());

    std::cout << ""Result after decompression X: "" << std::hex << point.x << std::endl;
    std::cout << ""Result after decompression Y: "" << std::hex << point.y << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

And then building and running the program. Notice the library solves for the y portion of the coordinate.
cryptopp$ g++ test.cxx ./libcryptopp.a -o test.exe
cryptopp$ ./test.exe
Result after decompression X: 937120662418500f3ad7c892b1db7e7c2d85ec48c74e99d64dcb7083082bb4f3h
Result after decompression Y: cfcaf74eae3ceec5993928f04970cfef343b9a6b22727fa81926bd21f256ec56h


And to save you the trouble of looking it up, you can set the public element for publicKey using:
pubKey.SetPublicElement(point);

std::cout << ""X: "" << std::hex << pubKey.GetPublicElement().x << std::endl;
std::cout << ""Y: "" << std::hex << pubKey.GetPublicElement().y << std::endl;

Running with the additional code produces the expected result:
$ ./test.exe
Result after decompression X: 937120662418500f3ad7c892b1db7e7c2d85ec48c74e99d64dcb7083082bb4f3h

If interested, here is the code you are using to decode the point from ecp.cpp:
bool ECP::DecodePoint(ECP::Point &P, BufferedTransformation &bt, size_t encodedPointLen) const
{
    byte type;
    if (encodedPointLen < 1 || !bt.Get(type))
        return false;

    switch (type)
    {
    case 0:
        P.identity = true;
        return true;
    case 2:
    case 3:
    {
        if (encodedPointLen != EncodedPointSize(true))
            return false;

        Integer p = FieldSize();

        P.identity = false;
        P.x.Decode(bt, GetField().MaxElementByteLength());
        P.y = ((P.x*P.x+m_a)*P.x+m_b) % p;

        if (Jacobi(P.y, p) !=1)
            return false;

        P.y = ModularSquareRoot(P.y, p);

        if ((type & 1) != P.y.GetBit(0))
            P.y = p-P.y;

        return true;
    }
    case 4:
    {
        if (encodedPointLen != EncodedPointSize(false))
            return false;

        unsigned int len = GetField().MaxElementByteLength();
        P.identity = false;
        P.x.Decode(bt, len);
        P.y.Decode(bt, len);
        return true;
    }
    default:
        return false;
    }
}

I mention it in case you want to solve for the y coordinate yourself, populate the point, and then call SetPublicElement directly.

You can also prepend 03 instead of 02. The difference is, the decoding returns either y or p-y. The variability is introduced due to the modular square root shown above. We need to see the generation algorithm to determine what the value should be.
Here is the difference when using 03 instead of 02:
$ ./test.exe
X: 937120662418500f3ad7c892b1db7e7c2d85ec48c74e99d64dcb7083082bb4f3h
Y: 303508b051c3113b66c6d70fb68f3010cbc46595dd8d8057e6d942de0da913a9h

Notice 03 produces the y coordinate 303508b051c3113b66c6d70fb68f3010cbc46595dd8d8057e6d942de0da913a9h instead of 02 and cfcaf74eae3ceec5993928f04970cfef343b9a6b22727fa81926bd21f256ec56h.

The way PGP, S/MIME and other similar messaging solutions enable a multi-party message is to:
1. Generate a Message Encryption Key (MEK), for example, an AES key for use with mode GCM,
2. Look up the public key of each recipient,
3. Encrypt the MEK to each recipient's public key,
4. Package the encrypted MEKs with the encrypted message,
5. Distribute to participants.
The challenge here is the secure discovery of public keys, most applications punt on this and make the user do manual thumbprint verification or rely on a third-party such as a Certificate Authority to verify the binding of a key to a subject.
You can find an example that does this using webcrypto with a single recipient here:
https://pkijs.org/examples/CMSEnvelopedExample.html

What they are asking is the following:

Certificate with 4096 bits public key for encryption (.pem or .cer

SSL certificate for sending callback response on call back URL.

I generated the self-signed SSL certificate using OpenSSL & shared with them along with the private key (I know we shouldn't). They asked me to share a valid public key & SSL certificate. 
I even generated a certificate & private key on DigiCert, but couldn't figure out how to generate a public key for SSL Certificate.  
Can anyone kindly suggest how to generate Public key & private key for the SSL Certificate? 
Kindly also suggest if I can use Comodo or DigiCert to generate a public key for the SSL certificate?
","An SSL Certificate is a public key verified and signed by a Certificate Authority. You generate a public/private key pair, then from that generate a Certificate Signing Request (which includes the public key), which you send to the CA. It then signs that public key included in the CSR producing the certificate which is sends back to you. See also here.
It sounds like you already have this though, so you'd need to clarify what you're trying to achieve. It sounds like it may be a client authentication / mutual authentication scenario? If so, it depends on what the service provider requires - certificates for client authentication may need to be signed either by a public authority that the server trusts, or by the server itself.

every thing looks fine from token generation part to getting public and private key but verification part is not working. It is printing false for the key pair generated. It was working fine with key pair I got from online tool(which I can't use due to licensing problem) but not when I generated keys.
","The problem is here:
String publicKey  = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(keyGen.genKeyPair().getPublic().getEncoded());
String privateKey = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(keyGen.genKeyPair().getPrivate().getEncoded());

Every time you call genKeyPair() a new key pair is generated. Thus publicKey and privateKey come from different and unrelated key pairs. The solution is simply to save the key pair just generated, e.g.
KeyPair kp = keyGen.genKeyPair();
String publicKey  = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(kp.getPublic().getEncoded());
String privateKey = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(kp.getPrivate().getEncoded());

NOTE: there may be other problems with the code, this is the first one I spotted.

"29695955","Public key authentication in Safari","I've implemented public key authentication on my website to allow users to sign in without using a password. They can request a certificate once they're signed in (the normal way). In the backend, a new certificate is generated using a self-signed server certificate. In the Apache config, the client side certificate is set to optional, in order to allow users to sign in without a certificate as well.
This all works splendidly, but there's a problem when visiting the website from Safari. When the website is visited for the first time, the browser offers to use a Apple-generated certificate, and the default Safari option is to do so. My server is of course unable to verify this certificate, because it was signed by Apple and not my server. The result is that users get a certificate error and can't visit the website. If a user denies to use the Apple provided certificate, everything works as expected and the user is able to log in normally.

The problem is, if the user clicks continue on the first visit (using the Apple-signed certificate), this is remembered in the keychain. This makes the website unaccessible unless one removes the entry in the keychain, which is a pain.

Did anyone encounter this error, which makes it virtually impossible to work with public key authentication for the majority of people?

  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

I understand that the fingerprint is a Base64 string of the SHA256 hash of the public key.
I know how to generate this fingerprint with a RSAPublicKey:
    RSAPublicKey publicKey = ...;

    ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    DataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(byteArrayOutputStream);

    dataOutputStream.writeInt(""ssh-rsa"".getBytes().length);

    byte[] result = digest.digest(byteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray());

    String fingerprint = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(result);

But how can I do this with a BCECPublicKey?
UPDATE
I found out that the BCECPublicKey isn't similar to RSAPublicKey at all. I never knew that the SSH server public key is ECDSA and the client public key is RSA.  
Also the way the bytes are structured is way different. The RSA public key starts with a header(ssh-rsa). The header length can be read from the first 4 bytes(readInt()). But when I do this with the ECDSA the length is way to long to represent a header...
Addition to answer
Something to copy paste:
    BCECPublicKey publicKey = ...;

    byte[] point = SubjectPublicKeyInfo.getInstance(ASN1Sequence.getInstance(publicKey.getEncoded())).getPublicKeyData().getOctets();

    ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    DataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(byteArrayOutputStream);

    dataOutputStream.writeInt(""ecdsa-sha2-nistp256"".getBytes().length);
    dataOutputStream.write(""ecdsa-sha2-nistp256"".getBytes());
    dataOutputStream.writeInt(""nistp256"".getBytes().length);
    dataOutputStream.write(""nistp256"".getBytes());
    dataOutputStream.writeInt(point.length);
    dataOutputStream.write(point);

    MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA256"");
    byte[] result = digest.digest(byteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray());

    String fingerprint = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(result);

","The OpenSSH publickey format (and the SSH wire format on which it is based) does start with the type, but for ECDSA the type includes the curve id. As an example, one of my test systems has an ecdsa/p256 key as follows:
$ awk '{print $2}' <id_ecdsa.pub |openssl base64 -d -A |xxd

0000060: dd39 396e d72d 1e40                      .99n.-.@

That consists of:
4 bytes 00000013 bigendian int = 19: length of type
19 bytes 'ecdsa-sha2-nistp256' type
4 bytes 00000008 bigendian int = 8: length of curveid
8 bytes 'nistp256' curveid (redundant, but that's the wire format)
4 bytes 00000041 bigendian int = 65: length of pub point
65 bytes beginning 04: pub point in X9.62 format, copied more conveniently in SEC1, which is 1 byte 04=uncompressed, N bytes X-coordinate, N bytes Y-coordinate where N is the (fixed) size needed to represent the curve's underlying field as unsigned.
These are mostly defined in rfc5656 section 3.1 and the curveid's in 6.1. The RFC allows compressed point format, but OpenSSH doesn't use that option.
BCECPublicKey.getEncoded() (like all Java PublicKey classes) returns a so-called X.509 (really SubjectPublicKeyInfo, SPKI) encoding which for EC includes the public point in X9.62 uncompressed format, but you need some parsing to extract it. Since you have BC, it's easiest to use that:
byte[] point = SubjectPublicKeyInfo.getInstance(ASN1Sequence.getInstance(encoded)).getPublicKeyData().getOctets();

Alternatively .getW() and .getQ() get the point as a JCE or BC class, from either of which you can get the (affine) X and Y coordinates as BigInteger resp. ECFieldElement which in turn yields BigInteger, and each BigInteger can be converted to a variable-sized byte array which you must then left-pad or left-truncate to the correct size. 
The result is the data to be hashed. In case you aren't aware, only OpenSSH versions 6.8 up use base64(sha256(pubkey)) for the fingerprint (by default). Before that it was hex-with-colons(md5(pubkey)), and newer versions can do the old fingerprint for compatibility (see option FingerprintHash in ssh_config for ssh and flag -E in ssh-keygen).
And to be clear this is only the OpenSSH fingerprint. Key fingerprints are also used in the PGP and X.509/PKIX (SSL/TLS, CMS/SMIME, etc) worlds and they are entirely different.

I know how to recalculate in JAVA code the Digest Value for comparing with the value stored in DigestValue Element. 
Now I need to complete the next steps for verifying the Signature validity.
I found in this article 3.2.2 Signature Validation on how to do what I want but I don't understand any thing in step 2.
Could anyone help explain step 2 in Java.

"53534454","How to work with elliptic curve SECP256K1 key in Azure Key Vault when the key is used also by a blockchain","I'm wondering how to work with SECP256K1 keys within Azure Key Vault when at the same time the key is also required for account creation on a blockchain.
WHAT HAS TO BE ACHIEVED

Generate SECP256K1 key pair
Use public key for account creation on a blockchain
Store private key to Key Vault and use it for signing purposes

ATTEMPT #1 - GENERATE OUTSIDE KEY VAULT AND IMPORT
I have generated SECP256K1 key pair outside Key Vault. As a result I have private key and public key available as strings.
My idea was to import the private key to Key Vault with help of Azure SDK for.NET wia following piece of code (ECParameters used are from Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault.WebKey.ECParameters namespace):
  //this part of code is taken from https://www.scottbrady91.com/C-Sharp/JWT-Signing-using-ECDSA-in-dotnet-Core
  var privateKeyBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(privateKey);
  var privateKeyInt =
    new Org.BouncyCastle.Math.BigInteger(+1, privateKeyBytes);
  var parameters = SecNamedCurves.GetByName(""secp256k1"");
  var ecPoint = parameters.G.Multiply(privateKeyInt);
  var privateKeyX = ecPoint.Normalize().XCoord.ToBigInteger()
    .ToByteArrayUnsigned();
  var privateKeyY = ecPoint.Normalize().YCoord.ToBigInteger()
    .ToByteArrayUnsigned();

  //the following part is my code
  var ecParameters = new ECParameters();
  ecParameters.Curve = ""P-256K"";
  ecParameters.X = privateKeyX;
  ecParameters.Y = privateKeyY;
  ecParameters.D = privateKeyBytes;

  var key = new JsonWebKey(ecParameters);
  JsonWebKeyVerifier.Options options =
    JsonWebKeyVerifier.Options.DenyIncompatibleOperations
    | JsonWebKeyVerifier.Options.DenyExtraneousFields;
  string error = (string) null;

  JsonWebKeyVerifier.VerifyByKeyType(key, options, ref error);

  await client.ImportKeyWithHttpMessagesAsync(vaultBaseUri, name, key);

The resulting key for import looks like this (copied from Visual Studio variable view, maybe it's shortened):
  {
    ""kty"": ""EC"",
    ""crv"": ""P-256K"",
    ""x"": ""vSUHj6deEhPI6QeILgfgf2I7VTgmiDon_5nsss560OA"",

ATTEMPT #2 - GENERATE WITHIN KEY VAULT AND EXPORT
Even if I'm able to generate SECP256K1 EC key within Key Vault, I didn't find how to export its public key part.
EDIT 11/23/2018
GetKey method on Azure Key Vault returns JsonWebKey that contains X and Y coordinates.
QUESTIONS

Is it possible to import SECP256K1 key via Azure SDK for .NET? If yes, could you provide me a link to working example?
Am I doing something wrong/insufficent in my code during attempt to import the key to Key Vault?
Is it possible to export SECP256K1 public key from Key Vault?
Do you have any other idea how to accomplish the achievements described herein before?

EDIT 11/29/2018

Is there a way how to construct public key from X and Y coordinates (ideally in .NET world)?

Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Jan

","As described, the scheme seems reasonable in that it should allow someone to send another person a message that only the recipient can read.  There are some items that come to mind that you may have already thought about but left out for brevity:

When encrypting the private key, use something like PBKDF2 with salt and some fairly large number it iterations.
This is probably implied, but rather than encrypt with the public key, it probably makes sense to generate a random key (e.g., 32-bytes of random data if using, for example, AES-256). Encrypt the message with that key, encrypt the key with the public key, and send both pieces.
As described, there is no identification of the sender.  It allows purely anonymous messages to be sent. This might be intended, but if not, then some kind of identification/authentication would be necessary.
Somewhat similar to the previous entry, no message authentication is described. The attacker could change the encrypted message and the recipient would not be able to tell that it was changed.  Although, if it is a text message, it would be pretty clear that it had been modified, because it would be just garbled text. There are some types of data, though, that might not be so easy to tell if it had been modified.

","If I understand correctly, you want to create a system where two users can initiate private communication through a server that they do not trust.
This won't work.
In the scenario you lay out, the server can generate its own key pair, and publish its public key in place of the users'. When a user encrypts a message, intending it for their partner, they can't detect that the server has substituted its public key. The server decrypts the message, presents it to the server admins, and re-encrypts it (or some new message that they fabricated) with the real partner public key, and forwards it to the destination.
What's missing here is a certificate authority. This is a trusted third party that digitally signs a binding between a public key and a user name. This binding is called a certificate. This way, when the server presents a public key to a client to use for encryption, the client can use the CA's public key to verify the certificate, and be assured that the public key they are about to encrypt with belongs to the intended recipient, and not an attacker.
The users have to trust the CA, which might be more palatable than trusting the server administrators. But, there must also be a tamper-proof way to store the CA certificate. In practice, this is often done using a password-based MAC (message authentication code). Or, the CA could be digitally signed with the user's private key (never seen this done, but it would work). But the tricky part would be getting the CA certificate from a trusted source, bypassing the untrustworthy server.
As far as encrypting the private key with the password, that is done very often, and is as safe as the password you choose.
Alternatively, if the users can share a secret with each other out-of-band, you don't need public key encryption. The client could encrypt the shared secret with a user-selected password, and store the cipher text on the server.

","This sounds something like what hushmail did. However, there was a major problem in that, since they had the private key of the users (encrypted) they just had to push down a hacked java applet which would transmit the user's password to the server (which they did).
A much better solution is to avoid having that private key on the server at all. With the requirement of no local storage, that's out.
Why not use symmetric encryption via a pre-shared password? It can be done without storage on the client side. I believe this is what @erickson was saying in his last paragraph.

If I use the same public key with each company, and my private key were compromised, I'd need to give each company a new public key.
My school email address appears in my current public key. I'm not sure why this is actually, but I don't think your email has anything to do with the key (or does it?).

","Your question has been asked (and well-answered!) on security.stackexchange.com: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/10203/reusing-private-public-keys
The long and short of it is that yes, you may re-use your public key for multiple accounts, but your first consideration is a little underweight; if your private key were compromised, all of your accounts would be compromised. If the various accounts have different expectations of security, you might want to consider using different key pairs.
Your email address associated with your key is for identification purposes. It has to do with the key in that it is IN the key, but it does not impact the functionality of the key.
If you did generate a different key pair, you can tie different keys to different hosts via ~/.ssh/config. Instructions to do should be pretty easy to find.

The script basically starts a rsync process in a SSH session per file. Details of the script can be found here; http://www.reddipped.com/2016/07/speeding-vm-backups-using-rsync/
To be able to run the script without having to type in a password for each SSH session, public key authentication has been configured.
Client configuration (Mac OS X Sierra)

Create the private/public keypair 

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -C ""rsync""


Fill in random passphrase, e.g. ""rsync protocol""
Copy the public key to the users home directory on the synology
ssh Peter\ van\ Nes@newyork 'mkdir ~/.ssh'
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh Peter\ van\ Nes@newyork 'cat - >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
ssh Peter\ van\ Nes@newyork 'chmod 644 .ssh/authorized_keys'
ssh Peter\ van\ Nes@newyork 'chmod 755 ~ ~/.ssh' 


Server (Synology)

Open SSH session to Synology
ssh ""Peter van Nes""@newyork

Edit sshd_config
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config   
# Enable RSAAuthentication yes     
# Enable PubkeyAuthentication yes
# Enable AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys
# Enable ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
# Add MaxSessions 50
# Add MaxStartups 50:10:100

Restart the services
# restart ssh-shell
synoservicectl --restart ssh-shell
# restart rsync daemon
synoservicectl --restart rsyncd   


After completing these steps i am able to logon using a public key successfully. When running the script it initially runs as expected, only after a few thousand files the passphrase for the key has to be entered again.
I did break the issue down to this little script which reproduces the issue for me.
#!/bin/bash

sessions=0
while true
do
    sessions=$(($sessions + 1))
    echo ""Session "" $sessions
    ssh peter@newyork -x ""ls -al""
done 

After a few thousand sequential SSH sessions the passphrase for the public key is requested again. The sequential successful number of sessions differs per run. This can be 2102 but also 5000+.
Session  2101
total 4
drwxr-xr-x  1 peter users   24 Oct 15 12:46 .

Session  2103
Enter passphrase for key '/Users/petervannes/.ssh/id_rsa': 

When running ssh with the -vvv argument does not give any hints, also the auth.log on the Synology does report any authentications errors. 
Any idea how to debug or fix this?
","Fixed it by adding the certificates to the keychain using ssh-add -K.
#!/bin/bash

ssh-add -K

"37966918","Certificate or Public key pinning slows down Web service response in Android","When I perform pinning (certificate / public key) on web services, in Android. I see that the time taken for the app to receive a response from the web service is close to double the time required without pinning.
This is because, the mechanism of pinning first establishes a connection to retrieve the certificates and validate them, and then goes for a second connection (not sure) to retrieve the response, from the server.
NOTE - In Android, it is advisable to use a connection on demand basis rather than a continuous connection to save power and bandwidth, on the device for the end user (unless required)
I would like to know if there is a way to optimise this sequential connections calls?

PEM on it's own isn't a certificate, it's just a way of encoding data. X.509 certificates are one type of data that is commonly encoded using PEM.
PEM is a X.509 certificate (whose structure is defined using ASN.1), encoded using the ASN.1 DER (distinguished encoding rules), then run through Base64 encoding and stuck between plain-text anchor lines (BEGIN CERTIFICATE and END CERTIFICATE).
You can use openssl to make a .pem file which is ANS.1 compliant.
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out ./cert.pem -keyout ./cert.pem

Questions:
If I do have to use the Oauth Web Application, how does the Client Secret in the Oauth Web Application differ from the Public Key Fingerprints in the Oauth Service Account as shown in this image?

","When I run into No such file or directory in... errors, I usually add:

before the include (in your case, in .../modal.php) to see what paths PHP is running/configured with.
More than likely, you need to let PHP know where the libraries directory is.  You can do so by:
set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . '/path/to/libraries');

or update the include_path directive in your php.ini config file.
Also, I see that you start your path with ./.  This means ""in the current directory"".  So, does libraries exist in the same directory as model.php?  If not, then you want the path to just be google-api-php-client/src/Google/Client.php after you add the /path/to/libraries to your include_path.

","The protocol specification must be incorrect. Digital signatures are signed with your private key.
Your certificate needs to accompany the message, and probably be included in the signature. Use the java.security.Signature class in association with your private key, possibly loaded from your KeyStore.
You may need to purchase a signing certificate: an SSL certificate may not be strong enough for bitcoin.
A signature using a public key is completely worthless. Anyone can do it. You sign with your private key. This is legally equivalent to your signature: only you can do it, and anyone can check it by verifying it with your public key, which is why the public key must accompany the signature; and at the same time they can establish whose signature it is, via the certificate which must also accompany the signature.
Or else bitcoin is radically insecure.

FTP  - Not possible over SFTP
SFTP - no host key checking
SFTP - host key checking
SFTP - login and password (LAP)
SFTP - LAP + host key  
I ask because I've seen this Java code:  
config.put(""StrictHostKeyChecking"", ""no"");

And I've read that you can connect to SFTP with and without keys. 
FYI My understanding may be way off.  
","The host key checking indeed contributes to the security of the SSH/SFTP. Though it is in no way related to the authentication (password). So it's not like there are ""levels of security"" that combine these two aspects.
Moreover, your probably confuse the host key checking with the public key authentication.
Read my article on SSH keys to understand the difference between the host key and the key used for authentication.

Host key checking: You should never set the StrictHostKeyChecking to no, unless you connect within a private network, where you do not expect any kind of man-in-the-middle attacks.
Authentication: If possible, use the public key authentications. The password authentication is less secure.

The FTP is in no way related to the SFTP. Anyway, I do not know, what you mean by ""FTP security level"".

I am using the same key that was generated by IPSwitch and have named it as id_rsa in my eclipse. Is the private key generated out of IPSwitch supposed to work for JSch as well?
When I connect via IPSwitch, it works all fine. Could you please help me here?Thanks in advance.
","Thanks to  Martin Prikryl and the community for being with this while I solve this problem. 
It was simple. As Martin mention one of his comment, I just had to generate one more set of keys using another tool like SSH-Keygen and use it instead. I used a software called VANDYKE SecureCRT to generate one more set of keys and it works just fine with JSch. Looks like IPSwitch does something while generating keys which does not seem to work with JSch. It could be that 'Pass' which is available in the config file of IPSwitch, which is specific to IPSwitch. 
Code is as follows,
        JSch jsch = new JSch();
        jsch.addIdentity(privateKeyPath);


        JSch.setLogger(new com.jcraft.jsch.Logger() {
            Path path = Paths.get(""target/jsch.log"");
            @Override
            public boolean isEnabled(int level){
                return true;
            }
            public void log(int level, String message){
                try {
                    StandardOpenOption option =
                       !Files.exists(path) ? StandardOpenOption.CREATE : StandardOpenOption.APPEND;
                    Files.write(path, java.util.Arrays.asList(message), option);
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    System.err.println(message);
                }
            }
        });

        Session session = jsch.getSession(username, host, port);

        session.setConfig(""StrictHostKeyChecking"", ""no"");
        session.setConfig(""PreferredAuthentications"", ""publickey"");
        session.connect();

I would like to encrypt a message one packet at a time, but if the packet grows, it would no longer just be one packet long.
","Here's a simple scheme: Use public / private key encryption to establish a symmetric key. Then do all of your encryption using that symmetric key.
If you also need to ensure message integrity and non-repudiation, then you can run the message through a hash function, which will map it to a fixed length. Then you can sign the hash.
Typically, you wouldn't want to use public keys to encrypt messages anyway. Public / private key pairs are harder to generate and more expensive to use for long encryption, compared to symmetric keys.

First, it's easier. The code is written, tested, reviewed, and maintained.
Second, it's safer. If you don't understand why messages need to be signed, what else might you be overlooking? Honestly, even TLS (SSL), which has had a lot of scrutiny, had a serious flaw in the renegotiation bug that was recently publicized.

By the way, SSH and SSL compute a message authentication code for every protocol record so that a man-in-the-middle cannot tamper with the message content.

Update: ""non-repudiation"" is the word I was looking for. Still researching...
","Most of the time non-repudiation is achieved with cryptographic time-stamps. A time-stamp is a proof of existence of a document at a given time and is issued by a trustworthy third-party with sign the document hash along with the time at which this document was submitted.
I do not know GPG model very well but there is probably something like a certificate which binds the public key with the key owner identity. You have to time-stamp this certificate. Actually you should also time-stamp a proof that that Bob's key is not revoked. In X.509 this is achieved by time-stamping the current revocation list which proves the ""not revoked"" status the key.
Cryptographic time-stamp are standardized in RFC 3161

There is a central machine which can request other machine where the application installed and the other machines can request the central machine. So the each installation will act as a server as well as client. I want to secure the access using ssh public key cryptography.
For simplicity, let's say server A(manager - which is installed first) and server B have the application installed. 
Let's say when server B installed, server A's public key will be available in server B. 
Also assume server A will make the first request to server B. When doing so,  the server A will get server B's public key during the handshake(by verifying the fingerprint, the key will be saved in server A) and server A will send its public key to server B for authentication. As server B already has the server A's public key, authentication successful?.
When server B wants to request server A, the server A will send its public key during the handshake and it is verified against the server A's public key available in server B. For authentication, server B will send its public key which will be verified against the public key that server A got during the previous request handshake(from server A to server B).
One point to note is, there is no user involved. The application is accessible to all the users of the machine.
My query is, do we need separate keys for handshake and authentication or as I described single key is enough?
Also please let me know the above explained security model will have any issues particularly security related?

","Yes, the authenticity of public keys is a key component of applied cryptography. I can issue a public key that says ""I am the website of your bank, trust me"", but you shouldn't really trust it. Different schemes have been developed to establish authentication of public keys. One approach is the web of trust model in PGP and GnuPG, others are PKI and Kerberos. One of the main difference between these approaches is where you place your trust. I provide a simplified description only, you have to read about them to learn about the exact details (you wouldn't base your security on an extremely short summary, would you?).
In the web of trust there are some people who you trust, and you (ideally) verified their public keys personally. You can trust other public keys if they have been signed by several people bearing your initial trust. Using these trusted individuals you can check more and more keys.
In PKI (Personal Key Infrastructure) you trust several Certificate Authorities (CAs) and accept their public keys. You trust them that they thoroughly check the identity of key holders before signing their public keys. The combination of public key + signature from a CA (and some other data) forms a certificate. The PKI is used in SSL/TLS, it is the underlying infrastructure of the secure web. You use it when you read your mail on a web interface, when you do online banking, etc. If a CA is compromised, then every certificate signed by the CA will be come insecure.
In Kerberos is designed for computer networks and the key server is the single point of trust. It provides mutual authentication and a unique symmetric encryption key for clients and servers. The key server checks the identity of clients by a secret shared only between the key server and the client. Kereberos is used, for example, in Windows, AFS, Grid computing.

There's no way to verify this certificate except by checking it against itself; instead, these top-level certificates are manually stored by web browsers.

but passing down my PUBLIC KEY rather than the PRIVATE KEY. At this point, I am getting an error ""Key does not exist"".
I'm presuming this is the case because the PRIVATE KEY contains the relevant key information for the PUBLIC KEY so it can decode this one-way.
How can I sign a block of text in this way that allows me to distribute a signature with it, that can be decrypted by anybody who knows my PUBLIC KEY?

And here some pictures which shows how public key authority and public key certificate works 


","In the environment you described and illustrated in your question, in order to initiate a encrypted comunication, the Initiator has to encrypt the data with the Responder public key, so when the Responder receives a message, will be able to decrypt it with its private key.
So the authorities described in the diagrams, play the roles of public-key distribution, and trust authority, confirming that users are really who they say they are. This means that by uploading a public key or sign ing a public certificate with these authorities, you are just providing other users/machines a mechanism to comunicate with you in a secure maner.
If you want to cancel that public key/certificate from being available, or in other words, prevent your key/certificate to be available to anyone to initiate a secure comunication with you, is the authority who has control over it, becasue it lies in their database, and this is why, you should ask them to revoke the key or the certificate.

"39260300","Preventing JSON domain spoofing","Here's the scenario. A customer already has an eCommerce site where they are collecting shipping address info and credit card data. However, they sign up with a SaaS service that allows them to easily change their credit card form to also collect fullnames and emails (not credit card info) into a marketing system for other purposes. So, they paste a jQuery snippet into their page from the SaaS service and add some ""data-"" attributes to their form and form field tags so that the SaaS service knows what to intercept and where to what SaaS account to post the data.
Okay, but then a security problem occurs. Let's say we have two separate customers in that SaaS system. One is named Jack and owns jack.com, and his account ID is 100001. The other is Nancy, nancy.com, and 100002. Jack could add the snippet into his form and add some ""data-"" attributes, but then screw up and set his account ID in one of those data- attributes to 100002 instead of 100001. This would mean that Nancy would suddenly see Jack's data in her account. Not good! The fix, of course, is to have some setting in Jack's SaaS account so that he only accepts data from jack.com, and Nancy only accepts data from nancy.com.
But then a potential exploit happens. All a hacker has to do is create a spoof page on his own server where he forms similar JSON and, via a /etc/hosts file change on his workstation, makes it appear that he's jack.com. He could then fire in thousands upon thousands of bogus marketing form information into Jack's account because the SaaS service thinks it's coming from jack.com.
Is there anything I can do in the jQuery code, or the PHP code used by the SaaS service, to ensure that a hacker can't spoof like that and that only Jack's real customer data gets sent?
ANSWERED QUESTIONS
Q1. ""How do you identify Jack and Nancy? By domain?""
A1. Jack has his domain jack.com. Nancy has her domain nancy.com. Each use this marketing SaaS service, but each are also co-opting an eCommerce form they already had before they signed up for the SaaS service. They were told in the SaaS docs, ""Just drop the scraper.js in your form page and add these data- tags to your form tag and html input, textarea, and select tags so that the scraper.js can intercept those form submits temporarily, glean the marketing data (full name and email, let's say) from that form, and then let that form submit on its workflow that you already had. The data- attributes would identify which account is to be used, as well as which marketing campaign and sub-campaign where this data should be stored at the SaaS service."" However, in the jQuery of scraper.js, it was going to pass in the JSON the location.href property so that it knows what domain was used -- jack.com or nancy.com, in this particular instance. Trouble is -- the location.href can be spoofed by a hacker who sets up an /etc/hosts file entry of 127.0.0.1 for jack.com on his workstation and runs a copy of the same JSON code.
Q2. ""What if you could use a callback mechanism from SaaS.com to jack.com? So, one of your data- attributes would specify the callback function to receive data back from SaaS.com, and then only save data when it gets the right response?""
A2. Now that's an interesting take. Yeah, so I could like drop an extra PHP page on jack.com that emits ""OK"". When SaaS.com receives a JSON data post from jack.com, it sends a request to that second PHP callback page on jack.com with file_get_contents() to ensure it not only gets the OK response back, but also gets a match on IP address and SSL certificate data. If the two are different, then most likely the request was a bogus hacker request and the transaction can be security logged and rejected. (I can do the IP address verification easily, but am not certain how to verify the same two SSL certificates in PHP, if that's even allowed or possible.) Of course, IP addresses can be spoofed.
Another layer of security on this is that this second PHP page can use a public/private key exchange communication check between SaaS.com and jack.com instead of simply emitting ""OK"".
Q3. ""Why would you want to intercept payment information and send that off through Javascript?""
A3. Absolutely not. Never specified sending payment information in this question. Was saying something like Full Name and Email, instead. Yes, SSL communication would need to be used as well in order to send that data securely. And, we'd have to use JSONP to get around the CORS problem.
Q4. ""Wouldn't that require jack.com to have everything saved in a database for verification? If so, why bother with the SaaS app?""
A4. Nope. Not at all. Check out the answer A2. With that mechanism, the SaaS app receives the data, but doesn't trust it until 2 things happen:

It calls back to jack.com to a second page, and ensures that the response it gets back has the same IP address as the one that sent the form data in the first place.
It does a public/private key exchange check (which the hacker can't spoof obviously unless they have server access) in that second page to ensure that IP spoofing wasn't occurring.

Q5. Wait a minute. A2 and A4 have a problem. The IP address of the initial sending request will be from the user's workstation, not the server. So, you can't validate IP that way. You'll have to use another mechanism to validate that someone completed the form at jack.com and that it wasn't from a hacker spoofing jack.com.
A5. You're absolutely right. Forgot about that I guess because I'm slightly distracted on another project. I'll have to give this some more thought.
","TL;DR: If you're using a purely client-side integration (just javascript), there's no way to completely secure the request.
Accidentally/intentionally sending data to the wrong client
You can mitigate this by using non-sequential, random UUIDs as account IDs.  For example, if an account ID looks like 100001, then someone might try using the account ID 100002; however, if the account ID looks like c3f80e491d44cd91664a0459a0777ed01, it's statistically unlikely that someone will be able to send data to an unknown account.
Intentional spam/fictional submissions
This is a problem with any form that stores data on the internet; I'm not aware of any way around this without help from some server side code.
You can generate a one-time token to be included with the json payload - this can be something like a dated JWT token secured via HMAC, or a set message encrypted with a shared secret key which would then be de-duped by the SAAS server.
If you're going to start involve server-side programming, then this additional negotiation process becomes a bit irrelevant - it's far easier to the just give the e-commerce site an API key, and let them post the customer information over when they receive an order.

However I am not sure if it returns anything sensible. Maybe worth raising a bug in OTP with the code that you posted in this question as steps to reproduce. Then at least someone competent would verify why it doesn't work. I am sure the steps you followed are fine and the types returned and passed to further functions are OK as far as the documentation is concerned.

"6839331","What difference does key length make when signing a file?","I've never taken any classes on encryption or security and I'm trying to teach myself some basics, so forgive me if this is a silly question (don't worry, I'm not working on anything sensitive)
So, I'm playing around with Crypto++ so that I can make a signature of a file to see if the file has been edited by someone other than me. The test application that comes with the library looks like it has options (rs and rv) that do exactly what I want to do in my own program (verify the integrity of the signature of a file). Of course, before doing that I need to generate a public and private key. When doing so with the test application's g option it asks me to specify the key length in bits. What difference does the key length make?
","The key length determines how hard it is for someone to break your cryptography. For digital signatures, that means how hard is it for someone to generate a fake signature.
For RSA a key length of 1024 bits is sufficient for non-sensitive information, but it should only be used for a few years and then replaced with a new key. 2048 bits is stronger and 4096 is stronger still.
For a naive brute-force attacker, adding a single bit to the key length doubles the amount of work they need to do to compromise your key. However, algorithms like RSA do not scale in this way: a 2048-bit RSA key is not 2^1024 times as hard to break as a 1024-bit key (unless the attacker is really stupid).
Generally public key algorithms (e.g. RSA) need much larger keys than symmetric key algorithms (e.g. AES) because they rely on different mathematical properties.
For a good primer on cryptography you should check out Peter Gutmann's godzilla crypto tutorial. It's pretty readable and gives you a good overview of how crypto works in its various forms.

Don't rely on a developer's private repo for deployment. Any code owned by the company needs to be in a repository that is accessible by several people so that there is not a single point of failure.

","Important distinction: Public key pinning pins the public key, not the certificate. The certificate contains the public key, but also contains a signature of the public key (and associated metadata) from a certificate authority.
How I use HPKP:

Generate 3 key pairs.
Upload one to the server, use for HTTPS.
Include the SHA256 hash of all three public keys in the HPKP header.

That gives me two backups. I keep them both on encrypted storage; one is kept on my person, the other in a safe.
Other people pin to intermediate certificates from multiple certificate authorities.
Also, a max-age of two months is adequate. Attackers also have certificate transparency (and the SSL Observatory for users with the HTTPS Everywhere extension) to contend with.

It's based on a secret/private key pair, where both the client and the server know the secret key, but it's obviously never passed along the wire.
Any feedback, insights or holes in this method would be greatly appreciated.

Step 1:

The client wants to make a request to the API, so asks for a nonce from the server - passing their public key.

Step 2:

The server lookups the users private key (using the provided public key) and hashes it (sha256) with a random 32 character string (the nonce).
The hashed nonce and public key are then stored to a local array.
The server then responds to the client with the un-hashed version of the nonce.

Step 3:

The client takes the nonce from the response and also hashes it with it's private key (which the client has locally).
It then makes a request to the server (along with the API task it wants to perform) and sends its version of the hashed nonce and public key. 

Step 4:

The server takes the clients public key and hashed nonce, then checks the local array to see if the public key/nonce pair exist.
If the pair exist; authentication is passed, the request is allowed and the public key/nonce pair is removed from the local array.
","Let me start by saying I don't have any credentials in the security world. Please take everything I say with a grain of salt.
A couple of general thoughts
It seems like you want to roll your own which is a bad idea in any security-related area. Even more so when there are several alternatives in the wild that have been battle-tested.
Off the top of my head, I can name three ways for API authentication that are in wide use:

Basic authentication. Github provides this as a fall-back: “intended to be used for scripts or testing (i.e., cases where full OAuth would be overkill).”
OAuth. Github, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google all use this. This protocol is well-specified but might be overkill for smaller projects. Thanks to widespread client library, it's fairly easy to implement.
Hash-based message authentication code (HMAC). All Amazon Webservices use this. This might be the most under-appreciated solution since it's conceptually easier than OAuth: The client uses its private key to sign requests and send the signature + public key in the request. The server looks up the private key using the public key sent by the client and in turn creates a signature of the request. If the signatures match, the request is valid. Public and private keys have to be exchanged beforehand (AWS lets you download the private key once).

From what you describe, HMAC is the closest candidate to what you want.
A couple of thoughts specific to what you suggested

Your algorithm requires you to keep state on the server (cue “local array”). This is fine for a single server, but what do you do when you scale? When step #2 hits one server and step #3 another, the state has to be shared. You can of course use a shared DB (or cache) or whatever, but you have to think about this.
Roundtrips. Requiring a 2-step authentication like you suggested, every client has to either send an additional request (to get the nonce) for each (payload) request or you have think about when to invalidate your pairs on the server. HMAC essentially does the same thing without request overhead.
Possible attack: I can flood your servers with client requests for nonces. Depending on your public key length, I might come up with valid public keys and I can tie up resources that are never used for the second request. Depending on how you handle that (see also point #1), I might bring your server down.

"55341115","How to generate RSA public key from private key?","I was reading a question on SO and find out that we can generate the public key from private key using openssl in python. Now I wonder how this works(the mathematics part) and  how can I implement the method in python or in C, without using the openssl or any other library ?
","If the private key is stored in CRT format (Chinese Remainder Theorem), there is no math involved; the format includes the public exponent. This is how OpenSSL tools ""create"" a public key from a private key.
If the private is not stored in CRT format, it's generally not feasible to compute the public exponent given the private exponent. You can, however, guess common public exponents and easily verify your guess.
Mathematically, in order to quickly compute one exponent using the other, you need to know the totient, a number computed from the factors of the modulus. And of course the security of RSA is predicated on the infeasibility of factoring the modulus. This relationship is symmetrical; it doesn't matter whether you know the public exponent and try to compute the private exponent, or vice-versa.

"54390330","RSA key signing and verifying in Java(Android)","I am having a slight problem with understanding the concept of RSA signing and verifying.
The problem is that I can create key pair (public and private key) which is perfectly fine.
        KeyPairGenerator keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"");
        random = SecureRandom.getInstance(""SHA1PRNG"");
        keyGen.initialize(2048, random);
        KeyPair pair = keyGen.generateKeyPair();
        myPrivateKey = pair.getPrivate();
        myPublicKey = pair.getPublic();

Signing and verifying are as follows:
        //Singing with private key
        Signature s = Signature.getInstance(""SHA1withRSA"");
        s.initSign(javaPrivateKey);

        //Verifying with public key
        Signature s = Signature.getInstance(""SHA1withRSA"");
        s.initVerify(javaPublicKey);

When I print myPrivateKey and myPublicKey, I see modulus(n) and public exponent(e) are the same for public and private key.
I have converted public and private keys to base64 and hex and I get the different values which is perfectly fine. However, I cannot sign the message with base64 or hex. I can sign it only with what I get from this: 
         myPrivateKey = pair.getPrivate();  

I am aware of that verifying needs to be done with the public key which is visible to everyone. When the message is verified by the receiver, does the receiver use modulus and exponent only? What part of the public key needs to be shared by the sender? Modulus and exponent or Base64 or hex value of the key?
","Yes, the receiver uses modulus and exponent only; there are no other components that are required mathematically speaking to verify a signature for RSA.
The mathematical operations are performed using large numbers (BigInteger values commonly when RSA is implemented in software). To perform any kind of calculation the implementation must regenerate these numbers. How these numbers are transmitted doesn't matter to the algorithm.
Commonly RSA public keys are encoded using something based on PKCS#1, which specifies the public key format using ASN.1 (which defines the structure) and BER/DER (which defines the encoding of that structure). Of course, different protocols may use different encodings of public keys. PGP for instance uses an entirely different ""package format"" to encode keys.

Java however returns a SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure which is defines in the X.509 (certificate and CRL) specifications; besides the modulus and exponent is also contains an algorithm identifier to show that it is an RSA public key. So this structure can also be used to distribute other kind of key values. It can be retrieved by calling getEncoded() on the RSAPublicKey instance - assuming that this instance is compatible with the Oracle provided one - they generally are. Android's implementations certainly should be compatible with this structure. Note that the SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure contains the PKCS#1 public key structure inside of it.
To reverse you need an KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"") and derive the key using X509EncodedKeySpec, initialized with the given byte array.

If you need textual strings instead of binary then you can convert the bytes returned by getEncoded() into base 64 and hexadecimals. Of course, in that case, you need to reverse the encoding (i.e. decode) the result before being able to decode the bytes themselves.
It is also possible to encode the modulus and public exponent yourself. You can retrieve them using RSAPublicKey.getModulus() and RSAPublicKey.getPublicExponent(). To reverse them back into an RSAPublicKey you can use KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"") and RSAPublicKeySpec. That way you can for instance just create a string ""(<modulus>, <exp>)"" and use that to distribute the key. Generally you would want to keep to predefined standards though.

Not covered in this answer is the fact that to verify with a public key you first need to establish trust in the public key. If you cannot trust the public key then you don't know who created the public key. In that case you can also not trust the result of your verification operation; the signature may have been created with a key pair of an adversary. Delving into Public Key Infrastructures (PKI / PKIX) is a bit too much for this answer though.
Likewise: SHA-1 is not considered secure anymore, especially for signature generation / verification. You would want to use at least SHA256withRSA or - slightly more advanced and somewhat more secure - an RSA scheme that uses PSS. 2048 bits is ever so slightly too small for comfort; using a 4096 bit key is advisable if your scheme allows it.

Are there any simple to use ssh libs which allow a program to connect to a remote host and check if a file contains something?
Or should I use the system() function to run ssh and simple commands on the remote host.
It should be secure, so probably I need to use public keys. Is it possible to use the same public key from different computers (each with my program)?

What I need is to check if the computer with the given MAC address (or other identifier) is allowed to do something. And this operation should be remote, so I could remotely enable/disable functionality.
","1) I don't know if it's simple, but there is http://www.libssh.org/ from, IIRC, the same folks who do cURL
2) Yes, you should probably do this via the ""system function"" of a shell script (or system/popen, if you absolutely need to have the results inside a C program), as that will save you a great deal of trouble reimplementing things.
3) Public keys, yes; and while it's possible to reuse public keys on multiple hosts/users, it's not good security practice; better would be generating a keypair for each user/host and then adding the public key to .ssh/authorized_keys on the machine you need to connect to. This means that revoking keys is simply removing a line in a single text file instead of regenerating a key for multiple hosts. However, if it's not security-sensitive, or if security just plain doesn't matter in this instance(!), then using a single key may not be too insane. That is, if you need multiple clients to check for existence on a single host; if not, please update your question to be clearer in this regard.

This requires a public key exchange between the two parties. 
The public key shared by the client is 1024 bit hexadecimal string, which should be used to calculate the shared secret key. How to convert this string into an encoded key format (ASN.1 SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure) to create a PublicKey object.
Considering a sample public key string. Parameters p and g are fed into inputDHParameterSpec object.

The next thing I want to do is to make my application secure by encrypting my messages with asymmetric encryption. To learn about encryption in Python I have made a couple of python scripts using pycrypto. 
The thing I cant quite figure out is how I can or should distribute the keys. In a messaging application with several untracked users which connects and disconnects all the time, how do I generate both public and private keys so that I can successfully implement a asymmetric encryption such as RSA? And how can I make this work using python?
I am fairly new to pycrypto and encryption in general so any suggestions or corrections are greatly appreciated!

I want to use a public key to connect to my git repository and I keep getting
Permission denied (publickey).

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

when ever I try to run any type of git command, fetch, pull, clone...
I setup a .ssh public key in /var/www/.ssh/id_rsa.pub, using  
sudo ssh-keygen

I added the key to BitBucket but no matter what I try I am getting errors.
Any suggestions?
P.S. the owner and group assigned to /var/www/.ssh is apache:apache with 
0700 permissions on the folder and all files under => /var/www/.ssh/
Also, I do have a private key located in /var/www/.ssh/id_rsa, and My /var/www/.ssh/config file looks like this:
Host bitbucket.org
 IdentityFile /var/www/.ssh/id_rsa

","It is the public key that should go to BitBucket, while the private key should most likely go to the default location ~/.ssh/id_rsa.
Mind that if you overwrite whatever existing private key is there, you will lose access to those systems you had originally access to. Better to generate or provide the matching public key to whatever private key is already located at ~/.ssh/id_rsa.
If you do want to store a custom private key separate from it's default location, then that will have to be customized in your git settings.
To summarize:

Make sure you have a private key stored at ~/.ssh/id_rsa.
Send the matching public key to BitBucket.
You can store for safekeeping a copy of the public key at ~/.ssh/id_rsa/pub. It will however not be used.
Make sure that privileges are set right for the following directories:


Your home directory (~)
The ~/.ssh directory
The private key - ~/.ssh/id_rsa.
and several other important files under ~/.ssh.


You can use following script to get privileges fixed if it is broken:
chmod go-w ~
[[ ! -d ~/.ssh ]] && mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh

[[ -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa ]] && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
[[ -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ]] && chmod 640 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
[[ -f ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ]] && chmod 640 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

chown ${USER}: ~
chown -R ${USER}: ~/.ssh

This should in most cases fix privilege related issues, as ssh will refuse to work if not setup right. If you have it any other way, you leave your system potentially vulnerable to an attack, and even if ssh doesn't work yet, your private key could get corrupted by an attack, or stolen.
Make sure the sample script did not get modified from it's original version (no stackoverflow edits by others), unless it was properly documented as to why the edit happened.

I generated the Public/Private-Key pair in another Application (node.js-Backend).
The Problem I think is, that the Modulus may be incorrect. I saved the Public-Key as a PEM-File and converted it to an XML. (Used an Online-Service for this) This XML-File works perfeclty fine with an C#-Test-Application. I then converted the Base64 Modulus- and Exponent-Strings into HEX-Values and added them as constants to my Delphi-App.

"50336118","Why bitcoin address instead of public key?","In asymmetric encryption it is quite common to publish your public key to others. With the public key everyone can verify signatures created with the according private key.
So why do crypto-currencies like bitcoin not simply use the public key as the output of a transaction directly?
Bitcoin is instead using a so called address. What is the reason instead of just using the curve25519 public key?
","There are basically two advantages to publishing an address, i.e., a RIPEMD-160 hash of the public key, instead of the public key directly:

The hash is only 160 bits compared to 256 bits of public key, so we safe about 1/3 of the space that we'd use when directly using public keys. This is both data transferred and stored at the endpoints. While the transferred size is pretty clear, storage comes in two forms as well: UTXO set size and on disk size.
Some limited protection against ECDSA being broken: should it become computationally feasible to create a signature given a public key, because of a weakness being discovered, we can avoid all funds being stolen by having this level of indirection. Assuming that it takes a while to generate a valid signature we can switch the signature algorithm, and the owners in possession of the private key still have a timing advantage w.r.t. an attacker, which would have to grab the public key from the wire, turn around and quickly compute a signature to a competing transaction.

Two Questions:
How can I translate the above code into Python? The code below failed.
Once I have the public key object in python, how can I use it to verify a JWT signed by the corresponding private key? Please post a snippet showing exactly how it can be done.
>>> from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
>>> import base64
>>> public_key = RSA.construct((base64.b64decode(jwk['n']), base64.b64decode(jwk['e'])))

  File ""my-virtual-env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Crypto/PublicKey/_slowmath.py"", line 84, in rsa_construct
    assert isinstance(n, long)
AssertionError

","The error is raised because the RSA contructor is expecting 2 long integers and you are using two strings.
The solution is to convert the base64 decoded string into an hexadecimal integer. 
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
import base64

n = int(base64.b64decode(jwk['n']).encode('hex'),16)
e = int(base64.b64decode(jwk['e']).encode('hex'),16)
e = long(e)

public_key = RSA.construct((n, e))
print(public_key)

Regarding the second question maybe you can use this method to verify the validity of an RSA signature.

"31596663","How is the process of signing and verifying a release and why apache says that the signature file signed by a public key?","I have started learning GPG and I am a bit confused about the infos I have found. The GnuPG documentation says that

A signature is created using the private key of the signer

But at the Apache's site, they say:

The signature file is a digest of the original file signed by a public key...

And on the same site, in another section, they say the following:

A digital signature is created from an original document using a private key.

Now I suppose that the process of signing involves signing the hash of a release using the private key of the holder and not the public one like Apache says in the second link I have posted, or am I wrong? Otherwise, how could someone be ever able to decrypt the hash of a release signed with a public key if he/she doesn't have the private key of the holder? 
Then, could someone simply explain in what the processes of signing and verifying a signature consist and what are the passages, e.g. for a software release like Apache Maven?
","TL;DR: There is a mistake in the documentation, your understanding of signatures is right.

The signature file is a digest of the original file signed by a public [sic, this is should be private] key...

Signing a document usually is performed by calculating the hash sum of the document (asymmetric cryptography is very slow for large amounts of data), which finally is encrypted using the private key, so anybody can decrypt it using the public key. If the decryption process results in the same hash sum as is calculated from the original document, it must have been encrypted using the private key - which is only known to the signer; thus the authorship is verified.
Encryption (leaving apart the aspect of hybrid cryptosystems like OpenPGP is, but the general concept stays the same) works the other way round; the public key is used for encryption, so only the private key can be used to decrypt the information.
I added a bug report for the documentation issue (closed/fixed since 2015-07-29).

Then, could someone simply explain in what the processes of signing and verifying a signature consist and what are the passages?, e.g. for a software release like Apache Maven -> https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi?Preferred=ftp://apache.mirrors.tds.net/pub/apache.org/ ?


You need to fetch the public key used for signing the software (usually, you will download it from a keyserver using gpg --recv-key [key-id].
Verify the key's integrity, for example by speaking with the developers, your web of trust, the products HTTPs-encrypted website (depending on how paranoid you're at verifying the authorship).
Issue a signature to certify the key if it is not already verified through your web of trust, if you don't want to create a public one, there are also local signatures which are never transmitted to the key server network.
Finally, use gpg --verify to check that the signature was indeed issued by the product maintainer's key.

","What you initially refer to is symmetric encryption (shared key), which allows 2 entities to communicate securely based on a single shared key that is only known to the two entities.  This key can be exchanged several ways, but can't be publicized for obvious reasons.
Asymmetric encryption (public/private key) allows 2 entities to communicate securely as follows:
If one party wants to accept secure (encrypted) information, they need a key that isn't visible to the world (private), but they also have to be able to provide a key to anyone who wants to send encrypted information (public).
So I can give my public key out to the whole world and know the data is secure since only I have the private key, therefore I'm the only one who can decrypt it.

"33479597","Private and public key separately","οκ!I want to establish a client server communication oves SSL/TLS in java. The server is multithreaded. With openssl I acted as my own CA (created private key and self-signed certificate for the authority). Now I want to create keys and certs for my server and clients which are signed from the CA I created.
1)Do I have to create certs and keys from the prompt for every single client? Or is it another ""automated"" way eg with a script?
2) I have seen that this code for setting up keystores
private void setupClientKeyStore() throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException 
    {
    clientKeyStore = KeyStore.getInstance( ""JKS"" );
    clientKeyStore.load( new FileInputStream( ""client1publickey.jks"" ),
                       ""password"".toCharArray() );
    }

    private void setupServerKeystore() throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException
    {
    InputStream keyStoreResource = new FileInputStream(""serverprivatekey.jks"");
    char[] keyStorePassphrase = ""password"".toCharArray();
    serverKeyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS"");
    serverKeyStore.load(keyStoreResource, keyStorePassphrase);
}

I have run the command to see what type of entries are these and client1publickey is a TrustedCert entry while serverprivatekey is a PrivateKey entry. This code is on my server class. I have this code on my client class  private void setupServerKeystore() throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException {
    serverKeyStore = KeyStore.getInstance( ""JKS"" );
    serverKeyStore.load( new FileInputStream(""serverpublickwy.jks""), 
                        ""university"".toCharArray() );
  } 
   private void setupClientKeyStore() throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException {
    clientKeyStore = KeyStore.getInstance( ""JKS"" );
    clientKeyStore.load( new FileInputStream( ""client1privatekey.jks"" ),
                       ""university"".toCharArray() );}
The question is that how can I create these jks files separately? The publickey.jks file is cert, right? How can I have it in another file from the private key and be signed from CA? Or is it another way I can estabvlish connections between client/server? 
Firstly I had created the CA with openssl and then the two jks files for server and client included the certs and the key. Sorry for the english.

The messages are encrypted with public keys that are previously communicated.  My question is, in a react type app environment (or more generic web app environment) what is the best practices in working with public/private keys?  I don't really want to store keys on behalf of the user, or is this something that is done by web apps?  Do I ask them to submit the private key every time there is data to be decrypted?

"56062594","OpenSSL ECDH setting peer's public key in C","I'm trying to integrate ECDH using OpenSSL in my C-SDK (which we will refer to as client) which is running on Ubuntu and needed some help regarding how to set the peer's (server) public key on the client side and eventually generating the shared secret.
Some details:

I am successfully generating a public key and can also generate a shared secret on the server side which has an embedded microcontroller using the mbedTLS library.
The public key I receive from the server is in the form of a uint8_t array of size 32 bytes.
I now want to use OpenSSL's ECDH to generate the public key for server and the shared secret on the client side.

I found a sample code on the OpenSSL wiki website which is as below:
#include <openssl/evp.h>
#include <openssl/ec.h>


unsigned char *ecdh(size_t *secret_len)
{
    EVP_PKEY_CTX *pctx, *kctx;
    EVP_PKEY_CTX *ctx;
    unsigned char *secret;
    EVP_PKEY *pkey = NULL, *peerkey, *params = NULL;
    /* NB: assumes pkey, peerkey have been already set up */

    /* Create the context for parameter generation */
    if(NULL == (pctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_id(EVP_PKEY_EC, NULL))) handleErrors();

    /* Initialise the parameter generation */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_paramgen_init(pctx)) handleErrors();

    /* We're going to use the ANSI X9.62 Prime 256v1 curve */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_ec_paramgen_curve_nid(pctx, NID_X9_62_prime256v1)) handleErrors();

    /* Create the parameter object params */
    if (!EVP_PKEY_paramgen(pctx, &params)) handleErrors();

    /* Create the context for the key generation */
    if(NULL == (kctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new(params, NULL))) handleErrors();

    /* Generate the key */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_keygen_init(kctx)) handleErrors();
    if (1 != EVP_PKEY_keygen(kctx, &pkey)) handleErrors();

    /* Get the peer's public key, and provide the peer with our public key -
     * how this is done will be specific to your circumstances */
    peerkey = get_peerkey(pkey);

    /* Create the context for the shared secret derivation */
    if(NULL == (ctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new(pkey, NULL))) handleErrors();

    /* Initialise */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_derive_init(ctx)) handleErrors();

    /* Provide the peer public key */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_derive_set_peer(ctx, peerkey)) handleErrors();

    /* Determine buffer length for shared secret */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_derive(ctx, NULL, secret_len)) handleErrors();

    /* Create the buffer */
    if(NULL == (secret = OPENSSL_malloc(*secret_len))) handleErrors();

    /* Derive the shared secret */
    if(1 != (EVP_PKEY_derive(ctx, secret, secret_len))) handleErrors();

    EVP_PKEY_CTX_free(ctx);
    EVP_PKEY_free(peerkey);
    EVP_PKEY_free(pkey);
    EVP_PKEY_CTX_free(kctx);
    EVP_PKEY_free(params);
    EVP_PKEY_CTX_free(pctx);

    /* Never use a derived secret directly. Typically it is passed
     * through some hash function to produce a key */
    return secret;
}

The example has a peerkey = get_peerkey(pkey); line where it sets the peerkey and basically leaves it on the user to implement this function. I would imagine it would be straightforward if I was using OpenSSL on the server side as well.
My question:
Referring to the above code,and keeping in mind that I'm receiving the server's public key as a uint8_t array, how do I set the EVP_PKEY *peerkey context so that it contains the server's public key?
If there's another straight-forward crypto library in C that I can use on Ubuntu then please do suggest!
Really appreciate any help.
Thank you!

So, every client that connects to this server provides an SSL certificate and I want to reject connections from clients who have a public key size less than 2048 bits. There seems to be no straightforward way to do this yet. 
I was able to do it using a ServerInterceptor this way
public class SSLInterceptor implements ServerInterceptor {

    }
}

This is a bad way to do it because

The validation is being done after the connection is already
established.
The validation is only triggered when a request/call is made.
Every single call involves an extra overhead of validation.
In case of a validation failure, only the call is rejected but not the connection to the client.

In an ideal scenario

The validation is done during the connection establishment phase. (or some point during the creation of the channel between client and server)
The validation failure would prevent the connection from being created and not set it up and disconnect later.
A client is only validated once per session and all the calls made during that session do not incur any overhead.

How can I do this better?
","You can customize certificate checking by providing your own javax.net.ssl.TrustManagerFactory to Netty's SslContextBuilder. You'd probably want to implement X509ExtendedTrustManager, do your check, and then delegate to a ""real"" implementation for the rest of the cert chain checking.
You can do something like this to get the default-configuration TrustManagerFactory:
TrustManagerFactory tmf = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(
    TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
tmf.init((KeyStore) null);
// loop through tmf.getTrustManagers() checking for one implementing X509TrustManager

","The following may help if gRPC allows you to get at the SSLEngine:
I made a mock-up using SSLEngineSimpleDemo (which is part of Oracle jssesamples.zip) to set custom AlgorithmConstraints where it creates the SSLEngine:
private void createSSLEngines() throws Exception {
    ...
    serverEngine = sslc.createSSLEngine();
    ...
    // Set custom AlgorithmConstraints on the SSL engine
    SSLParameters sslParams = sslc.getSupportedSSLParameters();
    sslParams.setAlgorithmConstraints( new MyAlgorithmConstraints() );
    serverEngine.setSSLParameters(sslParams);

The class MyAlgorithmConstraints looks something like:
import java.security.AlgorithmConstraints;
import java.security.AlgorithmParameters;
import java.security.CryptoPrimitive;
import java.security.Key;
import java.security.interfaces.RSAKey;
import java.util.Set;

public class MyAlgorithmConstraints implements AlgorithmConstraints {


    @Override
    public boolean permits(Set<CryptoPrimitive> primitives, String algorithm, AlgorithmParameters parameters) {
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean permits(Set<CryptoPrimitive> primitives, Key key) {
        boolean permitted = permittedRSAKey(primitives, key);
        return permitted;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean permits(Set<CryptoPrimitive> primitives, String algorithm, Key key, AlgorithmParameters parameters) {
        boolean permitted = permittedRSAKey(primitives, key);
        return permitted;
    }

    private boolean permittedRSAKey(Set<CryptoPrimitive> primitives, Key key) {
        boolean permitted = true;
        if (primitives.contains(CryptoPrimitive.KEY_AGREEMENT) && key instanceof RSAKey) {
            int length = ((RSAKey)key).getModulus().bitLength();
            if (length < 2040) {
                permitted = false;
                System.out.println(""+*+*+* MyConstraints: short RSA key not allowed [""+length+""]"");
            }
        }
        return permitted;
    }

}

Length 2040 chosen in case of leading zeroes on the key as per warning in How to get the size of a RSA key in Java but you could just as well reverse the condition to length > 1024 permitted=true.

","Assuming that your first byte is not sending the size of key byte array or you are using the key that has size bigger than 256-bit, then the array will be incomplete. 
Try using DataOutputStream methods of writeLong() or writeInt() to send byte size to initiate the right size array. Secondly try using buffers to read when its being send. 
Here is little bit of my code from my file socket sender:
This is sending part:
    OutputStream os = sock.getOutputStream();
    DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(os);     
    dos.writeInt(mybytearray.length);

This is recieving part:
InputStream in = sock.getInputStream();
DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(in);
int byteSize = clientData.readInt();
byte[] byteData = new Byte[byteSize];
dis.read(byteData);

You may want to buffer receiving part by telling how many bytes to read using method of DIS read(byte[],int,int) until all of the bytes were read. I tested my code on same machine with very small size data so the connection stability was not a factor.

Lost bytes in input stream

Unread bytes in input stream. You assumed that read() filled the buffer. It isn't obliged to do that. Use DataInputStream.readFully(). 
You're also limiting yourself to 128 key bytes by using write(int), and read() with no parameters, for sending/receiving the length word. Use DataOutputStream.writeInt() and DataInputStream.readInt() for that.

I tired to follow https://www.mobilefish.com/services/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency.html#refProdedure and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_point_multiplication Could you help me recognize where I did a mistake?

Currently the expression

y.modInverse(x).mod(p)

This is wrong and causes the observed error message. The following applies:

which must be coded as follows: 
y.multiply(x.modInverse(p)).mod(p)

In the add method, the case: 

is not handled. Here, the add method must return zero (i.e. the point representing the point at infinity). Geometrically, this case corresponds to a vertical secant (2 intersections).
Analogously, the case

is not handled in the doublePoint method. Here, the doublePoint method must return zero as well. Geometrically, this case corresponds to a vertical tangent (1 intersection).
The mult method doesn't work. But with regard to the comment in the code this is probably known.
Testing is easier if a small prime finite field is used. Here you can specify elliptical curves and determine the corresponding points. Note, that a curve with b != 0 must be used, otherwise the point (0,0) is a regular point of the curve and could not be used as a representative of the point at infinity.

When I extract it, it's always not 1024 bits, but more. Has that something to do with padding or...? Looks like 136 bytes at the moment, so 64 bit too much. Not sure whether this is a constant or depends on the certificate
edit:
I retried with openssl x509 -modulus -inform PER -in file.cer and it resulted in 128 bytes. Guess that's it.
edit2:
So, this still is my problem. I did openssl x509 -inform DER -in file.cer -text and got a modulus of 129 bytes. Is my assumption correct that I can skip the first one because it is 0x00 which might just be used to make the whole thing positive again (first byte otherwise would be a 0xaa which might be negative)?

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, are there any security settings I might need to change to prevent it from locking out domain accounts?
","I checked the .net source code and found what causes an authentication problem in X509Certificate2.PublicKey. It is a creation of a new OID object:
public PublicKey PublicKey {
    [SecuritySafeCritical]
    get {
        if (m_safeCertContext.IsInvalid)
            throw new CryptographicException(SR.GetString(SR.Cryptography_InvalidHandle), ""m_safeCertContext"");

        if (m_publicKey == null) {
            string friendlyName = this.GetKeyAlgorithm();
            byte[] parameters = this.GetKeyAlgorithmParameters();
            byte[] keyValue = this.GetPublicKey();
            Oid oid = new Oid(friendlyName, OidGroup.PublicKeyAlgorithm, true); // this line
            m_publicKey = new PublicKey(oid, new AsnEncodedData(oid, parameters), new AsnEncodedData(oid, keyValue));
        }

        return m_publicKey;
    }
}

The OID constructor is called with lookupFriendlyName set to 'true', which leads to FindOidInfoWithFallback function:
// Try to find OID info within a specific group, and if that doesn't work fall back to all
// groups for compatibility with previous frameworks
internal static string FindOidInfoWithFallback(uint key, string value, OidGroup group)
{
    string info = FindOidInfo(key, value, group);

    // If we couldn't find it in the requested group, then try again in all groups
    if (info == null && group != OidGroup.All)
    {
        info = FindOidInfo(key, value, OidGroup.All);
    }

    return info;
}

The first FindOidInfo returns null and then it is called second time with OidGroup.All. Eventually it results in cryptAPI call:
CAPIMethods.CryptFindOIDInfo(dwKeyType, pvKey, dwGroupId);

From documentation:

The CryptFindOIDInfo function performs a lookup in the active
  directory to retrieve the friendly names of OIDs under the following
  conditions:

The key type in the dwKeyType parameter is set to    CRYPT_OID_INFO_OID_KEY or CRYPT_OID_INFO_NAME_KEY.
No group identifier is specified in the dwGroupId parameter or the GroupID    refers to EKU OIDs, policy OIDs or template OIDs.


It then attempts to authentication with local user account and as a result I'm getting my domain account locked. From the comments to the code I see that the second FindOidInfo call was added for compatibility with older frameworks and potentially I can remove it. Unfortunately there is no easy was to change the code since it is in the framework itself. I may try to inherit the X509Certificate2 object and rewrite PublicKey and PrivateKey, but I don't really like that idea.

","What you need to understand is the Public Key Infrastructure. This structure consists of 2 keys per ""user"", one public, one private. PKI uses algorithms that can cipher a message using the public key of User1, and only knowing the private key of User1, can this message be deciphered. To use your example, Anyone can encrypt a message with Alice's Public Key, but only Alice can de-crypt it, because  Alice is the only one who has the private key counter-part. 
PKI or asymmetric ciphers, are slower than symmetric cipher, that is why PKI is only used as a precursor of symmetric key ciphers. For more info, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography.

Yes, the message is encrypted with Bob's public key and encrypted with private key. ( Be aware that the size of the message is límited by RSA key size, so for encryption of large message RSA encryption is used to share a symmetric encryption key)

Likewise, in order for Alice to send a message that everyone can verify that it is from her, do we simply send an encrypted message with Alice's public key?

It is not correct. This case if known as 'digital signature'. The message is digested with a hashing algorithm like SHA, and the result is encrypted with Alice's private key. This is the signature. Bob can verify the message and signature with Alice's public key (decrypt the signature and check that the hash of the message is the same that the encrypted one). If verification is succesful you know that It has been issued by Alice because she owns the private key

Then my problems start. Now I can't make pushes it's giving me:
this message. I haven't set up keys or did something similar, I just typed command that I mentioned above. I then tried to unset the remote.origin.url property but it's not pushing again, it says this. Now I just want to undo my changes, I will type my username and password every time if necessary but I need to make pushes to my repo.

And that’s the problem with blindly following suggestions in answers to completely different questions :)
You basically told Git now to connect and authenticate via SSH but didn’t give it a single information on how that actually works. SSH uses a a private/public key combination which requires you to generate those first on your machine and upload the public one to GitHub then.
Please see this help document by GitHub on how to set up your SSH keys correctly and how to add the public key to your account.

The attested credential data is made variable because of the credential public key field which is a CBOR map.
In case there are extensions, how to know in advance the byte length of this field, so that I can pass this field truncated without the extensions to a CBOR library?
The CBOR library I am using doesn't seem to handle extra bytes, and I don't know CBOR enough to know if there's a trick to compute the byte length of a map from its first bytes (or any other trick).
","From what I understand there is no way to know in advance without using a CBOR decoder (or COSE Key parser) supporting ""extra bytes"" first, to determine where the ""credential public key data"" ends and where ""extension data"" starts.
There is an extra note discussing exactly this in the Editors Draft (not yet in the Candidate Recommendation).

Determining attested credential data's length, which is variable,
  involves determining credentialPublicKey’s beginning location given
  the preceding credentialId’s length, and then determining the
  credentialPublicKey’s length (see also Section 7 of [RFC8152]).

","Crypto++ uses the PCKS #8 Private Key Information Standard for private keys and the X.509 Public key standard format as specified in their documentation. Puttygen uses the PuTTY format. These are not easily converted using C++, but it is possible. It's a lot easier just to export to OpenSSH format from within puttygen though.
If you still want to do it programmatically, you can use the Chilkat CKSshKey library which was developed for just this purpose. You can see an example of converting a PuTTY private key to OpenSSH PEM (which is what Crypto++ will read) here.

So, what is the problem?

","The latest available version of sodiumoxide on crates.io is currently 0.0.10 which doesn't support serde. You can see this if you look at the Cargo.toml file for the 0.0.10 tag.

serde_json  = ""*""
sodiumoxide = { git = ""https://github.com/dnaq/sodiumoxide"" }

Since you're using the version of sodiumoxide from github, you'll also need to use the github version of its FFI wrapper libsodium-sys. You can do this by adding this to your Cargo.toml:

The RSAPublicKey functions process an RSA public key using an RSA structure. The public key is encoded using a PKCS#1 RSAPublicKey structure.
The RSA_PUBKEY functions also process an RSA public key using an RSA structure. However the public key is encoded using a SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure and an error occurs if the public key is not RSA .

and from RFC 3280,

4.1.2.7  Subject Public Key Info
This field is used to carry the public key and identify the algorithm
    with which the key is used (e.g., RSA, DSA, or Diffie-Hellman).  The
    algorithm is identified using the AlgorithmIdentifier structure
    specified in section 4.1.1.2.  The object identifiers for the

","SSH public key authentication is uses asymmetric encryption.
You have a key pair, where one of the keys is called private (identity) and the other public. What you encrypt with the private key can be decrypted with the public key and vice versa. So the server needs to posses your public key to be able to decrypt the SSH traffic coming from you (the JSch SSH client).

","The entire set of Bitcoin transactions ever performed is actually available online. Any Bitcoin client will, when it first starts up, download the entire transaction log. So that's one way to do it. Just use either a client library, or run a client and parse what it downloads.

a hacker managed to capture amazon's public key

Amazon's public key is public. Everyone knows it. The one that was issued May 3, 2018 begins ""A9 F4 4A 9B 29 84 20 A7 53 FF BA 01 B5 1E 0C 2A A7 53"". The whole point of public/private key cryptography is that the public key is not a secret. So capturing the public key is not important.
Your question isn't about masquerading as Amazon to you (i.e. having to do with Amazon's keys). It's about masquerading as you to Amazon. That's a completely different situation. You don't identify yourself to Amazon with a certificate (called a ""client certificate""), so certificates and public/private key cryptography have nothing to do with this. Yes; anyone could send a message to Amazon encrypted with their public key, but that's not how you prove you are who you say you are.
Instead, you identify yourself to Amazon with credentials, typically a user name and a password. When you do that, Amazon hands you back a session token, which is just a big random number that is mapped to you in a database table (or sometimes the session token is encrypted information about the session so that the database isn't needed). Once you're authenticated, you keep passing your session token back to Amazon to say ""you already know and trust who I am.""
So what if someone captures the session token? That would be a big deal. That would absolutely allow exactly what you're describing. The session token has to be protected for as long as it's valid. We protect it when we pass it to Amazon using TLS which ""prevents sniffers from knowing the content of a message"" so attackers hopefully can't discover the session id.
There are many attacks to steal the session id, broadly called ""session hijacking."" One of the more famous was Firesheep, which relied on unsecured (HTTP) sessions. However, there are more advanced attacks against HTTPS, such as CRIME and BREACH. Improvements in TLS have mitigated against various known attacks, but it is always possible that new ones will emerge.

Very good question.  TLS prevents this by creating sessions keys between the client and server during the handshake protocol.  There are two types of keys: one for encryption (typically AES) and one for message integrity / message authentication (MAC) (typically HMAC).  All comms during the session are encrypted with the symmetric encryption key and MAC'ed with the MAC key.  Any data that is not properly signed with the MAC key is not accepted by the server.  Thus, only one who has these keys can communicate with the server for that session.
So the question then reduces to how an attacker can determine the encryption and MAC keys which are set up during the initial TLS handshake.  Note during the handshake, the server provides its public key via the certificate to the client, and the client verifies that the certificate is valid -- including that it belongs to the domain that is claimed in the certificate.  This allows the client to verify that it is talking to the right server assuming nobody can bypass PKI (i.e. cert authorities are doing the right thing and nobody can break the public key crypto).  Now different clients can set up different sessions with the server, but they all are done using a private key generated by each client and uniquely known by each client.  Therefore, each client sets up its session in a unique way using a key that is known only to them and nobody else.
There is more to the whole design if you want to dig deep, including how sequence numbers are used to prevent replay attacks.  But I hope you get the general idea.

","Never, ever, ever pass arbitrary binary data to the String constructor. You don't have encoded text, you have arbitrary bytes. That's not what the String constructor is for.
Ideally, don't represent the binary data as text at all - but if you have to, do so using base64 or hex, which will encode arbitrary binary data in ASCII.

","The id_rsa.pub file contains the RSA public key for your user (generally the key used for connecting to GitHub, if you follow their tutorial).  If you want to use the github_rsa key, you can change the key used to connect to GitHub by creating a new host definition in the ~/.ssh/config file:
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_rsa

By the way, the known-hosts file contains the servers you have connected to and their public keys.

","The known-host file that you have given in the question has the public ssh-keys of the respective servers.
The private-public key pair are supposed to be for authentication!
Your .ssh folder is supposed to have two keys 1. Private key and 2. Public key. Public key has extension .pub and private key dosen't have any! 
So most probably the two files that you have are one is Public (Which will also be there on github) and private.
Anyhow To know which key your github is using you can do this:

Find the public key in your github account and find its pair in your .ssh folder (i.e if you have maintained a proper nomenclature).
OR else Take your private key and run the command ssh-keygen -y -f <private key file>, it will create a public key. Compare the generated pub-key with your github!

Hope this explains a lot more than the question for your future use! :)

"18459466","How to switch between keys to push to Heroku?","At my work station at the office, I set a new key and push successfully. 
But at home, I forgot my password. So I generated a new key and added it

I set a password that I memorized. But when I went to push to Heroku, rather than being asked for the password respective of the public key I was asked for, I was instead prompted for a password to a different key. 

I also looked at Heroku's documentation on keys but they did not mention how to remove the old keys.
I am also aware of the question Permission denied (publickey) when deploying heroku code. fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly but that does not explain why I am not able to switch between keys. 
Yes I have created a new key and uploaded it
Juan-Gallardos-MacBook-Pro:.ssh juangallardo$ heroku keys:add heroku_sucks.pub
Uploading SSH public key heroku_sucks.pub... done
Juan-Gallardos-MacBook-Pro:.ssh juangallardo$

But stil got 
Cloning into 'cssbuttongallery'...
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

","Since Heroku's documentation was incomplete I found some guidance from Github. Apparently I was not using my SSH Key https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey#make-sure-you-have-a-key-and-ssh-is-using-it . Which I found out by running 
ssh-add -l

I then added it by running
ssh-add ~/.ssh/[name_of_key]

So you just replace ""[name_of_key]"" with your filename (modify the path if you need to). And do not include the .pub extension or you will get an WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE! error.
You will then be prompted for your passphrase
Enter passphrase

And get a confirmation if all goes well

It has to be some small dumb mistake somewhere, but I just can't figure it out. If it helps, when I do ssh-add -l, my fingerprints look like a hash for some reason.
","Do check that:

when you copy the public key in your GitLab settings profile, it is copied as one line
when you generate your RSA SSH key, you use the old legacy profile (in case the new OPENSSH one with 70 chars per line is not well interpreted)

That is
ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -P ""

"52687069","How to save public key in SSL certificate messages using OpenSsl?","I want to save the public key and its algorithm in SSL Certificates messages.
in OpenSSL library, I found a function named public_key_type which returns public key algorithm. but to extract public key, I found just a function named evp_PKEY_print_public, which prints public key. but I don't want to print it. my goal is to save it in a structure.
anyone can help me?
","From your question, it is not entirely clear to me what you mean by ""to save it in a structure"". But I can explain how you can get access to the actual public key stored in your certificate, so you can do what you want with it.
First, you can use the following to get a hold of the certificate's public key, in its generic format:
EVP_PKEY *pubkey = X509_get_pubkey(cert);
/* If it is not NULL, do what needs to be done with pubkey */
EVP_PKEY_free(pubkey);

See the documentation of X509_get_pubkey() for more information.
Now that you have this generic public key, you can use its lower-level key accessors to get access to the underlying public key in its specific format. For example:
RSA *rsapubkey = EVP_PKEY_get1_RSA(pubkey);
if (NULL != rsapubkey) {
    printf(""This cert has an RSA public key\n"");
    /* Do your stuff with the RSA key, for example using RSA_get0_key()
       for current versions of OpenSSL, or directly access the fields
       rsapubkey->n and rsapubkey->e for older versions */
    RSA_free(rsapubkey);

The function EVP_PKEY_get1_RSA() returns NULL if the underlying key is not an RSA key. Otherwise, you can use it to get access to the modulus (n) and exponent (e), which is basically all you need to ""save"" it. Or you can hold on to rsapubkey, since it contains all public key information. You have to RSA_free() it when you are done.
Similarly, you can use EVP_PKEY_get1_EC_KEY() if you expect an EC key.

The messages contain the respective public keys of the clients.
The server has a list of public keys.
If the newly received public key is not present in the list, the server adds it there.
I have done the part of comparing the public keys and writing the public key not present in the list.
Code for multithreaded server (here the server actually listens at two different ports) :
while(!isStopped()){
        System.out.println(""Server is working"");
        try {
                serverSocket = ServerSocketChannel.open();
                serverSocket.configureBlocking(false);
                serverSocket.bind(new InetSocketAddress(serverPortRequest));
                serverSocket.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_ACCEPT);
                serverSocket = ServerSocketChannel.open();
                serverSocket.configureBlocking(false);
                serverSocket.bind(new InetSocketAddress(serverPortAccept));
                serverSocket.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_ACCEPT);

                while(selector.isOpen()){
                    selector.select();
                    Set<SelectionKey> readyKeys = selector.selectedKeys();
                    Iterator<SelectionKey> iterator = readyKeys.iterator();
                    while(iterator.hasNext()){
                        SelectionKey key = (SelectionKey) iterator.next();
                        if(key.isAcceptable()){
                            SocketChannel client = serverSocket.accept();
                            (new Thread(new WorkerRunnable(client,""Multithreaded Server""))).start();
                        }
                    }
                }

        } catch (IOException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
}

The WorkerRunnable thread is where I check if the client's public key is already in the server's list or not :
if(!isPresent(userPK)) {
        FileOutputStream pk;
        try {
            pk = new FileOutputStream(""contactsPK/contact""+Server.pkCounter++);
            pk.write(userPK);
            pk.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

    }

Here userPK is a byte array which stores the public key obtained from the message sent by a client.
How do i check at regular intervals (say 30 seconds) that a client, from the list of clients, has not sent the server a message? I would like to delete that client i.e. its public key from the list of stored public keys of the server.
","That's a really great question!
You're almost there with what you're trying to achieve, you just want to be careful about a couple of gotchas!
You start off your code with:
 while(!isStopped()){
 ...
 }

Which is a way of ensuring that you're consistently listening in on a port, but what you're also doing is creating a mutex lock for that process. You can read up on it here: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion
What that will do is ensure that no other processes have access to the processor while you're running this code. With that,  unfortunately you'll see that as you start to scale your code up and add on functionality, this loop will prevent you from decoupling your code, ensuring robustness, and adding functionality (I'll get back to this later!). First what you'll want to do is use a web framework for your application, this can be done using a plethora of different options. Here are two resources which can help you decide:
http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/the-curious-coders-java-web-frameworks-comparison-spring-mvc-grails-vaadin-gwt-wicket-play-struts-and-jsf/
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_frameworks#Java
I would reccommend starting off with the Spring MVC framework, it's the most generic and widely used these days and you'll have ample resources online to help you get started.
Once you've picked your framework, you're going to want to create an MVC architecture web application, here are a couple of resources:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller
http://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/
Your View isn't going to consist of too much, and in fact it can act as to just pass the public key along to your back-end (your controller and your model).
With the above mentioned, you can get rid of all the code that is looping and waiting to hear a ping from your ports, you can simply specify which ports to listen to in your Spring MVC configuration files. 
Now for the fun part! You asked: 
 ""How do i check at regular intervals (say 30 seconds) that a client, from the list of clients, has not sent the server a message? I would like to delete that client i.e. its public key from the list of stored public keys of the server.""

This can be achieved via two stores in your back end: redis - a session based key store, and a simple relation database of your flavor.
Your Algorithm can go simply as follows:
 1. Every time your view forwards the information of a request to your backend, add it to your redis database, in the form <id, key>

 2. Simply create a thread to run every 30 seconds to do:
     2a. get the list of id's from redis
     2b. perform a left outer join on table a and b, where A is your sql table of ids, and B is the list of ids from redis.  A left outer join returns all the values from an inner join plus all values in the left table that do not match to the right table. Here is a resource for SQL Joins: http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/
     2c. The result of the join is your final answer, be sure to store this in your db.
     2d. purge all keys from redis (this is a one-liner)

You can create a thread to run every 30 seconds on your backend using ScheduledExecutorService as follows:
 ScheduledExecutorService exec = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();
 exec.scheduleAtFixedRate(new Runnable() {
 @Override
 public void run() {
     // 2a from above: (get the list of id's from redis)
     // 2b from above (perform a left outer join on table a and b, where A is your sql table of ids, and B is the list of ids from redis.  A left outer join returns all the values from an inner join plus all values in the left table that do not match to the right table.)
     // 2c from above (The result of the join is your final answer, be sure to store this in your db)
     // 2d from above (purge all keys from redis (this is a one-liner)
}
}, 0, 30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

Since this is a very concrete and repeatable task, you do have a couple of other options which have tradeoffs associated with them. You could create a crontab job which can execute a script which does the above, or even use triggers which are built into many relational databases's capabilities. The main down side to both is that you would be loosing code visibility as you choose to do so.
I also mentioned above about de-coupiling. Coupling (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming) is a very important concept as you begin to write code which scales. You want to keep code as loosely coupled as possible (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling) beacuse it's going to make debugging and make writing in a OOP fashion much easier for you.

To ensure the content has actually been posted by a certain user (and has not been altered after being posted), a signature is created using the private key of the author of the content, whose public key is accessible for everyone on a centralized repository.
Problem is, I have no control over how the content is actually stored on these servers. So I might transmit the content e.g. as a JSON object with all data being base64-encoded and the signature is created using a hash of this the base64-encoded content concatenated in a certain order:
{
    ""a"": ""b"",
    ""c"": ""d"",
    ""signature"": ""xyz""
}

with
signature := sign(PrivKey, hash(b + d);

Now the server will probably store the content of this in another way, e.g. a database. So maybe the encoding changes. Maybe a mysql_real_escape_string() is done in PHP so stuff gets lost. Now if one wants to check the signature there might be problems.
So usually when creating signatures you have a fixed encoding and a byte sequence (or string) with some kind of unambiguous delimiter - which is not the case here.
Hence the question: How to deal with signatures in this kinda scenario?
","It is still required to have a specific message representation in bits or bytes to be able to sign it. There are two ways to do this:

just store the byte representation of the message and don't alter it afterwards (if the message is a string, first encode it with a well defined character encoding);
define a canonical representation of the message, you can either store the canonical representation the message directly or convert it in memory when you are updating the hash within your signature.

A canonical representation of a message is a special, unique representation of the data that somehow distinguishes it from all other possible messages; this may for instance also include sorting the entries of a table (as long as the order doesn't change the meaning of the table), removing whitespace etc.
XML encryption for instance contains canonicalization methods for XML encoding. Obviously it is not possible to define canonicalization for data that has no intrinsic structure. Another (even) more complicated canonical representation is DER for ASN.1 messages (e.g. X509 certificates themselves as well as within RSA signatures).

Hence the question: How to deal with signatures in this kinda scenario?
","I think you're really asking two different questions:
How should data be signed?
I suggest using standard digital signature data format when possible, and ""detached signatures"" at other times. What this means in practice: PDF, Word, Excel and other file formats that provide for digital signatures should remain in those formats. 
File formats that don't provide for digital signatures should be signed using a detached signature. The recommended standard for detached signatures is the .p7b file type–A PKCS#7 digital signature structure without the data. Here is an example of signing data with a detached signature from my company.
This means that the ""Relying Party"" -- the person downloading/receiving the information -- would download two files. The first is the original data file, unchanged. The second file will be the detached signature for the first.
Benefits The signed file formats that directly support digital signatures can have their signatures verified using the file's usual software app. Ie, the free Adobe PDF Reader app knows how to verify digitally signed PDFs. In the same way, MS Word know how to verify signed Word files.
And for the other file types, the associated detached signature file will guarantee to the recipient that the file was not modified since it was signed and who the signer was (depending on the trust issue, see below).
Re database storage -- you don't care how the data is stored on the different servers (database, file system, etc.) In any or all cases, the data should remain unchanged.
How to establish trust between the signer and the recipient
I suggest that the organization create its own root certificate. You can then put the certificate as a file on your SSL web site. (Your web site's SSL certificate should be from a CA, eg Comodo, VeriSign, etc.) The result is that people who trust your web site's SSL certificate can then trust your organizational certificate. And your signers' certificates should be chained to your organization's certificate, thus establishing trust for the recipients.
This method of creating a self-signed organizational certificate is low cost and provides a high level of trust. But relying parties will need to download and install your organization's certificate.
If that is not good, you can get certificates for your signers from a public Certificate Authority (CA), but that will drive up the cost by at least an order of magnitude due to the charges from the CA. My company, CoSign, supports all of these configurations.

I had to Normalize the point first (""pub_key_1 =pub_key_1.Normalize()"") before I could obtain the coordinates.

","With Java, you may use the well-known Bouncy Castle crypto library this way, to parse a PGP public key.
In your question, FilePath is the path to a file containing the PEM encoded public key, so here is a way to get the public exponent and modulus values:

create a key ring object parsing the content of FilePath;
extract the public key from the key ring;
convert the generic public key object to an instance of RSAPublicBCPGKey, to access the getPublicExponent() and getModulus() methods.

Here is the code snippet.
package net.fenyo.tstpgp;

import java.io.*;
import org.bouncycastle.bcpg.*;
import org.bouncycastle.openpgp.*;
import org.bouncycastle.openpgp.jcajce.*;

public class App {
    static String FilePath = ""d:/temp/publickey.pem"";

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, PGPException {
        // Import the PEM encoded key in a key ring
        JcaPGPPublicKeyRingCollection pgpPub = new JcaPGPPublicKeyRingCollection(org.bouncycastle.openpgp.PGPUtil
                .getDecoderStream(new FileInputStream(new File(FilePath))));
        // Extract the public key from the ring
        PGPPublicKey pk = pgpPub.getKeyRings().next().getPublicKey();
        RSAPublicBCPGKey rsa = (RSAPublicBCPGKey) pk.getPublicKeyPacket().getKey();

        // Display the components of the public key
        System.out.println(""public exponent: "" + rsa.getPublicExponent().toString());
        System.out.println(""modulus: "" + rsa.getModulus().toString());
    }
}

Here is an example of the output of this program, for which the content of the file d:/temp/publickey.pem has been downloaded from there: https://keyserver.pgp.com/vkd/DownloadKey.event?keyid=0x5F6C8AE0F08B18EC
public exponent: 65537

Initial: D = {""1"":2,""2"":3}
Intended as output: D = {""1"":True, ""2"":False}
Requirements: 

Inputs must be a Dictionary(D) and a RSA public key in the form of a tuple (e,N). The dictionary must contains keys as messages and values as signatures.
Outputs must be a Dictionary with keys as messages (the same as in the input), but with values expressed as True or False if the signature matches the public key values.

","It says dictionnary changed size because you’re using v instead of k as index, so it adds more pair in the dictionnary and fails, change to :

I try to recover the public key from cookie, here is what i've done, not sure if thats correct...
1) Register and login to get the cookie:
user: test
pass: asd
cookie: dGVzdC0tMEYCIQDkk9vxwQ2A81geSQSTCxQEzGwTkA7gdYR0%2BpSr6MTNEwIhAJLLemlZFZZT6unXBg4i1WvdJy6tKVJrLQmj%2FM8SujPA

2) Decode the cookie as a url:

3) Decode the cookie as a base64

4) Decode the part of cookie after ""--"" as a ECDSA (DER) lets say its 'sig'.
    ECDSA::Format::SignatureDerString.decode(sig)
<ECDSA::Signature:0x000056532e7cc928 @s=66397190700537287645903651815357348182011798486667182586289641565984306901952, @r=103388573995635080359749164254216598308788835304023601477803095234286494993683>

5) Check the code: (this is not important now*)
*============================================================
$group = Secp256k1
$private_key = UNKNOWN

def sign(str)
    digest = Digest::SHA256.digest(str) 
    temp_key = str.size 
    signature = ECDSA.sign($group, $private_key, digest, temp_key)
end

temp_key = 'test'.size ==> 4

=============================================================*
6) PUBLIC KEY RECOVERY:
1) Check if s and r are integer:
signature.r.class
signature.s.class

2) Calculate curve point R (x1,y1) where x(h) x can be r, r+n (r+2n etc.) depens on h value in $group.
Convert n from hex

3) Calculate the xj when h = 1 ==>   j <= h 
So i got x0 = r and x1 = r + n
x0 = 103388573995635080359749164254216598308788835304023601477803095234286494993683

# y² = x³ + 7  ==> x³ + 7 - y² = 0  ==> y = sqrt(x³ + 7)
    So there are Y that can be -Y.

y0 = (Math.sqrt(x0**3 + 7)).to_i 
y0 = 33243658930125968263381409750062872803328956523994685349884711523646619725501695561221713273581676204319400941060096

Now its time to calcluate the Qa for every R. R0, R0m, R1, R1m, but i feel like i wasted time... Could somebody look at this and help me understand how to recover the public key from cookie?

"58520237","OpenSSL server public key from buffer to EVP_PKEY","I'm programming a client that partecipates in a TLS 1.2 handshake by sending messages through a TCP socket connected to Google's server. I'm using the ECDH key exchange method.
I am trying to derive the shared secret using this code.
I received the key through the serverKeyExchange message and stored it in a buffer, so my question is: how do I generate a EVP_PKEY from a buffer?
I found a possible solution in this post and tried with:
i2d_PublicKey(peerkey, (unsigned char **) &server_pub_key)

but when I run the code I get an error in this step:
/* Provide the peer public key */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_derive_set_peer(ctx, peerkey)) handleErrors();

Which makes me think that I have not succeded at retrieving the server Public key.
Any Suggestions? How do I even know if the key was succesfully encoded?
","If you have the raw public key you must create an EC_Key with the correct parameters.
EVP_PKEY * get_peerkey(const unsigned char * buffer, size_t buffer_len)
{
    EC_KEY *tempEcKey = NULL;
    EVP_PKEY *peerkey = NULL;

    // change this if another curve is required
    tempEcKey = EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name(NID_X9_62_prime256v1);
    if(tempEcKey == NULL) {
        handleErrors();
    }

    if(EC_KEY_oct2key(tempEcKey, buffer, buffer_len, NULL) != 1)  {
        handleErrors();
    }

    if(EC_KEY_check_key(tempEcKey) != 1) {
        handleErrors();
    }

    peerkey = EVP_PKEY_new();
    if(peerkey == NULL) {
        handleErrors();
    }

    if(EVP_PKEY_assign_EC_KEY(peerkey, tempEcKey)!= 1) {
        handleErrors();
    }

    return peerkey;
}

If you have the public key as an ASN.1 sequence you can use the internal conversion methods:
EVP_PKEY* get_peerkey(const unsigned char *buffer, size_t buffer_len)
{
    EVP_PKEY *peerkey = NULL;       
    const unsigned char *helper = buffer;

    // from ""openssl/x509.h""
    peerkey = d2i_PUBKEY(NULL, &helper, buffer_len);
    if (!peerkey) {
        handleErrors();
        return NULL;
    }

    return peerkey;

Data describing the accounts is stored in a p2p-system, so we need a lookup key for each account, which is globally unique (i.e. a globalID (GID).
Question is: how do I choose these global IDs wisely? I mean in a manner that if there is an attack on the underlying p2p-system, an attacker would have a really hard time to exchange the keys.
I was thinking: Hashing the public key (with a salt), using this as the GID and signing the result would do the trick.
This way, if an attacker exchanges the key the GID wouldn't match any more (even though the attacker would be able to create a new valid signature). The only way for the attack to succeed is to find a collision for the GID, which can then be used as the public key, while there's still the problem of finding the matching private key in order to create signatures.
First approach: sha256(PubKey + Salt) = GID
Second approach: sha256(PubKey + Salt) + md5(PubKey + Salt) = GID
Third approach: PBKDF2(PubKey, sha256, Salt) = GID

Any thoughts on that?

EDIT: Some more details:
In this system/architecture, users should be able to setup an account with a globally unique ID, which is linked to an endpoint of some sort associated with this user. Very similar to the DNS. But without domains.
For signing purposes etc (not relevant here), each user has a public key pair. So the public key needs to be published in some way. 

Use case: Bob knows Alice's globalID and needs to ""get"" to her endpoint. She queries some system and receives a (signed) response comprising information about the endpoint as well as Alice's public key. With the public key, Bob verifies the signature. All done.

Now assume that there is no central authority and noone that runs a (semi-) central trustworthy system like the DNS that Bob can query. Solution could be a p2p/DHT system. So let's assume we use a Kademlia DHT to store and distribute this data records (globalID, public Key, endpoint data, signature). Problem is: everyone can easily overwrite any kind of data in those systems.
Scenario: Assume, an attacker Charlie could somehow overwrite such a record in an easy way by just creating his own new pub-key, setting the globalID to Alice's GID and signing this all with HIS private key. Now Bob would not be able to detect that Charlie is impersonating Alice by just knowing her globalID.
Therefore, the globalID should be directly linked to the public key, e.g. by using one of the approaches mentioned above. Therefore, when Charlie tries to attack again in the same way he would need to find a collision in the hash function and use it as his public key (then ""generating"" the matching private key to create the correct signature).
Question is now how to generate the GID from the public key or whether there is a major flaw in the system.
Hope this clarifies things a bit...

"53100500","Old client's SSL certificate and new certificate with same pub/private key","Situation: we can't update der file on the client's device. And the SSL certificate on our web server expires soon. 
Is it possible to renew the server's SSL certificate without replacing the client's certificate? 
We want to follow this guide: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/how-to-issue-a-new-ssl-certificate-with-an-old-ssl-key/
However, we are not sure if it helps. 
The question is:
Does the der file (on the client side) contain only public key and it is safe to renew SSL certificate using the technique described in the link above (keeping same pub/private keys). 
Will it work on client's device without replacing der file? Or der file contains not only the public key for SSL certificate but also some other information? 
","I'm afraid, but based on your original post and clarifications, client will expect from web server the same server certificate as stored in DER file on client device. Client performs exact binary copy comparison (not only public keys).
Any attempts to replace server certificate will result in a connection failure on client. If you plan to replace the certificate on web server, you will have to update client devices as well.
Unfortunately, there are a lot of flawed HPKP implementations (to be honest, didn't see any reliable implementation) that work fine until server certificate is changed. In order to properly handle server certificate replacement, client MUST be able to store at least two server certificates, existing and new one. Here is the high-level server certificate replacement process:

acquire new server certificate from CA in advance.
make application update by including new certificate side-by-side. When client updates the application on their device, client app will trust both, existing and new certificate.
give clients a time to make app update on their devices. Ideally, you should wait until all clients have updated app version with updated certificate.
change SSL certificate in server bindings.
after aa time you can make another update for client certificate by removing expired certificate from trust store.

only this step sequence may guarantee uninterrupted certificate pinning renewal.

SSO
POST calls

and, we know that GET is not a good choice, but I´ll need to use it. So, I think to use something like ""public keys"", what you think about this approach?
I think in:

User do authentication in application A.
Into application A, have a link to application B; User click on this link
Application A open application B page sending a ""public key"" (database persistent authentication key?)
Application B validate this key and authorize or not the user.

","In step 3, rather than thinking of a ""public key"", think of a ""session token"". Specifically, A redirects to B with
http://b.application.com?token=123-3-2-1-3-2-2-1-2-32-3-5-2-4-5245
Tokens should be unique and short-living.
B then contacts A directly and asks about the identity behind the session token:
http://a.application.com/userservice/getuser/123-3-2-1-3-2-2-1-2-32-3-5-2-4-5245
Because B contacts A directly, there is no way for users to forge invalid tokens - a random token just points to non-existing session at A.

 00000000000000000400000000000000

It is defined by ECMA-335 (CLI specs) as Ecma/Standard Public Key. It is used to compute Public Key Token b77a5c561934e089. However, in order to create and then later verify the assembly signature (strong name) you need real keys. A real RSA Public Key is always at least 128 bytes. So where is it? 
Many such assemblies include AssemblyKeyFileAttribute with the file EcmaPublicKey.snk. But this file contains only 16 bytes for Ecma Public Key itself meaning it is used only for building assembly and not for loading. Also, such assemblies use both 128-byte and 256-byte strong name signatures meaning the Ecma public key has to map into at least two different RSA key pairs of different sizes.
I noticed that the Mono project uses config files where the b77a5c561934e089 is mapped into a real Public Key but Windows probably handles it a different way. I found some old posts related to this issue but none provides any legitimate answers.

"34700665","Public Key for decryption","Questions about public keys:

Can a PUBLIC key be created such that it can work for both encryption and decryption? (of the same object/code, of course)
Can a PUBLIC key be created for decryption only? (when encryption is done with the PRIVATE key). I mean, such that if used for encryption it CANNOT decrypt what it has encrypted?

","A Public key is exactly what it describes.  Public.  If you want a public key that both encrypts and decrypts, then it is no longer a public, nor asymmetric key.  It's just a standard symmetric key, for algorithms like AES etc.  Does this sound like what you want to do?
For your second question, a Public Key and Private Key are derived from a mathematical relationship. The RSA Private Key actually contains the Public Exponent and Modulus (among other components) that can be used to directly create the Public Key. Thus, if you have the Private Key, you also have the Public Key. Your second scenario is then not secure.
You might be interested in signing data using a Private Key and verifying the data using a Public Key.  This is common in SSL Certificates.

I could zip up the expansion file using a password, but that would require me to embed the password into the source code of the app. This is not very effective since anyone could decompile the app and retrieve the password.
What I want is three things:

1- A tool that allows me to sign the file using a private key (a random string).

2- A Java library that allows me to verify the signed file using...

Here’s what works :

encrypt_public in NodeJS -> decrypt_private NodeJS (Works)
encrypt_public in Elixir -> decrypt_pricate in Elixir (Works)

But :

encrypt_public in NodeJS -> decrypt_private in Elixir (Does Not Work)

It seems that an encrypt_public from Node, can’t be decrypted by a decrypt_private in Elixir.
I even tried the hard way directly with the Erlang module public_key, it gives me the same result.
Here’s what I tried :
var fs = require(""fs"")
var crypto = require(""crypto"")

var rsa_key = fs.readFileSync('./priv/public.key').toString()
var rsa_priv = fs.readFileSync('./priv/private.key').toString()
var buffer = Buffer.from(""Hello world"")
var encrypted_auth = crypto.publicEncrypt({key: rsa_key}, buffer)
console.log(""copy/paste this in iex: "", encrypted_auth.toString(""Base64""))
var crypted_buffer = Buffer.from(encrypted_auth)
var decrypted_auth = crypto.privateDecrypt({key: rsa_priv, passphrase: ""my_pass_phrase""}, crypted_buffer)
console.log(""--- Res: "", decrypted_auth.toString())

But as soon as you copy/paste the Base64 generated in Node Here’s what I get :
key = ExPublicKey.load!(""./priv/private.key"", ""my_pass_phrase"")
cipher = ""PASTED BASE64 FROM NODE""
ExPublicKey.decrypt_private(cipher, key)

returns :error
I have suspected the rsa padding to be different, but it doesn’t seems to be that… Does anyone have a clue ?
","There were 2 issues
The padding by default in Node is : RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING
while the default one is erlang is : rsa_pkcs1_padding
the solution is to modify the padding in Node : 
var encrypted_auth = crypto.publicEncrypt({key: rsa_key, padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_PADDING}, buffer)

The second issue, was that EXPublicKey was trying to Base.url_decode64 while the Base64 generated by Node is not url safe
To fix that : 
ExPublicKey.decrypt_private(cipher, key, url_safe: false)

In first method user provides corresponding private key. But in second method how authentication mechanism know what is the corresponding private key as user not supply the private key.

The client is using private keys in default location (~/.ssh/id_{rsa,dsa,ecdsa,ed25519}).

Can we arrange pass wordless authentication like ssh -i id_rsa ec2-user@52.48.32.12

Yes, the filename does not matter. But of course it has to be a valid private key.

Can we use two public keys and two private keys to authenticate to the same server from same client.

Yes. But servers are usually fine with accepting single key, so there is no need to do that.

I was sent these directions:

Hmm, let's see.

Export the Public Key (.p7b or .cer) and the Private Key (.pfx) from the certificate.

Impossible. The private key isn't in the certificate. And there is no reason to export the public key. It's of no use without the certificate.

Set a password for your Private Key (.pfx).

Good.

Use your private key as your signing certificate.

This is completed and utter nonsense. A private key cannot be used as a certificate. It isn't a certificate. [It can however be used to sign things: if that's what they're talking about they should have said so, clearly.]

When you send a submission you will be prompted to enter in your signing certificate password, this will be the password you set for your Private Key (.pfx).

More nonsense, see above.

After you have exported both files successfully, send us a copy of your new Public Key (.p7b or .cer) to: [] 

Yet more nonsense. Sending the public key accomplishes nothing, and a .cer file isn't a key file, it's a certificate file.

I understand that .p7b or .cer  and .pfx would have the certificate included. So -- are they calling the public key plus the certificate, and the private key plus certificate, ""public key"" and ""private key""? 

They are talking rank nonsense. If those are really the directions you were sent, tell them so, send them back, get your money back, and start all over again with somebody that actually knows what they're talking about. These instructions cannot possibly have been even tested.

Is this the usual way this is done?

It is drivel.

"55363375","What is the most appropriated and secure way to encrypt files using private/public keys in Node.js","I was wondering in which use case i should use these methods when encrypting and decrypting files in my node.js application.
The Problem
I want to encrypt some files in my server, after asking other people, i realized that the most recommended method is encrypt those files (larges) using a private key.
Now, i was looking for the docs and saw these methods

crypto.publicEncrypt(pubKey, buffer)
crypto.publicDecrypt(pubKey, buffer)
crypto.privateEncrypt(privKey, buffer)
crypo.privateDecrypt(privKey, buffer)

this is very confusing because i don't know what of them i must to use now, ahm... i don't know what is the most appropriate way to do this securely.
","tl;dr encrypt with the public key. Keep your private key safe.
Unfortunately, these methods are poorly named. privateEncrypt should be called something like sign and publicDecrypt should be called something like verify.
When using public-key encryption (also known as asymmetric encryption), one key can be used to write a cipher and the other key can undo that operation. Your public key is potentially known to everyone, and your private key is secret.
If you want to keep something secret, except from the owner of a certain key, you want to encrypt a message with their public key. So if Alice wants to receive encrypted messages, she'll share her public key A_pub and her secret key A_priv, she'll keep to herself.. You'll encrypt your message crypto.publicEncrypt(A_pub, buffer). She'll then decrypt that message with crypto.privateDecrypt(A_priv, buffer).
Doing it the other way is known as a digitial signature.

"25550316","What is the best way to implement public key authentication in my automated root password change script?","Here are some details about my setup...
Current environment:

40+ *nix systems managed by 6 admins
Highly secure, closed network (no internet access)
Regularly audited (all account passwords must be changed every 90 days)

Current procedures:

Each administrator has a personal account with sudo access. These admin accounts are managed via Active Directory so password changes are not an issue
Root account is also active for specific circumstances (i.e. admin account is locked out)
When it comes time to change the root passwords, an admin will do so by SSHing into each system (40+)

I want to write a script to make the root password changing process more efficient and everything I've read indicates that the most secure way to go about it is by using public key authentication. So my question is: If I log in as root to SYSTEM_1 and set up the public/private key pairs between that system and SYSTEM_2, SYSTEM_3, etc, does that mean I will only be able to run the script from SYSTEM_1? Is this even a good idea security wise? Are there any other ways to script this that I am missing?
","You can use RSA Authentication and expect script
Let's say you are executing expect script on system 1, create public-private key pair and store public key on all the other systems you have to login (system 2.....n) 
Now you wont need a password when you ssh into those system.
Now you can use expect script to change password for either root or any other user. 
NOTE : usually expect interpreter is at     /usr/bin/expect
you can find this my doing ""whereis expect""
I hope it helps.
Try to use this algorithm and post your results.

"56298281","How does API authentication works with only public key on javascript?","English is not my first language. I'll do my best to explain my self.

I am creating an API to be used by clients via Javascript. The client should include on his website something like this:
<script>
    var my_api = { 
        public_key: ""123456""
    };
</script>
<script async src=""https://api.example.com/v1/init.js""></script>

So... how can I use a Public Key to verify the client's website?
I know I can get the referer and compare it in with the key on my database, but:
(a) If the referer may be faked, a public key won't be useful because is already public 
And (b) if the referer can't be faked, Why would I use a public key? Is not enougth with the referer? 
I can't ask the client to encrypt something to varify if he have the right key if anybody can knows the key... 
I have only created APIs with both private and public key (or only private) in the past.
Finally, I want it all be installed on client's website by copy/pasting few lines of JS code (that's why I want only use public key). 
I know it is possible because that's how Google Ads works, I just need help to figure out the way.

Note: I searched for other topic on the forum but I couldn't find any answer, just thing related the SSH and nodeJS. I am developing a simple API with PHP and pure JS.
","The problem that you might run into with putting the api key on their website is that it could be viewed by anyone and used.

I tried doing git remote add production ssh://ubuntu@ec2-35-154-37-131.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com/var/repos/site.git

That is expected, because SSH will look for your key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa by default.
Since you don't have a default key, you need to define a ~/.ssh/config file (chmod 644), with:
Host myaws
Hostname ec2-35-154-37-131.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
User ubuntu
IdentityFile /full/path/to/wexpert_instance_2.pem

Then:
git remote set-url production myaws:/var/repo/site.git

"56419381","JWS kid header needed before reading JWS headers with JJWT","the API I am building receives JWS tokens. I want to ask from clients to set the kid header so I can provide for key rotation. However, JJWT understandably doesn't allow me to read the kid header before I provide the public key for validation:
A signing key must be specified if the specified JWT is digitally signed
But I need the kid header to select the right 'signing' key in the first place. Bit of a chicken and egg problem. How should I approach this? Do I just ask my clients to provide the kid value both in the JWS header and as a normal HTTP header?
","Ah, heck, already found it. JJWT uses a SigningKeyResolver for this particular case. It allows programmers to inspect headers or claims if these are needed to determine the right key to use. More here:

I have Bob's public key and I am 100% sure that this is real Bob's public key. How can I verify that this is really Bob who is chatting with me?
a] I will ask the guy to send me a file signed by him. Then I will verify the signature.
b] I will send the guy a file signed by real Bob's public key and ask him to verify the file.
c] I will send the guy a file and ask him to sign it. Then I will verify his signature.
I think option A] makes sense. Am I correct? This is just a hypothetical situation.
","I would suggest the following:
Your ""friends"" can encrypt messages using GPG:
gpg --encrypt --sign --armor -r your-user-id some-message.txt

This will encrypt some-message.txt using your public key (your-user-id) and signs it with their own private key to guarantee that it is coming from them.
Provided you have already added their public key, when you receive the message, simply call GPG on the message file:
gpg some-message.txt

At the end, I managed to make it working, but do not understand the reason yet:

","The simplest way, although it feels rather ugly to me, is to convert the private key 'back' to one of OpenSSL's 'legacy' forms, which PEMParser is then able to turn into a PEMKeyPair with both halves, from which the public can be selected. Otherwise, the method must be tailored depending on the key algorithm aka type, but can be more efficient which I like better. Here are both options for your consideration:

private static RSAParameters privateKey;
private static RSAParameters publicKey;

{
  var rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();
  privateKey = rsa.ExportParameters(true);
  publicKey = rsa.ExportParameters(false);

I use this to encrypt data with the recipient's public key [Using(publicKey).Encrypt(originalData)] so that the receiver only can decrypt the data [Using(privateKey).Decrypt(encryptedData)].
Now I want to reuse asymetric encryption for the following use case: The recipient publishes data and everyone who knows the recipient's public key (which is basically everyone in the system, but nobody outside the system e.g. a protection against leaking readable data to the public) can read it. The publisher uses his private key to encrypt and his public key would be used to decrypt:
byte[] originalData = GenerateRandomData();
byte[] publishedData = Using(privateKey).Encrypt(originalData, false);
byte[] retrievedData = Using(publicKey).Decrypt(publishedData, false);
Debug.Assert(originalData.SequenceEqual(retrievedData));

However this yields a
System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException
  HResult=0x8009000D
  Message=Keyset does not exist.

I do not want to use a different public-private-key-pair for data publishing part, especially in this scenario it means making public a private key. It already sound awkward when typing...
EDIT: Is there an asymetric encryption contained in .NET framework which allows me to use both keys (public and private) in both directions where if one key is used for encryption only the other one can be used to decrypt?
","RSA signing is not the same as encrypting with the private key.
PKCS#1 v1.5 signature:

Hash the content with a chosen algorithm.
Create a DigestInfo value to represent the hash.
Apply padding to make a message almost, but not quite, the size of the modulus (details omitted here).
Apply the RSA primitive with the private key

Note that last step doesn’t say “encrypt”.
The RSA classes in .NET do the padding and such for you, so they expose Sign/Verify and Encrypt/Decrypt. You can’t use them for cross purposes, and you can’t use these classes for the RSA primitive (aka “raw RSA”).

","after reading more about RSA i understand that there is no way to do what i want (to wrap messages one on one with different RSA-keys and them unwrap them again).
so i choose another algorithm:
i used RAC4 - a symmetric algorithm to encrypt the messages
i used RSA - to send the RAC4-key over the network

","I'm amazed this isn't a dupe, but I couldn't find a good one. 
Although Bouncy is fine and has many features if you want to use it, core Java can handle X.509 certificates since forever. For a cert in a file (or anything that can be accessed as a Stream) in either PEM or DER format (although the javadoc isn't clear on that) all you need is CertificateFactory:
CertificateFactory fact = CertificateFactory.getInstance(""X.509"");

// from a real file
InputStream is = new FileInputStream (""filename"");
Certificate cert = fact.generateCertificate(is);
is.close(); // or use try-resources to do automatically

// from an alternate/custom filesystem, such as a ZIP
Path p = Paths.get(""somespecification""); // or any other creation of a Path
InputStream is = Files.newInputStream(p); // add open options if needed
// same as before

// from the classpath (usually a JAR)
InputStream is = ClassLoader /*or any Class<?> object*/ .getResourceAsStream(""name"");
// same as before

// from a byte[] in memory
InputStream is = new ByteArrayInputStream (bytearray);
// same as before, except don't really need to close

// you get the idea

Although JCA APIs like this one are defined to allow a lot of extension,  reading an X.509 cert will actually give you not just Certificate but subclass X509Certificate from which .getNotAfter() gives the expiration date-time directly. The email address if present (which isn't required by X.509 certs in general, but should always be the case in a cert used for S/MIME) will usually be an attribute in the subject name, which actually has internal structure that Java doesn't let you get at directly so you need to:
String x500name = ((X509Certificate)cert).getSubjectX500Principal()) .toString();
// simple case: no multivalue RDN, no reserved chars ,+=""<>\;# or extra spaces 
for( String attr : x500name.split("", "") )
  if( attr.startsWith(""EMAILADDRESS="") ) 
    ... use attr.substring(13) ...
// other cases require slightly more complicated parsing 

Note there is no encryption at all in X.509, and thus no actual decryption, although many people use 'decrypt' to describe anything unfamiliar not an actual cipher.

"50292250","Where to save client's public key and retrieve to encrypt data","I have a public key of customer that I need to use to encrypt credentials and send to the customer to obtain an auth token that I will be using for all further communication with the customer services.
For testing purpose, I saved the public key into a file and I am able to successfully obtain the auth token.
Now, the question is, where do I need to store this key safely. Options that I can think of are web.config as it is not browsable, or keep it in a file. Both seems to be unsafe.
If I keep it in a file, can I save it into windows trusted store? If yes, how can I save it and since in the trusted store, I will have multiple such keys, how I will retrieve this particular key to encrypt the credentials next time when I need to encrypt.
I am using windows machine for production server and .NET to encrypt, just in case it makes difference.
","I think you can encrypt this certificate with another rsa key pair. Save key and encrypted data in different platform. For example save encrypted data in db and save rsa key in file system in protected folder. Protected folder can be user directory which has application user. Encrypt certificate out of the platform with separate tool. Don't save your rsa private key in application system.

","pub_data.equals(pub_data2) does not do what you think. It compares the references, not the array contents. You want to use Arrays.equals(pub_data, pub_data2).
See equals vs Arrays.equals in Java.

Btw, technically you cannot create a public key from a private key. But as KeyPair.writePrivateKey actually writes a whole key pair, not the private key only, it naturally contains the public key too.

","I finally managed to fix my authentication problem. I decided to include pre generated public and private key to my app (not generated automatically anymore). I also installed bouncy castle library for C# to parse private key provided by adb. Public key problem fixed.
Turned out that my signing method is also wrong. Here is the correct one (using bouncy castle):
public static byte[] SignDataSHA1(byte[] data, AsymmetricKeyParameter privateKey)
{
    // Converting bouncy castle key to native csp.
    RSAParameters rsaParam = DotNetUtilities.ToRSAParameters(privateKey as RsaPrivateCrtKeyParameters);

    using (RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider())
    {
        rsa.ImportParameters(rsaParam);

        // Signing data.
        return rsa.SignHash(data, CryptoConfig.MapNameToOID(""SHA1""));
    }
}

I basically just tell the signer that the data already hashed and voila, it worked.

"53229641","How can I tell if given data is encrypted with a public key","I'm going to re-phrase my question completely so it makes more general sense (and correct my blunder with AES/RSA).
Alice has a large block of data to send to Bob via a local mailbox that isn't secure.  To keep her data from prying eyes, she does this:

She generates a random 256-bit key
She uses AES-256 encryption to encrypt the data using the key
She uses Bob's public key to encrypt the key she's used
She puts the encrypted data and the encrypted key in the mailbox addressed to Bob

Mike the mailman picks up the mail from the mailbox.  However, he doesn't want to lug the data all the way across the internet to Bob's place if bob isn't going to be able to decrypt it.
The question is, how can Mike ascertain whether the key has actually been encrypted using Bob's public key?
In my application I need to transport sensitive data to a data centre.  To achieve this, I have an upload process that accepts files (that have already been AES-encrypted with a key, then the key is encrypted with the recipient's public key) and sends them to the data centre.  The corresponding private key is held at the data centre and used to decrypt the files on receipt.  This is currently in the design stage so there is some flexibility on the public/private key technology to be used but it's likely to be a C# application that's doing the work.
I would like to protect against uploading files that have NOT been encrypted using the public key (because I may waste significant bandwidth and the receiving application at the datacentre will fail to decrypt them).
So, what I want to know is how can I tell at the sending end whether a file has been encrypted using a given public key?
In a nutshell, I have an encrypted file and a public key.  Has the file been encrypted with that key?
Thanks in advance etc.!

Thanks and Sorry for my english.
","As far as the cause for the discrepancy is concerned, your question is a duplicate of this question; the answer explains:

The difference is that Adobe presents the hex dump of the complete SubjectPublicKeyInfo object (the public key including the algorithm information and the key value) while your code only dumps the RSAPublicKey (the key itself).
...

For more details read there.
You actually can recognize the plain public key in the Adobe Reader output, it starts at the end of the first line, 

[...] 30 82 02
0A 02 82 02 01 00 FA 8B ...


The solution is slightly different, though, as the code in that question is in Java.
Your code uses the System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates class X509Certificate2. As far as I can see this class does not expose the whole SubjectPublicKeyInfo by itself. Thus you should use a different class here.
An obvious choice would be BouncyCastle classes, either X509CertificateStructure or X509CertificateHolder, depending on the BouncyCastle version you use (an older version of BouncyCastle is included in iTextSharp, newer ones can be retrieved from their web site). These classes expose the SubjectPublicKeyInfo.

3.do not use any way that needs to store some data on the key receiver.
the only way that i can see is sending a random message that encrypted by the public key and ask from the key owner the decrypted message to compare them and ensure the public key sender have its private key too; but this way needs a promise like and two steps to verifying and storing some data:

receive a public key and send the encrypted random string and wait
receive the decrypted data and compare them with original string

now do you know any way to do this verifying without need to storing any data 
and just do it with a single request may be by some extra data to send by the public key or some thing else?

","Using S/MIME as an example, one pre-requisite of encrypting a message to the recipient is to have their Public Certificate. 
Now, of course, the recipient can first send you their certificate as an attachment, however, it is more common for the recipient to first send you a signed email. 
This signed email would prove that the recipient has access to their private key as they would hash the contents of the email and then sign the hash with their private key. 
You would then verify the hash with their public key (the certificate is sent along side the email) and comparing that hash to the hash of the MIME content of the email.

","I should have checked a few things as follows:

To copy public key from a client machine to the server using ""ssh-copy-id"" command (example is shown below), I need to change a option of sshd_config file to 'yes' on the server computer.
Command: 
$ ssh-copy-id ~/.ssh/id_rsa netcomo@netcomoserver
$ sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PasswordAuthentication yes
After copying the public key to the server, the 'yes' changed above needs to be changed back to 'no'
For your reference, if you need to access multiple server accounts, you have to copy the same public key for each different accounts, see examples that follow.
$ ssh-copy-id ~/.ssh/id_rsa netcomo@netcomoserver
$ ssh-copy-id ~/.ssh/id_rsa netcomo2@netcomoserver

","The uncompressed key is too long, you are right.
The compressed key is the uncompressed key as Base58 data.
Satoshi decided to use Base58 because Base58 has only characters which do not look similar (Like ""O"" and""0""). Also Base58 strings are much smaller and more readable. There are several libraries which help you to convert data to Base58 and vice versa.

Summary of the problem:
I'm trying to push to a remote repository on Github, but it is giving me this error:
Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '192.30.253.112' to the list of known hosts.
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.*
Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
Background on what I did:
I added a remote repo as usual by getting the url shown on Github. The command I typed was:
git remote add origin https://github.com/bowtie/myremote.git
Then I checked my remote repos by typing git remote -v and, even though I added an https url, it shows urls with ""ssh"" in front of them:
 git remote -v
origin  ssh://git@github.com/bowtie/myremote.git (fetch)
origin  ssh://git@github.com/bowtie/myremote.git (push)
Then I tried to push anyway, at which point it gave me the error I mentioned:
git push --set-upstream origin master
Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '192.30.253.112'
to the list of known hosts.
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
Why is it showing ssh even though I added the url as https? I tried changing it using git remote set-url, nothing changed. I removed the url completely then readded it and it still added the ""ssh"" to it. I checked the git config file, and the url is written correctly with https inside it, then why is it showing ssh on the command line? 
By the way, I had another remote and when I encountered this problem, I deleted the .git file from the local repo and reinitialised it, then created another remote, thinking maybe the problem was in the remote. But still the problem persisted. I had tried to change from https to ssh before, but I couldn't get the key. Right now, I just want git bash to show me the correct url without the ssh:// and to push my commits. Thoughts?
","I figured out where the problem was. I had previously made a command to replace every https with ssh using insteadOf, which applies to all git operations. I fixed it by fixing the git config --global file.
The command I used was something like this :
git config --global url.""git@github.com:"".insteadOf ""https://github.com/""
The solution is to edit the config global file by using:
git config --global --edit and delete the line manually
I found the problem explained here: https://discuss.bitrise.io/t/git-force-to-use-ssh-url-instead-of-https-for-github-com/4384

"56493202","Could SSL pinning be applied to a portion of an application's code?","I know (please correct me if I'm wrong) that SSL-pinning consists of hard-coding the public key of the server in the application, so during the handshake protocol, when the client receives a hello server message, it will compare the server's public key to the one on the application's code, if they don't match the client will end the authentication.
I am trying to understand how certificate pinning works? Here is what I do:
I am proxing the traffic coming from an Android application to my server. The application is constantly making requests to the server so it can update it's content, but those requests are issued automatically by the application, and mimtproxy does intercept them.
Now when I send a request from the application, mitmproxy does not intercept it. It only intercepts the ones issued automatically by the application
Things I tried to do:

I've rooted my android device, and mimtproxy still can't intercept the traffic.
I've installed mitmproxy certificate on the root store on my android device.

The topology I'm using:
Client (Android 6.0.1) --> proxy (mitmproxy running on linux) --> server
According to some research I made about certificate pinning, the client ends the conversation as soon as the public key it receives is not the one it trusts. However, in my case, the proxy keeps receiving the requests that the application is sending automatically which brings me to my question: Can certificate pinning be applied to portions of an application's code? for example, when the client sends a specific request we check the public key it's received and we neglect this for other requests?
