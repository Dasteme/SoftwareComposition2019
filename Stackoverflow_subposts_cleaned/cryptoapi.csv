"3208160","How to generate an HMAC in Java equivalent to a Python example?","I'm looking at implementing an app getting Twitter authorization via Oauth in Java. The first step is getting a request token. Here is a Python example for app engine. 
To test my code, I am running Python and checking output with Java. Here is an example of Python generating a Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC):
#!/usr/bin/python

from hashlib import sha1
from hmac import new as hmac

key = ""qnscAdgRlkIhAUPY44oiexBKtQbGY0orf7OV1I50""
message = ""foo""

print ""%s"" % hmac(key, message, sha1).digest().encode('base64')[:-1]

Output:
$ ./foo.py
+3h2gpjf4xcynjCGU5lbdMBwGOc=

How does one replicate this example in Java?
I've seen an example of HMAC in Java:
try {
    // Generate a key for the HMAC-MD5 keyed-hashing algorithm; see RFC 2104
    // In practice, you would save this key.
    KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""HmacMD5"");
    SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();

    // Create a MAC object using HMAC-MD5 and initialize with key
    Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(key.getAlgorithm());
    mac.init(key);

    String str = ""This message will be digested"";

    // Encode the string into bytes using utf-8 and digest it
    byte[] utf8 = str.getBytes(""UTF8"");
    byte[] digest = mac.doFinal(utf8);

    // If desired, convert the digest into a string
    String digestB64 = new sun.misc.BASE64Encoder().encode(digest);
} catch (InvalidKeyException e) {
} catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
} catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
}

It uses javax.crypto.Mac, all good. However, the SecretKey constructors take bytes and an algorithm. 
What's the algorithm in the Python example? How can one create a Java secret key without an algorithm?
","HmacSHA1 seems to be the algorithm name you need:
SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(
        ""qnscAdgRlkIhAUPY44oiexBKtQbGY0orf7OV1I50"".getBytes(),
        ""HmacSHA1"");

Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA1"");
mac.init(keySpec);
byte[] result = mac.doFinal(""foo"".getBytes());

BASE64Encoder encoder = new BASE64Encoder();
System.out.println(encoder.encode(result));

produces:

Note that I've used sun.misc.BASE64Encoder for a quick implementation here, but you should probably use something that doesn't depend on the Sun JRE. The base64-encoder in Commons Codec would be a better choice, for example.

","A minor thing but if you are looking for an equivalent to hmac(key,message) then by default the python library will use the MD5 algorithm, so you need to use the HmacMD5 algorithm in Java.
I mention this because I had this exact problem and found this answer which was helpful, but I missed the part where a digest method was passed in to hmac() and thus went down a rabbit hole. Hopefully this answer will prevent others doing the same in the future.
e.g. in Python REPL
>>> import hmac
>>> hmac.new(""keyValueGoesHere"", ""secretMessageToHash"").hexdigest()
'1a7bb3687962c9e26b2d4c2b833b2bf2'

This is equivalent to the Java method:
import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Hex;
import javax.crypto.Mac;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

public class HashingUtility {
    public static String HMAC_MD5_encode(String key, String message) throws Exception {

        SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(
                key.getBytes(),
                ""HmacMD5"");

        Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(""HmacMD5"");
        mac.init(keySpec);
        byte[] rawHmac = mac.doFinal(message.getBytes());

        return Hex.encodeHexString(rawHmac);
    }
}

Note that in my example I'm doing the equivalent of .hexdigest()

Never compare the return value of crypto_alloc_hash function to NULL for detecting the failure.

Always use IS_ERR function for this purpose. Comparing to NULL does not capture the error, hence you get segmentation faults later on.

    err = GetLastError();
    fprintf(stderr, ""Error: 0x%x\n"", err);
}
CryptGetUserKey(hCryptProv, pinfo->dwKeySpec, &hUserkey);

This code is mostly copied from the OpenSSL capi engine. Since the engine failed, I created the smallest possible code to search the error.
The error
If I run this, it fails with the output Error: 0x80090016. This means one of three things according to Microsoft:

Key container does not exist.
You do not have access to the key container.
The Protected Storage Service is not running.

What have I done so far?

Started service ""Protected Storage""
Verified container exists with MMC & Certificate Snap-In for Local Computer
Ran the same code on the User store in user context - it worked

File System Permissions
After some googling, I tried to change permissions on the file system. I found the files by looking at the contname variable of my code and searching for the file. I changed permissions on them (more accurate, I changed permissions on the parent folder). While this fixed the issue for MY, it seems I cannot change it for REQUEST.
One note here is that my container for MY seems to be here:
%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\S-1-5-21-1650336054-1974872081-316617838-545102

For REQUEST I found it under a different address:
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys

I am not sure on the workings here so I cannot explain why it would put them in different locations (one being user centric, the other one a system folder). The MY store was created with a regular administrator prompt and the command certreq -new inf_file.inf cert-csr.csr and after I received my certificate, I issued certreq -accept cert.pem. Then I created a new csr with the same command.
Different privilege levels
I tried to execute my program with the following privileges:

my local user account
admin prompt (cmd->start as administrator)
nt authority\system (whoami output)

To recieve a service prompt, I executed psexec.exe –ids cmd.exe according to a tip from MaaSters Center
Final words
Any help or guidance on how to further narrow this problem down will be greatly appreciated. 
","I was finally able to solve this problem and it is a lot simpler than I thought. I was sure that I would receive an unambiguous container name and don't need to be more specific but CryptAcquireContext actually requires me to pass a flag CRYPT_MACHINE_KEYSET.
So my function call has to look like this:
CryptAcquireContextA(&hCryptProv, contname, provname, pinfo->dwProvType, CRYPT_MACHINE_KEYSET)

Unfortunately this is not supported by the OpenSSL engine, so you would have to alter it yourself in the engine.

}
Now the problem is the decryption part is: Input length must be multiple of 16 when decrypting with padded cipher
I know that a mistake that I incorrectly keep a session key and bytes are lost. But how I can correctly do it?
","There is a little bit of confusion in your code, maybe because some method you called are missing, or maybe because you are using your keys to encrypt...your keys(!!!)
Let's try to encrypt and decrypt the easy way, removing all the stuff that is not strictly needed in your code (like encode your key and save it to a file, and then restore the key without decoding it, etc..).  
Let's take a look at the following simplified code based on your:
    KeyGenerator keyGenS = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""AES"");
    keyGenS.init(128);
    SecretKey sKey1 = keyGenS.generateKey();

    Cipher aesCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES"");
    aesCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE,sKey1);

    byte[] byteText = ""Insert here whatever you want to crypt"".getBytes();

    byte[] byteCipherText = aesCipher.doFinal(byteText);

We have generated our key with KeyGenerator, and then we have initialized our Cipher instance with that key. At this point we simply call doFinal() passing the plainText we want to encrypt.
That's all for the encryption part. Of course you can save your keys and byteCipherText to a file if you want, but all the other staff is (at least) useless. 
The decryption part is easy as the encryption. The logic is the same.
If you saved your key on a file, just read it into a byte[], and use it for initialize your cipher instance. Something like this:
    aesCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, sKey1);
    byte[] plainText = aesCipher.doFinal(byteCipherText);

If you put all the above code into a main() and run it, you should have into plainText the same text as in byteText.
You can verify it with a 
    System.out.println(new String(plainText));

Try to start from here, then add all other things you may need.
Hope this helps.

"4728650","How to import machine certificate into the Personal certificate store associated with a Windows service?","I am reposting my question from the MSDN forums here.
This problem has to do with importing a certificate into the personal certificate store associated with a windows service.
The name of my machine is il-mark-lap (the machine is pingable by this name).
The process:
1. There is a self signed authority certificate, let us call it NCCA. Its private key lives on another machine, let us refer it by dev-profiler.
dev-profiler> makecert -n ""CN=NCCA"" -sr localmachine -ss root -a sha1 -cy authority -r -sv NCCA.pvk NCCA.cer

2. The il-mark-lap machine certificate is created on dev-profiler and imported to the LocalComputer\My certificate store on il-mark-lap. Note, that the authority certificate (NCCA) has to be moved to LocalComputer\Root certificate store, but since I do not know how to move, I use the export-delete-import sequence.
dev-profiler> makecert -n ""CN=il-mark-lap"" -sr CurrentUser -ss My -cy end -pe -sky exchange -a sha1 -is Root -ir LocalMachine -in NCCA
dev-profiler> certutil -user -exportpfx -p 123 il-mark-lap il-mark-lap.pfx
dev-profiler> certutil -user -delstore My il-mark-lap

il-mark-lap> cscript CStore.vbs import -l LM -s My -e il-mark-lap.pfx 123
il-mark-lap> cscript CStore.vbs export -l LM -s My -subject NCCA NCCA.cer
il-mark-lap> cscript CStore.vbs delete -noprompt -l LM -subject NCCA My
il-mark-lap> cscript CStore.vbs import -l LM -s Root NCCA.cer

3. The il-mark-lap machine certificate is copied from LocalComputer\My certificate store into MSMQ\My certificate store (Message Queuing service Personal certificate store). Again, I do not know how to copy, so I use the export-import sequence.
il-mark-lap> cscript CStore.vbs export -l LM -s My -subject il-mark-lap tmp.pfx
il-mark-lap> ImportPfxIntoSrvCertStore MSMQ tmp.pfx 123

Where ImportPfxIntoSrvCertStore is my program written in C++ to import the given PFX into the Personal certificate store of the given service, MSMQ in my case.
Omitting all the error handling, the relevant  C++ code is this:
CSafeHandle pfxFileHandle(::CreateFile(wszPfxFilePath, FILE_READ_DATA, FILE_SHARE_READ, 0, OPEN_EXISTING, 0, 0));
CSafeHandle pfxFileMapping(::CreateFileMapping(pfxFileHandle, 0, PAGE_READONLY, 0, 0, 0));
CSafeMapViewOfFile pfxFileBuffer(::MapViewOfFile(pfxFileMapping, FILE_MAP_READ, 0, 0, 0));

CRYPT_DATA_BLOB blob;
blob.cbData = ::GetFileSize(pfxFileHandle, 0);
blob.pbData = LPBYTE(LPVOID(pfxFileBuffer));

CSafeCertStoreHandle pfxStore(::PFXImportCertStore(&blob, wszPassword, CRYPT_MACHINE_KEYSET | CRYPT_EXPORTABLE));
CSafeCertStoreHandle serviceStore(::CertOpenStore(CERT_STORE_PROV_SYSTEM, 0, NULL, CERT_SYSTEM_STORE_SERVICES, wszCertificateStoreName));

PCCERT_CONTEXT pctx = NULL;
while (NULL != (pctx = ::CertEnumCertificatesInStore(pfxStore, pctx)))
{
 ::CertAddCertificateContextToStore(serviceStore, pctx, CERT_STORE_ADD_REPLACE_EXISTING, NULL);
}

Ignore the CSafeXXXHandle and CSafeMapViewOfFile classes, these are simple handle/buffer holders, releasing the respective handle/buffer in the destructor (""resource acquisition is initialization"" design pattern).
Anyway, the PFXImportCertStore API fails with the message An error occurred during encode or decode operation. If I call the PFXIsPFXBlob API, it returns FALSE.
Here is the Locals debugger view at the start of the code:
+        wszPfxFilePath    0x00774e0c ""tmp.pfx""    const wchar_t *
+        wszCertificateStoreName    0x002cf7f4 ""MSMQ\My""    const wchar_t *
+        wszPassword    0x00774e1c ""123""    const wchar_t *

So, all the parameters seem to be correct.
I have no idea what is wrong. The PFX file being imported is absolutely correct, because it is imported flawlessly using the MMC console.
Incidentally, I have based my code on the example found in this article - http://www.codeguru.com/Cpp/I-N/internet/security/article.php/c6211
Edit
I would like to emphasize that I need a non interactive procedure to copy the machine certificate from LocalComputer\My to MSMQ\My.
","Instead of using a program I would try to use the certificate store mmc plugin:

Start mmc.exe, this will give you the MMC in authoring mode.
Click File -> Add/remove Snap-in
Find and double-click ""Certificates"". This will pop up a dialog where you can select which certificate storage you want to administer.
I think ""Service Account"" is the appropriate selection for you here
Click next
Select local if you are on il-mark-lap already, otherwise select ""Another computer"". AFAIK, you will have to be logged in with a domain administrator account for this to work though.
Click next
Select your service
click finish.

At this point you should already be able to access the certificate storage for your service. If you want to do this more often then I suggest you do this as well:

Right-click ""Certificates"" in the tree and select ""New Window from Here""
Switch back to the console root window and close it
Save your work of art to a .msc file

Edit
Before you save, select ""Certificates"" from the tree, and then View -> Options. Here you can select to see the ""Physical Certificate stores"" if you like.

","If you work with MSCAPI, it is assumed that you've added your key to the Microsoft Certificate store. You can check if the key is present by going to ""Internet Properties"" > ""Content"" > ""Certificates"" which gives you a list of certificates that are available. If your certificate isn't there, you can't use it. If it's there, you need this code:
SunMSCAPI providerMSCAPI = new SunMSCAPI();
Security.addProvider(providerMSCAPI);
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(""Windows-MY"");
ks.load(null, null);

From there on, the code is pretty standard. Please consult my book on digital signatures for more info (the book is free).
IMPORTANT ADDITION: I forgot to mention that SunMSCAPI isn't present in the 64-bit version of Java 6 (I don't know about Java 7). You can fix this by installing the 32-bit version.

On Windows 7, the ""(Prototype)"" provider is apparently present, but does not support the call to CryptImportPublicKeyInfo, which is confusing.
What might a correct implementation look like between these operating systems?  Is it necessary to detect XP and request the name with ""(Prototype)"", and without it for other operating systems?  Is it possible that that will still fail on some XP systems?
Or, is there a way to detect this confusing behavior and select whichever cryptographic provider will support the necessary call?

On Windows 7, the ""(Prototype)"" provider is apparently present, but does not support the call to CryptImportPublicKeyInfo, which is confusing.
What might a correct implementation look like between these operating systems?  Is it necessary to detect XP and request the name with ""(Prototype)"", and without it for other operating systems?  Is it possible that that will still fail on some XP systems?
Or, is there a way to detect this confusing behavior and select whichever cryptographic provider will support the necessary call?

","The reason of the problem which you describes is very easy: Microsoft renamed AES Cryptographic Provider from 

""Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider (Prototype)"" in Windows XP to 
""Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider"" in the later versions of the operation systems. 

In WinCrypt.h are defined the corresponding constants as MS_ENH_RSA_AES_PROV and MS_ENH_RSA_AES_PROV_XP which you can use.
If you don't want to test the version of the operation system you can just use CryptAcquireContext with NULL as pszProvider (and continue to use PROV_RSA_AES as the dwProvType). In your code you can include analyzeCryptographicSupport(NULL);.
You can also examine the ""Name"" value of the registry key
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\Defaults\Provider Types\Type 024

to see the name of the default PROV_RSA_AES provider.

","I'm not sure if this is exactly what you need but by following the example on MSDN, you can make your code succeed by making two changes.
First, MSDN says that MS_ENH_RSA_AES_PROV was named differently on Windows XP and should be used with a provider type of PROV_RSA_AES rather than PROV_RSA_FULL as in your code.
Second, trap the initial error and repeat the acquire operation for the situation where you have to create a new key container.
The following is your original code adapted according to the MSDN example, and works fine on my Windows 8 system:
int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])

        pszContainerName,
        MS_ENH_RSA_AES_PROV,
        PROV_RSA_AES,
        0))
    {

            }
        }
    }
    else
    {

        if (dwError == NTE_BAD_KEYSET)
        {

In particular I can't retrieve a key container which is already defined. I use the CryptAcquireContext() function. I use some test code where I create the container. Then If I go to C:\Users...\Roaming\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\Machine Keys\ I can see a file created with my defined container name inside so I assume it's created successfully. 
A subsequent call to try creating the same container verifies that assumption because I get the win32 error that the keyset is already defined. 
Anyway on my next code call where I try to retrieve the container I already created I get the windows error that the keyset is not defined. 

Error : -2146893799 (80090019)    The keyset is not defined.

","You are creating key container for that user, but trying to get it from machine-based storage. To fix the problem you need either change CRYPT_MACHINE_KEYSET to 0 or when creating keyset use CRYPT_NEWKEYSET | CRYPT_MACHINE_KEYSET according to your needs.

By default, keys and key containers are stored as user keys. For Base Providers, this means that user key containers are stored in the user's profile. A key container created without this flag by an administrator can be accessed only by the user creating the key container and a user with administration privileges.

Anyways in the past just reading this and unpacking was an easy task. But now in the next version the raster xml data is now to be encrypted using AES-256(Not my choice nor do we have a choice). 
Now we basically were sent the AES Key along with the SALT they are using so we can modify our unpackager. 
NOTE THESE ARE NOT THE KEYS JUST AN EXAMPLE:
They are each 63 byte long ASCII characters:
Key: ""QS;x||COdn'YQ@vs-`X\/xf}6T7Fe)[qnr^U*HkLv(yF~n~E23DwA5^#-YK|]v.""
Salt: ""|$-3C]IWo%g6,!K~FvL0Fy`1s&N<|1fg24Eg#{)lO=o;xXY6o%ux42AvB][j#/&""

We basically want to use the C++ CryptoAPI to decrypt this(I also am the only programmer here this week, and this is going live tomorrow. Not our fault). I've looked around for a simple tutorial of implementing this. Unfortunately i cannot even find a tutorial where they have both the salt and key separately. Basically all i have really right now is a small function that takes in an array of BYTE. Along with its length. How can i do this?
I've spent most of the morning trying to make heads/tails of the cryptoAPI. But its not going well period :(
EDIT
So i asked for how they encrypt it. They use C#, and use RijndaelManaged, which from my knowledge is not equivalent to AES. 
EDIT2
Okay finally got exactly what was going on, and they sent us the wrong keys.
They are doing the following:
Padding = PKCS7
CipherMode = CBC
The Key is defined as a set of 32 Bytes in hex.
The IV is defined as a set of 32 bytes in hex too.
They took away the salt when i asked them.
How hard is it to set these things in CryptoAPI using the wincrypt.h header file.?
","AES-256 uses 256 bit keys. Ideally, each key in your system should be equally likely. A 63 byte string would be 504 bits. You first need to figure out how the string of 63 characters needs to be converted to 256 bits (The sample ones you gave are not base64 encoded). Next, ""salt"" isn't an intrinsic part of AES. You might be referring to either an initialization vector (IV) in Cipher-Block-Chaining mode or you could be referring to somehow updating the key. 
If I were to guess, I'm assuming that by ""SALT"" you mean IV and specifically CBC mode. 
You will need to know all of this when using CAPI functions (e.g. decrypt).
If all of this sounds confusing, then it might be best to change your design so that you don't have to worry about getting all of this right. Crypto is hard. One bad step could invalidate all the security. Consider looking at this comment on my Stick Figure Guide to AES.
UPDATE: You can look at this for a rough starting point for C++ CAPI. You'll need a 64 character hex string to get 256 bits ( 256 bits / (4 bits / char) == 64 chars). You can convert the chars to bits yourself. 
Again, I must caution that playing fast and loose with IV's and keys can have disastrous consequences. I've studied AES/Rijndael in depth down to the math and gate level and have even written my own implementation. However, in my production code, I stick to using a well-tested TLS implementation if at all possible for data in transit. Even for data at rest, it'd be better to use a higher level library.

Now we basically were sent the AES Key along with the SALT they are using so we can modify our unpackager. 
NOTE THESE ARE NOT THE KEYS JUST AN EXAMPLE:
They are each 63 byte long ASCII characters:
Key: ""QS;x||COdn'YQ@vs-`X\/xf}6T7Fe)[qnr^U*HkLv(yF~n~E23DwA5^#-YK|]v.""
Salt: ""|$-3C]IWo%g6,!K~FvL0Fy`1s&N<|1fg24Eg#{)lO=o;xXY6o%ux42AvB][j#/&""

We basically want to use the C++ CryptoAPI to decrypt this(I also am the only programmer here this week, and this is going live tomorrow. Not our fault). I've looked around for a simple tutorial of implementing this. Unfortunately i cannot even find a tutorial where they have both the salt and key separately. Basically all i have really right now is a small function that takes in an array of BYTE. Along with its length. How can i do this?
I've spent most of the morning trying to make heads/tails of the cryptoAPI. But its not going well period :(
EDIT
So i asked for how they encrypt it. They use C#, and use RijndaelManaged, which from my knowledge is not equivalent to AES. 
EDIT2
Okay finally got exactly what was going on, and they sent us the wrong keys.
They are doing the following:
Padding = PKCS7
CipherMode = CBC
The Key is defined as a set of 32 Bytes in hex.
The IV is defined as a set of 32 bytes in hex too.
They took away the salt when i asked them.
How hard is it to set these things in CryptoAPI using the wincrypt.h header file.?

"18761993","Steps to include timestamp in PDF signature","Good day,
I'm trying to embedded timestamp information into a pdf signature so that adobe will report to me that the signature was timestamp. Currently, all I've achieved is that Adobe reports that ""The signature includes an embedded timestamp but it could not be verified"" and when you view the Date/Time properties it says that the ""Timestamp Authority"" s not available and the ""Show Certificate"" is greyed out.
Obviously, I am doing something wrong in constructing my PKCS#7 message. But I don't now what.
Can someone please help me by describing the steps I need to take so that my signature will be timestamped? Or suggest a tool that can help me find the problem?
I'm using Crypto API. The steps I follow currently is as follows:

Create a digest of the pdf data using the CryptHashMessage function (SHA256).
Send this digest to the TSA using the CryptRetrieveTimeStamp function. I've set the *TIMESTAMP_DONT_HASH_DATA* flag so that the digest won't be hashed again.
The repsonse from the TSA is added to a *CRYPT_SIGN_MESSAGE_PARA* structure as an unauthenticated attribute and the signing time is added as an authenticated attribute.
Then I use the CryptSignMessage function to sign the original data which uses the above structure.

How can I check that the data is correct so that adobe can show me that the signature has been timestamped?

","In a nutshell: You are time stamping the wrong data, see the bottom of the answer.
Major differences between your signature and Adobe's signature:

Adobe's signature contains a signed revocation information attribute; this attribute does not contains any actual revocation information. 
As this attribute is optional, it should not be relevant here.
Your signature contains a signed signing time attribute. 
As you also have a time stamp embedded, a signing time is not necessary but it is not forbidden, either.
Your signature has a signatureAlgorithm value of 1.2.840.113549.1.1.1, i.e. RSA encryption while Adobe's is 1.2.840.113549.1.1.11, i.e. sha256WithRSAEncryption
Here Adobe's choice definitively is the better one but Adobe Reader seems to ignore the deficiency in your signature: After all, it says that the document had not been changed since signing.
In your signature the time stamp stamps the hash of the PDF document, i.e. the same as in the signature's signed messageDigest attribute while in Adobe's signature the time stamp stamps a different one.
BANG. This is the problem. Admittedly you'd said it in your original question but it didn't catch my eye:

Create a digest of the pdf data using the CryptHashMessage function (SHA256).
Send this digest to the TSA using the CryptRetrieveTimeStamp function. I've set the *TIMESTAMP_DONT_HASH_DATA* flag so that the digest won't be hashed again.

This is wrong! The time stamp is added as an unsigned attribute, according to spec:

Time stamp information as an unsigned attribute (PDF 1.6): The timestamp token shall conform to RFC 3161 and shall be computed and embedded into the PKCS#7 object as described in Appendix A of RFC 3161.
(section 12.8.3.3.1 of ISO 32000-1)

And RFC 3161 states:

The value of messageImprint field within TimeStampToken shall be a hash of the value of signature field within SignerInfo for the signedData being time-stamped.
(Appendix A of RFC 3161)

Thus, you are time stamping the wrong hash! Adobe correctly expects you to time stamp the signature. So you should first create a regular signature, then look up its signature value, hash & time stamp that value, and then add that time stamp to the signature container signer info as unsigned time stamp attribute.
Unfortunately I don't know the Windows Crypto API well enough to explain how to do that; I'm more at home in the Java crypto api.

        if (s.Read(rawLength, 0, rawLength.Length) != rawLength.Length)
            throw new SystemException(""Stream did not contain properly formatted byte array"");

        byte[] buffer = new byte[BitConverter.ToInt32(rawLength, 0)];
        if (s.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length) != buffer.Length)
            throw new SystemException(""Did not read byte array properly"");

        return buffer;
    }
}

Here is some test usage code I wrote:
        FileStream fs = new FileStream(""c:\\temp\\test.dat"", FileMode.Create, FileAccess.ReadWrite, FileShare.None);
        Stream cs = Crypto.CreateCryptoStreamAESWrite(""test"", fs);
        BinaryWriter bw = new BinaryWriter(cs);
        bw.Write(""test"");
        cs.Flush();
        fs.Close();
        fs = new FileStream(""c:\\temp\\test.dat"", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.ReadWrite);
        cs = Crypto.CreateCryptoStreamAESRead(""test"", fs);
        BinaryReader br = new BinaryReader(cs);
        string test = br.ReadString();
        if (test != ""test"")
            throw new Exception(""Your Kungfu is not good!"");
        fs.Close();

This is the error I get on the br.ReadString() line:
System.IndexOutOfRangeException: Index was outside the bounds of the array.

   at System.IO.BinaryReader.ReadByte()

","Looks like I needed to call Close on my Crypto stream.  I was calling Flush, but not Close.  I replaced cs.Flush() with cs.Close() and now it is working.
Hopefully someone can at least learn from the example code in my question, although I imagine there is an easier way to just read/write AES encrypted streams (to/from file or otherwise).

","Could it be that the CSP you use aren't installed on your Win2003? I remember reading that XP before SP3 had some problems with SHA-2 or something, and XP and Win2003 are more or less the same basic OS I think.
I think you can see what's installed on the following registry key
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\Defaults
Maybe you can compare between your machines.

","Can you give more information about your environment. First of all: which Service Pack has Windows 2003 Server. There is for example a bug ""Default Diffie-Hellman SChannel Certificate Selection on Web Enrollment Page Causes Error: 0x80090008 - NTE_BAD_ALGID"" which are fixed in SP3 http://support.microsoft.com/kb/324953/en. If it is not your problem, you should place the certificate and a binary file with the test message somewhere on web and post URL here. Then one will be able to reproduce and test the problem.
I suppose, to fix your problem (if the last Service Pack is installed on the Windows Server 2003) one will be have to change some properties of the certificate with which the message are signed.
I don't think, by the way that you certificate use SHA-2 algorithms (SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512). If you do use this one and have the last Service pack installed, then it can be needed to use explicitly ""Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider""  (or ""Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider (Prototype)"" as it's called on Windows XP SP3) or PROV_RSA_AES or MS_ENH_RSA_AES_PROV instead of default PROV_RSA_FULL provider. (see, for example, http://blogs.msdn.com/alejacma/archive/2009/01/23/sha-2-support-on-windows-xp.aspx)
Updated 1:
After receiving your test file the problem is more clear. First of all a good news. Your program works correct! It works without any problem on my test Windows 2003 server with SP2. So we have administrative problem and not a software development. I recommend you to test the program on another Windows 2003 Server. On this server you can reinstall SP2 and then go to Microsoft Updates and install all updates.
By the way you have no problems with SHA256 or other SHA-2 algorithms. You use in your example a standard 1.2.840.113549.1.1.5 sha1RSA algorithm.
Now about your program. I read detailed your code and understand exactly what you do. You receive an PKCS#7 signed message which contain a text tile (an XML file) inside. How I understand your example come from http://blogs.msdn.com/alejacma/archive/2010/04/09/how-to-call-cryptmsg-api-in-streaming-mode-c.aspx which describes problem with decrypting of files larger as 100MB (see also http://blogs.msdn.com/alejacma/archive/2010/03/17/asn1-value-too-large-error-when-calling-signedcms-computesignature.aspx). If you not have this case, I recommend you to use .NET cryptographic functions from System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs namespace. If you do have large data, you current code is OK. The only something suspected place is reading of input file. I don't read stream.ReadBytes() call. I would be use better memory mapped files instead of loading a huge file in memory. To do this in native code you can use code like following
DWORD MapFileInMemory (IN LPCWSTR pszFileName,
                       OUT PBYTE *ppbyFile, OUT PDWORD pdwFileSizeLow, OUT PDWORD pdwFileSizeHigh)
{
    HANDLE hFile = INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE, hFileMapping = NULL;
    DWORD  dwStatus = (DWORD)E_UNEXPECTED;

    __try {
        // Open the input file to be encrypted or decrypted
        hFile = CreateFileW (pszFileName, FILE_READ_DATA, FILE_SHARE_READ, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING,
                             FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL | FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN, NULL);
        if (hFile == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
            dwStatus = GetLastError();
            __leave;
        }

        *pdwFileSizeLow = GetFileSize (hFile, pdwFileSizeHigh);
        if (*pdwFileSizeLow == INVALID_FILE_SIZE){
            dwStatus = GetLastError();
            __leave;
        }

        hFileMapping = CreateFileMapping (hFile, NULL, PAGE_READONLY, 0, 0, NULL);
        if (!hFileMapping){
            dwStatus = GetLastError();
            __leave;
        }

        *ppbyFile = (PBYTE) MapViewOfFile (hFileMapping, FILE_MAP_READ, 0, 0, 0);
        if (*ppbyFile == NULL) {
            dwStatus = GetLastError();
            __leave;
        }

        dwStatus = NO_ERROR;
    }
    __finally {
        if (hFileMapping)
            CloseHandle (hFileMapping);

        if (hFile != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)
            CloseHandle (hFile);
    }

    return dwStatus;
}

BOOL UnmapFileFromMemory (LPCVOID lpBaseAddress)
{
    return UnmapViewOfFile (lpBaseAddress);
}

Writing of the corresponding .NET code would be not a problem. Using Memory Mapped Files create only a virtual address mapping to the file, data will be read only if you access to the corresponding part of data.
One more remark. The part of you code, where you verify the message is not full. What you have to do is the verifying of the certificate with which the message signed. If you use native CryptoAPI, you can do this with respect of CertGetCertificateChain(). Only then you will be sure, that the certificate and all it's parent are valid. You should also verify with respect of CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy() that the certificate chain allow usage of the certificate for signing of messages.
Current code by the way works without error messages, but the Issuer of the certificate with which the message are signed is ""CN=PostSignum Qualified CA, O=""Ceská pošta, s.p. [IC 47114983]"", C=CZ"" and inside your message the certificated is not exist. You can use for example certutil.exe -dump 31602.zfo to see details:
Missing Issuer: CN=PostSignum Qualified CA, O=""Ceská pošta, s.p. [IC 47114983]"", C=CZ

A certificate chain could not be built to a trusted root authority. 0x800b010a (-2146762486)

Probably you don't want interpret any signed message as valid. Verification of the certificate is mandatory. Moreover in a lot of scenarios it would be good to define the range of origins from which Issuer you want to allow a signed messages as an input. Think about this.
Updated 2: You are right in new 331879.zfo file you really use sha256RSA (1.2.840.113549.1.1.11) for signature. Try to install http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968730/en which I fond on
http://thehotfixshare.net/board/index.php?showtopic=12629&hl=968730.
It is a digitally signed file. So I it must be safe. To be absolutely sure you can receive this fix from Microsoft. I hope this fix will solve you problem.
Updated 3: I thought a little more about your code example. It seems to me, that to receive the best implementation you should implement the whole code of the message decoding as unmanaged (native) code. So you will not spend any additional time for marshaling between native and managed code during decoding of large data. This native code you should place inside a DLL and export a function which you can use inside you main managed code.
One more remark about using memory mapped filed. Usage of memory mapped filed is mostly optimized way access any file in Windows for both reading and writing. One thing which you must to know is memory usage. If you look at Task Manager for used memory you can see that a program used memory mapped file technique can use very large memory. It is not a problem at all. This memory is not a physical memory and not a paged memory from the paging file. A virtual addressed will be mapped directly to the file which you mapped in memory. So paging of data will be done with respect of the file data itself. No additional parts of the paging file of operation system are needed. This I/O from the file is much optimized and implemented with respect of corresponding embedded processor features.
End solution: Because I could not stop thinking about this problem I had to solve it. Here is the solution which full based on what I already written before.

You install the patch KB968730 (see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968730/en) on the Windows Server with Service Pack 2. The patch can be downloaded from http://thehotfixshare.net/board/index.php?showtopic=12629&hl=968730.

Now the program works with data signed with SHA-2 algorithms (like 331879.zfo signed with 1.2.840.113549.1.1.11 sha256RSA)
I recommend you don't forget about memory mapped files. If you use .NET 4.0 you can use new .NET framework classes (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd997372%28v=VS.100%29.aspx).

This is working fine on my Win 7 dev machine, but on a Windows 2003 server production machine it fails with the following exception:

","I don't have any experience with Luna but this worked well for nCiper HSM:
certutil -repairstore -csp ""nCipher Enhanced Cryptographic Provider"" My <serial number of certificate>

where ""nCipher Enhanced Cryptographic Provider"" is the name of CSP that comes with HSM.
Serial number of certificate can be obtained using this command:
certutil -store My

It will print all certificates in Local_Machine\My store. The serial number will be between bunch of ====== like ================ Certificate 5 ================. It will also parse information about the certificates like serial number, subject etc. and it will run encrypt/decrypt test to verify usability of the certificate.
After you repair the binding you can use this (second) command to verify that it went well. Don't be fooled by output of the first command, I have never seen it put out anything other than success.
You can find more information about usage of certutil here.

BufferedImage img2 = new BufferedImage(bytes1.length, 1,BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);


//put bytes into pixels as int
int count=0;

img1.setRGB(0, count, (int)b);
count++;}

count=0;

then get the two images pixels parse the rgb value back into byte and and reverse your separation process, to decode.

"21645022","Signing a document using MS cryptoAPI with Delphi","I have tried to find some complete examples in Delphi of how to sign a piece of data using the Microsoft CryptoAPI. Online I find mostly snippets and pseudo-code, but no concrete examples of how to do this.
From what I understand, having spent a day hunting for code and info, you can create a hash of a document/file based on a public key (either if you self-generate a pair, or provided by a certificate on the keychain). This hash is then encoded into the encrypted output file (container section) and can be verified and decoded by the receiver holding the private key.
If a Delphi example doesnt exist, are there any free commanline programs I can use to sign a file/document?
I have found code for MD5/SHA1 hashing and also one that encrypts a file using a password string (deriving a hash from a keypar generated on the fly). But sadly no signing of a stream or a file.
The closest match on google is an older product by Turbopower (LockBox) but I have no idea if the generated output is compatible with MS cryptoAPI (?)
Update: This is something along the lines of what I am looking for, but written in C:
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/alejacma/archive/2008/01/23/how-to-sign-and-verify-with-cryptoapi-and-a-user-certificate.aspx
Also, when you downgrade a question - be good enough to describe why you do so. It is a perfectly valid question for Delphi regarding something you face in larger, corporate applications.
","I know it's bad form to actually answere your own question, but since there seem to be little ""hands on"" examples for this under Delphi, I decided to post what I found here to help others.
Security, certificates and signatures is a massive and complex topic which requires serious study, so forgive me for the simplicity of this post. It is only meant to point people in the right direction.
Signing XML, what does it mean?
In very simple, hands-on terms this is what happens:

You generate a HASH of your XML document (MD5 for instance, or
SHA1)
You encrypt this HASH using the private key, either generated
by yourself or provided/derived by your certificate
A new XML node (DSIG signature) is inserted into the document which contains the encrypted hash (and more)

In order to verify that an XML document has not been tampered with, the reader must use the public key to decode the HASH value. So the reader-software must generate a hash of the same document (minus the appended XML) and compare that to the (decrypted) value embedded in the document. If these match, then we know the document is intact. And it will only match if you use a valid key to decrypt the appended hash.
Since this is tedious work (and it includes quite a few steps, like looking up providers in the keystore [in my case] and much, much more) I ended up buying ready-made VCL components from ELDOS (SecureBlackBox) which saved me a lot of time.

"4926276","CryptoAPI: Using CryptVerifySignature to verify a signature from openssl with public key","I am trying to port the AquaticPrime framework for Mac to Windows.
On the Mac, it uses the opensll library, and I try to understand how to port this to Windows, where I have to use the CryptoAPI, I guess.
I mainly need the code for validation of the generated signature with a given public key.
Here's how verification is done with openssl:

inputs: license data, public key and signature, both 128 bytes long.
A SHA1 digest is calculated from the license data.
A RSA context is set up with the public key data
RSA_public_decrypt() is called, given the RSA key and the signature, which returns a 20 byte long SHA1 digest - is this digest equal the one from step 2, the signature is valid.

So, how do I do this with CryptoAPI? I've gotten this far:

Start with CryptAcquireContext(ctx, 0, 0, PROV_RSA_FULL, CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT)
Use CryptImportKey with the help of this posting, with pubexp=3 and bitlen=1024. That all works, i.e. I get no errors, and I looked at the binary data to verify that it matches what the MSDN article shows.
Create a SHA1 digest from the license data. I've retrieved the resulting 20 byte hash value and see that it matches what I get with openssl on the Mac.

At this point, I call:
CryptVerifySignature (hashHdl, sig, sigLen, keyHdl, 0, 0)

This fails with error code ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.
The odd thing is that when I first accidentally had stored a twice as large public key into the PUBLICKEYBLOB structure, I received a NTE_BAD_SIGNATURE error instead. This might suggest that now the public key I am passing is correct.
Why the ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER error now, then? I've verified that the hash value is correct, and the key appears to be accepted, too. And the ""sig"" parameter is just a pointer to the 128 bytes of the signature, and sigLen is 128.
So, what am I missing here?

RSA_public_decrypt() is called, given the RSA key and the signature, which returns a 20 byte long SHA1 digest - is this digest equal the one from step 2, the signature is valid.

So, how do I do this with CryptoAPI? I've gotten this far:

Start with CryptAcquireContext(ctx, 0, 0, PROV_RSA_FULL, CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT)
Use CryptImportKey with the help of this posting, with pubexp=3 and bitlen=1024. That all works, i.e. I get no errors, and I looked at the binary data to verify that it matches what the MSDN article shows.
Create a SHA1 digest from the license data. I've retrieved the resulting 20 byte hash value and see that it matches what I get with openssl on the Mac.

At this point, I call:
CryptVerifySignature (hashHdl, sig, sigLen, keyHdl, 0, 0)

This fails with error code ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.
The odd thing is that when I first accidentally had stored a twice as large public key into the PUBLICKEYBLOB structure, I received a NTE_BAD_SIGNATURE error instead. This might suggest that now the public key I am passing is correct.
Why the ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER error now, then? I've verified that the hash value is correct, and the key appears to be accepted, too. And the ""sig"" parameter is just a pointer to the 128 bytes of the signature, and sigLen is 128.
So, what am I missing here?
","OK, I solved the problem after lots of trial-and-error.
Both the signature and the public key data, when in their pure byte string form, need to be reversed, i.e. first byte to last position, and so on.
Then the above works.

This class is only useful for raw secret keys that can be represented as a byte array and have no key parameters associated with them, e.g., DES or Triple DES keys.

How can I delete those keys and import new one using C#?
","I've come across the same problem and have seen similiar posts on the web but finally I've found the answer... by checking the error code! 
The reason is that pcbData's value is changed by the implementation being called (to reflect length of the returned data) and must be set to buffer's size before each call.
Checking GetLastError after the failure shows error 234 which is exactly that!
Actually it seems to be a propagation of a bug in code sample from ""Extending .NET Cryptography with CAPICOM and P/Invoke"" (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms867087.aspx)
dwFlags=CRYPT_FIRST;  //required initalization

In other words, it looks like you can't instantiate a hash context in any way other than empty (and then by having it hash your input data).
How do you have the hash at present - a byte array? If so you probably just want to sign that array; I'd look into CryptSignMessage or CryptSignMessageWithKey as likely to do the job.

"693974","Crypto API <-> .NET RSA interoperability","I have a unmanaged application that is generates an RC4 encryption key using Crypto API. This unmanaged application encrypts some data using this RC4 key. There is also a client side unmanaged application that uses this RC4 key to decrypt information. 
However, for this client app we're sending a session key -> the RC4 key encrytped using an RSA public key that was generated at the client side(SIMPLEBLOB). The generation of the encrypted session key used to be done using unmanaged code but now that has to be converted to C# because there is a requirement to run this code from a web application under partial trust.
Key is generated using
CryptGenKey(hProv, CALG_RC4, KEY_LENGTH | CRYPT_EXPORTABLE, &hKey);

It is exported into the file system using
CryptExportKey(hKey, 0, OPAQUEKEYBLOB, 0, lpBuffer, &nSize);

(note I was able to export the the plain text key using this article 
http://www.codeproject.com/KB/security/plaintextsessionkey.aspx)
Client public key is created using 
CryptGetUserKey(hProv, AT_KEYEXCHANGE, &hKeyPair);

Client public key is exported using
CryptExportKey(hKeyPair, 0, PUBLICKEYBLOB, 0, lpData, &nSize);

Session Key is created at the server side using

client public key is imported using 
CryptImportKey(hProv, lpData, nSize, NULL, 0, &hPublicKey
Session Key is generated by encryting the RC4 using the client public key to generate a SIMPLEBLOB format
CryptExportKey(hKey, hPublicKey, SIMPLEBLOB, 0, lpData, &nSize);

Now my requirement is to have the above steps (step 1 & 2) in a managed version and here is what i am doing :
//Read the plain text key data that was extracted using the code project article
    byte[] keyMaterial = File.ReadAllBytes(@""C:\keyMaterial.txt""); 
// Import the client public key
CspParameters cspParams = new CspParameters();
            cspParams.KeyContainerName = ""Container Name"";
            cspParams.KeyNumber = (int)KeyNumber.Exchange;
            cspParams.ProviderType = 1;
            cspParams.ProviderName = ""Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0"";
            cspParams.Flags = CspProviderFlags.UseMachineKeyStore;

            RSACryptoServiceProvider rsaClient = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(cspParams);   
            rsaClient.ImportCspBlob(File.ReadAllBytes(@""C:\client.key""));

//Generate a SIMPLEBLOB session key
byte[] session = GetRC4SessionBlobFromKey(keyMaterial, rsaClient);



//Encrypt a key using public key and write it in a SIMPLEBLOB format
public byte[] GetRC4SessionBlobFromKey(byte[] keyData, RSACryptoServiceProvider publicKey)
        {  
            using(MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream())  
            using(BinaryWriter w = new BinaryWriter(ms))
            {   
                w.Write((byte) 0x01); // SIMPLEBLOB    
                w.Write((byte) 0x02); // Version 2    
                w.Write((byte) 0x00); // Reserved    
                w.Write((byte) 0x00); // Reserved    
                w.Write(0x00006801);  // ALG_ID = RC4 for the encrypted key.
                w.Write(0x0000a400);  // CALG_RSA_KEYX    

                w.Write(publicKey.Encrypt(keyData, false));
                w.Flush();

                return ms.ToArray();  
            }
        }

This generates the same size of data as its unmanaged version but it doesn't generate the correct SIMPLEBLOB session key as when diong step 1 and 2 of the unmanaged version. What am I doing wrong in this code?
","I'm a novice here but I just read in MSDN docs the following:
Interoperation with the Microsoft Cryptographic API (CAPI)
Unlike the RSA implementation in unmanaged CAPI, the RSACryptoServiceProvider class reverses the order of an encrypted array of bytes after encryption and before decryption. By default, data encrypted by the RSACryptoServiceProvider class cannot be decrypted by the CAPI CryptDecrypt function and data encrypted by the CAPI CryptEncrypt method cannot be decrypted by the RSACryptoServiceProvider class.
If you do not compensate for the reverse ordering when interoperating between APIs, the RSACryptoServiceProvider class throws a CryptographicException.
Could this be the problem?

From that I conclude that if it is a user's store, it uses the user's password (or probably the user's hashed password) to encrypt the private key, and, if it is the local machine store, it is probably some kind of hardware-based key to encrypt the private key.
Did I get it right???
And if I did, what is the point of non-exportable keys if I can decrypt the keys???
And last question - If I got it right up to here, what are the alternatives?
","As ""SLanks"" link explains, the private keys are encrypted with the user's password or the machines's password (depends on the location of the keys in the store).
Therefore, anyone who can log to the machine can obtain to this user's keys and anyone who has access to the machine can obtain keys stored for the local machine.

Thank you
","I found out how to do this thanks to these two threads:
How to get KeyStore from usb token in Java
java keytool with opensc pkcs#11 provider only works with debug option enabled
And this website:
Pdf Signing Using eToken in java
First, if the website has a certificate java doesn't trust by default you have to create a trustStore and load it to java's System properties. you can see how to do it in here:
Oracle - Generating a KeyStore and TrustStore (using keytool)
Than you have to find where the PKCS#11 library used for your smartCard/eToken is installed in your computer, in mine it is in ""C:\Windows\System32\eTPKCS11.dll"". Then create a .cfg file like this:
name=SafeNet
library=C:\Windows\System32\eTPKCS11.dll
slot=4

Where you give it a name and the path to your PKCS#11 library. Slot is the slot where your eToken/SmartCard is connected (you don't need to set this if you don't want).
Now my code looks like this:
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStore"", ""cfgFiles/trustedHttpsCertificates.truestore"");
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType"", ""jks"");
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword"", ""oiadad"");

Provider newProvider = new SunPKCS11(""cfgFiles/etpkcs11.cfg"");
Security.addProvider(newProvider);

try {
    KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS11"");
    keyStore.load(null, """".toCharArray());

    KeyManagerFactory keyFactory = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance(KeyManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
    keyFactory.init(keyStore,null);

    SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance(""SSL"", ""SunJSSE"");
    sslContext.init(keyFactory.getKeyManagers(), null, null);
    sslSocketFactory = sslContext.getSocketFactory();

} catch (KeyStoreException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (CertificateException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (NoSuchProviderException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (UnrecoverableKeyException e1) {
    e1.printStackTrace();
} catch (KeyManagementException e1) {
    e1.printStackTrace();
}

I first tell java where to look for my trustStore. Then I pass the path to my cfg file, create a provider with it and tell security that this new provider exists.
After this I initialize and load a PKCS11 KeyStore giving it a blank password (could pass my real password if I wanted, but this way a SafeNet pop window shows up and asks me for my password).
Then I instantiate a KeyManagerFactory and a SSLSocketFactory. This is the last step to using your eToken to be able to access multi-factor authentication https urls.
Now there's just one more trick to access a protected https website, you have to give the HttpsURLConnection the new SSLSocketFactory. You can do it like this:
try {
    HttpsURLConnection conn = (HttpsURLConnection)new URL(<your-https-url-here>).openConnection();
    conn.setRequestMethod(""GET"");
    conn.setDoInput(true);
    conn.setSSLSocketFactory(sslSocketFactory);

    int responseCode = conn.getResponseCode();
    System.out.println(""RESPONSE: "" + responseCode);

    InputStream inputstream = conn.getInputStream();
    InputStreamReader inputstreamreader = new InputStreamReader(inputstream);
    BufferedReader bufferedreader = new BufferedReader(inputstreamreader);

    String line = null;
    String htmlResponse = """";

    while ((line = bufferedreader.readLine()) != null) {
        htmlResponse += line + ""\n"";
        //System.out.println(""html: "" + line);
    }
} catch (ProtocolException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (MalformedURLException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

I hope this helps anyone having problems with eTokens or SmartCards.

","Windows respects the process ACL, and by default, this allows access to the user the process is running as as well as to the local system account and the user's logon session SID.  Administrators can bypass this ACL using SeDebugPrivilege.
Otherwise, you would need to be an administrator in order to debug your own code.
You can change the process ACL, but since normally (IIRC) the current user is the process owner I'm not certain whether or not you can prevent another process in the current user context from changing it back.

","You don't describe the exact scenario in which you need to use code injection. If ope process running without administrative rights create another process with respect of CreateProcess for example one get handle on the new process with all rights PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS (hProcess of PROCESS_INFORMATION).

The handle returned by the CreateProcess function has
  PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS access to the process object.

So one should just hold the handler returned from CreateProcess and don't close it till you need to have full access to the child process. In the way you will have PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD, PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION, PROCESS_VM_OPERATION, PROCESS_VM_WRITE, and PROCESS_VM_READ access rights required to call CreateRemoteThread and WriteProcessMemory.

","I don't think a self-signed certificate is what you need here.  You want to create a new ""client"" certificate that is signed by your ""root"" certificate, correct?  I think you need to use CryptSignAndEncodeCertificate to do this.

","First of all some years ago I wrote some product which contain also the full code what you asked for: creating of a new certificate and signing it with respect of other root certificate. This code use only Microsoft CryptoAPI. But before I give you detailed answer or post some code I want to know, whether your problem is actual: your question is one and half months old.
In general to do what you want, one should not use CertCreateSelfSignCertificate() function, but create a certificate with respect of other CryptoAPIs. CertCreateSelfSignCertificate() function can only be used to create and to sign a self-signed certificate. It can not sign a certificate with other certificate which you created. Moreover CertCreateSelfSignCertificate() function have (or at least had some years before) a hard restriction to the length of created private key. Thus one have to make the same things which CertCreateSelfSignCertificate() function do manually. The last API in the chain of API what one do is CryptSignAndEncodeCertificate() like wrote in another answer Luke on your question.
Moreover I have a large suspect, that for your purpose creating a certificate chain is not correct way. If you need to do this only for authentication, you don't need create a certificate on the client side. It seems to me, that it will be enough working with singed messages. One use certificates instead of key pair is cases where you need features like key revocation or key restriction for usage for some purpose only (for example only for code signing and not for data encryption).
If you really needs implement certificated based authentication, then at least you have to create a certificate of the client computer, send it to the server computer and sing client certificate on the server computer, because only server computer could hold a private key of root certificate.
It can be also that you can implement your requirement with respect of the Certificate Enrollment API? It will be not exactly what you asked for, but it can solve your main problem.
Answer on additional questions (comments):
Either I don't understand the construct which you plan to realize as ""2 way authentication"" or the concept is wrong.

I don't understand how and when you plan transport root client certificate from all clients to server. 
You want to sign client certificate with clients root CA, so you have to hold on the client the private key of the client's root CA certificate (!!!???).
If server don't have any verified information about the client like its root CA certificate, than you can not really use client certificate for client's authorization. Any client with a certificate will be ""authorized"".
With the standard SSL without client certificate you can be sure that you communicate all the time with the same client. So if you don't solve the problem of clients root CA transport to the server you will be not able to achieve more security as in the standard (without client certificate) SSL.
What you wrote seems like you try not to use a standard communication protocol between server and client. Instead of that you try to introduce a new own protocol. It is VERY dangerous! If you not a cryptography expert, you will realize a protocol which only looks like safe and not be so. ""SMALL"" problems like holding of private key and safe transport of public key from client to server or back are very important cryptographic subjects. There are different cryptographic protocols to solve there. So don't try to implement something new in this area!
Think one more about why you really want use client certificate. Are you really implement client authentication with the way? In standard SSL, for example, one can be sure that one communicate all time with the same client and use for this only a random nonces and a symmetric key generated for the session. Do you want generate a certificate per client or per session?

I can write more my questions. If you implement his own certificate based communication protocol I have large problems to give my recommendation before I understand you concept.

And obviously it fail.
I think I didn't generate the signature value correctly.
","I got it work finally.  It was the endian problem at last.  Microsoft CryptoAPI present modulus and signature value in Little Endian bit string.  While the XMLDSIG specification presents in Big Endian bit string.
After obtaining modulus and signature value from CryptoAPI functions, just convert it to Big Endian bit string by reversing the bytes orders:
function Reverse(A: TBytes): TBytes;
var B: Byte;
    i: integer;
begin
  SetLength(Result, Length(A));
  i := Length(A) - 1;
  for B in A do begin
    Result[i] := B;
    Dec(i);
  end;
end;

Print(ToBase64(reverse(bSign)));
Print(ToBase64(reverse(bPubKeyModulus)));

"12120862","Extracting modulus and exponent from public key using Openssl and C++","So I'm currently studying how networking works. I've got a bunch of packets from wireshark which I have already copied in buffers(only the content, without header. Wireshark->Follow TPC Stream->C arrays). I can understand the protocol but in the 3rd packet it requires a key exchange. After some googling I found that I need RSA encryption. It sends me a public key + token. And I shoud return encrypted shared key(just generated) and encrypted token which I received earlier. 
RSA_key needs exponent and modulus, So my question is: How can I create RSA_key object from single char[] buffer(the public key).
NOTE:I'm posting here after long time googling. I may not be using the right keywords because I'm not english speaker. I could find threads asking this with php only.

Ohh I forgot, first column is the byte position, second column is the byte value typecasted to int, 3th column is again value but (int)(unsigned char) so I can see if its +127, 4th colums is the hex representation of the value and the last column is character based on ascii table(if its visible character).

Exactly that i want to archieve with Delphi using CryptoAPI (JwaWinCrypt.pas)
I've tried following code:
procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
var
  hStore: HCERTSTORE;
  CertContext: PCertContext;
  pszString: PAnsiChar;
  pchString: Cardinal;

      CertContext := CertEnumCertificatesInStore(hStore, CertContext);
    end;
  finally
    CertCloseStore(hStore, 0);
  end;
end;

Problem is that ShowMessage shows nothing, the string is empty.
Has someone an idea what i do wrong?
","The documentation for CryptBinaryToString says this about the pszString parameter.

A pointer to a buffer that receives the converted string. To calculate the number of characters that must be allocated to hold the returned string, set this parameter to NULL. The function will place the required number of characters, including the terminating NULL character, in the value pointed to by pcchString.

You are obliged to allocate the buffer so that the API function can populate it. You are failing to do so. In order to proceed you must read the documentation carefully and abide by the requirements of the API.
So you need to call the function like this:
szString: AnsiString;
....
chString := 0;
CryptBinaryToString(CertContext.pbCertEncoded, CertContext.cbCertEncoded,  
    CRYPT_STRING_BASE64, nil, chString);
SetLength(szString, chString-1);
CryptBinaryToString(CertContext.pbCertEncoded, CertContext.cbCertEncoded,  
    CRYPT_STRING_BASE64, PAnsiChar(szString), chString);

You should also check the return value of CryptBinaryToString to detect failures. I omitted that for brevity.
I'm also assuming that yours is an ANSI Delphi. I assumed that because you used PAnsiChar.

","I know it's 4 years after question was asked, but I get this page many times when I was looking for this issue solution - so perhaps I'm not the only person and my answer will help somebody ;)
I found information, that serial number is reversed in struct _CERT_INFO, so bytes from certInfo.SerialNumber.pbData should be reversed. Moreover, you should take only certInfo.SerialNumber.cbData bytes (cbData is length of serial number). It's important, because when I was trying to use whole pbData, I was getting many rubbish bytes. 
When I have reversed bytes, I convert them to hex. And thats all ;)
My code:
unsigned char* pbData = pCertContext->pCertInfo->SerialNumber.pbData;
int cbData = pCertContext->pCertInfo->SerialNumber.cbData;

std::string serial((char*)pbData);
std::string serialSubstring = serial.substr(0,cbData);
std::reverse(serialSubstring.begin(), serialSubstring.end());
String snInHex(string_to_hex(serialSubstring).c_str());
//now snInHex contains serial number in hexadecimal string

Extra feature - serial number as number! When you need serial number as data (for example, to create xades file):
unsigned int sNumber;
std::stringstream ss;
ss << std::hex << snInHex.c_str();
ss >> sNumber;
//now serial number is stored as number in sNumber

Edit
string_to_hec function was taken from here: C++ convert string to hexadecimal and vice versa

which appears to conform to the X.509 specs (as I would expect it to):
Certificate ::= {
   tbsCertificate TBSCertificate,
   signatureAlgorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
   signatureValue BIT STRING
}

TBSCertificate ::= SEQUENCE {   
   version [0] Version DEFAULT v1,  <-- what does this mean?
   serialNumber INTEGER,
   signature AlgorithmIdentifier,
   issuer Name,
   validity Validity,
   subjectName Name,
   subjectPublicKeyInfo SubjectPublicKeyInfo
   ...
}

with the lone exception of the version part, which isn't clear to me whether it is optional or not (though it never seems to be added with certificates I create with OpenSSL).
I can open the certificate to import into a certificate store (and can successfully import to a store), so I don't think anything is specifically wrong with the file/encoding.
When I reach the call to CertCreateCertificateContext, my lp buffer looks like:
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIBqzCCARQCCQDUJyWk0OxlRTANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQUFADAaMRgwFgYDVQQDDA9N\neSBTaWduaW5nIENlcnQwHhcNMTYwMTA1MjIzODU5WhcNMTcwMTA0MjIzODU5WjAa\nMRgwFgYDVQQDDA9NeSBTaWduaW5nIENlcnQwgZ8wDQ...

and bytes = 639 -- which is the file size.
I've tried adding logic to strip out the certificate comments, but examples of importing a certificate in this manner don't indicate that should be necessary.
I've tried setting the dwCertEncodingType to X509_ASN_ENCODING | PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING and PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING out of desperation (though I don't believe I am using PKCS#7 encoding here...a little fuzzy on that).
Does anyone have any suggestions on what I might be doing incorrectly here? I appreciate it.
","I figured out my issue. CertCreateCertificateContext is expecting the binary ASN.1 data, not the PEM-encoded certificate I created with openssl. I figured this out by using a Microsoft certificate generation tool and testing that certificate out:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin>makecert.exe -n ""CN=Test Signing Cert"" -b 0
1/06/2016 -e 01/06/2017 -len 1024 -r C:\Certificates\public_v2.crt
Succeeded

looking at the file in a hex editor, it looked precisely like the ASN.1 binary data. next, I used the Copy to File feature from the certificate viewer that launches when you double-click a certificate to copy my original public.crt file to a DER encoded binary X.509 (.CER) file and verified that my program began to work (that is, the CertCreateCertificateContext was now happy).
so, in case someone else is bumping up against the same issue I was having, here is a complete solution to importing a PEM-encoded certificate from a file into memory for use with the Crypto API:
#include ""stdafx.h""
#include <windows.h>
#include <wincrypt.h>

#define LF 0x0A

int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])
{
    char keyFile[] = ""C:\\Certificates\\public.crt"";
    BYTE lp[65536];

    SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES sa;
    HANDLE hKeyFile;
    DWORD bytes;

    PCCERT_CONTEXT  certContext;
    BYTE *p;
    DWORD flags;

    sa.nLength = sizeof(sa);
    sa.lpSecurityDescriptor = NULL;
    sa.bInheritHandle = FALSE;

    hKeyFile = CreateFile(keyFile, GENERIC_READ, FILE_SHARE_READ, &sa, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);

    if (hKeyFile) {

        if (ReadFile(hKeyFile, lp, GetFileSize(hKeyFile, NULL), &bytes, NULL) && bytes > 0) {

            p = lp + bytes;
            if (CryptStringToBinary((char *)lp, p - lp, CRYPT_STRING_BASE64_ANY, p, &bytes, NULL, &flags) && bytes > 0) {

                certContext = CertCreateCertificateContext(X509_ASN_ENCODING, p, bytes);

                if (certContext) {

                    printf(""yay!"");

                    CertFreeCertificateContext(certContext);
                }
                else {
                    printf(""Could not convert certificate to internal form\n"");
                }
            }
            else {
                printf(""Failed to convert from PEM"");
            }
        }
        else {
            printf(""Failed to read key file: %s\n"", keyFile);
        }
    }
    else {
        printf(""Failed to open key file: %s\n"", keyFile);
    }

    CloseHandle(hKeyFile);


    return 0;
}

Note:
because I'm lazy, I decode the PEM encoding to binary in the same BYTE array I used to load the file into -- for this simple test, it was expedient, but if you're looking to implement this sort of thing for real, I wouldn't recommend it

The applet is already signed, but when it tries to load their keystore, I get an access denied error related to sunMSCAPI.  It's being caused by the following lines of code:
store = KeyStore.getInstance(""Windows-MY"");
store.load(null, null);

From what I understand of applet signing, there are no additional steps after the signing process that I need to jump through (editing policy files and such).  I tried wrapping all the applet functionality within:
AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction() {
  public Object run() {
    etc...

But that didn't help.  I've rooted around and found some comments on various forums that sunMSCAPI is only available in JDK 6...which I've got.  I'm running out of ideas, and any help would be appreciated.
For potential aid, here's the stack trace of the access denied error:

","It seems that the keystore I was using to sign the applet was invalid somehow.  I generated a new one, signed with it, cleared the java cache, and everything started working nicely.
For completeness sake, here's the command I ran to generate the new store:
keytool -genkey -alias keyPair -keyalg RSA -validity 500 -keystore myKeyStore -keypass <password> -storepass <password> -dname ""<CN,OU,O,L,ST,C details>""

","First two are fine. But you need to use CryptExportPKCS8. It will export the private key to a buffer in PKCS #8 DER encoded form. From PKCS #8, you can get it into X509 structure of OpenSSL (by using d2i functions and memory buffer as input in BIO structures).
However, if the private key is marked as non-exportable, this function will fail.
Only use you can do is to sign the data using such private key.

","I'm leaving the answer as it is (after all without dbasic I would've been stuck :-)), but I have more to add:
CryptExportPKCS8() end of support ended with XP/2003, so we have to use PFXExportCertStoreEx() , however this function exports the WHOLE store. So, in order to export just one certificate you need to use a memory store.
Check out this example on how to do that:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa382037(v=vs.85).aspx
Insert the certificate you want into the memory store, and then use PFXExportCertStoreEx() to export what you need.

","Because you specified a length (parameter 2) of 0?
Edit: Just to clarify our eventual solution in the comments below, the code in the original question (since edited) contained two errors:

It was calling CryptBinaryToString instead of CryptStringToBinary.  Since it's invalid to pass a 0 in the second parameter to CryptBinaryToString, the function was failing.
It was passing 1 in the third parameter (dwFlags), which is interpreted as CRYPT_STRING_BASE64.  Since the string to encrypt wasn't in base 64 (it contained invalid characters such as ':'), the function was failing.  In general, passing a raw value instead of using an existing definition (e.g., CRYPT_STRING_BASE64) is not a good idea.

Is it possible that my encryption is having troubles when finishing the encryption of the file?   
Upon returning from CryptDecrypt, dwCount is equal to size, which is 11296.  Meanwhile, originalSize is equal to 11290.
","Shouldn't you be doing just the following
DWORD dwCount = size;
BYTE *somebytes = new BYTE[dwCount];

memcpy(somebytes, input, dwCount);

before calling CryptDecrypt? Why do you need to add a null character when CryptDecrypt already takes the number of bytes as it's final argument? I suspect that's what's breaking things as you've changed the input by clobbering the character at position originalSize - 1.
Edit:
Which is bigger, originalSize or size? Since CryptDecrypt re-uses the array it must be dimensioned with the bigger of the two. BTW, why do you think you need the extra one in the dimension?

Since I am null-terminating the decryption and still getting a problem only on the final characters, I don't believe that the decryption is the problem (although I would love to be wrong).

","This line is your problem (before the call to CryptDecrypt):
somebytes[originalSize - 1] = '\0';

It is overwriting part of the encrypted padding in the last block with a zero, which is causing the last block to decrypt to rubbish.  Just remove the line - the ciphertext isn't nul-terminated anyway (it almost certainly contains plenty of embedded nuls), the length parameter is used by the decryption routine to know how much data there is.
Oh, and... RC2? Seriously?

","after you finish writing to the CryptoStream you need to flush FileStream then finalflush the CryptoStream. After that close the CryptoStream first and the FileStream last. If you don't, all the original bytes whether from a MemoryStream/FileStream may not get written causing missing bytes. If the FileStream.Position does not equal FileStream.Length when you are done then FileStream.Length-FileStream.Position = missing bytes. So now when you try to get the decrypted data (Lord forbid by Serialization which will fail on you in that case), you will not get all the data back.

I need to convert this structure into a DER encoded byte array which is consistent with OpenSSL. The closest match I've got so far is via CryptEncodeObject using X509_ASN_ENCODING and the X509_CERT_TO_BE_SIGNED modifier which takes the CERT_INFO structure as input.
The problem is that it doesn't match with the output produced by the OpenSSL i2d_X509 function. Using a 2048 bit x509 certificate as input, OpenSSL produces 1789 bytes of encoded output whilst the Windows CryptoAPI produces 1638 bytes of encoded output.
The only option left that I can see is to create an X509 cert on the fly using the values from the CERT_CONTEXT structure and the encode the resulting object directly with the i2d_X509 function. The only problem with this is that I can't extract the private key from the smart card, so this may cause problems with the x509 cert creation routines. 
If anyone can provide any insight/advice/tips into these matters, I'd be much obliged.
","DER encoded certificate can be obtained from (ctx->pbCertEncoded, ctx->cbCertEncoded) buffer where ctx is a PCCERT_CONTEXT object. Still you won't be able to recover the private key.

Background: I need to pass X509 data of a certificate to Adobe's SDK CertListCab in order to sign the PDF using my Acrobat plugin api.
My question is how can I get the X509 data from a PFX certificate using CryptoAPI?
I've doing the following:

Converting my PFX certificate to a in-memory store.
CRYPT_DATA_BLOB data;
Open file and populate data.

FILE *fIn = fopen(""C:\\certificate\\MyPfx.pfx"", ""rb"")
    fseek(fIn, 0, SEEK_END);
    data.cbData = ftell(fIn);
    fseek(fIn, 0, SEEK_SET);
    data.pbData = (BYTE *)malloc(data.cbData);
    fread(data.pbData, 1, data.cbData, fIn);
    fclose(fIn);

HCERTSTORE hCertStore = PFXImportCertStore(&data, L""password"", 0);

Find the certificate. There is only one.

PCCERT_CONTEXT hContext = CertFindCertificateInStore
              (hCertStore, X509_ASN_ENCODING | PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING, 0, CERT_FIND_ANY, NULL, NULL);

Get the public key information for the certificate.

BOOL bFreeHandle;
      HCRYPTPROV hProv; 
      DWORD dwKeySpec; 
      HCRYPTKEY hCertPubKey;
CryptAcquireCertificatePrivateKey
              (hContext, 0, NULL, &hProv, &dwKeySpec, &bFreeHandle);
CryptImportPublicKeyInfo(hProv, X509_ASN_ENCODING | PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING, 
              &hContext->pCertInfo->SubjectPublicKeyInfo, &hCertPubKey));

Now I try to make space for the X509 data.

DWORD dwX509Len;
BYTE *x509Data;
CryptGetKeyParam(hCertPubKey,KP_CERTIFICATE,NULL,&dwX509Len,0);
x509Data = (BYTE*)malloc(dwX509Len);

I pass in my buffer.

CryptGetKeyParam(hCertPubKey,KP_CERTIFICATE,x509Data,&dwX509Len,0);


When I run my program I receive the error for CryptGetKeyParam:

NTE_BAD_TYPE : The dwParam parameter specifies an unknown value number.

According to the docs:

KP_CERTIFICATE : pbData is the address of a buffer that receives the X.509 certificate that has been encoded by using Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER). The public key in the certificate must match the corresponding signature or exchange key.

Am I doing something wrong? Is there another way to obtain the x509 data?
Any help would be appreciated.
Regards,
Magda
","Looks like I've over-complicated the issue.

hContext->cbCertEncoded

Still don't understand why using KP_CERTIFICATE did not retrieve the X509 data...

","The CryptUnprotectData function documentation states that it usually only works when the user has the same logon credentials as the encrypter.
This suggests to me that maybe the key is tied to the user's current token. Since you mention Vista, this makes me think UAC and restricted tokens.

"64258","Encrypt/Decrypt across machines is a no-no","I'm using an identical call to ""CryptUnprotectData"" (exposed from Crypt32.dll) between XP and Vista. Works fine in XP. I get the following exception when I run in Vista:
""Decryption failed. Key not valid for use in specified state.""

As expected, the versions of crypt32.dll are different between XP and Vista (w/XP actually having the more recent, possibly as a result of SP3 or some other update).
More specifically, I'm encrypting data, putting it in the registry, then reading and decrypting using ""CryptUnprotectData"". UAC is turned off.
Anyone seen this one before?
","Nice. Hopefully this is my bone-head move of the week! ;-)

This suggests to me that maybe the key
  is tied to the user's current token.

That was it. Turns out I was using encrypted data from another machine (the XP one) and trying to decrypt on the Vista machine.
As the MSDN documentation states:

Usually, only a user with the same
  logon credentials as the encrypter can
  decrypt the data. In addition, the
  encryption and decryption must be done
  on the same computer.

Once I re-encrypted the data on the Vista machine, decryption works as expected.
Thanks.

"4793583","Implement Windows CryptoAPI CryptDeriveKey Using OpenSSL APIs","I have a CryptoAPI code to encrypt\ decrypt given data using AES-128 and a key derived from a password using SHA-256.
How can I write an OpenSSL equivalent implementation so I would be able to encrypt data with it, then decrypt it with CryptoAPI and vice versa?
Trying to use EVP_BytesToKey with EVP_aes_128_cbc() and EVP_sha256() didn’t work “as is”. 
(By ""doesn't work"" I mean - can't decrypt CryptoAPI's generated encrypted data and vice versa. This does work for decrypt OpenSSL's encrypted data).
Any idea or good reference?

","Yes; in general you cannot use RSA to encrypt data larger than the key size in a single pass, the limit is infact slightly shorter than the key size, depending on padding.
To encrypt larger amounts of data you would typically use a hybrid approach whereby you generate a symmetric key (say AES) and use that to encrypt your data.
You can then use your RSA public key to encrypt the AES key, combine it with the ciphertext and you have a blob that requires the private key to decrypt.

","CryptExportKey has a limitation. It requires to export non-public keys in encrypted form. When you export public part or RSA key pair, it is OK to make the 2nd CryptExportKey parameter NULL and export key in unencrypted form. However, you can not do the same for symmetric key that must specify non-null hExpKey parameter.
If you specify hExpKey parameter, your code works, see example:
#include <Windows.h>
#include <cstdio>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    // Create AES key
    HCRYPTPROV hCryptProv_AES;
    if (CryptAcquireContext(&hCryptProv_AES, NULL, MS_ENH_RSA_AES_PROV, PROV_RSA_AES, 0))

If you want to do key exchange (lets say, if you want that Alice send to Bob her AES key), you have to do following steps:

Bob generates RSA key and sends its public part to Alice. See, Bob starts, not Alice!
Bob sends his key public part to Alice.
Alice generates AES key.
Alice encrypts AES key with Bob's public key.
Alice sends the AES key to Bob.
Bob uses his private key to decrypt AES key (i. e. import it with CryptImportKey). When you import the key, you set hPubKey parameter to non-NULL value, actually you set it to Bob's key handle, otherwise import will fail, because the AES key in encrypted.

On the client side, I am interested in knowing which Crypto API function calls are made by the windows processes when the client requests for an archival enabled certificate. In particular, my focus is to track the function calls listed here, http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa922849.aspx , present in Advapi32.dll .
I have tried out the windbg/cdb script here ( http://blogs.msdn.com/b/alejacma/archive/2007/10/31/cryptoapi-tracer.aspx ). I attached it to mmc.exe while making a certificate request but I couldn't detect any CSP calls being made during the process. I also tried requesting certificate through certreq.exe but windbg couldn't trace any CSP calls. I have also tried other forms of tracing as mentioned in the stackoverflow thread titled ""Monitoring application calls to DLL""
Please tell me which windows process/service I need to attach to, in order to find how these calls are being made. Is it possible to trace whenever a function call is made, irrespective of which process makes it?
Any suggestions on how to trace these CSP calls are most welcome!

In my ideal world, I would like the following to occur:

App Starts
App makes Windows trust the server's root CA (no GUI please, just system calls)
App talks to server, does its work, etc.
App makes windows forget about the server's root CA
done

I do NOT want this root CA to necessarily be trusted by other apps. Therefore I don't want to install the cert system-wide.
I also would like it if the user did not need Admin privileges.
My initial plan was to create an in-memory (CERT_STORE_PROV_MEMORY) store, add my cert to that, then add that in-memory store to the system store using CertAddStoreToCollection.
While all the CryptoAPI function calls succeed, WinHttp does not like it.
Here is the skeleton of what I'm doing - perhaps someone knows a trick?
Or perhaps this is wrong-headed in the first place?
hMemStore = CertOpenStore(CERT_STORE_PROV_MEMORY, ...);
pCert = CertCreateCertificateContext(..., pCertBytes, ...);
CertAddCertificateContextToStore(hMemStore, pCert, ...);
hRootStore = CertOpenSystemStore(NULL, ""ROOT"");
CertAddStoreToCollection(hRootStore, hMemStore, ...);

// Then later on...
WinHttpSendRequest(...)

A few notes:

Everything works when I use WinHttp's SECURITY_FLAG_IGNORE_UNKNOWN_CA, so I'm fairly sure this really is the issue.
I have already seen this SO question - it is close, but does not address the issue of making the cert only temporarily trusted, while the app runs.

Thanks!
","Since you don't want other applications to trust this cert, you need to do part of the certificate validation yourself. Disable the CA check with the option SECURITY_FLAG_IGNORE_UNKNOWN_CA and then get the call back for connecting to the server WINHTTP_CALLBACK_STATUS_CONNECTING_TO_SERVER. In that callback fetch the cert with WINHTTP_OPTION_SERVER_CERT_CONTEXT and do your validation. Cancel/Close the request if it's not who you want, continue the request if it's correct.

But the company didn't gave me any sdk so i have to do everything by C++ Microsoft CryptoAPI. I searched on google but i am not sure if i am on right direction

I am desperate to complete this task please guide me or show me correct tutorial if you experts know any. Or suggest me what should be done for such kind of task.. 
","you will be using both PKCS#11 and CryptoAPI functionalities.
PKCS#11 will be primarily used to talk to the hardware token. Every hardware vendor would have implemented a PKCS#11 interface for their hardware token. If your's is etoken,then safenet has one. Also safenet will have their CryptoAPI CSP that you can use to talk to the token.

","Looks like you will need to first put the certificate into a certificate store and then export it using PFXExportCertStoreEx passing dwFlags of 0 (i.e. not setting EXPORT_PRIVATE_KEYS).

","No need for a pfx.
The certificate is present inside the structure CERT_CONTEXT : just save the content of the buffer pointed by the member pbCertEncoded and whose length is the value of the member cbCertEncoded.
Moreover, the public key from this certificate is directly present in the CERT_CONTEXT structure : pCertInfo->SubjectPublicKeyInfo. For example, you can import it using CryptImportPublicKeyInfo and then call CryptEncrypt to encrypt data.
With these two options, you have all what is needed to start encrypting messages. Of course, the private key must be kept safe to be able to decrypt encrypted data.

"34324466","Crypto API RSA public key can decrypt data, is not asymmetric as expected","The problem I am encountering is that I am able to decrypt data using the same RSA 2048-bit public key that was used to encrypt the data. It seems to me that this defeats the entire purpose of encrypting the data in the first place, if a public key can decrypt it. The only thing I can consider at this time is that I'm generating symmetric key exchange pairs when I think I'm generating asymmetric pairs.
The end-user purpose of this is to use it later for transmitting user credentials to be authenticated when using an application away from the office, when I am unable to use their cached credentials from their workstations on the domain. I would theoretically be able to then decrypt these credentials using only the private key. 
I have produced a simple test class and code to reproduce my problem. The steps I'm taking are as follows:

Acquire a context to Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0
Generate a public / private key pair.
Export the public and private key BLOBs to separate files.
Load up the public key and encrypt some simple text.
Attempt to decrypt the same encrypted text using the public key (I expected it to fail here except for when I'm using the private key - yet both work).

Unfortunately I don't get the opportunity to work with C++ very often so you may notice some problems. Feel free to constructively criticize.
Does anyone know why I am able to decrypt data using the same public key?
My goal is to be able to irreversibly encrypt something on the client side where it can only be decrypted on the server, where the private key will hide. 
Edit:
I had considered that the hKey wasn't being destroyed properly by the ImportKey method, so I wrote this test case instead (same results - public key can encrypt and decrypt the data):
// CPPTests.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application.

    //Generate a 2048-bit asymmetric key pair
    edc->Generate2048BitKeys(CALG_RSA_KEYX);

    //Export the private / public key pair
    edc->ExportPrivatePublicKey(L""privpubkey.txt"");

    //Export only the public key
    edc->ExportPublicKey(L""pubkey.txt"");

    //Destroy everything and load up only the public key to write some encrypted data

    edc = new TestEncryptDecrypt();

","The problem is that for some reason Crypto API, using the Microsoft Enhanced Provider w/ RSA, produces symmetrical keys. I am unable to get it to produce asymmetrical keys. The algorithm will, however, work with asymmetrical keys. So this is good news for us. This means to get this to work we only have to generate keys. You could also export these from self signed certificates, use your companies CA, etc.
To solve this I produced a public/private key pair using OpenSSL. I compiled OpenSSL for Windows just for fun then ran the following statements to get myself a pair of unencrypted public/private key files:

openssl genpkey -out private2.pem -outform PEM -des3 -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
or
openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -out private_unencrypted.pem

Once I had those I added 2 new functions to my test helper class, ImportPublicKey and ImportPrivateKey. These will only import PEM files without a passphrase. I don't consider that much of a security threat, considering the public is public and the private should hide on a secure server somewhere, perhaps encoded with a hash.

"34324466","Crypto API RSA public key can decrypt data, is not asymmetric as expected","The problem I am encountering is that I am able to decrypt data using the same RSA 2048-bit public key that was used to encrypt the data. It seems to me that this defeats the entire purpose of encrypting the data in the first place, if a public key can decrypt it. The only thing I can consider at this time is that I'm generating symmetric key exchange pairs when I think I'm generating asymmetric pairs.
The end-user purpose of this is to use it later for transmitting user credentials to be authenticated when using an application away from the office, when I am unable to use their cached credentials from their workstations on the domain. I would theoretically be able to then decrypt these credentials using only the private key. 
I have produced a simple test class and code to reproduce my problem. The steps I'm taking are as follows:

Acquire a context to Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0
Generate a public / private key pair.
Export the public and private key BLOBs to separate files.
Load up the public key and encrypt some simple text.
Attempt to decrypt the same encrypted text using the public key (I expected it to fail here except for when I'm using the private key - yet both work).

Unfortunately I don't get the opportunity to work with C++ very often so you may notice some problems. Feel free to constructively criticize.
Does anyone know why I am able to decrypt data using the same public key?
My goal is to be able to irreversibly encrypt something on the client side where it can only be decrypted on the server, where the private key will hide. 
Edit:
I had considered that the hKey wasn't being destroyed properly by the ImportKey method, so I wrote this test case instead (same results - public key can encrypt and decrypt the data):

","This API is deprecated according to Microsoft, so if you came here looking for a native cryptography API, you may want to look elsewhere.
After some fighting with the same problem I realized where the error was.
In your first code you were acquiring your context with the last flag set to zero:
CryptAcquireContext(&hProvider, NULL, pszProvider, dwProvType, 0);

But in your solution you changed it into CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT.
CryptAcquireContext(&hProvider, NULL, NULL, PROV_RSA_FULL, CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT);

You solved your problem by changing this flag, not by importing the keys from OpenSSL. I am pretty sure that if you test this in your initial code, it will work as expected.
This CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT flag is responsible for not allowing a key to achieve persistence in the system, a persistence which turned the public RSA able to encrypt and decrypt.

"34549899","SSL Connection, Windows Certificate Store and CAPI engine","I am creating an SSL connection using OpenSSL API. As we know in a SSL handshake, series of Certificate Authentication occurs for Server or Client. Now for client certificate authentication, the client's certificate and associated private key are stored in Windows Certificate Store.
This certificate with private key is imported into the store after combining them into a pfx format and then that pfx file is imported to the windows Cert store. Now while importing this pfx file using mmc snap-in it asks whether we want to make the private key exportable or not. Now OpenSSL comes into picture for making SSL connection.
For that we have to create SSL_CTX object in which all the connection related properties are loaded. Now for loading private key from windows certificate store into SSL_CTX object, i have marked that private key exportable that i am exporting the key using Crypto API. But I think marking a private key exportable does not make any sense, it's a security breach.
Since private key will always be marked Non-Exportable so, is there any method or API of OpenSSL, etc that can directly read and load private key from windows cert store into SST_CTX object for making a SSL connection.
I know definitely there is some way for this to work but i am not getting it.
I have searched a lot for this but not got the required thing.
Summarized Question: The Certificate Store holds many certificates and associated private keys. How are the certificates and private keys accessed when making an SSL connection ?
EDIT : I have gone through an openssl engine API called 
 `EVP_PKEY *ENGINE_load_private_key(ENGINE *e, const char *key_id,
      UI_METHOD *ui_method, void *callback_data);`

Now how can i get this key_id of the private key and also i think this api internally called crypto api CryptExportKey and this api fails if private key is marked non-exportable.

"7551942","Getting certificate chain to a private root","I'm trying to verify that the certificate from a signature chains back to a particular root certificate, which is not trusted by Windows (it's a private certificate for the app).
My current attempt to do this involves creating a chaining engine which only trusts the specific certificate I want as the root, so that no other chains can be generated.
HCERTSTORE hPrivateRootStore = CertOpenStore(CERT_STORE_PROV_FILENAME, dwEncoding,
    NULL, CERT_STORE_OPEN_EXISTING_FLAG | CERT_STORE_READONLY_FLAG,
    _T(""C:\\Test\\PrivateRoot.cer""));
CERT_CHAIN_ENGINE_CONFIG config;
memset(&config, 0, sizeof(config));
config.cbSize = sizeof(config);
config.hRestrictedTrust = hPrivateRootStore;
config.dwFlags = CERT_CHAIN_CACHE_ONLY_URL_RETRIEVAL | CERT_CHAIN_ENABLE_SHARE_STORE;
HCERTCHAINENGINE hEngine;
CertCreateCertificateChainEngine(&config, &hEngine);
CERT_CHAIN_PARA params;
memset(&params, 0, sizeof(params));
params.cbSize = sizeof(params);
PCCERT_CHAIN_CONTEXT chains = NULL;
if (CertGetCertificateChain(hEngine, pCertContext, NULL, hStore, &params,
    0, NULL, &chains))
   ...

(error checking omitted for clarity; pCertContext and hStore came from CryptQueryObject extracting the signature and related certificates from a signed binary file.)
Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to work; despite using a custom chaining engine it still seems to be searching the OS store, and either doesn't find a chain or finds one to a different root (which is trusted by the OS).  I can only get the chain I want by adding my private root certificate to the OS trusted store.
I've also tried setting config.hRestrictedOther to an empty memory store, since the docs suggest that having hRestrictedTrust non-NULL will bring in the system stores again, but that doesn't make any difference.
Is there something I'm missing, or a better way to do this?
Edit: just to give a bit more context, I'm trying to do something similar to the driver signing certificates, where the signing certificate chains back to two different roots: one standard CA root trusted by the OS and one internal root (which in drivers is also trusted by the OS but in my case will only be trusted by my app).  The cross occurs somewhere mid-way up the ""main"" chain; there could potentially be a number of different files all signed with different ""real"" CAs but still chained back to my internal certificate.
","I've found a half-baked workaround now; it's a little ugly but it does kinda work.  I got the basic idea from Chromium's test suite; it involves installing a hook into Crypt32 such that when it tries to open the system stores to build the chain it gets my custom store instead, containing only my desired certificate.
The good is that this seems to force CertGetCertificateChain to go ""past"" the real CA certificate and chain all the way to my custom certificate, instead of stopping at the CA certificate (which is what it usually does when that is trusted).
The bad is that it doesn't seem to stop it from building chains to and trusting any other CA certificate.  I can work around that by explicitly verifying that the root of the chain is the certificate I wanted, but it's less than ideal, and I'm not sure if there are situations which will trip it up.
Still looking for any better solutions; I'm definitely getting the impression that I'm taking the wrong path somewhere.
Ok, new plan.  I'm now just walking the chain manually (since I know that all of the certificates I care about will be in the hStore extracted from the signed .exe), with basic structure like this:

Use WinVerifyTrust to do basic ""is it not tampered"" authentication.
Use CryptQueryObject to obtain certificate store hStore from the .exe
Use CryptMsgGetParam and CertFindCertificateInStore to find the signing certificate from hStore.
Starting from the signing certificate, use CertFindCertificateInStore with CERT_FIND_SUBJECT_NAME in a loop to find the potential issuer certificates; keep walking back until I hit a self-signed certificate or find my desired root (checking for a match via CertComparePublicKeyInfo).
Abandon a particular branch if CertVerifySubjectCertificateContext says that the signatures don't match.

Seems cleaner than the previous approaches I was trying.  Thoughts/comments/alternatives?
(Something which in some ways does seem to make more sense would be to add an additional custom countersignature [similar to the timestamping] instead of trying to chain certificates like this, but I can't find any information on doing that, or what the pros/cons are.)

","The code you linked is horrible. It appears the fellow wrote his encrypt method, and then subsequently wrote his decrypt method simply by copying and pasting the first method and making a few changes (yet leaving a ton of code left over from the encryption process). I wouldn't be surprised if it works, it's just that it wastes time and space doing useless work left over from encryption (plus the comments are all backwards).
As wincrypt is a Microsoft library, there are plenty of examples over at the MSDN. As MSDN samples are (usually) well-written and well-commented, they should be much easier to understand, so I would recommend you look at them instead.

","Asymmetric encryption limits the data to less than the key size, there is padding such as OAEP which is 42 bytes.
If you must have asymmetric encryption, that is need a key pair, use hybrid encryption which is essentially what https does. See Hybrid cryptosystem.
For Hybrid  encryption basically you create a random symmetric encryption key, encrypt the symmetric key with an asymmetric encryption, encrypt the data with the symmetric key and package the two encryptions together.
Why don't you want symmetric encryption? It is much faster and handles essentially any data size? AES is the encryption workhorse.

","I think the problem is that since you read the data in blocks of 4096 bytes - when the data is not a multiple of 4096 you endup including unwanted trailing 0's or possibly garbage values. Try bs.Read(1) instead of bs.Read(4096) in the loop: Loop Until bs.EOF in-order to test if correct hash is being calculated now. If successful adjust your loop to tackle the remainder (%4096) bytes separately.

"5365965","Pinvoking adwapi.dll - cryptDecrypt and cryptEncrypt functions, weird problem","I am observing wierd behaviour of this function, the string that I want to encrypt contains 14 bytes, if I use the function to send lenght of buffer = 14, it fails (""an internal error"" - very descriptive and most helpful error code), but it works when the buffer length (and the buffer itself) is 128 bytes large.
I overcame this problem by making a size 128 byte array and I copied the 14 bytes from the plain text (that I wish to encrypt),
When I decrypt those bytes, I must once again give the function the whole 128 byte array (which now has every byte encrypted, even the ones from #13-#127 (which I guess is to be expected)). Luckily for me the first 14 bytes get decrypted as they should, the rest is gibberish.
I would like to know why the encrypt method fails if the incoming buffer isnt 128 byte large, and also why decrypt function also requires a 128 byte array, is it some padding thing? 
This is how I call the encrypt function:
System.Text.ASCIIEncoding encoding = new System.Text.ASCIIEncoding();  // encoding type
byte[] buff = new byte[128];     // this is my buffer array, instantiated and initiated
string String2Encrypt = ""Testing"";      // this is the string I need encrypted
byte[] tempo = encoding.GetBytes(String2Encrypt);   // getting bytes from string
Buffer.BlockCopy(tempo, 0, buff, 0, tempo.Length);    // copying the small array into the large one
uint inputlength = Convert.ToUInt32(tempo.Length);   // getting the size of the small array 


bool DidIt = UnsafeNativeMethods.CryptEncrypt(MyKey, IntPtr.Zero, 1, 0, buff, ref inputlength, outputdatalength);     // calling the function

// in this case, the MyKey is pointer to a crypto key, 2nd argument is null, 3rd is ""true"" (no more data), no flags, buffer byte array  (128), Testing.Length in this case it is 7, 128
This is how I decrypt it:
IntPtr UserKeyLocal = MyUserKey;     // taking an argument (MyUserKey) and ""filling"" the local variable, not really relevant
byte[] dataCopy = new byte[buff.Length];   // init and insta the datacopy array (128 byte)
Buffer.BlockCopy(buff, 0, dataCopy, 0, (int)buff.Length);   // copying the argument array into a local version (I used this for testing to go around another problem), irrelevant
uint locinputlength = inputlength;  // another argument made local
bool DidIT = UnsafeNativeMethods.CryptDecrypt(UserKeyLocal, IntPtr.Zero, true, 0, dataCopy, ref locinputlength);     // calling the function

The result would look like this:
Testing?R????7?q?????$??uj??m%?b??e?a?74p?)?n9??w?R*O)E?i?+?>[?S???}Ct?n?&??b?P!?u1??%?JQ???/?mP?5wB????
Its almost working as intended but I need to be able to get ONLY the ""Testing"" part of the string without using tricks like substringing.
What I am trying to do (maybe there is an alternative way) is this; I have a binary (file) that has in it ""Testing"" encrypted by a public key I got from a certificate which I exported form a SmartCard. 
I need to verify (decrypt) this file by using my SmartCard (I am using its propriety CSP) with the private key. As you can see, it ALMOST works.
Thanks in advance.
","I think the reason the buffer must be 128 bytes is that a block cipher is being used.  In that case, the buffer length must be a multiple of the block size.  With a block ciper, the buffer may need to be larger than the size of the data anyway, so that the encrypted or decrypted data can be written to it (length(encrypted) != length(plaintext)).
After you call CryptDecrypt, the parameter pdwDataLen (locInputLength in your code) will contain the length of the actual data that was decrypted.  If you take only the first locInputLength bytes of dataCopy, does it give you what you need?

I overcame this problem by making a size 128 byte array and I copied the 14 bytes from the plain text (that I wish to encrypt),
When I decrypt those bytes, I must once again give the function the whole 128 byte array (which now has every byte encrypted, even the ones from #13-#127 (which I guess is to be expected)). Luckily for me the first 14 bytes get decrypted as they should, the rest is gibberish.
I would like to know why the encrypt method fails if the incoming buffer isnt 128 byte large, and also why decrypt function also requires a 128 byte array, is it some padding thing? 
This is how I call the encrypt function:
System.Text.ASCIIEncoding encoding = new System.Text.ASCIIEncoding();  // encoding type
byte[] buff = new byte[128];     // this is my buffer array, instantiated and initiated
string String2Encrypt = ""Testing"";      // this is the string I need encrypted
byte[] tempo = encoding.GetBytes(String2Encrypt);   // getting bytes from string
Buffer.BlockCopy(tempo, 0, buff, 0, tempo.Length);    // copying the small array into the large one
uint inputlength = Convert.ToUInt32(tempo.Length);   // getting the size of the small array 


bool DidIt = UnsafeNativeMethods.CryptEncrypt(MyKey, IntPtr.Zero, 1, 0, buff, ref inputlength, outputdatalength);     // calling the function

// in this case, the MyKey is pointer to a crypto key, 2nd argument is null, 3rd is ""true"" (no more data), no flags, buffer byte array  (128), Testing.Length in this case it is 7, 128
This is how I decrypt it:
IntPtr UserKeyLocal = MyUserKey;     // taking an argument (MyUserKey) and ""filling"" the local variable, not really relevant
byte[] dataCopy = new byte[buff.Length];   // init and insta the datacopy array (128 byte)
Buffer.BlockCopy(buff, 0, dataCopy, 0, (int)buff.Length);   // copying the argument array into a local version (I used this for testing to go around another problem), irrelevant
uint locinputlength = inputlength;  // another argument made local
bool DidIT = UnsafeNativeMethods.CryptDecrypt(UserKeyLocal, IntPtr.Zero, true, 0, dataCopy, ref locinputlength);     // calling the function

The result would look like this:
Testing?R????7?q?????$??uj??m%?b??e?a?74p?)?n9??w?R*O)E?i?+?>[?S???}Ct?n?&??b?P!?u1??%?JQ???/?mP?5wB????
Its almost working as intended but I need to be able to get ONLY the ""Testing"" part of the string without using tricks like substringing.
What I am trying to do (maybe there is an alternative way) is this; I have a binary (file) that has in it ""Testing"" encrypted by a public key I got from a certificate which I exported form a SmartCard. 
I need to verify (decrypt) this file by using my SmartCard (I am using its propriety CSP) with the private key. As you can see, it ALMOST works.
Thanks in advance.
","Yup, that did it! easy as pie!
            byte[] buffer = new byte[locinputlength];
            Buffer.BlockCopy(dataCopy, 0, buffer, 0, (int)locinputlength);
            return buffer;

One of those things you just dont ""see"" until you step back a little and look at the thing from a slightly different perspective ;)

","The problem which you have can be very easy explained. If you use v7.0A or v7.1 you are able to compile your project so that it will run under Windows 7. So the default value for the _WIN32_WINNT is 0x0601.
If you want co compile the program so that it will run on Windows XP you can define WINVER and _WIN32_WINNT explicitly. Typically one do this in the settings of the Visual Studio project inside of the preprocessor definitions. If you will do this the corresponding part of CERT_CHAIN_ENGINE_CONFIG structure will be displayed gray like you as want.
In the most cases and in the case of CERT_CHAIN_ENGINE_CONFIG it is not really needed. The Windows API are designed mostly so, that you will have no problems in the usage of CERT_CHAIN_ENGINE_CONFIG defined for Windows 7 in case of the start of the program on Windows XP. If you do define 
#define WINVER 0x0500
#define _WIN32_WINNT 0x0500

(or 0x0501 instead of 0x0500) you will be able to run your program in the Windows 7, but you will be not able to use the hExclusiveRoot and the hExclusiveTrustedPeople members. The reason is the cbSize field which you should initialize as sizeof(CERT_CHAIN_ENGINE_CONFIG). It gives for the CertCreateCertificateChainEngine function enough information about the size of the input structure CERT_CHAIN_ENGINE_CONFIG. In case of small value of cbSize, the last HCERTSTORE members hExclusiveRoot and hExclusiveTrustedPeople will be just not used.

"12260833","How do I export a HCRYPTKEY or PRIVATEKEYBLOB to a PFX file","I have a previously generated RSA private signing key, which is stored as a PRIVATEKEYBLOB. I am trying to move this into a new certificate for better management of the key. How do I take this blob and turn it into a .pfx certificate?
I have a HCRYPTPROV (uses MS_ENHANCED_PROV and PROV_RSA_FULL).
I can get a HCRYPTKEY from CryptImportKey.
PFXExportCertStoreEx seems to be the function to export it to a PFX blob (which I'm assuming I would then write to a file), but I don't understand how to get the key into it.
","If I correctly understand your problem you have the certificate and the corresponding private key as data blobs and both are separately. If you work with CryptoAPI it's important to understand that the API are mostly oriented on the working with certificates stored in certificate stores and private keys stored in key containers. The function like PFXExportCertStoreEx follows the approach and allows you to export all certificates from one certificate store to the data blob which can be just saved as a file with .PFX extension.
So what you can do is the following:

Create temporary certificate store by usage CertOpenStore with CERT_STORE_PROV_MEMORY parameter.
Place to certificate blob to the store using CertAddEncodedCertificateToStore function.
Create new key container using CryptAcquireContext with CRYPT_NEWKEYSET option. You should give some unique name to the container (see pszContainer parameter of the function).
Import the information from the PRIVATEKEYBLOB, which you currently have, to the key container with respect of CryptImportKey function.
Bind the certificate from the certificate store to the key container. To do this you should use CertSetCertificateContextProperty to set CERT_KEY_PROV_INFO_PROP_ID which is so named extended property of the certificate. It's important to understand that extended properties are not the part of 
X.509 specification. Extended properties allows you to store some additional information associated with the certificate in the certificate store (not in the certificate itself). In case of CERT_KEY_PROV_INFO_PROP_ID you can store full information (CRYPT_KEY_PROV_INFO) described the key container.
Now one can use PFXExportCertStoreEx to export the temporary certificate store (which holds only one certificate and has the link to the key container) to the memory blob and then save the memory blob in the .PFX file.
You should delete the key container created at the step 3. To do this you need to open key container using CryptAcquireContext with the CRYPT_DELETEKEYSET option.

","You can't use the public key to decrypt something encrypted with the private key. The public key is used only for encryption, while the private key can be used only for decryption.
From Wikipedia:

[...] The distinguishing technique used in public-key cryptography is
  the use of asymmetric key algorithms, where the key used to encrypt a
  message is not the same as the key used to decrypt it. Each user has a
  pair of cryptographic keys - a public encryption key and a private
  decryption key. The publicly available encrypting-key is widely
  distributed, while the private decrypting-key is known only to the

"21454545","PKCS #7 encryptedDigest decryption and validation using Windows Crypto API and C++","Intro
I am trying to perform the following operation to check certificate's SignedData.SignerInfo.encryptedDigest:
1) Read
SignedData.contentInfo +
SignedData.SignerInfo.authenticatedAttributes

2) Calculate Hash of contentInfo and authenticatedAttributes
using SignedData.digestAlgorithm

3) Read SignerInfo.encryptedDigest and certificate's PUBLIC key

4) Decrypt encryptedDigest using the acquired key
(it is the problem, and the question is about this)

5) Compare decryptedDigest's hash
with hash of contentInfo and authenticatedAttributes (STEP 2)

The problem
I tried a different ways to RSA-decrypt encryptedDigest with certificate's public key using Windows Crypto API, but each of them brings to error.

Attempt #1 to solve
Tried to use CryptDecrypt
Result: error 2148073485 (Key does not exist)
Please see the failing code below (sample #1).
Brief search tells, that the API doesn't allow to use public key for decryption.
If it is wrong, please give me a hint how to do it.
Attempt #2 to solve
Tried to use CryptVerifySignature
Result: error 87 (The parameter is incorrect)
Please see the failing code below (sample #2).
Tried to change the code in a several ways, but still could not find out the reason of invalid parameter error returning
What's wrong in the sample #2 ?
Other
I don't need a high-level functions, which perform a lot of other operations besides the required RSA decryption due to performance requirements.
It is also not desirable to use OpenSSL or other crypto libraries

","The encryptedDigest contains a signature, you don't decrypt it but verify the signature, so your second avenue of CryptVerifySignature is the promising one.
There could be multiple things that can go wrong here, for example you don't really tell us anything about the certificate. Please follow Example C Program: Encoding and Decoding a Countersigned Message on MSDN where you would be interested in CryptVerifyMessageSignature in step #2,
...
// From the recipient's point of view, the following code 
// completes these steps: 
//     1.  Decodes the message
//     2.  Verifies the signature on the message
//     3.  Adds a countersignature to the signed message
//

that all works fine, but then i want to use

","I have done something similar some time ago. The only difference is that I calculated a hash of ELF sections.

Probably your desc.flags should be CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_SLEEP until you have really good reason to prevent crypto operation from blocking.
Are you sure you didn't confuse crypto_shash_digest with crypto_hash_digest? Because crypto_*s*hash_digest() receives a pointer to data as its 3rd argument. If it's not true for you, what linux kenrel version are you talking about?

It has worked perfectly for many years under WindowsXP up to Windows 8. It no longer works on Windows 8.1. CryptSignHash fails with error code 87 (Invalid Parameter). CryptVerifySignature does not fail but returns NTE_BAD_SIGNATURE (for valid signatures created on Windows 8). We have tested everything we can .. it works on Windows 8 and below, fails on Windows 8.1.
Do you have any ideas on how to debug this further? 
We exported the imported public and private keys again and verified that they are correct.
We skipped using 'our' keys and generated new keys -> signing fails also with error 87
We generated new keys and encrypted/decrypted a message with them using RSA_FULL and DES -> no problem, works as expected. 
We checked the version of the RSA_FULL provider. It is 2.0 on both Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.
We tried explicitly specifying the provider name: Microsoft Base Cryptographic Provider v1.0 
Does signing work for any of you on Windows 8.1.? 
Is there anything else that is new on Windows 8.1. that could prevent signing from working? 
Has something changed with respect to the providers or algorithms that we should know? 
The application is written in Delphi, uses approximately the following flow: 
//Setup crypto provider 
CryptAcquireContext(@fhCryptProv, nil, nil,  cptRSAFull, [ccVerify, ccMachineKeySet]); 

//Create a hash structure
CryptCreateHash( fProvider.GetProviderHandle, chtSHA1, 0, 0, @fhHash);

//Import the private key for signing
CryptImportKey( fProvider.GetProviderHandle, @buff[0], len, 0, CRYPT_EXPORTABLE, @fKey);

//Hash the message
CryptHashData(fhHash, @aPlainText[1], length(aPlainText) * 2, 0);

//Sign the message
CryptSignHash(fhHash, AT_SIGNATURE, nil, CRYPT_NOHASHOID OR CRYPT_X931_FORMAT, @buff, @len);

","CryptSignHash fails on Windows 8.1 when CRYPT_X931_FORMAT flag is set. This looks like a Windows 8.1. bug. 
This bug can be reproduced by running the MSDN Sample Code from the url below, using CALG_SHA1 instead of CALG_MD5 for hashing and setting the flags in CryptSignHash to  CRYPT_NOHASHOID | CRYPT_X931_FORMAT; leaving the flags at 0 or just at CRYPT_NOHASHOID works on the systems I tested with. 
I never had any problems with these flags on WindowsXP to Windows 8.0 systems.

The values you're seeing as your ""hashes"" are actually the pointers, 80 bytes apart (since they are pointers to two different memory blocks).
In order to get the actual hash from the handle, you need something like the following, which prints the hex digits:
CHAR hexDigits[] = ""0123456789abcdef"";
BYTE md4Hash[MD4LEN];
DWORD cbHash = MD4LEN;
if (CryptGetHashParam (hHash1, HP_HASHVAL, md4Hash, &cbHash, 0)) {
    printf(""MD4 hash is: "");
    for (DWORD i = 0; i < cbHash; i++) {
        printf (""%c%c"", hexDigits[md4Hash[i] >> 4], hexDigits[md4Hash[i] & 0xf]);
    }
    printf(""\n"");
} else {
    DWORD dwStatus = GetLastError();
    printf (""CryptGetHashParam failed with code %d\n"", dwStatus); 
}

For comparing the two hash values, you can do:
BYTE md4Hash1[MD4LEN], md4Hash2[MD4LEN];
DWORD cbHash1 = MD4LEN, cbHash2 = MD4LEN;

CryptGetHashParam (hHash1, HP_HASHVAL, md4Hash1, &cbHash1, 0);
CryptGetHashParam (hHash2, HP_HASHVAL, md4Hash2, &cbHash2, 0);

if ((cbHash1 == cbHash2) &&
    (memcmp (md4Hash1, md4Hash2, cbHash1) == 0))
{
    // they are equal.
}

","As the other answers have noted, hHash1 and hHash2 are opaque handles — comparing them is pointless, as that's akin to comparing the addresses of two different objects that have the same value.
Use CryptGetHashParam to get the hash values and compare those instead:

The CryptGetHashParam function retrieves data that governs the operations of a hash object. The actual hash value can be retrieved by using this function.

","For anyone who's interested:
The CERT_INFO structure that is passed into CryptSignAndEncodeCertificate contains a SubjectPublicKeyInfo field that is a CERT_PUBLIC_KEY_INFO structure.  I was originally attempting to take the pointer received from CryptExportPublicKeyInfo and assign it to SubjectPublicKeyInfo via Marshal.PtrToStructure.  As it turns out, Marshal.PtrToSTructure just causes SubjectPublicKeyInfo to point to the same memory location as the returned pointer.  When the pointer is freed, the memory is invalidated and SubjectPublicKeyInfo is left in an undetermined state.  The way to get around it is to create a new structure and then assign this new structure to SubjectPublicKeyInfo.  This causes the values from the new structure to be copied to SubjectPublicKeyInfo so its memory location is never invalidated.  Or at least that's the nearest I can figure.  If anyone has a better explanation, I'd love to hear it.

Note: It took 3 days to come up with those 15 lines of code for symmetric encryption. i'm hoping someone can same me from a week of banging my head against a wall, and i end up going down the wrong path thinking that i have to install OpenSSL. Even worse, if i try to call COM Objects from native code

It all works fine when the certificate is installed on the local machine (I am using a self signed certificate for testing and I have the private key for the certificate) but When I try to access the private key from a remote machine using the same code, I get the ""Keyset does not exist"" exception.
I am using a console application for testing, and I have made sure that my id have read permissions on the private key on the remote server. Here is the sample code I am using:
var store = new X509Store(@""\\server1\My"", StoreLocation.LocalMachine);
store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);
var result = store.Certificates.Find(X509FindType.FindBySubjectName, ""server1.test.com"", false);
var certificate = result[0];
store.Close();

//This succeeds from both local and remote server
var rsaPublic = (RSACryptoServiceProvider)certificate.PublicKey.Key;

//This succeeds from local, but fails from remote server
var rsaPrivate = (RSACryptoServiceProvider)certificate.PrivateKey;

I have found a similar unanswered question on SO, but it is using un-managed code, whereas I am using the managed API, but both seems to be having the same root cause.
","We contacted Microsoft support for a solution and here is the response that we got:

Why is the private key not available when the code is executed on server2?
A: This is actually by design.  Certificate stores are different from private key storage.  While you can enumerate certificates remotely, private keys cannot be accessed remotely.  
Can this issue be fixed by giving the user extra privileges or by changes in group policy settings? 
A: No.  This doesn’t involve privileges or permission to the file.  
If not both of the above then can you suggest the suitable solution?
A: 1. You can install the certificate on all machines so each one has a copy of the private key.
            2. You can create a roaming domain user.  A roaming certificate is the only situation where private keys can be roamed between machines.
                 Roaming profiles are located on a server, when the user logs on, a temporary copy of the profile (including private key) is created.
             3. Use a third party cryptographic provider.  There are some cryptographic providers that do allow remote private key access and cryptographic operations.

"16015408","Digital signature made in C# does not verify in C++","I have a C# application which digitally signs data using RSA. The code is as follows:
RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();
rsa.ImportCspBlob(privateKeyBlob);

SHA1 sha1 = new SHA1CryptoServiceProvider();
sha1.ComputeHash(myData);

byte[] signature = rsa.SignHash(sha1.Hash, CryptoConfig.MapNameToOID(""SHA1""));

I cannot verify the signature in C++. The code is as follows:
HCRYPTPROV cryptProvider;
CryptAcquireContext(&cryptProvider, 0, 0, PROV_RSA_FULL, CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT);
// PROV_RSA_SIG does not work

HCRYPTKEY publicKey;
CryptImportKey(cryptProvider, publicKeyBlob, publicKeyBlobLength, 0, 0, &publicKey);

The verification returns 0, GetLastError() returns 2148073478 ""Invalid signature"". The hashes are the same. I tried it with and without the CRYPT_NOHASHOID flag.
I tried signing the data in C++ (just to compare the results). I removed the CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT flag. But importing the private key BLOB fails with 1008 ""An attempt was made to reference a token that does not exist"". Generating a new key fails with the same error.
","After an exhausting byte by byte inspection, I got it working. There were two problems in the C# application.
1) I used new RSACryptoServiceProvider(RsaKeySize) to generate a key pair. The problem is that this generates a key pair for key exchange, not for signing. C# doesn't mind, but it caused trouble in the C++ program. The correct way for generating a key pair is:
CspParameters parameters = new CspParameters();
parameters.KeyNumber = (int)KeyNumber.Signature;

RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(RsaKeySize, parameters);

2) The RSACryptoServiceProvider reverses its output (signatures, encrypted data). It is mentioned in the documentation. So you need to Array.Reverse() the computed signature before saving it.

"37717931","How to export a password-protected private key using MS CryptoAPI?","Using Microsoft CryptoAPI, I've generated a new RSA key pair, and am now trying to export the private key to a PKCS#8 encrypted (password-protected) PEM file.
I first investigated CryptExportPKCS8() and CryptExportPKCS8Ex(), but the former doesn't support encrypting the key, and the latter is not exported by crypt32.dll. MSDN says that both functions have been deprecated anyway.
My current attempt is to pass a session key derived from the password to CryptExportKey():
HCRYPTPROV provider;
BOOL result = CryptAcquireContext(&provider, CONTAINER_NAME, MS_ENHANCED_PROV, PROV_RSA_FULL, CRYPT_NEWKEYSET | CRYPT_SILENT);
HCRYPTKEY keyPair;
result = CryptGenKey(provider, CALG_RSA_KEYX, (2048 << 16) | CRYPT_EXPORTABLE, &keyPair);

HCRYPTHASH hash;
result = CryptCreateHash(provider, CALG_SHA1, 0, 0, &hash);
const char *password = ""password"";
result = CryptHashData(hash, (const BYTE *)password, strlen(password), 0);
HCRYPTKEY sessionKey;
result = CryptDeriveKey(provider, CALG_3DES, hash, CRYPT_EXPORTABLE, &sessionKey);

DWORD blobSize;
result = CryptExportKey(keyPair, sessionKey, PRIVATEKEYBLOB, 0, NULL, &blobSize);
BYTE *blobBytes = new BYTE[blobSize];
result = CryptExportKey(keyPair, sessionKey, PRIVATEKEYBLOB, 0, blobBytes, &blobSize);

DWORD derSize;
// This throws ""First-chance exception ... Access violation reading ..."" and returns FALSE
result = CryptEncodeObjectEx(X509_ASN_ENCODING | PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING, PKCS_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY, blobBytes, 0, NULL, NULL, &derSize);
// error is 3221225477 (0xC0000005)
DWORD error = GetLastError();
BYTE *derBytes = new BYTE[derSize];
result = CryptEncodeObjectEx(X509_ASN_ENCODING | PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING, PKCS_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY, blobBytes, 0, NULL, derBytes, &derSize);

// ... CryptBinaryToString() to convert to PEM

// ... Write PEM to file

All calls succeed up until the commented CryptEncodeObjectEx().
If I don't pass the session key to CryptExportKey() then I can successfully use CryptEncodeObjectEx() to encode the private key, but obviously it is then plain-text.
How can I export a password-protected private key? Is there something wrong with the way I derive the session key? Is PKCS_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY the wrong encoding type?
I've been testing in Visual Studio 2013 on Windows 7.

... blah blah blah ...

As you can see, libgmp is mentioned in the LDFLAGS. So much confusion ensued. After a while just on a whim, it tried the following modification to the Makefile:-
LDFLAGS = -O3 -Wall \
        -lglib-2.0   \
        -Wl,-rpath /usr/local/lib -lgmp \

So now, for some weird reason it compiles fine.

","I'd say the only way to detect at compile time is to write a separate program that will do a runtime check for AF_ALG sockets and create a header file with a define such as #define AF_ALG_AVAILABLE.
Expanding on your answer to the second question, you may want to make sure errno holds EAFNOSUPPORT. Otherwise, another error, such as being out of file descriptors, will make your program falsely believe that AF_ALG is not supported, which could be bad if you are checking for AF_ALG at compile time using my method.
Checking at compile time:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <linux/if_alg.h>

int main(){
    //Alternatively you can set the path to argv[1]
    FILE *f = fopen(""/path/to/output/file"", ""w"");
    if(f == NULL){
        //Handle error
    }
    int sockfd = socket(AF_ALG, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);
    if(sockfd == -1){
        if(errno == EAFNOSUPPORT){
            //Unavailable, put whatever you want here
            fprintf(f, ""#define AF_ALG_UNAVAILABLE\n"");
        } else {
            //Unable to detect for some other error
        }
    } else { //AF_ALG is available
        fprintf(f, ""#define AF_ALG_AVAILABLE\n"");
    }
    close(sockfd);
    fclose(f);
    return 0;
}

Then just compile and run that in your makefile, and you will find your header file where you put it. Then you can simply select what code to use using #ifdef AF_ALG_AVAILABLE.

"15899094","MD5-SHA1 hash using CryptoAPI","I have requirement of signing a data using MD5-SHA1 hash (MD5 hash and SHA1 hash of the data are combined and then signed).
Primary requirement:
MD5-SHA1 hash is provided by OpenSSL in some way that is not exposed. This hash is complete.
Now my requirement is to sign this hash using Crypto API without hashing (only signing is required, not hashing again). Why CryptoAPI, not OpenSSL? Because, I am dealing with a certificate with non-exportable private key. Its private key can only be used by CryptoAPI, not by OpenSSL.
This scenario is from SSL handshake where send Client verify part (under the case of non-exportable private key) to my layer and is trying to sign the data using CryptoAPI.
Also, I would like to know about other ways of making the use of non-exportable private key certificates using OpenSSL.
","By using CALG_SSL3_SHAMD5 in CryptCreateHash and after that calling CryptSetHashParam and then calling the CryptSignHash did the job for me.
Let me detailed out the requirement:
1. Generally, I gave private key using EVP_PKEY to OpenSSL function so that it can do the signing part. I used to extract the private key from Windows Certificate store (when key is marked as exportable). But in one scenario, private key is not marked as exportable and I was not able to get private key to EVP_PKEY. So, I did modification to OpenSSL code on the case when private key is not available, then the signing part is implemented using CryptoAPI (since CryptoAPI allows the signing using such non-exportable key).
So, in my case, data is completely hashed by OpenSSL (using md5-sha1 hash). Only thing left for me is to do signing.
So, following steps (under signing part) did the job:
1. Created hash using Certificate key handle provider and use CALG_SSL3_SHAMD5 algorithm.
2. Using CryptSetHashParam, I set the initial hash value
3. Signed the hash using CryptSignHash.
4. After that, reverse the bytes order (as OpenSSL signature is Big endian mentioned [here][1] which I found after lots of experimenting).

Rest of code of OpenSSL seems happy with this signature.

Where, obviously, FriendlyName is an LPWSTR pointing to the friendly name and certContext is the valid certificate context from saving the certificate in the store.  The function works correctly and the name is written into the certificate.  However, when I view it in the certificate snap-in, the last letter of the name is truncated.  I have tried adding one to the length of the name and that ends up cutting the name in half.  I have checked FriendlyName and the length to ensure they are correct and they are.

So, I am able to successfully encrypt my string.  When I then take the encrypted binary string and try to decrypt it, everything works except the last call to CryptDecryptMessage .  The decryption code I am using is below.
As the code stands, the first call to CryptDecryptMessage, to get the required size of the output buffer, succeeds, BUT it always returns a size equal to the cleartext string size plus 6.  I then size up my output buffer, and the next call to CryptDecryptMessage fails (return value is zero, dwSizeRequired gets set to zero, nothing is put in the output buffer, and GetLastError returns NTE_BAD_KEY).
On the other hand, if I uncomment the #define TESTING_INCORRECT line, the behaviour is slightly different.  The first call to CryptDecryptMessage succeeds.  Its return value is zero, but GetLastError returns ERROR_MORE_DATA, which one would expect, and most importantly dwSizeRequired is set with the size of the original cleartext string that was encoded.  I then allocate and call CryptDecryptMessage the second time, it fails again as above.
Lastly, I do have the private certificate key in my keystore.

","I would investigate the keys being used. The return code of 2148073475 actually translates to 0x80090003, which is NTE_BAD_KEY. GetLastError of 234 is ERR_MORE_DATA, which indicates an undersized buffer. 
I think the problem lies in the expectation that the first call to CryptDecryptMessage will receive NULL as the pointer to pbDecrypted because its a sizing call, but as its non-null with the comment removed, it gives the 234 result thinking its trying to decrypt something that's already been sized. 
If the presumption that the receipt buffer on the sizing (first) call should be null is correct, then that leads me to suggest that the key(s) may be suspect in some way per the NTE_BAD_KEY error code.
Hope that stirs some helpful thought for you.

"29153790","How do I generate a SHA256withRSA signature with the Windows CryptoAPI?","I need to sign some data with the SHA256withRSA algorithm (RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5-SIGN with SHA-256 hash function) in Windows, and I'm having some validation errors. I was wondering if anyone has experience trying to do it.
The summary of what I'm doing:
CryptAcquireContextW with MS_ENH_RSA_AES_PROV and PROV_RSA_AES
CryptImportKey after running CryptStringToBinary on a pem and applying to that CryptDecodeObjectEx with PKCS_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY
CryptCreateHash with CALG_SHA_256
CryptHashData and CryptSignHash using AT_KEYEXCHANGE to use the imported key (AT_SIGNATURE didn't work)

If you want the detailed version, it's here:
Create a CSP
WCHAR const container[] = L""ContainerName"";
HCRYPTPROV provider;
CryptAcquireContextW(
    &provider,
    container,
    MS_ENH_RSA_AES_PROV,
    PROV_RSA_AES,
    0));

    nullptr, &key_bytes_size,
    nullptr, nullptr);
key_bytes = new BYTE[key_bytes_size];
CryptStringToBinaryA(
    key_string,
    0,
    CRYPT_STRING_BASE64HEADER,
    key_bytes, &key_bytes_size,

    PKCS_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY,
    key_bytes, key_bytes_size,
    0, nullptr, 
    nullptr, &key_blob_size);
key_blob = new BYTE[key_blob_size];
CryptDecodeObjectEx(
    X509_ASN_ENCODING | PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING,
    PKCS_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY,
    key_bytes, key_bytes_size,
    0, nullptr, 
    key_blob, &key_blob_size);

HCRYPTKEY key_handle;
CryptImportKey(
    provider,  // The one I created before
    key_blob, key_blob_size, 
    nullptr, 0,
    &key_handle);

(I hate that the API is so verbose, especially the two-step dance to ask for a length and then fill the buffer)
Once I've done this, I then hash and sign my data:
char const data[] = ""Stuff to sign"";
HCRYPTHASH hash_handle;
CryptCreateHash(provider, CALG_SHA_256, 0, 0, &hash_handle);

DWORD data_length = std::strlen(data);
CryptHashData(
    hash_handle,
    reinterpret_cast<const BYTE*>(data), data_length,
    0); 

DWORD signature_size;
BYTE* signature;
CryptSignHash(
    hash_handle,
    AT_KEYEXCHANGE,  // AT_SIGNATURE didn't work
    nullptr, 0,
    nullptr, signature_size);
signature = new BYTE[signature_size];
CryptSignHash(
    hash_handle,
    AT_KEYEXCHANGE,  // AT_SIGNATURE didn't work
    nullptr, 0,
    signature, signature_size);

Will this produce the kind of signature I want? Should I set different parameters for the AcquireContext call?

The signing process seems to be ok, but I am having a problem getting the decode part to work.
Since I am not relying on certificates, I am using CryptSignMessageWithKey and CryptVerifyMessageSignatureWithKey. The call to CryptVerifyMessageSignatureWithKey, however, is returning a CRYPT_E_ASN1_BADTAG error. Looking for the problem on internet I found one or two discussions on similar topics, but I could not gather some solution from them.
All my code is Crypto API-based. The relevant (I think) parts of it are:
CryptAcquireContext(&hCryptProv, cryptContainerName, MS_ENHANCED_PROV, PROV_RSA_FULL, 0);

...

CryptGetUserKey(hCryptProv, AT_SIGNATURE, &hKey);

...

CryptExportKey(hKey, NULL, PUBLICKEYBLOB, 0, pbKeyBlob, &dwKeyBlobLen);

...

publicKeyInfo.Algorithm.Parameters.pbData = NULL;
publicKeyInfo.PublicKey.pbData = pbKeyBlob;

publicKeyInfo.PublicKey.cUnusedBits = 0;

...

// ***** ERROR: CRYPT_E_ASN1_BADTAG
CryptVerifyMessageSignatureWithKey(&sigParams, &publicKeyInfo, pbBuffer, dwCount, decodedBlob, &dwCount);

Should I transform somehow the public key I got from CryptExportKey to ASN1, and store it in publicKeyInfo.PublicKey.pbData? If it is so, how do I do that?
What is the point I am missing here?

Dan

The encryption is done using the Windows Enhanced crypto api. It seems to work perfectly and outputs a 128 byte Ciphertext to file.
I have no idea what sort of cryptographic form the Ciphertext is in (Whether it's padded, encoding etc) (I'm just importing the public key and encryptiong with it (No extra settings))
Anyway I need to be able to decrypt the Ciphertext back to plaintext using the private key with a php script.
I've tried using openssl over command line during testing but I got a data greater than mod len error.
Are there any transformations I need to do with the Ciphertext before trying to decrypt it or any settings I need to specify with the openssl_private_decrypt. (I currently have the private key in pem format but I can convert it to many more formats)
Also any suggestions for other php libraries that might be more effective for this than openssl would be appreciated.
Thanks.
","If you want to decrypt the data using OpenSSL, reverse the data byte by byte. This is because OpenSSL considers them as big endian.
This question may help you. I faced similar problem for calculating hash. When I reversed the byte order, it works perfectly in OpenSSL. So, this might help you.

","I found a solution.
PHP generates keys with extra fields in ASN.1 format compare to CryptoAPI keys.
1. I decoded base64 key into a binary file with help of this tool: base64 decoder
2. Then I just cut from this file first 26 bytes to the next header sequence starting from something like: ""30 xx xx"" and saved it.
3. And encoded this file back to base64 with: base64 encoder
Now I can import public and private keys into CryptoAPI without problems with next code:
// key types
const
  PKCS_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY = LPCSTR(43);
  PKCS_RSA_PUBLIC_KEY = LPCSTR(19);

function ImportKey(hProv: HCRYPTPROV; KeyType: pointer; key: string): hKey;
var
  BuffSize, BlobSize: longword;
  buff, blob: pointer;
begin
  result := 0;
  buff := nil;
  blob := nil;

  try
    if not(CryptStringToBinary(PWideChar(key), 0, 1, nil, @BuffSize, nil, nil)) then
      exit;

    GetMem(buff, BuffSize);
    if not(CryptStringToBinary(PWideChar(key), 0, 1, buff, @BuffSize, nil, nil)) then
      exit;

    if not(CryptDecodeObjectEx(X509_ASN_ENCODING or PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING,
       KeyType, buff, BuffSize, 0, nil, nil, @BlobSize)) then
      exit;

    GetMem(blob, BlobSize);
    if not(CryptDecodeObjectEx(X509_ASN_ENCODING or PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING,
       KeyType, buff, BuffSize, 0, nil, blob, @BlobSize)) then
      exit;

    if not(CryptImportKey(hProv, blob, BlobSize, 0, 0, @result)) then
      exit;

  finally
    if buff <> nil then
      FreeMem(buff);
    if blob <> nil then
      FreeMem(blob);
  end;
end;

","I encountered a similar situation where I was generating keys using PHP5's openssl API, and importing them using Windows CryptoAPI, except I'm using C++.
The 26 byte offset fixed importing private keys for me, but I found the offset for public keys to be 24 bytes. As Mike K. pointed out, you need to offset until the next header sequence, I found that the first two bytes of the sequence will be ""30 82"".  So if you run into a situation where 24 bytes or 26 bytes doesn't work, check out the key in a hex editor and look for those bytes.
Here is the code I had success with:
DWORD PEMToPublicKeyBlob(char* keyData, DWORD keyDataLen, BYTE** publicKeyBlob, DWORD* length)
{
    DWORD ret = ERROR_SUCCESS;
    wchar_t message[256];

    BYTE* der = NULL;
    DWORD derLen = 0;

","Encrypted output is different. It means that key which is ultimately used is different or data is different. But data is same, hence key must be different.
It means in the process of key generation, something is different. It might be possible that OpenSSL may be using some other key deriving function which is not visible here. Try to use some standard algorithm for key generation. Instead of hashing, try not to use hash.

","If you want to understand what is going on, you should read about block cipher operations here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_codebook_.28ECB.29
In a nutshell, block ciphers chaining causes the input of one block operation to be fed into the next block operation. This obscures any block-level patterns in the ciphertext. Since there is a chaining structure, the last block gets an input from the second last block, and so on... until the second block gets an input from the first block. Now the first block needs to get an input from something, but there are no preceding blocks. So we use something called an Initialization Vector (iv) to start it off. This IV does not need to be secret like the key, but it does need to have a low probability of re-use (otherwise the attacker can use it to correlate the first blocks of all your ciphertexts). Typically random numbers are used, or sometimes increasing sequence numbers.
In regard to the specific call:
Your method works to decrypt a single block using DES. (Which is nowadays considered out of date and insecure, by the way, please consider using AES instead - the block cipher structures remain the same so all you need to do is swap the library). Anyway,
Since you're using a cipher in ECB mode, each block is decrypted independently with the same initialization vector, which is provided to your Decrypt method call. The call to CreateDecryptor initializes a decryption object using the provided secret key and initialization vector.
The actual decryption is performed using the call to TransformFinalBlock. The arguments are the input byte array, and then an offset and a length parameter (used for when you don't want to decrypt the entire byte array). In this case you do want to use the entire byte array so the starting offset is 0 and the size is the length of the whole byte array.
One thing you should probably add is to check that the input byte array is the correct block size for your cipher, otherwise it will throw an exception. In the case of DES, this is 64 bits. If you switch to AES as I recommended it will be 128 bits.

","No, code itself does not have Windows privileges.
As pointed out in comments you can use 2 processes running under different accounts (which immediately adds plenty of interesting issues how to communicate between two). 
Or you can impersonate account with your code, but Windows permissions would apply to any code that runs while impersonating and not to just code from particular native DLL/.Net assembly.

I believe I've been successful at getting CryptEncrypt() to work (AES_128) for encrypting a file.
But when I Use CryptDecrypt() to decrypt the file, the first 16 bytes are corrupted and then after 4000 bytes (which is the size of the chunks I'm pulling from ReadFile() and encrypting) is another chunk of corrupted bytes and so on. If I try to decrypt a file with a total length less than 4000 bytes, the decryption works perfectly.
I'm very confused about why this is happening. There are no errors at all.
Here is a snippet of my code (I have CryptEncrypt() and CryptDecrypt() right after each other to save me exporting the key and to make the testing faster):
DWORD bytesRead;
DWORD bytesWritten;
DWORD pointer = 0;
unsigned int blockSize = 4000;
void *fileBuffer = new unsigned char[4106];
bool EOF = false;
do
{
    SetFilePointer(hFileOrginal,pointer,0,0);

    WriteFile(hTempFile,fileBuffer,bytesRead,&bytesWritten,NULL);

I would really appreciate any suggestions about whats going wrong.

","You are not doing any error handling at all.  All of the API functions you are calling have return values and error codes, none of which you are checking.
You are also not managing bytesRead correctly.  CryptEncrypt() modifies the variable you pass to it, which then affects your call to CreateDecrypt(), which also modifies it, and that then affects subsequent calls to SetFilePointer(), which you should not be calling in your loop to begin with.  You are not validating that you have as many bytes as you are expecting, or that bytesRead ends up back at the original value that ReadFile() returned, so you may end up skipping bytes in the source file.

"34732586","Is there an API to pre-retrieve the list of trusted root certificates on Windows?","I am using Python and OpenSSL to connect to a site using TLS (in some cross-platform software, so it would be too much work to switch to CryptoAPI for everything); I don't want to distribute (and update) a custom list of certificates, though.  I want to get them from the platform.  On OS X and Linux this is fairly straightforward, but Windows ships with an incomplete list of trusted root certificate authorities for TLS; basically just Microsoft's own certificates, then dynamically adds trust roots to the store when high-level TLS stuff (such as loading a web page in Internet Explorer over HTTPS) has to verify a trust root it hasn't previously seen.  (This process is explained here.)  This means I can enumerate the Windows root certificate store with wincertstore, but it's useless because on machines with more recently-installed OSes, that store will be almost empty.
Microsoft provides detailed instructions for administrators to pre-retrieve this list so as to be able to operate machines with tightly-controlled network access; however, I cannot find any reference to an API that will do the same thing, and just download all trusted root certificates from Microsoft.  (Honestly, in the age of weekly multi-megabyte system updates, I don't see why pre-downloading these is such a big deal, if it's just a cache; for bonus points please explain why this needs to happen at all.)
So: is there an API that would allow me to tell the system to just pre-cache the trusted root certificates according to whatever rules it uses?  Failing that, if it's really impossible (i.e. if CryptoAPI can only download one trust root at a time and only if you feed it a certificate signed by that root), is there a way to hook up OpenSSL certificate verification to CryptoAPI's trust store so that the verification will download and cache trust roots just like a native TLS connection would?
","This is not an ideal approach, but it should do at a pinch and it may give you somewhere to start.  This code will take the .sst file generated by certutil -generateSSTFromWU and add all the certificates to the root store:

Alternatively, in your context, you might prefer to use the root certificates in the .sst file directly, without also adding them to the root store.  (In that case you should probably enumerate the root store as well as the .sst file, so as to include any locally added certificates.)

My applet simply lists certificates from Windows certificate store and lets user sign his/her transaction by allowing user select his/her preferred certificate.
I would like to prevent users from signing without a USB token/smart card, which means my applet shouldn't show/list a certificate if its private key is not stored in a USB token/smart card.
I retrieve certificates like this (Removed try catch block):
keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""Windows-MY"", ""SunMSCAPI"");
keyStore.load(null);

enumeration = keyStore.aliases();
while(enumeration.hasMoreElements()) {
    String alias = (String) enumeration.nextElement();
    Certificate ksCertificate = keyStore.getCertificate(alias);

    ...
}

I manage the signing like this (Removed try catch block):
// Retrieve private key
privateKey = (PrivateKey) keyStore.getKey(alias, null);

// Sign data by using certificate's signing algorithm
Signature signer = Signature.getInstance(certificate.getSigAlgName(), keyStore.getProvider());

signer.initSign(privateKey);
signer.update(data);
result = signer.sign();

I couldn't find any way to differentiate whether a certificate is from a USB token. I checked both Certificate and PrivateKey objects, however I couldn't find any attribute that could be helpful for me.
Any suggestions on how to do this with MSCAPI? Or any suggestions as MSCAPI alternative?
(The reason why I don't/can't use PKCS11 is that multiple brands of tokens need to be supported worldwide, and the requirement is that the applet shouldn't maintain the list of PKCS11 dll paths inside for each token. Retrieving dll paths from server side is also not accepted. So in this case I can't use PKCS11. Please correct me if I am wrong.)

","After learning more about DPAPI
Password Change
In this method, there is continuity of access to the user's master keys during a password change. The DPAPI is invoked by the Winlogon component during password change operations in an Active Directory domain:
* DPAPI receives notification from Winlogon during a password change operation.
* DPAPI decrypts all master keys that were encrypted with the user's old passwords.
* DPAPI re-encrypts all master keys with the user's new password.

Password Reset (Set)
In this method, an administrator forcibly resets a user password. A password reset is more complex than a password change. Because the administrator is not logged on as the user and does not have access to the user's old password, that old password cannot be used to decrypt the old master key and re-encrypt it with the new password.

We are currently building a system where we have to use the windows keystore to get certificates that are stored on USB token containing both reader and certificate.  Unlike the original question we do not experience problems when loading the keystore but when we are accessing it.  If there is only a single certificate in the keystore no problem, we get the appropriate password popup at the appropriate time and that's it.  However if a second USB key gets inserted in the system and later removed the entry remains in the keystore and from then-on every time we try to access information in the keystore we get a popup to insert the key.  This occurs for every certificates in the store for which the key is not currently connected to the computer.
The system we are interfacing with that requires these certificates necessitates that we perform multiple cryptographic operations and to have these popups to come up every times is rather annoying to say the least.
","This might be a bug with your Windows CSP for the tokens. Once the certificates are added to the store, they need to be removed when the device is removed, either by the CSP or some additional ""removal"" utility. 
You can check from certificate manager, what happens if you enter a single key and then remove it, do the certificates disappear from the ""my certificates"" list.

Although it's a 2048 bit key as well. If I trim the blank lines and the header, CryptStringToBinary succeeds and translates it into a binary format, but CryptDecodeObjectEx fails (GetLastError() returns 0x8009310B). Removing the checksum didn't work either.
I'm a bit lost here so, basically, Is there a way to obtain a RSA public key exported with GPG and use it to encrypt data with Windows CryptoApi?
Thank you.
","Converting OpenPGP Keys to PEM
Extracting the RSA public key from an OpenPGP key and conterting it to PEM format is possible. Sysmisc has an article about converting to and from OpenPGP keys in different ways. For the way OpenPGP to PEM, it boils down to:
gpgsm -o  secret-gpg-key.p12 --export-secret-key-p12 0xXXXXXXXX
openssl pkcs12 -in secret-gpg-key.p12 -nokeys -out gpg-certs.pem

OpenPGP has its own Message Exchange Format
Yet a caveat, if you want to encrypt to an OpenPGP user, he will not be able to read any (Open, ...)SSL encrypted information using an OpenPGP implementation like GnuPG. OpenPGP not only uses a different key format, but also another message exchange format.
If you want to send OpenPGP messages, use GPGME to interface GnuPG from C, there might also be other libraries for doing so.

I've check that both programs are using the same data.

CryptDeriveKey creates a key 07,f1,e2,ea,d4,c8,79,74,03,a6 (according to CryptExportKey), the same as the first 10 bytes of the md5 generated in Linux (which I shorten to match the requested 80-bit key).
Neither are using a salt on the algorithm (or at least are not reporting as such)
They are both using an 8-byte IV of {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}
They are both using the RC2 algorithm
They are both using CBC mode

I cannot figure out why they are returning different data. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

If a certificate imported to cert store that the private key not in local computer (on USB token, external storage, e.g. mobile device), it can found?
","When you import a certificate to the system store, Windows creates a BLOB structure that contains an encoded certificate itself and it properties. 
BLOB has following structure:
property1_id (4 bytes)
reserved = 0x00000001
property1_length (4 bytes)
property1_data[property1_length]
...
cert_property_id = 0x00000020
reserved = 0x00000001
cert_data_length (4 bytes)
cert_data[cert_data_length]

Therefore, if you want that your imported certificate to have link to a private key, you need to set CERT_KEY_PROV_INFO_PROP_ID. You can achieve that with CRYPT_KEY_PROV_INFO structure and CertSetCertificateContextProperty function.
For example:
#include <Windows.h>
#include <wincrypt.h>

void SetKeyLink()
{
    HCERTSTORE hStore = NULL;
    CRYPT_KEY_PROV_INFO key_prov_info = { 0 };

    if (!hStore)
    {
        goto Exit;
    }

    der_encoded_cert = LoadFromFile();

    pCertContext = CertCreateCertificateContext(X509_ASN_ENCODING, der_encoded_cert.data(), der_encoded_cert.size());
    if (!pCertContext)
    {
        goto Exit;
    }

    /* For legacy CSP */
    key_prov_info.dwProvType = PROV_RSA_AES; // Or YOUR_PROVIDER_TYPE
    key_prov_info.dwKeySpec = AT_SIGNATURE; // Or AT_KEYEXCHANGE
    key_prov_info.pwszContainerName = L""Your_key_name"";
    key_prov_info.dwFlags = CERT_SET_KEY_PROV_HANDLE_PROP_ID;
    key_prov_info.cProvParam = 0;
    key_prov_info.pwszProvName = nullptr;
    key_prov_info.rgProvParam = 0;

    /*
    Or if you use CNG Key storage provider:

    // Or L""Your_CNG_key_storage_provider_name""
    key_prov_info.pwszProvName = L""Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider""; 
    key_prov_info.pwszContainerName = L""Your_key_name"";
    key_prov_info.dwFlags = CERT_SET_KEY_PROV_HANDLE_PROP_ID;
    key_prov_info.dwProvType = 0;
    key_prov_info.dwKeySpec = 0;
    key_prov_info.cProvParam = 0;
    key_prov_info.rgProvParam = 0;
    */

    if (!CertSetCertificateContextProperty(pCertContext, CERT_KEY_PROV_INFO_PROP_ID, 0, &key_prov_info))
    {
        goto Exit;
    }

    if (!CertAddCertificateContextToStore(hStore, pCertContext, CERT_STORE_ADD_ALWAYS, NULL))

        goto Exit;
    }

    std::cout << ""success"";

Exit:

    if (pCertContext)
    {

    }

    if (hStore)

        CertCloseStore(hStore, 0);
    }
    return;

For now your certificate will look something like this (sorry for not English):

When Windows wants to get private key, it calls CryptAcquireCertificatePrivateKey which in turn calls CertGetCertificateContextProperty(..., CERT_KEY_PROV_INFO_PROP_ID, ...).

","So I found a solution, which when generating an HMAC_SHA1 for the data ""message"" with the key ""key"" generates the expected hash of 2088df74d5f2146b48146caf4965377e9d0be3a4
As you can see, this code uses CryptImportKey instead of CryptDeriveKey, which seems to resolve the issue. It seems that using CryptDeriveKey is actually generating an HMAC_SHA1 hash using the data ""message"" and the SHA1 Hash of the key ""key"" encoded as RC4 instead of the plaintext key as initially thought.
The code works for keys upto 16 characters in length, any larger and only uses the first 16 characters anyway. I'm posting a second quesiton to enquire about that!!

I've found a few examples of this so it seems to be possible, however, the PCCERT_CONTEXT I get back for each certificate has an invalid pointer for pbCertEncoded and cbCertEncoded (buffer size) is always 0, but I do not feel this should be the case as examples use the encoded buffer to convert the certificate into other formats. Has anyone else run into this issue of getting an empty buffer or can see a step i'm missing?
I've verified I am actually getting the certificates with the CryptUIDlgViewContext() function. I feel like I'm missing something very basic. Basic code below:
HCERTSTORE hStore = CertOpenSystemStore(NULL, L""ROOT"");

for ( PCCERT_CONTEXT pCertContext = CertEnumCertificatesInStore(hStore, NULL); pCertContext != NULL; pCertContext = CertEnumCertificatesInStore(hStore, pCertContext) )

"23824389","Importing pfx/p12 file into smartcard c#","Is there a way to Import a .p12/pfx file to Smartcard programmatically? I know it works via certutil:
certutil -user -p ""pw"" -csp ""csp"" -importpfx path

I am using ""Microsoft Base Smart Card Crypto Provider""
Via certutil it is working thus I am sure it also should using c# (maybe CRYPTOAPI)...I just don´t want to use kind of (starting cmd adding the ""Import string""): 
System.Diagnostics.Process process = new System.Diagnostics.Process();
System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo startInfo = new System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo();
startInfo.WindowStyle = System.Diagnostics.ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden;  
startInfo.FileName = ""cmd.exe"";            
startInfo.Arguments = strCmdText;           
process.StartInfo = startInfo;            
process.Start();

to Import the pfx! 
But I have no clue how this could work programmatically in c#. Any help will be appreciated.
","You can import a PFX/P12 file into a smart card using C# by combining the use of the class X509Certificate2 that provides parsing of the PFX/P12 file and P/Invoking CryptoAPI functions in order to perform the actual import.
I have implemented this in a C# console program that replicate certutil import functionality. You can get its source code from http://www.idrix.fr/Root/Samples/PfxImporter.cs .
I also implemented this in C++ if anyone is interested. Here is the source : http://www.idrix.fr/Root/Samples/PfxImporter.cpp .
Last point: As documented in the smart card minidriver specification, two registry keys must be modified to permit the import operation using the MS Base CSP  :

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\Defaults\Provider\Microsoft Base Smart Card Crypto Provider\ AllowPrivateExchangeKeyImport = DWORD:0x01
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\Defaults\Provider\Microsoft Base Smart Card Crypto Provider\ AllowPrivateSignatureKeyImport = DWORD:0x01

"4816610","Porting Microsoft CryptoAPI to Mac OS","I have a windows application (Visual Studio is used) that uses
Microsoft CryptoAPI. Now it is required to develop a Mac OS X
application, that is capable to read data, encrypted by the WinApp,
and encrypt data on Mac OS X, that will be decrypted by the WinApp.
Encryption/decription in the WinApp initialized in the such way:
::CryptAcquireContext(&m_hCryptProv, NULL, MS_DEF_PROV, PROV_RSA_FULL, CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT);
::CryptCreateHash(m_hCryptProv, CALG_MD5, 0, 0, &m_hCryptHash);
::CryptHashData(m_hCryptHash, pbtPSW, dwPSWLen, 0);
::CryptDeriveKey(m_hCryptProv, CALG_RC4, m_hCryptHash, 0, &m_hCryptKey);

And for encryption/decription the following is used:
::CryptEncrypt(m_hCryptKey, 0, TRUE, 0, pBuf, &dwCnt, dwLen);
::CryptDecrypt(m_hCryptKey, 0, TRUE, 0, pBuf, &dwCnt);

As I understand, I need to find a library that implements MD5
hashing plus RC4 encoding/decoding. It seems that there are a
number of such libraries. For example: matrixSSL, OpenSSL. But
using of the libraries for my puproses is not obvious (especially
taking into account, that I am not familiar with Sequrity/Crypting
APIs). Could somebody recommend a particular ciphering library? May
be there are code examples for my task?
ADDITION:
It seems the main problem is that I need a portable analog of the ::CryptDeriveKey, that is compatible with Microsoft version (i.e. generates the same key). Does anybody know a such one? Or an algorithm of creating a key by the ::CryptDeriveKey?
","I would recommend taking a look at the CyaSSL embedded SSL library. It supports the current standards up to TLS 1.2 and is very portable across operating systems. In particular, CyaSSL includes the CTaoCrypt cryptographic library which should let you perform the crypto operations you're looking for.
Some helpful documentation links for CyaSSL:
CTaoCrypt Usage Reference: http://yassl.com/yaSSL/Docs_CTaoCrypt_Usage_Reference.html
CyaSSL Docs Page: http://yassl.com/yaSSL/Docs.html
If you download CyaSSL, you'll find a Visual Studio project file to take a look at as well.

What do I do wrong?
","Thanks to this wonderful website I just found : referencesouce.microsoft.com, I've been able to disassemble what the C# API does when verifying a signature and importing a key. 
Apparently I need ncrypt/bcrypt, and signature is verified against a hash, and not the data itself:
public bool VerifyData(Stream data, byte[] signature) {
            if (data == null) {
                throw new ArgumentNullException(""data"");
            }
            if (signature == null) {
                throw new ArgumentNullException(""signature"");
            }

            using (BCryptHashAlgorithm hashAlgorithm = new BCryptHashAlgorithm(HashAlgorithm, BCryptNative.ProviderName.MicrosoftPrimitiveProvider)) {
                hashAlgorithm.HashStream(data);
                byte[] hashValue = hashAlgorithm.HashFinal();

                return VerifyHash(hashValue, signature);
            }
        }

        [SecuritySafeCritical]
        public override bool VerifyHash(byte[] hash, byte[] signature) {
            if (hash == null) {
                throw new ArgumentNullException(""hash"");
            }
            if (signature == null) {
                throw new ArgumentNullException(""signature"");
            }

            // We need to get the raw key handle to verify the signature. Asserting here is safe since verifiation
            // is not a protected operation, and we do not expose the handle to the user code.
            new SecurityPermission(SecurityPermissionFlag.UnmanagedCode).Assert();

            // This looks odd, but Key.Handle is really a duplicate so we need to dispose it
            using (SafeNCryptKeyHandle keyHandle = Key.Handle) {
                CodeAccessPermission.RevertAssert();

                return NCryptNative.VerifySignature(keyHandle, hash, signature);

","You don't call main() again. You rather use this program as an example to write a separate function, like this:
void PrintMD5(const char *s)
{
    MD5Context ctx;
    MD5Init(&ctx);
    MD5Update(&ctx, (const unsigned char *)s, strlen(s));
    MD5Final(&ctx);

    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
        printf(""%02x"", ctx.digest[i]);
    }

    printf(""\n"");
}

Then you can call this from your own program like:
PrintMD5(""FooBarHelloWorld42"");

Thanks in advance!
","dwFlags needs to be SIGNER_TIMESTAMP_RFC3161 (2).  The reason you get an access violation is that SignerTimeStampEx2() is documented incorrectly.  It expects the algorithm as a PCSTR rather than a DWORD.  If you pass 0x800C it'll try to dereference that as a pointer, leading to the AV.  So replace ALG_ID dwAlgId in the function declaration with PCSTR pszTimeStampAlgorithmOid.  Pass szOID_NIST_sha256 to it, which should be defined as ""2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1"".
SignerTimeStampEx3() is also incorrectly incorrectly documented.  pszTimeStampAlgorithmOid should be declared as PCSTR rather than as PCWSTR.
In my experience, code signing and time stamping are more reliable if you specify both the file name and an open Win32 file handle in the SIGNER_FILE_INFO structure.
Whether you will actually get an SHA-256 time stamp also depends on the time stamping service you're using.  http://tsa.starfieldtech.com, http://timestamp.globalsign.com/ and http://timestamp.comodoca.com/rfc3161 issue SHA-256 timestamps.  Other services may issue SHA-1 time stamps even when requesting an SHA-256 time stamp.

Those supplying the encrypted string is an external contractor and they prefer (almost demand. cant change contractors though, the higher ups decide that stuff...), to use Microsoft's Crypto API to encrypt the string. 
Well, fair enough, AFAIK I can decrypt that with C#, but after endless searching I am still at a loss on how it works.
That means I cant even supply example code, and I am stuck in this bind until I can decrypt this string.
What I have is:
I have the common password they encrypt with and I have to use to decrypt it with.
Encryption settings are: ""CALC_AES_128"" hash: ""CALC_MD5"". The string is encrypted, then hashed.
So I want to unhash it, and decrypt it.
I know its a lot to ask but how do I go about it?
","Your external contractor doesn't know what he is talking about.
Hashes are used as a trap door function, a way to recognize something without been told what that thing IS. It is a digital fingerprint. The way a CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY SECURE hash is made, means even given the hash and the algorithm it is difficult to create an object that matches the fingerprint.
AES is a non-deterministic cypher. The non-determinisism comes from the Initialization Vector, which is meant to be a random number each time (not hard coded from a die roll, ahem Sony). This means for all intents and purposes, the output of AES is pure random (unless you have the key). Good cyphers are all designed to produce data that is statistically random (thus there is little data to form an attack from).
So by feeding data into a function that creates random data, then putting it into a trap door function, you have produce something that is truly difficult to decode (difficult in this sense is mathematically, you actually need more energy than exist in the universe to compute this).
As for how to send data across in a secure manner (secure as in against prying eyes on an unsecure network) in the query string? There is a well known protocol that .net supports that does this very well. Its called HTTPS.

"19505091","Dynamically create Cipher using configuration: What parameters are necessary?","Java uses the Cipher class as an abstraction to the specific cipher implementations. In my project, I mainly use symmetric block ciphers (AES, Twofish, 3DES, ...) and I'm looking for a way to dynamically create/initialize any possible symmetric block ciphers (using an XML configuration), because I'd like to make encryption configurable.
Example: <transformer type=""cipher"" cipher=""AES/GCM/NoPadding"" keysize=""256"" iv=""true"" unlimitedstrength=""true"" />
will be translated to:
// Create secretKey using 'keysize' ...

if (encryption.isUnlimitedCrypto()) {

Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(encryption.getCipherStr(), Encryption.PROVIDER);

if (encryption.isIvNeeded()) {

    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey, new IvParameterSpec(iv));
}
else {
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);
}

My question ist: What parameters are necessary to instantiate any symmetric block cipher in Java?
Parameters (already identified):

Cipher String: String for Cipher.getInstance(..), e.g. AES/CBC/PKCSPadding 
Key size: Size of the key for the key generation (or the PBE key derivation function)
IV needed: Indicates whether an IV is needed, e.g. ""true"" for CBC and GCM mode, but not for ECB
IV size: Indicates the size of the IV (right now I assume IV size = key size, correct?)
Unlimited strength needed: Indicates whether enabling the unlimited strength policy files is necessary
Others?

Original source/project:

Implementation: https://github.com/binwiederhier/syncany/blob/e3d11300b34c133d01431d6e041b4eb39b6bec33/src/org/syncany/chunk/CipherTransformer.java
Desired Usage in Tests: https://github.com/binwiederhier/syncany/blob/e3d11300b34c133d01431d6e041b4eb39b6bec33/tests/org/syncany/tests/config/EncryptionTest.java#L114

","All modes other than ECB require an IV. The IV will always be equal to the block size of the cipher (16 bytes for AES, 8 bytes for 3DES). ECB mode is insecure when encrypting more than 1 block of plaintext with the same key, and should not be allowed if you want confidentiality to be ensured. 
The algorithm used will dictate what key size is required. AES, for example, requires 128, 192, or 256 Unlimited strength policies need to be installed for 192 and 256 if using Java's standard crypto API. The unlimited strength policy is not something you can toggle with code, it has to be installed in the end users JRE.
If you care about securing data in transit (and this project has real security needs), I can not urge you strongly enough to use SSL/TLS for this instead. Creating a secure crypto system is difficult to do, and bulk encryption (i.e. symmetric ciphers like AES, 3DES) are not enough by themselves to ensure security. You also need a cryptographically strong source of random data, a safe key exchange process and integrity verification. Confidentially is difficult to provide without also ensuring integrity which is generally provided by using MAC functions. There are all pitfalls to avoid when implementing a secure crypto system like making sure you use different keys for cipher and MAC, verifying MACs correctly so as not to create a timing attack vector, using a proper random generator, ensuring integrity so as not to create a padding oracle, etc.
As you can see there are a lot of moving parts to protecting transmitted data, and doing it from scratch can lead to vulnerabilities introduced by incorrectly chosen or misconfigured crypto primitives. This is why TLS is often recommended.
Below is an example of an anonymous (no authentication) TLS session established by two sockets. This example is not secure because neither of the parties authenticates the other, however confidentiality and integrity are established. The reason I'm using this insecure cipher suite in the example is it is easy to demonstrate TLS usage without getting in to keystores and truststores (used for the authentication part)
The cipher suite being used is TLS_ECDH_anon_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, which is not normally enabled by default, because of the aforementioned lack of authentication. Below I break down this cipher suite

TLS - This cipher suite was introduced by the TLS standard.
ECDH_anon - Eliptic Cuve Diffie-Hellman algorithm is used for key agreement, however the key agreement is not authenticated.
AES_128_CBC - Advanced Encryption Standard with a 128-bit key length in Cipher Block Chaining mode is used for bulk encryption.
SHA - Secure Hash Algorithm is used to ensure integrity of the encrypted data.

","MSDN - 

The CryptRetrieveTimeStamp function encodes a time stamp request and
  retrieves the time stamp token from a location specified by a URL to a
  Time Stamping Authority (TSA).

Most likely you didn't provide the valid TSA in first parameter, which is - 

wszUrl [in]
A pointer to a null-terminated wide character string that contains the URL of the TSA to which to send the request.

Edit - The suggested solution is to change time stamping authority.

","Well, I'm not an expert in RSA/Microsoft store, but I think I get what you're trying to do here. You're doing it a bit backwards. You're using the public key to encrypt and the private do decrypt. So the assumption is that you'd have the private key since that is what you used to generate the public key.
So, let's see... to decrypt the data you need a key, right? So you can (a) encrypt the data with the public key and then find a way to export the private key, but then you'd be using something akin to private key encryption and you'd be better off using blowfish anyway, or (b) encrypt the data using your private key so that you can share the public key to decrypt. Remember CryptImportPublicKeyInfo returns a handle to it: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380209(v=vs.85).aspx
So what I'm saying is that you already have your answer. It's there when you say you have a symmetric key. Either you'll use the same public key to decrypt or it will be a simple transformation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm

I have documents that describe APDU commands that I can (and know how to) run.
I need to save small files (data) to the card like name, address, photo etc.
And later on save certificates.
In the documentation I read that you have to do do external authentication to later use secure messaging to access the files on the card.
I have an error somewhere in the mutual authentication algorithm (requires calculating a MAC, DES, TRIPPLE DES etc and i have tried for weeks to get it working...)
I know how to do everything on the card except for functions that require mutual authentication.
I looked at the functions provided by the CSP and don't see any external authentication there. The only place i saw non APDU level external auth was in ""Windows Smart Card Minidriver Specification"" where i see functions like: CardAuthenticateEx.
But i dont know how to call them (which dll they are in).
Should these functions be in the CSP?
Is it a wrong approach to go low level with APDU commands when i have the CSP.
Should I instead use CryptoAPI or CAPICOM? If so then how can i external authenticate and use files if there are no (or i can't find) functions that would write to a file. (again all these functions are in the ""Windows Smart Card Minidriver Specification"".
","Many smartcards follow the Global Platform specification, which (depending on the installed applets on the card and how they are configured) may require a security handshake before communicating with the card.
If you need to write files to the card, you will NOT be using the CSP. The CSP supports OS level cryptographic interactions by re-routing certain crypto calls to the card's processor. To write to a file on the card, you'll be sending APDUs to the card that perform the following functions:

Authenticate with the card
(optionally) Select an applet/cardlet
using the AID (applet ID) 
Select a directory
Select a file 
Write data to the file

My company makes a plugin for IE and Firefox browsers that helps with this, it includes handshake functions for global platform, and we have a ""sandbox"" form on our site that lets you test your scripts for card interactions.

The 64-byte signature generated should ideally be signature pair (r,s) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_DSA).

Is there a way to understand the 64-bytes signature generated so that I can map the signature blob contents to (r,s) pair in linux and verify it?

The r and s are in P1363 format, which is simply a concatenation of r and s in a 2's compliment format. That is, the signature is simply r || s.
You need to know the hash to use this format. For example, SHA1 will create a r of 20 bytes and an s of 20 bytes. If r or s is ""too short"", then it is padded on the left with 0's.
Java and OpenPGP are different than P1363. Java and OpenPGP use an ASN.1 encoding:
SEQUENCE ::= {
  r INTEGER,
  s INTEGER
}

Depending what library you use on Linux, you may have to convert between the formats. Cryptographic Interoperability: Digital Signatures gives examples of signing and verifying using a few different libraries.


Or is there a simpler way to verify the generated signature in linux?

Try Crypto++. I believe Microsoft and Crypto++ uses the same signature format, so you won't need to convert. See Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm for details.

I know that signtool can take an additional certificate for cross-signatures trust via the /ac argument, but have not been able to figure out how to do the same using SignerSign or SignerSignEx.  I've even spied on signtool's API calls, and mirroring them does not seems to produce the same affect.
Be aware, signtool or other command-line utilities cannot be used for this purpose due to project constraints.

Say I have a rfc3161 TimeStamp request; I send this to my TSA and I receive a rfc3161 TimeStamp response (probably using libcurl). How should incorporate the response into my SigParams? Must I extract the TimeStampToken and then store that as an unauthenticated counter signature? Something like:
CRYPT_ATTR_BLOB cablob[1];
CRYPT_ATTRIBUTE ca[1];    
cablob[0].cbData = tstResponseSize; 
cablob[0].pbData = tstResponse; // the response from TSA

ca[0].pszObjId = ""1.2.840.113549.9.6""; // object identifier for counter signature
ca[0].cValue = 1;
ca[0].rgValue = cablob;

And then set the SigParams:
SigParams.cUnauthAtt = 1;
SigParams.rgUnauthAttr = ca;

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

"44996810","Exporting PFX file from windows certificates store","Our application uses OpenSSL for securing communication between client device and server. The certificates are generated by customers CA and we had to upload server certificate and private key to Windows OS based machine.
Until now we guide our customers to save a PEM files which include server certificate and private key at specific directory on server file system and our application upload it from there. Lately, we were asked by customer to read a PFX certificate from local windows certificate store.
I can think of 2 options which both combines use of CAPI library for exporting the PFX file from WCS (according to friendly name), serializing it and then uploading it using OpenSSL API.
The first option save it as temporary file on server file system then read as before with OpenSSL API.
The 2nd option uses memory i.e. pass pointers instead of using temporary file.
My team spent a lot of time searching the web (mainly Stack Overflow) and trying code snippets but didn't found working solution. I understood that the private key should be exportable marked during importing the file to WCS.
When I tried below code for simple exporting certificate and saving it to file (first half of option #1 based on MS example code) it writes only one character to file.
What do I miss here? Do I need to reformat certificate?
Any Idea of what is wrong and what is the right way to do it?
Can the private key be extract this way?

","It means what it means: the function is not guaranteed to be thread-safe. It probably has an internal static (or global) state, but that's an implementation detail.
Whether you use or not the same hash or key is irrelevant.

Edit after comment: according to this MSDN page, CryptoApi key handles are not thread safe because of the internal key state:

Most algorithms and modes require that data be decrypted in the same order that it was encrypted. This is a difficult task in a multithreaded environment because use of a critical section will not address the ordering issue. If you are using a block cipher (that is, RC2, DES, or 3DES) in ECB cipher mode, then this issue is not a factor because the internal key state does not change. However, ECB is not the default cipher mode. CBC is the default cipher mode. With CBC cipher mode, the internal key state does change. 

So after all, it would seem reasonable to think that you can indeed use CryptEncrypt on several threads if they don't share the same key. This is merely a guess, though.

You fail WINAPI forever. It took me like five seconds to launch Calc.exe and convert it to hex: 8009000D, which looks like a perfectly valid error HRESULT.

Let's take some time to analyze it a bit more:

8 is ERROR.
9 is not 7, meaning it's not a regular Win32 error. A search in Visual C++ headers tells me 9 is FACILITY_SSPI.
If I search 8009000D in Visual C++ headers, I get this line:
#define NTE_NO_KEY _HRESULT_TYPEDEF_(0x8009000DL) There, you have it, it's your error: NTE_NO_KEY.
MSDN is rather unhelpful, but Google shows some other questions about the NTE_NO_KEY error, such as this.

","Session key is a symmetric key (meaning same key used for encryption and decryption). It is EXCHANGED with the other node secretly using asymmetric key pair (public and private keys).
So you do not generate session key from public key, rather you come up with a session key on your own (or better yet negotiate through some protocol as pointed out in comment e.g. D-H key exchange) and encrypt that using the other node's public key and send. So only the other side can discover the session key because ONLY it can decrypt data using its private key.

// Open an HTTP connection.
HttpReq.Open(""GET"", ""https://www.fabrikam.com/"", false);

// Select a client certificate.
HttpReq.SetClientCertificate(
            ""LOCAL_MACHINE\\Personal\\My Middle-Tier Certificate"");

// Send the HTTP Request.
HttpReq.Send();

So that easy with ActiveX but it's not really what you want (i gave you the example as illustration). So with the windows API, WinHTTP enables you to select and send a certificate from a local certificate store. The following code example shows how to open a certificate store and locate a certificate based on subject name after the ERROR_WINHTTP_CLIENT_AUTH_CERT_NEEDED error has been returned.
if( !WinHttpReceiveResponse( hRequest, NULL ) )
  {
    if( GetLastError( ) == ERROR_WINHTTP_CLIENT_AUTH_CERT_NEEDED )
    {
      //MY is the store the certificate is in.
      hMyStore = CertOpenSystemStore( 0, TEXT(""MY"") );
      if( hMyStore )
      {
        pCertContext = CertFindCertificateInStore( hMyStore,
             X509_ASN_ENCODING | PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING,
             0,
             CERT_FIND_SUBJECT_STR,
             (LPVOID) szCertName, //Subject string in the certificate.
             NULL );
        if( pCertContext )
        {
          WinHttpSetOption( hRequest, 
                            WINHTTP_OPTION_CLIENT_CERT_CONTEXT,
                            (LPVOID) pCertContext, 
                            sizeof(CERT_CONTEXT) );
          CertFreeCertificateContext( pCertContext );
        }
        CertCloseStore( hMyStore, 0 );

        // NOTE: Application should now resend the request.
      }
    }
  }

Encryption of buffer (buffer pointer is passed in as a LONG and the first twelve bytes are used for encrypted/unencrypted data lengths):
DWORD ret = 0;

memcpy((void *)((LONG)passedbufferptr+8),(void *)&count,4);

return ret;

Decryption of data:
DWORD ret = 0;
DWORD count;
memcpy((void *)&count,(void *)((LONG)passedbufferptr+8),4);

ret = CryptDecrypt(pubenckey,NULL,TRUE,0,(BYTE *)((LONG)passedbufferptr+12),&count);
if (ret == FALSE) {
    return GetLastError();
}

return ret;

The last code block consistently returns -2146893819 (NTE_BAD_DATA). Upon inspection of the buffer, however, it is decrypted.
It is important to note, that I pass in buffers with data amounts that are multiples of 32, and that doesn't change the result.
Thanks for any help you may have!

","RSA isn't meant to be used that way.  It really isn't a block cipher (or a stream cipher, for that matter).    Its my understanding that it really doesn't have any cryptological use except for a single ""short"" message, so it doesn't surprise me that the library fails after one decrypt from a key.
If you need to protect an arbitrary size of data, use RSA to exchange a symmetric key for a stream or block cipher (like AES).

Some of these files contain content encrypted with RC4 encryption using MS CryptoAPI.  I have thus far been unable to successfully decrypt the content using other crypto libraries.  After some experimentation, it appears that CryptoAPI's RC4 output is ""correct"" (i.e. agrees with other libraries) when the key is ASCII, but is ""wrong"" (differs from other libraries that all agree) when the key is not ASCII (e.g. a hash of a password).
Since all the content I'm interested in consuming was encrypted with a key that was derived from a password via hashing, I'm a bit stuck at the moment.  I've written up a small test to show the issue that includes 3 test cases as you can see below in the code.  Botan (C++) and CryptoJS (JS) always agree on output. MS CryptoAPI, however, only agrees for the ASCII keys.
Before I go to MS with this issue, is anyone aware of something I'm misunderstanding or doing wrong that could cause this issue?
Also, I apologize for my atrocious javascript.

","I just wanted to follow up with the answer I found in case this is useful to someone else in the future.
First and foremost, the answer was to RTFM! As it turns out, by default, CryptDeriveKey adds a ""salt"" to 40-bit symmetric keys consisting of all 0's. When I looked at our old CryptoAPI code and saw that we weren't passing any flags into it, I assumed this meant nothing special was going on and I didn't read through the details of all possible flags on MSDN. Furthermore, since MS considers this portion of the key a salt it is not included when you export the key so that was also a dead end.
I eventually found my way to http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa387695(v=vs.85).aspx which explains the salt mechanism for 40-bit keys and the line that caught my eye was that, for compatibility, you should create keys with the CRYPT_NO_SALT flag.  In our case, we already have encrypted content with such keys, so we simply modified our Botan/CryptoJS code to append 11 bytes of 0s to the end of the base 40-bit key.
The details for the various CryptDeriveKey flags can be found here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa379916(v=vs.85).aspx

Any thoughts/ideas on this?
*Interestingly, I have managed to get a complete Diffie Hellman Key Exchange to work, i.e. successfully agreeing the same secret (s1) between two parties. But this is with pre-defined P and G parameters. I'm re-working the code because something didn't seem to be correct as the derived secret was the same for every key exchange, implying that X was consistent. (i.e. Bob and Alice agreed on s1 every single time!?) - Here I, again, had an issue with CryptGetKeyParam as I was unable to determine the size of the session key when using KP_KEYLEN?!
*
","Ah ha!
It was a combination of the context flags and the overloaded method... Works now!
When P & G are NOT predefined, then don't set the CRYPT_PREGEN flag... And only one of the two overloaded methods was needed (this one):

HCERTSTORE hFileStoreHandle = CertOpenStore( 
CERT_STORE_PROV_FILENAME,
PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING | X509_ASN_ENCODING, NULL,
(CERT_STORE_OPEN_EXISTING_FLAG | CERT_STORE_READONLY_FLAG),
L""certificate-chain.pem.cert"");

Then I figured I can iterate through the store and get PCCERT_CONTEXT struct of certificates:
PCCERT_CONTEXT CAfileContext = NULL;
while(CAfileContext = CertEnumCertificatesInStore(
 hCertStore,
 CAfileContext)) {

    //start verification here
}

I don't know if I am on the right track or not but I'm facing two major problems here.
First is I don't know how to get the received certificate from buffer and convert it to a proper struct in order to validate its signature with certificate-chain file.
Second is I don't know how to verify a certificate signature using the CA chain file.
I'll appreciate all the suggestions and helps.

","The method you are using pops up a dialog to allow you to view and select certificates to use. A service cannot usually have a user interface (since they run outside of an interactive user session). I believe you can have interactive services but I wouldn't recommend it in this case. Use another way of selecting the certificate, perhaps based on the thumbprint of the required certificate e.g. How to get X509Certificate from certificate store and generate xml signature data?

EDIT - I can't see anything wrong with your declare or call

The only alternative I've seen is to change byte Pointer to be declared as ByVal pSignature Long and then calling it using varPtr(abSig(0)
But your code looks fine - I'm puzzled



Your declare doesn't match Microsoft API declaration. Not sure if that's by design because Signature is a byte pointer 
According to docs 
LPBYTE, BYTE  will be : *   ByRef Byte

Change this (by default arguments are passed ByVal)
pbSignature As Byte

To this
ByRef pbSignature As Byte

","After much frustration and fruitless research I've eventually discovered what the problem was. Along the way I discovered that the problem originated in another part of the code altogether. I also discovered that the problem manifested itself on Windows 10 32 bit as well - so not a 64 bit problem.
An incorrectly populated dwflags argument to an earlier call to CryptImportKey didn't seem to prevent the call to CryptVerifySignature succeeding under Vista 32 bit, even though the call to CryptImportKey, on investigation, had failed. Once the dwflags argument of CryptImportKey was corrected, to CRYPT_EXPORTABLE Or CRYPT_NO_SALT, it succeeded and the subsequent call to CryptVerifySignature succeeded under all alternative operating system / bit number combinations I was able to test.
Apologies and thanks in equal measure to all those who have sought to help in this matter. Until the next time.

","x >> 4 shifts x right four bits. x & 0xf does a bitwise and between x and 0xf. 0xf has its four least significant bits set, and all the other bits clear.
Assuming rgbHash is an array of unsigned char, this means the first expression retains only the four most significant bits and the second expression the four least significant bits of the (presumably) 8-bit input.
Four bits is exactly what will fit in one hexadecimal digit, so each of those is used to look up a hexadecimal digit in an array which presumably looks something like this:
char rgbDigits[] = ""0123456789abcdef""; // or possibly upper-case letters

","this code uses simple bit 'filtering' techniques

"">> 4"" means shift right by 4 places, which in turn means 'divide by 16' 
""& 0xf"" equals to bit AND operation which means 'take first 4 bits'

","Unfortunately not; at least, not without some architectural changes.
You can enable/disable FIPS mode by setting a registry value:
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\FIPSAlgorithmPolicy\Enabled (DWORD)

0 is disabled, 1 is enabled
However, there are some limitations: once you load the cryptographic providers into your process, it ""remembers"" the state of that FIPS mode for the rest of the process' lifetime. So code like this would work:
(NOTE: both cases assume that FIPS mode is off at the beginning)

    using (RegistryKey fipsAlgorithmPolicy = Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey(@""System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\FIPSAlgorithmPolicy"", true))

    }
    SHA1 sha = new SHA1Managed(); // throws, which is what you want
}

But code like this would not:
static void Main(string[] args)
{

In order for your code to reflect the new state, you'd have to restart your process. With that being said, what you could do is sequester the code that performs the cryptographic routines into a ""helper"" process that your application spawns after setting FIPS mode. It'd be a bit of a pain to implement, but it would allow you to toggle FIPS mode and have your code behave as expected.

Into CERT_CONTEXT you can find infos about standard certicate type of encoding used (X509_ASN_ENCODING or PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING).
Into CERT_INFO you can find CRYPT_ALGORITHM_IDENTIFIER and other more detailed infos.
For a documentation about CryptVerifyDetachedMessageSignature apis and related structures:

CryptVerifyDetachedMessageSignature

CERT_INFO

EDIT:
Digital signature system generally works creating an hash of the data to sign (SHA1 minimum level older certificates standard, now newer certicates start from a level of SHA256..), then this hash get encrypted with a private key using an algorithm of asymmetric cryptography (RSA). 
When the message is received, it get decrypted with the public key contained in the certificate released publicly, and then the date get hashed with the right algorithm, declared in the certificate (from programmatically point of view, see the struct fields upon) and if the two hashes (one in the same certificate that goes with the data, and the other calculated on the client who verify the digital signature) correspond, then it is verified that the data are not corrupted or changed by someone other than the author, and if the certificate it is released by a valid certification authority, then the author is also identified in a sure manner.

So far, so good. Then I'm tring to encrypt a plaintext

    char* plaintext = ""123456"";
LPBYTE pEncryptedData = NULL;
DWORD EncryptedDataLen = 0;

LPBYTE pEncryptedDataRev = NULL; /* I'll explain this later (: */
DWORD EncryptedDataRevLen = 0;

pEncryptedData = (LPBYTE) LocalAlloc(0, 500);
EncryptedDataLen = 6;


pEncryptedDataRev = (LPBYTE) LocalAlloc(0, 500);
EncryptedDataLen = 6;


CopyMemory(pEncryptedData, plaintext, 6);


if ( CryptEncrypt( hKey, NULL, TRUE, 0, pEncryptedData, &EncryptedDataLen, 500) ) {
    DWORD dwBytesWritten = 0;

    hFile = CreateFile(L""poc_enc"",              // name of the write
                       GENERIC_WRITE,          // open for writing
                       0,                      // do not share
                       NULL,                   // default security
                       CREATE_NEW,             // create new file only
                       FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL,  // normal file
                       NULL);                  // no attr. template

    ReverseStream(pEncryptedData, pEncryptedDataRev, EncryptedDataLen);

    WriteFile( 
                    hFile,           // open file handle
                    pEncryptedData,      // start of data to write
                    EncryptedDataLen,  // number of bytes to write
                    &dwBytesWritten, // number of bytes that were written
                    NULL);            // no overlapped structure

      CloseHandle(hFile); 
} 

You can see that, I'm reversing the encrypted data with ReverseStrem(), that is because, that I've read that the endiannes which CAPI and OpenSSL use differ. (little-endian CAPI, and big-endian OpenSSL)
void ReverseStream(LPBYTE Source, LPBYTE Destination, DWORD Size)
{
    DWORD cnt = Size;
    while(0<cnt)
    {
        Destination[Size-cnt] = Source[cnt];
        cnt--;
    }
}


OK, Now the troubles come. The encrypted plaintext (123456) is written to a file named poc_enc, and when I try to decrypt it with OpenSSL

openssl rsautl -decrypt   -in poc_enc -out plaintext -inkey private.pem
and I'm getting the following error:

    RSA operation error

Any ideas how can I fix this issue? Thanks :)
","The reverse function is wrong, this way you miss the last byte, it should be something like this:
void ReverseStream(LPBYTE Source, LPBYTE Destination, DWORD Size)
{
    int SourceCnt = Size;
    int DestCnt = 0;

    for (SourceCnt = Size - 1, DestCnt = 0; SourceCnt >= 0; SourceCnt--, DestCnt++)
        Destination[DestCnt] = Source[SourceCnt];

https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control?hl=en#signing-code-csharp
I'm using the code sample. With the same service account|key, bucket and object, the Java code and the C# code (on Windows) work. When I try the C# code on Mono/Linux, it does not work. The error is:
Code: SignatureDoesNotMatch
Message: The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your Google secret key and signing method.

Injecting some debugging code corroborates this error.
Here's the augmented method that does the signing:
private String signString(String stringToSign)  {
    if (key == null) throw new Exception(""Certificate not initialized"");
    CspParameters cp = new CspParameters(
        24,
        ""Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider"",
        ((RSACryptoServiceProvider)key.PrivateKey).CspKeyContainerInfo.KeyContainerName
        );
    RSACryptoServiceProvider provider = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(cp);
    byte[] buffer = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(stringToSign);
    byte[] rawSignature = provider.SignData(buffer, CryptoConfig.MapNameToOID(""SHA256""));
    Console.WriteLine (""signature == "");
    Console.WriteLine (BitConverter.ToString(rawSignature).Replace(""-"", string.Empty));
    return Convert.ToBase64String(rawSignature);
}

I expect (perhaps incorrectly that) repeated calls to signString with the same string value, would return the same rawSignature and result. On Java and Windows, this is true. On Mono, the value changes
String testString=""helloworld"";
Console.WriteLine(""Signing '"" + testString + ""' == "" + this.signString(testString));
Console.WriteLine(""Signing '"" + testString + ""' == "" + this.signString(testString));
Console.WriteLine(""Signing '"" + testString + ""' == "" + this.signString(testString));

returns, abbreviated results:

With Java, a similar test using the Google sample returns:

rawSignature ==

What am I doing wrong?
","I've managed to get consistent results by not using CspParameters at all, but using the PrivateKey property of X509Certificate2. My current ""portable"" implementation unfortunately requires a cast which makes me nervous, but it does appear to give the same results on Windows and Linux (under Mono 4.0.2), and those are the same results as the original sample code. Here's a short test app which works under Mono:
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;
using System.Text;

public class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var key = new X509Certificate2(""key.p12"", ""notasecret"");
        byte[] buffer = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(""test string"");
        // This is the slightly dodgy bit...
        var rsa = (RSACryptoServiceProvider) key.PrivateKey;
        byte[] signature = rsa.SignData(buffer, ""SHA256"");
        Console.WriteLine(Convert.ToBase64String(signature));
    }
}

As noted in comments, this doesn't work under .NET, for unknown reasons :(
Now I haven't tried using this to make any Cloud Storage requests yet, but I expect it would work.
On more modern platforms, you can use the fact that RSA has a SignData method, and use the GetPrivateRSAKey() extension method to get an RSA instance:
var rsa = key.GetRSAPrivateKey();
var signature = rsa.SignData(
   buffer, HashAlgorithmName.SHA256, RSASignaturePadding.Pkcs1);

You may be able to use this on Mono too depending on which version you target.

"27857616","CryptAcquireContext failing with ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND (2L) when user not logged on Windows 8.1","I am having a hard time migrating a C++ CryptoAPI-based application that currently runs on Windows Server 2008 to Windows 8.1. The scenario is:
This application is eventually triggered by WatchDog.exe, which in its turn is triggered when the computer is started by Windows' Task Scheduler.
Task Scheduler uses the following rules to start the WatchDog.exe:

A Administrator User Account;
Run Whether user is logged on or not;
UNCHECKED: Do not store password. The task will only have access to
local resources;
Run with Highest Privileges;
Configure for Win 8.1;
Triggered at system startup.

The server sits there, nobody logged, until in a given scenario WatchDog.exe starts the application. Application log confirms that the owner of the process (GetUserName) is the very same user Task Scheduler used to trigger WatchDog.exe.
It turns out that this application works fine in Windows Server 2008, but in windows 8.1 a call to CryptAcquireContext fails with return code ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND (2L). The odd thing is that the application will NOT fail if, when started, the user is physically logged onthe machine, although it was not the user who started the application manually.
I took a look at the documentation and found:

""The profile of the user is not loaded and cannot be found. This
  happens when the application impersonates a user, for example, the
  IUSR_ComputerName account.""

I had never heard of impersonification, so I made a research and found the APIs LogonUser, ImpersonateLoggedOnUser and RevertToSelf. I then updated the application in this way:
...
HANDLE hToken;
if (! LogonUser(L""admin"", L""."", L""XXXXXXXX"", LOGON32_LOGON_BATCH, LOGON32_PROVIDER_DEFAULT, &hToken))
{
    logger->log (_T(""Error logging on.""));
}
else
{
    logger->log (PMLOG_LEVEL_TRACE, _T(""Logged on.""));
    if (! ImpersonateLoggedOnUser(hToken))
    {
        logger->log (_T(""Error impersonating.""));
    }
    else
    {
        logger->log (_T(""Impersonated.""));
        err = XXXXXXXXX(); // calls function which will execute CryptAcquireContext 
        if (! RevertToSelf())
        {
            logger->log (_T(""Error reverting.""));
        }
        else
        {
            logger->log (_T(""Reverted.""));
        }
    }
}
...

Excerpt with the call to CryptAcquireContext:
...
//---------------------------------------------------------------
// Get the handle to the default provider. 
if(! CryptAcquireContext(&hCryptProv, cryptContainerName, MS_ENHANCED_PROV, PROV_RSA_FULL, 0))
{
    DWORD e = GetLastError();
    _stprintf_s (logMsg, 1000, _T(""Error %ld acquiring cryptographic provider.""), e);
    cRSALogger->log (logMsg);
    return ERR_CCRYPT_NO_KEY_CONTAINER;
}
cRSALogger->log (_T(""Cryptographic provider acquired.""));
...

As the result, I got the log:
...

...

...

That seems to show that impersonation is working properly, but still I get Error 2 (ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND) on CryptAcquireContext.
Summary:

On Windows Server 2008, the very same application runs properly even
without the calls to LogonUser/Impersonate/Revert.
On Windows 8.1, the application, with or without the calls to
LogonUser/Impersonate/Revert, will only work properly if the user is logged on (which is not acceptable).

Any thoughts where I can run to in order to get this working on windows 8.1?
Thank in advance,

"21341837","Mutual SSL authentication with CAPI and OpenSSL","I need to do mutual SSL authentication from my client app (C++) using OpenSSL (via libcurl). I am reading certs from a smart card via MS Crypto API (CAPI) and ActivClient driver, and doing cert-chain validation with CAPI (this seemed to be easier validating the cert chain with OpenSSL since the cert chain is in the MS cert store). I can convert the client cert from CAPI to OpenSSL, but I'm having problems with the private key.
It seems that, for the server to validate my client's cert, I need to expose the client cert private key to OpenSSL. It's not quite clear how I should do that, or even if I can do that (it may depend on whether the key is marked as ""exportable"" in the cert). I can try following the suggestions in Converting private key in windows store to PEM (for OpenSSL), and hope the key is exportable, but I wonder whether I am even going down the correct path.
I've searched quite a bit on this topic, but haven't found any conclusive info.
Any advice and/or suggestions are appreciated!!

openssl speed -evp aes-256-cbc -engine cryptodev

I get good speedup and I can see the interrupts to the CAAM increasing rapidly in /proc/interrupts.
However I need to use the encryption in an application so I utilize the OpenSSL API functions for envelope encryption:
 int EVP_SealInit(EVP_CIPHER_CTX *ctx, const EVP_CIPHER *type, unsigned char **ek, int *ekl, unsigned char *iv, EVP_PKEY **pubk, int npubk);

 int EVP_SealUpdate(EVP_CIPHER_CTX *ctx, unsigned char *out, int *outl, unsigned char *in, int inl);

 int EVP_SealFinal(EVP_CIPHER_CTX *ctx, unsigned char *out,
             int *outl);

passing EVP_aes_256_cbc() as the const EVP_CIPHER *type.
Here I do not get any speedup and I also do not see the interrupts to the CAAM increasing in /proc/interrupts. Could anyone please guide me about what is wrong in this scenario? Why is the API call not utilizing the CAAM engine while the ""openssl speed"" benchmark is working fine?

"22063310","Adding authenticated attributes using MS CryptoApi","I'm struggling adding authenticated attributes (OCSP data) to my message using CryptoApi. I first used CryptoApi's simplified message functions, but now switch to the low-level message functions, thinking that I would be able to control the message structure better. But I am once again stuck. My process is as follows:

Initialize CMSG_SIGNER_ENCODE_INFO and CMSG_SIGNED_ENCODE_INFO structure
I create a CRYPT_ATTRIBUTE for the ocsp date and specifies it in the CMSG_SIGNER_ENCODE_INFO structure
I then call CryptMsgCalculateEncodedLength to get the size
CryptMsgOpenToEncode with CMSG_SIGNED as the message type
CryptMsgUpdate, to insert my content into the message
CryptMsgGetParam with CMSG_CONTENT_PARAM to get the encoded blob
CryptMsgClose, I'm done with the message for now.

I open the message again to get the CMSG_ENCRYPTED_DIGEST, which is sent to a TSA and the result is added as an unaunthenticated attribute using CryptMsgControl.
I'm using this to sign signature tags in Adobe. So when there is no authenticated attributes, I receive three green check from Adobe:

The document has not been modified...
The document is signed by the current user
The signature includes an embedded timestamp (and the timestamp is validate)

But as soon as the authenticated attribute is added the signer's identity is invalidated and the timestamp data in incorrect. The CMSG_COMPUTED_HASH_PARAM when authenticated attributes are added and when not, differs. Should this not be the same? Since the document digest is of the content of the document and not of the authenticated attribute.
Is there another way to add authenticated attributes? I've tried to add it as a signer using CryptMsgControl, but that did not help either...
","how about this step on adding the authenticated attributes for signing, example time stamping,
CryptEncodeObject(PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING, szOID_RSA_signingTime, &curtime, pTime, &szTime);
pTime = (BYTE *)LocalAlloc(GPTR, szTime);
CryptEncodeObject(PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING, szOID_RSA_signingTime, &curtime, pTime, &szTime);
time_blob.cbData = szTime;
time_blob.pbData = pTime;
attrib[0].pszObjId = szOID_RSA_signingTime;
attrib[0].cValue = 1;
attrib[0].rgValue = &time_blob;

","It looks like before encrypting or decrypting, you're generating a random key with CryptGenKey. This means that you will use a different key for encryption and decryption, so your file will not decrypt correctly.
You will need to use the same key for encryption or decryption. Either by exporting and importing the key, or possibly by using CryptDeriveKey to derive the key from a shared password.

"12789436","How to programmatically update subversion password on local machine?","I am building a small internal tool for use with the developers in my company. One of the small goals is to update multiple locations when we change our passwords. One of these locations that needs to be updated is subversion. Most of the developers use TortoiseSvn but not all do (so I'd prefer a program neutral solution but it's not a requirement). 
From my research around this topic, my first impression was that Tortoise or another application would have a change password function that I could use. This isn't so from what I can find. So my next thought was to change the encrypted password that is stored in %APPDATA%\Subversion\auth\svn.simple. This way, we could bypass any program and just fix the local machine credentials and be on our merry way.
For a Windows machine, subversion uses the wincrypt password-store for encryption. Working with that code was fairly straight forward. I found this DPAPI (from Obviex) code that would work to handle the encryption for me. It just takes care of the details for me (small note: I had some small issues with System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData so I decided to stick with this other way).
With this code, I was able to decrypt the password from the svn.simple folder and find that it worked (Previously saved authentication was decrypted and turned up the right password). However, when I would encrypt the password and store it in the proper place, I will always get a login screen from TortoiseSvn. It doesn't like my encrypted password. 
So what's my question... has anyone accomplished something similar to what I am trying to do? Should I just forget trying to update the subversion password? Should I force a checkout of a repository and provide the credentials (I can do this using SharpSvn) and then delete the repository once it finishes?
Guess I am just hoping to find that someone has solved this problem already and can point me in the right direction. Please let me know if you have questions. 
Other noteworthy links:

Stackoverflow question on extracting TortoiseSVN password
TortoiseSVN Password Decrypter - Used this for parsing the files within svn.simple. Small changes were made for applying the new encrypted password to the existing svn authentication files.

","I know this is a completely different direction than you were asking but in the right circumstance, it achieves your goal...
If you are using Active Directory to manage your users and you are willing to switch your SVN server applications, you should consider VisualSVN server.  It has support for authentication against LDAP and it uses the user's SID in the authz file so user name and password changes are transparent.  Plus it's free for commercial use.

I believe that I can complete the Diffie-Hellman key exchange in Python, as I can generate the same public and private keys without error. I've based my Diffie-Hellman key exchange on this repository.
I haven't been able to test this, however as I can't seem to get the shared secret exported from the C++ code (similar to this thread, that was never satisfactorily answered). I can however get the RC4 session key with the following code:
// Get the key length
DWORD keylen;
CryptExportKey(   
    hSessionKey1,
    NULL,    
    PLAINTEXTKEYBLOB,
    0,
    NULL,
    &keylen);

// Get the session key
CryptExportKey(   
    hSessionKey1,
    NULL,     
    PLAINTEXTKEYBLOB,   
    0,  
    encKey,    
    &keylen);

The output from this function gets me:
08 02 00 00 01 68 00 00 10 00 00 00 75 2c 59 8c 6e e0 8c 9f ed 30 17 7e 9d a5 85 2b

I know there is a 12 byte header+length on this, so that leaves me with the following 16 byte RC4 session key:
75 2c 59 8c 6e e0 8c 9f ed 30 17 7e 9d a5 85 2b

So I am currently trying to validate that I can encrypt the same plaintext using the RC4 that I have acquired from the CryptExportKey. I am currently trying to encrypt g_rgbData from the C++ code above, which is set to:
BYTE g_rgbData[] = {0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08};

With the C++ code I get the following encrypted output:
cc 94 aa ec 86 6e a8 26

Using pycrypto I have the following code:
from Crypto.Cipher import ARC4
key = '75 2c 59 8c 6e e0 8c 9f ed 30 17 7e 9d a5 85 2b'
key = key.replace(' ', '').decode('hex')

plaintext = '0102030405060708'
plaintext = plaintext.replace(' ', '').decode('hex')

rc4 = ARC4.new(key)
encrypted = rc4.encrypt(plaintext)

print encrypted.encode('hex')

This results in the following output:
00 5b 64 25 4e a5 62 e3

Which doesn't match the C++ output. I've played around with endianess, but I suspect something else might be going on. 
Sorry if this is long winded, but it brings me to my two questions:

Whenever you transition from the shared key to RC4 (using CryptSetKeyParam with CALG_RC4), what is actually going on under the hood here? I can't seem to find any information about this process anywhere so that I can implement it in Python.
Any idea why my RC4 will not work with the same key and the same plaintext in Python?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
","According to the PyCrypto docs your key must be minimum 40 bytes:

key (byte string) - The secret key to use in the symmetric cipher. It can have any length, with a minimum of 40 bytes. Its cryptograpic strength is always capped to 2048 bits (256 bytes).

but then there is a contradiction just above:

key_size = xrange(1, 257)
Size of a key (in bytes)

allowing key-lengths to be from 1-256, so I'm not sure if this even helps.

I believe that I can complete the Diffie-Hellman key exchange in Python, as I can generate the same public and private keys without error. I've based my Diffie-Hellman key exchange on this repository.
I haven't been able to test this, however as I can't seem to get the shared secret exported from the C++ code (similar to this thread, that was never satisfactorily answered). I can however get the RC4 session key with the following code:
// Get the key length
DWORD keylen;
CryptExportKey(   
    hSessionKey1,
    NULL,    
    PLAINTEXTKEYBLOB,
    0,
    NULL,
    &keylen);

// Get the session key
CryptExportKey(   
    hSessionKey1,
    NULL,     
    PLAINTEXTKEYBLOB,   
    0,  
    encKey,    
    &keylen);

The output from this function gets me:
08 02 00 00 01 68 00 00 10 00 00 00 75 2c 59 8c 6e e0 8c 9f ed 30 17 7e 9d a5 85 2b

I know there is a 12 byte header+length on this, so that leaves me with the following 16 byte RC4 session key:
75 2c 59 8c 6e e0 8c 9f ed 30 17 7e 9d a5 85 2b

So I am currently trying to validate that I can encrypt the same plaintext using the RC4 that I have acquired from the CryptExportKey. I am currently trying to encrypt g_rgbData from the C++ code above, which is set to:
BYTE g_rgbData[] = {0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08};

With the C++ code I get the following encrypted output:
cc 94 aa ec 86 6e a8 26

Using pycrypto I have the following code:
from Crypto.Cipher import ARC4
key = '75 2c 59 8c 6e e0 8c 9f ed 30 17 7e 9d a5 85 2b'
key = key.replace(' ', '').decode('hex')

plaintext = '0102030405060708'
plaintext = plaintext.replace(' ', '').decode('hex')

rc4 = ARC4.new(key)
encrypted = rc4.encrypt(plaintext)

print encrypted.encode('hex')

This results in the following output:
00 5b 64 25 4e a5 62 e3

Which doesn't match the C++ output. I've played around with endianess, but I suspect something else might be going on. 
Sorry if this is long winded, but it brings me to my two questions:

Whenever you transition from the shared key to RC4 (using CryptSetKeyParam with CALG_RC4), what is actually going on under the hood here? I can't seem to find any information about this process anywhere so that I can implement it in Python.
Any idea why my RC4 will not work with the same key and the same plaintext in Python?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
","Finally had some time to look over your code. When I run your code locally, I am able to export the session key and can use it successfully in pycrypto. My guess is that you are either not exporting the session key correctly (e.g. is what you posted what you are running?) or the data you are encrypting in C++ is not the same data that you are encrypting in Python - double check that the data you are encrypting is also correct. I suspect that it's probably the latter, as there isn't really much you can screw up with the CryptExportKey you've posted.

","Probably you are not exporting the key, just using the CSP containing the key, while you are in the same computer, the key is stored in the container where you ""link"" by using the cryptoapi. Once you go to other computer the container is not present, so you can not use the key.
Make sure that the Private Key is exportable.

","There is a specific page on MSDN that explains how to import plain text keys. It uses CryptImportKey directly, but you may have a different configuration or context, so try and match it against the example.
It also tells you that it uses PLAINTEXTKEYBLOB but as I did not see any code reference to it, I'm not sure that this is true. The example is for a DES key.

The problem is that len is returning a value that does not match the entire decoded string. What could be the problem ?
","When you say ""string"", I assume you mean a zero-terminated textual string.  The encryption process is dependent on a cipher block size, and oftentimes padding.  What's actually being encoded and decoded is up to the application... it's all binary data to the cipher.  If you're textual string is smaller than what's returned from the decrypt process, your application needs to determine the useful part.  So for example if you KNOW your string inside the results is zero-terminated, you can get the length doing a simple strlen.  That's risky of course if you can't guarantee the input... probably better off searching the results for a null up to the decoded length...

","If you are using cipher in ECB, CBC or some other chaining modes, you must pad plain text to the length, which is multiple of cipher block length. You can see a PKCS#5 standard for example. High-level functions like in OpenSSL can perform padding transparently for programmer. So, encrypted text can be larger than plain text up to additional cipher block size.

"21701571","ECDSA signing and verification in windows and linux","This is continuation of my previous post (Understanding BCryptSignHash output signature).
Let me clearly state my problem:

I need to sign a data in windows application level.
I need to verify the same in linux application level and windows driver (that i have wrote).

I tried following:

Using CryptoAPI, i was able to sign in windows application level and verify in the windows driver. In linux, i tried to use simpleECDSA (http://jonasfj.dk/blog/2007/12/simpleecdsa-a-simple-implementation-of-ecdsa-in-c/) to verify the signature (generated using cryptoAPI). I was able to convert the binary key blobs from cryptoAPI in simpleECDSA but could not interpret the signature.
Using Crypto++ library, i was able to sign in windows application level and verify in linux application level but could not use the same to verify in windows driver.

Kindly let me know if there is a library available or a way that i could use the same public/private key and signature across windows application/driver and linux.
Am new to cryptography hence forgive my naiveness.
Thanks,

"20648110","How to determine which personal certificate comes from hardware device in C#?","Assuming I have multiple personal certificates for current user. But only one certificate belongs to Aladdin eToken.
I want to determine which certificate belongs to Aladdin eToken.
Should I use X509Store and X509Crtificate for this?
Should I try eToken SDK?
","This depends on how Aladdin eToken signs certificates. If it issues an X509 Certificate with the Issuer field set to something identifiable (e.g. Aladdin eToken) then you should be able to find the certificate that way.
// Get the MY store for the current user
X509Store store = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.CurrentUser);

store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);

X509Certificate2Collection certs = 
    store.Certificates.Find(X509FindType.FindByIssuerName,
                            ""Aladdin eToken"");

That should get you all certificates which have the string ""Aladdin eToken"" in the issuer name. If you need to use different criteria to identify the certificate, there are heaps of other valid arguments you can pass the Find method of the Certificates collection to get matches.
For example, if you're looking for a specific certificate, you can FindByThumbprint or FindBySerialNumber.

"28777582","Reading Certificate Data from Signed Executables with Multiple Signatures","Microsoft is moving away from SHA1. As a result many executables now have two or more signatures; one using a SHA1 digest for backward compatibility and one using a SHA256.
For example if you look at the properties of vstest.executionengine.exe from Visual Studio 2013 (look at the properties on Windows 8 or Server 2012) you'll see it has 3 different signatures from 3 different certificates.
I already have code that uses a combination of CryptQueryObject, CryptMsgGetParam, and .NET SignedCms, but it only sees 1 of the 3 signatures. There appears to be only one message with one signer.
I need to get the certificate information for all signatures. How are multiple signatures modeled - is it multiple messages, or multiple signers in a single message? Did Microsoft add new APIs or new flags to access multiple signatures?
","It turns out that Microsoft (sort of) hides subsequent signatures.  When adding another signature, the entire CMS structure is added as an unsigned attribute.
So for example a dual-signed Authenticode signature decoded as a .NET SignedCms will have one signer, and that SignerInfo will have a value in UnsignedAttributes.  If you take the attribute ASN RawData value and pass it to SignedCms.Decode, you get the second signature.
// decode inner signature    
signedCms2.Decode(signedCms1.SignerInfos[0].UnsignedAttributes[0].Values[0].RawData);

It also appears that instead of adding another attribute to the root signature signer, the attribute is added in the inner-most signers attributes.
Also note that not all attributes are inner signatures, I think you need to check for a proper Oid on the attribute.
Is suspect that this was the best way for Microsoft to keep backward compatibility.

","You are not specifying the encryption mode.  Use CBC or CTR.  Do not use ECD as it is insecure.  You are specifying a null IV.  That may mean that the system is supplying a random (or zero) IV.  Much better to specify an IV explicitly, and to ensure that the same IV is use for both encryption and decryption.
Another common source of errors is trying to treat bytes as character data (and vice versa).  Be sure to treat bytes as bytes and characters as characters and know which one you are dealing with at all times.

","The CSP blob format is proprietary to Microsoft and poorly documented. Rather than use that format I would instead use the ExportParameters method to get an RSAParameters struct. From this struct I would directly access the Exponent and Modulus byte arrays and base64 encode them for transfer to the python program, as in the following snippet:
var rsa = RSA.Create ();
var RsaParms = rsa.ExportParameters (false);
Console.WriteLine (Convert.ToBase64String( RsaParms.Modulus));
Console.WriteLine (Convert.ToBase64String (RsaParms.Exponent));

In the python program, the documentation for PyCrypto's RSA importKey mentions a few options for acceptable formats. The simplest of these is the PKCS#1 RSAPublicKey structure. This is quite easy to construct from the asn1 module, as in the following snippet:
mod_raw = b64decode('qLhDLGNh7+9xRahkaWILm5HcG3T0Q4SUoDA3bpQtqLxU3AQ/fmYQWLXh0Se1mhQ3AIMduVgKaJhK1sH+G/toXuQ0n5ENw6PtGMODwsDXF072kaBKD3JBZSESC9a9a8QDoGtv7WwvH1UcIE9di60C7YdBMlqqBgkjMQ6c3CTh9KU=')

","Warning : This is not the exact answer for your question, but i hope it will give you some help towards what you want to acheive
Based on my experience, Windows crypto APIs are designed to use the private key within the certificate store rather than export the key outside, unless you are using CryptoAPI standard functions like PFXExportCertStoreEx ().
CryptExportKey function gives the private/public key pair in a key blob structure which you have to convert to the format you want. The closest thing i have ever seen this being being done is in
Openssl engine for Windows, filename : e_capi.c
refer to the function
 **capi_load_privkey() and subfunction capi_get_pkey()**

Here conversion of the Key blob to OpenSSL compatible structure is done.
Hope this helps

","In order to make the certificates stored in your CSP usable by Office and other application for digital signature operations, you will need to register these certificate in Windows ""MY"" certificate store using CertAddEncodedCertificateToStore and then update the CERT_KEY_PROV_INFO_PROP_ID property of the resulting CERT_CONTEXT using CertSetCertificateContextProperty in order to indicate your CSP name and the container where the certificate's key resides.
I have written a small command line program that uses this method to load all certificates stored in a given CSP to the ""MY"" certificate store. It also offers the possibility to remove certificates from the ""MY"" certificate store, which is useful when the certificates are no more needed/available.

","I have same situation as you. 
My CSP work fine with test applications and MS Office 2007 but it's not work with MS Office 2010 and 2013. 
This is the MS Office's issue: 

Office 2010 does not support certain certificates in a Windows 7 or Windows Vista environment. Specifically, these unsupported certificates use private keys that are stored by a third-party cryptographic service provider (CSP). Therefore, an Office 2010 document cannot be signed by using a Cryptographic API (CAPI).

You can download Office 2010 hotfix package (Mso-x-none) here.
For MS Office 2013, It seems you need Service Pack 1.

"33919247","alloc_ahash vs alloc_shash in Linux Crypto Libraries","In the Linux CRYPTO libraries, what is the difference among:

crypto_alloc_hash(...); 
crypto_alloc_ahash(...);
crypto_alloc_shash(...);

I would guess 'a' stands for asynchronous and 's' for synchronous.
If this is the case, what does it mean in terms of implementation choice?
(I am trying to find the correct way to calculate an HMAC(SHA1) value while processing a TCP packet using the CRYPTO libraries).
","SO Question1 & SO Question2 are good starting points for you.
There are nothing called asynchronous and synchronous functions.All functions(callees) need to return to the callers.
But there are asynchronous and synchronous operations.
crypto_alloc_ahash() & crypto_alloc_shash() differ in that the
first consist of the asynchronous operations and the latter consist of
synchronous operations. 
In case of the first the function when called returns immediately to the main programme leaving behind its operations to complete. When the operations complete they usually use SIGNALS/INTERRUPTS to let the main programme know that they have completed. You can see the implementation here and an excerpt is given below.
struct crypto_ahash *crypto_alloc_ahash(const char *alg_name, u32 type,
                                        u32 mask)
 {
         return crypto_alloc_tfm(alg_name, &crypto_ahash_type, type, mask);
 }

In case of the latter the main programme(caller) has to wait for the operation in the function to complete to continue. I can't think of specific scenarios
where synchronization is mandatory in this context. You can see the implementation here
Indeed both the functions look the same but for the type of the values they return.
Async variants of functions is normally what you should look for the speed reasons of your programme. Also you cannot make async calls from sync variants for obvious reasons.
Edit :
crypto_alloc_hash is synchronous hash and I couldn't find out the difference between hash and shash.
Both returns allocated cipher handle in case of success; IS_ERR is true in case of an error, PTR_ERR returns the error code.
See shash vs hash.

In the case of OpenSSL, all the encoding/decoding (certificates or
passwords) is done transparently to the caller in the function
CMS_Encrypt, as it should be.
CAPI does the same thing in the case of
certificate based encryption inside the function CryptEncryptMessage
(no ASN details are revealed to the caller). After some googling, I found out the following key generation implementation. Now how am I supposed to use it in CAPI ?
Because CAPI does not
support PBE encryption at the high level (PBKDF2) my guess
is that the encoding has to be done (somehow?) manually. And by manually I mean writing
(and reading) the binary representations of various ASN tags. How am I supposed to do this ?
I cannot access the msasn1.h API since msasn1.lib is never distributed. Has anyone been able to use CAPI interface for doing anything else other than certificates based encryption ?

"40297283","How to get a HCRYPTKEY from X.509 certificate?","The certificate is obtained from a smart card via the BSI API (gscBsiPkiGetCertificate) and I'm trying to get the key handle to its public/private key pair to perform asymmetric crypto operations using the CryptoAPI's CryptEncrypt and CryptDecrypt functions.
What I've Tried
gscBsiPkiGetCertificate returns the raw certificate data in hex encoded form and I was able to decode it and successfully call CertCreateCertificateContext to get the CERT_CONTEXT structure. With this CERT_CONTEXT, I had tried CertGetCertificateContextProperty with parameters

CERT_KEY_CONTEXT_PROP_ID
CERT_KEY_PROV_HANDLE_PROP_ID
CERT_KEY_PROV_INFO_PROP_ID
CERT_HCRYPTPROV_OR_NCRYPT_KEY_HANDLE_PROP_ID
CERT_HCRYPTPROV_TRANSFER_PROP_ID

However all of them returned CRYPT_E_NOT_FOUND. I had also tried GetCryptProvFromCert in hope of getting the certificate container handle, which would then allow me to get the key handle via CryptGetUserKey. However GetCryptProvFromCert failed with error CRYPT_E_NO_KEY_PROPERTY. 
I am currently using pure CryptoAPI as a workaround: CryptAcquireContext to access card -> CryptGetProvParam to enumerate certificate containers -> CryptAcquireContext to access container -> CryptGetUserKey to get key handle. This is far from ideal since I've to interate through the containers to find the required certificate. gscBsiPkiGetCertificate allows me to specify an AID value to get the certificate directly.
I had also tried using CryptEncryptMessage which takes a PCCERT_CONTEXT directly and thus avoiding the need for the HCRYPTKEY. However, trying with algorithm identifiers szOID_RSA, szOID_RSA_ENCRPT, and szOID_RSA_DH all returned CRYPT_E_UNKNOWN_ALGO. I'm quite sure the certificate supports RSA encryption since calling CryptGetKeyParam with KP_ALGID on the key handle obtained through CryptoAPI returns me CALG_RSA_KEYX
Bonus Challenge
I am using BSI API to access both data and certificate containers within the card. I would like to avoid the workaround as I want to standardise all smart card operations to use only BSI or CryptoAPI. If it's impossible for me to get the key handle using BSI API, I would then like know how to use CryptoAPI to access the data containers. CryptGetProvParam only enumerates the certificate containers.
","you could try something like that 
1) you get the certificate context e.g. 
pSignerCertContext = CertFindCertificateInStore(hCertStore, PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING | X509_ASN_ENCODING, 0, CERT_FIND_HASH, &hashBlob, NULL)

2) you get a handle to crypt provider e.g. :
CryptAcquireContext(&hProv, strContainer.c_str(), strProvider.c_str(), PROV_RSA_FULL, CRYPT_SILENT)

3) You associate the certificate context with the crypt provider e.g. 
CertSetCertificateContextProperty(pSignerCertContext, CERT_SET_KEY_PROV_HANDLE_PROP_ID, 0, &hProv)

4) after this you can use either CryptAcquireCertificatePrivateKey or CryptGetUserKey

","Crypto++ is amazing in power, but suffers from its complexity and a lack of automation/documentation. It also suffers from a lack of debugging I think, when the check does not work, it just does not work, but you're given little hints as to what could cause the failure...
Anyway, since you are using C++, may I suggest Google Keyczar ?

It's meant to be easy to use, with safe defaults, yet allows customization.
It comes up with a complete Key Management system, which Crypto++ does not feature and which is complicated enough to code by oneself.
It's open source too, so the code can be audited.
It's portable even outside of the Windows environment.

I haven't, unfortunately, used it myself. I am currently stuck with Crypto++. But if I had the opportunity to choose right now, I think I'd invest time to experiment with Keyczar.

"38466999","X509Certificate constructor takes >6 seconds to execute for a particular user","I've developed a C#, .NET4.5.2 client/server system which uses TLS/SSL to communicate.  The certificates are loaded from a file.  I created the certificate files using 'MakeCert' utitilty to create a .pvk and .cer file then I combined them into a .pfx using 'pvk2pfx' utility.
To use the certificates I load them by using the X509Certificate2 constructor with the overload to pass in the file path and password as strings:
X509Certificate2(string filePath, string password)

I've noticed over time that the loading of certificates has become very slow.  I'm not sure if there was an 'event' that made them slow or if it has been gradual but it's now up to about 6 seconds to load the PFX file.  Loading the CER file is no problem and takes ~0.1 seconds.
I'm running Windows 8.1 and the problem is only for my user login on the laptop.
I wrote the following test app to verify the problem:
    private const string filePath = @""c:\testcert.pfx"";
    private const string password = ""testpassword"";
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var stopwatch = new Stopwatch();
        try
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""About to create certificate. Press Enter."");
            Console.ReadLine();

            stopwatch.Start();
            var cert = new X509Certificate(filePath, password);
            stopwatch.Stop();

            Console.WriteLine(stopwatch.Elapsed);
            Console.WriteLine(""Certificate created. About to reset.  Press Enter."");
            Console.ReadLine();

            cert.Reset();

            Console.WriteLine(""Certificate reset.  Press Enter."");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
        }
        Console.ReadLine();
    }

I asked some colleagues to run the program on their PCs.  I also tried running within a VM and then setting up a new user on my own laptop. In all cases it ran in ~0.1 seconds but for my normal user login it runs in >6 seconds.
At first I wasn't calling 'Reset()' on the certificate so thought perhaps there was a problem with some temporary files somewhere so I used procmon to find out what was happening.  I identified that some temporary files were being created in the following directory (although they got tidied up when the application exited even without the call to Reset()):
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\<SID>

Just to be sure I've tried deleting the files in this directory but it doesn't make any difference.
Using procmon I can see that there are 2 gaps in file/registry activity during the loading of the certificate which don't occur in a system where the load is fast.  First is just after it tries to use 'dpapi.dll'.  The second is after a read to the following 'C:\Extend\$UsnJrnl:$J:$DATA'.  DPAPI.dll is the interface for Windows Data Protection.  The latter file is the USN Journal for NTFS which records file changes.  I'm no expert on either and I'm not sure if either is relevant!
I've then tried using API Monitor  http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor to observe system calls.  Again I'm no expert but I trawled through to see what was happening just before the pauses.  There's a lot in there I don't understand that may or may not be relevant and I welcome comment on any of it to help focus in on the problem.
The last call before a 2 second gap is a memcpy with the following call stack:
#   Module  Address Offset  Location
1   RPCRT4.dll  0x74f6378b  0x2378b I_RpcSendReceive + 0x1bb
2   RPCRT4.dll  0x74f6367b  0x2367b I_RpcSendReceive + 0xab
3   RPCRT4.dll  0x74f594df  0x194df NdrServerInitializeNew + 0x83f

5   RPCRT4.dll  0x74f6398b  0x2398b NdrSendReceive + 0x2b

Higher up the potentially interesting lines seem to be:

I find it difficult to trace the callstack but I think these are ultimately coming from a function called CryptQueryObject.
I've found the following article which may be relevant but it's not Windows8.1.  I've deleted the %windir%\Temp folder just in case but also hasn't helped.
https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/931908
I remember finding an article somewhere that suggested a delay might be something to do with ActiveDirectory calls from CryptQueryObject but I can't find the link.   
I'm really looking for:

How to fix my user login so it doesn't take 6 seconds to load a certificate
How to ensure my code is OK so it doesn't happen again or to other people using the system

Thanks for any help.
","This issue has now resolved and I think I understand why!
When you load an X509Certificate with a private key, Windows stores the key to a file and encrypts the file using 'Data Protection' (hence the calls to DPAPI I had monitored). 
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc962112.aspx
The key used to encrypt the file is called a 'Master Key'.  It is based on your user login and gets renewed whenever you change your use password.  It also automatically expires after 90 days.
http://www.passcape.com/index.php?section=docsys&cmd=details&id=28#33
As described in the above link, the master key is stored in the following directory:
%APPDATA%/Microsoft/Protect/%SID%

I could see that my MasterKey was in fact older than 90 days by looking at the 'last modified' date on the files in that directory.  So, whenever I was loading a certificate, it was trying to store the private key in an encrypted file and noticed that the Master Key was out of date so it would then try and update it.
I reran ProcMon but stopped filtering for activity just from my test app.  I could then see that a number of UDP calls to our Active Directory server were being made during the 'gaps' by a process called lsass.exe which is to do with security and password updates (can't post another link due to stack overflow restrictions but easy to search for).
I think that the process of trying to update the master key must involve some interaction to the ActiveDirectory service.
I work remotely and connect to my work network via VPN.  The VPN does not allow access to the ActiveDirectory server so  I think the delays were caused by trying and failing to access that server.
I waited till my next visit to the office and as soon as I was connected to the network and could access the ActiveDirectory server then the delay in loading certificates disappeared.  I confirmed that my MasterKey files have also been updated and are no longer out of date.
I retested loading certificates while connected via the VPN and the delay is still gone so this does seem to confirm that it is OK as long as the Master Key isn't out of date.
Unfortunately, I couldn't change my password over the VPN due to the same problems of not being able to access the Active Directory service.
My problem solved.  I appreciate it was probably fairly unique but I hope the details of my investigation help somebody else at some point!

"40660426","How to stop Windows CryptoAPI to add private key to public-only cert upon decryption","I'm trying to test S/MIME decryption but CryptDecryptMessage function in decryption mode keeps working even if the certificate in Personal store is public-only (while private key is needed for decryption). Magically, the certificate turns into private+public certificate after this function is called.
Initially, I had full certificate in my Personal store and everything was working fine. Then, I had to test what would happen if someone tried to decrypt having just a public-key cert. So I exported public key, removed cert from the store and imported the public key alone. But I can't do my testing that because Windows somehow adds the private key back to the cert. Perhaps, there is some internal cache of private keys or something like that which is activated when CryptoAPI needs the private key. I would like to disable this feature if possible or somehow tell the system that I don't want to use it with my CryptoAPI calls.
The same occurs with Outlook (as it internally uses the same CryptoAPI functions).
I now added the excerpt from sources (cannot create the fully self-contained sample as it turns out to be too complex) but the decryption part should be OK. I double checked that the private key appears in the certificate at the very moment when CryptDecryptMessage is executed, not before or after.

"10626617","Translate PEM to DER on Windows CE 3","I have a RSA public key crypto wrapper which works quite well in desktop Windows and Windows Embedded/POSReady. I need to port this system to both Windows CE 5 and Windows CE 3. In part of this system, I allow developers to import various crypto objects, such as certificates and keys, in several encodings. The most commonly used encoding is Base64 encoded PEM. On most versions of Windows, it is easy to convert encodings to the binary (DER) format that Windows needs for CryptDecodeObjectEx calls:
bool MyClass::externalToBinary( const DATA_BLOB &in, DATA_BLOB &outDER )
{
    DWORD flags;

    // This call determines the format and how much memory is needed in outDER
    if ( ::CryptStringToBinaryA( reinterpret_cast<char *>(in.pbData), in.cbData, CRYPT_STRING_ANY,     NULL, &outDER.cbData, NULL, &flags ) == false &&
         ::CryptStringToBinaryA( reinterpret_cast<char *>(in.pbData), in.cbData, CRYPT_STRING_HEX_ANY, NULL, &outDER.cbData, NULL, &flags ) == false )
    {
        // Log errors here using ::GetLastError();

    }
    return ( ::CryptStringToBinaryA( reinterpret_cast<char *>(in.pbData), in.cbData, flags, outDER.pbData, &outDER.cbData, NULL, NULL ) != FALSE );
} // end externalToBinary

Unfortunately, CryptStringToBinary doesn't exist in Windows CE 3's version of CryptoAPI. While I can do away with support for less popular encodings (such as hex), I really don't want to remove support for PEM encoding in the CE 3 version of the API.
Does anyone have a CryptStringToBinary alternative that would work on Windows CE 3? The developers using this API don't currently have OpenSSL as a dependency, so I would prefer not to add it just for this.
","Well - PEM is simply base64 encoded DER. So if this is the only place you need to convert; I'd just forego the API niceties; strip off any empty line or line starting with a '-'; and base64 decode the anything in between. The result is the DER you're after. WindowsCE3 has a Encode/Decodeter type for Base64; If for some reason you do not/cannot want to use that - How do I base64 encode (decode) in C? or http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/cpp/common/base64.html are fairly trivial 'raw' versions.

"35853008","Save and load Smart Card Certificate","I need help on sending certificate information from one program to another, and logging into Windows with that information through the use of CredMarshalCredential and LogonUser. My program currently passes credentials and logs in successfully with a regular username/password combination. I'm just adding the ability to do it with Smart Card credentials.
I've used this example successfully to login with a Smart Card Certificate.
This works when you run the program as the user, but not when trying to run the program as SYSTEM. This is because SYSTEM cannot access the user's ""MY"" store. I'm trying to work around this, either by passing the cert or the entire cert store to the program running as SYSTEM from an application running as the user.
I've tried numerous approaches to get something that would login successfully after serialization, but haven't gotten anything to successfully work. The approach that seems to work the best has been to call CertSaveStore and Open the BLOB. I've used the last example at the bottom of this Microsoft Example Page. This restores the cert store from the BLOB correctly, finds certs, and even generates a username. But the generated username is different than the original generated username and fails to login with an error of ERROR_LOGON_FAILURE (The user name or password is incorrect).
My current test applications saves the cert and loads it again in the same program. I've taken the SYSTEM aspect out of the equation for now. I'm guessing the restored cert store is missing some information, but I'm not sure what I'm missing. Any insight would be appreciated.
One last note, I originally tried to just pass the generated username and PIN to SYSTEM and have it step down, but it failed with the same ERROR_LOGON_FAILURE error. I'm assuming the username has to be regenerated since being called by a different user/program, but that assumption could be wrong.
","I have gotten my example program working with CertSerializeCertificatesStoreElement and CertAddCertificateContextToStore. I am able to serialize the certificate, and add it to a new store in memory at a later time. I had tried this earlier, but accidentally did not save the size of the serialized item, I just tried to use sizeof() the item which returned an incorrect size.
If anyone is looking to send certificate credentials between programs in the same userspace this approach will work well.
I took this ahead step further and implemented it in my userspace/SYSTEM paradigm. The logic worked correctly, and I was able to generate a username but still failed to LogonUser. After another week or trial and error, I found a solution that works between the userspace and SYSTEM. I ended up having to use LsaLogonUser instead of LogonUser.
If anyone is looking to have a userspace program send credentials to a daemon running in SYSTEM and have that program step down to the user use this example. I initially tried this very similar example, but it continues to fail. In the working example, you do not need to pass in a domain or username, just the PIN. The system will read the Smart Card from the reader and verify with the passed in PIN. This solution will work across computers, ONLY IF the smart card is located at the remote computer. I am looking into a way to accomplish having it work with the smart card in the host computer, but it is outside of this post.
I hope this saves someone the weeks of work I put into getting to this point.

What is it there for?
","It's not undocumented, and it's not a flag. From the page you linked for CryptGenKey (emphasis mine):

Specifies the type of key generated. The sizes of a session key, RSA signature key, and RSA key exchange keys can be set when the key is generated. The key size, representing the length of the key modulus in bits, is set with the upper 16 bits of this parameter. Thus, if a 2,048-bit RSA signature key is to be generated, the value 0x08000000 is combined with any other dwFlags predefined value with a bitwise-OR operation. The upper 16 bits of 0x08000000 is 0x0800, or decimal 2,048. The RSA1024BIT_KEY value can be used to specify a 1024-bit RSA key

The #define provides the key size used to represent the length of the key modulus in bytes in the upper 16 bits, exactly like the above states. The code sample you've included uses 0x00800000 instead, to indicate a 128-bit key.
The quote goes on to explain:
The upper 16 bits of 0x08000000 is 0x0800, or decimal 2,048.
The key size (in the upper 16 bits) is combined with a bitwise OR of one of the predefined flag values.

I suspect that this means that you are performing the base64 encoding line by line. It's much simpler to perform the encoding on the entire file.
For example you might do this as follows:

Load the file into a TStringList.
Extract a single string representing the file using the Text property of the string list.
Base64 encode that string.
Send it over the wire.

"9115974","Passing a structure appears to corrupt data","I have a program that needs to pass data from C++ to C# and back for processing.  In order to do this, I have retrieved a structure, converted it into a byte array and then converted it back on the other end.  However, when converting it back, the data is not correct, even though the memory dump shows that the values in memory for each variable are identical.
Here is the code to retrieve the value:
array<Byte> ^ GetPublicKeyBlob(String ^ ContainerName) {
    const TCHAR * tContainer = context->marshal_as<const TCHAR*>(ContainerName);
    HCRYPTPROV hProv = NULL;
    CryptAcquireContext(&hProv, tContainer, MS_ENHANCED_PROV, PROV_RSA_FULL, CRYPT_MACHINE_KEYSET);
    DWORD dwKeySize = 0;
    CryptExportPublicKeyInfo(hProv, AT_SIGNATURE, X509_ASN_ENCODING, NULL, &dwKeySize);
    PCERT_PUBLIC_KEY_INFO pbKey = (PCERT_PUBLIC_KEY_INFO)calloc(dwKeySize, sizeof(BYTE));
    CryptExportPublicKeyInfo(hProv, AT_SIGNATURE, X509_ASN_ENCODING, (PCERT_PUBLIC_KEY_INFO)pbKey, &dwKeySize);
    array<Byte> ^ retVal = gcnew array<Byte>(dwKeySize);
        for(int i = 0; i < dwKeySize; i++)
            retVal[i] = ((BYTE*)pbKey)[i];

    free(pbKey);
return retVal;
}

Then on the other end, I change it back to a PCERT_PUBLIC_KEY_INFO structure with the following code:
BYTE * cpiBuffer = (BYTE*)calloc(_PublicKey->Length, sizeof(BYTE));
for(int i = 0; i < _PublicKey->Length; i++)
    cpiBuffer[i] = _PublicKey[i];
PCERT_PUBLIC_KEY_INFO cpi = (PCERT_PUBLIC_KEY_INFO)cpiBuffer;

When looking at them in a memory dump, pbKey, retVal, _PublicKey, cpiBuffer and cpi all have the exact same values.  But when looking at cpi as a structure, the Algorithm.pszObjId points to some erroneous memory location and when I try to use it in a function, it fails.  What am I doing wrong here?
","typedef struct _CRYPT_ALGORITHM_IDENTIFIER {
  LPSTR            pszObjId;
  CRYPT_OBJID_BLOB Parameters;
} CRYPT_ALGORITHM_IDENTIFIER, *PCRYPT_ALGORITHM_IDENTIFIER;

As you can see, pszObjId is a pointer, it's contents are somewhere in memory. By casting the PCERT_PUBLIC_KEY_INFO structure to byte array you are only getting the value of the pointer, not what it points to.
On a side note, I'm not sure why are you marshaling as TCHAR*, if you want bytes then you should use char* or unsigned char*. If UNICODE is defined TCHAR will be wchar_t and that might make some difficulties.

"40238501","Windows CryptoAPI symmetric encoding/decoding block that already aligning","I need migrating from OpenSSL to MS CryptoAPI.
When I use OpenSSL, I got N-bytes (already aligned - for example, let say the data length = 32bytes) of data and encode/decode it from one buffer to another. All works fine.
Now I must ""use CryptoAPI!"".
So I write something like:
    // Import AES key
    if(!CryptImportKey(m_hProvider, (CONST BYTE*)&aeskey, structsize, NULL, 0, &m_hAesKey ) ) {
        throw WinAESException(""SetKey: Import key failed"");
    }

    // Set Mode
    DWORD dwMode = CRYPT_MODE_ECB; //I can also use CRYPT_MODE_CBC with set of IV but let simple the code;
    if(!CryptSetKeyParam(m_hAesKey, KP_MODE, (BYTE*)&dwMode, 0)) {
        throw WinAESException(""SetKey: Set ECB mode failed"");
    }

It's works ok,
and now I try to encode the data
    DWORD d = (DWORD)psize;
    result = CryptEncrypt( m_hAesKey, NULL, TRUE, 0, buffer, &d, (DWORD)bsize );

And what I see? The encoded part of data is larger than source.
I understand that the CryptEncrypt function somehow padded already padding data?
Is it possible, anyhow, to get the codded result the same size as it was plain data?
I do not use not-aligned block, I want, when I encrypt 32bytes, to get exactly 32bytes, not 48...
When I test expected size 
    DWORD d = 16;
    result = CryptEncrypt( m_hAesKey, NULL, TRUE, 0, 0, &d, (DWORD)bsize );  //need 32

    d = 32;
    result = CryptEncrypt( m_hAesKey, NULL, TRUE, 0, 0, &d, (DWORD)bsize );  //need 48 

    d = 48;
    result = CryptEncrypt( m_hAesKey, NULL, TRUE, 0, 0, &d, (DWORD)bsize );   //need 64

    d = 64;
    result = CryptEncrypt( m_hAesKey, NULL, TRUE, 0, 0, &d, (DWORD)bsize );  //need 80

WTHF I do wrong? 
P.S. If I truncate the encrypted result to desired size and then try to decrypt it, decryption done with returned expected error code, but the data decrypted correctly.  but this hack is not for me...
","It seems that I find the temporary solution.
When I need to encrypt/decrypt the entire block - all I need is to lie the function - ""it is not the last/the only block"":
So type not:
result = CryptEncrypt( m_hAesKey, NULL, TRUE, 0, buffer, &d, (DWORD)bsize );

but:
result = CryptEncrypt( m_hAesKey, NULL, FALSE, 0, buffer, &d, (DWORD)bsize );

Now it works. And hope they do not change concept of padding data at the end of last piece to start add alignment at the begining of block...

openssl smime -sign -in file.xml -out file.out -passin pass:test -binary -nodetach -inkey certificat.priv.pem -signer certificat.pub.pem

To realize this with C# on a desktop application, I have just used the functions of SignedXML. Unfortunately, these functionalities don’t exist in Compact Framework! So, I try to construct my XML by hand by using CryptoAPI. My code works fine but my XML is different from that obtained by OpenSSL.
Here an abstract of my XML (signed):
UNKNOWN STRING (in base 64, it begins by “MII…”)
<?xml version=""1.0""?>
<test>
    CONTENT OF MY XML
    <signature>…</signature>
</test>
FIRST UNKNOWN string (perhaps the Public Key)
SECOND UNKNOWN string (in this string, there is the current date)

So, with CryptoAPI, I've calculated the digest value and the signature. With XMLDocument functions, I have inserted these informations into my XML. Now, I search to understand the composition of the unknown strings described above.
Can you explain me the content of these unknown strings? I have already done several searches but I’ve not found explanation.
Thank you by advance for your help!

","Microsoft's sample code takes the easy way out; because the same API exported the key, it is already in the right format.
In order to construct a valid key blob yourself, you need to look up the documentation for the BCRYPT_DH_KEY_BLOB structure:

A Diffie-Hellman public key BLOB (BCRYPT_DH_PUBLIC_BLOB) has the following format in contiguous memory. The Modulus, Generator, and Public numbers are in big-endian format.

BCRYPT_DH_KEY_BLOB
Modulus[cbKey] // Big-endian.
Generator[cbKey] // Big-endian.
Public[cbKey] // Big-endian.

Looks like your code was only including one of the three components.

I'm familiar with how to accomplish this on Windows using CertGetCertificateChain, but in my research, I haven't found any API that is quite as simple to use.  Specifically, one that will go on the wire to fetch the signing (CA) certificate(s) using the Authority Information Access (AIA) field in the end-entity certificate.
I found this example for gnuTLS, and I found these similar answers here, and here, but I understand that complexity is the enemy of secure crypto and these seem quite complex by comparison.
Is there an API equivalent to CertGetCertificateChain that's cross-platform, as in POSIX-portable?

1) How such a crash possible? And why it happens?
2) How can I call CryptAcquireContextA to handle such a crash?
My considerations.
1) Some troubles with memory. I was searching for memory leaks, but I didn't find any.
2) I tried to use try-catch, but with no result, CryptAcquireContextA crashes anyway. I would like to use function like ""CryptIsValidProvider"" or ""CryptPingProvider"", but I didn't find it.
","If it works when single-stepping, it's probably a race condition (you're paused in the debugger long enough for some other process or driver to make progress).

The idea is to either write a new csp or write a smart card minidriver to talk to the smart card over the smartphone. To achieve this I implement the communication between CSP or smart card minidriver via a simple TCP network connection or a bluetooth connection. Anyhow, in both cases I would need to CSP to load the driver without the card beeing inserted. Does any one have an idea how this can be acchieved?

","Without being familiar with the crypto library: if you have a upper bound for the the number of concurrent executions of crypto_hmac_sha1, you might use a pool of preallocated hash algorithms structures. Given that scheduling/sleeping does not seem to be allowed, such a bound shouldn't be to hard to find: the number of hardware threads will do it.
Also, CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_SLEEP seems suspicious if no scheduling is allowed.

I'm not sure, that this is correct however, also I'm not sure that CryptoAPI does not expect some different format (for example DER instead of PEM).
And finally the revocation check is not correct. I always get the error that the certificate is revoked no matter whether it is in CRL or not.
Can you give me some guidance here? It is important that intermediate.crl.pem must not be obtained thru the network (it must resist on the filesystem). 
Also, I noticed that Windows CE, supports a certificate store called Disallowed which CryptoAPI's chain engine checks during the validation and returns an error (says that the cert is not valid) if the certificate being validated is in there.  
Does using this store instead CRL is better approach?

","Your requirements are mutually exclusive.  That kind of metadata will leak a huge amount of information about the document content, to the point it can't be called secure.
Furthermore, encrypting individual words is futile.  The difficulty of breaking encryption is usually said to be as difficult as breaking the key, but this assumes the information content in the plaintext is greater than that in the key.  For single words, that certainly isn't true.

","First, I suggest different tags.  It sounds like you're really interested in offloading searching to a server in a cryptographically secure way (such that the server doesn't have access to the plaintext and such that the client need not transfer the entire index).
Issues:

An attacker being able to figure out which words are in the index (and which are not) could be an issue for you.  You should state whether it is as a part of your requirements.
An attacker being able to figure out which items in the index occur more frequently could be an issue for you.  You should state whether it is as a part of your requirements.
An attacker being able to associate words with a document could be an issue for you.  You should state whether it is as a part of your requirements.
An attacker may be able to subvert the server entirely and observe queries / retrievals.  You should state security needs in this circumstance as well.
Probably others I haven't thought of.

I'm assuming that you're designing your own, but there is probably some prior art, research, etc. that would be smarter than I am below:
For the first, I suggest that you should hash the words, combining the plaintext with a secret (not shared with the index server) before hashing, and truncating the hash to the point where it is likely to be non-unique in the index.  This costs you hash efficiency, but helps prevent an attacker from using the hash as a plaintext equivalent or experimentally determining the secret
For the second and third, you should encrypt any indexed data (such as counts or document+position) and decrypt it on the client.  This may cost you latency.
For the fourth, you'd want to consider concealing real requests inside groups of unrelated requests, things like that, but you'd want a lot of math to make sure you weren't still vulnerable to statistical analysis.
For the fifth, do some web research.  I'm confident there will be stuff out there, and this is a pretty specific (and less common) need, so you'll want someone who put more thought into it than I just have.

I want to export the secret key of one party using the public key of the second party, and then import that secret key as the second party's secret key (this sets up a shared secret key for communication). Here is my code:
if(!CryptExportKey(encryptT->hSymKey, decryptT->hPubKey, SIMPLEBLOB, 0, keyExBuf, &bufLen)) {

Any idea what could be causing the error?
Thanks,
","Never mind, I figured it out. Basically, you can't just use another public key directly even if it's initialized the same way -- I needed to first export that public key, and then import it using the handle to the cryptographic provider of the other party.

"48673289","How to calculate Subject Key Identifier in CNG?","My goal is to populate the Subject Key Identifier Extension (2.5.29.14) for a certificate using Microsoft CNG. I did it previously with Microsoft CAPI but the function I used:
CryptHashPublicKeyInfo
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380204(v=vs.85).aspx
Is now depreciated. CNG has no such method. However, the descripion for CryptHashPublicKeyInfo in the link above says that they do a SHA1 hash of the public key information. So I did a SHA1 hash of the public key bytes in CNG on the same data in CryptHashPublicKeyInfo (CAPI) and the two hashes are different. I need to resolve this difference. To be clear, my logic is running on the same public key from the same CSR.
Details in RFC 5280 seem to confirm what Microsoft says:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.2

(1) The keyIdentifier is composed of the 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the
             value of the BIT STRING subjectPublicKey (excluding the tag,
             length, and number of unused bits).

  28]   RFC 5280            PKIX Certificate and CRL Profile
  May 2008
  (2) The keyIdentifier is composed of a four-bit type field with
       the value 0100 followed by the least significant 60 bits of
       the SHA-1 hash of the value of the BIT STRING
       subjectPublicKey (excluding the tag, length, and number of
       unused bits).


^I'm guessing Microsoft is doing case #1.
Here is my CAPI code:

    NULL,

}

//alocate data buffer
pbSubjectKeyIdentifier = (LPBYTE)LocalAlloc(0, dwSubjectKeyIdentifier);
//fill data buffer with subject key identifier
if (!CryptHashPublicKeyInfo(
    hHashProv,
    CALG_SHA1, //sha1
    0,
    X509_ASN_ENCODING | PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING,
    &serverCertInfo.SubjectPublicKeyInfo,
    pbSubjectKeyIdentifier,
    &dwSubjectKeyIdentifier
))
{
    throw std::runtime_error(""Unable to fill public key info hash"");
}

CRYPT_DATA_BLOB skiBlob;
skiBlob.cbData = dwSubjectKeyIdentifier;
skiBlob.pbData = pbSubjectKeyIdentifier;

//encode subject key identifier extension
LPBYTE pbEncodeSKI = NULL;
DWORD dwEncodedSKI;
if (!CryptEncodeObject(

I sorted the list by the last three characters, so that it's easy to see in a glance that there are 4 distinct GUID suffixes to the key container files. Now let's enumerate the key reported by all installed CSPs. I'll get the list of providers, and later the list of each provider's keys using the certutil tool that comes with Windows. Its output requires some regex magic for parsing, which is not essential, just convenient:
> certutil -csplist | sls  '^Provider Name: (.*)' | %{ $_.Matches[0].Groups[1].Value }
Microsoft Base Cryptographic Provider v1.0
Microsoft Base DSS and Diffie-Hellman Cryptographic Provider
Microsoft Base DSS Cryptographic Provider
[...snip...]

The output for a single key lists the name, flags and the key container ID, the latter matching respective file name in the above directory (of course, we can see more keys from additional KSPs, smart cards, TPM etc.). Example for one provider (the -q makes some providers fail silently instead of asking for user's action, such as inserting a SmartCard):
> certutil -key -q

  [...snip...]

Some key names are just GUIDs too, but if we grep out only the lines that start with at the least 20 hex digits, there will be only the IDs listed. So all key IDs from all providers can be concisely shown with:
> certutil -csplist | sls '^Provider Name: (.*)' | %{ $_.Matches[0].Groups[1].Value } |
%{ certutil -key -q -csp ""$_"" } | sls '^\s+[0-9a-f]{20}.+' | sort -u

Here are actually 2 more keys than there are in the MachineKeys directory (they come from the KSP, in fact, certutil -key -csp KSP shows them, if you are wondering). But the fact is they all have the same GUID suffix _f7fe3b04-ef9b-4b27-827f-953c5743e2ec.
The machine was installed by the vendor (an HP notebook, to be exact). This is unlike other machines, that we assemble or buy barebone and install and configure by ourselves. And I am working with some sensitive data sometimes, so I am indeed paranoid vetting the software thoroughly before allowing machines to access sensitive data.
The OS is Windows 10, if that matters, but the same type of storage has not changed from Windows 7, AFAIK, even with the introduction of the new CNG API in 8.0 (or 8.1?).

Just in case anyone would find useful a PowerShell snippet to readably list keys by provider, I used this command:
> certutil -csplist | sls  '^Provider Name: (.*)' | %{ $_.Matches[0].Groups[1].Value } |
%{ Write-Host -for Yellow ""`n$_""; certutil -key -q -csp ""$_"" }

"35057272","How to get next certificate in chain","I want to get parent certificate (or all certificates in chain for that matter) from Windows Certificate Store (assuming I know the location of the end certificate). I need to get each one in order to build my own custom X509_STORE (using OpenSSL). 
I think the proper course of action would be:

obtain first certificate using CertFindCertificateInStore (done)
get the certificate chain using CertGetCertificateChain (done)
extract the certificates from chain (?)
for each certificate in chain, convert it using d2i_X509 (done)

or

obtain first certificate using CertFindCertificateInStore (done)
get the parent certificate (if exists) (?)
convert it using d2i_X509, go to 2. (done)

Then create the store.
The question to answer is then - how to get the parent certificate or all certificates in chain using Windows Certificate Store? I'm probably missing some more or less occult function here.
","as the CertFindCertificateInStore outputs a chain context, one can access it's members using the beautiful construction:
chainContext->rgpChain[0]->rgpElement[iCertIndex]->pCertContext->pbCertEncoded
where iCertIndex is between 0 (end-certificate) and chainSize -1 (self-signed root certificate).

"37340414","How to encrypt a file using Crypto API with multiple threads?","I am trying to encrypt a file using multiple threads and Crypto API / AES256 / CBC mode / NO IV (initialization vector) is used.
I am dividing the file into as many number of threads. The thread which gets the last block of the file, does a CryptEncrypt passing Final as true.
Following the approach suggested here: Each thread uses a duplicated key.
Additionally, each thread opens the source file in shared read mode and starts reading from the offset allotted, keeping encrypting and writing to the destination file (again opened in shared write mode) as appropriate offsets.
The output file which i get in case of single and multi threaded is not the same and hash mismatches. What is that i am doing wrong?
","You cannot do that. IV or chaining mode is irrelevant here (though some chaining mode allows parallelism - but is would be its implementation). Consider performing encryption of following text:
""Block cipher mode of operation""

Somehow you divide it this way (2 threads):

""Block cipher mo""
"" de of operation""

How can you be sure that it gets executed (by OS scheduler) in the same sequence? If you divide it into 3 threads, it may be:

""Block ciphe""
""r mode o""
""f operation""

but it may get executed as:

""r mode o""
""f operation""
""Block ciphe""

The end result, as you can guess, would be different!
Also, with CBC mode, the result depends on previous outcome, a mentioned here. See, on the right side, CBC is not parallelizable.

","If you want to obtain different cypertext when encrypting the same plaintext with the same key, you have to use the CBC mode of operation:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation
In order to correctly encrypt with CBC, you need to generate a different random Initialization Vector (IV) every time.
In order to decrypt, you need to know the IV used during encryption.
So, the IV must be associated (in clear) to the cyphertext.
In reference to your example, when calling the CryptDeriveKey function, the CBC is the default mode but it uses an IV set to zero and this invalidates the utility of the CBC operating mode:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa379916(v=vs.85).aspx
In order to set the random IV you need to call the CryptSetKeyParam function, which accept the KP_IV param:

I am not certain just what methods of the CryptoAPI the .NET functions use to encrypt the data.  What options are used, and what method of generating the key is used?
Before someone suggests that I just write it in C# anyway, or create some common library bridge for them, those options are unfortunately off the table.  It really has to work in Win32 with .NET and without using a DLL.  I have some leeway in changing the C# code.

Anyone is familiar with a hack that can save these calls, or it is really impossible?
","I imagine the HCRYPTHASH data structure is more flexible than just being used to call with CryptVerifySignature().  It's designed to operate on a (possibly discontinuous) stream of data (via CryptHashData()), which means it stores some state within it on the hash's current values.  Therefore, once you've used it on a stream (even partial) the state is irrevocably altered, so you can't use it on another stream.
I guess they could've provided a reset function for the HCRYPTHASH structure... but they didn't!

","Those, seemingly random, requests are OSCP lookups (RFC 2560: Online Certificate Status Protocol) to ensure SSL certificates are still valid and have not been revoked.
OSCP lookups by the client are only necessary unless the server does OSCP Stapling (RFC 6961: Multiple Certificate Status Request Extension), which means it provides a signed authoritative OSCP response alongside the SSL certificate chain.
So, as Patrick Meenan pointed out, ""the performance fix to make them not happen is to enable OCSP Stapling on the web server.""
If the server does not staple the OSCP data, the client should make an OSCP request, unless it already has a valid cached response from a recent OSCP request. On a Windows client, the OSCP request will submitted via the operating system's CryptoAPI unless there is already a valid cached response.
To ensure repeatable web page test results, tests should require the certificate cache to be empty at the start of a test, which on webpagetest.org is configured in Advanced Settings -> Advanced -> ""Clear SSL Certificate Caches"".

Any thoughts on why the presence of the kernel debugger is not preventing the signature check on the test CSP?  Does that setup only work in a remote-debug environment?
","You'll need a remote debugger to disable the signature check.
There are various mechanisms such as 1394 (FireWire) or Serial Cable by which you can can connect the second computer for remote debugging.
If your CSP can run in a VM, then that would be an option too if you just have the one machine.

"53953631","Translate Windows RC4 CryptDeriveKey to PHP for openssl","This is the second component of the legacy system translation we’ve been trying to do.  We have managed to match exactly the initial binary password/key that Windows ::CryptHashData generates.
That password/key is passed to ::CryptDeriveKey where it performs a number of steps to create the final key to be used by ::CryptEncrypt.  My research has led me to the CryptDeriveKey documentation where it clearly describes the steps required to derive the key for ::CryptEncrypt but so far I haven’t been able to get it to decrypt the file on the PHP side. 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptderivekey
Based on the ::CryptDeriveKey documentation there may be some additional undocumented steps for our specific legacy key size that may not be well understood.  The current Windows ::CryptDeriveKey is set for ZERO SALT by default which is apparently different from NO_SALT somehow.  See salt value functionality here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/salt-value-functionality
The parameters on the CryptAPI for our legacy system are as follows:
Provider type:      PROV_RSA_FULL
Provider name:  MS_DEF_PROV
Algo ID     CALG_RC4        
Description     RC4 stream encryption algorithm
Key length:         40 bits.
Salt length:        88 bits.   ZERO_SALT
Special Note:       A 40-bit symmetric key with zero-value salt, however, is not equivalent to a 40-bit symmetric key without salt. For interoperability, keys must be created without salt. This problem results from a default condition that occurs only with keys of exactly 40 bits.
I’m not looking to export the key, but reproduce the process that creates the final encryption key that is passed to ::CryptEncrypt for the RC4 encryption algorithm and have it work with openssl_decrypt.
Here is the current windows code that’s working fine for encrypt.

}

Here is the PHP code that tries to replicate the ::CryptDeriveKey function as described in the documentation.
Let n be the required derived key length, in bytes. The derived key is the first n bytes of the hash value after the hash computation has been completed by CryptDeriveKey. If the hash is not a member of the SHA-2 family and the required key is for either 3DES or AES, the key is derived as follows:

Form a 64-byte buffer by repeating the constant 0x36 64 times. Let k be the length of the hash value that is represented by the input parameter hBaseData. Set the first k bytes of the buffer to the result of an XOR operation of the first k bytes of the buffer with the hash value that is represented by the input parameter hBaseData.
Form a 64-byte buffer by repeating the constant 0x5C 64 times. Set the first k bytes of the buffer to the result of an XORoperation of the first k bytes of the buffer with the hash value that is represented by the input parameter hBaseData.
Hash the result of step 1 by using the same hash algorithm as that used to compute the hash value that is represented by the hBaseData parameter.
Hash the result of step 2 by using the same hash algorithm as that used to compute the hash value that is represented by the hBaseData parameter.
Concatenate the result of step 3 with the result of step 4.
Use the first n bytes of the result of step 5 as the derived key.

PHP Decrypt Function
function decryptRC4($encrypted, $key){

    $cypher = ‘rc4-40’;
    $decrypted = openssl_decrypt($encrypted, $cypher, $key, $opts);
    return $decrypted; 
}

So here are the big questions:
Has anyone been able to successfully replicate ::CryptDeriveKey with RC4 on another system?  
Does anyone know what is missing from the PHP script we created that prevents it from creating the same key and decrypt the Windows CryptoAPI encrypted file with openssl_decrypt?  
Where and how do we create the 88 bit zero-salt that is required for the 40bit key?
What are the correct openssl_decrypt parameters that would accept this key and decrypt what was generated by ::CryptDeriveKey? 
Yes, we know this isn’t secure and its not being used for passwords or PII.   We would like to move away from this old and insecure method, but we need take this interim step of translating the original encryption to PHP first for interoperability with the existing deployed systems.  Any help or guidance would be appreciated.
","Just in case anyone else wanders down this path here are the answers to all the questions above.
You can replicate ::CryptDeriveKey on PHP using openssl but there are some prerequisites that have to be met on the windows side first.  
CryptDeriveKey MUST be set to CRYPT_NO_SALT as follows:
::CrypeDeriveKey(hCryptProv, CALG_RC4, hSaveHash, CRYPT_NO_SALT, &hCryptKey)

This will allow you to create a key from your hash and generate a matching key in PHP that will work on openssl.  If you don't set any salt parameters you will get a key that is created with an unknown proprietary salt algorithm that cant be matched on another system. 
The reason that you have to set CRYPT_NO_SALT is because both the CryptAPI and openssl have proprietary salt algorithms and there is no way to get them to match.  So you should do your salting separately.  There are more details about this salt value functionality here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/salt-value-functionality
Here is what the PHP script needs to look like to create an equivalent passkey for for openssl to use.
<?php
$random = pack('c*', 87,194,...........);
$origSecret = 'ASCII STRING OF CHARACTERS AS PASSWORD'; 

//Need conversion to match format of Windows CString or wchar_t*
//Windows will probably be UTF-16LE and LAMP will be UTF-8
$secret = iconv('UTF-8','UTF-16LE', $origSecret);

//Create hash key from Random and Secret
//This is basically a hash and salt process.
$hash = hash_init(""md5"");
hash_update($hash, $random);
hash_update($hash, $secret);
$key = hash_final($hash);

$key = cryptoDeriveKey($key);
//Convert the key hex array to a hex string for openssl_decrypt
$count = count($key);
$maxchars = 2;
for ($i=0; $i<$count; $i++){
    $key .= str_pad(dechex($key[$i]), $maxchars, ""0"", STR_PAD_LEFT);
}

IMPORTANT:  OpenSSL expects the key to be the raw hex values that are derived from the hash, unfortunately openssl_decrypt() wants the same value as a string or password.  Therefor you have to do a hex to string conversion at this point.  There is a great write up here on why you have to do this.
http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-encrypt.php
$opts = OPENSSL_RAW_DATA | OPENSSL_ZERO_PADDING;
//Convert key hex string to a string for openssl_decrypt
//Leave it as it is for openssl command line.
$key = hexToStr($key);
$cipher = 'rc4-40';
$encrypted = “the data you want to encrypt or decrypt”;
$decrypted = openssl_decrypt($encrypted, $cipher, $key, $opts);  

echo $decrypted;  //This is the final information you’re looking for


function cryptoDeriveKey($key){
//convert the key into hex byte array as int
    $hashKey1 = str_split($key,2);
    $count = count($hashKey1);
    $hashKeyInt = array();
    for ($i=0; $i<$count; $i++){
        $hashKeyInt[$i] = hexdec($hashKey1[$i]);
    }
    $hashKey = $hashKeyInt;
    //Let n be the required derived key length, in bytes.  CALG_RC4 = 40 bits key with 88 salt bits
    $n = 40/8;
    //Chop the key down to the first 40 bits or 5 bytes.
    $finalKey = array();
    for ($i=0; $i <$n; $i++){
        $finalKey[$i] =  $hashKey[$i];
    }
    return $finalKey;
}


function hexToStr($hex){
    $string='';
    for ($i=0; $i < strlen($hex)-1; $i+=2){
        $string .= chr(hexdec($hex[$i].$hex[$i+1]));
    }
return $string;
}
?>

If you’re having trouble getting the correct values after using the code above you can try exporting your key value from CryptoAPI and testing it with openssl command line.
First you have to set CryptDeriveKey to allow the key to be exported with CRYPT_EXPORTABLE and CRYPT_NO_SALT
::CrypeDeriveKey(hCryptProv, CALG_RC4, hSaveHash, CRYPT_EXPORTABLE | CRYPT_NO_SALT, &hCryptKey)

If you want to know how to display a PLAINTEXTKEYBLOB from the exported key follow this link.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/seccrypto/example-c-program--importing-a-plaintext-key
Here is an example exported key blob
0x08 0x02 0x00 0x00 0x01 0x68 0x00 0x00 0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xAA 0xBB 0xCC 0xDD 0xEE   
0x08 0x02 0x00 0x00 0x01 0x68 0x00 0x00  //BLOB header matches almost exactly
0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00                      //Key length in bytes is correct 5 bytes
0xAA 0xBB 0xCC 0xDD 0xEE                 //First 5 bytes of our created hash key!!
Use your exported key value from the BLOB as the Hex Key Value in the openssl enc command below.
openssl enc -d -rc4-40 -in testFile-NO_SALT-enc.txt -out testFile-NO_SALT-dec.txt -K ""Hex Key Value"" -nosalt -nopad

This will decrypt the file that was encrypted on the Windows machine using CryptEncrypt.
As you can see, when you set the CryptDeriveKey to CRYPT_NO_SALT all you need for the openssl password or key is the first “keylength” bits of your CryptHashData password.  Simple enough to say but a real pain to get to.  Good luck and hope this helps someone else with legacy Windows translation issues.

I decide to use AES 256bit cypher in CBC for packets encryption and RSA 2048bit for sending / receiving the AES symmetric key.
I have read many examples, even succeed writing few snippets using this lib such as:

Encrypting / Decrypting Unicode String using AES
Encrypting / Decrypting Streams using AES

those two snippets works fine and are quite easy to write.
Now I want to Encrypt / Decrypt on the fly any static bytes array (which comes from my server or client) but I can't get it work for some reason which are probably really stupid.
I'm not even sure if using CryptoAPI is the way to go for such needs.
This is my attempt which fails with the error : 234 (ERROR_MORE_DATA)

I'm sure I'm doing something wrong somewhere, but I don't understand why.
When I change the Final to false the error doesn't came up but I don't know why I would need to use this flag (else than true) since I just want to encrypt packets by packets. 
Notice:
The data parameter could contain static byte array (Network arrival / sent buffers)
Generally : buffer : array[0..1023] of byte 
I copy this static bytes array to a dynamic one which is the destination one to be encrypted / decrypted.
So the exact question is:
How could I encrypt / decrypt on the fly data for Winsock communication without using third part components / packages just the CryptoAPI?

"15818420","Getting same ciphertext every time from the same plaintext","I am using Microsoft CryptoAPI to encrypt the password. Using 3DES from Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider. What I noticed is that I seem to be getting exactly the same ciphertext from the same plaintext every time. As far as I know this should not be happening in CBC mode, which CALG_3DES is operating in according to MSDN. I know 3DES is old and I should be using AES instead but this is a legacy code and I would like to avoid changing the algorithm. Am I doing something wrong? I think I might need to provide IV but I do not see how it can be done for 3DES using CryptoAPI. None of MSDN samples show it. Below is the redacted code snippet that shows the sequence of CryptoAPI calls.
Here is my code so far:
CryptAcquireContext(&hProvider, NULL,  MS_ENH_RSA_AES_PROV, PROV_RSA_AES, CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT);

/// key acquired by some means and stored in pszTempData

CryptCreateHash( hProvider, CALG_SHA_256, 0, 0, &hHash );

CryptHashData( hHash, (BYTE *)pszTempData, wcslen(pszTempData), 0 );

CryptDeriveKey( hProvider, CALG_3DES, hHash,  CRYPT_EXPORTABLE, &hDecEncKey );


// some buffer manipulation to ensure buffer size is of correct size

CryptEncrypt( hDecEncKey, 0, TRUE, 0, pbBuffer, &dwCount, dwBufferLen );

CryptBinaryToString(pbBuffer, dwCount, CRYPT_STRING_BINARY, wsTempOut, &dwStrLen);

","This question was never answered adequately. You can set the IV the same way for any cryptographic algorithm that supports IVs. The Microsoft CryptoAPI deals with variables called HCRYPTKEY for interacting with keys. HCRYPTKEY is nothing special, just a variable that contains a numeric value that is a handle to a key. The Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP) can look up and interact with keys when you use this HCRYPTKEY handle. In your case, call CryptSetKeyParam(hDecEncKey, KP_IV, the_IV_Bytes, 0);.

"28859065","Check pointer handle is valid","I want to implement a Microsoft CryptographicServiceProvider library and currently I thinking about the best way how to deal with context handle which I create. 
My question is specific to this case but the design approach can be used in other situations.
I come from a managed code background and I am not 100% shure about multithread pointer handling in C/C++.
In general there are two functions which are responsible for handle creation and destruction (CryptAcquireContext, CryptReleaseContext), and all subsequent CSP functions uses the handle which is return by the creator function.
I didn't found any concrete information or specification from Microsoft which gives a design approach or rules how to do it. But I did research with other CSP providers created by Microsoft to find out the design rules, which are:

The functions must be thread safe
The context handle will not be shared between threads
If a context handle is not valid return with an error

Other MS CSP Provider will return a valid pointer as handle, or NULL if not.
I don't think that the calling application will pass complete garbage but it could happen that it passes a handle which has been already released and my library should return with an error.
This brought me to three ideas how to implement that:

Just allocate memory of my context struct with malloc or new and return the raw pointer as handle. 
I can expect that the applications which call my library will pass a valid handle. But if not my library will run into an undefined behaviour.    So I need a better solution.
Add the pointer which I create to a list (std::list, std::map). So I can iterate the list to check if the pointer exists. The access to the list is guarded with a mutex.
This should be safe and a regular API usage shouldn't be a performance issue. But in a Terminal Server scenario it could be. In this case the Windows process lsass.exe creates for every user who wants to login a CSP context in a separate thread and makes around 10 API calls per context.
The design goal is that my library should be able to handle 300 clients parallel. I don't know how many threads a created by Windows in this case.
So if possible I would prefer a lockless implementation.
I allocate a basic struct which holds a check value and the pointer of the actual data. Use the pointer of this struct as context handle.
typedef struct CSPHandle  
{  
    int Type; // (eg. magic number CSPContext=0xA1B2C3D4)  
    CSPContextPtr pCSPContext;  
};

So I could read the first byte of the passed pointer and check if the data equals my defined type. And I have the full control about actual data pointer, which is set to NULL if the context is released. Is this a good or bad idea?

What are your thoughts about this case? Should I go with one of these approaches or is there a other solution? 
Thanks
","I found a solution and will answer my question.
I overlooked a little but important detail
In CSP there are not direct API calls to the dll (load library, get function pointer, call function) because the function calls are forwarded by the Microsoft CSP which loads the CSP library by name. 
So the Microsoft CSP needs to know and to check the passed context to get a correct mapping to the specific library.
Example:
1. client->cryptacquirecontext(in cspname, out ctx)
2. MS CSP->loads libray from the cspname
3. MS CSP->calls the function pointer of the loaded library
4. CSP LIB->cryptacquirecontext creates new context
5. MS CSP->receives the returned csp handle and saves it to the dll mapping
6. MS CSP->returns the result to the calling application
7. client->cryptsetprovparam(ctx) // which was created before
8. MS CSP->checks if the context exists and which library is responsible
9. MS CSP->if the given context can not be mapped to a csp dll an error will be   returned, because the MS CSP doesn’t know which function pointer should be called.
So in this case it should be sufficient just to allocate memory. If the client application passes invalid context handle it will never hit the csp library.
I think that the MS CSP uses a list with mutex guard to store the context mappings. Because the context can be anything from a random number to a valid pointer.

","It sounds like the problem you are describing is not really about reading the certificates, but simply knowing where they live. 
Trying to build something that can automatically discover where trusted certificates live on any running machine is almost certainly impossible, and probably not a good idea anyway.
Instead, this sounds like it should be solved with a simple environment variable (the problem after all is about variability of certificate paths on different environments). 
You might set 3 environment variable, let's call them CERT_PATH, KEY_PATH and CA_PATH. You can configure these on any OS to point to the correct location. You can then reference them in your application:
var fs = require('fs');  
var https = require('https');

var options = {  
    key: fs.readFileSync(process.env.KEY_PATH),
    cert: fs.readFileSync(process.env.CERT_PATH),

The CP functions are the underlying implementations of the CryptoAPI within a particular CSP.

If I use CPEncrypt then I call CSP functions directly, without

Do not call them directly; abusing the intended use pattern of a security API is a very bad idea and in the case of the CryptoAPI the intended pattern is to go via the API's CryptXXX functions.

And if I use CryptEcrypt, it calls CriptoAPI, and CriptoAPI calls CSP functions?

CryptEncrypt is part of the CryptoAPI, calling it will eventually invoke CPEncrypt in whatever CSP you are using.

Win32 has CryptGenRandom and even RtlGenRandom. Windows Store 10 and Universal Windows has BCryptGenRandom. However, there's a hole for Windows Phone 8 and Windows Store 8 because CryptoAPI is not available, and CNG is only available on Windows 10 and Universal Windows. The MSDN docs say BCryptGenRandom is available for ""Windows Store"", but they don't say its Windows Store 10 and UWP (thanks CW).
The libraries are unmanaged C/C++. They are written in standard/portable C and C++. On occasion, they have to use a OS specific API like those for gathering random number. They don't compile against managed APIs, and they don't link to managed libraries.
What do we use for random numbers for Windows Phone 8 and Windows Store 8?

"48348550","CertGetCertificateChain - Invalid memory access","Cross-posting for visibility: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jna-users/qfkoxPwA-r8
I am working on creating a wrapper for the CertGetCertificateChain method in the Crypt32 lib and I would like to get help in resolving an 'Invalid Memory Access' issue that results in a crash.
The signature for the wrapper is:
boolean CertGetCertificateChain(Pointer hChainEngine, PCERT_CONTEXT pCertContext, Pointer pTime,
            Pointer hAdditionalStore, CERT_CHAIN_PARA.ByReference pChainPara, int dwFlags, Pointer pvReserved,
            PointerByReference ppChainContext);

The structures i am using are:
public static class CERT_CHAIN_PARA extends Structure {
    public int cbSize;
    public CERT_USAGE_MATCH RequestedUsage;

    @Override
    protected List<String> getFieldOrder() {
        return Arrays.asList(""cbSize"", ""RequestedUsage"");
    }


    public static class ByReference extends CERT_CHAIN_PARA implements Structure.ByReference {}
}


public static class CERT_USAGE_MATCH extends Structure {
    public int dwType;
    public CERT_ENHKEY_USAGE Usage;


    @Override
    protected List<String> getFieldOrder() {
        return Arrays.asList(""dwType"", ""Usage"");
    }


    public static class ByReference extends CERT_USAGE_MATCH implements Structure.ByReference {}
}


public static class CERT_ENHKEY_USAGE extends Structure {
    public int cUsageIdentifier;
    public LPSTR.ByReference rgpszUsageIdentifier;


    @Override
    protected List<String> getFieldOrder() {
        return Arrays.asList(""cUsageIdentifier"", ""rgpszUsageIdentifier"");
    }


    public static class ByReference extends CERT_ENHKEY_USAGE implements Structure.ByReference {}
}

There are copies of the ones in the Wincrypt.h header. CERT_CHAIN_PARA has additional members that become active only when a flag is enabled and I have not enabled it in the native code. So, i avoided adding them here.
The calling code is:
CERT_CHAIN_PARA.ByReference pChainPara = new CERT_CHAIN_PARA.ByReference();
PointerByReference p = new PointerByReference();


pChainPara.cbSize = pChainPara.size();
pChainPara.RequestedUsage.dwType = WinCrypt.USAGE_MATCH_TYPE_AND;
pChainPara.RequestedUsage.Usage.cUsageIdentifier = 0;
pChainPara.RequestedUsage.Usage.rgpszUsageIdentifier = null;


CertGetCertificateChain(null, pCertContext, null, null, pChainPara, 0, null, p);

The crash happens on the call to CertGetCertificateChain. One thing i've noticed it that setting pChainPara to null stops it from throwing the memory access exception and crashing. But i am not sure if this is because the pChainPara structure is corrupt or if setting null forces it to fail early and masks an issue somewhere else. I've checked the sizes of the structure passed in and they match with the sizes in the native code.
Please let me know if i need to provide more information. Once implemented and tested, i'll clean this up and contribute the certificate workflow's wrappers and structures to JNA.
Edit:
I tried adding the additional members in CERT_CHAIN_PARA as given below:

","It's quite possible that you need to define the remainder of the CERT_CHAIN_PARA structure, since its expected size depends on a compile-time variable (independent of what you might supply in cbSize).

Note  This member can be used only if CERT_CHAIN_PARA_HAS_EXTRA_FIELDS
  is defined by using the #define directive before including Wincrypt.h.
  If this value is defined, the application must zero all unused fields.

UPDATE
PCERT_CONTEXT is a typedef to CERT_CONTEXT *. Your Java definition will in effect make it CERT_CONTEXT **, at least w/r/t passing it as a parameter. If you need native CERT_CONTEXT *, use Java CERT_CONTEXT as the parameter type.  Embedding a pointer field within a struct effectively gives the callee the address of the value you wish to pass, rather than the pointer value you really want to pass.
In general you should omit the <Structure>.ByReference notation unless you are defining a structure field that needs to be of type struct *.

"32208100","Do Windows crypto APIs run slower on purpose with debugger attached to the process?","In my Windows application I needed to implement the PBKDF2 encryption for passwords. For that I needed to calculate HMAC using SHA-256 many times over. So for a single round of that I was calling the following sequence of APIs:
//For simplicity I'm not posting the full code
//One can look up implementation of HMAC/SHA-256 in C
CryptAcquireContext(, NULL, MS_ENHANCED_PROV, PROV_RSA_FULL, CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT | CRYPT_NEWKEYSET);
CryptImportKey(, , 0, CRYPT_IPSEC_HMAC_KEY, );
CryptCreateHash(, CALG_HMAC, , 0, );
CryptSetHashParam(, HP_HMAC_INFO, , 0);
CryptHashData(, , , 0);
CryptGetHashParam(, HP_HASHVAL, NULL, , 0);
CryptGetHashParam(, HP_HASHVAL, , , 0);

This sequence may be called on the order of 10,000+ times in a sort of a loop according to PBKDF2 specifications.
I started noticing though, that if I run this sequence via Ctrl+F5 (in Visual Studio), or without a debugger, it executes in about less than 1 sec on my laptop. But if I attach a debugger to the process, it runs painfully slow -- sometimes close to 10+ seconds or so. (The timing in this case is also inconsistent.)
So I thought that this happens because of a debugger build. So I tried building a release build and then attached a debugger. To my amazement it was also running slow.
So I'm curious, is there something in those crypto APIs that make them run slower with the debugger attached?
","
I just tried it and if I attach Visual Studio debugger to my running process, it doesn't seem to happen.

Then it depends from the Windows debug heap (not to be confused with the CRT debug heap, which is completely unrelated and is activated building in debug mode):

Instead of using the standard heap API, processes that the debugger creates use a special debug heap. You can force a spawned process to use the standard heap instead of the debug heap by using the _NO_DEBUG_HEAP environment variable or the -hd command-line option.

The call works now without an exception - but it's still very slow. During investigation using Fiddler I recognized that there where four additional HTTP requests which all times out. The last call is the call from my request which works.
So I know the reason for the delay.
Fiddler shows ""CryptoAPI"" as the user agent for the additional calls. I know that CryptoAPI tries to resolve the certificate chain by downloading the missing certificates - but the host isn't available.
I know, I can manually install all needed certificates to the certificate store. Then it works and the additional requests are gone.
But I wonder if is it also possible to disable the certificate chain check via CryptoAPI? It's an intranet service and therefore the check isn't really important.

To benchmark the enumeration, I am leaving context acquisition and release out of the loop, and clocking only the enumeration, and repeat the enumeration 100 times. What I am noticing is that the enumeration is significantly slower for a normal user than an administrator. When I run the test as myself (member of Administrators with UAC enabled), I am getting 
--- User key store access performance test...  3.317211 ms per pass
--- Machine key store access performance test...  78.051593 ms per pass

However, when I run the same test from an elevated prompt, the result is dramatically different:
--- User key store access performance test...  3.279580 ms per pass
--- Machine key store access performance test...  1.499939 ms per pass

Under the hood, more keys are reported to an admin than to non-admin user, but that's expected and normal. What I do not understand is why the enumeration is ~40 times slower for a non-admin user. Any pointers?
I am putting the full source of my test into a Gist. The test is run on a pretty generic Windows 7 machine without any crypto hardware.
Added: on a Server 2012 virtual machine on a Server 2012 HyperV host, the slowdown factor was even greater, over 130: 440 vs 3.3 ms. 440ms is a performance issue for me, indeed.
","Could it be related to this issue from Microsoft:
You experience poor performance when you call the CryptAcquireContext function in Windows Server 2008 R2 or in Windows 7
From the issue:
""This issue occurs because of a change in the CryptAcquireContext function in Windows Server 2008 R2 and in Windows 7.
This change checks whether the function runs in a domain environment. However, the process is time-consuming and causes the increased running time of the CryptAcquireContext function.""

How can i implement this thing in my code. (I am using VB 6)
Re-phrasing my question: How is password converted into 2 elements HMAC_key and encryption_key?

Let's see if I can explain further..
Encryption software used is CryptoSys while decryptionis done by CodeIgnitor..which is not working
So the difference I can see between the two is that codeignitor is expecting an HMAC authmessage when decrypting while the encryption does not prepend it the final message. So how can i do that? I am using VB6 for encryption.

So far I have come to the conclusion that there could be 2 key-derivation function a pb-kdf or a h-kdf.
The h-kdf authentication in particular works as follows:

A password is enterd by user
Based on this password and a random IV, an HMAC key is generated using HKDF and SHA-512 digest algo.
This HMAC key is saved and also expanded and then using IV/salt encrypts the plaintext message.
The IV is pre-pended to the plain-text message and base64 encoded.
The HMAC key is then pre-pended to the final message gereated in step 4.

So basically hkdf does not convert a key into 2 elements but only uses the basic key generated to generate other keys (and HMAC key is the original key used to generate other keys) now my question becomes...
Is there any vb6 library that uses hkdf and sha-512? As far as i have researched, Chilkat and CryptoSys APIs are only pbkdf based..Am I correct?

","The SChannel provider doesn't support AT_SIGNATURE RSA keys, only AT_EXCHANGE.  It's mainly a holdover from early TLS (back when it was still SSL) when keys were exchanged using RSA encryption instead of agreed upon using Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement signed with RSA signature... and then, presumably ""well, everybody knows how the SChannel provider behaves, why change it?"".  (The closest I see to that being written down is https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa387690(v=vs.85).aspx, which shows CALG_RSA_KEYX and doesn't talk about CALG_RSA_SIGN.)
In CAPI an AT_EXCHANGE key can do both encryption and signing, and an AT_SIGNATURE key can only do signing.
In general the Windows Cryptography team discourages new code written with CAPI (I don't have written evidence othen than what I just wrote; mainly this has come from being in meetings with them).  CNG has a much more developer-friendly API, and is more powerful.  CNG shipped back in in Windows Vista, and so it's available in every supported version of Windows.  CAPI doesn't serve the purpose of ""well, it has more coverage"" anymore, it's just ""the old, crufty, legacy API"" (unless you're writing code for out-of-support OSes, like XP).
If you are using CAPI, I don't know why you'd want to use the SChannel provider.  PROV_RSA_AES via MS_ENH_RSA_AES_PROV is the most functional RSA that CAPI has (SHA-2 based PKCS signatures).  But it's out of date compared to the software provider in CNG (PSS signature, OAEP with SHA-2, and supports public exponent values larger than 2^32 (okay, that's not a common need, but it's something CNG fixed)).

"56137510","CryptBinaryToString not outputting expected public key","I'm trying to output the original base64 form of an imported RSA public key using Windows CryptoAPI functions.  Using CryptBinaryToString with the CRYPT_STRING_BASE64HEADER flag, the output header reads ""BEGIN CERTIFICATE"" instead of expected ""BEGIN PUBLIC KEY"".  
(EDIT: I didn't highlight this part of my problem)
Furthermore, the resulting public key appears to be different than the original.
Will this become problematic if I were to export the output and reimport it? If so, what am I doing wrong?
Here's how the public key was imported.  
Public key is stored in file pubkey.pem in the following PEM format:
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
[REDACTED]
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

File is read into a buffer with CreateFile/ReadFile.
PEM converted to binary using CryptStringToBinaryA.
Binary is decoded to X509_PUBLIC_KEY_INFO using CryptDecodeObjectEx.
PubKeyInfo struct is decoded to RSA_CSP_PUBLICKEYBLOB (same function as above).
This part works just fine (can import the key and encrypt data with CryptImportKey, CryptEncrypt, etc).
Here's the code that I've put together to try and bring the raw blob back to base64 PEM format.  I've removed most error-checking to save headaches.
pbTmp and cbTmp are the temp buffer to hold output and size respectively.
pBinaryKey is the raw public key blob (imported from earlier)
pBuffer is the output buffer (assumed to be the correct size)
ulDataLen is the output buffer size
CryptEncodeObjectEx(X509_ASN_ENCODING, RSA_CSP_PUBLICKEYBLOB, pBinaryKey, 0, NULL, NULL, &cbTmp)
pbTmp = malloc(cbTmp);
CryptEncodeObjectEx(X509_ASN_ENCODING, RSA_CSP_PUBLICKEYBLOB, pBinaryKey, 0, NULL, pbTmp, &cbTmp)
CryptBinaryToStringA(pbTmp, cbTmp, CRYPT_STRING_BASE64HEADER, NULL, &ulDataLen)
CryptBinaryToStringA(pbTmp, cbTmp, CRYPT_STRING_BASE64HEADER, pBuffer, &ulDataLen)

The resulting buffer ends up with this:
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
[REDACTED; DIFFERENT FROM ORIGINAL PUBLIC KEY]
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

","According to the document:

CRYPT_STRING_BASE64HEADER(0x00000000):Base64, with certificate
  beginning and ending headers.

The expected header is ""BEGIN CERTIFICATE"". And there is no other flag parameter support for ""BEGIN PUBLIC KEY"". As @Jonathan Potter says, you can always use the CRYPT_STRING_BASE64 flag to encode without headers and then add the correct header yourself.

"37983297","When can CertGetCertificateChain return multiple simple certificate chains?","Why does CertGetCertificateChain have a facility to return more than one""simple chain""? What are simple chains and what other type of chains should I expect?
On a test run passing a certificate such as the following...
root
  |- parent
    |- my certificate 

...the result was one simple chain:
0. my certificate
1. parent
2. root

In what case will we see more than one simple chain returned?
","Multiple chains may appear whan there are multiple paths from single leaf certificate through multiple CA certificates.
This occurs in two (major) cases:

two or more CA certificates share the same Subject and public key. This happens when CA certificate is renewed with the same key pair. This will result in two very similar certificates which can be used as a node in the certification path building. They are different, but they both (since Subject and public key are shared) can be used to validate the signature of the issued certificate.
when cross-certification is used to provide additional paths to (possibly) a different root certificate. Litreally the same as above, with the exception that this option is used to provide routes to different CA roots.

Single certificate chain is just single path from a collection of all possible paths.

"24227169","How can I populate scatterlists from a buffer","Trying to use the linux crypto api to encrypt data coming in from a byte array buffer. Looking through the crypto folder source I came across sg_copy_from_buffer in scatterlist.c. It needs to know the number of entries as one of its parameters but I'm not sure what the unit of granularity is for one of the entries. Based on the incoming byte array, how can I decide the number of entries? This is for the latest version of the kernel 3.15. 
Also, what does sg stand for? Its used when instantiating pretty much every scatterlist but intuitively I would think of using sl.
","""SG"" stands for scatter/gather.
SG lists do not have a unit of granularity; entries can have any size.
The number of entries in an SG list can be determined with sg_nents().

","You have two display issues.
First: Passing a char value -- implicitly a signed char -- as an argument to printf() causes it to be extended to a signed int. As a result, passing a value with the high bit set (e.g, 0xe9, the second byte in your sample output) will cause it to be sign-extended to 0xffffffe9 and printed as such.
To fix this, declare output as an array of unsigned char, or the equivalent type u8.
Second: You are printing each byte using the %x format string, with no padding specified. This will cause values between 0x0 and 0xf to be printed as a single character instead of two, resulting in ambiguous output.
To fix this, use the %02x format string.

Can any one tell me what a CryptoAPI call means, I have already gone through many websites, but I really don't understand why do we use that? By making use of CryptoAPI what is that I achieve? How does that work...?
","CryptoApi (aka CAPI) is Microsoft's crypto library. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_CryptoAPI
It is used for things like encrypting files, but HTTPS is an entire protocol layer, it's more than just encryption.
If you are trying to secure a web service, then you don't need to write your own server crypto code.
Just bind the ASP.NET website to the HTTPS protocol in IIS (in addition to or in place of HTTP). When the client calls the API over HTTPS, the encryption process is invisible to the client and server yet the communication is still secure.
Here is an overview of how to setup IIS for HTTPS: https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate-installation-microsoft-iis-8.htm
Encryption is incredibly difficult to do correctly, even for crypto experts. So us mere mortal general programmers are encouraged to avoid writing our own encryption code as much as possible. HTTPS/SSL/TLS has its issues, but the good thing about it is that its implemented in a way that is largely invisible to the applications which make use of it.
Here's a general overview of how HTTPS works (aimed at web devs): https://blog.hartleybrody.com/https-certificates/

","I'm not familiar with Ruby at all, but I can make some assumptions. Correct me if I'm wrong.
You are converting source thumbprint (SHA1 value) to a string without spaces between octets:
thumbprint ||= ""1D F4 AB B6 13 F2 12 27 1C 04 F8 52 9D DE 38 E4 B7 24 2E 6C"" # Assume this is a valid thumbprint in Root
thumbprint.gsub!(/[^A-Za-z0-9]/, """") # Discard WhiteSpaces

This will result something like this: 1DF4ABB613F212271C04F8529DDE38E4B7242E6C and then you pass this string into CRYPT_HASH_BLOB constructor in this line:
pcert_context = CertFindCertificateInStore(certstore_handler, ENCODING_TYPE, 0, CERT_FIND_SHA1_HASH, CRYPT_HASH_BLOB.new(thumbprint), nil)

In the CRYPT_HASH_BLOB.initialize(str) you unpack the utf8 string to a byte array. First method is incorrect, because you treat input string as raw char array. Instead, it is a hex-encoded byte array, thus arr = [str].pack('H*').unpack('C*') line must be involved. At least, google suggests that this line will convert a series of octets to a corresponding byte array. So, method 3 is just fine with the exception that you must allocate *byte* array (not integer array) and write chars instead of ints. The correct constructor code should look like this:
def initialize(str)
    super(nil)
    if str
        # Converting thumbpring string into a byte array
        arr = [str].pack('H*').unpack('C*')

        # Method 3: Using Byte Array with FFI::MemoryPointer
        buffer3 = FFI::MemoryPointer.new(:char, arr.size) # Create the pointer to the array
        buffer3.write_array_of_char(arr) # Fill the memory location with data
        self[:pbData] = buffer3
        self[:cbData] = arr.size
    end
end

I believe, this will do the work.

"48894179","Code signing no longer working","We have a legacy Windows Workflow process that uses SignerSign to apply a digital signature to an EXE. We are migrating away from the Windows Workflow process, and so I have been preparing a tool within the context of our new process to perform the same signing operation. I copy/pasted the code signing code from the Workflow Activity to a class in the new project, but I am encountering an error when I try to run it.
The rough outline of what the code does is:

CertOpenStore is used to open the PFX file containing the private key and certificate.
A certificate context is obtained by calling CertEnumCertificatesInStore on the resulting certificate store handle.
SignerSign is called with a SIGNER_SUBJECT_INFO pointing at the target EXE file, a SIGNER_CERT pointing at the certificate context from the previous step and a SIGNATURE_SIGNER_INFO specifying that the SHA-1 algorithm should be used. (I have tried changing the algorithm to SHA-2 512 with no change in the outcome.) The pProviderInfo parameter is NULL.
A separate call is made to SignerTimeStamp to apply a timestamp to the signature. A comment in the code indicates that if the pwszHttpTimeStamp parameter to SignerSign is used, it returns HRESULT 0x80070020 (""File in use""?)

When I try to run this code on Windows 10 64-bit, whether from a 32-bit or 64-bit process, I get error HRESULT 0x80092006 ""No provider was specified for the store or object."". I tried supplying a pProviderInfo with the provider name set to ""Microsoft Strong Cryptographic Provider"" (seen in the API Monitor trace output for when SignTool.exe signs the executable -- this works) but it did not affect the outcome.
Does anyone know what exactly this error means and how to fix it?
","I have no idea at all why this worked, but by massaging my code so that does the same thing I see SignTool doing in Rohitab's API Monitor, and then paring bits away to what appears to be the minimal working set, this now signs files again:

Instead of CertOpenStore,. PFXImportCertStore is used to open the PFX file and produce an HCERTSTORE. This requires loading the PFX into memory so that it can be passed in as a CRYPT_DATA_BLOB -- no big deal.
A certificate context is obtained using CertEnumCertificatesInStore as before.
CertGetCertificateChain is used on the resulting certificate context with an unrestrictive CERT_CHAIN_PARA and flags CERT_CHAIN_DISABLE_PASS1_QUALITY_FILTERING |    CERT_CHAIN_RETURN_LOWER_QUALITY_CONTEXTS | CERT_CHAIN_REVOCATION_CHECK_CHAIN_EXCLUDE_ROOT. No additional store is specified. When I originally wrote this, based on the API Monitor results, I defined CERT_CHAIN_PARA_HAS_EXTRA_FIELDS and populated them the same way the API Monitor capture showed, but I continue to get S_OK from SignerSign with the short CERT_CHAIN_PARA structure as well.
SignerSign is called as before, except that a dummy collection-type store is passed in as the hCertStore of the SIGNER_CERT_STORE_INFO struct nested within the SIGNER_CERT. This dummy collection type store is created by calling CertOpenStore twice, once with CERT_STORE_PROV_COLLECTION and flag CERT_STORE_CREATE_NEW_FLAG and once with CERT_STORE_PROV_MEMORY specifying encodings PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING | X509_ASN_ENCODING, and then adding the memory store to the collection store using CertAddStoreToCollection.

If the dummy collection type store is not specified, then SignerSign complains that it cannot find a path to a trusted root. Note that the certificate I am using in my testing is self-signed, and thus doesn't have a path to a trusted root. Perhaps the dummy collection type store would not be necessary with a code signing certificate that does have a path to a trusted root, I do not presently have the means to test.
In any case, I hope this helps resolve this issue for anybody else who might have bumped into problems with SignerSign. :-)

Second update: changed decryption on the application side (After ""The following adapted from..."").
I have a text file which I encrypt on a source machine. The resulting file needs to be distributed to a number of destination machines and decrypted on the fly for presentation there. Transmission security is not an issue; our primary concern is with data integrity for reporting purposes; the end user should not be able to edit a free text file - hence, the encryption. On the source machine, my encryption and decryption work fine. This is the source encryption:
HCRYPTPROV m_hCryptProv;
HCRYPTKEY m_hSigKey;
HCRYPTKEY m_hExchKey;
HCRYPTHASH m_hHash;
CMemFile m_file;
CString m_strPassword;
CString m_strData;
CByteArray arData;
CFile file;
DWORD dwBlobLen = 0;
BYTE* pbKeyBlob;

CryptAcquireContext(&m_hCryptProv, NULL, NULL, PROV_RSA_FULL, 0);
CryptCreateHash(m_hCryptProv, CALG_MD5, 0, 0, &m_hHash);
CryptHashData(m_hHash, (const BYTE*)strPassword.GetString(), strPassword.GetLength() * sizeof(TCHAR), 0);
CryptDeriveKey(m_hCryptProv, CALG_RC2, m_hHash, CRYPT_EXPORTABLE, &m_hSigKey);

// m_strData is input to be encrypted
m_crypto.Encrypt(m_strData, arData);
file.Write(arData.GetData(), static_cast<UINT>(arData.GetCount()));
file.Flush();
file.Close();

// encrypted file ""file"" copied to target machine as ""GlobalOperator.dat"".

// Generate exchange key and write to file.
CryptGetUserKey(m_hCryptProv, AT_KEYEXCHANGE, &m_hExchKey);
CryptExportKey(m_hExchKey, 0, PUBLICKEYBLOB, 0, NULL, &dwBlobLen);
pbKeyBlob = (BYTE*)malloc(dwBlobLen);
//CryptExportKey(m_hExchKey, 0, PUBLICKEYBLOB, 0, NULL, &dwBlobLen);
CryptExportKey(m_hExchKey, 0, PUBLICKEYBLOB, 0, pbKeyBlob, &dwBlobLen);
file.Write(pbKeyBlob, dwBlobLen);
file.Flush();
file.Close();

// key file ""file"" copied to target machine as ""key.dat"".

The target machine(s) run an application an attempts to read the encrypted file:
CString m_strData;
CByteArray arData;
CFile GlobalOperatorFile;

GlobalOperatorFile.Open(""GlobalOperator.dat"")
arData.SetSize(static_cast<INT_PTR>(GlobalOperatorFile.GetLength()));
GlobalOperatorFile.Read(arData.GetData(), static_cast<UINT>(GlobalOperatorFile.GetLength()));
GlobalOperatorFile.Close();

// Try to deserialize the data.
DWORD dwBlobLen = 0;
CMemFile m_file;
m_file.SetLength(0);

//  Write the contents of the byte array to the memory file.
m_file.Write(arData.GetData(), static_cast<UINT>(arData.GetCount()));
m_file.Flush();

//  Acquire direct access to the memory file buffer.
BYTE* pData = m_file.Detach();

DWORD dwDataLength = static_cast<DWORD>(arData.GetCount());

// The following adapted from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/example-c-program-decrypting-a-file
CryptCreateHash(m_hCryptProv, CALG_MD5, 0, 0, &m_hHash);
CString pwd = ""EncryptionKey"";
CryptHashData(m_hHash, (const BYTE*)pwd.GetString(), pwd.GetLength() * sizeof(TCHAR), 0);
CryptDeriveKey(m_hCryptProv, CALG_RC2, m_hHash, CRYPT_EXPORTABLE, &m_hKey);
CryptDecrypt(m_hKey, NULL, TRUE, 0, pData, &dwDataLength);

// The above call to CryptDecrypt fails with error code 0x80090005: NTE_BAD_DATA


So I clearly have no idea what I'm doing with encryption/decryption.
Can anyone help?

"43911379","Data integrity in asyncronous CryptoApi in Linux","I work on implementation of driver for Linuc CryptoApi. Encryption/decryption will be performed in hardware and I want to use asynchronous operation of CryptoApi, which perfectly suitable for this purpose. Main purpose of driver is using with ipsec.
Citation from documentation: 

Asynchronous operation is provided by the kernel crypto API which implies that the invocation of a cipher operation will complete almost instantly. That invocation triggers the cipher operation but it does not signal its completion. Before invoking a cipher operation, the caller must provide a callback function the kernel crypto API can invoke to signal the completion of the cipher operation. Furthermore, the caller must ensure it can handle such asynchronous events by applying appropriate locking around its data. The kernel crypto API does not perform any special serialization operation to protect the caller’s data integrity.

Common mechanism of work: driver get query for processing data, make child process which will communicate with hardware, then driver(not child process) return special code(""in progress"") to caller. Caller now can create one else query or do another useful work. When data processing complete child process call callback function, which registered by caller, and die. 
But caller of the driver can be killed, for example, before data will be handled by hardware. If caller process not exist anymore in system, execution callback function can corrupt system. Besides that, before execution of callback function child process get encrypted/decrypted data from hardware and write it to some buffer, which was provided by caller. And this is one more scenario of system corruption. If caller not exist anymore driver should not use buffer.
How did kernel developers planned me to resolve this issue? What mechanism of synchronization between my driver and customer application should I use?
And I want to go back to upper citation:
Furthermore, the caller must ensure it can handle such asynchronous events by applying appropriate locking around its data. The kernel crypto API does not perform any special serialization operation to protect the caller’s data integrity.
I don't know, but it can concern to issue I research. In that case it's not problem of my driver to control data integrity. Then maybe it's a problem of ipsec level? For example, xfrm subsystem? 
Any comments or ideas, please?

Also bracnh is never used:

I'm sure doing something wrong?
","Regarding the first part of the question:

My problem is variable ""scratchpad"" (Input date) is the same value before and after launching it.

Since you are attempting to cipher in-place by passing the same scatter/gather list as a destination, this is a problem. They should not be the same.
To debug, you can:

Try other algorithms. I see from your /proc/crypto file that you have __cbc-aes-aesni. You may want to try that and others, to test the logic of your module.
Try cryptodev from userspace (/dev/crypto). It makes debugging much easier, by using cryptodev tests and examining dmesg. Adding enable_stats=1 to module options also helps. When your application is stable on userspace, it's up to you to go back to the kernel.

For the second part:

Also bracnh is never used:
if (rc)
       pr_info(""skcipher encrypt returned with result %d\n"", rc);


I would say this is not a problem.
Following the code sequence (referencing same kernel version v4.17 as your documentation link): 

crypto_wait_req takes an error code, in our case passed by crypto_skcipher_encrypt(). Unless the error is -EBUSY or -EINPROGRESS, this error code  is returned to rc, and zero is perfectly normal.
In turn, crypto_skcipher_encrypt returns 0 if the cipher operation was successful; < 0 if an error occurred. Since you've set a key, 0 should be returned.
I'll reference Intel's __cbc-aes-aesni as the driver. Checking cbc_encrypt(), you can see zero is the return value on success, as evidenced in the return value of skcipher_walk_done() in successful state.

Thus it is expected behaviour on successful operation that the branch is not called.

","I suspect your crash is coming here:
return std::string(reinterpret_cast<char*>(chunk));

chunk is a completely random sequence of bytes. It may have embedded nulls. It almost certainly does not end in null. This constructor requires a null-terminated sequence of characters. I suspect it's continuing to read bytes looking for a null until it hits an invalid address and crashes.
AES-encrypted data is not a string of characters. It is a just bytes. You need to treat it as such. You can return it as a vector<BYTE> or you could use a Base64- or hex-encoding function to convert it into a human-readable string if that's what you need. Be sure to decode this string before trying to decrypt it.

"55249755","CryptDecryptMessage returns CRYPT_E_NO_DECRYPT_CERT when executed inside service running under LSA","I created an RSA Certificate with a Private Key in LocalMachine/My store.
I then created a simple Windows console app in C to:

locate the cert by thumbprint
encrypt a buffer with CryptEncryptMessage
write the buffer out to a file

I then wrote a small service app, also in C to:

read the buffer
decrypt with CryptDecryptMessage

It all works fine as long as the service app is not running under the Local System Account (LSA). In that case, CryptDecryptMessage generates CRYPT_E_NO_DECRYPT_CERT (0x8009200C). This is despite that the Cert is in LocalMachine/My
I tried to strip down the code as much as possible but it is still rather long. I'm hoping there is some flag setting I am getting wrong. Or is this expected behavior? Thanks for taking a look.

","MD5 is probably available everywhere. CRC32 is so simple (and not really cryptography) that you can just include or implement it directly in your application.
The Windows crypto API supports multiple providers and the default provider is probably fully implemented in user mode without switching to kernel mode for most things. The PRng and AES encryption might be implemented in hardware.

","Some of the MSDN documentation is written by interns and the quality is not always great. They are clearly talking about issues related to calling this function from multiple threads at the same time, not just having multiple threads in the process.
If you look at some of the query values and how the API is designed it should be easy to spot the queries that cannot work with multiple threads. Anything that uses CRYPT_FIRST/NEXT (PP_*ENUM*) will have to rely on some internal state to remember ""where it is"". These queries have the thread warning in their description as well.
This does not mean that the other queries are thread safe but I would imagine that they are. You could debug the functions but things might change over time/versions and parts of the crypto system is extensible as well so you can never truly know without official information from Microsoft. You can add feedback to the MSDN page and hope that they update it.

","Maybe you've already worked around this, but I thought I'd answer anyway. Although I can't say for certainty what's happening.
That calls the SetPassword method on the native Windows IADsUser object. In the Remarks section of the documenation it describes 3 methods it tries to reset the password. It's possible that one of those methods is causing the pop-up, and when you click ""Don't allow"", it just moves on to the next.
The first one it uses is LDAP over SSL (LDAPS). I've never seen this, but there might be something weird with the way LDAPS is setup on your domain where it's asking for a client certificate maybe?
You can test this theory... In PowerShell, try this:
Invoke-WebRequest https://example.com:636

(Replace ""example.com"" with your domain name) You will either get a certificate error (maybe that same pop up?), but if the SSL handshake works then you should get a ""The underlying connection was closed"".
If you do get that pop up when trying through PowerShell, then I don't think there's anything you can do unless you're a domain admin. Something would have to change on the Domain Controller.

During encryption and decryption the m_hCryptProv have different values. Is it significant in this case? I am working so longer on this encryption work. Any help appreciated.
","You are using exchange key when export key, so you get a blob encrypted with a hXchgKey. During import you also need specify exchange key to decrypt blob:  
if (!CryptImportKey(
    m_hCryptProv,
    pbKeyBlob,
    dwBlobLen,
    hXchgKey,
    0,

  const BYTE *pbData,
  DWORD      dwDataLen,
  HCRYPTKEY  hPubKey,
  DWORD      dwFlags,

  If the key BLOB is encrypted with the key exchange key

","Chrome browser does not use Microsoft CAPI (CryptoAPI) for cryptographic services, but it includes the BoringSSL library instead. Hence, Chrome will not have access to your custom CSP module.

I have simplified the old methods to make it more compact (you could view it as pseudocode):
private UIntPtr mProviderHandle = UIntPtr.Zero;
private UIntPtr mHashHandle = UIntPtr.Zero;
private UIntPtr mKeyHandle = UIntPtr.Zero;
private uint mBlockSize = 0;
private bool m_disposed;

private void Init(string pContextName, string pSharedSecret)

    var providerFlags = ContextOperations.CRYPT_DEFAULT; // 0
    var hashAlg = ProviderAlgorithm.CALG_MD5; // 0x8003
    var keyAlg = ProviderAlgorithm.CALG_RC2; // 0x6602
    CryptAcquireContext(ref mProviderHandle, pContextName, providerName, providerType, providerFlags);

    CryptCreateHash(mProviderHandle, hashAlg, UIntPtr.Zero, 0, ref mHashHandle);

    CryptHashData(mHashHandle, Encoding.Default.GetBytes(pSharedSecret), (uint)pSharedSecret.Length, 0))

    CryptDeriveKey(mProviderHandle, keyAlg, mHashHandle, 0, ref mKeyHandle)); 
}

public byte[] Encrypt(byte[] pData, bool pFinal = true)
{
    uint length = (uint)bytes.Length;
    uint m = 0;

    if (0 < BlockSize)
    {
        // one more blocks than the number of blocks touched
        m = (uint)(((((length - 1) / BlockSize) + 1) + 1) * BlockSize);
        Array.Resize(ref bytes, (int)m);
    }
    else
    {
        m = length;
    }
    APIBOOL apiFinal = pFinal ? APIBOOL.TRUE : APIBOOL.FALSE;
    if (APIBOOL.FALSE != NativeMethods.CryptEncrypt(mKeyHandle, UIntPtr.Zero, apiFinal, 0,
            bytes, ref length, m))
    {
        Array.Resize(ref bytes, (int)length);
        encrypted = true;
    }

    return bytes;
}

And here is the new method:
private byte[] EncryptCNG(byte[] data, string pSharedSecret)
{
    using (RC2CryptoServiceProvider rc2 = new RC2CryptoServiceProvider())
    {
        using (MD5CryptoServiceProvider md5 = new MD5CryptoServiceProvider())
        {
            rc2.Key = md5.ComputeHash(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(pSharedSecret));
            rc2.IV = new byte[rc2.BlockSize/8];
        }
        var encryptor = rc2.CreateEncryptor();
        var result = encryptor.TransformFinalBlock(data, 0, data.Length);
        return result;
    }
}

Both methods Encrypt() and EncryptCNG() produce a byte array with the same length and constant value (depending on the input). But the values/bytes differ. The Desired result is that the same input generates identical output. So that Encrypt can be replaced by EncryptCNG.
My Questions are whether EncryptCNG is the correct way to use the new API and if it is a correct translation of the functionality of Init + Encrypt? And if it is, Why does it generates different results?
Any Help is much appreciated.

My questions are about to the possibility to develop and change or implement the keystore o a new CSP or KSP so this new crypto provider could access a central service/server/repository to present (authenticate), and sign documents every time a specific user needs it.
In the case of computer reinstallation, just installing the developed driver/csp, would give access to the central certificate repository.
The concrete questions are if you think it would be possible to develop that driver/CSP/KSP piece of software and what is your opinion about the possibilities to implement it successfully in a maintainable way into MS-Windows environments.  How would you focus this development?, just some tips about what it would be possible or not.

"57591760","Why is this decoding/encoding process giving a different buffer array?","I have the following represented as an ArrayBuffer:
const encryptedMsg = await crypto.subtle.encrypt(algorithm, key, messageUTF8)
The byte length of this value is 28:
encryptedMsg
// ArrayBuffer { byteLength: 28 }

When I convert this into a Uint8Array then I get the following values:
const encryptedMsgArr = new Uint8Array(encryptedMsg)
// Uint8Array(28) [ 237, 243, 213, 127, 248, 55, 37, 237, 209, 21, … ]

I want to convert this into a UTF-8 cyphertext with a standard decoder and later revert that with a standard encoder:
const encoder = new TextEncoder(""utf-8"");
const decoder = new TextDecoder(""utf-8"");

When decoding it:
const cypherText = decoder.decode(encryptedMsgArr)
""���\u007f�7%��\u0015\u00113\u0012\u0016�۹o׀.:+=��\u0015\u0015""

But when I try to encode it back into a Uint8Array then it doesn't match up even though utf-8 encoding was specified for both.
In fact the above doesn't even look like it's utf-8, and the byte length does not match up either (now 46 instead of 28):
encoder.encode(cypherText)
// Uint8Array(46) [ 239, 191, 189, 239, 191, 189, 239, 191, 189, 127, … ]

What am I doing wrong here?
Goal
To be able to export the cyphertext so it can be decrypted elsewhere at a later stage. If UTF-8 decoding of the ArrayBuffer doesn't work, the only other thing I can think of is to convert the AB into a stringified version of the array of integers and export that string, but I don't think that is a very sane methodology.
Edit
Actually, just declaring the encoder and decoder without utf-8 encoding fixes the issue, but @ornic has provided a nice base64 encoding/decoding function to use instead.
const encoder = new TextEncoder();
const decoder = new TextDecoder();

","AFAIK the most common way is to decode your bytes to ASCII text, not UTF-8.
Something like that (all that code is from my current project, I found almost all of it there, on SoF):
var bufferToBase64 = function (buffer) {
            var s = '';
            var uintArray = new Uint8Array(buffer);
            uintArray.filter(function (v) { s += String.fromCharCode(v); return false; });
            return window.btoa(s);
        };

var bytes = function (text) {
            return new Uint8Array(
               atob(text)
                  .split('')
                  .map(function (c) {
                       return c.charCodeAt(0);
                   })
            );
}

And the example of usage:
test = new Uint8Array([1, 5, 167, 12])
> Uint8Array(4) [1, 5, 167, 12]
test2 = bufferToBase64(test)
> ""AQWnDA==""
test3 = bytes(test2)
> Uint8Array(4) [1, 5, 167, 12]

"54531106","Changing the endianess of a PEM-encoded private/public key pair for the purpose of CryptoAPI-compatible signatures in libcrypto","I am writing a program which is able to sign and verify signatures originally made for CryptoAPI(The old Windows crypto library). The goal is to be able to sign/verify from linux.
However, i seem to be hitting a wall due to CryptoAPI and libcrypto having different endianess. 
I have alread tried to reverse the order of the signature to be verified(entire 128 byte RSA-encrypted chunk with padding and all). This does not seem to be enough, and i am struggling to find a proper straight forward recipe to do this easily.
I found from another stackoverflow post that you need to reverse the endianess of the actual key. Therefore, i am wondering if there is any easy way of doing this, where i preferably don't have to mess around with the data myself. 
I will stick to verification, as i assume the same workflow can be applied to a private key PEM. The situation is like this:
I have the public key as PEM, converted using the command
openssl rsa -pubin -inform MS\ PUBLICKEYBLOB -in pkey_mspublic.bin -outform PEM -out pubkey.pem

The following is how i load the PEM into libcrypto, and verify the signature:
BIO* certBio = BIO_new_mem_buf((void*)pubkey, -1);

RSA* rsa = NULL;
rsa = PEM_read_bio_RSA_PUBKEY(certBio, &rsa,NULL, NULL);

for (int i=0; i <signatureLength; i++)
{
   char tmp = expectedHashPtr[i];
   expectedHashPtr[i] = expectedHashPtr[signatureLength - 1 - i];
   expectedHashPtr[signatureLength - 1 - i] = tmp;
}

EVP_PKEY* pubKey  = EVP_PKEY_new();
EVP_PKEY_assign_RSA(pubKey, rsa);
std::cout << ""pubkey size: "" << EVP_PKEY_size(pubKey) << std::endl;
EVP_MD_CTX* mdctx = EVP_MD_CTX_create();

if(!(mdctx = EVP_MD_CTX_create())) std::cout << ""ctx create fail"" << std::endl;

if(1 != EVP_VerifyInit(mdctx, EVP_md5())) std::cout << ""digest init fail"" << std::endl;

if(1 != EVP_VerifyUpdate(mdctx, data, 512)) std::cout << ""digest fail"" << std::endl;

std::cout << ""finishing verify"" << std::endl;
if(1 == EVP_VerifyFinal(mdctx, (unsigned char*)expectedHashPtr, signatureLength, pubKey))
{
    /* Success */
    std::cout << ""Success"" << std::endl;
    return true;
}
else
{
    ERR_print_errors_fp(stderr);
    std::cout << ""Fail"" << std::endl;
    return false;
}

When i run the above code, i get padding errors, which i think is happening because my key is wrong endianess, and therefore wrong:
140278264301376:error:0407008A:rsa routines:RSA_padding_check_PKCS1_type_1:invalid padding:crypto/rsa/rsa_pk1.c:67:
140278264301376:error:04067072:rsa routines:rsa_ossl_public_decrypt:padding check failed:crypto/rsa/rsa_ossl.c:582:

So, my question is, is there a quick and easy way of handling endianess conversion of public and private key in PEM format? I do not want to do this by hand, as it has to scale.

"53886053","RC4 CryptoAPI to PHP port","I am trying to emulate a working CryptoAPI RC4 encrypt/decrypt routine in PHP.  When doing so, I've run into a problem trying to recreate the CryptCreateHash +CryptHashData process.  I'm trying to figure out how CryptoAPI orders/combines the raw data when calling CryptHashData multiple times.  
I have tried to concatenate the two input values to the key in different ways as well as reverse the byte order, but I'm not sure how to emulate the exact steps that CryptHashData performs.
For example:
// I create the hash variable, then hash a binary string using CryptHashData and then hash a secret using CryptHashData again.

BYTE baKeyRandom[10] = {87,253, ...};
::CryptCreateHash(hCryptProv, CALG_MD5, 0, 0, &hSaveHash);
::CryptHashData(hSaveHash, baKeyRandom, (DWORD)sizeof(baKeyRandom), 0);
::CryptHashData(hSaveHash, (LPBYTE)T2CW(pszSecret), (DWORD)_tcslen(pszSecret) * sizeof(WCHAR), 0); 

Then in PHP I'm trying to do something similar

// server key secret
$secret = 'ABCDEF-G...';

// random byte string
$random = pack('c*', 87,253, ...);

// simple concat does not work to generate an MD5 key
$key = md5($random.$secret);

So the question is how to emulate this step and match the C++ CryptoApi MD5 hash key in php, I have been unable to decrypt using this key or match the php key against the C++ exported key
