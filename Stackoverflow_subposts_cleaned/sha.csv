"18887823","Is it possible to decrypt SHA1","Is it possible to decrypt(retain the actual string) the password which is saved in db using SHA1 algorithm.
Example:If password is ""password"" and it is stored in db as ""sha1$4fb4c$2bc693f8a86e2d87f757c382a32e3d50fc945b24"",is any chance to retain the same ""password""(string) from ""sha1$4fb4c$2bc693f8a86e2d87f757c382a32e3d50fc945b24"" 
","SHA1 is a one way hash. So you can not really revert it.
That's why applications use it to store the hash of the password and not the password itself.
Like every hash function SHA-1 maps a large input set (the keys) to a smaller target set (the hash values). Thus collisions can occur. This means that two values of the input set map to the same hash value.
Obviously the collision probability increases when the target set is getting smaller. But vice versa this also means that the collision probability decreases when the target set is getting larger and SHA-1's target set is 160 bit.
Jeff Preshing, wrote a very good blog about Hash Collision Probabilities that can help you to decide which hash algorithm to use. Thanks Jeff.
In his blog he shows a table that tells us the probability of collisions for a given input set.

As you can see the probability of a  32-bit hash is 1 in 2 if you have 77163 input values.
A simple java program will show us what his table shows:
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char[] inputValue = new char[10];

        Map<Integer, String> hashValues = new HashMap<Integer, String>();

        int collisionCount = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < 77163; i++) {
            String asString = nextValue(inputValue);
            int hashCode = asString.hashCode();
            String collisionString = hashValues.put(hashCode, asString);
            if (collisionString != null) {
                collisionCount++;
                System.out.println(""Collision: "" + asString + "" <-> "" + collisionString);
            }
        }

        System.out.println(""Collision count: "" + collisionCount);
    }

    private static String nextValue(char[] inputValue) {
        nextValue(inputValue, 0);

        int endIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < inputValue.length; i++) {
            if (inputValue[i] == 0) {
                endIndex = i;
                break;
            }
        }

        return new String(inputValue, 0, endIndex);
    }

    private static void nextValue(char[] inputValue, int index) {
        boolean increaseNextIndex = inputValue[index] == 'z';

        if (inputValue[index] == 0 || increaseNextIndex) {
            inputValue[index] = 'A';
        } else {
            inputValue[index] += 1;
        }

        if (increaseNextIndex) {
            nextValue(inputValue, index + 1);
        }

    }

}

My output end with:
Collision: RvV <-> SWV
Collision: SvV <-> TWV
Collision: TvV <-> UWV
Collision: UvV <-> VWV
Collision: VvV <-> WWV
Collision: WvV <-> XWV
Collision count: 35135

It produced 35135 collsions and that's the nearly the half of 77163. And if I ran the program with 30084 input values the collision count is 13606. This is not exactly 1 in 10, but it is only a probability and the example program is not perfect, because it only uses the ascii chars between A and z.
Let's take the last reported collision and check 
System.out.println(""VvV"".hashCode());
System.out.println(""WWV"".hashCode());

My output is
86390
86390

Conclusion:
If you have a SHA-1 value and you want to get the input value back you can try a brute force attack. This means that you have to generate all possible input values, hash them and compare them with the SHA-1 you have. But that will consume a lot of time and computing power. Some people created so called rainbow tables for some input sets. But these do only exist for some small input sets.
And remember that many input values map to a single target hash value. So even if you would know all mappings (which is impossible, because the input set is unbounded) you still can't say which input value it was.

","SHA1 is a cryptographic hash function, so the intention of the design was to avoid what you are trying to do.
However, breaking a SHA1 hash is technically possible. You can do so by just trying to guess what was hashed. This brute-force approach is of course not efficient, but that's pretty much the only way.
So to answer your question: yes, it is possible, but you need significant computing power. Some researchers estimate that it costs $70k - $120k.
As far as we can tell today, there is also no other way but to guess the hashed input. This is because operations such as mod eliminate information from your input. Suppose you calculate mod 5 and you get 0. What was the input? Was it 0, 5 or 500? You see, you can't really 'go back' in this case.

","Since SHA-1 maps several byte sequences to one, you can't ""decrypt"" a hash, but in theory you can find collisions: strings that have the same hash.
It seems that breaking a single hash would cost about 2.7 million dollars worth of computer time currently, so your efforts are probably better spent somewhere else.

Also don't forget that you software (or a tiny part of it) might be deployed and simultaneously used in a gazillion of computers (some tiny embedded microcomputers that are almost everywhere nowadays included).

","The possibility of a collision does not depend on the size of the files, only on their number.
This is an example of the birthday paradox. The Wikipedia page gives an estimate of the likelihood of a collision. If you run the numbers, you'll see that all harddisks ever produced on Earth can't hold enough 1MB files to get a likelihood of a collision of even 0.01% for SHA-256.

","The usual answer goes thus: what is the probability that a rogue asteroid crashes on Earth within the next second, obliterating civilization-as-we-know-it, and killing off a few billion people? It can be argued that any unlucky event with a probability lower than that is not actually very important.
If we have a ""perfect"" hash function with output size n, and we have p messages to hash (individual message length is not important), then probability of collision is about p2/2n+1 (this is an approximation which is valid for ""small"" p, i.e. substantially smaller than 2n/2). For instance, with SHA-256 (n=256) and one billion messages (p=109) then the probability is about 4.3*10-60.
A mass-murderer space rock happens about once every 30 million years on average. This leads to a probability of such an event occurring in the next second to about 10-15. That's 45 orders of magnitude more probable than the SHA-256 collision. Briefly stated, if you find SHA-256 collisions scary then your priorities are wrong.
In a security setup, where an attacker gets to choose the messages which will be hashed, then the attacker may use substantially more than a billion messages; however, you will find that the attacker's success probability will still be vanishingly small. That's the whole point of using a hash function with a 256-bit output: so that risks of collision can be neglected.
Of course, all of the above assumes that SHA-256 is a ""perfect"" hash function, which is far from being proven. Still, SHA-256 seems quite robust.

","I'm not aware of a way to override the default md5 encryption of passwords, but if you have a ROLE (aka ""USER"") that has an already md5-encrypted password it appears that you can supply that. Verify this using pg_dumpall -g (to see the globals from the cluster)
Eg.
psql postgres

pg_dumpall -g | grep foo

","You may provide the password already hashed with md5, as said in the doc (CREATE ROLE):

ENCRYPTED UNENCRYPTED These key words control whether the password is
  stored encrypted in the system catalogs. (If neither is specified, the
  default behavior is determined by the configuration parameter
  password_encryption.) If the presented password string is already in
  MD5-encrypted format, then it is stored encrypted as-is, regardless of
  whether ENCRYPTED or UNENCRYPTED is specified (since the system cannot
  decrypt the specified encrypted password string). This allows
  reloading of encrypted passwords during dump/restore.

The information that's missing here is that the MD5-encrypted string should be the password concatened with the username, plus md5 at the beginning.
So for example to create u0 with the password foobar, knowing that md5('foobaru0') is ac4bbe016b808c3c0b816981f240dcae:
CREATE USER u0 PASSWORD 'md5ac4bbe016b808c3c0b816981f240dcae';

and then u0 will be able to log in by typing foobar as the password.
I don't think that there's currently a way to use SHA-256 instead of md5 for PostgreSQL passwords.

","If you're looking for a replacement for crypt(), newer versions of glibc have SHA-512-based ""$6$"" with a variable iteration count (see Ulrich Drepper's page, which has a description and links to a complete C implementation of sha512_crypt_r()).
Writing your own crypto is highly unadvisable — the above sha512(salt+password) doesn't help against a brute-force attack.
For generating salt, use something like os.urandom(16) for random bytes or ''.join(map(lambda x:'./0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[ord(x)%64], os.urandom(16))) for random base64-alike chars (for use with crypt()-alikes).

","SHA512 isn't a great way to store hashed passwords these days.  You should be using bcrypt or something similar.  What's important is that salting is built in and that the algorithm has a significant work factor.
If you salt your SHA512 passwords by simply appending (or prepending) the salt to the plaintext, anyone who gets their hands on a set of your hashed passwords and applies a modern cracking tool (http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/) will be able to see the concatenated password+salt values and will probably, through trivial pattern matching, be able to separate the password portion from the salt portion for most if not all of the accounts in question.
I haven't thought this through all the way, and I am by no means a security expert, but it seems to me that if you were to encrypt (using, for example, AES256) the password using the salt as the key, and then hash that with SHA512, you'd be safe from the vulnerability I described above.
However, at that point you've put in more effort than it would have taken to switch to bcrypt and you still wouldn't have the protection of a work factor, so I would only recommend an approach like that if the environment you're working in does not offer that option.

","The PHP function bin2hex means that it takes a string of bytes and encodes it as a hexadecimal number.
In the Java code, you are trying to take a bunch of random bytes and decode them as a string using your platform's default character encoding. That isn't going to work, and if it did, it wouldn't produce the same results.
Here's a quick-and-dirty binary-to-hex conversion for Java:
static String bin2hex(byte[] data) {
    StringBuilder hex = new StringBuilder(data.length * 2);
    for (byte b : data)
        hex.append(String.format(""%02x"", b & 0xFF));

This is quick to write, not necessarily quick to execute. If you are doing a lot of these, you should rewrite the function with a faster implementation.

Generally, eight to ten characters are more than enough to be unique

  unique.

7 digits is the Git default for a short SHA, so that's fine for most projects. The Kernel team have increased theirs several times, as mentioned, because the have several hundred thousand commits. So for your ~30k commits, 8 or 10 digits should be perfectly fine.

","Note: you can ask git rev-parse --short for the shortest and yet unique SHA1.
See ""git get short hash from regular hash""
git rev-parse --short=4 921103db8259eb9de72f42db8b939895f5651489
92110


As you can see in my example the SHA1 has a length of 5 even if I specified a length of 4.


For big repos, 7 isn't enough since 2010, and commit dce9648 by Linus Torvalds himself (git 1.7.4.4, Oct 2010):

The default of 7 comes from fairly early in git development, when seven hex digits was a lot (it covers about 250+ million hash values).
  Back then I thought that 65k revisions was a lot (it was what we were about to hit in BK), and each revision tends to be about 5-10 new objects or so, so a million objects was a big number.

(BK = BitKeeper)

These days, the kernel isn't even the largest git project, and even the kernel has about 220k revisions (much bigger than the BK tree ever was) and we are approaching two million objects.
  At that point, seven hex digits is still unique for a lot of them, but when we're talking about just two orders of magnitude difference between number of objects and the hash size, there will be collisions in truncated hash values.
  It's no longer even close to unrealistic - it happens all the time.
We should both increase the default abbrev that was unrealistically small, and add a way for people to set their own default per-project in the git config file.

core.abbrev


Set the length object names are abbreviated to.
  If unspecified, many commands abbreviate to 7 hexdigits, which may not be enough for abbreviated object names to stay unique for sufficiently long time.

environment.c:
int minimum_abbrev = 4, default_abbrev = 7;

Note: As commented below by marco.m, core.abbrevLenght was renamed in core.abbrev in that same Git 1.7.4.4 in commit a71f09f 

Rename core.abbrevlength back to core.abbrev
It corresponds to --abbrev=$n command line option after all.


More recently, Linus added in commit e6c587c (for Git 2.11, Q4 2016):
(as mentioned in Matthieu Moy's answer)

In fairly early days we somehow decided to abbreviate object names down to 7-hexdigits, but as projects grow, it is becoming more and more likely to see such a short object names made in earlier days and recorded in the log messages no longer unique.
Currently the Linux kernel project needs 11 to 12 hexdigits, while Git itself needs 10 hexdigits to uniquely identify the objects they have, while many smaller projects may still be fine with the original 7-hexdigit default.  One-size does not fit all projects.
Introduce a mechanism, where we estimate the number of objects in the repository upon the first request to abbreviate an object name with the default setting and come up with a sane default for the repository.  Based on the expectation that we would see collision in a repository with 2^(2N) objects when using object names shortened to first N bits, use sufficient number of hexdigits to cover the number of objects in the repository.
  Each hexdigit (4-bits) we add to the shortened name allows us to have four times (2-bits) as many objects in the repository.

See commit e6c587c (01 Oct 2016) by Linus Torvalds (torvalds).
See commit 7b5b772, commit 65acfea (01 Oct 2016) by Junio C Hamano (gitster).
(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit bb188d0, 03 Oct 2016) 
That new property (guessing a reasonnable default for SHA1 abbrev value) has a direct effect on how Git compute its own version number for release.

","This question has been answered, but for anyone looking for the math behind - it's called Birthday problem (Wikipedia).
It is about the probability of having 2 (or more) people from group of N people to have birthday on the same day in year. Which is analogical to probabily of 2 (or more) git commits from repository having N commits in total having the same hash prefix of length X.
Look at the Probability table. For example for hash hex string of length 8 the probability of having a collision reaches 1 % when the repository has just about 9300 items (git commits). For 110 000 commits the probability is 75 %. But if you have hash hex string of length 12 the probability of collision in 100 000 commits is below 0.1 %.

","Git version 2.11 (or perhaps 2.12?) will contain a feature that adapts the number of characters used in short identifiers (e.g. git log --oneline) to the size of the project. Once you use such version of Git, the answer to your question can be ""pick whatever length Git gives you with git log --oneline, it's safe enough"".

","This is known as the birthday problem.
For probabilities less than 1/2 the probability of a collision can be approximated as
p ~= (n2)/(2m)
Where n is the number of items and m is the number of possibilities for each item.
The number of possibilities for a hex string is 16c where c is the number of characters.
So for 8 characters and 30K commits
30K ~= 215
p ~= (n2)/(2m) ~= ((215)2)/(2*168) = 230/233 = ⅛
Increasing it to 12 characters
p ~= (n2)/(2m) ~= ((215)2)/(2*1612) = 230/249 = 2-19

","Finally I get the answer and it works well. As described in No such method error in Apache codec for another type of encrypt (Base64) I tried to reproduce the same issue and I get exactly the same error. So I was in the case of the question attached. As they say, it seems to be an internal name collision with the package name org.apache.commons.codec and as stated by @Don I changed it to com.apache.commons.codec and worked fine! How I did it?
I downloaded the source code and changed the 3 directories org to com. I also replaced all the occurrences of the package name in the files where they appear and also changed the references in the docs to com/apache/commons/codec/. (Do not try to remane them manually or you will spend the hole day). Then I compiled the library and generated the jar with Ant, which I called commons-codec-1.6-android.jar. I put the jar in the libs/ folder of my Android app and added it to the buildpath. Also, I attached the sources as the folder which contains all the files. So now I have the library ready to use with Android!
Hope that it helps someone else!

","I ran into the same issue trying to use DigestUtils in my Android app. This was the best answer I could find by searching, but I was reluctant to rebuild the .jar file with the namespace changed. After spending some time on this issue, I found an easier way to solve the problem for my case. The problem statement for my code was 
String s = DigestUtils.md5Hex(data);

Replace this statement with the following and it will work:
String s = new String(Hex.encodeHex(DigestUtils.md5(data)));

Similarly, for shaHex exampl, you can change it to
String hash = new String(Hex.encodeHex(DigestUtils.sha(""textToHash"")));

This works because even though Android does not have encodeHexString(), it does have encodeHex(). Hope this would help others who run into the same issue.

UPDATE:
As this is a very active question, I've changed the accepted answer in favour of @DA25, as his solution is straightforward and the high number of upvotes prove that it works.
","Since there's no clear answer for the root cause of this problem, I'd like to clarify what's happening here.
Why the NoSuchMethodError is thrown in the first place?
According to exception stack trace, the line that causes the fault is 226 in DigestUtils#md5hex method. Let's see what we have there (I'm assuming you have used version 1.4, since this is the only release where Hex#encodeHexString method is being invoked in line 226):
public static String md5Hex(String data) {
    return Hex.encodeHexString(md5(data));
}

The exception says java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Hex.encodeHexString.
Let's understand why.  
First of all, Android framework already includes the Commons Codec library (except the DigestUtils class). Yes, it is not exposed as part of the Android SDK and you cannot use it directly. But you still want to use it. So what you do? You add Commons Codec library as part of your application. The compiler doesn't complain - from his point of view everything was fine.
But what happens at runtime? Let's follow your exception stack trace:
First, you're calling DigestUtils#md5Hex from your Activity's onCreate method. As I wrote above, the framework doesn't include that class, so DigestUtils (from Commons Codec version 1.4) is loaded from your dex.
Next, md5hex method tries to invoke Hex#encodeHexString method. Hex class is part of the Commons Codec library that included in framework. The thing is that its version is 1.3 (ancient release from July 2004). Hex class exists in boot classpath, which means that the runtime will always favor it instead of the Hex class that packaged inside your dex. You can see warnings about it in your application logs when you start your app (with Dalvik runtime):  
D/dalvikvm? DexOpt: 'Lorg/apache/commons/codec/binary/Hex;' has an earlier definition; blocking out
I/dalvikvm? DexOpt: not resolving ambiguous class 'Lorg/apache/commons/codec/binary/Hex;'
D/dalvikvm? DexOpt: not verifying/optimizing 'Lorg/apache/commons/codec/binary/Hex;': multiple definitions
I/dalvikvm? Could not find method org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Hex.encodeHexString, referenced from method org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils.md5Hex

Hex#encodeHexString method was introduced in version 1.4 of Commons Codec library and therefore it doesn't exist in framework's Hex class. The runtime can't find this method and thus throws NoSuchMethodError exception.
Why the accepted answer's solution works?
String s = new String(Hex.encodeHex(DigestUtils.md5(data)));

First, DigestUtils#md5 method is called. As I already stated, DigestUtils class that will be used is the one that packaged in your dex. This method doesn't use any other Commons Codec classes, so no problem with it.  
Next, Hex#encodeHex will be called. The Hex class that will be used is the framework's one (version 1.3). The encodeHex method (that takes a single parameter - byte array) exists in version 1.3 of Commons Codec library, and therefore this code will work fine.
What would I suggest?
My suggested solution is to rename the classes namespace/package. By doing so I'm explicitly specifying which code is going to execute, and prevent bizarre behavior that may occur because of versioning issues.  
You can do it manually (as Caumons wrote in his answer), or automatically with jarjar tool.  
See this issue summary and tips for using jarjar in my blogpost.

","Another way to rename DigestUtils class will be with proguard.
If you are not using proguard you can enable it and add this one line which will obfuscate only DigestUtils class, and leave everything else intact.
-keep class !org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils,com.** { *; }

and add this to your app build.gradle
buildTypes {
        debug {
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'

        release {

            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }

Or OPTION 2
Use old version of the library in your code:
implementation(""commons-codec:commons-codec:1.3""){
        force = true
    }

Need to use force = true if common-codec dependency come from third part library otherwise Gradle will resolve by default to higher version.

","SHA-2 is stronger and better suited to security-sensitive applications such as digital signing.
SHA-1 is good when you need a shorter hash and security is not an issue (e.g., file checksums).
Edit: SHA-1 algorithm is faster (up to 10 times faster than SHA-2 with 256 bits, and 20 times faster than SHA-2 with 512 bits - at least in the .NET implementation).
However, neither are really that slow: to put it in perspective, you can expect to hash a 100KB file with SHA-2 (256 bit) in a few milliseconds on a modern computer (or a 1MB file in a few tens of milliseconds).

","Use SHA-2. Always. SHA-1 shall be reserved to situations where SHA-2 cannot be used due to interoperability issues with legacy code.
There is no performance issue until actual measures have been performed. Hash functions are fast. In most situations, hash function performance has only negligible impact; even detecting it could prove difficult. Security comes first. Since weaknesses have been found in SHA-1, using it nonetheless requires some robust justification. Using SHA-256 will not be questioned; this is the ""default choice"". But if you use SHA-1, prepare to be criticized.
Note that there are four functions known as ""SHA-2"": SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512. SHA-224 and SHA-256 are the same function, save for an internal parameter (the ""initial value"") and the output size (SHA-224 output size is 28 bytes, whereas SHA-256 offers 32 bytes); they have the same performance characteristics. Similarly, SHA-384 and SHA-512 are the same function performance-wise. SHA-512 uses 64-bit arithmetic operations and is faster than SHA-256 on platforms which offer 64-bit opcodes; on 32-bit platforms, SHA-256 will be faster (note: on 32-bit x86 with native code, it is possible to use the SSE2 opcodes and their 64-bit computing abilities, hence some native code implementations of SHA-512 will be faster than SHA-256 in 32-bit mode; the OpenSSL code does that; but, as far as I know, the SHA-512 implementation in .NET is ""managed code""). Also, all the SHA-* functions have some basic granularity, because they process data by chunks: for SHA-256, chunks are 64-byte long, whereas SHA-512 uses 128-byte chunks; when hashing very short data elements, the higher SHA-512 granularity correspondingly lowers its performance. Finally, SHA-256 (on a 32-bit platform) is likely to yield smaller code (i.e. use less L1 cache on the CPU).
So, when in doubt, use SHA-256. If you plan on using SHA-1 then you should doubt.
If you want to use a hash function for a non-cryptographic usage (i.e. the weaknesses are not a problem for you) then, instead of SHA-1, consider MD4.

","SHA is a digest algorithm, not an encryption algorithm. Digest values are not decryptable. That's why they are secure. Two different inputs may give same digest values. But it is a very little possibility. For sha256 it is 1/(2^256).
Output of digest algorithms have constant length. For SHA256 it is always 256 bit, regardless of your input length, 1  bit or 100 Gbs. If we could decrypt 256 bit digest value and have the original 1Gb input back, we would never need compression algorithms :)

If you are using Spring Security 3.1, the recommended approach would be to go for bcrypt, this automatically generates a salt and concatenates it.
<beans:bean id='bCryptPasswordEncoder' class='org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder'/>

<authentication-manager>
  <authentication-provider user-service-ref=""userDetailsService"">

You can generate the user password like this:

","The principle behind salting hashes is that you are not vulnerable to rainbow tables. If you use static salt then its possible (but expensive) for someone to build a rainbow table for your salt. If the pickings are sweet, someone will do it.
Ideally your salt should be random (eg use bytes from a SecureRandom) and should be different for each user. You should store the salt alongside the hashed password, eg if you are using a database table then simply have a salt column.
The latest versions of Spring Security (3.1 and later) try to handle salt in an automatic, transparent manner. The password encoder will automatically generate random salt and append it to the hash instead of storing it separately (eg in different columns). Because hashes and the salt have a fixed length it is easy to determine which part of the data is which.

As mentioned in other answers, you still have to follow the rules. This works in only the very narrow case where you have the exact same branch, parents, and committer (such as with a code-review-centric process where you have a bunch of commits queued up somewhere, where the developers can push them up and bring them down without necessarily submitting them into the repository first); really only when the timestamps are the only thing that might have changed. In this case, you can force the identical revision in order to force the timestamps to be unchanged. 
In most other cases, the parent will usually be different, and, this alone, means that your dream of forcing a certain revision will be dead. Git will always fix-up the revision to be correct if any of the non-timestamp factors are different.

There are enhancement requests like issue #4507 reported to add such a filter, though it is unlikely that this will get implemented in Firebug, especially not in version 2.x, directly.
Firebug 3 will integrate into the built-in DevTools, which allow you to filter those warnings by unchecking Warnings within the Security menu inside the Console panel:

I've thought of two possible ways to accomplish this, but both seem rather clunky.
1) Add a boolean ""flag"" field. The first time the user authenticates after this, replace the MD5 password hash with the SHA password hash, and set the flag. I can then check the flag to see whether the password hash has been converted.
2) Add a second password field to store the SHA hash. The first time the user authenticates after this, hash the password with SHA and store it in the new field (probably delete their MD5 hash at the same time). Then I can check whether the SHA field has a value; this essentially becomes my flag.
In either case, the MD5 authentication would have to remain in place for some time for any users who log in infrequently. And any users who are no longer active will never be switched to SHA.
Is there a better way to do this?
","Essentially the same, but maybe more elegant than adding extra fields: In the default authentication framwork in Django, the password hashes are stored as strings constructed like this:
hashtype$salt$hash

Hashtype is either sha1 or md5, salt is a random string used to salt the raw password and at last comes the hash itself. Example value:
sha1$a1976$a36cc8cbf81742a8fb52e221aaeab48ed7f58ab4

","You can convert all your MD5 Strings to SHA1 by rehashing them in your DB if you create your future passwords by first MD5ing them. Checking the passwords requires MD5ing them first also, but i dont think thats a big hit.
php-code (login):
prev:
$login = (md5($password) == $storedMd5PasswordHash);
after:
$login = (sha1(md5($password)) == $storedSha1PasswordHash);
Works also with salting, got the initial idea from here.

        System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2 thisCert = LoadCertificate();
        if (thisCert != null)

            Console.WriteLine(""Verifying Signature"");

            if (VerifySignature(thisCert.PublicKey.Key.ToXmlString(false), signature, ""Mary had a nuclear bomb.""))
                Console.WriteLine(""Valid Signature!"");
            else
                Console.WriteLine(""Signature NOT valid!"");

        }

When I attempt to run the test app, I am getting the error ""Key not valid for use in specified state."" on the line:
    string signature = SignData(""Mary had a nuclear bomb"", thisCert.PublicKey.Key.ToXmlString(true));

I tried replacing the ""PublicKey.Key"" with ""PrivateKey"" but that did not make a difference.  I also tried using the BounceyCastle X509Certificate but I could not figure out how to extract the keys.  Any ideas?
Thank you!
UPDATE:  I did figure out how to sign and verify with just .NET but that is not really useful to me as I need to be cross platform and, in fact, our main client app is written in Java.  Does anybody know the Bouncy Castle equivalent to the following code?

                return stringWriter.GetStringBuilder().ToString();
            }
        }
    }

    public bool VerifyXmlSignature(string XmlMessage, X509Certificate2 ThisCert)

        XmlDocument xmlDocument = new XmlDocument();

        // Load the passed XML file into the document. 
        xmlDocument.LoadXml(XmlMessage);

        // Create a new SignedXml object and pass it the XML document class.
        SignedXml signedXml = new SignedXml(xmlDocument);

        // Find the ""Signature"" node and create a new XmlNodeList object.

","Bouncy Castle doesn't support XML formats at all. Unless your use-case strictly requires it, you'll find it much easier going just to use Base64 encodings, with certificates (X.509) and private keys (PKCS#8) stored in PEM format. These are all string formats, so should be usable with JSON directly.
There are other problems in the code samples: signing should use the private key, signatures shouldn't be treated as ASCII strings, possibly your messages are actually UTF8. I would expect the inner sign/verify routines to perhaps look like this:
    public string SignData(string msg, ECPrivateKeyParameters privKey)
    {
        try
        {
            byte[] msgBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(msg);

            ISigner signer = SignerUtilities.GetSigner(""SHA-256withECDSA"");
            signer.Init(true, privKey);
            signer.BlockUpdate(msgBytes, 0, msgBytes.Length);
            byte[] sigBytes = signer.GenerateSignature();

            return Convert.ToBase64String(sigBytes);
        }
        catch (Exception exc)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""Signing Failed: "" + exc.ToString());
            return null;
        }
    }

    public bool VerifySignature(ECPublicKeyParameters pubKey, string signature, string msg)
    {
        try
        {
            byte[] msgBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(msg);
            byte[] sigBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(signature);

            ISigner signer = SignerUtilities.GetSigner(""SHA-256withECDSA"");
            signer.Init(false, pubKey);
            signer.BlockUpdate(msgBytes, 0, msgBytes.Length);
            return signer.VerifySignature(sigBytes);
        }
        catch (Exception exc)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""Verification failed with the error: "" + exc.ToString());
            return false;
        }
    }

A further issue is that I think .NET didn't get ECDSA support until .NET 3.5, in any case there's no ECDsa class in .NET 1.1 (which is BC's target for the upcoming 1.8 release - we will be ""modernising"" after that), so DotNetUtilities doesn't have support for ECDSA. However, we can export to PKCS#12 and import to BC. An example program:
    public void Program()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""Attempting to load cert..."");
        System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2 thisCert = LoadCertificate();

        Console.WriteLine(thisCert.IssuerName.Name);
        Console.WriteLine(""Signing the text - Mary had a nuclear bomb"");

        byte[] pkcs12Bytes = thisCert.Export(X509ContentType.Pkcs12, ""dummy"");
        Pkcs12Store pkcs12 = new Pkcs12StoreBuilder().Build();
        pkcs12.Load(new MemoryStream(pkcs12Bytes, false), ""dummy"".ToCharArray());

        ECPrivateKeyParameters privKey = null;
        foreach (string alias in pkcs12.Aliases)
        {
            if (pkcs12.IsKeyEntry(alias))
            {
                privKey = (ECPrivateKeyParameters)pkcs12.GetKey(alias).Key;
                break;
            }
        }

        string signature = SignData(""Mary had a nuclear bomb"", privKey);

        Console.WriteLine(""Signature: "" + signature);

        Console.WriteLine(""Verifying Signature"");

        var bcCert = DotNetUtilities.FromX509Certificate(thisCert);
        if (VerifySignature((ECPublicKeyParameters)bcCert.GetPublicKey(), signature, ""Mary had a nuclear bomb.""))
            Console.WriteLine(""Valid Signature!"");
        else
            Console.WriteLine(""Signature NOT valid!"");
    }

I haven't really tested any of the above code, but it should give you something to go on. Note that BC has key and certificate generators too, so you could choose to use BC for everything (except XML!), and export/import to/from .NET land only where necessary.

Those answers were great and really helped me ramp up quickly!
That said, I need to create a client that can pass through WCF JSON calls a public key to be used later for signature verification and I cannot seem to get this to work.  First here is the code I use to generate the Certificate:
    public System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2 LoadCertificate()
    {
        System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2 returnX509 = null;
        //X509Certificate returnCert = null;

        try
        {
            returnX509 = new System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2(CertificateName, CertificatePassword);
            //returnCert = DotNetUtilities.FromX509Certificate(returnX509);
        }
        catch
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""Failed to obtain cert - trying to make one now."");

            try
            {
                Guid nameGuid = Guid.NewGuid();
                AsymmetricCipherKeyPair kp;
                var x509 = GenerateCertificate(""CN=Server-CertA-"" + nameGuid.ToString(), out kp);
                SaveCertificateToFile(x509, kp, CertificateName, CertificateAlias, CertificatePassword);
                returnX509 = new System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2(CertificateName, CertificatePassword);
                //returnCert = DotNetUtilities.FromX509Certificate(returnX509);
                Console.WriteLine(""Successfully wrote and retrieved cert!"");
            }

            {
                Console.WriteLine(""Failed to create cert - exception was: "" + exc.ToString());
            }
        }

        return returnX509;
    }

With that completed, I then use the following code to sign a message:
    public string SignData(string Message, string PrivateKey)
    {
        try
        {
            byte[] orgBytes = UnicodeEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(Message);

            ECDomainParameters ecSpec = new ECDomainParameters(ecP.Curve, ecP.G, ecP.N, ecP.H, ecP.GetSeed());

            ISigner signer = SignerUtilities.GetSigner(""SHA-256withECDSA"");
            BigInteger biPrivateKey = new BigInteger(privateKey);
            ECPrivateKeyParameters keyParameters = new ECPrivateKeyParameters(biPrivateKey, ecSpec);

            signer.Init(true, keyParameters);
            signer.BlockUpdate(orgBytes, 0, orgBytes.Length);

            byte[] data = signer.GenerateSignature();
            //Base64 Encode
            byte[] encodedBytes;
            using (MemoryStream encStream = new MemoryStream())
            {
                base64.Encode(orgBytes, 0, orgBytes.Length, encStream);
                encodedBytes = encStream.ToArray();
            }

            if (encodedBytes.Length > 0)
                return UnicodeEncoding.ASCII.GetString(encodedBytes);
            else

        }
    }

And, finally, my attempt to verify:

","No, message length does not effect the likeliness of a collision.
If that were the case, the algorithm is broken.
You can try for yourself by running SHA against all one-byte inputs, then against all two-byte inputs and so on, and see if you get a collision. Probably not, because no one has ever found a collision for SHA-256 or SHA-512 (or at least they kept it a secret from Wikipedia)

","Depends very much on your application: if you were simply hashing ""YES"" and ""NO"" strings to send across a network to indicate whether you should give me a $100,000 loan, it would be a pretty big failure -- the domain of answers can't be that large, so someone could easily check observed hashes on the wire against a database of 'small input' hash outputs.
If you were to include the date, time, my name, my tax ID, the amount requested, the amount of data being hashed probably won't amount to much, but the chances of that data being in precomputed hash tables is pretty slim.
But I know of no research to point you to beyond my instincts. Sorry.

","A hash function accepts inputs of arbitrary (or at least very high) length, and produces a fixed-length output. There are more possible inputs than possible outputs, so collisions must exist. The whole point of a secure hash function is that it is ""collision resistant"", which means that while collisions must mathematically exist, it is very very hard to actually compute one. Thus, there is no known collision for SHA-256 and SHA-512, and the best known methods for computing one (by doing it on purpose) are so ludicrously expensive that they will not be applied soon (the whole US federal budget for a century would buy only a ridiculously small part of the task).
So, if it cannot be realistically done on purpose, you can expect not to hit a collision out of (bad) luck.
Moreover, if you limit yourself to very short inputs, there is a chance that there is no collision at all. E.g., if you consider 12-byte inputs: there are 296 possible sequences of 12 bytes. That's huge (more than can be enumerated with today's technology). Yet, SHA-256 will map each input to a 256-bit value, i.e. values in a much wider space (of size 2256). We cannot prove it formally, but chances are that all those 296 hash values are distinct from each other. Note that this has no practical consequence: there is no measurable difference between not finding a collision because there is none, and not finding a collision because it is extremely improbable to hit one.
Just to illustrate how low risks of collision are with SHA-256: consider your risks of being mauled by a gorilla escaped from a local zoo or private owner. Unlikely? Yes, but it still may conceivably happen: it seems that a gorilla escaped from the Dallas zoo in 2004 and injured four persons; another gorilla escaped from the same zoo in 2010. Assuming that there is only one rampaging gorilla every 6 years on the whole Earth (not only in the Dallas area) and you happen to be the unlucky chap who is on his path, out of a human population of 6.5 billions, then risks of grievous-bodily-harm-by-gorilla can be estimated at about 1 in 243.7 per day. Now, take 10 thousands of PC and have them work on finding a collision for SHA-256. The chances of hitting a collision are close to 1 in 275 per day -- more than a billion less probable than the angry ape thing. The conclusion is that if you fear SHA-256 collisions but do not keep with you a loaded shotgun at all times, then you are getting your priorities wrong. Also, do not mess with Texas.

","There is no minimum input size. SHA-256 algorithm is effectively a random mapping and collision probability doesn't depend on input length. Even a 1 bit input is 'safe'.
Note that the input is padded to a multiple of 512 bits (64 bytes) for SHA-256 (multiple of 1024 for SHA-512). Taking a 12 byte input (as Thomas used in his example), when using SHA-256, there are 2^96 possible sequences of length 64 bytes.
As an example, a 12 byte input Hello There! (0x48656c6c6f20546865726521) will be padded with a one bit, followed by 351 zero bits followed by the 64 bit representation of the length of the input in bits which is 0x0000000000000060 to form a 512 bit padded message. This 512 bit message is used as the input for computing the hash.

","Your best bet would be the truncating well-known hash function (MD5 or SHA-family) because these algorithms have statistically good uniform distributions of the hash values (and also using full hash and not just 6 chars there).
Now some calculations for probability of collision

- Number of letters in English alphabet: 26
- Add capitals: 26
- Add numerics: 10
--------------

In total you get 26 + 26 + 10 = 62 characters. 

Now you have 6 places, which gives you 62^6 possible combinations.
That is 56.800.235.584 ~ 57 billion combinations. 
This is a space of possible hash values - N.
--------------
To compute collisions let's use the formula 

Pcollision = K^2 / 2N

Which is a very rough approximation of collision probability


Now let's see the result table for a number of items in a table - K

# items     | Probability of collision
---------------------------------------
10          |  1.7 * 10^-9
100         |  1.7 * 10^-7
1K          |  1.7 * 10^-5
10K         |  1.7 * 10^-3
100K        |  0.17

This formula can only be used for small K, but it shows that given 100K entries in the hash table you would roughly have 17% chance of collision.

","The best solution is almost certainly to use SHA1, convert to Base62 (although Base64 would be much easier as it's built in to the framework Convert.ToBase64String. You'll have to do some looking for a decent Base62 library), and then truncate the output to 6 bytes.
I would not use GetHashCode() as it has a history of collision problems. (I'm not trying to claim that this specific bug would apply to you, only mentioning this as evidence that GetHashCode hasn't been implemented well in the past.)
I also would not implement a custom hashing algorithm, it's extremely easy to accidentally write an algorithm with a high collision rate. A lot of research and scrutiny has gone in to SHA1 and the other major hashing algorithms, and you'd be very hard pressed to come up with anything better.

Note that some things have dependencies.  For example, you cannot build the SSL library without ciphers and digest algorithms because the SSL and TLS protocols demand them.  So instead of doing make all, you want to do make build_crypto so that it only builds libcrypto.a.
Through experimentation, I found (in OpenSSL 0.9.8r) that libcrypto has 2 algorithm dependencies:  MD5 for the random-number generator's algorithm (in crypto/rand_lib.c) and SHA-1 for printing certificate hashes (in crypto/asn1/t_x509.c).  I'd say these dependencies are oversights by the developers.
This is how I build libcrypto.a with only MD5 and SHA:
./config no-idea no-aes no-camellia no-seed no-bf no-cast no-des no-rc2 no-rc4 no-rc5 \
no-md2 no-md4 no-ripemd no-mdc2 no-rsa no-dsa no-dh no-ec no-ecdsa no-ecdh no-sock \
no-ssl2 no-ssl3 no-err no-krb5 no-engine no-hw
make depend
make build_crypto

I also successfully built it with everything except AES, RSA, SHA, and MD5 as the question asked.

","That is not possible out of the box
The OpenJDK implementation does only provide a PBKDF2HmacSHA1Factory.java which has the ""HmacSHA1"" digest harcoded. As far as I tested, the Oracle JDK is not different in that sense.
What you have to do is derive the PBKDF2HmacSHA1Factory (come on, it is open!) and add a parameter to its constructor. You may avoid the mess of creating your own Provider, and just initialize and use your factory as follows:
PBKDF_SecretKeyFactory kf = new PBKDF_SecretKeyFactory(""HmacSHA512"");
KeySpec ks = new PBEKeySpec(password,salt,iterations,bitlen);
byte key[] = kf.engineGenerateSecret(ks).getEncoded();

The steps that was mentioned is as follows:

Use the FIN message input as a binary value (unsigned char in C language, byte in Java). The FIN message input must be coded in the ASCII character set.
Combine the left LAU key and the right LAU key as one string. The merged LAU key must be used as a binary value (unsigned char in C language, byte in Java). The merged LAU key must be coded in the ASCII character set.
Call a HMAC256 routine to compute the hash value. The hash value must also be treated as a binary value (unsigned char in C language, byte in Java). The hmac size is 32 bytes.
Convert the hmac binary values to uppercase hexadecimal printable characters (for example, a onebyte binary value of 0000 1010 has a hexadecimal value of 0x0A and will be translated to the twobyte characters “0A”).

Thanks!
","TL;TR: signature and thumbprint are totally different things. For strength of the certificate thumbprint is irrelevant but signature is relevant.
The signature of a certificate is the thing the issuer creates by signing the certificate. This signature is used by the TLS stack (inside the browser) to validate the trust chain. It is important to use a strong algorithm here so that nobody can create a fake certificate which looks like it was signed by a trusted issuer (CA). 
The thumbprint is just a hash over the certificate. It is mainly intended for human reception, i.e. check that the certificate is the intended one. This is usually used with self-signed certificates where the browser can not validate the certificate by itself since there is no trusted issuer and so the user should verify the certificate manually against the expected one. 
A certificate has only a single signature since it has only a single issuer. But you often find multiple thumbprints for the certificate, i.e. one with MD5, one with SHA-1 and one with SHA-256. This is because the browser does not know which one you got for manual verification and that's why it offers you the most common versions.

What will be the identification of my certicate SHA1/SHA2?

The identification is the certificate itself, i.e. neither the signature not the thumbprint. But if you mean the ""this certificate was signed with ...."" part than this is SHA-256 in your case since what counts is the signature and not some thumbprint.

I am writing my own, very small and simple class but cannot figure out why my signature fails validation here even though I've tried to stick to the standard.  I've been trying for hours and I'm stuck. Please help!
My code is simple
//build the headers
$headers = ['alg'=>'HS256','typ'=>'JWT'];
$headers_encoded = base64url_encode(json_encode($headers));

//build the payload
$payload = ['sub'=>'1234567890','name'=>'John Doe', 'admin'=>true];

//build and return the token
$token = ""$headers_encoded.$payload_encoded.$signature"";

The base64url_encode function:
function base64url_encode($data) {
    return rtrim(strtr(base64_encode($data), '+/', '-_'), '=');
}

My headers and payload perfectly match the validation site's default JWT, but my signature doesn't match so my token is flagged as invalid.  This standard seems really straightforward so what's wrong with my signature?
","I solved it!  I did not realize that the signature itself needs to be base64 encoded. In addition, I needed to set the last optional parameter of the hash_hmac function to $raw_output=true (see the docs.  In short I needed to change my code from the original:
//build the signature
$key = 'secret';
$signature = hash_hmac('SHA256',""$headers_encoded.$payload_encoded"",$key);

//build and return the token
$token = ""$headers_encoded.$payload_encoded.$signature"";

To the corrected:
//build the signature
$key = 'secret';
$signature = hash_hmac('SHA256',""$headers_encoded.$payload_encoded"",$key,true);
$signature_encoded = base64url_encode($signature);

//build and return the token

The openssl ""dgst"" module returns the same format as .hexdigest, and its ""passwd"" module doesn't include SHA512 support.
String#crypt, but that does not support SHA512. (edit: this is only the case on OSX - modern Linux distros will work if you specify ""$6$somesalt"" as the salt)
ruby-crypt gem, but it does not support SHA512

For comparison, something that does return the proper format is PHP's crypt, but I'd rather not have to exec out to PHP for something that should be simple.
","After further research:

The mkpasswd command, which on debian is in the whois package (weird):
mkpasswd -m sha-512
String#crypt does actually call the platform's native crypt() call, however OSX (up to 10.6) does not include support for alternate ciphers.  ""password"".crypt('$6$somesalt') will work on Linux platforms.

I first tried this:
>>> import base64

But it's to short, I need something longer, than I tried this:

'3d3cf25845f3aae505bafbc1c8f16d0bfdea7d70f6b141c21726da8d'

This is good, but now I don't know how to convert it back. If some one can help me eather with this example or suggest something else, how I can encode/decode a small string into a something longer, would be great.
UPDATE
based on plockc answer I did this, and it seems to work:
from Crypto.Cipher import AES # encryption library

BLOCK_SIZE = 32

# the character used for padding--with a block cipher such as AES, the value
# you encrypt must be a multiple of BLOCK_SIZE in length.  This character is
# used to ensure that your value is always a multiple of BLOCK_SIZE
PADDING = '{'

# one-liner to sufficiently pad the text to be encrypted
pad = lambda s: s + (BLOCK_SIZE - len(s) % BLOCK_SIZE) * PADDING

# one-liners to encrypt/encode and decrypt/decode a string
# encrypt with AES, encode with base64
EncodeAES = lambda c, s: base64.b64encode(c.encrypt(pad(s)))
DecodeAES = lambda c, e: c.decrypt(base64.b64decode(e)).rstrip(PADDING)

# create a cipher object using the random secret
cipher = AES.new('aaaaaaaaaa123456')

# encode a string
encoded = EncodeAES(cipher, 'ABC123')
print 'Encrypted string: %s' % encoded

# decode the encoded string
decoded = DecodeAES(cipher, encoded)
print 'Decrypted string: %s' % decoded

","You probably need to elaborate on how you are going to use it and why, as you have just opened Pandora's box :)
An encoding is reversible and should only be used to make data fit into something else (like base 64 binary data when you can only use text), a hash (like sha224) is not supposed to be reversible.
If you want to verify a user entering a password, you hash it (with like sha224) and store the hash, then when the user enters password again, you hash their entry and compare.  This is the simplified version, you also need to add ""salt"" to avoid a simple ""dictionary attack"".  I won't elaborate as that wasn't the question you asked.
To quickly answer your question you want an encryption library, like the cipher AES-128, which has a secret key and with the key you can recover the original data.  There will be some details in the library on how to create the key (it has to be a specific length and will be manipulated to make it that length).  If your key is based on simple passwords, go look at PBKDF2, which makes a strong encryption key from a weak password.
Don't confuse hmac as encryption (hmac uses another function, like the hashing function sha224), if the receiver of a messages shares a hmac key with the sender, they can ""authenticate"" that the message can from the sender, and it came without alteration.
Good luck!

","There is nothing insecure about using MD5 in this manner. MD5 was only broken in the sense that, there are algorithms that, given a bunch of data A additional data B can be generated to create a desired hash. Meaning, if someone knows the hash of a password, they could produce a string that will result with that hash. Though, these generated strings are usually very long so if you limit passwords to 20 or 30 characters you're still probably safe.
The main reason to use SHA1 over MD5 is that MD5 functions are being phased out. For example the Silverlight .Net library does not include the MD5 cryptography provider.

","Yes, it is worth worrying about in practice. MD5 is so badly broken that researchers have been able to forge fake certificates that matched a real certificate signed by a certificate authority. This meant that they were able to create their own fake certificate authority, and thus could impersonate any bank or business they felt like with browsers completely trusting them.
Now, this took them a lot of time and effort using a cluster of PlayStation 3s, and several weeks to find an appropriate collision. But once broken, a hash algorithm only gets worse, never better. If you care at all about security, it would be better to choose an unbroken hash algorithm, such as one of the SHA-2 family (SHA-1 has also been weakened, though not broken as badly as MD5 is).
edit: The technique used in the link that I provided you involved being able to choose two arbitrary message prefixes and a common suffix, from which it could generate for each prefix a block of data that could be inserted between that prefix and the common suffix, to produce a message with the same MD5 sum as the message constructed from the other prefix. I cannot think of a way in which this particular vulnerability could be exploited in the situation you describe, and in general, using a secure has for message authentication is more resistant to attack than using it for digital signatures, but I can think of a few vulnerabilities you need to watch out for, which are mostly independent of the hash you choose.

As described, your algorithm involves storing the password in plain text on the server. This means that you are vulnerable to any information disclosure attacks that may be able to discover passwords on the server. You may think that if an attacker can access your database then the game is up, but your users would probably prefer if even if your server is compromised, that their passwords not be. Because of the proliferation of passwords online, many users use the same or similar passwords across services. Furthermore, information disclosure attacks may be possible even in cases when code execution or privilege escalation attacks are not.
You can mitigate this attack by storing the password on your server hashed with a random salt; you store the pair <salt,hash(password+salt)> on the server, and send the salt to the client so that it can compute hash(password+salt) to use in place of the password in the protocol you mention. This does not protect you from the next attack, however.
If an attacker can sniff a message sent from the client, he can do an offline dictionary attack against the client's password. Most users have passwords with fairly low entropy, and a good dictionary of a few hundred thousand existing passwords plus some time randomly permuting them could make finding a password given the information an attacker has from sniffing a message pretty easy.
The technique you propose does not authenticate the server. I don't know if this is a web app that you are talking about, but if it is, then someone who can perform a DNS hijack attack, or DHCP hijacking on an unsecure wireless network, or anything of the sort, can just do a man-in-the-middle attack in which they collect passwords in clear text from your clients.
While the current attack against MD5 may not work against the protocol you describe, MD5 has been severely compromised, and a hash will only ever get weaker, never stronger. Do you want to bet that you will find out about new attacks that could be used against you and will have time to upgrade hash algorithms before your attackers have a chance to exploit it? It would probably be easier to start with something that is currently stronger than MD5, to reduce your chances of having to deal with MD5 being broken further.

Now, if you're just doing this to make sure no one forges a message from another user on a forum or something, then sure, it's unlikely that anyone will put the time and effort in to break the protocol that you described. If someone really wanted to impersonate someone else, they could probably just create a new user name that has a 0 in place of a O or something even more similar using Unicode, and not even bother with trying to forge message and break hash algorithms.
If this is being used for something where the security really matters, then don't invent your own authentication system. Just use TLS/SSL. One of the fundamental rules of cryptography is not to invent your own. And then even for the case of the forum where it probably doesn't matter all that much, won't it be easier to just use something that's proven off the shelf than rolling your own?

","Yes, someone can send a message and a correct hash without knowing the shared password.  They just need to find a string that hashes to the same value.
How common is that?

They then created twelve files, all identical except for the candidate's name and an arbitrary number of spaces following, that hashed to that value. The MD5 hash value is worthless as a checksum, because too many different files give the same result.
This is the same scenario as yours, if I'm reading you right. Just replace ""candidate's name"" with ""secret password"". If you really want to be secure, you should probably use a different hash function.

","In this particular case, I don't think that the weakest link your application is using md5 rather than sha. The manner in which md5 is ""broken"" is that given that md5(K) = V, it is possible to generate K' such that md5(K') = V, because the output-space is limited (not because there are any tricks to reduce the search space). However, K' is not necessarily K. This means that if you know md5(M+T+P) = V, you can generate P' such that md5(M+T+P') = V, this giving a valid entry. However, in this case the message still remains the same, and P hasn't been compromised. If the attacker tries to forge message M', with a T' timestamp, then it is highly unlikely that md5(M'+T'+P') = md5(M'+T'+P) unless P' = P. In which case, they would have brute-forced the password. If they have brute-forced the password, then that means that it doesn't matter if you used sha or md5, since checking if md5(M+T+P) = V is equivalent to checking if sha(M+T+P) = V. (except that sha might take constant time longer to calculate, that doesn't affect the complexity of the brute-force on P).
However, given the choice, you really ought to just go ahead and use sha. There is no sense in not using it, unless there is a serious drawback to using it.
A second thing is you probably shouldn't store the user's password in your database in plain-text. What you should store is a hash of the password, and then use that. In your example, the hash would be of: md5(message + time + md5(password)), and you could safely store md5(password) in your database. However, an attacker stealing your database (through something like SQL injection) would still be able to forge messages. I don't see any way around this.

On the server side, I'm checking this hash against the message that's sent using my knowledge of the time it was sent and the client's password.

In this example, am I really better off using SHA instead of MD5?
In what circumstances would the choice of hashing function really matter in a practical sense?
Edit:
Just to clarify - in my example, is there any benefit moving to an SHA algorithm?
In other words, is it feasible in this example for someone to send a message and a correct hash without knowing the shared password?

","if you are going to generate a hash-mac don't invent your scheme. use HMAC. there are issues with doing HASH(secret-key || message) and HASH(message || secret-key). if you are using a password as a key you should also be using a key derivation function. have a look at pbkdf2.

","Brian's answer covers the issues, but I do think it needs to be explained a little less verbosely
You are using the wrong crypto algorithm here 
MD5 is wrong here, Sha1 is wrong to use here Sha2xx is wrong to use and Skein is wrong to use. 
What you should be using is something like RSA.
Let me explain: 

Your secure hash is effectively sending the password out for the world to see. 

You mention that your hash is ""time + payload + password"", if a third party gets a copy of your payload and knows the time. It can find the password (using a brute force or dictionary attack). So, its almost as if you are sending the password in clear text. 
Instead of this you should look at a public key cryptography have your server send out public keys to your agents and have the agents encrypt the data with the public key. 
No man in the middle will be able to tell whats in the messages, and no one will be able to forge the messages.
On a side note, MD5 is plenty strong most of the time.

","I'm not going to comment on the MD5/SHA1/etc. issue, so perhaps you'll consider this answer moot, but something that amuses me very slightly is whenever the use of MD5 et al. for hashing passwords in databases comes up.
If someone's poking around in your database, then they might very well want to look at your password hashes, but it's just as likely they're going to want to steal personal information or any other data you may have lying around in other tables. Frankly, in that situation, you've got bigger fish to fry.
I'm not saying ignore the issue, and like I said, this doesn't really have much bearing on whether or not you should use MD5, SHA1 or whatever to hash your passwords, but I do get tickled slightly pink every time I read someone getting a bit too upset about plain text passwords in a database.

","Yes, it is worth to worry about which hash to use in this case. Let's look at the attack model first. An attacker might not only try to generate values md5(M+T+P), but might also try to find the password P. In particular, if the attacker can collect tupels of values Mi, Ti, and the corresponding md5(Mi, Ti, P) then he/she might try to find P. This problem hasn't been studied as extensively for hash functions as finding collisions. My approach to this problem would be to try the same types of attacks that are used against block ciphers: e.g. differential attacks. And since MD5 already highly susceptible to differential attacks, I can certainly imagine that such an attack could be successful here. 
Hence I do recommend that you use a stronger hash function than MD5 here. I also recommend that you use HMAC instead of just md5(M+T+P), because HMAC has been designed for the situation that you describe and has accordingly been analyzed.

","You should watch out for creating weaknesses when combining methods. (The java hash function and your own). I did a little research on cascaded ciphers, and this is an example of it. (the addition might interfere with the internals of hashCode().
The internals of hashCode() look like this:
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            h = 31*h + val[off++];
        }

so adding numbers together will cause the last characters of all strings in the array to just be added, which doesn't lower the randomness (this is already bad enough for a hash function).
If you want real pseudorandomness, take a look at the FNV hash algorithm. It is the fastest hash algorithm out there that is especially designed for use in HashMaps.
It goes like this:
    long hash = 0xCBF29CE484222325L;
    for(String s : strings)
    {
        hash ^= s.hashCode();
        hash *= 0x100000001B3L;
    }

^ This is not the actual implementation of FNV as it takes ints as input instead of bytes, but I think it works just as well.

","If the probability of false positives has to be zero, as opposed to ""lower than the probability you will be struck by lightning,"" then no hash algorithm at all can be used; you must compare the files byte by byte.
For what it's worth, if you can use third-party libraries, you can use Guava to compare two files byte-by-byte with the one-liner
Files.asByteSource(file1).contentEquals(Files.asByteSource(file2));

which takes care of opening and closing the files as well as the details of comparison.
If you're willing to accept false positives that are less likely than getting struck by lightning, then you could do
Files.hash(file, Hashing.sha1()); // or md5(), or sha256(), or...

which returns a HashCode, and then you can test that for equality with the hash of another file.  (That version also deals with the messiness of MessageDigest, of opening and closing the file properly, etcetera.)

As such, I need to construct a hash in Android, that given the same inputs in ASP.NET will generate an equivalent hash. I'm pulling my hair out trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong.
Here's the Android code:
public String computeHash(String input) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException{
    MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");
    digest.reset();
    try{
      digest.update(input.getBytes(""UTF-8""));

      sb.append(Integer.toString((byteData[i] & 0xff) + 0x100, 16).substring(1));
    }
    return sb.toString();
}

AND HERE's THE CODE ON THE SERVER (c#):
    private static string ComputeHash(string input, HashAlgorithm algorithm)
    {

        Byte[] inputBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(input);
        Byte[] hashedBytes = algorithm.ComputeHash(inputBytes);

            sb.Append(String.Format(""{0:x2}"", hashedBytes[i]));
        }

        return sb.ToString();
    }

UPDATE: 
Here is the corrected Android/Java implementation (thank you Nikolay Elenkov):
public String computeHash(String input) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, UnsupportedEncodingException{
    MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");
    digest.reset();

","Google developed and uses (I think) FarmHash for performance-critical hashing. From the project page:

FarmHash is a successor to CityHash, and includes many of the same tricks and techniques, several of them taken from Austin Appleby’s MurmurHash.
...
On CPUs with all the necessary machine instructions, about six different hash functions can contribute to FarmHash's lineup. In some cases we've made significant performance gains over CityHash by using newer instructions that are now commonly available. However, we've also squeezed out some more speed in other ways, so the vast majority of programs using CityHash should gain at least a bit when switching to FarmHash.

(CityHash was already a performance-optimized hash function family by Google.)
It was released a year ago, at which point it was almost certainly the state of the art, at least among the published algorithms. (Or else Google would have used something better.) There's a good chance it's still the best option.

Maybe a 128 bit hash is good enough for file deduplication? (vs 160 bit sha-1)
In my program the hash is calculated on chuncks from 0 - 512 KB.
","The facts: 

Good hash functions, specially the cryptographic ones (like SHA-1),
require considerable CPU time because they have to honor a number of
properties that wont be very useful for you in this case;
Any hash function will give you only one certainty: if the hash values of two files are different, the files are surely different. If, however, their hash values are equal, chances are that the files are also equal, but the only way to tell for sure if this ""equality"" is not just a hash collision, is to fall back to a binary comparison of the two files.

The conclusion:
In your case I would try a much faster algorithm like CRC32, that has pretty much all the properties you need, and would be capable of handling more than 99.9% of the cases and only resorting to a slower comparison method (like binary comparison) to rule out the false positives. Being a lot faster in the great majority of comparisons would probably compensate for not having an ""awesome"" uniformity (possibly generating a few more collisions).

","128 bits is indeed good enough to detect different files or chunks. The risk of collision is infinitesimal, at least as long as no intentional collision is being attempted.
64 bits can also prove good enough if the number of files or chunks you want to track remain ""small enough"" (i.e. no more than a few millions ones).

","Since the only relevant property of hash algorithms in your case is the collision probability, you should estimate it and choose the fastest algorithm which fulfills your requirements.
If we suppose your algorithm has absolute uniformity, the probability of a hash collision among n files using hashes with d possible values will be:

For example, if you need a collision probability lower than one in a million among one million of files, you will need to have more than 5*10^17 distinct hash values, which means your hashes need to have at least 59 bits. Let's round to 64 to account for possibly bad uniformity.
So I'd say any decent 64-bit hash should be sufficient for you. Longer hashes will further reduce collision probability, at a price of heavier computation and increased hash storage volume. Shorter caches like CRC32 will require you to write some explicit collision handling code.

What do I choose if I want a faster function and collision on random data near to SHA-1?
Maybe a 128 bit hash is good enough for file deduplication? (vs 160 bit sha-1)
In my program the hash is calculated on chuncks from 0 - 512 KB.
","Check out MurmurHash2_160. It's a modification of MurmurHash2 which produces 160-bit output. 
It computes 5 unique results of MurmurHash2 in parallel and mixes them thoroughly. The collision probability is equivalent to SHA-1 based on the digest size.
It's still fast, but MurmurHash3_128, SpookyHash128 and MetroHash128 are probably faster, albeit with a higher (but still very unlikely) collision probability. There's also CityHash256 which produces a 256-bit output which should be faster than SHA-1 as well.

","Plagiarism detection is a special case of similarity detection. This is a big field of study that's almost as old as computer science its self. There is a lot of published research, and there just isn't a single simple answer.
See, eg, a Google Scholar search for ""code similarity plagiarism"" or ""plagiarism detection"". Regular Google searches for things like ""source code similarity detection algorithm"" can also be useful.
There are plenty of existing tools in the space, too, so I'm surprised you're trying to write your own.
As you've noted, a check-sum won't do the job unless the code is perfectly identical. Techniques that can help include:

Building word-frequency histograms and comparing them
Extracting comment text and looking for copied comments using text-substring matching
Extracting variable, class and method names and looking for other code that uses the same names. You have to do a lot of correction for ""obvious"" names that everyone will choose, and for names that're dictated by the problem, like implementing a particular interface or API. Private class member variables and the local variables inside a function or method are the most useful to compare. You will need the help of a compiler or at least syntax parser for the language to extract these.
Looking for differences in indenting style. Did the user use all-spaces indenting, except for this one function that's indented with tabs?
Comparing parse trees or token streams to strip out the effects of formatting. You'd usually have to compare individual functions, etc, not just the code as a whole.
... and lots more

What you'll have to do is produce a report that weighs all these factors and others and presents them to a human so the human can make a decision. Your tool should explain why it thinks two results are similar, not just that they are similar.

","How i would aproach this, and custom enhancements can be added lately:
Remove everything that is not a letter or number;
Use explode() with empty space character as delimiter and find all the words; now you know how many words you have in that article;
Now, you must find out how many times a word apears in that article, and increase the word indicator each time that word is found in the text;
Store this into an array, like:
$words['wordX']++;

Do this also with the seccond article that you want to check with;
Now, compare them; You know the original data; some conclusions ca be made at this step;
Using the big characters, like J from John, F from Feudalism, you can also make some conclusions;
From here you may know if the article is about the same thing, and this could be the real step #1
Now, somehow you have to parse both articles, word by word, in the same time, and see the differecnce beetween them.
A student can add a own ""original"" sentence after each sentence/paragraph found in the original article.
Make sure that if you advance to much in the parsing process on one of the articles, you somehow keep a balanced parsing process and try to parse the seccond article until you reach that balance.
i see 2 for instructions, maybe 3, or instead of 3, a function that tryes to keep the balance in the parsing process.
Also, you have to use explode() and check sentence by sentence, and word by word from each sentence and find the similarity.
I am sure that you get the idea, but i say again, you cant parse the entire WWW.

","But is it worth it? If you have a hash for each file, then you essentially have an overhead for each file. Let's say that each file must take up at least 512 bytes (a typical disk sector) and that you're storing these hashes compactly enough so as to not have each hash take up much more than the hash size.
So, even if all your files are 512 bytes, the smallest, you're talking either 16 / 512 = 3.1% or 32 / 512 = 6.3%. In reality, I'd bet your average file size is higher (unless all your files are 1 sector...), so that overhead would be less.
Now, the amount of space you need for hashes scales linearly with the number of files you have. Is that extra space worth that much? Even if you had your mentioned trillion files - that's 1 000 000 000 000 * 16 = ~29 TiB, which is a lot of space, but keep in mind: your data would be 1 000 000 000 000 * 512 = 465 TiB. The numbers are worthless, really, since it's still 3% or 6% overhead. But at this level, where you have a half petabyte of storage, does 15 terabytes matter? At any level, does a 3% savings mean anything? And remember, if they're larger, you save less. (Which, they probably are: good luck getting a 512 byte sector size at that hard disk size.)
So, is this 3% or less disk savings worth the potential risk in security. (Which I'll leave unanswered, as it's waaay not my cup of tea.)
Alternatively, could you, say, group files together in some logical fashion, so that you have less files? (I mean, if you have trillions of 512 byte files, do you really want to hash every byte on disk?)

","SHA-1 is not an encryption algorithm, it's a hashing algorithm. By definition, you can't ""decrypt"" anything that was hashed with the SHA-1 function, it doesn't have an inverse.
If you have an arbitrary hashed password, there's very little you can do to retrieve the original password - If you're lucky, the password could be in a database of reverse hashes, but that's as far as you can go.
And the message extraction algorithm expects the original password to perform the verification - the algorithm will hash the provided plain-text password and compare it against the stored hashed password, only if they're equal the plain-text message will be revealed.

","Hashing functions are different than normal crypto algorithms. They are oftenly referred to as one-way ciphers, because the process data goes through is irreversible.
Differently than symmetric and assymetric encryption, hashes are used by asserting the hashed values themselves, instead of decrypting and asserting the plain-text values. To validate logins when you're using hashes, you'd hash the password the user just attempted to log in with and compare it with the hash you have on your DB. If they match, login is successful.
Cracking hashes involves guessing hashing various different strings and trying to match hashed values to the ones illegally obtained from a DB. There are lists available on the internet with millions of already hashed values to make hash cracking easier, those are known as Rainbow Tables and they can be easily countered with the use of Salts.
It's also worth noting that since hashing algorithms are able to digest GBs of data into significantly smaller strings, mathematically, two different values may have identical hashes. Even though this is very rare, it is an existing problem, and its known as Hash Collision.
Can you immagine if hashing was reversible? Hard drives would be reduntant since we would be able to hash thousands of GBs into a small string of text and reverse them as we pleased. It would be the nirvana of data compression and storage.

","Hash functions are one way tickets. You cannot use them for encryption.
Hash function algorithms are realised through modulo, xor and other familiar (one way) operations.
You may try to find what argument was used to generate hash but in theory you will never be 100% sure it is the correct value.
For example try with a really simple (useless in cryptography) hash function modulo 10. This function returns ten different values. If it's 7 you may guess the entry was 7 or 137 and 1234567. Same with md5, sha1 and better ones.
As you can see, in the case when you are using hash function that returns only 40 bytes with files that are much bigger (maybe even few hundred megabytes) there in theory exists infinite numbers of files for each possible hash.

How is it secure/unique? If I will use for example first 5 or 10 chars from MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256 is it enough secure?
Thank you.
","By default git only shows 7 characters as the odds are it will be unique, and you can refer to commits/blobs using just enough characters to define it as unique. 
However, under the hood it still using the full hash. If your git tree has two commits with the same first 7 numbers, then it will throw an error if you only use 7 characters to identify one of those commits.
If the user is entering the hash for data that the system already knows about, then allow the user to enter as many characters as he thinks he needs, and if that isn't enough to uniquely identify which hash he is talking about, then error and prompt for more.
7 hex characters gives ~ 2x10^7 possible hashes. Assuming you are using a good hash - i.e. it has an even spread across the values then by square approximation you have a 50% chance of a duplicate after ~19k* hashes. Whether this is acceptable to you depends on how many you are inserting
*The number of inserts to get a 50% chance of a hash collision for a hash of N hex characters is approximately 0.5+sqrt(0.25-(2xln(0.5)x16^N))

I will have about 50 000 000 records in database. Each must have own hash. I would like to have unique hashes. But if a little records have the same hash, I can accept. Unique is better.
MD2 is good secure for me, but hash is long: ""8350e5a3e24c153df2275c9f80692773"" - 32 chars. If you must write 10 MD2 hash on keybord you do not happy...

","Check out hashids, which is designed to generate unique YouTube-style hashes from your primary keys (or some other set of unique numbers). It's not really a hash in the sense that MD5 and SHA-1 are, as it's designed to be reversible.
As an example, if you want to ""hash"" your single integer primary key, you may get a relationship like
(PK: 1) <=> (hashid: 8dY0qQ)

This is seeded from a secret value that you control, so users are not able to determine the primary key they're really referencing. If your database is somewhat more involved, say with multiple shards and complex keys, you're still okay. hashids takes a list of integers as input:
(3, 171, 24) <=> (243j7Z)

As the developer, you are responsible for defining the hash's minimum length. As you generate more and more hashes, hashids may generate slightly longer hashes.
Hashes are guaranteed to be unique for a given input (initial seed, minimum hash length, and list of integers to hash):

There are no collisions. Your generated hashes should be unique. 

There is support for

JavaScript
Ruby
Python
Java
PHP
Perl
CoffeeScript
Objective-C
Go
Lua
Node.js
.NET

","The docs for updating a file specify that you will need to provide the SHA for the file you will be replacing. The easiest way would be to query github for that, too. For example:
> curl https://api.github.com/repos/testacc01/testrepo01/contents/test.txt
{
  ""name"": ""test.txt"",
  ""path"": ""test.txt"",
  ""sha"": ""4f8a0fd8ab3537b85a64dcffa1487f4196164d78"",
  ""size"": 13,
 …

So, you can see what the SHA is in the ""sha"" field of the JSON response. Use that when you formulate your request to update the file with a new version. After you have successfully updated the file, the file will have a new SHA that you will need to request before it can be updated again.

"11188749","Installed OpenSSL, no openssl.h file","I have found an answer to a question on this site, which I have tried to implement from here.
I downloaded and installed openssl from here. I performed each step mentioned within the install text inside the extracted file. 
$ ./config
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make install
These all finished without error. Then when I tried to compile the code on how to generate an SHA hash using the example code from the answered question, I am given the following error:
fatal error: openssl.h: No such file or directory
Do I have to do something more to create the openssl header file, as I thought after installing openssl without any problems it would be automatically created? This is the first time I am adding a library to C, so please excuse any naiveties on my part.
Thanks for reading. 
","Try including the -I option for compilation specifying the openssl directory when compiling your example program.
This is from the INSTALL file in the openssl directory:
  *  WRITING applications

     To write an application that is able to handle both the new
     and the old directory layout, so that it can still be compiled
     with library versions up to OpenSSL 0.9.2b without bothering
     the user, you can proceed as follows:

     -  Always use the new filename of OpenSSL header files,
        e.g. #include <openssl/ssl.h>.

     -  Create a directory ""incl"" that contains only a symbolic
        link named ""openssl"", which points to the ""include"" directory
        of OpenSSL.
        For example, your application's Makefile might contain the
        following rule, if OPENSSLDIR is a pathname (absolute or
        relative) of the directory where OpenSSL resides:

        incl/openssl:
                -mkdir incl
                cd $(OPENSSLDIR) # Check whether the directory really exists
                -ln -s `cd $(OPENSSLDIR); pwd`/include incl/openssl

        You will have to add ""incl/openssl"" to the dependencies
        of those C files that include some OpenSSL header file.

     -  Add ""-Iincl"" to your CFLAGS.

     With these additions, the OpenSSL header files will be available
     under both name variants if an old library version is used:
     Your application can reach them under names like <openssl/foo.h>,
     while the header files still are able to #include each other
     with names of the form <foo.h>.

I suggest you read the INSTALL file in the openssl source directory to get more details.

","Most modern cryptographic hash functions process messages in fixed-length blocks; all but the earliest hash functions include some sort of padding scheme. It is critical for cryptographic hash functions to employ termination schemes that prevent a hash from being vulnerable to length extension attacks. The rest can be found here wiki
And by explaining with my own words: if you want to encrypt a text, the algorithm splits in into blocks of same size, if you don't have enough data at the last block the algorith adds 0's until it has the same size as the others.

As a summary, a ""1"" followed by a number of ""0""s followed by a 64-bit or 128-bit integer are appended to the end of the message. 

0x80000000 is 10000000000000000000000000000000 in binary. Here is your ""1"" followed by a number of ""0""s.
The reason is that SHA-256 processes the input by splitting it in blocks of fixed size. The last block might be smaller, so it is extended (padded) until its size matches the expected block size.

","Basically hash algorithms need a specific block size (fixed multiple of bytes) to work with.  Adding ""padding"" to the end of a message makes it reach the next multiple of block bytes.  But, you also need to know how big the actual message is as well.  By adding a 1-bit followed by enough 0-bits to the message you can then read back from the end of the message until you hit the first 1-bit, and that is the end of your message, so you know the size of it.

","SHA-2 hashes are built upon the Merkle-Damgård scheme. This means that the hash function is based on a one-way compression function which takes n + r bits of input and outputs r bits. Thus, the input must be partitioned into n-bit blocks such that the compression function can be applied to the each block with the output of the last round.
The padding is necessary such that the input can be partitioned into n-bit blocks. In particular a Merkle-Damgård compliant padding is used for security reasons (see the link for details).

When a user logs in, I want to do a check on his password. If it's still in plain text, it should get converted to a secure form.
","I'm a bit confused by this question. 
When a user enters his or her password on your website, you can assume that the value in $_POST['password'] (or whatever you name it) is in plain text. Even if the user is using the result of a hash function as their password, that doesn't matter, since as far as your application is concerned, it's still plain text. That is, the hashed value is the users password, no matter the steps they took to create it, as the entry of that value into the system results in access for that user. The point of hashing user-submitted passwords on the server is so that even you don't know that users password. That way, if your database is compromised, the users password isn't revealed. 
Once you have the password, you retrieve that users salt and hashed password from the database. You take the submitted form, hash it with the user-specific salt, then compare it to the pre-hashed password from the database. If the hashed submission and the pre-hashed database values match, then you can assume the correct password was entered.
The only reason I can see for doing things as you describe, is if you had previously stored your passwords in plain text, and are now in the process of converting them all to hashes. In that case, you should simply assign each user a unique salt, hash their current plain-text password + salt, and store that as their new password. This conversion should occur all at once, when the ""hashwords"" are enabled, rather than doing it piecemeal as the users login for the first time post-transition.

The algorithm you described calculates something, but not sha256. 
Since you know the expected value you presumably have some reference implementation of your algorithm in another language so just do a line-by-line port to Go.
Finally, it's a dubious optimization in any case. 128 bits is 16 bytes. Hashing cost is usually proportional to the size of data. At 16 bytes, the cost is so small that the additional work of trying to be clever by splitting data in 8 byte parts will likely cost more than what you saved.

","In sha256.go, at the start of function Sum() the implementation is making a copy of the SHA256 state. The underlying datatype of SHA256 (struct digest) is private to the sha256 package.
I would suggest to make your own private copy of the sha256.go file (it is a small file). Then add a Copy() function to save the current state of the digest:
func (d *digest) Copy() hash.Hash {
    d_copy := *d
    return &d_copy

Then simply call the Copy() function to save a midstate SHA256 hash.

How do I calculate a midstate SHA-256 hash in Google Go?
","I ran two Go benchmarks on your 128 bytes of data, using an Intel i5 2.70 GHz CPU. First,  1,000 times, I wrote all 128 bytes to the SHA256 hash and read the sum, which took a total of about 9,285,000 nanoseconds. Second, I wrote the first 64 bytes to the SHA256 hash once and then, 1,000 times, I wrote the second 64 bytes to a copy of the SHA256 hash and read the sum, which took a total of about 6,492,371 nanoseconds. The second benchmark, which assumed the first 64 bytes are invariant, ran in 30% less time than the first benchmark.
Using the first method, you could calculate about 9,305,331,179 SHA256 128-byte sums per day before buying a faster CPU. Using the second method, you could calculate 13,307,927,103 SHA256 128-byte sums per day, assuming the first 64 bytes are invariant 1,000 times in a row, before buying a faster CPU. How many SHA256 128-byte sums per day do you need to calculate? For how many SHA256 128-byte sums per day are the first 64 bytes are invariant?

How do I calculate a midstate SHA-256 hash in Google Go?
","Bitcoin-related byte operations are a bit tricky, as they tend to switch endianness at a whim. First of, we take the initial []byte array representing
00000001c570c4764aadb3f09895619f549000b8b51a789e7f58ea750000709700000000103ca064f8c76c390683f8203043e91466a7fcc40e6ebc428fbcc2d89b574a864db8345b1b00b5ac00000000000000800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080020000

Then, we separate out the first half of the array, obtaining:
00000001c570c4764aadb3f09895619f549000b8b51a789e7f58ea750000709700000000103ca06 4f8c76c390683f8203043e91466a7fcc40e6ebc428fbcc2d8

After that, we need to swap some bytes around. We reverse the order of bytes in every slice of 4 bytes, thusly obtaining:
0100000076C470C5F0B3AD4A9F619598B80090549E781AB575EA587F977000000000000064A03C10396CC7F820F8830614E94330C4FCA76642BC6E0ED8C2BC8F

And that is the array we will be using for calculating the midstate. Now, we need to alter the file hash.go, adding to type Hash interface:
Midstate() []byte

And change the file sha256.go, adding this function:
func (d *digest) Midstate() []byte {
    var answer []byte
    for i:=0;i<len(d.h);i++{
        answer=append(answer[:], Uint322Hex(d.h[i])...)
    }
    return answer
}

Where Uint322Hex converts an uint32 variable into a []byte variable. Having all that, we can call:
var h BitSHA.Hash = BitSHA.New()
h.Write(Str2Hex(""0100000076C470C5F0B3AD4A9F619598B80090549E781AB575EA587F977000000000000064A03C10396CC7F820F8830614E94330C4FCA76642BC6E0ED8C2BC8F""))
log.Printf(""%X"", h.Midstate())

Where Str2Hex turns a string into []byte. The result is:
69FC72E76DB0E764615A858F483E3566E42D56B2BC7A03ADCE9492887010EDA8

Remembering the proper answer:
e772fc6964e7b06d8f855a6166353e48b2562de4ad037abc889294cea8ed1070

We can compare them:
69FC72E7 6DB0E764 615A858F 483E3566 E42D56B2 BC7A03AD CE949288 7010EDA8
e772fc69 64e7b06d 8f855a61 66353e48 b2562de4 ad037abc 889294ce a8ed1070

So we can see that we just need to swap the bytes around a bit in each slice of 4 bytes and we will have the proper ""midstate"" used by Bitcoin pools and miners (until it will no longer be needed due to being deprecated).

I would appreciate a simple answer not links as I never find them useful.
","With nowadays technology, both can be cracked. There are also hash dictionaries that help find what a hash means for short strings.
If they are secure or not, highly depends on what you want to protect. If you are building an online banking system, they are not recommended at all (depending where in the online banking system they come to use). If you implement them just for online user password hashing, for example, it also depends on: is you website worth cracking, how many users you have, etc.
A general advice, is to first study the level of security you want to achieve in you scenario and decide what technologies (in this case hashing) you use. There is also no 100% security. Also don't invest too much time into one security issues and ignore others which might not be as obvious or technical (human errors, security by obscurity, human engineering).
Check this out:

generate the hash for a small word here. For example, password has the MD5 hash: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
now go here and ask back for the text.

The above example is just one of many (dictionary attack) possible way to crack them. Also the wikipedia articles of each security algorithms gives you a list of vulnerabilities.
ALSO SEE:

Is MD5 less secure than SHA et. al. in a practical sense?

SIDE NOTE
Never let websites generate a hash for a real password that you have (in case you need it somewhere for testing or other reasons). Always use test passwords, or generate hashes on your local machine. People building hash databases (hackers or not), also provide online hash tools for capturing hashes.

","When discussing hash security vs brute force shouldn't we take some more in account?
First of all, is md5 obfuscated data stored in trusted zone or not. In other words, do we trust our db admin not to try read user passwords from the database and brute force reverse them. This can be trusted or technically granted via some security procedures (db admin may not have access to the table that stores password hashes, this may be accessible for security officer only).
Another one is possibility of login+password hash pair hijacking from client or client-server transaction. If there's no trojan horse in the client and the communication between client and server is TLS-secured, the pair should be secure from man-in-the-middle attacks. 
What is left for the attacker is (apart from social engineering, xss and hosting security break) to subsequently send number of generated requests to the logon server and see if one is successful. This can be managed too:

after both successful and unsuccessful login there may be some random
lag time before the service responds to slow down brute force process
login process may queue parallel login requests from same IP and parallel logins with same login name (to enforce the rule above)
there may be limit implemented for unsuccessful logins, after it is exceeded the account is locked and security alert is launched

I believe when above rules are implemented the md5 hash is secure enough. In fact it is equally secure as plain password :) To sum it up if we believe our md5 hash is secure we may simply leave passwords uncovered. The twist is nowadays there is no use of md5 at all (in the matter of password obfuscating). What one should do is leave it plain in the storage in the trusted zone or use some stronger tool (like SHA) when trusted zone is not to be managed. And in my opinion the trusted zone is still under risk of server (hosting service) security break, so no matter of all simply obfuscate the passwords with SHA (or better) :) This shouldn't be costly to harden password hashing itself and it brings some benefits (reduces risks) so my advice is never to revisit this discussion again.
Still even with SHA hashing all the spoken security rules should be implemented. Especially TLS which prevents compromising login+password pair (no matter password is sent plain or hashed with md5 or sha it may enable successful login). Also login attempts should be monitored. Even if we believe our site is brute-force-proof it is good to know someone is trying to break security.

","Yes, you are describing a hashing algorithm.  You could use a MD5 or SHA1 digest (since they just produce random bits) to generate a floating point number simply by using the String#unpack method with an argument of ""G"" (double-precision float, network byte order) from a digest:
require 'digest/sha1'

def string_to_float(str)
  Digest::SHA1.digest(str).unpack(""G"")[0]
end

string_to_float(""abc-123"") # => -2.86011943713676e-154

string_to_float(""def-456"") # => -1.13232994606094e+214 OK!

Note that if you want the resulting floats to be in a particular range then you'll need to do some massaging.
Also note that the unpacked number doesn't use all of the bits from the digest so you might want to combine into the number of bytes for a double floating point number (although you'll have to be careful not to decrease the entropy of the hash function, if you care about that sort of thing), e.g.:
def str2float(s)
  d = Digest::SHA1.digest(s)
  x, y = d[0..9], d[10..19]
   # XOR the 1st (x) and 2nd (y) halves to use all bits.

","If security is no issue, what you are describing is in my opinion not a hash function. A hash function is a one-way function, meaning computing the hash is easy but reverting it is ""hard"" or, ideally, impossible.
Your requirements instead describe an injective function Given any x1, x2 in your domain X the following holds:
For all x1, x2 element of X, x1 != x2  => f(x1) != f(x2)

f(x) = x is such a function, f(x) = x² is not. In plain English: you want to have different results if your inputs are different, same results only if the inputs are the same. It is true that this also is true for secure hashes, but they additionally provide the one-way characteristics such as the property of not being able (easily) to find x if you are only given f(x), among others. As far as I understood, you don't need these security properties.
Trivially, such an injective mapping from String to Float would be given by simply interpreting the ""String bytes"" as ""Float bytes"" from now on, i.e. you interpret the bytes differently (think C:
unsigned char *bytes = ""..."";
double d = (double)bytes; 

). But, there is as downside to this - the real trouble is that Float has a maximum precision, so you will run into an overflow situation if your strings are too long (Floats are internally represented as double values, that's 8 bytes on a 32 bit machine). So not enough space for almost any use case. Even MD5-ing your strings first doesn't solve the problem - MD5 output is already 16 bytes long.
So this could be a real problem, depending on your exact requirements. Although MD5 (or any other hash) will mess sufficiently with the input to make it as random as possible, you still cut the range of possible values from 16 bytes to effectively 8 bytes. (Note: Truncating random 16 byte output at 8 bytes is generally considered ""secure"" in terms of preserving the randomness. Elliptic Curve Cryptography does something similar. But as far as I know, nobody can really prove it, but neither could someone prove the contrary so far). So a collision is much more likely with your restricted Float range. By the birthday paradox, finding a collision takes sqrt(number of values in a finite range) tries. For MD5 this is 2^64, but for your scheme it's only 2^32. That's still very, very unlikely to produce a collision. It's probably something in the order of winning the lottery while at the same time being hit by a lightning. If you could live with this minimal possibility, go for it:
def string_to_float(str)
  Digest::MD5.new.digest(str).unpack('D')

If uniqueness is of absolute priority I would recommend to move from floats to integers. Ruby has built-in support for large integers that are not restricted by the internal constraints of a long value (that's what a Fixnum boils down to). So any arbitrary hash output could be represented as a large integer number.

","You can find the documentation of OAuth 1.0 here, more precisely for your problem (sub)chapters  

9.2. HMAC-SHA1
Appendix A.5.1. Generating Signature Base String 
Appendix A.5.2. Calculating Signature Value  

According to documentation the Signature Base String is formed as:
HTTP_METHOD&urlencode(BASE_URL_OF_RESOURCE)&urlencode(PARAMETERS_ORDERED_AND_NORMALIZED_AND_WITHOUT_OAUTHSIGNATURE) 
The key used for hasing is:
urlencode(CONSUMER_SECRET)&urlencode(OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET)  - when you have a token secret
urlencode(CONSUMER_SECRET)&  - when you don't have a token secret (on the very beginning when requesting a ""Request Token"")
The final signature should be base64_encode(hash_hmac('SHA1', $signatureBaseString, $key, 1));
I put an example script so you can use/test/see how it works:
    <?php
// testMagentoRestApi.php file
error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', 'On');

Also you can do some reverse engineering in magento. For example when requesting an ""Request Token"" the flow is:  
Mage_Oauth_InitiateController::indexAction()
Mage_Oauth_Model_Server::initiateToken()
Mage_Oauth_Model_Server::_processRequest()
Mage_Oauth_Model_Server::_validateSignature()
Zend_Oauth_Http_Utility::sign()
Zend_Oauth_Signature_Hmac::sign()
Zend_Oauth_Signature_SignatureAbstract::_getBaseSignatureString()

Around the last 3 classes all the magic happens. You can check them out.

","On top of my head I do not know any fast C++ library. Computing a hash is relative straightforward, so any C library will be as easy to use (you can easily wrap it in a C++ class yourself). I found the following site where a guy implemented several hashing algorithms in x86 assembly and compared them to ""official"" C implementations of the same algorithms:
https://www.nayuki.io/page/fast-sha1-hash-implementation-in-x86-assembly
https://www.nayuki.io/page/fast-md5-hash-implementation-in-x86-assembly
Those implementations should be a good starting point and then you just have to make the file I/O as efficient as possible. Memory-mapped I/O is usually very efficient, or then you could go complex and use two threads: one thread reads chunks from the file and the other thread hashes the read data. The idea here would be to always keep the process doing something useful, i.e. hashes can be calculated while waiting for more data to be read from the file.

Could anyone help to recommend some efficient C++ library?
BTW, 
When reading file, fread( buffer, sizeof(char), BUFFER_SIZE, fin ), what size of BUFFER_SIZE is reasonable?
","I personally would do FILE *pipe = popen(""md5sum filename""); [or something to that effect] - it is likely to be as fast as anything else, since 1GB of a file will take a little while to read, and the calculation is unlikely to be using much of your CPU time - most of the time will be waiting for the disk to load up the file. 
On my system, I created 6 files of 1GB each, and it takes 2 seconds to checksum the file with md5sum. (12 seconds for all 6 files).

","The reason is probably that you did not specify the encoding to use when converting the string to bytes, java uses the platform default encoding, while UnicodeEncoding seems to use utf-16.
Edit:
The documentation for UnicodeEncoding says

This constructor creates an instance that uses the little endian byte order, provides a Unicode byte order mark, and does not throw an exception when an invalid encoding is detected.

Javas ""utf-16"" however seems to default to big endian byte order. With character encodings its better to be really specific, there is an UnicodeEncoding constructor taking two boolean specifiyng byte order, while in java there is also ""utf-16le"" and ""utf-16be"". You could try the following in c#
new UnicodeEncoding(true, false) // big endian, no byte order mark

and in java
myyString.getBytes(""utf-16be"")

Or even better use ""utf-8"" / Encoding.UTF8 in both cases since it is not affected by different byteorders.

Fix it accordingly:

It should at least be the same charset as UnicodeEncoding is internally using.

","The UnicodeEncoding in C# you use corresponds to the little-endian UTF-16 encoding, while ""UTF-16"" in Java corresponds to the big-endian UTF-16 encoding. Another difference is that C# doesn't output the Byte Order Marker (called ""preamble"" in the API) if you don't ask for it, while ""UTF-16"" in Java generates it always. To make the two programs compatible you can make Java also use the little-endian UTF-16:

Take 512bits of ""pepper"" from /dev/urandom which is stored in the file system. This is a

The hash and salt are stored in binary in the DB, mainly out of habit. I don't think it makes any difference in terms of security. If anything it's slightly less convenient for SQL backups and makes the PHP code appear marginally more complex.
Is hash() with SHA-256 or SHA-512 generally considered to have been superceeded by bcrypt these days?
I believe SHA-2 (256/512) is still considered cryptographically secure and I'm probably overdoing the entropy bits. It's far more likely that it would be a flaw in my code that would lead to problems than an attacker reverse-engineering a SHA-2 hash from a DB dump.
But should I update my methodology going forward to use crypt() with CRYPT_BLOWFISH instead (I believe this is referred to as bcrypt, with blowfish technically being a cipher rather than hashing algorithm)?
Even just as future best practice?
I'm not particularly concerned about the computational expense of the algorithms (within reason). This would only ever be a factor when creating accounts, changing passwords or on login when you hash then compare. Those activities make up a small percentage of page views. I guess in a way the slower the better, if it makes a server work harder to generate then it will make an attacker's work slower to brute force.

","You are definitely on the right track, bcrypt is a very nice way to store your passwords (scrypt is better but hard to find a good implementation in PHP).
Remember that sha1, sha256, sha512 were never made to hash passwords. They were designed to be fast, so that you could take large data sets and create a unique signature for them, in the shortest amount of time. They are used for signing more than anything else.
You definitely want to use a hashing algorithm that takes more time.
Side note: Some would argue that the pepper is pointless, since if they hack your system, they will have access to your salts and pepper.

signing function:
import { createHmac } from 'crypto';

const BASE64_REPLACE = { '+': '-', '/': '_', '=': '' };

export function signCdnUrl(fileName, opts) {
  // URL to sign
  const urlToSign = `${opts.baseUrl}/${fileName}?Expires=${opts.expires}&KeyName=${opts.keyName}`;

  // Compute signature
  const keyBuffer = Buffer.from(opts.keyBase64, 'base64');
  let signature = createHmac('sha1', keyBuffer).update(urlToSign).digest('base64');
  signature = signature.replace(/[+/=]/g, c => (<any>BASE64_REPLACE)[c]); // might be a better way

  // Add signature to urlToSign and return signedUrl
  return urlToSign + `&Signature=${signature}`;
}

Hope this helps. Somehow google cloud doc does not have a nodejs example and the file.getSignedUrl() add confusion to the mix as it does not seem to be related to CDN URL signing.

","The only way to check if a hash is a valid SHA-256 hash is to check 256 bits in it- if it does, then yes some input CAN possibly generate that output.

","I do not understand what you mean when you say: ""even if it was salted"". Salting happens before hashing, it offers some protection against rainbow table attacks and users using the same password on multiple sites. Depending on the base a simple regex can tell you if a particular string is a sha256 hash. i think most times we encounter hashes in base16, in that case this would work:
   if (preg_match(""/^([a-f0-9]{64})$/"", $hash) == 1) {

While 
 ivAMgsKo*H

and your code
new String(digest, ""UTF-8"")

tells me, that your digest is not encoded but stored as a UTF-8 string.
A hash value can contain not printable byte values, so it is common to encode the value. For example with Base64.

The private key is a .p12 file containing 1660 bytes of binary data.
Do I use the RSA_sign() API for this?  If so am I supposed to hash the data first?  Using what
key value?  I assume the RSA * parameter is supposed to hold the private key?  How does it get
loaded?  I have used the HMAC function to generate a SHA hash, but I'm a bit lost here - any help
or sample code would be appreciated.  (And yes, I know Google has libraries to do this, but none
for C, which I need to use).
","You can use RSA_sign to sign the data with SHA256 hash. You can call this
RSA_sign(NID_sha256, digest, digest_len, &sign_buffer, sign_len, rsa_key);

You have calculate SHA256 hash of the data into digest buffer. rsa_key should be initialized.
Since, you have .p12 file, you need to do the following.
Create PKCS12 structure from .p12 file.
PKCS12 * p12 = d2i_PKCS12_fp(fp_to_p12_file, NULL);

Parse the p12 structure to certificate and key.
PKCS12_parse(p12, passphrase, &evp_pkey, &x509_cert, NULL);

It will give EVP_PKEY structure from which you can get RSA structure using EVP_PKEY_get1_RSA or access evp_pkey->pkey.rsa member of the structure.
This should help you to start.

"11845157","How to create serials key to protect an application","I have an application that creates a serial key as follows:
Take customername
Sign customername using privatekey and sha/dsa algorithm

Then license can be checked by decoding with public key, and checking cuastomername matches
This works okay except that the generated serial is rather long. So it is not really practical for customer to type in the serial key instead they have to provide a serial with in a file, which is rather different to how mist applications and work and is confusing.
Many other applications just provide the user with a Guid when they make a purchase
i.e 5bd1060b-8608-4817-93ca-207f7c828e2f
and the user has to enter their email address and guid to license their application.
This looks like a neater solution for the user but I don't understand how such an application verifies a valid guid from an invalid guid unless its done all online by checking emailaddress/guid pairs on a database. But I really would like some kind of verification to be done without requiring an online check otherwise: 
a>The application will not work if internet connection/my server down
or
b>they can circumvent check by disabling internet access 
EDIT:
My understanding solution as proposed by answer below:
User makes purchase
Take emailaddress + salt
Encrypt with SHA1 gives 160bit hash
Convert to hex notation gives 20 hex values, i.e 40 characters
Lop of last 8 characters to give a Guid
Email User Gui and Email address which they enter into program 
Program verifies this pairing by taking the email address, adding salt, encrypting ectera
and checking generates a valid guid.   
My main problem with this is that I need to store the salt in the program somewhere, therefore if the hacker finds the salt and works out what Im doing they can create a valid license key generator for any email address.  
My current method for another program:
I have generated a public key/private key pair
User makes purchase
I generate a license by signing the emailaddress
BaseEncode the generated license
Send license to user
Program verifies license by basedecoding and decrypting with public key   
My problem has been that when I sign the emailaddress is too long so I end up putting it in a file instead of the user entering it into a field, but maybe the problem is that I am base64encoding rather than converting to Hex.
How long can the output of signing be, does it depend on the length of the input or is it always the same ?
Because I decrypt the key with the public key I canot lop some chars of the license key, but if the generate key is only 40 characters I guess that is okay
I think the advantage of this method is that even if hacker works out how I'm doing things, they cannot create a license generator because they do not, and cannot get the private key because it is only stored on my server. They could only generate licenses if they created a new private/public key pairing and then if my application had the public key encoded in itself  the application could reject the license anyway.

","You may just hash the user info concatenated with a ""secret"" salt and then truncate the hash.
Hackers - provided they are interested in your program - will crack it, by reverse engineering the source: they'll find both the hash algorithm and the secret salt.
But this is to happen also with your sign&verify solution: they can just bypass the check making it return true.
So the sign&verify solution is more complex but not safer.

"11845157","How to create serials key to protect an application","I have an application that creates a serial key as follows:
Take customername
Sign customername using privatekey and sha/dsa algorithm

Then license can be checked by decoding with public key, and checking cuastomername matches
This works okay except that the generated serial is rather long. So it is not really practical for customer to type in the serial key instead they have to provide a serial with in a file, which is rather different to how mist applications and work and is confusing.
Many other applications just provide the user with a Guid when they make a purchase
i.e 5bd1060b-8608-4817-93ca-207f7c828e2f
and the user has to enter their email address and guid to license their application.
This looks like a neater solution for the user but I don't understand how such an application verifies a valid guid from an invalid guid unless its done all online by checking emailaddress/guid pairs on a database. But I really would like some kind of verification to be done without requiring an online check otherwise: 
a>The application will not work if internet connection/my server down
or
b>they can circumvent check by disabling internet access 
EDIT:
My understanding solution as proposed by answer below:
User makes purchase
Take emailaddress + salt
Encrypt with SHA1 gives 160bit hash
Convert to hex notation gives 20 hex values, i.e 40 characters
Lop of last 8 characters to give a Guid
Email User Gui and Email address which they enter into program 
Program verifies this pairing by taking the email address, adding salt, encrypting ectera
and checking generates a valid guid.   
My main problem with this is that I need to store the salt in the program somewhere, therefore if the hacker finds the salt and works out what Im doing they can create a valid license key generator for any email address.  
My current method for another program:
I have generated a public key/private key pair
User makes purchase
I generate a license by signing the emailaddress
BaseEncode the generated license
Send license to user
Program verifies license by basedecoding and decrypting with public key   
My problem has been that when I sign the emailaddress is too long so I end up putting it in a file instead of the user entering it into a field, but maybe the problem is that I am base64encoding rather than converting to Hex.
How long can the output of signing be, does it depend on the length of the input or is it always the same ?
Because I decrypt the key with the public key I canot lop some chars of the license key, but if the generate key is only 40 characters I guess that is okay
I think the advantage of this method is that even if hacker works out how I'm doing things, they cannot create a license generator because they do not, and cannot get the private key because it is only stored on my server. They could only generate licenses if they created a new private/public key pairing and then if my application had the public key encoded in itself  the application could reject the license anyway.
Of course they could hack the application, but if the application was updated regularly this would become alot of effort.
So in summary:
Have I understood this correctly, which method is best, and how much data is generated for second approach.
","I think the signature approach is currently best practice. Btw. there are a number of free libs that cover this topic.
The length of the license key is at least determined by the signature key length - a 1024 bit key produces a 128 byte license (if no other payload is added). 
Often the license file consists of more information on the licensed use itself, like validity period, licensed submodules, throughput... - the signature itself is embedded within this structure. This way you gain flexibility and i strongly advise this solution, even if the license gets even bigger.
For importing the license in an application you can adopt a hybrid way (like we did). On one hand you can provide the classic ""import license file"" solution. On the other, we generate a random, short ID (like your GUID) and associate it with the license data. Upon registration the user enters the the short ID and the application looks up the complete license via HTTP. You must be online only once, you can still provide complex licenses and the user only needs a short ID.
EDIT

The length of s signature is the length of the key. E.g. 1024 bit (or 128 byte)
You can use this signature alone if your application knows what data is signed (e.g. the mail)
You can sign a ""license document"" containing more properties than only the mail. In this case the license contains  property AND signature (and is, accordingly, longer than only the signature)
You dont need online connection for license check. Just import a license with the application and check whenever you like.
An addition to license file import you CAN adopt an online download of the license file using a short ID as a key. The license is downloaded and offline. So you have the best of both worlds.

Is there a way to generate it directly in SQL Server?
Duplicate disclamer:
My question is not duplicate of SHA256 in T-sql stored procedure as I am looking for the SHA256 base 64 version of the algorithm which is not listed in the page.
Numeric Example
I have this query result in SQL Server

Start date,End date,POD,Amount,Currency 
2016-01-01,2016-12-31,1234567890,12000,EUR

this give me the following string (using concatenate function) 

2016-01-012016-12-31123456789012000EUR

whit this convertion tool I get the following hash 

GMRzFNmm90KLVtO1kwTf7EcSeImq+96QTHgnWFFmZ0U

that I need to send to a customer.
","First, the generator link you provided outputs the base64 representation in not exactly correct format. Namely, it omits the padding sequence. Though theoretically optional, padding is mandatory in MS SQL Server (tested on 2012 and 2016 versions).
With this in mind, the following code gives you what you need:
declare @s varchar(max), @hb varbinary(128), @h64 varchar(128);

select @s = '2016-01-012016-12-31123456789012000EUR';

set @hb = hashbytes('sha2_256', @s);
set @h64 = cast(N'' as xml).value('xs:base64Binary(sql:variable(""@hb""))', 'varchar(128)');

select @hb as [BinaryHash], @h64 as [64Hash];

Apart from the aforementioned padding, there is another caveat for you to look for. Make sure that the input string is always of the same type, that is, either always varchar or always nvarchar. If some of your hashes will be calculated from ASCII strings and some from UTF-16, results will be completely different. Depending on which languages are used in your system, it might make sense to always convert the plain text to nvarchar before hashing.

","The difference is because of the character encodings (ASCII vs UTF-8 in your examples). Note that the hashing algorithm takes an array of bytes, and you do the conversion from a string to that byte-array beforehand. 
Your question ""whats the standard code"" probably hasnt an answer, id say that if you expect the input to contain content from just the ASCII character-space, go for that, if not go for UTF-8. Either way - communicate it to your users
If you want to look at it from a usability perspective and make it the optimal for your users - go for both. Hash the content both ways and check agains the users incoming hash, but it all depends on your evaluation on clock-cycles vs security vs usability (you can have two)

","They are almost equivalent.
The difference is how the encoding for the string is established.
In the first portion of code it assumes ASCII, whereas in the second portion it assumes UTF-8. It is possible that the string used another encoding which is none of those.
But regardless of that, the idea is to understand what is the goal of this operation. The truly relevant things in this context are:

Given equal input, output should be the same
There should be no way to retrieve the plaintext only by knowing the output (within a reasonable amount of time)
After hashing, you no longer require the original input in plaintext.

A secure cryptographic hashing function (meaning not older functions like MD5) achieves that.
Then, if your data store where hashes are stored is compromised, the attacker would only have a hash which cannot be used to retrieved the original plaintext. This is why hashing is used rather than encryption, encryption is a reversible operation (through decryption).
Then, within the system, if you've made the decision to use one encoding, you need to keep that decision consistent across all components in your system so they can interoperate.

Have Keccak (SHA-3) example hashes (test vectors) been made available?

Yes. The NIST test vectors can be found at SHA-3 Reference and Optimized Implementations. The page includes:

Description of Known Answer Test (KAT) and Monte Carlo Test (MCT) for SHA-3 Candidate Algorithm Submissions
Test files and Source Code for Conducting KAT and MCT

These tests may be different from the Keccak test vectors because NIST modified some things. So, for SHA-3, I would specifically use what NIST provides.

","Question was edited while I was responding, following is ADDITIONAL code and should work (with my hex conversion code):

//NOT tested, but should be functional
public static String encodeURL(String hexString) throws Exception {
  if(hexString==null || hexString.isEmpty()){

  if(hexString.length()%2 != 0){
    throw new Exception(""String is not hex, length NOT divisible by 2: ""+hexString);

You'll need to convert the raw bytes to hexadecimal characters or whatever URL-friendly encoding they are using.  Base32 or Base64 encodings are possible, but straight hexadecimal characters is the most common.  URLEncoder is not needed for this string, because it shouldn't contain any characters that would require URL Encoding to %NN format.
The below will convert bytes for a hash (SHA-1, MD5SUM, etc) to a hexadecimal string:
/** Lookup table: character for a half-byte */
    static final char[] CHAR_FOR_BYTE = {'0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','A','B','C','D','E','F'};
         /** Encode byte data as a hex string... hex chars are UPPERCASE*/
         public static String encode(byte[] data){
             if(data == null || data.length==0){
                 return """";
             }
             char[] store = new char[data.length*2];
             for(int i=0; i<data.length; i++){
                 final int val = (data[i]&0xFF);
                 final int charLoc=i<<1;
                 store[charLoc]=CHAR_FOR_BYTE[val>>>4];
                 store[charLoc+1]=CHAR_FOR_BYTE[val&0x0F];
             }
             return new String(store);
         }

This code is fairly optimized and fast, and I am using it for my own SHA-1 byte encoding.  Note that you may need to convert uppercase to lowercase with the String.toLowerCase() method, depending on which form the server accepts.

","rec = raw_input() doesn't have a newline in it.
On the other hand, each line iterated upon by for w in wordk: has a trailing newline.
So you have to rstrip(""\n"") your lines or use splitlines() to get rid of the last newline character before performing the hash.

Edit: put all code in block instead of just a part of it.
","The bottleneck is that the whole file must be streamed/copied over the network, and your seems to look good...
the different hash functions (md5/sha256/sha512) have almost the same computation time  
Two possible solutions for this problem:
1) run a hasher on the remote system and store the hashes in to separate files - if that is possible in your environment.
2) Create a part-wise hash of the file, so that you only copy a part of the file.
I mean something like that:
part1Hash = md5(file.getXXXBytesFromFileAtPosition1)
part2Hash = md5(file.getXXXBytesFromFileAtPosition2)
part3Hash = md5(file.getXXXBytesFromFileAtPosition3)
finalHash = part1Hash ^ part2Hash ^ part3Hash;

you have to test which part of the file are optimal to read, so the hashes stay unique.
hope that helps...

","Since my question was getting more views than I expected, I decided to answer it to help others with the same problem. I found the equivalent for it in PHP.

"26592596","Why does SHA1.ComputeHash fail under high load with many threads?","I'm seeing an issue with some code I maintain. The code below has a private static SHA1 member (which is an IDisposable but since it's static, it should never get finalized). However, under stress this code throws an exception that suggests it has been closed:
Caught exception.  Safe handle has been closed"" 
Stack trace: Call stack where exception was thrown
at System.Runtime.InteropServices.SafeHandle.DangerousAddRef(Boolean& success)
at System.Security.Cryptography.Utils.HashData(SafeHashHandle hHash, Byte[] data, Int32 cbData, Int32 ibStart, Int32 cbSize)
at System.Security.Cryptography.Utils.HashData(SafeHashHandle hHash, Byte[] data, Int32 ibStart, Int32 cbSize)
at System.Security.Cryptography.HashAlgorithm.ComputeHash(Byte[] buffer)

The code in question is:
internal class TokenCache
{
    private static SHA1 _sha1 = SHA1.Create();

    private string ComputeHash(string password)
    {
        byte[] passwordBytes = UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(password);
        return UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetString(_sha1.ComputeHash(passwordBytes));
    }

My question is obviously what could cause this issue. Can the call to SHA1.Create fail silently (how many cryptographic resources are available)? Could this be caused by the appdomain going down?
Any other theories?
","As per the documentation for the HashAlgorithm base class

Any public static (Shared in Visual Basic) members of this type are thread safe. Any instance members are not guaranteed to be thread safe.

You should not share these classes between threads where different threads try and call ComputeHash on the same instance at the same time.
EDIT
This is what is causing your error. The stress test below yields a variety of errors due to multiple threads calling ComputeHash on the same hash algorithm instance. Your error is one of them.
Specifically, I have seen the following errors with this stress test:

System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException: Hash not valid for use in specified state.
System.ObjectDisposedException: Safe handle has been closed

Given that dyld's error when trying to run my app under Yosemite always refers to one of the libraries that only has a sha256 hash, my working theory is that OS/X 10.10.x's dyld is ancient enough that it doesn't know about SHA-256 hashes, and that is why it is erroring out when it tries to load a captive shared library that is signed only with an SHA-256 hash.
My question (assuming I'm not completely barking up the wrong tree here) is:  how does codesign decide when to stamp a file with sha256 hash alone, vs adding both an sha1 and an sha256 hash?  And how can I force codesign to always include both hashes, so that my app can launch under 10.10.x again (like it used to before we upgraded our build machine to OSX/Sierra)?
For the record, here is how I'm invoking codesign in my build script -- the invocation arguments are exactly the same for all libraries (both the Qt framework libraries that end up with sha1,sha256 and the non-Qt libraries that end up with only sha256), e.g.:
codesign -f -v -s ""Developer ID Application:  MyCompanyName"" ""./Frameworks/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib""
codesign -f -v -s ""Developer ID Application:  MyCompanyName"" ""./Frameworks/QtCore.framework/Versions/5/QtCore""

","After a lot of googling around, this answer and this answer led me to the solution.
The problem was that several of the third-party shared libraries included inside my app were being compiled using just their default build settings (e.g. ""./configure; make""), and since they were being compiled under OS/X 10.12, naturally they were compiled with only 10.12-compatibility in mind.
In order to get them to compile in such a way that the resulting .dylib files would be appropriate for earlier OS/X versions as well, I added these lines to the top of my build script:
export  LDFLAGS=""-mmacosx-version-min=10.9""   
export   CFLAGS=""-mmacosx-version-min=10.9""   
export CXXFLAGS=""-mmacosx-version-min=10.9""

... and that did the trick for all of the libraries (libssh2, libsndfile, libogg, libflac, libvorbis, etc) except for the libssl -- for that one I had to hand-modify the Configure file and insert the -mmacosx-version-min argument into the compiler's command-line arguments that way.
With that change, codesign now applies both SHA-1 and SHA-256 hashes to all of the .dylib files, and the resulting .app now runs as expected under 10.10.x.

","Here's a better algorithm for ya, that will let you switch everyone over at once. You'll have to figure out how to implement this in devise, but here's the outline. This isn't mine, found on the web at the URL noted. 

http://blog.jgc.org/2012/06/one-way-to-fix-your-rubbish-password.html

Suppose you have a database that contains password hashes for the n users of your site, and for each user you have salt si and hash hi (where hi was computed with some algorithm such as SHA1 or MD5).  (Note that the rest of these instructions work if there's no salt, just ignore it).
Suppose that you've chosen to use scrypt.  For each user you first create a new random salt value s'i and then compute a new hash h'i using the formula scrypt(s'i, hi) and store the new salt and hash in the database.  You throw away the old weak hash hi and forget it ever existed. So you are left with two salt values and a new hash.  (I've ignored the other scrypt parameters which are left to the reader to determine).
When user i logs in and presents password p you use your old weak hash algorithm (let's suppose it was md5(salt, password)) to compute a hash for comparison as follows: scrypt(s'i,  md5(si, p)) and compare that with the h'i stored in the database.
If, like last.fm, you were also allowing third-parties to authorize users by presenting the old hash value instead of the password then you can still use this scheme.  When the third-party presents hash h for user i you calculate scrypt(s'i,  h) and do the comparison.
If step 4 is not needed then you can go further when a user logs in.  Once the user has logged in successfully with password p you can completely eliminate any trace of the old weak hash by choosing a new random salt value s''i and computing scrypt(s''i,  p) and storing that in the database.

This has the effect of immediately making your password database more secure if stolen without any effort on the part of your users.

"10943837","PBKDF2 recommended key size?","My function is as follows:
pbkdf2($raw_pw,$salt,1000,128)

1000 is the number of passes, and 128 is the key size. The function returns a binary key which I use base64 to store it in the database.
My question is: what's the recommended keysize and salt size for pbkdf2 using sha512?
will a keysize of 32 be just as secure as a keysize of 128?
","1000 is the number of iterations, not passes. 128 Is the length at the end.
According to Wikipedia (and my own little knowledge about cryptography) you should use more than 128 bits (or 32 as you're asking). The size of the resulting key is equivalent to the chance for a hash collision. Using 256 (as WPA2 does) or 512 should not be a problem, also not a problem for your CPU/memory/whatever.
Also 1000 is, compared to other integrations of pbkdf2, a very small amount of iterations. You can easily use 5000 or 10000 (like iOS4) which might result in something like 10ms more processing time but makes a way more stronger key (see: a possible attacker has also to run the 10k iterations. This might change the time he needs from 1 day to 10 days, or 1 month to almost 1 year).

Creating X-Hub-Signature Header like GitHub API Webhook Requests
My purpose in all this was to simulate the X-Hub-Signature header provided by the GitHub Webhooks API because my web service validates all webhook payloads to match the signature. So for me to test my web service, I also needed postman to generate a valid signature header. 
Here's an adaptation of the above code snippet for generating the X-Hub-Signature request header value.

In GitHub, I set a webhook secret for my GitHub App.



In Postman, I created an environment and added the key=value pair GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET with the value I specified when I created my GitHub App.



In Postman, I used the following pre-request script. It set the computed hash as a global variable.

const hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA1(
    request.data,
    pm.environment.get('GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET')
);
pm.globals.set('X-HUB-SIGNATURE', 'sha1=' + hash);


In Postman, I reference the global hash variable as a header in my requests, just like the GitHub Webhooks API will.

","As others have stated, a single hash collision is unlikely, and multiple nigh on impossible, unless the files are identical. I would recommend generating the sums with an external utility as something of a sanity check. For example, in Ubuntu (and most/all other Linux distributions):
blair@blair-eeepc:~$ md5sum Bandwagon.mp3
b87cbc2c17cd46789cb3a3c51a350557  Bandwagon.mp3
blair@blair-eeepc:~$ sha256sum Bandwagon.mp3

A quick Google search shows there are similar utilities available for Windows machines. If you see the collisions with the external utilities, then the files are identical. If there are no collisions, you are doing something wrong. I doubt the Python implementation is wrong, as I get the same results when doing the hash in Python:
>>> import hashlib
>>> hashlib.md5(open('Bandwagon.mp3', 'r').read()).hexdigest()
'b87cbc2c17cd46789cb3a3c51a350557'

","I sort of have the feeling that you are reading a chunk of data which is smaller than the expected, and this chunk happens to be the same for both files. I don't know why, but try to open the file in binary with 'rb'. read() should read up to end of file, but windows behaves differently. From the docs

On Windows, 'b' appended to the mode
  opens the file in binary mode, so
  there are also modes like 'rb', 'wb',
  and 'r+b'. Python on Windows makes a
  distinction between text and binary
  files; the end-of-line characters in
  text files are automatically altered
  slightly when data is read or written.
  This behind-the-scenes modification to
  file data is fine for ASCII text
  files, but it’ll corrupt binary data
  like that in JPEG or EXE files. Be
  very careful to use binary mode when
  reading and writing such files. On
  Unix, it doesn’t hurt to append a 'b'
  to the mode, so you can use it
  platform-independently for all binary
  files.

","Hash and salt passwords in C#
https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm
https://www.bentasker.co.uk/blog/security/201-why-you-should-be-asking-how-your-passwords-are-stored
As I stated in my comments, hashing passwords is something that you probably shouldn't be doing yourself.
A few things to note:

SHA1 is not recommended for passwords
Passwords should be salted
You should use a verified userstore framework rather than attempting to create your own, as you will likely ""do it wrong""
I'm sure there are many more

That being said, to accomplish your specific question, you would want something like this:
Users
----
userId
passwordHashed

passwordHashed stores a hashed version of the user's password (the plain text password is never stored anywhere in persistence.)
for checking for valid password something like this is done:
ALTER procedure [dbo].[proc_UserLogin]
 @userid varchar(20),
  @password nvarchar(50)
  As 

  declare
  @ReturnVal              varchar(500)


SET NOCOUNT ON      

  if exists(select userid,password from LoginManager where userid=@userid and password=HASHBYTES('SHA1', @password))
  set @ReturnVal='0|Logged in Successfully'
  else
  set @ReturnVal='1|Login Failed/Username does not exist'

  select @ReturnVal

For inserting/updating user passwords, you need to make sure to store the hashed password not the plain text password, as such;
INSERT INTO users(userId, passwordHashed) 
VALUES (@userId, HASHBYTES('SHA1', @rawPassword)

or
UPDATE users 
SET passwordHased = HASHBYTES('SHA1', @rawPassword) 
WHERE userId = @userId

EDIT:
just realized you're asking how to accomplish the hash in C#, not SQL.  You could perform the following (taken from Hashing with SHA1 Algorithm in C#):
public string Hash(byte [] temp)
{
    using (SHA1Managed sha1 = new SHA1Managed())
    {
        var hash = sha1.ComputeHash(temp);
        return Convert.ToBase64String(hash);
    }
}

Your code snip could be:
            conn.Open();
            string query = ""EXEC dbo.proc_UserLogin'"" + username.Text+ ""', '"" + this.Hash(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(password.Text))+""'"";
            OleDbCommand cmd = new OleDbCommand(query, conn);

You should also note that you should parameterize your parameters to your stored procedure rather than passing them in the manner you are - which it looks like you already have a separate question in regarding that.

The trick to getting your key into the CSP is to make a struct to hold 3 things: a BLOBHEADER, a DWORD for the length, and char[] for the key. I will presume you have the raw key data so it would look something like:
struct KeyData
{
  BLOBHEADER hdr;
  unsigned long keyLength;
  unsigned char key[128];
};

void ComputeHash()
{
  HCRYPTPROV cryptoProvider = 0;
  HCRYPTKEY cryptKey = 0;
  KeyData kd;
  kd.hdr.aiKeyAlg = CALG_RC2;
  kd.hdr.bType = PLAINTEXTKEYBLOB;
  kd.hdr.bVersion = CUR_BLOB_VERSION;
  kd.hdr.reserved = 0;
  kd.keyLength = 128;
  /* set your key data here */
  /* get a crypto provider - See the microsoft references */
  CryptImportKey(cryptoProvider, reinterpret_cast<BYTE*>(&kd), sizeof(kd),0, CRYPT_IPSEC_HMAC_KEY, &cryptKey);
  /* use cryptKey in the call to CryptCreateHash when you create your CALG_HMAC */
}

Make sure to replace the lengths with the actual length of your key.

","I was able to solve this by doing the following:

The data to be signed needed to be formatted correctly in a
DigestInfo DER-encoded byte array.  The Signature SHA1withRSA takes
care of this for you, but if you want to accomplish it in a two-step
process, you need to create your own DigestInfo.  I ended up copying
a very minimal amount of ASN.1 classes from BouncyCastle into my
project to accomplish this, despite my desire not to use a third
party lib.
If you try to use the Cipher API to encrypt the DigestInfo, the
PKCS1 padding will be random and not appropriate for a digital
signature.  I needed static padding.
The Signature.getInstance(""NONEwithRSA"", ""SunMSCAPI"") rejects the
DER-encoded DigestInfo format, and will return an error if you try
to sign that data.  But, since I ultimately wanted to use the PKCS11
API to generate the signature, I ended up signing the DER-encoded
DigestInfo with the PKCS11 C_SignInit and C_Sign functions.

To summarize, what worked for me was:

generate the SHA-1 hash of the data to sign using the Java MessageDigest API 
generated a DigestInfo DER-encoded ASN.1 object with the SHA-1 hash and SHA-1 OID embedded in the object. 
signed the DigestInfo using the PKCS11 C_Sign function from a third party library.

","emsworth's answer was when a great help for me when struggling with the same issue (but using SHA512). However it is still missing a hint which takes me a few more days to find out by myself.
There are different ways how the signature is constructed. For example when using RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 (from RFC 5246, TLS 1.2) the DER-encoded DigestInfo is not obtained the usual way. For example if using BouncyCastle
DigestInfo digestInfo = new DigestInfo(new AlgorithmIdentifier(NISTObjectIdentifiers.id_sha512), hash);
byte[] digestedHash = digestInfo.getEncoded(ASN1Encoding.DER);

does not yield the expected results. RFC 3447 defines how to construct the DER encoding on page 42. For example in case of SHA-512 the DER encoding is as follows:
// code example includes MessageDigest for the sake of completeness
byte[] input = ... // the raw data
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-512"");
md.update(input);
byte[] hash = md.digest();

// Taken from RFC 3447, page 42 for SHA-512, create input for signing
byte[] modifierBytes = { 0x30, 0x51, 0x30, 0x0d, 0x06, 0x09, 0x60, (byte) 0x86, 0x48, 0x01, 0x65, 0x03, 0x04, 0x02, 0x03, 0x05, 0x00, 0x04, 0x40 };
ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
baos.write(modifierBytes);
baos2.write(hash);

// create signature
Signature s = Signature.getInstance(""NONEwithRSA"");
s.initSign(MyTlsCredentials.THE_CLIENT_KEY);
s.update(baos.toByteArray());
byte[] signature = s.sign();

// add prefix as specified in RFC 3447, im my case it had always been the shown values
// but I have not understand the RFC completely in this point as the code seems to be
// contradictious to the interpretation of the byte values for the hash function from page 42.
ByteArrayOutputStream baos2 = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
baos2.write(new byte[] { 1, 0 });
baos2.write(signature5);

Pad the message in the usual way: Suppose the length of the message M,
  in bits, is l. Append the bit ""1"" to the end of the message, and then
  k zero bits, where k is the smallest non-negative solution to the
  equation l+1+k  448 mod 512. To this append the 64-bit block which is
  equal to the number l written in binary

But what should one do if the message length in bits is less than 64-bits short of a 512bit block... i.e., there isn't room for the end 64-bit block mentioned above? Or the 64-bit length and the ""1"" bit?
I had a look on wikipedia too, but this doesn't throw any more light on the subject. Google searches haven't been too fruitful either, would appreciate any suggestions :)
Thanks
","If your message is only just short of a full block (less than 65 bits short), you will need your output to be a block longer than your input. In the worst case, if your message is exactly 64 bits short of a full block, you will add a 1 and then 511 0s before the ""number"" bits, but that is how the padding has to work.

Less worried about this. It will be rare that we'll need to decrypt the encrypted version (only if we change the hash algorithm or data format).

","You can increase your hashing algorithm security by using HMAC, a secret key, and a unique salt per entry (I know people will disagree with me on this but it's my belief from my research that it helps avoid certain attacks). You can also use bcrypt or scrypt to hash which will make reversing the hash an extremely time consuming process (but you'll also have to factor this in as time it takes your app to compute the hash).
By disabling code downloads and keeping your secret key protected, I can't imagine how someone can get a hold of it. Just make sure your code is kept protected under similar safe guards or that you remove the secret key from your code during development and only pull it out to deploy. I assume you will keep your secret key in your code (I've heard many people say to keep it in memory to be ultra secure but given the nature of AppEngine and instances, this isn't feasible).
Update:
Be sure to enable 2-factor authentication for all Google accounts that have admin rights to your app. Google offers this so not sure if your restriction for enabling this was imposed by an outside force or not.

","When deciding on a security architecture, the first thing in your mind should always be threat models. Who are your potential attackers, what are their capabilities, and how can you defend against them? Without a clear idea of your threat model, you've got no way to assess whether or not your proposed security measures are sufficient, or even if they're necessary.
From your text, I'm guessing you're seeking to protect against some subset of the following:

An attacker who compromises your datastore data, but not your application code.
An attacker who obtains access to credentials to access the admin console of your app and can deploy new code.

For the former, encrypting or hashing your datastore data is likely sufficient (but see the caveats later in this answer). Protecting against the latter is tougher, but as long as your admin users can't execute arbitrary code without deploying a new app version, storing your keys in a module that's not checked in to source control, as you suggest, ought to work just fine, since even with admin access, they can't recover the keys, nor can they deploy a new version that reveals the keys to them. Make sure to disable downloading of source, obviously.
You rightly note some concerns about hashing of data with a limited amount of entropy - and you're right to be concerned. To some degree, salts can help with this by preventing precomputation attacks, and key stretching, such as that employed in PBKDF2, scrypt, and bcrypt, can make your attacker's life harder by increasing the amount of work they have to do. However, with something like SSN, your keyspace is simply so small that no amount of key stretching is going to help - if you hash the data, and the attacker gets the hash, they will be able to determine the original SSN.
In such situations, your only viable approach is to encrypt the data with a secret key. Now your attacker is forced to brute-force the key in order to get the data, a challenge that is orders of magnitude harder.
In short, my recommendation would be to encrypt your data using a standard (private key) cipher, with the key stored in a module not in source control. Using hashing instead will only weaken your data, while using public key cryptography doesn't provide appreciable security against any plausible threat model that you don't already have by using a standard cipher.
Of course, the number one way to protect your users' data is to not store it in the first place, if you can. :)

","Interesting approach to encrypt data on a datastore. After going through this, one question that comes to my mind is how do you query data on your hashes? Are you using comparison of two hashes or more fine grained hashing? Again how do you accomplish operations like greater than value, less than value after hashing and encrypting the data in your table?
Fine grained hashing meaning, do you hash consecutive bytes of a data stream to get the accumulated hash. i.e hash(abcd) = hash(a,b) + hash (b,c) + etc. This type of hashing would tell how similar the underlying data are rather than a match.

"39607485","SHA256 in React Native","I need to calculate SHA256 hash value of many files in Android and iOS using React Native.  When files are selected by a user, my app will start calculating SHA256 for each file.
For web pages, I have been using crypto-js.  But for Andoid and iOS applications, I am concerned that performance of crypto-js may not be fast enough as a file (eg. video file) may be >400 MB.  
Is there any way that I can call Android/iOS native api to calculate SHA256, instead of using crypto-js for performance sake?
","There isn't anything built into react-native itself to natively calculate a sha-256, but there are a few options.
As @Morre pointed out, react-native-sha256 is an open source project that supports calculating the sha-256 of a string using native components.
Another open source react-native project - react-native-fs - has support for calculating the sha-256 of a file using native components, specifically the hash function.
As @Morre has pointed out, you could write your own native code to provide the same functionality if you would prefer that option. Both of the libraries I mentioned here are open source, so the source code there can be a good reference for what the specific Android/iOS code would need to be written. There are also code examples here on StackOverflow for both java and swift. React-Native's native module documentation (Android) and iOS is extensive.

","PHP's sha1() encodes each byte of the output as hexadecimal by default, but you can get the raw output by passing true as the second argument:
$digest = sha1($password, true); // This returns the same string of bytes as md.digest()

Then pass the digest to base64_encode and you are done:
base64_encode(sha1($password, true));

According to the link above:

The only thumbprint algorithm currently supported is sha1. If you are
  not certain which thumbprint algorithm your certificate supports, you
  can use the certmgr.msc snap in with the Microsoft Management Console
  (MMC) to inspect the certificate.

I've also seen this error when copy->paste the thumbprint from certmgr.msc into the .cscfg files.  This is because non-printable chars are actually copied to the clipboard and pasted into the thumbprint attribute.  Removing these chars by putting your cursor just before the first visible character in the hash and backspacing, alleviates the issue.

","Yes, Azure does support certificates that use SHA256.
To clarify, the Azure is looking at the thumbprint algorithm not the  signature hash algorithm in the ServiceConfiguration.Cloud.cscfg.  The thumbprint is the value used to pull the certificate from the certificate store and is unrelated to the Signature Hash Algorithm.
In the ServiceConfiguration.Cloud.cscfg file, the XML looks like this:
<Certificates>
  <Certificate name=""cert"" thumbprint=""REDACTED"" thumbprintAlgorithm=""sha1"" />
</Certificates>

Notice the above XML in the config specifies the thumbprint algorithm, which is SHA1 even in the case of your certificate that uses SHA256 for Signature Hash Algorithm, if your thumbprint was hashed using SHA256, you would have other schema validation problems because the hash is a different length then SHA1.

Using solutions from some articles and answers, I have RsaPkCs1Sha512SignatureDescription class where I try to implement and register the signature description:
public class RsaPkCs1Sha512SignatureDescription : SignatureDescription
{
    public RsaPkCs1Sha512SignatureDescription()
    {
        KeyAlgorithm = typeof(RSACryptoServiceProvider).FullName;
        DigestAlgorithm = typeof(SHA512Managed).FullName;
        FormatterAlgorithm = typeof(RSAPKCS1SignatureFormatter).FullName;
        DeformatterAlgorithm = typeof(RSAPKCS1SignatureDeformatter).FullName;
    }

    public override AsymmetricSignatureDeformatter CreateDeformatter(AsymmetricAlgorithm key)
    {
        var sigProcessor = (AsymmetricSignatureDeformatter)CryptoConfig.CreateFromName(DeformatterAlgorithm);
        sigProcessor.SetKey(key);
        sigProcessor.SetHashAlgorithm(""SHA-512"");
        return sigProcessor;
    }

    public override AsymmetricSignatureFormatter CreateFormatter(AsymmetricAlgorithm key)
    {
        var sigProcessor =
            (AsymmetricSignatureFormatter)CryptoConfig.CreateFromName(FormatterAlgorithm);
        sigProcessor.SetKey(key);
        sigProcessor.SetHashAlgorithm(""SHA-512"");
        return sigProcessor;
    }
}

I have verified that hash is 64 bytes long and it returns a CryptographicException: Bad Hash. But if I use myHash var (20 bytes long), although algorithm specified in SignHash is SHA512, it works, and sign the hash using SHA1 algorithm.
Also, if I print csp.SignatureAlgorithm, its value is http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1. Why is signature algorithm equals to http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1 if the detail of the installed certificate shows sha512RSA as sign algorithm? Could be this point the real problem? If so, how could I create the certificate properly? Thanks in advance!
","This process has been simplified in .NET 4.6:
byte[] signature;

using (RSA rsa = cert.GetRSAPrivateKey())
{
    signature = rsa.SignHash(hash, HashAlgorithmName.SHA512, RSASignaturePadding.Pkcs1);
}

Note that the .NET 4.6 RSA type no longer requires casting to RSACryptoServiceProvider, and if you use GetRSAPrivateKey() (instead of the PrivateKey property) the returned object is likely to handle SHA-512 signature generation.  GetRSAPrivateKey also returns a unique object each time, so you should Dispose it appropriately.

","It's a bit more difficult if you're doing Universal App.  But to get you started
using Windows.Security.Cryptography;
using Windows.Security.Cryptography.Core;

HashAlgorithmProvider hap = HashAlgorithmProvider.OpenAlgorithm(HashAlgorithmNames.Sha256);   
CryptographicHash ch = hap.CreateHash();

Windows.Storage.Streams.IBuffer b_hash = ch.GetValueAndReset();       // hash it

You have to create a HashAlgorithmProvider and provided it with the HashAlgorithm you want to use 
see HashAlgorithmNames. namespace for all supported Hashes
Then you create a CryptographicHash from the above.
Then you add in bytes into the CryptographicHash using .Append(data)
Then you compute the hash.
Then you can encode it to a hex string if you like.

"19962424","Probability of collision with truncated SHA-256 hash","I have a database-driven web application where the primary keys of all data rows are obfuscated as follows: SHA256(content type + primary key + secret), truncated to the first 8 characters. The content type is a simple word, e.g. ""post"" or ""message"" and the secret is a 20-30 char ASCII constant. The result is stored in a separate indexed column for fast DB lookup.
How do I calculate the probability of a hash collision in this scenario? I am not a mathematician at all, but a friend claimed that due to the Birthday Paradox the collision probability would be ~1% for 10,000 rows with an 8-char truncation. Is there any truth to this claim?
","Yes, there is a collision probability & it's probably somewhat too high. The exact probability depends on what ""8 characters"" means.
Does ""8 characters"" mean:

A) You store 8 hex characters of the hash?  That would store 32 bits.
B) You store 8 characters of BASE-64? That would store 48 bits.
C) You store 8 bytes, encoded in some single-byte charset/ or hacked in some broken way into a character encoding?  That would store 56-64 bits, but if you don't do encoding right you'll encounter character conversion problems.
D) You store 8 bytes, as bytes? That genuinely stores 64 bits of the hash.

Storing binary data as either A) hex or D) binary bytes, would be my preferred options. But I'd definitely recommend either reconsidering your ""key obfuscation"" scheme or significantly expanding the stored key-size to reduce the (currently excessive) probability of key collision.
From Wikipedia:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Cast_as_a_collision_problem
The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to hash functions: the expected number of N-bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2^N, but rather only 2^(N/2).
Since in the most conservative above understanding of your design (reading it as A, 8 chars of hex == 32 bits) your scheme would be expected to suffer collisions if it stored on the scale of ~64,000 rows. I would consider such an outcome unacceptable for all serious, or even toy, systems.
Transaction tables may have volumes, allowing growth for the business, from 1000 - 100,000 transactions/day (or more). Systems should be designed to function 100 years (36500 days), with a 10x growth factor built in, so.. 
For your keying mechanism to be genuinely robust & professionally useful, you would need to be able to scale it up to potentially handle ~36 billion (2^35) rows without collision. That would imply 70+ bits of hash.
The source-control system Git, for example, stores 160 bits of SHA-1 hash (40 chars of hex == 20 bytes or 160 bits). Collisions would not be expected to be probable with < less than 2^80 different file revisions stored.

A possibility better design might be, rather than hashing & pseudo-randomizing the key entirely & hoping (against hope) to avoid collisions, to prepend/ append/ fold-in 8-10 bits of a hash into the key.
This would generates a larger key, containing all the uniqueness of the original key plus 8-10 bits of verification.  Attempts to access keys would then be verified, and more than 3 invalid requests would be treated as an attempt to violate security by ""probing"" the keyspace & would trigger semi-permanent lockout. 
The only major costs here, would be a modest reduction in the size of the available keyspace for a given int-size.  32-bit int to/from the browser would have 8-10 bits dedicated to security, thus leaving 22-24 for the actual key. So you'd use 64-bit ints where that was not sufficient.

<script src=""https://raw.github.com/Caligatio/jsSHA/master/src/sha1.js""></script>

The remote copy works well for me, now, thanks to this excellent answer by @Andreas here.
But it leaves me with a new question:  what's the rationale for including a copy vs. referring to a remote js library?  Is it like 'vendoring' the library, insulating my app from subsequent changes in the code?
","It comes down to whether or not the developer is happy with you 'hotlinking' to the JS library.  
Regarding the specific URL that you have posted, 
https://raw.github.com/Caligatio/jsSHA/master/src/sha1.js

I would be wary of referencing that.  It is the master branch of their source code, they may include breaking changes at any time.  They may even decide to move and restructure their codebase, in which case your application will break as the URL above will lead to a 404.
The better solution is indeed referencing a specific version of the library.  This ensures that your application behaves, and will continue to behave, in an expected and known manner as far as the jsSHA library is concerned.  
There are a few ways to do this.  You can reference a specific, fixed URL that explicitly specifies a version
http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.0.2/build/rollups/hmac-sha1.js

Because its tagged (3.0.2), you are a bit safer, but you are still referencing source control.  This should really be done via a CDN if one exists.  I do not believe that the googlecode.com URL is a CDN URL (I could be wrong).  It is of course a common practice to use a proper CDN or external link to reference a JS library and you can see an example of this on the JQuery page, but this is often done as part of page performance enhancements.  A CDN is optimized for a user's geographic location so a reference to any content on a CDN (as opposed to the main server) will be served faster.  It has user experience benefits.  It's useful if page load times are important for your userbase.
The alternative, and the safest way, is to keep a copy of the JS library in your own source control and reference it using your own infrastructure.  It's with you, it is a fixed version and there are no surprises if something changes, such as restructuring, sites going down, and so on.

","If your application is available on the WWW, you should consider using a well-known external URL. 

<script type=""text/javascript""
   src=""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.0/jquery.min.js""
</script> 

This example below gets the minified version of jquery 1.8.0 from google's servers.


The benefit obtained by this method comes from caching:  

You do not want the first visit a potential user makes to your website to be slow and disappointing. If your first-time visitor has visited my site which uses this URL for jQuery, her browser will probably have cached it so it will not need to load it.
Using immutable versioned resources (jquery/1.8.0 instead of something like jquery/current) both helps developers not have to track down breaking changes in their production code and ensures that these resources can be cached.
If the resource has to be downloaded and the URL is hosted on a CDN you are likely to get lower latency as the resource will probably be loaded from a server closer to the user's network.  The URL in the example is hosted on Google Hosted Libraries which is a CDN.  See https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide for more information.

Another argument often seen in such discussions is that when the resource has to be downloaded, you will be able to get better client-side resource loading parallelism if the resource is not on your own servers together with 10 more resources your page includes because browsers limit themselves to loading up to a small number (6 or so in modern browsers) of resources form the same server.  
If your internet-wide web application is security-critical, you must keep control of as much of it as you can securely manage (and static immutable or nearly immutable resources are relatively easy to manage securely). 

If my bank's e-banking application which runs over HTTPS were to rely on google's HTTP servers for serving, it would both be granting Google authority over the client-side part of its e-banking application and eliminating practically all benefits of the HTTPS connection to its servers. There are very few things that a rogue client script cannot do...



If your application is accessed locally, you should probably include it in your application for both performance (access to your servers should be faster than accessing some remote server both in terms of latency and in terms of bandwidth) and reliability reasons (you are not relying on the external internet connection and on the remote servers being up and running).

"25536341","Spring LDAP - How to manage encoded (SHA) password","I want to implement a basic user repository using Spring LDAP and it's concept of Object-Directory Mapping (ODM).
My User class is pretty straightforward :
@Entry(objectClasses = { ""inetOrgPerson"", ""organizationalPerson"", ""person"", ""shadowAccount"", ""top"" }, base = ""ou=people"")
public class User {
    [...]

    @Id
    private Name dn;

    @Attribute(name = ""givenName"")
    private String firstName;

    @Attribute(name = ""sn"")
    private String lastName;

    @Attribute(name = ""o"")
    private String organization;

    @Attribute(name = ""userPassword"")
    private String password;

    // Getters & Setters
    [...]
}

And basic methods of my repository :
public User findByUid(String uid) {
    return ldapTemplate.findOne(query().where(""uid"").is(uid), User.class);
}

public void update(User user) {
    ldapTemplate.update(user);
}

Everything works fine except for the password attribute. For example, if I change only the user first name, the password is also changed.
I want to know how to deal with an encoded password (using the SHA - Secure Hashing Algorithm).
I don't see any annotations allowing to specify the encoding method.
Do we have to deal with it manually?
","Short version
@Attribute(name = ""userPassword"", type = Type.BINARY)
private byte[] password;

is the correct definition of your password attribute. This is because LDAP stores the password as binary too.
To provide a convenient way of interaction, you should modify the setter for password
public void setPassword(String password) {
    this.password = password.getBytes(Charset.forName(""UTF-8""));
}

Long version
The problem is your definition of userPassword. It is a java.lang.String. And the Spring LDAP ODM Attribute annotation defaults to Type.STRING
Your LDAP gets the string as byte array and checks if it has a proper prefix (in our case {SSHA}). If there is no prefix present it hashes the given string with its configured hash algorithm and stores it in the attribute as binary. Here lays the root cause. Your attribute definition differs. LDAP has a binary, you have a string.
When you read the entry again, to modify the first name, the password attribute gets read too. But, as it should be a string in the object, Spring converts the binary array to a string. This conversion is wrong, as it creates a string.
e.g.

you put test in the password field of your entity object.
Spring takes the string and sends it unmodified to the LDAP server.
the server hashes the string and saves it as {SSHA}H97JD...
you read the entry again
spring gets a byte[] containing the ascii numbers representing the stored value
[123, 83, 83, 72, 65, 125, 72, 57, 55, 74, 68, ...]
a conversion to a string results in the following:
123,83,83,72,65,125,72,57,55,74,68,...
spring sets this string in your entity as password value
you modify the first name
spring takes the password string again and sends it as is to the server
the servers prefix check indicates an unhashed password and applies the hash algorithm again on the string, because 123,83, starts not with {SSHA}
the server changes the password again.

    char[] hexChars = new char[bytes.length * 2];
    int v;

I think I am generating CRT Certificates in PEM format, but it seems my key is not in PEM format !?
Here is what I do, and what I get.
I create a CSR with:
openssl req -nodes -new -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -out test.csr
This generate 2 files:
privkey.pem and test.csr 
Now when I try and update some servers, they complain that my Private key is not in PEM format. nginx and apache seem happy with my key.
When I then convert the key with:
openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out privkey.rsa.pem
It works !?! 
vimdiff shows me the difference in the files visually, and one can see that not only is the heading different, but the content is also been changed (after the first 4 characters)
And thus my question
is the key created in DER - PEM format, even though I specify not to use DER in the create line ?
","The only way I have found to generate a key in RSA format is to first create the keyfile with 
openssl genrsa -out ./yourkeyfile.key 2048

and then use the file to create a CSR with 
openssl req -new -sha256 -key yourkeyfile.key -out yourcsrfile.csr

If you use the one line command the keyfile is created in DER format.

","Your signature is a 20 byte (160 bit) long byte array.
So it's basically a very long number.
When you show it, you are converting it into a hex string, so each byte is shown as 2 chars, so you get a 40 chars long string.
Base64 encoding gives you 4 chars every 3 bytes of payload to encode.
If you encode in base64 20 bytes of binary data you get 26.6 bytes, rounded up to 28 (you round up every 4 bytes).
If you encode your 40 characters long string (320 bits), you get 53,3 characters, again rounded up to 56.

My problem is that what I write in the password field is interpreted as an SHA encoded password so when I try to sign in with the new user, I can't. How can I solve this? Is there a way to force Spring to encrypt the password that I write in the password field?
","At user authentication time
Spring security's authentication manager should be configured so that it encodes plain text passwords received from the login form using SHA beforehand. 
This is explained in this chapter of Spring Security's documentation, at the paragraph ""Adding a Password Encoder"". It is basically adding this line of configuration : 
<authentication-provider>
    <password-encoder hash=""sha""/>
    ...
</authentication-provider>

At user creation time
Before you store a new user, you should encode ""by yourself"" the password, Spring security does not handle it. 
In your case, you can use the ShaPasswordEncoder.encodePassword(..) method.

","You should calculate hmac(salt : userid : timestamp+2hours, secret) and transmit salt : userid : timestamp+2hours : hash.
Purpose of salt here is to make plaintext longer and not repeating, so it better be appended to plaintext, not secret.

"23639952","When using SHA-256 hashes as a primary key, is it OK to ignore the possibility of collisions?","I have this situation where I have files on the HDD and I want to cache information about them in a database. Information that would otherwise take a long time to parse given that some of these files can run into GBs. 
My first intuition is to use the file path as a unique identifier for a file and I use that as the key (TEXT/VARCHAR) and store the information as value in a database table.
Given that under some file systems (especially in *nix), file paths can be of unlimited length. It seems like a bad idea to use file name as a primary key in a database. Just indexing on a string field is going to be much slower, not to mention memory/space constraints.
I thought, maybe, I generate SHA-256 hash from the full file path (/usr/xxx/1/2/../abc.xyz)  and use this as primary key (fixed width) in my database. Another thought, would be to generate the SHA-256 hash from file contents. However, this can also become quite time consuming. 
My question is - in this scenario, are hash collisions as equally less likely, as the answer provided on this excellent thread.
","To answer your question, you would only be likely have issues with hash collisions if you were to approach 2^128 files in your table. This assumes that all inputs are between 0 .. +INF in length and that the hash algorithm you are using is perfect (SHA-256 is considered perfect in practice but not proven in theory) and that the output size is exactly 256 bits.
If you have under a few billion files, you should be fine.
Now for my recommendation. I would say that you need to tell us more information about your intended use. Your first thought is closer to correct than your hashing approach.
I would use a table like this (T-SQL Syntax for SQL Server):
CREATE TABLE [File]
(
    [Id] BIGINT IDENTITY NOT NULL,
    [Path] CHARACTER VARYING(MAX) NOT NULL

    PRIMARY KEY([Id])
);

CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [File_Path_IX] ON [File]([Path]);

Then, you should let your database take care of indexing and making the searches fast.
If and only if you experience a major performance issue later down the road, demonstrated by profiling, should you consider changing to a hashing approach. The hashing will impose massive computational penalty on your preprocessing and will introduce complicated scenarios such as hash collisions and trying to resolve them if and when they do happen.

Can these hashing algorithms be broken up to run across multiple cores/threads ?
","If you're wondering about parallelizing the execution of computing a single hash (regardless of flavor 1, 256, or 512) then the answer is sadly no. That is because of the way the SHA transform function is defined. It operates on blocks of fixed size but the output of the transformation of each block is required by next so you can't run the computations in parallel.
Obviously it is possible to run multiple hashes in parallel, for different input strings, but that I assume you already knew.
If all you wanted was to generate digests for large inputs using underlying SHA transforms you could define an arbitrary scheme for segmenting the input and then generating digest blocks for each segment in parallel. Then combine those and so on..
Something like this:
 | ------------------ large input ---------------------------------------------|

 |    b0     |    b1    |    b2    |          |          |          |    bn    |

You can generate H(b0), H(b1), .. H(bn) in parallel.
Then, generate H_OUT = H(H(b0) + H(b1) + .. + H(bn)) (where the + sign could be concatenation or a simple XOR but these would very likely not be cryptographically strong).
This method will benefit from multiple cores but H_OUT will not be equivalent to computing  a single hash of the original large input.

However, when I try to log in I get a Bad credentials error. What is happening?
I can't really manage to find a way of how to debug this because it's all happening internally in spring security I guess so I can't get to know what queries are actually being made and I can't/don't know where to look to figure out why this is failing.
","Look at the debug log output when you try to authenticate as the user (always a good idea). Most likely it says it can't find the user ""johnny"".
This is most likely because you have both a jdbc-user-service and a user-service in the same authentication-provider which won't work.
Use two separate authentication-provider elements:
<authentication-provider>
    <jdbc-user-service ... />
</authentication-provider>
<authentication-provider>
    <user-service>
       ....
    </user-service>
</authentication-provider>

Also, as I said in your other question, you shouldn't use SHA as a password hashing algorithm unless it's for a legacy system.

The whole point of salting is to defeat ""rainbow tables"":
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table
See why a sufficiently long salt defeats any rainbow table under the section ""Defense against rainbow tables"".

how is that more secure?

It used to be more secure because it forced the attacker to try a, back then, very costly brute-force approach instead of an instant looked in precomputed rainbow tables. If you had a 64 bit salt, the attacker needed to have 2^64 precomputed rainbow tables instead of one...  In other words: it made rainbow tables useless.
Note however that modern GPUs can crack billions of passwords per second making it mostly pointless for an attacker to store huge rainbow tables (instead of storing billions of hashes, simply compute them in a few seconds).
Nowadays you want to store your ""passwords"" using something like PBKDF2 or scrypt.

","An attacker is ""allowed"" to know the salt - your security must be designed in a way that even with the knowledge of the salt it is still secure.
What does the salt do ?
Salt aids in defending against brute-force attacks using pre-computed ""rainbow-tables"".
Salt makes brute-force much more expensive (in time/memory terms) for the attacker.
Calculating such a table is expensive and usually only done when it can be used for more than one attack/password.
IF you use the same salt for all password an attacker could pre-compute such a table and then brute-force your passwords into cleartext... 
As long as you generate a new (best cryptogrpahically strong) random salt for every password you want to store the hash of there is no problem.
IF you want to strengthen the security further
You could calculate the hash several times over (hash the hash etc.) - this doesn't cost you much but it makes a brute-force attack / calculating ""rainbow-tables"" even more expensive... please don't invent yourself - there are proven standard methods to do so, see for example http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2 and http://www.itnewb.com/tutorial/Encrypting-Passwords-with-PHP-for-Storage-Using-the-RSA-PBKDF2-Standard
NOTE: 
Using such a mechanism is these days mandatrory since ""CPU time"" (usable for attacks like rainbow tables/brute force etc.) is getting more and more widely available (see for example the fact that Amazon's Cloud service is among the top 50 of fastest supercomuters worldwide and can be used by anyone for a comparatively small amount)!

","The questions below are from the sister site Security StackExchange. They discuss hashing, salts, PBKDF2, bcrypt, scrypt, and a few other things.

How to securely hash passwords?
Do any security experts recommend bcrypt for password storage?

There's also some previous discussion from here on StackOverflow as well:
Is BCrypt a good hashing algorithm to use in C#? Where can I find it?
In short answer to you question, a salt is a safeguard that makes it take a long time to recover a password in the event of compromise just as a hash is. If attacking one password, the salt won't make a difference. If trying to use a pre-computed dictionary or test many passwords at the same time, having a different salt for each entry will greatly increase the amount of work needed and generally make generating a suitable rainbow table infeasible.

","There is no such language that supports binary data strings in the code. You need to encode the binary data into some format such as Hex or Base64 and let CryptoJS decode it into it's own internal binary format which you then can pass to the various CryptoJS functions:

var wordArrayFromHex = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(""74657374""); // ""test""
var wordArrayFromB64 = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(""dGVzdA==""); // ""test""

Other functions are:
wordArrayFromHex.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8)  // ""test""
CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.stringify(wordArrayFromB64) // ""test""

If you pass a string into a CrypoJS function (not these here), it will be assumed to be a Utf8-encoded string. If you don't want that, you need to decode it yourself.

"14850674","How much faster is the native implementation of the native cryptographic hashes on Windows than the .Net Managed version?","I'm providing hashes for sets of data in order to fingerprint the data and identify it by hash - this is the core use case for fast hashes like SHA1 and MD5.
In .Net, there is an option to go with the native or managed implementations of some of these hashes (the SHA variants, anyway). I'm looking for an MD5 managed implementation, and there doesn't appear to be one in the .Net Framework, but wondered if the wrapped native CSP is faster anyway, and if I should just use it content that there will be no perf problems using it. The top answer to Why is there no managed MD5 implementation in the .NET framework? indicates that faster performance could be the reason that a managed variant doesn't exist.
Is this true, and if so, how much faster is the native CSP?
","Unfortunately, the wrapped native CSP for MD5 - MD5CryptoServiceProvider - is significantly slower than a pure managed implementation. It is an obstinate viewpoint that holds that native code is unequivocally faster than managed code: in many cases the opposite is true. This is such a case, at least in head-to-head measurements.
Using the translated reference MD5 implementation by David Anson, I constructed a quick performance test (source) which aims to measure any large differences in performance between the two implementations. While for small data arrays the difference are negligible, as expected, at around 16kB the native implementation starts to show potentially significant delay - on the order of milliseconds. This might not seem like much, but it is orders of magnitude slower than the pure managed implementation. This difference is maintained as the size of the data being hashed increases, and at the largest tested data array - ~250MB - the difference in CPU time was about 8.5 seconds. Considering that a hash like this is often used to fingerprint very large files, this extra delay would become noticeable, even against the often much larger delays from I/O.
It's not abundantly clear where the delay comes from, since a pure native test was not performed (one which would dispense with the wrapping of a CSP and consumption in managed code), but given the nearly identical shape of the graphs on the log scale, it would appear that the managed and native implementations have the same intrinsic performance, but that the native code performance is ""shifted"" down in performance likely due to the cost of the interop between native and managed code at runtime. This performance difference between wrapped native CSPs and pure managed implementations has also been reproduced and documented by other investigators.
In addition to answering the question ""how much faster is the native implementation"" in this particular case, I hope this evidence serves to prompt more reflection and investigation when the question of native vs. managed arises, breaking the long-standing and pernicious reaction to similar questions that native code is always faster, and thus, somehow, better. Managed code is clearly very fast, even in this performance-sensitive domain of bulk data hashing.

The OP (Pimp Trizkit), is the one who found the right solution. I just used his solution (with minor change) to showcase the result and to have fun. All rights reserved)
Also, the bytes array to hex string converting algorithm offered by the OP  is much faster, than the ones in my example code. See his solution for the implementation.
(For the details read the comments down below)

One of the manual solutions:
(Important! It was my first answer, but it's only for getting hash from the text string, not from the hex string as the OP asked. See the update below):

import java.security.MessageDigest;

public class TestHash {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String password = ""9a"";

        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-1"");
        md.update(password.getBytes());
        byte[] byteData = md.digest();
        // byte[] byteData = md.digest(password.getBytes());    // both updates and completes the hash computation

        // Method 1 of converting bytes to hex format
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
        for (int i = 0; i < byteData.length; i++) {
            sb.append(Integer.toString((byteData[i] & 0xFF) + 0x100, 16).substring(1));
        }

        System.out.println(""1) Hex format : "" + sb.toString());

        // Method 2 of converting bytes to hex format
        StringBuffer hexString = new StringBuffer();
        for (int i = 0; i < byteData.length; i++) {
            String hex = Integer.toHexString(0xff & byteData[i]);
            // NB! E.g.: Integer.toHexString(0x0C) will return ""C"", not ""0C""            
            if (hex.length() == 1) {
                hexString.append('0');
            }
            hexString.append(hex);
        }
        System.out.println(""2) Hex format : "" + hexString.toString());      
    }
}

Output:
1) Hex format : e8eef065fb7295044d65b305bab18a9a645d1abf
2) Hex format : e8eef065fb7295044d65b305bab18a9a645d1abf

","I figured it out! Thanks to Louis Wasserman for inspiration in his comment to my question. When I used 000000000000009a with HashCalc it returned the same result as my function! I realized that I was forcing a certain data length (the length of a long). Turns out it needs to be an arbitrary length (like HashCalc... as I said, I needed to duplicate the HashCalc behavior, not just for 9a or what ever small test case we use, but for all possible data). Even longer than long. So these other solutions don't work here.
I got around this by converting the original hex string to a char[] array then concat them together in pairs and converting to a byte, in a loop, storing each in the byte[] that is passed to digest. This worked! Then I saw Kan's comment to his answer on  this, and showed me I was just reinventing the wheel there.
So here is the final code, and its amazingly the same size as the original:
private String HexToSHA1(String ss) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    MessageDigest md = null;
    try { md = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-1""); }
    catch ( Exception e ) {}
    return byteArrayToHexString(md.digest(DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary(ss)));
}

This runs pretty quick, not sure if there is even a faster way. Of course thats also based on how fast your byteArrayToHexString function is. Here is mine:
private String byteArrayToHexString(byte[] data) {
    char[] toDigits =  {'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'};
    int l = data.length;
    char[] out = new char[l << 1];
    for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < l; i++) {
        out[j++] = toDigits[(0xF0 & data[i]) >>> 4];
        out[j++] = toDigits[0x0F & data[i]];
    }
    return new String(out);
}

And its pretty fast. Credit to someone somewhere. I didn't write it.
EDIT:
Moving char[] toDigits =  {'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'}; to the global (or ""up one in scope"") makes it faster still.

If someone finds out your salt, then they can reconstruct your hashes and flood your system.  In this case you'd want to make sure that a user requested addition of their e-mail address to whatever you're creating.  (That is, I wouldn't get rid of storing the hash in the DB altogether.)

I am using java so my java code is

","This is your most immediate problem:
byte pass[] = md.digest();
System.out.println(pass.toString());

You're not returning the hash of the string. You're returning the result of calling toString() on a byte[]. Arrays in Java don't override toString(), so you get the default implementation, which has everything to do with the identity of the object and nothing to do with the data in the byte array:

The toString method for class Object returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the object is an instance, the at-sign character `@', and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object.

(Arrays don't override hashCode() either, so that's obtained from the default implementation in Object too...)
Basically, you need a different way of converting a byte[] to a String... or store the byte array directly in the database, of course. If you do want to convert to a string, I suggest you use either hex or base64. For base64, I'd suggest the iharder.net public domain library... or if you're using Java 8, you can use java.util.Base64. (It's astonishing that it took so long to get a base64 class into the standard libraries in a context other than XML etc, but there we go.)
return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(md.digest());

Your code has an additional problem though:
md.update(clearTextPassword.getBytes());

This uses the platform default encoding to convert the password into a byte array. That's not a good idea - it means you could end up getting different hashes based on what system your code is running on. It's better to specify the encoding explicitly:
md.update(clearTextPassword.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));

Additionally, catching an exception if SHA-256 is missing, logging and continuing with a blank string is almost certainly the wrong approach. Do you really want to populate your database with empty strings, allowing anyone to log in with any password? If your system is in that state, the best thing you can do is almost certainly to fail any request to do anything with passwords. You probably want to convert the NoSuchAlgorithmException into some sort of RuntimeException and rethrow.
Finally, storing a simple SHA-256 hash probably isn't a good idea anyway.

You probably want an HMAC instead
You should at least use a random salt to avoid the same passwords having the same values in the database. (Otherwise, an attacker can use that information to their advantage.)

I'm far from an expert on security, so I won't advise you much further on the right way to do things - but I would actually suggest trying to find a well-respected library written by security experts rather than trying to implement this yourself. Security it very hard to do right.

","You will definitely get a hash collision for a given GUID that was pulled more than once on the same day. For example, if you generate a hash for a particular GUID g, then pulling g at 2012-02-20 at 12:00 yields the same hash as if you pulled it at 18:00, since you only take into account the date, and not the time.
For unrelated GUIDs, it is still possible to have a hash collision. The space of possible hashes is 64 bits, which is less than infinity, which means that there are bound to be repeats by virtue of the pigeonhole principle. However, it's exceedingly unlikely -- in fact, it's so unlikely that you should treat it as zero.

You can manually construct a whole valid repository identical to another, by editing the .git/objects files, but because newer commits contain the hashes of older commits this will of course have to be exactly identical.

What I would like to know though is, what exactly does git do to assure commit hashes are always unique even if they do the exact same operations with exactly the same contents.

Nothing.  If you create the same contents, you get the same SHA-1.
First, however, you need to realize that ""same contents"" of a commit means that—provided you don't get an accidental SHA-1 collision1 or find a way to break SHA-1—you must create the same complete repository history leading up to and including the commit itself, including all the same trees, author-names, time-stamps, and so on.
This is because the contents of a commit are what you see if you run git cat-file -p <sha-1> on a commit (plus the tag-and-size field that says ""this object is of type commit"", so that there are no trivial ways to break things by creating a blob with the same contents as a previous commit).  Here's one as an example:
$ git cat-file -p 996b0fdbb4ff63bfd880b3901f054139c95611cf

Note that this string includes the tree and its SHA-1, both of this commit's parent SHA-1s, the author and timestamp, the committer and timestamp, and the message.  If you change even a single bit of this—such as by trying to change the underlying tree, or using some different parent commit(s)—you will get a new, different SHA-1, rather than 996b0fdbb4ff63bfd880b3901f054139c95611cf.
So the answer to this:

So in theory if me and you do exactly the same steps at exactly the same time with exactly the same configured author, email etc, we would actually get the same commit SHA key?

is ""yes"".  However ... you must start with the same staging area (this is what will become the tree), and the same parent commits.  If you then configure your author, email, etc., exactly the same as the other guy, and both of you create a new commit at the same second (or using git's environment variables2 to force the time stamps), you both get the same new commit.
Which is precisely what we want.  It doesn't matter if you create it, when you're named ""me"", or I create it, when I'm named ""me"", if all the rest of the contents are the same.  Because whoever creates it, the other ""me"" can clone it, and then we both have the same thing that way too.
(If I want to be sure that the ""me"" that creates something is not confused with the real me, I need to add something unique, that I know and the other me doesn't.  Of course, if I publish this thing somewhere, the other me know knows it.  But this is what signed, annotated tags are for.  They can contain a GPG signature.)

1The chances of an accidental hash collision (for any pair of objects; chances rise with more objects) are 1 out of 2160, which is ... very small. :-)  The rise is actually very rapid, so that by the time you have a million objects, it's about 1 out of 2121.  The formula I use here is:
1 - exp(((-(n * (n-1))) / (2 * r))
where r = 2160 and n is the number of objects.  Without the subtraction from 1, the equation calculates the ""safety margin"", as it were: the chance that we won't have an accidental hash collision.  If we want to keep this number in the same range as the safety margin that a disk drive won't read back the wrong contents for a file—or at least, that disk-makers claim—we need to keep it around 10-18, which means we need to avoid putting more than about 1.7 quadrillion (1.7E15) objects in our git databases.
2There are many git environment variables that you can set to override various defaults.  The ones for the author and committer, including date and email, are:

GIT_AUTHOR_NAME
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL
GIT_AUTHOR_DATE
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE

The author name, email
The author commit timestamp

The committer timestamp

The reason the examples with --date from other answers haven't worked is because you need to override both the committer timestamp and the author timestamp.

","MD5 produces an 128 bit hash. (16 byte)
sha, depending of whether is sha1 or sha256 produces either 160 bit (20 byte) or 256 bit (32 byte) hash.
Note that I'm talking about binary length/strength. The longer the less likely a collision occurs.
The fact that most users stick it into a DB field or whatnot makes it convenient to convert it to ASCII using varions binary-ascii conversion algos. This should not influence the strength of collision probability at all since you'll end up with a larger ASCII string.
FWIW I've been using SHA1, SHA256 in crypto products in binary form for over 5 years and I'd recommend choosing hashes in this following order, from the strongest to the weakest: SHA256, SHA1, MD5. There is a website that can ""reverse"" MD5 so I'd strongly suggest against it.

","You're starting from false premise -- they produce a result that can (does) include all 8-bit values from 0 to 255. Just for example, one of the test vectors for SHA-256 is an input of ""abc"". The result from this (in hexadecimal) is:
ba7816bf 8f01cfea 414140de 5dae2223 b00361a3 96177a9c b410ff61 f20015ad

Just within that test, the result includes bytes with values from 0x03 to 0xff.
For display, that may be (often is) rendered in something like hexadecimal. For transmission in email they're often encoded with something like MIME or UUENCODE. The hash itself, however, is not limited in this way.

"45385707","How to efficiently hash (SHA 256) in golang data where only the last few bytes changes","Assuming you had 80 bytes of data and only the last 4 bytes was constantly changing, how would you efficiently hash the total 80 bytes using Go. In essence, the first 76 bytes are the same, while the last 4 bytes keeps changing. Ideally, you want to keep a copy of the hash digest for the first 76 bytes and just keep changing the last 4.
","You can try the following examples on the Go Playground. Benchmark results is at the end.
Note: the implementations below are not safe for concurrent use; I intentionally made them like this to be simpler and faster.
Fastest when using only public API (always hashes all input)
The general concept and interface of Go's hash algorithms is the hash.Hash interface. This does not allow you to save the state of the hasher and to return or rewind to the saved state. So using the public hash APIs of the Go standard lib, you always have to calculate the hash from start.
What the public API offers is to reuse an already constructed hasher to calculate the hash of a new input, using the Hash.Reset() method. This is nice so that no (memory) allocations will be needed to calculate multiple hash values. Also you may take advantage of the optional slice that may be passed to Hash.Sum() which is used to append the current hash to. This is nice so that no allocations will be needed to receive the hash results either.
Here's an example that takes advantage of these:
type Cached1 struct {
    hasher hash.Hash
    result [sha256.Size]byte
}

func NewCached1() *Cached1 {
    return &Cached1{hasher: sha256.New()}
}

func (c *Cached1) Sum(data []byte) []byte {
    c.hasher.Reset()
    c.hasher.Write(data)
    return c.hasher.Sum(c.result[:0])
}

Test data
We'll use the following test data:
var fixed = bytes.Repeat([]byte{1}, 76)
var variantA = []byte{1, 1, 1, 1}
var variantB = []byte{2, 2, 2, 2}

var data = append(append([]byte{}, fixed...), variantA...)
var data2 = append(append([]byte{}, fixed...), variantB...)

var c1 = NewCached1()

First let's get authentic results (to verify if our hasher works correctly):
fmt.Printf(""%x\n"", sha256.Sum256(data))
fmt.Printf(""%x\n"", sha256.Sum256(data2))

Output:
fb8e69bdfa2ad15be7cc8a346b74e773d059f96cfc92da89e631895422fe966a
10ef52823dad5d1212e8ac83b54c001bfb9a03dc0c7c3c83246fb988aa788c0c

Now let's check our Cached1 hasher:
fmt.Printf(""%x\n"", c1.Sum(data))
fmt.Printf(""%x\n"", c1.Sum(data2))

Output is the same:
fb8e69bdfa2ad15be7cc8a346b74e773d059f96cfc92da89e631895422fe966a
10ef52823dad5d1212e8ac83b54c001bfb9a03dc0c7c3c83246fb988aa788c0c

Even faster but may break (in future Go releases): hashes only the last 4 bytes
Now let's see a less flexible solution which truly calculates the hash of the first 76 fixed part only once.
The hasher of the crypto/sha256 package is the unexported sha256.digest type (more precisely a pointer to this type):
// digest represents the partial evaluation of a checksum.
type digest struct {
    h     [8]uint32
    x     [chunk]byte
    nx    int
    len   uint64
    is224 bool // mark if this digest is SHA-224
}

A value of the digest struct type basically holds the current state of the hasher.
What we may do is feed the hasher the fixed, first 76 bytes, and then save this struct value. When we need to caclulate the hash of some 80 bytes data where the first 76 is the same, we use this saved value as a starting point, and then feed the varying last 4 bytes.
Note that it's enough to simply save this struct value as it contains no pointers and no descriptor types like slices and maps. Else we would also have to make a copy of those, but we're ""lucky"". So this solution would need adjustment if a future implementation of crypto/sha256 would add a pointer or slice field for example.
Since sha256.digest is unexported, we can only use reflection (reflect package) to achieve our goals, which inherently will add some delays to computation.
Example implementation that does this:
type Cached2 struct {
    origv   reflect.Value
    hasherv reflect.Value
    hasher  hash.Hash

    result [sha256.Size]byte
}

func NewCached2(fixed []byte) *Cached2 {
    h := sha256.New()
    h.Write(fixed)

    c := &Cached2{origv: reflect.ValueOf(h).Elem()}
    hasherv := reflect.New(c.origv.Type())
    c.hasher = hasherv.Interface().(hash.Hash)
    c.hasherv = hasherv.Elem()

    return c
}

func (c *Cached2) Sum(data []byte) []byte {
    // Set state of the fixed hash:
    c.hasherv.Set(c.origv)

    c.hasher.Write(data)
    return c.hasher.Sum(c.result[:0])
}

Testing it:
var c2 = NewCached2(fixed)
fmt.Printf(""%x\n"", c2.Sum(variantA))
fmt.Printf(""%x\n"", c2.Sum(variantB))

Output is again the same:
fb8e69bdfa2ad15be7cc8a346b74e773d059f96cfc92da89e631895422fe966a
10ef52823dad5d1212e8ac83b54c001bfb9a03dc0c7c3c83246fb988aa788c0c

So it works.
The ""ultimate"", fastest solution
Cached2 could be faster if reflection would not be involved. If we want an even faster solution, simply we can make a copy of the sha256.digest type and its methods into our package, so we can directly use it without having to resort to reflection.
If we do this, we will have access to the digest struct value, and we can simply make a copy of it like:
var d digest
// init d
saved := d

And restoring it is like:
d = saved

I simply ""cloned"" the crypto/sha256 package to my workspace, and changed / exported the digest type as Digest just for demonstration purposes. Then using this mysha256.Digest type I implemented Cached3 like this:
type Cached3 struct {
    orig   mysha256.Digest
    result [sha256.Size]byte
}

func NewCached3(fixed []byte) *Cached3 {
    var d mysha256.Digest
    d.Reset()
    d.Write(fixed)

    return &Cached3{orig: d}
}

func (c *Cached3) Sum(data []byte) []byte {
    // Make a copy of the fixed hash:
    d := c.orig
    d.Write(data)
    return d.Sum(c.result[:0])
}

Testing it:
var c3 = NewCached3(fixed)

fmt.Printf(""%x\n"", c3.Sum(variantA))
fmt.Printf(""%x\n"", c3.Sum(variantB))

Output again is the same. So this works too.
Benchmarks
We can benchmark performance with this code:
func BenchmarkCached1(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        c1.Sum(data)
        c1.Sum(data2)
    }
}

func BenchmarkCached2(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        c2.Sum(variantA)
        c2.Sum(variantB)
    }
}

func BenchmarkCached3(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        c3.Sum(variantA)
        c3.Sum(variantB)
    }
}

Benchmark results (go test -bench . -benchmem):
BenchmarkCached1-4   1000000     1569 ns/op     0 B/op    0 allocs/op
BenchmarkCached2-4   2000000      926 ns/op     0 B/op    0 allocs/op
BenchmarkCached3-4   2000000      872 ns/op     0 B/op    0 allocs/op

Cached2 is approximately 41% faster than Cached1 which is quite noticable and nice. Cached3 only gives a ""little"" performance boost compared to Cached2, another 6%. Cached3 is 44% faster than Cached1.
Also note that none of the solutions use any allocations which is also nice.
Conclusion
For that extra 40% or 44%, I would probably not go for the Cached2 or Cached3 solutions. Of course it really depends on how important the performance is to you. If it is important, I think the Cached2 solution presents a fine compromise between minimum added complexity and the noticeable performance gain. It does pose a threat as future Go implementations may break it; if it is a problem, Cached3 solves this by copying the current implementation (and also improves its performance a little).

Django authentication module doesn't store the password in the database as a plain text.   
rather it apply hashing algorithms like 'SHA1' on the password and stores it (as a hash value).
From the hash value you can't get the password as plain text.
You can apply the same hashing algorithm on the given password and check against the stored password.

Linus Torvalds:
A ""old ref"" of all zeroes is considered a ""don't care"" ref, and allows us to say ""write the new ref regardless of what the old ref contained (or even if it existed at all)"".
This allows (if git-send-pack were to do it) creating new refs, and fixing up old ones.


As SzG mentioned in the comments, this is the kind of SHA1 you find in Git receive/update hooks and new branches, representing an ""old-ref"" for a non-existent object (while the ""new-ref"" would create said object, like a branch).

","I do not know if it is possible to handle such a migration with Membership, without forcing users to go through a password reset process.
But you can do that by migrating Membership to Asp.Net Identity at the same time: Asp.Net Identity has extension points allowing you to handle a ""fallback"" password signature match for supporting old signature. At that point, you still have the login and password unhashed in memory, and you can then by the way convert the signature to the new format.
All that is explained with details and code in following blog, including the SQL migration I am only slightly explain in an added comment in below code.
Here is the main class for achieving this:

Then, in your user manager:
public class IdentityUserManager : UserManager<IdentityUser>
{
    public IdentityUserManager(IUserStore<IdentityUser> store)
        : base(store)
    {
        PasswordHasher = new BackCompatPasswordHasher();
    }
}

In my actual code base, I have some additions for handling re-hashing but unfortunately, no comments on why. Maybe that was some superfluous code from original implementer, or it was really needed. I have not investigate it, so here is the additional code in IdentityUserManager:
    private ConcurrentDictionary<string, string> UserRehashed = 
        new ConcurrentDictionary<string, string>();

    private bool CanRehash(IdentityUser user)
    {
        return UserRehashed.TryAdd(user.Id, user.Id);
    }

    protected async override Task<bool> VerifyPasswordAsync(
        IUserPasswordStore<IdentityUser, string> store, IdentityUser user,
        string password)
    {
        var hash = await store.GetPasswordHashAsync(user).ConfigureAwait(false);
        var verifPassRes = PasswordHasher.VerifyHashedPassword(hash, password);
        if (verifPassRes == PasswordVerificationResult.SuccessRehashNeeded &&
            // avoid rehash loop.
            CanRehash(user))
        {

"34928787","Migration from SHA1 to SHA2 ASP.net 4.5, C#","We have one ASP.NET web application which is built in .NET Framework 4.5 version. Currently on production this application is using SHA1 encryption algorithm. This algorithm is set in ""MachineKey"" tag of application's web.config file. This application uses ASP.Net Membership concept for maintaining Login credentials.
As the SHA1 algorithm is on verge of degradation so we want to update our application from SHA1 to SHA2. For this we have set ""HMACSHA256"" in ""MachineKey"" tag of application's web.config file.
After upgrading our application to SHA2 with the above settings, we expect that the older user's passwords (which were encrypted using SHA1 and already present in membership database) will not work with SHA2 algorithm. But it allows older users to login without any modification in previously encrypted password.
Question 1: Are the changes made in ""MachineKey"" tag of application's web.config file enough/recommended for this migration?
Question 2: As we are still able to login into the application using previously encrypted passwords, does the membership database really uses the SHA2 encryption set in web.config file? Or we need to add some additional settings to enable SHA2 encryption on membership database level? Please advice.
Please suggest if there is any best way to enable SHA2 encryption on Membership database level.
","With my other answer technical details, I just realize why you can change hashing algorithm without causing old password to get ""lost"".
Membership does store the hashing algorithm it has used with each password, thus allowing it to still validates old password after a hash algorithm change.
This explains the behavior you have seen. To double check it (and infirms your question 1 & 2 concerns), inspect your data in db, check the PasswordFormat column which should change depending on the used hash algorithm.
You should also check if simply logging in with an old account is enough to have it re-hashed to SHA-2 by Membership. If this is the case, all regular users will be re-hashed quickly after having done the change.
I do not remove my previous answer since it may still be helpful if one considers migrating the authentication framework too.

"3124994","MessageDigest SHA-512 different than openssl","I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong here.  I have the following code:
byte[] digest = new byte[0];
MessageDigest md = null;
try{
    md = MessageDigest.getInstance( ""SHA-512"" );
}
catch( NoSuchAlgorithmException e ) {
    return digest;

digest = md.digest( myString.getBytes() );

Looking at the hex values of digest byte[] in the NetBeans debugger, it shows something different than the output of:
echo ""myString"" | openssl dgst -sha512

I'm guessing it's a character encoding issue, but doesn't the JVM and openssl use the default character set for the machine?
Any help is appreciated.

"7071902","Small differences in SHA1 hashes","A project I am working on uses Apache Shiro as a security framework. Passwords are SHA1 hashed (no salt, no iterations). Login is SSL secured. However, the remaining part of the application is not SSL secured. In this context (no SSL) there should be a form where a user can change the password.
Since it wouldn't be a good idea to transmit it plainly it should be hashed on the client and then transmitted to the server. As the client is GWT (2.3) based, I am trying this library http://code.google.com/p/gwt-crypto, which uses code from bouncycastle.
However, in many cases (not all) the hashes generated by both frameworks differ in 1-4(?) characters.
For instance ""happa3"" is hashed to
""fe7f3cffd8a5f0512a5f1120f1369f48cd6f47c2""

by both implementations, whereas just ""happa"" is hashed to
""fb3c3a741b4e07a87d9cb68f3db020d6fbfed00a""

by the Shiro implementation and to 
""fb3c3a741b4e07a87d9cb63f3db020d6fbfed00a""

by the gwt-crypto implementation (23rd character differs).
I wonder whether there is a ""correct""/standard SHA1 hashing and whether there is a bug in one of the libraries or maybe my usage of them is flawed.
One of my first thoughts was related to different encodings or strange conversions due to different transport mechanisms (RPC vs. Post). To my knowledge though (and what puzzles me most), SHA1 hashes should differ completely with a high probability if there is just a difference of a single bit. So different encodings shouldn't be the issue here.
I am using this code on the client (GWT) for hashing:
String hashed = toHex(createSHA1Hash(""password""));
...
private String createSHA1Hash(String passwordString){
    SHA1Digest sha1 = new SHA1Digest();
    byte[] bytes;
    byte[] result = new byte[sha1.getDigestSize()];
    try {
        bytes = passwordString.getBytes();
        sha1.update(bytes, 0, bytes.length);
        int val = sha1.doFinal(result, 0);
    } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {}
    return new String(result);
}

public String toHex(String arg) {
    return new BigInteger(1, arg.getBytes()).toString(16);
}

And this on the server (Shiro):
 String hashed = new Sha1Hash(""password"").toHex()

which afaics does something very similar behind the scenes (had a quick view on the source code).
Did I miss something obvious here?
EDIT: Seems like the GWT code does not run natively for some reason (i.e. just in development mode) and silently fails (it does compile, though). Have to find out why...
Edit(2): ""int val = sha1.doFinal(result, 0);"" is the line that makes trouble, i.e. if present, the whole code does not run natively (JS) but only in dev-mode (with wrong results)

"49565332","The fingerprint you specified is already used by an Android OAuth2 client ID in this project or another project","I noticed my SHA1 number showing from the gradle view signing report in android studio was different from the one I had originally. I thought maybe it was from changing computers a year ago. My game app was still able to access leaderboards and achievements. I when to my Google API dashboard I noticed the 'OAuth client' had my old SHA1. It wouldn't let me change it to my new SHA1, saying it 'had already been used by this client or another client', although I had no other clients. The mysterious 'Anroid client 1' and 'Android client 2' had neither the old or new SHA1. Underneath the 'OAuth client' was 'OAuth client (auto created by google service)' which had my new SHA1. I went ahead and deleted that one, despite a warning it gave me that it had been used 147 times in the last week (evidence of impending senility on my part I suppose). It seemed I had to delete it to free up the number for my 'OAuth client' that was not auto created. 
Now it appears I'm screwed, as it still gives me 'the already in use message' when I try to change the SHA1, and my game app can no longer access Google Play Services at all. I'm thinking I should have deleted the 'OAuth client' instead. Can I recover from this? Will it free up over time? Another post suggested 7 days for clients to be removed, although I don't see a button to delete the whole client, and am concerned over the deletion of the API codes on the same page.
EDIT 3/30 - It looks like I may have lost this number permanently, although (I'm hoping) it only affects my Leaderboards and Achievements, not Firebase, Inapp Purchasing, or Ads. I can roll my own Leaderboards and Achievements in Firebase anyway. New projects with different package names give me the same unusable SHA1 in the Gradle signingReport.

","I finally got a useful response from Google support through email, providing just a clue on how to start the recovery process:
I understand you're receiving a Client ID error when trying to link your app to a Game Services project. This error message is displayed because your package ID and SHA1 are already in use by another Client ID.

To resolve this issue, please use the steps below to delete the Client ID from your Google Developers Console (formerly Cloud Console).

Important: Do not delete the Google Developers Console project before deleting the Client ID. If you’ve already deleted the project, you will need to undelete it from your Projects list.

1. Use the following URL to access the project - https://console.developers.google.com/project/186639667931
2. Select APIs & auth > Credentials
3. Under “Client ID for Android application” click the “Delete” button.
4. Try linking your app in the Play Console again. If you’re unable to view or undelete the project linked in step 1, please try accessing it while logged in with the primary email address on your Play developer account.

There was no 'Client ID for Android application', but there was an 'OAuth Client' under 'OAuth 2.0 client IDs', so I deleted that. That still had an old SHA1 number as it wouldn't take my current one. So I wasn't really deleting something with my current number, but deleting this deleted the whole client and brought up a blank screen. Here there was a bit of a trap. I added my current SHA1 number to that screen, which it accepted. Now I was able to get a response from the Google Play site again from my app, although its response always was 'Cannot access services'. 
As it turns out, this screen was the default screen, which is 'Google Play Android Developer'. I'll have to research what this is for sometime, but what I needed to add a SHA1 to was my actual app name. I ultimately found buried in the dropdown list at the very top, next to 'Google APIs', among example apps I had downloaded and 'Google Play Android Developer'. I still couldn't add my current SHA1 to it until I went back and deleted the 'OAuth Client' from 'Google Play Android Developer'. This bought the same default screen back, so I went back to the dropdown, selected my app name, and then was able to finally add my current SHA1 back to it.
So deleting a SHA1 appears not to be a permanent exile from Play Services, just the start of a tricky process to get it reestablished.

","How big is your input domain? If it is bigger than your output domain, then the Pigeon Hole principle applies and you can't get unique output by definition.
If the input domain is smaller or equal to the output domain, then you can easily accomplish this with a Pseudo-Random Permutation (PRP) that block ciphers provide.
The output of 16 hexits is equivalent to 8 bytes and equivalent to 64 bit. DES (and Triple DES) is a block cipher that has this block size. 

Parse the input string to a byte array in a compact fashion. If the input always consists of numerical digits, you can use Ebbe M. Pedersen's approach with 
byte[] plaintext = new BigInteger(""0302160123456789"").toByteArray();

Then you can generate some random, but fixed key of 24 bytes for Triple DES and instantiate the cipher with:
Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(""DESede/ECB/PKCS5Padding"");
c.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, new SecretKeySpec(key, ""DESede""));
byte[] ciphertext = c.doFinal(plaintext);

Use some kind of Hex converter to get the representation you want.

You can ""hash"" numbers up to 36028797018963968 with this. If you want larger numbers (up to 9223372036854775808), then you need to use ""DESede/ECB/NoPadding"" and pad yourself with some padding bytes.

","Its very unlikely that a hash collision will happen for sha1.
Probability of sha1 collision is negligible
And hash collision risk is not practical. No one has found sha1 collision till yet . So you are safe to use it. 
Using a salt like microtime or random number may decreases the chances of probability but you simply can't avoid it.
And what you are using is sha1(string) whether string is a mixed value or single string.so using microtime and rand function wont affect anything to probability of hash collision.
Therefore there can be possibility that sha1(mixedvalue) collision might be equal or greater than collision of sha1(filename) so certainly that is of no use.
So dont worry and use this or simple way if you like to, it wont create problem in future, Thinking about hash collision is waste of time when the chances are very very very less.

So, how do you decode the string once you get it encoded? 
","I don't know what you mean by ""unpack"", but you can't get original string from the hash.
Let's understand the problem: you render some hidden fields and you want to make sure that they're submitted unchanged, right? Here's how you can ensure that.
Let's suppose you have two variables:
first: foo
second: bar

You can hash them together with a secret key:
secret_key = ""ysEJbKTuJU6u""
source_string = secret_key + ""first"" + ""foo"" + ""second"" + ""bar""
hash = MD5(source_string)

# => ""1adfda97d28af6535ef7e8fcb921d3f0""    

Now you can render your markup:
<input type=""hidden"" name=""first"" value=""foo"" />
<input type=""hidden"" name=""second"" value=""bar"" />
<input type=""hidden"" name=""hash"" value=""1adfda97d28af6535ef7e8fcb921d3f0"">

Upon form submission, you get values of first and second fields, concat them to your secret key in a similar manner and hash again.
If hashes are equal, your values haven't been changed.
Note: never render secret key to the client. And sort key/value pairs before hashing (to eliminate dependency on order).
( disclaimer: I am not a crypto person, so you may just stop reading now)
As for performance/security, even though MD5 was found to have a weakness, it's still pretty usable, IMHO. SHA1 has a theoretical weakness, although no successful attack has been made yet. There are no known weaknesses in SHA-256.

update
So, how do you decode the string once you get it encoded? 
","For this application, any of the encryption algorithms is fine. You can pack the values any way you want, so long as it's repeatable. One common method is to pack the fields into a string the same way you would encode them into a URL for a GET request (name=value).
To compute the hash, create a text secret that can be whatever you want. It should be at least 12 bytes long though. Compute the hash of the secret concatenated with the packed fields and append that onto the end.
So, say you picked MD5, a secret of JS90320ERHe2 and you have these fields:
first_name = Jack
last_name = Smith
other_field = 7=2

First, URL encode it:
first_name=Jack&last_name=Smith&other_field=7%3d=2

Then compute the MD5 hash of
JS90320ERHe2first_name=Jack&last_name=Smith&other_field=7%3d=2

Which is 6d0fa69703935efaa183be57f81d38ea. The final encoded field is:
first_name=Jack&last_name=Smith&other_field=7%3d=2&hash=6d0fa69703935efaa183be57f81d38ea

So that's what you pass to the user. To validate it, remove the hash from the end, compute the MD5 hash by concatenating what's left with the secret, and if the hashes match, the field hasn't been tampered with.
Nobody can compute their own valid MD5 because they don't know to prefix the string with.
Note that an adversary can re-use any old valid value set. They just can't create their own value set from scratch or modify an existing one and have it test valid. So make sure you include something in the information so you can verify that it is suitable for the purpose it has been used.

So, how do you decode the string once you get it encoded? 
","What you really need is not a plain hash function, but a message authentication code such as HMAC.  Since you say you'd like to use SHA-256, you might like HMAC_SHA256, which is available in Perl via the Digest::SHA module:
use Digest::SHA qw(hmac_sha256_base64);

my $mac = hmac_sha256_base64( $string, $key );

Here, $key is an arbitrary key, which you should keep secret, and $string contains the data you want to sign.  To apply this to a more complex data structure (such as a hash of key–value pairs), you first need to convert it to a string.  There are several ways to do that; for example, you could use Storable:
use Storable qw(freeze);

sub pairs_to_string {
    local $Storable::canonical = 1;
    my %hash = @_;
    return freeze( \%hash );
}

You could also URL-encoding, as suggested by David Schwartz.  The important thing is that, whatever method you use, it should always return the exact same string when given the same hash as input.
Then, before sending the data to the user, you calculate a MAC for them and include it as an extra field in the data.  When you receive the data back, you remove the MAC field (and save its value), recalculate the MAC for the remaining fields and compare it to the value you received.  If they don't match, someone (or something) has tampered with the data.  Like this:
my $key = ""secret"";
sub mac { hmac_sha256_base64( pairs_to_string(@_), $key ) }

# before sending data to client:
my %data = (foo => ""something"", bar => ""whatever"");
$data{mac} = mac( %data );

# after receiving %data back from client:
my $mac = delete $data{mac};
die ""MAC mismatch"" if $mac ne mac( %data );

Note that there are some potential tricks this technique doesn't automatically prevent, such as replay attacks: once you send the data and MAC to the user, they'll learn the MAC corresponding to the particular set of data, and could potentially replace the fields in a later form with values saved from an earlier form.  To protect yourself against such attacks, you should include enough identifying information in the data protected by the MAC to ensure that you can detect any potentially harmful replays.  Ideally, you'd want to include a unique ID in every form and check that no ID is ever submitted twice, but that may not always be practical.  Failing that, it may be a good idea to include a user ID (so that a malicious user can't trick someone else into submitting their data) and a form ID (so that a user can't copy data from one form to another) and perhaps a timestamp and/or a session ID (so that you can reject old data) in the form (and in the MAC calculation).

What am I doing wrong?

Believing that those two properties have meaning :).
The two values you're seeing are hard-coded into RSACryptoServiceProvider.  Other RSA types (such as RSACng) have different, less confusing, hard-coded values.
The problem is that a key doesn't have either of those attributes.  A key can be used for multiple purposes (though NIST recommends against it). A TLS session (or EnvelopedCMS document, etc) can have a key exchange algorithm. A certificate, SignedCMS document, or other such material can have a signature (and thus a signature algorithm).
To know that your certificate was signed with RSA-PKCS1-SHA256 you need to look at X509Certificate2.SignatureAlgorithm.

","Trust your second instinct. Use an existing library made especially for hashing passwords instead of trying to cook up your own.

","If you hash with MD5 first, you will only have the spread of MD5 (128 bit). A large fraction of the space of SHA512 will not be covered by your passwords. So you don't take advantage of SHA512, but it won't be worse than MD5. 
You have the benefit that if someone obtains the SHA512 hash and doesn't know the salt (this you have to enforce somehow) can't look up the hashes and get the passwords -- something that would be possible with the MD5 database you have now.
So yes, you can just rehash the existing MD5 passwords. But as explained in the first paragraph, it would be a bad idea to apply MD5 to all new passwords as well and then hash them as SH512. A easy implementation would be to have a boolean 'salted' field in the database next to the hashes (but don't put the salt there).

","Function composition with cryptographic primitives is dangerous and should not be done if avoidable. The common solution for your type of problem is to keep both hashes for a migration period, using the new hash where possible and transparently upgrading old passwords (when you check a password and it matches, rehash it with the new algorithm and store it)
This won't work if you have a challenge-response based scheme where you don't get to see the plaintext password, but since you seem to have a stored salt that does not change, I assume your application does the hashing.

","If you look at how most Bank and high security people does there password changing. Most of them basically ask people who is using the old encryption method to create a new password. I think you first solution of placing a flag on all existing old MD5 password users, and notify them they need to create new password and slowly migrate them to the new system. That way when you trouble shoot the system if anything goes wrong you won't be asking is this a new user or an old one. Are we double hashing or single? Should never compare two hash as a possible answer because what if MD5('abc') => 123, SHA('NO') => 123, that means someone could have typed in the wrong password but still gets in.

I understand that utilising the birthday problem/pigeon-hold principle, hash collision(s) were found.  http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography%40metzdowd.com/msg02554.html contains an example message.
What I’m having trouble finding/understanding:
Does this mean there is a timely, mathematical way to ALWAYS produce a hash collision? 
Can I eventually find a m2 for a given m1 such that m1 != m2, sha(m1) == sha(m2) or is it only possible on a subset of possible messages?  Rephrased:  Are the chances of my password having another message for a collision guaranteed?  
What is the significance of finding 2 random long messages such as in the link above that have the same hash value?  Why did they have to sift through long random messages for a collision instead of figuring a collision for a practical message like “The brown dog jumped over the fox” ?
A couple examples of hash collisions don’t seem as important as a timely method to generate a collision for any message, but all the posts talk about the former.  
Thanks for any help/your time!  I've read alot of posts/articles, but can't work my brain around my confusion.  I suspect I have the same questions for other broken hash functions like MD5.

The paper (explaining improved method for finding collisions) referenced in the answer
","From Wikipedia:

In February 2005, an attack by Xiaoyun
  Wang, Yiqun Lisa Yin, and Hongbo Yu
  was announced which could find
  collisions in SHA-0 in 2^39
  operations.

That kind of complexity is completely insufficient for cryptographic purposes with the computing power currently available. It guarantees the discovery of a collision for any message in a very reasonable amount of time.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <openssl/sha.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]){

  size_t length = sizeof(data);
  unsigned char hash[50];

  SHA1(data, length, hash);

  printf(""shasum of \""README\"" is \n"");
  for(i = 0; i<SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH; i++){
    printf(""%x"", hash[i]);

  printf(""\n"");

The first hash is from SHA1 and the second hash is from shasum (fork/exec from within program). What is causing this?
","The problem is that the command-line function ""shasum"" takes as an argument a filename, whereas the openssl-library C-function ""shasum"" takes as an argument the actual data. 
That is, you are comparing the result of the hash of the file named README to the result of the hash of the string ""README"".
To see both of calculations result the same, just change:
SHA1(data, length, hash);

to 
SHA1(data, length-1, hash);

As Jonathan Leffler said, this is to correct the fact that you're including the terminating '\0'.
For the other calculation, you could do echo -n README | shasum to see the real hash. Or, to see it result ok in your program, just output it to a file named README: echo -n README > README.
Your program will then output:
shasum of ""README"" is

EDIT:
If you want to use the SHA1 function to calculate the hash of the readme file, you would have to read the file (see You would need to programatically read the file to a char* buffer, ( see Reading the whole text file into a char array in C) and pass this buffer to the SHA1 function.

","I think you convert byte[] to String in wrong way, it should be like this:
hash = new String(data);

Also you are doing the comparison wrong, should be like this:
if(result2.equals(hash))

In my opinion you should not convert byte[] to String at all. Use Arrays.equals(byteArray1,byteArray2);. Your data is random bits of 1 and 0s. Converting it to String can be done in many ways, but it doesn't make any sense.

The problem is how should revert the hash function to get back to the original password? I mean If I would create a login system, I have to be able to get back to the original password or maybe not? Maybe when the password is filled into the form, it has to be converted into hash function and compared to the hash string stored in database, right?
","Brother, the entire purpose of hashes is that you should not be able to get the original string back from them. What you need to do in case of passwords is you hash the user input and compare it with the hash of the password to check if it was the original password. To know how you convert the password into a SHA-256 hash read this.

","First, I would STRONGLY advice against using MySQL's sha() or PHP's sha1() alone for password hashing purposes. This is a huge security risk for your users if your database gets compromised.
Please take the time to read my previous answer on the subject of password hashing to properly secure your data.

Second, your code is vulnerable to an SQL Injection attack. Use mysql_real_escape_string() to escape the variables you are going to put in your query before-hand.
$query2 = ""insert into company(username,password)
  values('"" . mysql_real_escape_string($username) .
          ""', sha1('"" . mysql_real_escape_string($password) . ""'))"";


Third, your $password variable is being overwritten by your databaseconnection.php file.
include(""databaseconnection.php"");
$databaseconnect = connect($host,$user, $password ,$database);

To put emphasis...

$databaseconnect = connect($host,$user,$password,$database);

Therefore, the $password used later on in your query still contains the password for the database connection, not your user's password.
Change the name of your variable in databaseconnection.php or even better still, use an array to hold all the configuration.
$dbConnectParams = array('host' => 'localhost'
                         'user' => 'myUser',
                         'pass' => 'myPassword',
                         'db' => 'myDB');

Then, change your code as follows:
include(""databaseconnection.php"");
$databaseconnect = mysql_connect($dbConnectParams['host'],
                           $dbConnectParams['user'],
                           $dbConnectParams['pass'],
                           $dbConnectParams['db']);

Since you are already passing the database when calling mysql_connect(), you do no need to call mysql_select_db().

"23949502","Wordpress sha 256 login","I've been asked to enable SHA256 for storing wordpress passwords.
I've searched for plugins with no luck (not working), so I started to develop my own.
I first thoug.. well if I replace the wp_hash_password with my own function, It would encrypt when saving password and loging. But I wasn't that lucky. I'm able to run hash(sha256) though in a basic php file. I'm aware that users wont' be able to login as the stored key would be md5 and the comparation would be SHA, but it isn't a problem. 
Code:
 if(!function_exists('wp_hash_password')):
   function wp_hash_password($password){
     return hash('sha256', $password);
   }
endif;

So I guess I'll have to make my own ""check login"" function.
Did someone did something like this?¿
","Seems to me that your approach should work if you override the wp_check_password function as well.  That'll have to be done in a plugin, I think, as the functions are loaded before the theme's functions.php.  Something like this:
<?php
/*
Plugin Name: sh256pass
Version: 1.0
*/

if(!function_exists('wp_hash_password')):
   function wp_hash_password($password){
     return hash('sha256', $password);
   }
endif;


if(!function_exists('wp_check_password')):
    function wp_check_password($password, $hash, $user_id = '') {
        // You might want to apply the check_password filter here 
        return wp_hash_password($password) == $hash;
    }
endif;

Note that you'll either have to have your users reset their password on their next login (you won't be able to convert the existing passwords automatically), or you'll have to follow WordPress's approach in wp_check_password and compare the password to the old encrypted value (in their case md5), and if that matches, update to the new value.
Keep in mind that the wp_users.user_pass field is only 64 characters long.  While that's (just) long enough to store the sha256 value, it isn't long enough to store the sha256 value and a salt.  If you don't salt, and two users choose the same password, the wp_users.user_pass field will contain the same value, making it obvious to anyone with access to the database that the passwords are the same.  My gut feel is that that is a greater security risk than using the current algorithm.  You might be able to get around that by (say) concatenating the user ID and the password before hashing, but there might be edge cases where you don't know the user ID (such as when a user is created).
Personally, I'd question the requirement.

","For printing out hex values, you can use std::hex format; for setting width and fill character, use std::setw and std::setfill, which are part of <iomanip>.
As you do not show the data type of c, I suppose/suggest to use an unsigned integral type, e.g. unsigned char. I slightly adapted the code to make it self contained):

int main() {

The C functions are compiled for Android, using OpenSSL 1.0.1...c as far as I remember. It's definitely 1.0.1 (we are updating it to avoid the Heartbleed issue).
This is what I do... please forgive any mistake as I am learning this by myself.

Generate a private key
openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048

Extract the public key from the private key
openssl rsa -in private.key -out public.key -outform PEM -pubout

Calculate the SHA from a file called permissions and then sign it with the private.key, the output will be a SHA but with RSA encryption (permissions.sign)
openssl dgst -sha256 -sign private.key -out permissions.sign permissions

Validate a received SHA signature against the permissions file (it's successful in the Ubuntu console)
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify public.key -signature permissions.sign permissions

I copy the permissions file, the permissions.sign file and the public.key file to the file system in Android.
I verify that permissions.sign was created with permissions and with a matching private.key... all of this with my public.key (I don't have the private key in Android).

This is the C function.

public_key is a path to public.key
PEM_read_RSA_PUBKEY succeeds
NID_sha256 is what I think I should use for the verification
file is a byte array with the contents of permissions
file_size is the array size of file
sign is a byte array with the contents of permissions.sign
sign_size is the array size of sign
RSA_verify() fails, it returns a 0

So the question is, is it correct to:

generate the keys with the commands I used,
sign the permissions file (which generates permissions.sign),
and then try to verify the files with PEM_read_RSA_PUBKEY() and RSA_verify() ?

Are the commands I used for the signing process equivalent to the C functions I used for the verification process?
Please let me know if more info is required or where I could study more about this.
Thanks!

","There were several missing steps in my reading process for the public key.
The correct commands to generate the private and public keys are as follows:
Generate a private key
 ""openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048""
Extract the public key (DER certificate form) from the private key (needed by RSA_SHA_Verify())
 ""openssl req -outform DER -new -x509 -key private.key -out public.key -days 30000""
Generate a public key with no certificate info (only needed by ""openssl dgst -sha1 -verify ..."")
 ""openssl x509 -inform DER -in public.key -pubkey -noout > public_no_cert.key""
Sign a file with the private key
 ""openssl dgst -sha1 -sign private.key -out permissions.sign permissions""
Verify a file with the public key (no certificate info)
 ""openssl dgst -sha1 -verify public_no_cert.key -signature permissions.sign permissions""
Please refer to the documentation on OpenSSL.org for details. I required a X509 DER certificate that was holding the public key to verify the signed SHA with RSA_verify().
An equivalency in command mode to RSA_verify() is:
openssl dgst -sha1 -verify public.key -signature permissions.sign permissions
For code source, please refer to this link:
http://www.bmt-online.org/geekisms/RSA_verify
It does NOT compile at first sight, you have to tweak it. Call the functions in there as follows:
   result = sign_data(
         input_file_buffer,
         input_file_size,
         private_key_buffer,
         private_key_size,
         (void**)&signature,
         &signature_size);

   result = verify_data(
         input_file_buffer,
         input_file_size,
         signature_buffer,
         signature_size,
         public_key_buffer,
         public_key_size);

Everything has to be in RAM, pass them as pointers.
The signing function expects the pointer to a pointer (**) to save the signed SHA into it. You can later save it into a file.

When looking at YouTube you notice that some movies are uploaded twice or more times (by different users). To scale our application we're thinking about the following idea:

User selects movie file to be uploaded
A JavaScript will get the SHA256 hash from the file (it's more accurate then the MD5 hash) before it get's uploaded
The website will check if the hash already exists
If the hash doesn't exist, the file will be uploaded
If the hash does exist a message will be prompted or a reference to the already existing version on the server will be created. This without the video being uploaded.

Q: How do we analyze a file with JavaScript in order to get the SHA256 hash, and is SHA256 good enough or should we consider SHA512 (or another algorithm)?

I think both Chrome and FireFox supports the reading of files on the client, and IE supports it with the help of ActiveX controls, but to get a solution that works in all browsers you have to use a plugin like Flash or Silverlight. Also, when doing file-uploads of video-magnitude (large+ files), I think going for flash or the likes from the start is a good idea anyhow, but that's just my opinion.

SHA has a variable number of rounds. Two rounds of SHA should be reversible somewhat. I have a vague idea that 20 rounds is considered ""safe"". 30 rounds should be ""highly secure"" and 50 rounds doesn't practically improve at all the security. 
SHA is designed to be secure -- not by hoping that the cracker has a slow enough machine -- but by mathematical proof. If and when the number of irreversible bits in each round is increased and permuted to the 256 bit hash code, there will never be enough computer power to try all possible sequences that generate that particular hash code. Not even enough energy in the universe to wrap a 256-bit counter.

","There are currently three key-derivation functions widely considered to be secure against brute force cracking attempts.  Key-derivation functions are slightly different from regular hashing algorithms in that they are designed to be slow, even in the face of modern GPU-based computation.
I'll list them in order of theoretical security:

PBKDF2 is designed by RSA, based on SHA, and is the algorithm recommended by NIST.  There's a couple implementations that you could use in a browser.
Note to Node users: Node's crypto module has a built-in PBKDF2 function.  Use that.
bcrypt, based on Blowfish, is slightly more secure than PBKDF2.  It has been relatively well-tested and verified secure, but does not have a stamp of approval from any standards bodies, if that's a consideration for you.  There's a generic JS implementation here.
Note to Node users: Use node.bcrypt, which performs the computationally expensive stuff on a separate thread.
Finally, scrypt is far and away the most theoretically secure (slowest) KDF.  Unfortunately, the algorithm is very new, so it has not been validated by rigorous study and testing by the cryptographic community.  It is, however, on track to become a IETF standard.
Because the algorithm is so new, it is hard to find implementations.  I could only find this half-baked one.  While the security benefits are very promising, I would not recommend scrypt until both the algorithm itself and its implementations are verified secure.

How do these three actually compare?  The scrypt paper has a comparison:

Realistically, even PBKDF2 makes it cost-prohibitive for anyone but a government to crack a single 8-character password.

OpenPGP format is likely to be simpler to implement and more readable to the human eye (no ASN.1 to be seen). This might be the best bet for simplicity.

","No; a SHA-1 hash has a size of 160 bits by definition. I strongly doubt that the size of the hash will be a problem; I suppose that you have other data in your database as well? Most likely, you will find that other parts of the data contribute even more to the database size. And how many rows to you expect to have with these hashes?
However, there is a size difference between storing the hash as a string (this will take at least 40 bytes, depending on the string encoding) and storing it as binary data (this will take 20 bytes).
You can switch to another algorithm, as others have noted, but that might not be a good choice from a security perspective - the shorter the output length of a hash algorithm is, the weaker it is.

","Is 20 bytes per hash(assuming binary storage) really too much? If you currently use hex encoding switching to binary saves you 20 bytes per hash. Base64 saves about 10 bytes compared to hex.
If you simply truncate a cryptographic hash it is still a good cryptographic hash, but with a reduced output size. What output size you need depends on your application.
Integrity checks against random changes can use a much shorter hash of 32-64 bits and don't need a cryptographic hash functions.
If you need uniqueness you should have >>2*log_2(entries) bits in your hash (See birthday paradox). At around 120 bits it's similar to a GUID/UUID (There is a sha1 based generation mode for GUIDs)
If you want cryptographic strength I'd avoid going below 128bits.

","It would be helpful if you posted your results that led you to conclude that you're not getting an appropriate distribution, but it's likely one of three things is going on here:

You're simply looking at too small of a sample, and/or you're miss-interpreting your data.  As others have commented, it's completely reasonable for a uniform distribution to not have perfectly uniform output.

(Personally, I think this is most likely) You're over-optimizing your seed generation, and losing data / pigeon holing / otherwise hurting your ability to generate random numbers.  Reading your code, I think you're doing the following:

Generate a uniform random hash of an unknown value
Split the hash into longs and bitwise XOR-ing them together
Setting rand's seed, and generating a random number off that seed

But why are you doing step 2?  What benefit do you think you're getting from that?  Try taking that step out, and just use the first value you extract from the hash as your seed, and see if that doesn't give you better results.  Good rule of thumb with randomness - don't try to outsmart the people who implemented the algorithms, it can't be done :)

"11768809","Randomness of hashing functions such as SHA1","I'm trying to generate an even distribution of random numbers based on User IDs.  That is, I want a random number for each user that remains the same any time that user requests the random number (but the user doesn't need to store the number).  My current algorithm (in PHP) to count distribution, for a given large array of userIDs $arr is:
$range = 100;
$results = array_fill(0, $range, 0);

foreach ($arr as $userID) {
    $hash = sha1($userID,TRUE);
    $data = unpack('L*', $hash);

    foreach ($data as $integer) {
        $seed ^= $integer;

}

One would hope that this generates an approximately even distribution.  But it doesn't!  I've checked to make sure that each value in $arr is unique, but one entry in the list always gets much more activity than all the others.  Is there a better method of generating a hash of a string that will give an approximately even distribution?  Apparently SHA is not up to the job.  I've also tried MD5 and a simple crc32, all with the same results!?
Am I crazy?  Is the only explanation that I have not, in fact, verified that each entry in $arr is unique?
","While all of the answers here are good, I will provide the answer that was correct for me, and that is that I was, indeed, crazy.  Apparently the uniq command does not, in fact, work like I expected it to (data needs to be sorted first).  So the explanation was indeed that the values in $arr were not unique.

"19364232","CryptoJS and PHP SHA256","I would like to get Both CryptoJS's SHA256  and php's Crypt SHA256 output to match.
PHP crypt has a salt and a number of rounds. E.g. for 5000 rounds and salt of ""usesomesillystringforsalt"" it would be;

$hash = crypt('Clear Text String', '$5$rounds=5000$usesomesillystringforsalt$');

I hope im not blind, but i cant find how to reproduce this behaviour in crypto-js. Its syntax doesn't seem to allow for rounds or salt.
Is it possible or should i just resort to using the basic PHP hash instead of crypt? 
","The CryptoJS API doesn't provide a way to specify a salt or the number of rounds for SHA256. You could add a salt manually if necessary, and specifying rounds doesn't make sense since ""plain"" SHA256 always uses a fixed number of rounds (64).
The number of rounds in PHP's crypt() actually defines how often the SHA256 algorithm is applied consecutively, in order to increase the complexity of brute force attacks. The PHP source code comments on this as follows: ""Repeatedly run the collected hash value through SHA256 to burn CPU cycles"".
As you can see in the source code (here and here), crypt() is actually a key derivation function that only makes use of SHA256 to generate cryptographically secure, salted hashes. So it also doesn't simply append the given salt to the key, instead it's a more elaborate process.
Therefore, it is not possible to get the same results with the algorithms provided by CryptoJS.
crypt() is mainly intended for password hashing. So if you need the hashes for another purpose, hash() is a good alternative (and of course creates exactly the same results as CryptoJS.SHA256()).
However, bear in mind that any cryptography with JavaScript is generally considered harmful. Hence, you should better use SSL in your application, if possible, and generate the hashes server side. If this is an option, have a look at bcrypt.

With PostgreSQL 10, you can set password_encryption to scram-sha-256. From the docs

When a password is specified in CREATE ROLE or ALTER ROLE without writing either ENCRYPTED or UNENCRYPTED, this parameter determines whether the password is to be encrypted. The default value is md5, which stores the password as an MD5 hash. Setting this to plain stores it in plaintext. on and off are also accepted, as aliases for md5 and plain, respectively. Setting this parameter to scram-sha-256 will encrypt the password with SCRAM-SHA-256.

See this post for information about iterations using scram-sha-256

"24941614","Multi-user ""provably fair""","""Provably fair"" is an algorithm which allows players of online gambling sites (mostly BTC) to ensure they're always getting a fair shake. You can read more in depth about ""provably fair"" on almost all BTC gambling sites including https://bitzino.com/ or https://primedice.com/.
The algorithm goes something like this:

Generate a random ""secret seed"" to be used for the next 24 hours
Before each bet generate and disclose to the player a ""server seed""
The player then generates a ""client seed"" and places his bet
The server then SHA-2 hashes secret_seed+server_seed+client_seed
The digital signature is then used to determine the outcome of the bet

Some variations forgo altogether the ""secret seed"" in favor of simply hashing the server seed and disclosing only its hash to the player.
While both variations work well, I have taken an interest in creating a ""multi-user"" experience. As it stands, provably fair only works individually. What I would like is a way for two users to both bet on the outcome of a single event. 
For example, if the game is Roulette, I want all users who bet on black for that particular bet to all win, and all those who bet on red to all lose etc.
The naive approach is to have each user contribute a part of the client seed. But this would allow a super-user among the legitimate players to manipulate things. As he would know in advance the outcome of any given client seed he could ensure his piece was contributed last and in such a way as to maximize the house's profit.
Another approach is for the server to generate the outcome, hash it and then disclose this hash to the players before any bets are placed. This forgoes entirely the need for a client seed and would ensure the outcome is not tampered with but would allow the server to manipulate outcomes based on the game (for example, picking 0 or 00 in Roulette) or in easily observed betting patterns. For example, even if the game was something like >50 or <50 on a 1-100 die (where there exists no clear motivation for one outcome over the other) if we see a player betting 1,2,4,8... on "">50"" we can be pretty sure his next bet is going to be 16 on "">50"" and can manipulate things in our favor.
Has something like this ever been implemented before? How might you approach this problem? Is it even possible?
I understand that this question is more conceptual than anything and would kindly ask a moderator to move it if I have posted in the wrong section.
","This might help you. In principle, you need a way to generate a distributed random number between the peers as seed. I.e. you want to avoid anyone choosing a beneficial number. Basically, you could extend the Coin flipping protocol so that everyone generates n numbers and everyone selects one of the n numbers of each other participant at random. Everyone can then prove the correctness of the commonly generated number.

"23163770","Padding the message in SHA256","I am trying to understand SHA256. On the Wikipedia page it says:

append the bit '1' to the message 
append k bits '0', where k is the minimum number >= 0 such that the resulting message
      length (modulo 512 in bits) is 448. 
append length of message (without the '1' bit or padding), in bits, as 64-bit big-endian
  integer
      (this will make the entire post-processed length a multiple of 512 bits)

So if my message is 01100001 01100010 01100011 I would first add a 1 to get
01100001 01100010 01100011 1 
Then you would fill in 0s so that the total length is 448 mod 512:
01100001 01100010 01100011 10000000 0000 ... 0000 
(So in this example, one would add 448 - 25 0s)
My question is: What does the last part mean? I would like to see an example.
","It means the message length, padded to 64 bits, with the bytes appearing in order of significance. So if the message length is 37113, that's 90 f9 in hex; two bytes. There are two basic(*) ways to represent this as a 64-bit integer,
00 00 00 00 00 00 90 f9  # big endian

and
f9 90 00 00 00 00 00 00  # little endian

The former convention follows the way numbers are usually written out in decimal: one hundred and two is written 102, with the most significant part (the ""big end"") being written first, the least significant (""little end"") last. The reason that this is specified explicitly is that both conventions are used in practice; internet protocols use big endian, Intel-compatible processors use little endian, so if they were decimal machines, they'd write one hundred and two as 201.
(*) Actually there are 8! = 40320 ways to represent a 64-bit integer if 8-bit bytes are the smallest units to be permuted, but two are in actual use.

Usage:
List<Byte[]> hashes = ComputeHashes();
hashes.Sort(NativeMethods.CompareSequences);

This is what it does:

Null arrays are placed at the bottom of the list.
Non-null arrays are sorted by length, then by ""content"":


In presence of mismatching lengths, bigger arrays prevail.
In presence of identical lengths, the array whose first mismatching byte is greater prevails.


Since you are working with hashes, there should be no null values and all the arrays in your list are supposed to have the same length. Hence, the comparison function could be simplified as follows:
internal static Int32 CompareSequences(Byte[] array1, Byte[] array2)
{
    unsafe
    {
        fixed (Byte* pointer1 = array1, pointer2 = array2)
            return -Math.Min(Math.Max(memcmp((IntPtr)pointer1, (IntPtr)pointer2, (UIntPtr)array1.Length), -1), 1);
    }
}

","First of all, it is unlikely that you can compress a good hash in the normal sense.  Compression is about a reversible encoding that reduces redundancy.  In a good hash there should be no redundancy to reduce, and hence compression will be ineffective.

Since SHA-256 is 32 bytes long (256 bits), and I need it to fit into the serialVersionUID (64 bits), how might I convert it to a 64 bit value and minimize the loss of the characteristics of a good hash?

So what are those good characteristics?  Well the primary characteristic of a good hash is that it is impractical to reverse it; i.e. it is impractical to work out a possible input that resulted in the hash.  And a related characteristic is that given a known input that produces a given hash, it is impractical to produce another input (i.e. a collision) that gives the same hash.
Now when you go from a 256 bit to a 64 bit hash, you make it a whole lot easier to reverse a hash or produce a collision for a hash ... by brute-force.  Basically, an 64 bit hash means there is one chance in 2^64 that any random input will have a given hash.   That probability is large enough that some ""bad guy"" with enough cores has a good enough chance of success (in a reasonable time) to make brute-force a reasonable option.
But does it really matter?  What would someone achieve by creating a serialVersion String that collides?  These strings are not secret, and they don't tell you anything definitive about the API of the object ...
The bottom line is that if these reduced hashes are being used as serialVersion strings are designed to be used, then there won't be any problem in (for example) just using the first 64 bits of the SHA-256 hash.  There is no need to XOR or checksum or do any other more complicated transformation.

","SHA instructions are now available in Goldmont architecture. It was released around September, 2016. According to the Intel Intrinsics Guide, these are the intrinsics of interest:

__m128i _mm_sha1msg1_epu32 (__m128i a, __m128i b)
__m128i _mm_sha1msg2_epu32 (__m128i a, __m128i b)

__m128i _mm_sha256rnds2_epu32 (__m128i a, __m128i b, __m128i k)

GCC 5.0 and above make intrinsics available all the time for Function Specific Option Pragmas. You will need Binutils 2.24, however. Testing also shows Clang 3.7 and 3.8 support the intrinsics. Testing also shows Visual Studio 2015 can consume them, but VS2013 failed to compile them.
You can detect the availability of SHA in the preprocessor on Linux by looking for the macro __SHA__. -march=native will make it available if its native to the processor. If not, you can enable it with -msha.
$ gcc -march=native -dM -E - </dev/null | egrep -i '(aes|rdrnd|rdseed|sha)'

The code for using SHA1 is shown below. Its based on Intel's blog titled Intel® SHA Extensions. Another reference implementation is available from the miTLS project.

The code below is based on Intel® SHA Extensions blog. The code works with full SHA1 blocks, so const uint32_t *data is 64 bytes. You will have to add the padding for the final block and set the bit length.
It runs at about 1.7 cycles-per-byte (cpb) on an Celeron J3455. I believe Andy Polyakov has SHA1 running around 1.5 cpb for OpenSSL. For reference, an optimized C/C++ implementation will run somewhere around 9 to 10 cpb.

I am using physical device (LG P990, 2.2.2). Can I get better results with Java, or I have to look into JNI implementation?
I have played with buffer size - no significant difference.
Traceview results
So it seems the bottleneck is in updating hash.

Research
That is interesting. When I have tried on 2.3.2 (SE Xperia), processing speed was about 12meg/sec. When I've tried on 2.2 (HTC Legend), the speed was even slower than at first device. Could it be so that something has been changed since 2.3?
","According to my benchmarks, that code should easily be able to perform way better than 120 kb/s (I'm running on different hardware, but still).
If you profile the code with Traceview, where is the time spent? If the bottleneck is FileInputStream.read(), think about:

if some other app is using the sdcard at the same time as you, like a media indexing app or something. Sharing bandwidth with some other app will have an adverse effect on the sdcard reading performance of your app.
If the sdcard itself is the problem. Try another sdcard or re-format the one you have.

If the bottleneck is MessageDigest.update() (which I doubt), I guess you do need to look into a JNI solution. For your information, the SHA-1 implementation already is in native code (see android_message_digest_sha1.cpp), but maybe you can gain a speedup by avoiding some native <-> Java copying.
Update 1 (Please ignore):
(Based on your profiling, the problem seems to be that you don't use Android's optimized android.security.MessageDigest but instead java.security.MessageDigest. Try android.security.MessageDigest instead. Both Android 2.2 and 2.3 have native SHA-1 implementations of android.security.MessageDigest.)
Update 2:
Sorry, I forgot about android.security.MessageDigest being internal. I now realize that I was also using java.security.MessageDigest in my benchmarking. I was running on Android 2.3 though, and it turns out the SHA-1 implementation of java.security.MessageDigest in Android 2.3 is in native code as well, while that appearently is not the case on Android 2.2.
So the answer to your original question is: Yes, it is painfully slow in Android 2.2 due to a Java implementation but significantly faster in Android 2.3 due to an implementation in native code. You should see similar speedups on Android 2.2 if you use your own SHA-1 implementation in native code.

SHA-256 operates with block sizes of 64 bytes (=512bits). This means smaller inputs must be padded first. The result of the padding looks like this:

For Bits 01:  0110000000000...00000000010

The problem you were having was that the hash of the binary string and the hash of its hexadecimal ASCII representation are two different hashs.

        dis = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
        dos = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());

        writeString(ip);
        dos.writeInt(port);
        if (dis.readByte() != 0xFD)
            return false;
        String serverId = readString();
        byte[] publicKey = new byte[dis.readShort()];
        for (int i = 0; i < publicKey.length; i++)
            publicKey[i] = dis.readByte();
        byte[] token = new byte[dis.readShort()];
        for (int i = 0; i < token.length; i++)
            token[i] = dis.readByte();
        PublicKey serverPublicKey = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"").generatePublic(new X509EncodedKeySpec(publicKey));
        byte[] sharedSecret = new byte[16];
        new Random().nextBytes(sharedSecret);
        URL url = new URL(""http://session.minecraft.net/game/joinserver.jsp?user="" + username + ""&sessionId="" + session + ""&serverId="" + serverId);

","Are you sure this is not intended behaviour? Does it return the same hash if you pass the same value? IF yes, then you've achieved your purpose. You've got a one way hashed string of the username and password.
comparing
so you retrieve the has from database and store the hash from the table
get the userid and password from database and compute the hash
So basically, when the user types in his username, you fetch his userid from database
Calculate the has from the provided password 
and you've got the two hashes.
databasehash=gethashfromdatabase(user_id)
receviedhash=computehash(user_id,password)

now, you can compare the two.

","When you deal with strong encryption, strong hashes (such as SHA1) it is critical that you understand that all of them are defined to work on strings of octets, which are usually arrays of unsigned characters. They are not ""strings"" as used by popular programming languages.
What you are seeing, ""5C6BED..."" is simply a hexadecimal encoding of the octets. Just call that a string, and store it, and then retrieve it, and convert back to the raw value for processing.

The dynamic salt does NOT match while the static salt DOES match.

My MySQL version is 5.5.29
","It's because of the default character set of your table. You appear to be running this on a UTF8 database and something in SHA1() is having problems with the differing character sets.
If you change your table declaration to the following it will match again:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `users` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `identity` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `credential` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `credentialSalt` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)

SQL Fiddle
As robertklep commented explicitly casting your string to a character will also work, basically ensure you're using the same characterset when doing comparisons using SHA1()
As the encryption functions documentation says:

Many encryption and compression functions return strings for which the result might contain arbitrary byte values. If you want to store these results, use a column with a VARBINARY or BLOB binary string data type. This will avoid potential problems with trailing space removal or character set conversion that would change data values, such as may occur if you use a nonbinary string data type (CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT).

This was changed in version 5.5.3:

As of MySQL 5.5.3, the return value is a nonbinary string in the connection character set. Before 5.5.3, the return value is a binary string; see the notes at the beginning of this section about using the value as a nonbinary string.

But is there a way to pass to it a file stream when the file is for example 10GB in size ?
","That exact code can't take a stream, no.
Look at the loop while (currentBlock <= endOfFullBlocks). It runs 64 bytes at a time through the actual hashing code. So in order to modify this code to take a stream, you need it to read those 64 bytes from the stream rather than taking them from sarray (which points to the same data as the input src).
64 bytes per read is not an efficient way to read 10GB of data, so actually you might like to introduce a second loop: one to read larger chunks from the file and one to put 64 byte blocks of that through the hash.
You will of course also need to modify the code to handle the ""leftover"" part of the input data that's not a multiple of 64.
Alternatively, find a different SHA1 implementation with ""init"", ""update"", ""finish""/""digest"" functions, and use that instead. The idea of such interfaces is that you call ""update"" as many times as you like, passing in chunks of data of whatever size is convenient for reading your stream.

","If at all possible, pull something off the shelf. You do not want to roll your own SHA-256 implementation because to get official blessing, you would have to have it certified.
That said, the specification is

5.1.1 SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256
Suppose that the length of the message, M, is l bits. Append the bit 1 to the end of the message, followed by k zero bits, where k is the smallest, non-negative solution to the equation
l + 1 + k ≡ 448 mod 512
Then append the 64-bit block that is equal to the number l expressed using a binary representation. For example, the (8-bit ASCII) message “abc” has length 8 × 3 = 24, so the message is padded with a one bit, then 448 - (24 + 1) = 423 zero bits, and then the message length, to become the 512-bit padded message
                                  423       64
                                 .-^-.  .---^---.
01100001  01100010  01100011  1  00…00  00…011000
   “a”       “b”       “c”                  '-v-'
                                             l=24

Then length of the padded message should now be a multiple of 512 bits.

You might be tempted to use vec because it allows you to address single bits, but you would have to work around funky addressing.

If bits is 4 or less, the string is broken into bytes, then the bits of each byte are broken into 8/BITS groups. Bits of a byte are numbered in a little-endian-ish way, as in 0x01, 0x02, 0x04, 0x08, 0x10, 0x20, 0x40, 0x80. For example, breaking the single input byte chr(0x36) into two groups gives a list (0x6, 0x3); breaking it into 4 groups gives (0x2, 0x1, 0x3, 0x0).

Instead, a pack template of B* specifies

A bit string (descending bit order inside each byte).

and N

An unsigned long (32-bit) in ""network"" (big-endian) order.

The latter is useful for assembling the message length. Although pack has a Q parameter for quad, the result is in the native order.
Start with a bit of prep work
our($UPPER32BITS,$LOWER32BITS);
BEGIN {
  use Config;
  die ""$0: $^X not configured for 64-bit ints""
    unless $Config{use64bitint};

  # create non-portable 64-bit masks as constants
  no warnings ""portable"";
  *UPPER32BITS = \0xffff_ffff_0000_0000;
  *LOWER32BITS = \0x0000_0000_ffff_ffff;
}

Then you can defined pad_message as
sub pad_message {
  use bytes;

  my($msg) = @_;
  my $l = bytes::length($msg) * 8;
  my $extra = $l % 512;  # pad to 512-bit boundary
  my $k = 448 - ($extra + 1);

  # append 1 bit followed by $k zero bits
  $msg .= pack ""B*"", 1 . 0 x $k;

  # add big-endian length
  $msg .= pack ""NN"", (($l & $UPPER32BITS) >> 32), ($l & $LOWER32BITS);

  die ""$0: bad length: "", bytes::length $msg
    if (bytes::length($msg) * 8) % 512;

  $msg;
}

Say the code prints the padded message with
my $padded = pad_message ""abc"";

# break into multiple lines for readability
for (unpack(""H*"", $padded) =~ /(.{64})/g) {
  print $_, ""\n"";
}

Then the output is
6162638000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

You add the salt to the password hash when you register, but you don't add it when you attempt a login.
I also want to strongly urge you not to POST directly into your database queries, but to use the mysql_real_escape for every POST variable that is used in a query. Better still would be to use prepared statements.
Doest that help at all?

","Despite we can't see your code. There are two possible ways to fix this. 
Workaround: Add the following dependencies
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
        <artifactId>bcpkix-jdk15on</artifactId>
        <version>1.52</version>

        <artifactId>bcprov-jdk15</artifactId>
        <version>1.46</version>
    </dependency>

And add this instruction Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider()) before authenticating with MongoDB.
Correct way:
Since, PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 should be included in your java installation folder. In my opinion, i would check if my enviorment variables are correct. And in the case that you use Windows, i would also check regedit HKLM/Software/JavaSoft/Java Runtime Environment/ to make sure that paths are also correct.

"17003134","php's hmac sha256 implementation mismatches java's one","i'm trying to reproduce in php the test cases mentioned in the official of totp computation reference (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238 Appendix A) which are written in java. The reference provides example for sha1, sha256 and sha512 algorithm.  
I've found this nice example by Rob Swan (see the 8 digit example) that reproduces fine one test case (with sha1). But if I change the algorithm to sha256 or sha512 (and change the seeds too, according to the reference input data) I got different results from the reference's ones. 
May the hmac hash function of php be different from java's one? 
Thank you!
","* SOLUTION 
Here is a copy of the php implementation by Rob Swan I mentioned:
<?php

// Define your secret seed
// NB: this is a hexadecimal representation of the example
// ASCII string which is: 12345678901234567890
$secret_seed = ""3132333435363738393031323334353637383930"";

// Determine the time window as 30 seconds
$time_window = 30;

// Set the timestamp manually
$exact_time = 1111111109;

// Round the time down to the time window
$rounded_time = floor($exact_time/$time_window);

// Pack the counter into binary
$packed_time = pack(""N"", $rounded_time);

// Make sure the packed time is 8 characters long
$padded_packed_time = str_pad($packed_time,8, chr(0), STR_PAD_LEFT);

// Pack the secret seed into a binary string
$packed_secret_seed = pack(""H*"", $secret_seed);

// Generate the hash using the SHA1 algorithm
$hash = hash_hmac ('sha1', $padded_packed_time, $packed_secret_seed, true);

// NB: Note we have change the exponent in the pow function 
// from 6 to 8 to generate an 8 digit OTP not a 6 digit one 

// Extract the 8 digit number fromt the hash as per RFC 6238
$offset = ord($hash[19]) & 0xf;
$otp = (
    ((ord($hash[$offset+0]) & 0x7f) << 24 ) |
    ((ord($hash[$offset+1]) & 0xff) << 16 ) |
    ((ord($hash[$offset+2]) & 0xff) << 8 ) |
    (ord($hash[$offset+3]) & 0xff)
) % pow(10, 8);

// NB: Note that we are padding to 8 characters not 6 for this example

// Add any missing zeros to the left of the numerical output
$otp = str_pad($otp, 8, ""0"", STR_PAD_LEFT);

// Display the output, which should be 
echo ""This should display 07081804: "" . $otp;

?>

The key point is this line: 
$offset = ord($hash[19]) & 0xf;

This works fine under the hypotesis of using sha1 algorithm, which returns a 20 chars string. 
To abstract the line and make it compatible with any other algorithm change this line to:
$offset = ord($hash[strlen($hash)-1]) & 0xf;

Now you have a general and working php version of RFC 6238 totp calculation!

","Verifying the integrity of your app won't be enough, since the request can be easily faked outside the app or modified in memory on the fly, using a rooted android environment. Even more, you cannot totally avoid it.
This is a problem shared by all applications running in a machine out of your control (all client applications). You can't never trust the data coming from them.
As I can see it, you have several choices:

Obfuscate the code and make the app more difficult to be reverse-engineered. Notice that this do not solve the problem, but minimizes it.
Move processing to the server. The more game-play is controlled by the server, the less vulnerable you app would be to this malicious behavior.
Automatically detect impossible scores and close their accounts

","If you want to verify the signature of your app without the possibility that this is cracked too, you would have to upload the whole apk and make the check on a server. This is not a practicable solution.
The only secure android app is a pure terminal app, which means you'd have to do all computing on a server. Most of the time this won't be possible because of latency.
That's why we Android developers have to live with this: an app is not 100% secure.
But you can get close to it. 
You might want to read Security with HTTPS and SSL guide for securing your communication.
Also you'll want to ensure your client is hard to crack: android app piracy prevention and Combating Android App Piracy: Xposed
In your case you'll also want to implement server-side request validation:
If you have a game with a server side, users probably have an account. If a user sends a clearly impossible score, automatically disregard the request and ban the user (and his ip). (But also have in mind that this should never happen to a valid request, otherwise users might get angry and stop playing.)

","First of all, you really have to obfuscate your code. You can find more information about ProGuard and code obfuscation here.
Second of all, you can use GoogleAuthUtil available in Google Play Services, which is available for devices running Android 2.2 or higher.
GoogleAuthUtil does exactly what you need: 

Your client server calls go to Google via a HTTPS request, Google checks whether or not the call is made by an app signed with your release certificate, and then it sends the request to your server.
You can find official tutorials about how to implement this here and official documentation here.

","1) Use code obfuscation for ex. Proguard. This kind of tools available not only for Java.
But be careful with that - obfuscated code may work slowly or contain additional bugs.
2) Add App Licencing check (this will check app signature with Google Play):
Watch this video with attention:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnSNCXR9fbY
As I remember he mention technics  used at runtime to verify your app not hacked or modified (zip check, etc). 
3) Make sure your app/server use secure connection (SSL/TLS) only with MODERN cipher suites. This will mitigate downgrade attacks.
You can use this generator to build config with MODERN cipher suites for your server:
https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/
Also you can use certificate pining on client side - this will mitigate authority attack.
Do not use plain HTTP connection.
4) Use some kind of request signing (like Amazon AWS does)
You can get core idea from their docs.
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4_signing.html
Also this article should be helpful.
5) Prohibit usage of your app on ROOT'ed devices by adding run time check. Because of on rooted phone it's easier to hack or analyze your app.
6) You can decrease fraud by adding some ban system to your online game - if somebody hack your app and send wrong data to your server => add this user to ban list on server side (by IP or by user ID, etc). Probably add users to this list temporary (ex 24 hr, 7 days)
7) + if you are using Json/XML as data formats for network layer try to use binary format like Protocol Buffers. Binary serialization formats more efficient and hard to reverse engineer.

","You can obfuscate your code better and use some very obfuscated secret to sign your requests. With that you can increase security.
But if all your game run in client it can't be completely secure. Because it doesn't matter what you use to sign, if you do it in client it means you have the secret or private key in client and then it can be hacked.
To make it more secure you need to involve some game logic in server and then control in that logic that the user isn't cheating.

Function ___report_rangecheckfailure was introduced in more recent versions of Visual Studio (see http://blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust/2012/01/26/enhancements-to-gs-in-visual-studio-11/ for details).
So the linker is looking in the VS2010 libraries to find a function that didn't exist until later.
The maintainer of at least one of the pre-built OpenSSL libraries for Windows has recently switched from using an earlier version of Visual Studio, which may be the trigger for your problems.

This is very different from your Java code, which passes the bytes that come out of the first hash directly to the second one, without printing them as hex and turning those characters back into bytes in between.  The single byte with value 254 (decimal) becomes ""fe"" in hex, which becomes the two-byte sequence [0x66, 0x65] when converted back to bytes.

","Your hash is working fine. The problem is that the online calculators that you're using are treating your input:
9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08

as a string instead of an array of bytes. In other words, it's treating each character as a byte instead of parsing character pairs as bytes in hexadecimal. If I give this as a string to online calculators, I indeed get exactly what you got:
4efc1c36d3349189fb3486d2914f56e05d3e66f8

However, you're treating the output as an array of bytes instead of a String and that's giving you different results. You should encode your raw SHA256 hash as a string, then pass the encoded string to the hash function. I see you have a getHexString method, so we'll just use that.
public static String toRIPEMD160(String in) {
    try {
        byte[] addr = in.getBytes();
        byte[] out = new byte[20];
        RIPEMD160Digest digest = new RIPEMD160Digest();

        // These are the lines that changed
        byte[] rawSha256 = sha256(addr);
        String encodedSha256 = getHexString(rawSha256);
        byte[] strBytes = encodedSha256.getBytes(""UTF-8"");
        digest.update(strBytes, 0, strBytes.length);

        digest.doFinal(out, 0);
        return getHexString(out);
    } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException ex) {
        // Never happens, everything supports UTF-8
        return null;
    }
}

If you want to know it's working, take the value of encodedSha256 and put that into an online hash calculator. As long as the calculator uses UTF-8 encoding to turn the string into a byte array, it will match your output.

What would be an appropriate solution for that issue? Maybe I've missed some library that implements such functionality?
","PHP's openssl_ currently supports ECDSA only with SHA1 digest (reefer to openssl_get_md_methods() output, position [14]). You'll need a workaround for this. From comments of this question (closed as off topic, by the way), but it was focused on bitcoin implementations.

NOTE: The concern here is not malicious attacks, but to ensure the best possible protection against random bit flips.
","Any hash that satisfies the strict avalanche criterion (that is, if any bit is flipped in the input, every bit in the output will be flipped with a probability of 50%) may be used in this way, and that includes every cryptographic hash in common use, including SHA512. There are security implications to using very short hashes, but if they really aren't relevant, as you claim, you're free to select the fastest hash available (probably MD5).
Since short hashes will be particularly vulnerable to the birthday paradox, though, consider using longer hashes anyway. If you're generating so many hashes that 16 bits versus 256 bits is significant, you will run into duplicates even without malicious attackers.

","What you're describing is evaluating hash function's 'avalanche property';  if you change the input just a little bit, how much does the output change?  Any decent hashing function should be able to completely mangle the result drastically even if the input changes just one bit.  This is why things like salts and nonces work well, because adding few bytes to the initial string (which by itself might be weak, short or predictable, like passwords), changes the result of the hash to something completely different and unrelated to the original.

  SHA-512, and 41 out of 64 rounds of
  SHA-256.[1] Collision attacks against

and

There are two meet-in-the-middle preimage attacks against SHA-2 with a reduced number of rounds. The first one attacks 41-round SHA-256 out of 64 rounds with time complexity of 2253.5 and space complexity of 216, and 46-round SHA-512 out of 80 rounds with time 2511.5 and space 23. The second one attacks 42-round SHA-256 with time complexity of 2251.7 and space complexity of 212, and 42-round SHA-512 with time 2502 and space 222.

So yes, it's weakened, but it's nowhere near useless yet.  And I haven't found any attacks specific to dealing with input length extension.

","Some more details could be useful, but I think the answer is that you should be okay.
You didn't say how the SHA-1 hash was encoded (common possibilities include ""none"" (the raw bytes), Base64 and hex). Since SHA-1 produces a 20 byte (160 bit) hash, I am guessing that it will be encoded using hex, since that doubles the space needed to the 40 bytes you mentioned. With that encoding, 2 characters will be used to encode each byte from the hash, using the symbols 0 through 9 and A through F. Those are all ASCII characters so you are safe.
Base64 encoding would also work (though probably not what you asked about since it increases the size by about 1/3 leaving you at well less than 40 bytes) as each of the characters used in Base64 are also ASCII.
If the raw bytes were used directly, you would have a problem, as some of the values are not valid characters.

This wolution works for ApacheDirectory servers (for org.apache implementation classes, but I think you can find interceptors for each openldap).
If you want use SHA encrypting by default when using ldappasswd you can change the interceptor implementation of password.
You have to modify following dn entry:

ads-interceptorId=passwordHashingInterceptor,ou=interceptors,ads-directoryServiceId=default,ou=config

And change the value:
ads-interceptorclassname: arg.apache.directory.server.core.hash.ShaPasswordHashingInterceptor
By default, openldap is using:

ads-interceptorclassname: org.apache.directory.server.core.hash.SshaPasswordHashingInterceptor

Command to modify:

ldapmodify -h <LDAP_HOST> -p <LDAP_PORT> -D ""<ADMIN_DN>"" -w ""<ADMIN_PASSWORD>"" <<EOF
dn: ads-interceptorId=passwordHashingInterceptor,ou=interceptors,ads-directoryServiceId=default,ou=config
changetype: modify
replace: ads-interceptorclassname
ads-interceptorclassname: org.apache.directory.server.core.hash.ShaPasswordHashingInterceptor
EOF

Then you have to restart your LDAP server. All new passwords added by ldappasswd will be in SHA and not in SSHA.
Note:
You can use another interceptor provided by Apache:

","
one: do not do. It better to distribute DCrypt library with ur component and allow user to update it to more recent versions.
If sha256 would turn buggy, or incompatible with newer Delphi version - what would you do ? If u use DCrypt, then you just download new version of it. If you isolated it - then u have to fix it yourself. Do you have enough skils in both Delphi and crypto mathematics, to always doo all fixes of sha256 code and new Delphi versions in future ?
But if you insist - then launch to Delphi side by side. In one open DCrypt sources, in another open new empty unit. Copy sha256-generating procedure from DCrypt to empty unit and try to compile. Delphi would tell you of unknown identificators. Look into Dcrypt Delphi and find the declarations of them. If they are from DCpypt too - then copy them again into the new unit. If they are from RTL/VCL - add the unit into USES of your new unit. And try to compile again. Repeat this until all the identifiers are either resolved by USES or copied from DCrypt into your file.
After it compiles - take some file and calculate hashes by DCrypt and by you new library - if they are different, that means you had borken something and have to find and fix it (you have enought crypto math experience, don't you).

I made Win64 asm optimizations for Spring4D sha code and all that code was covered by unit tests, so i always new if my optimizations broke things or not. Without those total testign policy i'd not be able to do it.
I strongly advice you to stick with DCrypt or Lockbox3 or Spring4D or any other strong living library and not isolate yourself. Keep together with community and you can use their labor for yourself. Isolate - and you would have to re-do it each time new bug or incompatibility would face up.
You cannot extract code from library - why do you think you would be able to upgrade that code to XE4/5/6... and prove it was not broken ?

"34979463","Windows 10 ignores Authenticode on my setups files","Being on the ""Fast Ring"" of Windows 10, I got a strange behaviour on my own setup executables:
I'm SHA-1 signing them with Authenticode since years the same way and never had any problems. 
Recently Windows 10 does not recognize my (valid) signatures.
When downloading a setup.exe from my website and executing it, the Windows SmartScreen message box appears and tells me:

...
  Publisher: unknown
  ...

When viewing the properties of the just downloaded setup executable, it shows the signature, and tells me that the signature is valid.
In addition, the whole certificate chain is valid.
I'm signing it with something like this:
SignTool.exe sign /v /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll 
    /f ""my-authenticode.pfx"" /p ""my-password"" ""my-setup.exe""

(Line-breaks added for readability)
My question:
Is anyone aware of a possible reason (and fix) for this?
More Information:
I can think of possible reasons:

Signing with Windows 10 Fast Ring is buggy. (I've signed on Windows Server 2008 R2 with the same behaviour).
Running the downloaded setup executable within Windows 10 Fast Ring is buggy.

Update 1:
I've found a MSDN blog article back from 2013 that seems to talk about something similar as I discover, but I still cannot see whether this really applies.
More strange: Older downloads from our website, signed with the same Authenticode certificate do not trigger the warning.
Maybe SmartScreen compares the timestamp and behaves differently for newer signatures/setup executables?
Maybe I would need to add additional/different parameters when calling SignTool.exe?
Update 2:
On a non-Fast Ring Windows 10, the SmartScreen warning is not displayed.
In addition, there is also a similar SO posting which didn't help me further.
Plus, there is a Symantec posting, that claims:

For Windows Vista 64-bit and Windows 7 the signing process has changed. The code cannot simply be signed, it also needs to be ""cross-signed"" with a certificate provided by Microsoft.

This is strange to me since my signing procedure worked successfully until recently.
They further link to their own instructions which talk about kernel mode software only.
Update 3:
User GSerg pointed me to ""Windows Enforcement of Authenticode Code Signing and Timestamping"" on Microsoft TechNet.
This seems to go into the right direction.
I've seen that my current certificate is SHA-1. I've just updated it to SHA-2/SHA-256 by re-issuing it from Thawte.
Now, I still get a SmartScreen warning on my local Windows 10 Fast Ring PC but at least it now prints the publisher.

I'll no purchase a code signing cert from DigiCert since I believe that the certificate chain also has influence on how the SmartScreen filter sees my application. I do hope it is an improvement compared to the Thawte certificate I'm currently using.
If you plan to sign for Windows Vista, please note that there was a problem with SHA-256 signed files. The linked TechNet article talks about dual signing to overcome this.
Update 4:
See also this SO answer that deals about passing the SmartScreen warning with signed applications.
If this DigiCert certificate plus waiting to get enough reputation still does not help, I'll probably have to swallow the bitter pill and buy an extended validation (EV) code signing certificate (which requires a hardware token and is more expensive).
Update 5:
After approx. one day, SmartScreen seems to not show any warnings anymore.
Seems that my now dual-signed setup executables (SHA-1 plus SHA-256) already got enough reputation to successfully pass the SmartScreen tests.

My certification path/chain now looks like this:

What looks a bit strange to me is that the root certificate ""thawte"" still uses SHA-1. 
I would have expected that this still causes SmartScreen worries, but it seems it doesn't.
Update 6:
The article ""Do You Need SHA-2 Signed Root Certificates?"" explains why you do not need a SHA-256 root certificate.
In the meantime I've also received my Authenticode certificate from DigiCert. I'm using it in some setups already.
It only took about one single day until the SmartScreen filter did pick it up and not warn about it anymore.
So I'm now having a Thawte Authenticode code signing certificate and a DigiCert Authenticode code signing certificate.
If I understood the SHA-256 implications earlier, I could have saved the money for the DigiCert certificate.
","As user GSerg pointed out, the reason for the error in my initial question was that I'm using SHA-1 only which is ""deprecated"" by Microsoft since 2016.
After dual-signing my setup executable both with SHA-1 and SHA-256 (and waiting some days), the SmartScreen filter does not complain anymore.

Is there a way to store the 64 bytes string in 32 bytes so that it can be compared?
","Characters are often stored in ASCII, so start by having a look at an ASCII chart. This will show you the relationship between a character like 'a' and the number 97.
You will note all of the numbers are right next to each other. This is why you often see people do c-'0' or c-48 since it will convert the ASCII-encoded digits into numbers you can use.
However you will note that the letters and the numbers are far away from each other, which is slightly less convenient. If you arrange them by bits, you may notice a pattern: Bit 6 (&64) is set for letters, but unset for digits. Observing that, converting hex-ASCII into numbers is straightforward:
int h2i(char c){return (9*!!(c&64))+(c&15);}

Once you have converted a single character, converting a string is also straightforward:
void hs(char*d,char*s){while(*s){*d=(h2i(*s)*16)+h2i(s[1]);s+=2;++d;}}

Adding support for non-hex characters embedded (like whitespace) is a useful exercise you can do to convince yourself you understand what is going on.

The approach here is to call sscanf repeatedly with the ""%2"" SCNx8 format specifier, which means ""two hex characters converted to uint8_t"". The position is determined by the index of the loop iteration, i.e. shaStr+2*i

","A cryptographically secure hashing function is a function such that a given arbitrary length input is processed into a fixed length output in such a way that is not reversible (computationally infeasible). Such functions include MD5 and the SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) family (1, 224, 256, 384, 512, etc).
Once you take the hash of the input there is no going back to the original input. This property can be used for verification of message integrity as hashing the identical message produces a identical hash.
The website you visited simply stores hashes and their inputs side by side and does a database lookup for your hash to attempt to find a possible input (if it was previously added to the database).

"21579634","Store SHA1 hash digest of a FreeRADIUS user password in PostgreSQL","I have a system with a centralized user database where usernames and passwords are stored for different application.
The database is created in PostgreSQL. FreeRDAIUS gets access to the users and passwords via OpenLDAP which uses PostgreSQL as a backend system. The passwords are supposed to be stored in their hash formats.
I have tested FreeRADIUS with SHA1 passwords stored in the database and users are successfully authenticated. I stored the digest with {SHA} prepnded to it and it work perfectly. This hash, however, needs to be in base64 with ""="" as the a padding character. I generated the base64 hash digest using ldap utility slappasswd.
Since in reality, I am supposed to insert users in the database using a C function and the available cryptographic libs such as OpenSSL only offer function for hex hash, I thought the best way is to know how to tell FreeRDAIUS that the digest stored in the database is NOT base64 but HEX. 
Does anyone know how I can do this? It seems that if I simply put {SHA} before the hashed value, it only works for base64 with FreeRADIUS. I would also like to know if FreeRADIUS supports other hash algorithms such as SHA256.
OS: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
PostgreSQL: 9.1
FreeRADIUS: 2.1.10
","No currently released versions support any of the SHA-2 hash algorithms.
The rlm_pap module in FreeRADIUS 2.1.10 should automatically 'normify' the 'known good' password, that is convert the hexits to binary, and assign it to the correct control: attribute. This works the same way for hexits as it does base64.

I have some 32-bit unsigned signals defined as such:
SIGNAL a, b : UNSIGNED (31 downto 0);

Within the specifications of the SHA-256 algorithm, it says addition must be performed modulo 2^32 in order to retain the 32-bit size in case of an overflow.    Now, according to the answer to this question, it sounds like overflow is already handled with modular addition in VHDL:

There is no overflow handling, the overflow carry is simply lost. Thus the result is simply the integer result of your operation modulo 2^MAX.

I have 2 questions:

In my case, MAX = 31 so does that mean that any addition operation I perform on a and b will be modded with 2^31?  
I need to perform addition modulo 2^32 which obviously doesn't make sense since I am working with 32-bit numbers and 2^32 is one bit too large.  So is it somehow implied that I should actually be modding with 2^31?

","You are fine with unsigned(31 downto 0). The 2^MAX in the post you reference is an error and should read 2^length. The length of 31 downto 0 is 32.
Think about it, 31 downto 0 can represent numbers from 0 to 2^32-1, it wouldn't make much sense if any addition of that range would be modulo 2^31 if you can represent larger numbers!
I'm not sure I understand your second question, but addition modulo 2^32 yields results in the range of 0 to 2^32-1. 2^32 is illegal, thus it's quite fine that you can't represent it with your unsigned.

Why are they different?

They're not, really. They're the same bits. It's just that Java doesn't have unsigned bytes - so any byte with the top bit set is negative. In every case like that, you'll see that Java result = Go result - 256.
If you convert both byte arrays to hex or base64, you'll see same results.

    s := make([]int8, sha256.Size)

The fmt doc does mention:

There is no 'u' flag. Integers are printed unsigned if they have unsigned type. 

Since Numeric Types defines:

byte        alias for uint8
uint8       the set of all unsigned  8-bit integers (0 to 255)
int8        the set of all signed  8-bit integers (-128 to 127)

That is why you would need to convert byte (unsigned) into signed int8 to see the same.

If you add base64 encoding (see golang playground), you can get a result easier to compare:
import ""encoding/base64""

res := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString([]byte(sum224[:]))
fmt.Println(res)

That returns:

","Assuming you are using the request module from npm, you should verify the type of the object you are receiving for the body argument is a Buffer. Looking at the source for the request module, I suspect you are getting a String instead. You might try doing the following when requiring request:
var request = require(""request"").defaults({ encoding: null });

That should tell the request module that you want a Buffer object by default.

const char *string = (const unsigned char *) [myString cStringUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncodin];

this always gives  nil since it contains the ¥ character. 
the problem is I cannot use UTF8Encoding since the hash generated by windows uses ASCII encoding like so:
string text =""123456¥"";
byte[] arrSHA = System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(text);

although using UTF8 Encoding in objective c does work, I cannot use it as it will give a different byte array than the one generated in .Net which will result a completely different SHA for that string.
Any suggestions on how to make this work?

UPDATE:
reading the documentation about ASCII encoding in .Net it seems that it convert every non ASCII character to ?. Can I detect these characters in objective c and manually replace them with ?
Regards
","The best solution would be if the server used UTF-8 instead of ASCII encoding.
If that is not an option, you can use the following code for the conversion,
where all non-ASCII characters are substituted by a question mark
(error-checking omitted for brevity):
NSString *myString = @""ä123€456¥"";

CFIndex asciiLength;
// Determine length of converted data:
CFStringGetBytes((__bridge CFStringRef)(myString), CFRangeMake(0, [myString length]),
                 kCFStringEncodingASCII, '?', false, NULL, 0, &asciiLength);
// Allocate buffer:
uint8_t *asciiBuffer = malloc(asciiLength);
// Do the conversion:
CFStringGetBytes((__bridge CFStringRef)(myString), CFRangeMake(0, [myString length]),
                 kCFStringEncodingASCII, '?', false, asciiBuffer, asciiLength, NULL);

// Check the result:
printf(""%.*s\n"", (int)asciiLength, asciiBuffer);
// Output: ?123?456?

There is (as far as I know) no equivalent NSString method, therefore you have
to use the ""toll-free bridge"" from NSString to CFStringRef and a Core Foundation
function.

These to hash variables must be based on the extension in some way, but I am not sure how exactly.
Could anyone point me in the right direction as to how firefox generates these hash codes?

","Firefox does not generate these hashes at all. It is the Add-on SDK which does. The Firefox extension manager does not care about harness-options.json at all. The SDK loader in turn, does care about harness-options.json a bit, but doesn't do anything with jsSHA256 or docsSHA256 at the moment. Other tools, such as the validator that runs when you upload something to addons.mozilla.org, do care about jsSHA256 at least.
It should be noted that add-ons not using the SDK do not (normally) contain a harness-options.json file at all.
There will be one jsSHA256 per module lib/, e.g. one for main.js and so on.
docsSHA256 for main.js will be generated from README.md when the SDK builds the XPI. Apparantly, README.md is not packed into the XPI. For all other modules it appears docsSHA256 appears to be null.
The code in question lives in manifest.py.
In the end you shouldn't mess with the XPI (other than repacking an unpacked extension) and/or extensions.sqlite at all. Especially the latter isn't meant to be modified externally.
Just drop the your XPIs files in the corresponding extensions/ folder of the profile and the Add-on manager will automatically pick them up the next time you start the browser.

How can I configure hibernate with annotation to use sha1 to save the password field when I call 
session.save(User);
","There is no such annotation for Hibernate. If you are using JPA you can define a @PrePersist method to compute the SHA-1 password prior to saving the user object. If you are using regular Hibernate you can do the same with an entity listener.
I would recommend though, that you explicitly handle the hashing of the password in your code, so that it's always clear when it's being done, and how. It's also possible to push the hashing function all the way down to the DB, but of all the options that is probably the least preferred. 
Don't forget to salt your password before hashing it!

"28251448","Hash function with ability to define its output generation length","I need to have a hash function in matlab which has capability to define its generated hashing length. For example, MD5 can generated hashing with length of 128 bits. However, I need to define various hashing function with designed lengths such as 10,16,20, ...
","Here's a possible solution if you employ the CalcMD5 package from FEX (Matlab File Exchange):
function hash = myhash(len, value)
% len: The desired hash length. Integer
% value: The value to hash. String.

% Set this to whatever hash length your native hash algorithm employs.
nativehashlength = 32;
if len <= nativehashlength
    % Using the CalcMD5 package to obtain MD5 hash
    hash = CalcMD5(value);
    hash = hash(1:len);
else
    % Could to a lot of stuff, but i choose to hash the repeated value
    runs = ceil(len/nativehashlength);
    hash = [];
    aggregated = value;
    for r = 1:runs
        % Compute hash and add to hash string
        hash = [hash CalcMD5(aggregated)]; %#ok
        % Update the aggregate
        aggregated = [aggregated value]; %#ok
    end
    hash = hash(1:len);
end
end

This also works for strings/char arrays of short length, e.g.
>> myhash(100,'hello')
ans = 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c59223b431acfeb41e15d466d75de822307c99fb31087791f6317ad7c6da1433f1729436
>> myhash(2,'world') 
ans =
7d

Of course, the hash of size 10 for 'hello' will equal the first ten hash characters of the size 20 hash of 'hello', but it was not asked to generate very different hash functions depending on the desired hash size. this could, however, be easily implemented by salting the value with the requested hash size, for example.
There's more on FEX regarding hashing of stuff in Matlab, e.g. here.

","This doesn't answer the actual question, but note that with SHA3 you don't really need HMAC hashes. Unlike SHA1 and SHA2 and MD5, SHA3 is not vulnerable to length-extension attacks.
Therefore with SHA3 it would suffice to just prepend or append the secret key to your input.
Or, if you're paranoid of a single hash step becoming compromised (not to be expected in the foreseeable future, especially not with SHA3, but still) you could do something like SHA3(key+SHA3(key+data)) or SHA3(key+SHA3(key+data)+data) (obviously with ""+"" denoting binary concatenation).

As a junior developer who is a Lua noob, I would like to use the HTTPLuaModule to generate Facebook appsecret_proof tokens. Currently I found that there is the LuaCrypto module for Lua to generate HMAC via SHA256 but it doesn't exactly match the implementation needed for Facebook's token: 

digest = crypto.hmac.digest('sha256', user-access-token, app-secret, true) ## what next to convert digest into hexadecimal string?

Unlike in the Amazon example above, the token doesn't need to be Base64 encode but instead the HMAC needs to be turned into a string of double length using only hexadecimal digits (hence hexidecimal!). 
In Python I can obtain the token with:

import hashlib
import hmac
token = hmac.new(app-secret, user-access-token, hashlib.sha256).hexadecimal()

","This got me too - it's the Gradle Console you're looking for!

Mine was in the bottom right - yours could be somewhere else
UPDATE:
I also notice that you can view it in the Run console by selecting the ""Toggle task executions/text mode"" - this will take you from the output that tells you about the gradle execution process to the actual outputs and logs from that process. 
To all the people telling him to use keytool - he is looking for a way to do it within the IDE, not the first result you got when you googled..!

","The solution by @SonOfHarpy technically works but has several issues, namely:

unnecessary use of temporary tables
overly complicated string assignment approach
use of fixed system table schema (SYS.TABLE_COLUMNS) instead of PUBLIC synonym
wrong data type and variable name for the input parameter

An improved version of the code looks like this:
create procedure SHA_PREP (in TABLE_NAME nvarchar(256))
as 
begin
declare SQL_STR nvarchar(5000);

    SELECT 
          'UPDATE ""SCHEMA_NAME"".""TABLE_NAME"" SET ""SHA""= hash_sha256(' || STRING_AGG(A, ', ') || ')'
          into SQL_STR
    FROM (
        SELECT  
            'TO_VARBINARY(IFNULL(""'|| ""COLUMN_NAME"" ||'"",''0''))' as A
        FROM TABLE_COLUMNS
        WHERE 
                ""SCHEMA_NAME"" = 'SCHEMA_NAME' 
           AND ""TABLE_NAME"" = :TABLE_NAME
           AND ""COLUMN_NAME"" != 'SHA'
        ORDER BY POSITION 
        );

  --  select :sql_str from dummy; -- this is for debugging output only
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE (:SQL_STR);
end; 

By changing the CONCAT functions to the shorter || (double-pipe) operator, the code becomes a lot easier to read as the formerly nested function calls are now simple chained concatenations.  
By using SELECT ... INTO variable the whole nonsense with the temporary table can be avoided, again, making the code easier to understand and less prone to problems.
The input parameter name now correctly reflects its meaning and mirrors the HANA dictionary data type for TABLE_NAME (NVARCHAR(256)). 
The procedure now consists of two commands (SELECT and EXECUTE IMMEDIATE) that each performs an essential task of the procedure:  

Building a valid SQL update command string. 
Executing the SQL command.

I removed the useless line-comments but left a debugging statement as a comment in the code, so that the SQL string can be reviewed without having to execute the command. 
For that to work, obviously, the EXECUTE... line needs to be commented out and the debugging line has to be uncommented.
What's more worrying than the construction of the solution is its purpose.
It looks as if the SHA column should be used as a kind of shorthand row-data fingerprint. The UPDATE approach certainly handles this as an after-thought activity but leaves the ""finger-printing"" for the time when the update gets executed.
Also, it takes an essential part of the table design (that the SHA column should contain the fingerprint) away from the table definition.
An alternative to this could be a GENERATED COLUMN:
create  table test (aaa int, bbb int);
alter table test add (sha varbinary (256) generated always as 
                        hash_sha256(to_varbinary(IFNULL(""AAA"",'0'))
                                 ,  to_varbinary(IFNULL(""BBB"",'0'))
                                    )
                       );

insert into test (aaa, bbb) values (12, 32);

select * from test;

/*
AAA BBB SHA                                                             
12  32  B6602F58690CA41488E97CD28153671356747C951C55541B6C8D8B8493EB7143
*/ 

With this, the ""generator"" approach could be used for table definition/modification time, but all the actual data handling would be automatically done by HANA, whenever values get changed in the table.
Also, no separate calls to the procedure will ever be necessary as the fingerprints will always be current.

","Arrays are objects too in Java, but they don't override Object's toString() method.  The output is not the hashed output, but the result of Object's toString() method.

[T]his method returns a string equal to the value of:

getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode())

The getClass().getName() is responsible for [B, then there is the @ character, and the rest of the characters are the hexadecimal hash code, also from Object.
You need to convert the byte array to a String in another way besides calling toString().  This may involve conversion of the byte array to Base 64 or to hexadecimal characters.

From server i got this
pbkdf2_sha256$10000$v2WJyd8HkqhU$QVAp707PYTiFDHvzjwBCTbecr9+6q2OIPsunPyOxXGU=

","So BouncyCastle(the crypto provider in Andorid) doesn't implement PBKDF2 using SHA256, so you will have to get very slightly custom.  This SO answer tells you which class to modify to get the algorithm set up.  Then you will need to integrate it, or figure out how to call it yourself (and I'm afraid I can't help much on that)
as far as the hash itself goes the format (as defined here) is:
<algorithm>$<iteration count>$<salt>$<hash>

where in your case the iteration count is 10000, your salt is the ascii string v2WJyd8HkqhU and the the hash is the byte array represented by the base64 string QVAp707PYTiFDHvzjwBCTbecr9+6q2OIPsunPyOxXGU=
You will compute the hash of the utf8 string of the password with the parameters specified.  Then, you can either base64 encode the output of the hash and compare the strings, or base64 decode the recieved hash and compare the byte arrays.  Apache Commons Codec provides some good Base64 encoding/decoding methods in its Base64 class.

"12804551","I'm using MD5 to hash passwords. When should I jump to the next thing? SHA-3?","On the 2nd of October NIST decided that SHA-3 is the new standard hashing algorithm.
Should MD5 users start migrating to SHA-3? To something else (see below why SHA-3 is not recommended)? bcrypt? 
Why Not {MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, SHA-3, etc}?
And, is this really critical? Even if your password is salted?
","The main reason not to use MD5 for hashing passwords is not the fact that MD5 is severely compromised or even considered broken.
It’s true, MD5 has known vulnerabilities. But none of them do pose a serious threat to your use of MD5. Because in your case the only threat would be a preimage attack where an attacker would try to find a preimage of a known hash, e.g. the password to a known (salted) password hash. And the probably known preimage attack against MD5 is only theoretical and lowers the effort from 2128 to 2123.4, which is no big advantage. A brute-force attack with an average of 264 is still more promising.
No, the main reason not to use MD5 is because MD5 is too fast. With a todays affordable computer you can generate and test 7190M MD5 hashes per second. All 8 characters long combinations of alphanumeric characters can be brute-forced in about 8.5 hours, no matter whether with or without salt.
In contrast to that, with the hash function like bcrypt $2a$ one can only generate and test 4085 hashes per second, so only 0.00005682 % of the number of MD5 hashes. With bcrypt $2a$ you would need 1694 years for the same attempt.

Thanks,

","Thanks for the reply..
I got below command working to meet my scenario for now.. but trying to see if there is any direct command to find the latest ID of a file on remote server...

git log 'branch-name' -- 'file-name'

which displaying log messages with ID, Author and Date.. I am fetching the top first line with unix pipe head command.

git log 'branch-name' -- 'file-name' | head -1

"50226112","How to calculate SHA-256 checksum of S3 file content","S3 out of the box provides the MD5 checksum of the S3 object content. But I need to calculate the SHA-256 checksum of the file content. The file could be large enough so I do not want to load the file in memory and calculate the checksum, instead I need a solution to calculate the checksum without loading the whole file in memory.
","It can be achieved by following steps in Java:

Get InputStream of the S3 Object
Use MessageDigest and DigestInputStream classes for the SHA-256 hash(or SHA-1 or MD5)

Following is the snippet on how to do it:
String getS3FileHash(AmazonS3 amazonS3, String s3bucket, String filePath) {
    try {
        InputStream inputStream = amazonS3.getObject(s3bucket, filePath).getObjectContent();
        MessageDigest messageDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");
        DigestInputStream digestInputStream = new DigestInputStream(inputStream, messageDigest);
        byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];
        int count = 0;
        while (digestInputStream.read(buffer) > -1) {
            count++;
        }
        log.info(""total read: "" + count);
        MessageDigest digest = digestInputStream.getMessageDigest();
        digestInputStream.close();
        byte[] md5 = digest.digest();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (byte b: md5) {
            sb.append(String.format(""%02X"", b));
        }
        return sb.toString().toLowerCase();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        log.error(e);
    }

","Your bodyParserJSON should return rawBody:
bodyParser.json({
    verify(req, res, buf) {
      req.rawBody = buf;
    },
})

Here is a middleware that I've written. It uses crypto module to generate sha1
fbWebhookAuth: (req, res, next) => {
    const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha1', process.env.FB_APP_SECRET);
    hmac.update(req.rawBody, 'utf-8');
    if (req.headers['x-hub-signature'] === `sha1=${hmac.digest('hex')}`) next();
    else res.status(400).send('Invalid signature');
}

and finally in your route you can use it as:
app.post('/webhook/facebook', middlewares.fbWebhookAuth, facebook.webhook);

","Play store requires .apk to be signed before you can publish it there.
If you've made an app with AppsGeyser and published it to Play then your application is signed by the AppsGeyser private keys (unless you've explicitly signed the .apk before publising it or if you've provided your secret keystore to AppsGeyser which is unlikely).
AppsGeyser wont give you their keystore and you need it to be able to sign new version of your software. Here is the quote from docs about this:

Your private key is required for signing all future versions of your application. If you lose or misplace your key, you will not be able to publish updates to your existing application. You cannot regenerate a previously generated key.

In other words you have 2 options here. Either stick with AppsGeyser and update your app using their services or publish update to your application as a whole new appliation.

http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/source/browse/trunk/MurmurHash3.h
Doesn't seem to provide a way to update the hash incrementally, though--it seems to compute one separate hash per block of data given. For example, if I were hashing 512MB of data from disk I might not want to load it all in memory at once, or if I were hashing an unknown amount of data from the network. Has anyone ever used MurmurHash3 in such a context before (hashing a large amount of data incrementally)? If you could point me to some resources or an alternate implementation, that would be great :). I am looking for something similar to SHA256_Update from OpenSSL.
Thanks!

","MS-DOS used the CR-LF convention,So basically while saving the file in windows, \r\n comes in effect for carriage return and newline. And while testing on online (given by you),  only  \n character comes in effect. 
Thus either you have to check the checksum of Test Message\r\nHello World\r\n in string which is equivalent to creating and reading file in windows(as given above), which is the case here. 
However, the checksum of files,wherever created, will be same.

     ptr += 2;
 }

ret = str;
/* Call this once before exit. */
EVP_cleanup();
return ret;

As for the wrong checksum earlier, the problem was associated in how windows keeps the line feed. As suggested by Zangetsu, Windows was making text file as CRLF, but linux and the site I mentioned earlier was using LF. Thus there was difference in the checksum value.

","sha256sum, a program a part of the coreutils package on linux will generate checksums for the listed files. The format of the checksum output is the same as that of the md5sum program (but using SHA-256 hashing instead of MD5 of course), which has been widely used for years. You didn't list any target platforms but a quick googling shows there are Windows ports of the command line program.
If you need to generate large numbers of checksums you can use md5deep, which includes support for other hashes as well, including SHA-256.

I tried some approaches with converting the JSON into a ruby hash, deep sort them by their keys, append everything into one, long string and hash it. But I bet that my solution isn't the most efficient one, and that there must be a better way to do this.
EDIT
So far, I convert JSON into a Ruby hash. Then I try to use this function to get a canonical representation:
  def self.canonical_string_from_hash value, key=nil
    str = """"
    if value.is_a? Hash
      value.keys.sort.each do |k|
        str += canonical_string_from_hash(value[k], k)
      end
    elsif value.is_a? Array
      str += key.to_s
      value.each do |v|
        str += canonical_string_from_hash(v)
      end
    else
      str += key ? ""#{key}#{value}"" : value.to_s
    end
    return str
  end

But I'm not sure, if this is a good and efficient way to do this.
For example, this hash
hash = {
  id: 3,
  zoo: ""test"",
  global: [
    {ukulele: ""ringding"", blub: 3},
    {blub: nil, ukulele: ""rangdang"", guitar: ""stringstring""}
  ],
  foo: {
    ids: [3,4,5],
    bar: ""asdf""
  }
}

gets converted to this string:
barasdfids345globalblub3ukuleleringdingblubguitarstringstringukulelerangdangid3zootest

","
But I'm not sure, if this is a good and efficient way to do this.

Depends on what you are trying to do. Your canonical/equivalent structures need to represent what is important to you for the comparison. Removing details such as object structure makes sense if you consider two items with different structure but same string values equivalent.
According to your comments, you are attempting to sign a request that is being transferred from one system to a second one. In other words you want security, not a measure of similarity or a digital fingerprint for some other purpose. Therefore equivalent requests are ones that are identical in all the ways that affect the processing that you want to protect. It is simpler, and very likely more secure, to lock down the raw bytes of data that transfer between your two systems.
In which case your whole approach needs a re-think. The reasons for that are probably best discussed on security.stackoverflow.com
However, in brief:

Use an HMAC routine (HMAC-SHA512), it is designed for your purpose. Instead of a salt, this uses a secret, which is essentially the same thing (in fact you need to keep your salt a secret in your implementation too, which is unusual for something called a salt), but has been combined with the SHA in a way which makes it resilient to a couple of attack forms possible against simple concatenation followed by SHA. The worst of these is that it is possible to extend the data and have it generate the same SHA when processed, without needing to know the salt. In other words, an attacker could take a known valid request and use it to forge other requests which will get past your security check. Your proposed solution looks vulnerable to this form of attack to me.
Unpacking the request and analysing the details to get a ""canonical"" view of the request is not necessary, and also reduces the security of your solution. The only reason for doing this is that you are for some reason not able to handle the request once it has been serialised to JSON, and are forced to work only with the de-serialised request at one end or another of the two systems. If that is purely a knowledge or convenience thing, then fix that problem rather than trying to roll your own security protocol using SHA-512.
You should sign the request, and check the signature, against the fully serialised JSON string. If you need to de-serialise data from a ""man-in-the-middle"" attack, then you are potentially already exposed to some attacks via the parser. You should work to reject suspect requests before any data processing has been done to them.

TL;DR - ALthough not a direct answer to your question, the correct solution for you is to not write this code at all. Instead you need to place your secure signature code closer to the ins and outs of your two services that need to trust each other.

","The pysha3 module you found was based on an draft of the SHA-3 specification, before it was standardised.
The module was created as a POC for Python issue 16113, and the code has not been updated since 2012. The NIST standard wasn't finalised until October 2015. As such, the implementation can't be used if you expect it to follow the released standard.
That ticket links to an implementation that does claim to have been updated to the standard: https://github.com/bjornedstrom/python-sha3. That package doesn't appear to be listed on PyPI, but can be installed with pip directly from GitHub:
pip install git+https://github.com/bjornedstrom/python-sha3

"22976617","OpenCL SHA1 Throughput Optimisation","Hoping someone more experienced in OpenCL usage may be able to help me here!!  I'm doing a project (to help me learn a bit more crypto and to try my hand at GPGPU programming) where I'm trying to implement my own SHA1 algo. Ultimately my question is about maximizing my throughput rates - at present I'm seeing something like 56.1 MH/sec, which compares very badly to OpenSource programs I've looked at, such as John the Ripper and OCLHashcat, which are giving 1000 and 1500 MH/sec respectively (heck, I'd be well-chuffed with a 3rd of that!).
So, what I'm doing; I've written a SHA1 implementation in an OpenCL kernel and a C++ host application to load data to the GPU (using CL 1.2 C++ wrapper).  I'm generating blocks of candidate data to hash in a threaded fashion on the CPU and loading this data onto the global GPU memory using the CL C++ call to enqueueWriteBuffer (using uchars to represent the bytes to hash):
    errorCode = dispatchQueue->enqueueWriteBuffer(
        inputBuffer,
        CL_FALSE,//CL_TRUE,
        0,
        sizeof(cl_uchar) * inputBufferSize,
        passwordBuffer,
        NULL,
        &dispatchDelegate);

I'm en-queuing data using enqueueNDRangeKernel in the following manner (where global  worksize is a user-defined variable, at present I've set this to my GPUs maximum flattened global worksize of 16.777 million per run):
errorCode = dispatchQueue->enqueueNDRangeKernel(
    *kernel,
    NullRange,
    NDRange(globalWorkgroupSize, 1), 
    NullRange, 
    NULL,
    NULL);

Meaning, that per dispatch, I load 16.777 million items in a 1D array and index from my kernel into this using get_global_offset(0).  My Kernel signature:
__kernel void sha1Crack(__global uchar* out, __global uchar* in, 
                        __constant int* passLen, __constant int* targetHash, 
                        __global bool* collisionFound)
{
    //Kernel Instance Global GPU Mem IO Mapping:
    __private int id = get_global_id(0);
    __private int inputIndexStart = id * passwordLen;

    //Select Password input key space:
    #pragma unroll
    for (i = 0; i < passwordLen; i++)
    {
        inputMem[i] = in[inputIndexStart + i];
    }

    //SHA1 Code omitted for brevity...
}

So, given this, am I doing something fundamentally wrong in the way I'm loading data? i.e. 1 call to enqueueNDrange for 16.7 million kernel executions over a 1D input vector? (should I be using a 2D space and sub-dividing into localworkgroup ranges? - I tried playing with this but it didn't seem quicker). 
Or, perhaps as likely is my algorithm itself the source of slowness (I've spent a good while optimizing it and manually unrolling all of the loop stages using pre-processor directives etc)?
I've read about memory coalescing on the hardware, is that my issue? :S
Any advice at all appreciated!  If I've missed anything important please let me know and I'll update.
Thanks in advance! ;)

Update: 16,777,216 is the device maximum reported workgroup size; 256**3. The global array of boolean values is one boolean.  It's set to false at the start of the kernel enqueue, then a branching statement sets this to true if a collision is found only - will that force a convergence? passwordLen is the length of the current input value and target hash is an int[4] encoded hash to check against.
","Your 'maximum flattened global worksize' should be multiplied by passwordLen. It is the number of kernels you can run, not the maximal length of an input array. You can most likely send much more data than this to the GPU.
Other potential issues: the 'generating blocks of candidate data to hash in a threaded fashion on the CPU', try doing this in advance of the kernel iterations to see whether the delay is in the generation of the data blocks or in the processing of the kernels; your sha1 algorithm is the other obvious potential issue. I'm not sure how much you've really optimised it by 'unrolling' the loops, usually the bigger optimisation issue is 'if' statements (if a single kernel instance within a workgroup tests to true then all of the lockstepped workgroup instances must follow that branch in parallel).
And DarkZeros is correct, you should manually play with the local workgroup size making it the highest common multiple of the global size and the number of kernels which can be run at once on the card. The easiest way to do this is to round up the global work group size to the next multiple of the card capacity and use an external if{} statement in the kernel only running the kernel for global_id less than the actual number of kernels you want to run.

Alright, so I know that SHA-1 produces a hash of 160 bits. 


Between two messages and the probability of 0.5, how many times should the said ""attacker"" have to search to find identical hash values?


I've come across a series of solutions from searching, but none that thoroughly walk me through the process and explain it in a way that makes sense to me. Below is the closest that I've been able to come up with during my search.

I hope this helps to explain my question.
","Yes, you're right; this circles around the Birthday Problem. In hashing you are essentially trying to place a something that can be of theoretically infinite length into a fixed length string through a mathematical process; a collision is therefore inevitable. 
The Birthday Problem basically means that suppose you had a hall full of people, you ask each person their date of birth. The probability of finding someone with the same birthday as another increases as you have more dates of birth which two people could have as the same. And eventually you will find someone who has the same birthday.

Aaron Toponce wrote about this in his piece ""The Reality of SHA1"" where he pointed out:

SHA1 was meant to be a replacement for MD5. MD5 has an output space of
  only 128-bits, where as SHA1 has an output space of 160-bits. SHA1 is
  also designed differently than MD5, and is meant to not suffer the
  same sort of weaknesses or attacks that MD5 faces. However, over time,
  cryptographers have been able to severely attack SHA1, and as a
  result, they've all been warning us to get off SHA1, and move to SHA2.
  It should take 2^160 operations to find a collision with SHA1, however
  using the Birthday Paradox, we can have a probability of 50% of
  finding a SHA1 collision in about 2^80 operations. However,
  cryptanalysists have torn down SHA1 to a complexity of only 2^61
  operations. Even better.

Essentially, the SHA1 is a mathematical algorithm, weaknesses can be found in algorithms which make them easier crack and reduce the probability of a collision. This research, usually done by computer scientists, cryptographers and mathematicians then can be used to reduce the chance of finding a collision by using new algorithms to find new ways of finding collisions.

Ultimately the hashing algorithim is SHA1, but it is not a simple SHA1 hash of the password, or even a SHA1 + salt hash.
It is worth pointing out that SHA1 is considered ""broken"" for digital signatures due to a mathematical attack, reducing the computational effort of generating a collision to just-about feasible levels. 
This does not apply to hashed passwords.

So isn't this above piece of code actually reducing the quality of uniqueness by hashing it with MD5 which is an obsolete hashing mechanism now and prone to collisions and attacks.
","Lets start with this:

According to UUID specification, UUID itself is very good in uniqueness of the generated UUID's and chances of collision are very very very small.

Actually, it doesn't say that.  It can't say that, because that does not make sense.
In fact, if the UUID spec says anything about the uniqueness of type 4 UUIDs it would say that they are only as good as the source of random numbers.  And that depends on the platform and the quality of the RNG & UUID implementations.  If we can assume a perfect1 source of random numbers, then the probability of any two (separately generated) UUIDs being the same is on in 2122; i.e. very, very small.  On the other hand, if you have a poor source of random numbers, the probability of pair-wise collision increases.

So isn't this above piece of code actually reducing the quality of uniqueness by hashing it with MD5 which is an obsolete hashing mechanism now and prone to collisions and attacks.

Yes.  But MD5 isn't the real problem.
As @Doug Stevenson says, hashing a UUID does not reduce the chance of a collision.  Not even for a hashing algorithm that has no known weakness.  Whatever the algorithm, there is a chance that hashing UUIDs will increase the probability of collisions2.
So basically, there is no point in hashing a single UUID.  
However, if you required a token that had a smaller probability of collision than a type 4 UUID, you could concatenate N type 4 UUIDs into a single byte array, and then create a hash for the array.  If you have a (strong) M-bit hashing algorithm, and a perfect source of random numbers for your UUID generator, then the chance of collision should be roughly one in 2min(M, 122 * N).

1 - That is, a source of random bits where it is impossible for someone (an attacker) to predict the next bit in the sequence with anything other than 50% probability of being correct.
2 - This will happen if there are any two distinct UUIDs that have the same hash.  That is possible even for a strong hashing algorithm ... unless you defined that to be a criteria by which you measure strength.

You need to use Shining Light's Win32OpenSSL or build OpenSSL yourself.
If you use Shining Light's version, everything is already built. While Thomas Hruska keeps Win32OpenSSL up to date with OpenSSL releases, I don't think he offers anything compatible with the version of C++ Builder 6 (circa 2002) you are using.
If you want to build OpenSSL from sources on the Win32 platform, then see INSTALL.W32 and INSTALL.W64 in the root directory of the OpenSSL distribution.
I believe you have a third option. That option is to grab a modern IDE. Microsoft offers a trial version of Visual Studio (the link for the Trial is on the right of the page). Embarcadero also offers a free trial version of C++ Builder XE5. Both should work with Shining Light's Win32OpenSSL.

","You get 1-6 more often because you fetch two hexadecimal digits from the hash. That's one byte, so it can store values from 0 to 255. Then you use modulo 50. In result you get ranges 0-49, 50-99, 100-149, 150-199, 200-249 and... 250-255. This last one is responsible for extra prevalence of 1-6 in your results.
Solution: just use mt_rand(1,50);

If you really need to convert a number from 0-255 range to 1-50 range, the solution would be scaling and rounding.

My questions are:

1) What is the use of it?
2) How to test and verify it on Window and linux?

Can I also make SHA-1 Checksum of any file?
","
1) What is the use of it?

In essence, hashing is a one-way (irreversible) process that takes some input data and produces a string - typically in hexadecimal - of a fixed length that uniquely* identifies that particular input data.
This is very useful and has many applications but in your case, it's used to verify the integrity of files. A website uploads the hash of a file for the world to see and when the file is downloaded on your computer, you check whether or not the hash you calculate locally matches the hash displayed on the website. If they match, the file is intact but if they don't, the file on your computer is not identical to the file on the server - most likely because it was damaged/altered in transit.

2) How to test and verify it on Windows and Linux?

At least on *nix systems, there are several ways of comparing hashes. Nothing is stopping you from manually checking every character of two hashes for equality - this is often fast when you simply want to check a single file. Anyway, most of the hashing programs have a -c option for this purpose that will output ""OK"" in case of a match. To manually input the hash and file and pipe both to sha1sum for comparison, do this:
$ echo ""672d844c60553f9b3db9844dc29ddf49bc426f45"" /bin/echo | sha1sum -c -
/bin/echo: OK

To calculate the hash and make a file (echo.sha1) containing the hash and file path + file name:
# calculate hash and write it along with the file path + file name to a file
$ sha1sum /bin/echo > echo.sha1

# see the contents of the file
$ cat echo.sha1 
672d844c60553f9b3db9844dc29ddf49bc426f45  /bin/echo

# do the comparison
$ sha1sum -c echo.sha1 
/bin/echo: OK

Microsoft apparently provides The File Checksum Integrity Verifier for the same purpose. I'm on Linux and haven't tested it but the description says:
""The File Checksum Integrity Verifier (FCIV) is a command-prompt utility that computes and verifies cryptographic hash values of files. FCIV can compute MD5 or SHA-1 cryptographic hash values. These values can be displayed on the screen or saved in an XML file database for later use and verification.""
I disagree with Microsoft's use of the phrase ""cryptographic hash"" in this context; maybe the program is outdated. Anyway, for the record, MD5 and SHA1 are not cryptographically secure hashing algorithms. They are, however, perfectly fine for doing quick file integrity checks.

Can I also make SHA-1 Checksum of any file?

You can indeed. In fact, there's no way of verifying file integrity without calculating the hash on your computer - its part of the process. 
To get the sha1 sum of a file on Linux/Unix (in this case the ""echo"" binary again), you can simply do:
$ sha1sum /bin/echo
672d844c60553f9b3db9844dc29ddf49bc426f45  /bin/echo

There are other SHA hash lengths:
$ sha512sum /bin/echo 
1f481804f114677efbfc1438b04e88af5be8507e098792b714939fcd346b7477fdb4ae0c53fd48e96d1031fc8d6e3d8c8d4c4c80e121f5c5a39d18c912b33a11  /bin/echo

MD5 was used for the same purpose for a long time and sometimes still is (but, again, don't use MD5 or SHA1 for cryptography):
$ md5sum /bin/echo 
482a44200637097351e30c80b1155c27  /bin/echo

As you can see below, it works for strings as well. The -n option after echo strips out the newline character that would otherwise be part of the string and result in a wrong hash.
$ echo -n ""some_string"" | sha256sum
539a374ff43dce2e894fd4061aa545e6f7f5972d40ee9a1676901fb92125ffee  

If you run a server and want to do password logins, you typically don't store the actual passwords but, instead, you store a hash of the passwords. In this case, add a salt to the password before hashing and use the currently recommended hashing algorithm - bcrypt is a good choice in 2016.
I could go on and on about checksums vs. cryptographic hashing vs. encryption, rainbow tables, hash collisions, etc. but that's beyond the scope of your question.

""(...) that uniquely identifies (...)"" is an over-statement. Here's why. Nothing in this world is perfect - except one-time pads :)

"26940498","wrong calculatin of sha256 hash in android","I have a problem generating a correct hash for a given string by android studio. I have read a lot of solutions without understanding how to convert it the right way.
I need the correct hash since i am making an HTTP request with it.
Here is my code in JAVA:
public String getHash(final String appSecret , final String sessionToken)throws NoSuchAlgorithmException ,UnsupportedEncodingException{

        String input = sessionToken + appSecret;
        MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");
        digest.reset();

        byte[] byteData = digest.digest(input.getBytes(""UTF-8""));
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();

        for (int i = 0; i < byteData.length; i++){
            sb.append(String.format(""%02x"", 0xFF & byteData[i]));
        }
        return sb.toString();

    }

For an input like:
1130_11825_253402300799_1_1bcb4a27d42524de11325ec627b63878770a8651c0a0d8ddfc8fc06b92aea281634ff11f7d874c03851932304601439e

I need the exact output:
01a9d698f0587a25ad8ef56b0994ec0022364aff91d668a4b3a4b97c40167672

but i got a wrong output:
a60f61b5e9f832b153a91e8d2b1ffa28b9611b2d60c3669663cfe050ac8e28cc

I think my problem is how to read/print the string but i can't figure out how to correct it.
I know that an online hash calculator return a correct hash.

","Please please don't use SHA* for hashing passwords, instead use a slow key-derivation function like BCrypt or PBKDF2 with a cost factor. The verification cannot be done in an SQL statement directly (because of the salt), so you have to do it in your PHP code:
// Hash a new password for storing in the database.
// The function automatically generates a cryptographically safe salt.
$hashToStoreInDb = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);

// Check if the hash of the entered login password, matches the stored hash.
// The salt and the cost factor will be extracted from $existingHashFromDb.
$isPasswordCorrect = password_verify($password, $existingHashFromDb);

Therefore, I deduce that Perl is somehow running a different echo command, perhaps /bin/echo or /usr/bin/echo instead of the bash built-in echo, or maybe the built-in echo to /bin/sh (which might perhaps be dash rather than bash), and this other echo does not recognize the -n option as an option and outputs different data.
I'm not sure which other echo it is finding; on my machine which is running an Ubuntu 14.04 LTE derivative, bash, dash, sh (linked to bash), ksh, csh and tcsh all treat echo -n abcd the same way.

","Summary: In your Perl script, -n is being treated as an argument to include in the output of echo, not a flag to suppress the newline. ( Try 
$hash = `echo -n 'abcd'`;

to confirm). Use printf instead.

Perl uses /bin/sh to execute code in back tics. Even if /bin/sh is a link to bash, it will behave differently when invoked via that like. In POSIX mode,
echo -n 'abcd'

will output
-n abcd

that is, the -n option is not recognized as a flag to suppress a newline, but is treated as a regular argument to print. Replace echo -n with printf in each script, and you should get the same SHA hash from each script.
(UPDATE: bash 3.2, when invoked as sh, displays this behavior. Newer versions of bash seem to continue treating -n as a flag when invoked as sh.)

Even better, don't shell out to do things you can do in Perl.
use Digest::SHA;

$hash = Digest::SHA::sha256('abcd');


For the curious, here's what the POSIX spec has to say about echo. I'm not sure what to make of XSI conformance; bash echo requires the -e option to treat the escape characters specially, but nearly every shell—except old versions of bash, and then only under special circumstances—treats -n as a flag, not a string. Oh well.
The following operands shall be supported:

string
A string to be written to standard output. If the first operand is -n, or
if any of the operands contain a <backslash> character, the results are
implementation-defined.

On XSI-conformant systems, if the first operand is -n, it shall be treated
as a string, not an option. The following character sequences shall be
recognized on XSI-conformant systems within any of the arguments:

\a
Write an <alert>.
\b
Write a <backspace>.
\c
Suppress the <newline> that otherwise follows the final argument in the output. All characters following the '\c' in the arguments shall be ignored.
\f
Write a <form-feed>.
\n
Write a <newline>.
\r
Write a <carriage-return>.
\t
Write a <tab>.
\v
Write a <vertical-tab>.
\\
Write a <backslash> character.
\0num
Write an 8-bit value that is the zero, one, two, or three-digit octal number num.

I know someone will think that the SignatureDescription class will be a solution but I have tried this as well.

I have configured the machine.config to work with my relevant hash IDs
SHA1 is working properly and till now the SHA1 was kind of hard coded. If you'll need any other information, you are welcome to ask for it.
Pay attention I'm talking about Net Framework 3.0 so 4.0 solutions are not relevant unless you will say that there is no other choice(Last resort).

If you don't have (or want) access to the entire string to be hashed at once, it allows you to read some data, operate on it, read some more, operate on it, and so on until you've read all the data. At the end, you can get the overall hash of the entire data stream.
Just for example, let's assume you're running this on a computer with 4 Gigs of RAM, and you want to hash a 16 gigabyte file. Since the data won't fit in RAM (or even close to it) the second is probably a better choice for this case. Likewise, if you're receiving data over the network, but don't (necessarily) want to store all the raw packets just so you can hash them and (for example) acknowledge receipt.

","Check the encoding, make sure that the actual byte arrays that are used to compute the hash are equal. In .NET you use ASCII encoding and in Android iso-8859-1. This should not mater as the iso-8859-1 is natural extension of the ASCII encoding, but still, check the arrays.

"50321301","How To Hash Social Security Numbers When Used As Identifiers","I have a service that let's users store information (such as messages, videos', etc.) for their extended family online to be shared when they pass away. Ex - Send this video to my nephew when I pass way telling him I love him. 
I have a JSON structured database that stores a users social security number as an identifier to their profile. 
 $salted_hashed_ssn: {
    //important information for extended family such as vidoes and email addresses
   }

When a user dies, their closest family members go to my site and input the deceased person's social security number. I then hash those and see if a match is made in my database. If a match is made, we then run functions to share the important information for the extended family. 
Preparing for the worst, I want to store the social security numbers as securely as possible. Because I only need to use the social security numbers as a identifier, I don't have to store the raw/plain text ssn values. Therefore, I can hash the ssns but I need to salt them to protect against lookup tables. My issue is that when the users input the deceased user's social security number I don't have a way to see which salt key was used. 
To make it random and prevent against lookup tables, how would you recommend I salt my social security numbers? Should I just take x number of characters each time? Ie - always grab the first 4 characters of the social security number, hash those, and them to the full SSN and then rehash?
let salted_hashed_ssn = SHA256(First 4 characters of SSN) + SHA256(SSN) ?
How would you recommend setting up the salt and hash?
","You can treat your SSN in the same way you would treat a password.  Remember, a salt doesn't have to be secret, it just has to be different for each entry.  So simply store your salt alongside your hash, this is perfectly safe.
I wouldn't recommend using SHA256 here, however.  Use bcrypt instead.  It handles the salt for you, which means you don't need to worry about the advice above anyway.  It's also far more resistant to brute forcing.  The SHA family was not designed for hashing in the way you are using it.

I created two programs, a client and a server, that communicate via socket in Java.
Now the problem is, when I receive an object from an InputStream on the server's socket, I have to take the SHA384 of the value received and check to ensure it is the same as the SHA384 computed by the client. I checked in debug mode that the received value is the same as the sent value, but when I take the SHA384 of this value I obtain a different hash than the client.
Why? The client is an android application and the server side is in simple Java.

","Minor issue: for Strings, you rely on getBytes(), which uses the system's default charset.  The result can be different if the client and server use different default charsets.  You should instead use getBytes(String), specifying an appropriate charset name:
return ((String) obj).getBytes('UTF-8');

But the major issue is that you use ObjectOutputStream.writeObject() to create your byte sequence for non-strings.  There is no particular reason to expect that that method will yield byte-for-byte identical byte sequences when applied to any two distinct objects, even if those objects are equivalent in some relevant sense.  You might get that result for objects of some classes, but I can definitely write a class whose instances will not have that property.
Oh, and your method will break if you pass it an object that isn't Serializable.
I don't know of any way to do what you are attempting at the level of generality you are trying to do it.

However, your input for the hash isn't quite that random.  message_id is a globally unique identifier which ""only"" has 5.3e+36 possible values, and the randomness depends on the implementation. According to the wiki link, the odds of a collision are about 50% at 4.2e+18 samples. Email addresses and dates are likely significantly higher than that.

","This approach is expensive, since, every time you run this query, MySQL will have to examine every single record in clients and compute the SHA-1 hash of its id and key. (I'm assuming here that clients has more than a few rows, or at least, that you'd like to use an approach that supports the case where clients has more than a few rows.)
Why don't you add a new field called (say) id_key_sha1? You can use a trigger to keep the field populated, and add an index on it. This approach should perform much better.
Edited to add: You mention that the client, in addition to passing in this SHA-1 hash, also has to submit a username and password? I don't know what your table structure looks like, but I'm guessing that it would make more sense to find the client record based on the username first, and then comparing the SHA-1 hash for that specific record, rather than trying to find the record by the SHA-1 hash.

OpenSSL 1.0.1 has SHA256 that I'd like to use. The method itself in the OpenSSL lib C code:
unsigned char *SHA256(const unsigned char *d, size_t n, unsigned char *md)
{
    SHA256_CTX c;
    static unsigned char m[SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH];

    if (md == NULL)
        md = m;
    SHA256_Init(&c);
    SHA256_Update(&c, d, n);
    SHA256_Final(md, &c);
    OPENSSL_cleanse(&c, sizeof(c));
    return (md);
} 

The function itself returns a pointer, and as parameters it needs the input data, the length of the data to hash, and an object for the hash.
I'm wrapping it in the next way:
[DllImport(DLLNAME, CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
public extern static IntPtr SHA256(byte[] data, long len, ref byte[] result);

I'm trying to run it the next way:
byte[] d = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(""aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"");
byte[] r = new byte[32];
IntPtr x = NOpenSSL.Wrapper.SHA256(d, d.Length, ref r);
Console.WriteLine(d.Length + "" "" + x + "" "" + r.Length + "" "" + Encoding.ASCII.GetString(r));

And what i get for result: 16 1838788744 1. The d.Length is 16 OK, I get the x as a pointer OK, the r.Length becomes 1 byte that is impossible.
If I don't ref the byte[] in the method just simply give it to it nothing changes in the variable r.
Can anyone help me please what am i doing wrong?
Thank you for the help in advance!
","After some dicovery of the OpenSSL C source and experimenting with C# pointers and Marshaling it turned out the SHA256 method does not put the result hash in the variable md, but it returns a pointer to the hash. (First i thought it's the pointer of the SHA256-struct, but it is the actual hash.)
The working C# code is the following:
[DllImport(DLLNAME, CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
public extern static IntPtr SHA256(byte[] data, long len, byte[] result);

-
byte[] data = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(""some_data_to_hash"");

IntPtr r = NOpenSSL.Wrapper.SHA256(data, data.Length, null);
byte[] output = new byte[32];
Marshal.Copy(r, output, 0, output.Length);

// output contains now the 32 bytes of the hashed data

Since we are not using the 3rd variable of the SHA256 method (we just pass null instead) the ref is needed to be removed from the DllImport.
(Note: https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/crypto/sha.html says: If md is NULL, the digest is placed in a static array. Note: setting md to NULL is not thread safe.)
Using SHA512 is exactly the same just we need to replace the method name at both places in the code and change the output byte[] length from 32 to 64.

arr.hello = ""yes"";

","The issue is not with the sha256 function, but with the $HEX64 format. 
When you used lowcase you actually do some harm to the SHA256 result: you're not altering the hexadecimal representation, but you're actually altering the characters themselves, which means your result isn't accurate - and then you're displaying them with $HEX64. which will always show capital letters for the hexadecimal characters.
What instead you want, presumably, is to store the lower case version of the $HEX64. format.  You can do that with put:
data want;
  set have;
  source = catt(first,last,dob,sex);
  encryp = sha256(source);
  lower  = lowcase(put(encryp,$HEX64.));

","A long is only 64 bits. A SHA-256 digest has 256 bits (hence the name). So no, you can't (reversibly) perform that conversion.

"27696996","Why would signing credentials from a RSA-SHA512 X509Certificate2 appear to be RSA-SHA256?","Given a public/private key pair PFX file created from the following commands:
makecert.exe -r -n ""CN=TEST"" -pe -sv TEST.pvk -a sha512 -len 2048 -b 01/01/2014 -e 12/31/2075 TEST.cer
pvk2pfx.exe -pvk TEST.pvk -spc TEST.cer -pfx TEST.pfx

The following C# code:
X509Certificate2 cert = new X509Certificate2(""TEST.pfx"");
Console.WriteLine(cert.SignatureAlgorithm.FriendlyName);

var creds = new X509SigningCredentials(cert);
Console.WriteLine(creds.SignatureAlgorithm);
Console.WriteLine(""Key size: {0}"", creds.SigningKey.KeySize / 8);

Results in this:
sha512RSA
http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256
Key size: 256

What I am confused about is why the signing credentials are coming out as SHA256 when the cert was created SHA512?  Am I misunderstanding something?
","What you are probably misunderstanding is where the hashing algorithms are used. The first one is used during the creation of the signature over the certificate. The second one is the hashing algorithm that is used during signing with the private key that belongs to the certificate. That one seems to default to SHA-256.
Note that Microsoft is actually confusing hashing algorithms with signature algorithms. Maybe that once made some sense when everybody was still only using PKCS#1 v1.5 style signatures, but now it just makes them look stupid.

","SHA-1 vs. SHA-2 is completely unrelated to the problem you have. ""Less secure apps"" are considered for google the application which don't use OAuth 2.0 for authentication (which would allow for 2-factor authentication) but instead only a simple password.

How to implement or switch to SHA-2 certificate for email notifications?
","Although, SHA1 is more resistant than MD5 to collision attacks, but it is getting weaker each year. Therefore, google encourages to migrate away from SHA-1 to SHA-2/SHA-3.  
I think you should first acquire a SHA-2 certificate, and then use the following sample code to set it for SMTPClient:
string certificate = ""Certificate.cer"";

X509Certificate cert = new X509Certificate2(certificate);

MailMessage message = new MailMessage(from, to);

SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient(server);

client.ClientCertificates.Add(cert);

client.Send(message);

And also notice MSDN SmtpClient.ClientCertificates remarks:

The Framework caches SSL sessions as they are created and attempts to reuse a cached session for a new request, if possible. When attempting to reuse an SSL session, the Framework uses the first element of ClientCertificates (if there is one), or tries to reuse an anonymous sessions if ClientCertificates is empty.

I'm especially concerned about if any of the recursive-functions are not tail-recursive.

","The first thing you should do is get the test vectors from the standard and verify if your implementation generates the exact same result. If it does not, it's broken.
You can also generate other test vectors if you have a ""known sane"" implementation (the openssl command probably has one).
Finally, run some performance tests with progressively larger files, and compare with a known fast implementation (the openssl one should be quite fast). If it fails (exausting all memory or being too slow), you have to fix something on it.
If it passes all these tests, it should be good enough. There shouldn't be many security concerns with a hashing algorithm (unless you are hashing sensitive data, where you would have to be very careful to overwrite all the memory you used).

","Usually database systems do not support this kind of hash functions on their own. It would be difficult to write the queries anyway, because the password hashes are not searchable. To verify a password with its hash-value following steps are necessary:

Search for the row by username (cannot be done by the hash-value).
Return the password-hash from the found row.
Extract the used salt and the cost factor from the stored password-hash.
Build a new hash-value from the entered password with the same salt and cost factor.
Compare the stored hash-value and the new calculated one.

That means, you first have to know the stored hash-value, before you can verify the entered password with it. Such a hash function is surely better placed in the development language, than in the database, especially when you later have to switch the algorithm or the cost factor and need backwards compatibility.

I am trying to implement a call to Barclaycard Smartpay using hosted payment. Documentation here: 
Hosted Payment Page Integration Guide 
Note: that the barclays documentation is out of date (last updated 2012) and that the references to SHA-1 are now using SHA-256. It is built using Adyen payment systems and I have reused the string generation examples using the following example code: https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-asp.net-sample-code
","There is a problem with your signing string. You need to replace ""\"" with ""\"" and "":"" with "":"" in all your vallues.
I also suggest to use the code from this sample on GIT to generate create your encrypted signature.
Using the code below I get the same signature as on the test page provided by Adyen.
 // Computes the Base64 encoded signature using the HMAC algorithm with the HMACSHA256 hashing function.
    string CalculateHMAC(string hmacKey, string signingstring)

            // Base64-encode the hmac
            return Convert.ToBase64String(rawHmac);
        }
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        throw new Exception(""Failed to generate HMAC : "" + e.Message);
    }
}

byte[] PackH(string hex)
{
    if ((hex.Length % 2) == 1)
    {

    byte[] bytes = new byte[hex.Length / 2];

Signature: 
int EVP_DigestFinal_ex(EVP_MD_CTX *ctx, unsigned char *md, unsigned int *s);

Are there any cases where the digest length will be greater than the output size of the digest yet smaller than EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE. i.e. for SHA-1 digest, I get an output which is greater than 20bytes?
","Relevant source code from OpenSSL crypto/evp/digest.c:

    ret = ctx->digest->final(ctx, md);
    if (size != NULL)
       *size = ctx->digest->md_size;

where size is your desired output digest size, and digest is a const structure which in case of SHA1 is being defined in crypto/evp/m_sha1.c:
static const EVP_MD sha1_md = {

","If you are using UTF-8 characters in your strings, don't use string.Length to reserve bytes array. This is true if the string only contains ASCII characters, but if there is UTF-8 Characters in your string, then .Length will will be smaller than the actual byte size. 
Since you are using .Length to allocate an array, that array may be to small and not all of the strings data may be copied. 
I'd suggest that you use StringBuilder to build your string, and then use System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(stringbuilder.ToString()) to get the data as bytes. 
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
sb.Append(""commit ""+ Encoding.UTF8.GetByteCount(commitBody));

using LDAP server i am not too much aware with this.My request from application server to LDAP is 
already encrypted with certificate file but i still need to encrypt password using SHA-256. 
how can i do ???
My Java code is :
            Hashtable<String,String> env = new Hashtable<String,String>();
            env.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,""com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory"");

            env.put(Context.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL, ""abcd123""+""@""+ldap_domain);
            env.put(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS, ""mypassword"");
            env.put(Context.SECURITY_PROTOCOL,""ssl"");

            System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.keyStore"", keystorePath);
            System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword"", ""changeit"");
            ctx = new InitialDirContext(env);

I got this this but unable to do with SHA-256
","Generally, we would expect your LDAP server will encrypt the password. You just need to send itn in text over SSL. (or using StartTLS) 
If you are using SSL, then you are encrypted. Otherwise you would need to use something like SASL which requires support on the client and the server.

The database server version is Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and i dont have permissions to make changes to the database. The password column of the database is set to varchar(50) and a digest is 48 characters. The only information that i have for the passwords is that they have been hashed with sha-256 algoritm but as far as i know a sha-256 digest is 64 characters and not 48. Is it possible to produce the same 48 length digests with sha256?
","The only two primitive hash functions with native output size of 192 bits (48hex * 1byte/2hex * 8bit/byte) are HAVAL-192 and TIGER-192. None of the others match up exactly.
If they have indeed been hashed with sha256, then they may be truncated (as a hex encoded sha-256 digest is 64 characters.
To deduce the exact situation will take some work. Here are the different ways you can approach it.

If I had access to the original source code, I'd look at that. Considering you asked the question, I'll assume that's not possible.
If I could write a record into the old system, I'd set a sentinel password (or find an account I knew the password to). Something that I know. Then I'd find the hashed result from the DB.
So now we know p=password and h=4d9e.... 
From there, start by just hashing the password with sha256 and see what you come up with. If you're lucky, you'll find a pattern quickly (like the last half of the hash is just cut off). If you're not lucky, it'll take some digging and trial and error.
So, for example:
p = ""password""
h = ""5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd6""

The result would be: sha256(p)[0:48] as sha256(p) == ""5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8""
h = ""51d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8""

The result would be: sha256(p)[16:48]
And so on.
If I didn't have access to a known password, there would be no way of testing the hypothesis. So if you don't have the source code, and don't know an account in the system, you're basically out of luck. So make those first 2 your top priority.

Beware that you may have to get creative. It's entirely possible that something weird has been done. Such as:
salt = h[0:8]
tmp = sha256(p + salt)
h = salt + (tmp[0:16] xor tmp[16:16])

So have fun :-)

","There's a problem in Utility.cs:
    public static string GetString(byte[] bytes)
    {
        char[] chars = new char[bytes.Length / sizeof(char)];
        System.Buffer.BlockCopy(bytes, 0, chars, 0, bytes.Length);
        return new string(chars);
    }

The function is fed random bytes. This is not how you create a random string. Characters are not meant to store binary data. Such strings will be hard to swallow for many components.
Use Convert.ToBase64String and don't trust random articles on the web. Validate what you find with your own understanding before using it.

If you convert your 16-byte key to Base64, in javascript you can do the following. It will generate a WordArray as the key, and use that key to generate your hash.
var keyBase64 = ""eFY0EiMBZ0UBI0VniRI0Vg=="";

","I've just tested this quickly and if you set the file to be read-only, it does more or less what you want.
Create spreadsheet, save, set as read-only
Generate SHA-1 hash -> hash1

Open spreadsheet, edit, attempt save, receive warning about read-only copy, abort save, close without saving
Generate SHA-1 hash -> hash1 (i.e. same hash as before)

Turn off read-only flag, open, edit, save, undo edit, save, close
Generate SHA-1 hash -> hash2 (i.e. different hash from before)

So if you mark the file as read-only, this should allow people to view it without affecting the hash. If they turn the read-only flag off and open it, even if they do not make any changes, the hash will change.

openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 730 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.key -out certificate_pub.crt

Does anyone have any examples of how I could sign JWT with a SHA256 cert?
","With additional info, that private key file is PEM but NOT PKCS#8, as a modern version of OpenSSL should have created for req -newkey. And the difference between PEM and ""DER"" (binary) which standard Java requires is not just removing (and adding) the BEGIN and END lines.
Your simplest solution if OpenSSL is available is to convert both of these, without encrypting:
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -outform der -in private.pem -out good.der 

Then read good.der (use better name if you like) as bytes, and put that in PKCS8EncodedKeySpec and use it as you posted. Aside: you don't need to fiddle with DataInputStream, which isn't really intended for ""plain old"" bytes; java.nio.file.Files.readAllBytes can open, allocate, and read for you.
The next more complicated alternative is to convert to PKCS#8 but still PEM: same as about but omit -outform der (and use a file name that indicates PEM, to avoid confusion). Then in Java read that file as characters (with a Reader, usually BufferedReader, not a Stream), discard the BEGIN and END lines, concatenate all the lines between, and convert them from base64 to byte[]: in Java8 you have java.util.Base64, before that you can use javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter. 
To read the file you have in standard Java is harder. You could read the PEM-armored PKCS#1 and convert to binary PKCS#1, then ""wrap"" the PKCS#1 into PKCS#8 by building the DER encoding, but that's a good bit more complicated than what you've demonstrated familiarity with. Or you could parse the PKCS#1 and use the components to construct your own implemenation of RSAPrivateCrtKey and use that directly (no factory), ditto. 
The other alternative is to use the third-party library from http://www.BouncyCastle.org which has more flexible features for handling PEM files than standard Java. But you need to learn their API as well as the standard one, and if your program will run anywhere else you need to ensure BC is deployed with or as part of your program.

"6994263","Encryption: do I need to salt the key when not even storing it at all?","I searched all over the Net, including here on SO: There is a lot of discussion on the need to salt passwords before hashing and storing them.
In case the password is used to compute a key used for encryption (""Password Based Encryption""): what if you do not store the password at al?

[Note: I did read SO: Passphrase, Salt and IV, do I need all of these? and Does IV work like salt are certainly a related question: I am not sure how the Initialization Vector discussed there relates to the question here]

Suppose:
For encryption

the users enters a master password
this is SHA256 hashed and the output is used to AES256 encrypt a file
the hash is not stored (and obviously neither is the master password)

For decryption

The users enters the master password
This is SHA256 hashed and the output is used to decrypt the file
If the decryption was successful, the password was - apparently - correct

My question: 
When not storing anything except the encrypted file itself, is there any benefit in salting the master password before hashing it?
Considerations:

it would probably reduce the likelihood of a hash-collision
it would require the salt to be stored.
if the salt were lost/corrupted the user would not be able to decrypt the file anymore
how to check for successful decryption in step3: does this require part of the file contents to be known?
if so, how much of a faux-pas is storing a known value in an encrypted file (this cannot always be prevented - an attacker might guess that for example the users last name is encrypted somewhere in the file - an be correct).

","If you are not storing the master password then there is no need to salt it.  If you are reusing the master password to generate a lot of single-use passwords then it will need to be stored encrypted and decrypted as required.
Salting is for long term storing of user passwords that have to be matched more than once so that people with the same password don't have the same hash, which would help an attacker who stole the file.
Salt is for hashing in long term storage, an IV is for encryption using CBC mode (or CTR mode where it can also be called a nonce).
As to checking that your file has decrypted correctly, just ensure that you use a padding like PKCS7.  When the last block is decrypted the padding will be checked to ensure it is in the right format.  If the decryption failed then the padding will not be correctly formatted and you should get a ""Padding failed"" error.

","Generally when being displayed to a user the output of a hash is displayed encoded as a hexadecimal string, sometimes you might also see a Base64 string, but this is more rare.
The output of an MD5 hash is a 16 byte (128-bit) value . The full range of values a single byte can have can be shown as a two digit hexadecimal value. This hexadecimal value can range from 00 to FF which in decimal is 0 to 255 or perhaps more clearly in binary 00000000 to 11111111 (eight bits in a byte).
So 16 bytes can be represented as 32 hexadecimal digits without losing any information, and has the advantage of being easy to compare by visual inspection.
EDIT:
Another source of confusion may be in your premise that hashes work on alphanumeric data, which is incorrect. Hashes such as MD5 do not operate on strings, they operate on arbitrary data. 
When you hash a string it is hashed as data using an encoding such as UTF-8. For instance, the representation of hello in UTF-8 is 01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 in binary or 68 65 6C 6C 6F in hexadecimal. That number is the actual input to the hash.

","You need a crypto library for this. A well known one is Google CryptoJS.
I found this as an specific example for your task: https://gist.github.com/npcode/11282867
After including the crypto-js source:
function sha1sum() {
    var oFile = document.getElementById('uploadFile').files[0];
    var sha1 = CryptoJS.algo.SHA1.create();
    var read = 0;
    var unit = 1024 * 1024;

    var reader = new FileReader();
    reader.readAsArrayBuffer(oFile.slice(read, read + unit));
    reader.onload = function(e) {

            reader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob);

I wouldn't recommend to calculate a hash over the whole video file as it can be pretty resource consuming depending on the file size. Maybe you can use just the meta information or reconsider about the filename and filepath again?

","You are correct that SHA-512 returns a 64 byte value. However, in your database, you're storing a hexadecimal string representation of that 64 byte value, which requires twice as many bytes.
For example, consider the case when you have a single byte with a value of 255. As an unsigned integer, 255 can be stored in one byte, but the hexadecimal string representation (FF), requires 2 bytes.

Is there a C/C++ implementation to reverse SHA-1 by exploiting the weaknesses?
Is there a C/C++ implementation to reverse MD5 by exploiting the weakness?
My current feeling is that any approach to exploitation of the weakness will not have enough of a difference in time-complexity to demonstrate a benefit for such a small sample size.
","For a very detailed outline of a SHA-1 exploit, see
https://hashcat.net/p12/js-sha1exp_169.pdf
For such a small input sample, you can build an in-memory rainbow table of all possible input values and their hashes in milliseconds.  I doubt you would measure any significant difference using an exploit vs. brute force.  
Further, for such a small input range, collisions are extremely unlikely (therefore there will almost certainly be no collision pairs).

"44293192","Seeking information on hardware SHA-2 acceleration","This year AMD has released a new series of x86-64 CPUs named RyZen for desktop. RyZen's specification shows it provides new SSE based SHA1 and SHA-256 instructions wiki: Intel SHA extension:

sha1 instructions: SHA1RNDS4, SHA1NEXTE, SHA1MSG1, SHA1MSG2; 
sha-256 instructions: SHA256RNDS2, SHA256MSG1, SHA256MSG2

I am curious, Do any of the APIs/Libraries already exist that are able to laverage these instruction for ultra fast hashing to be used in PHP or other server side languages, when you use AMD RyZen CPU ? 
If not, when should we expect it to be available ?
Since Intel has provided specification for hardware SHA around year 2013, it seems at least a couple of compilers must have provied support for it.
","Support of hardware-accelerated SHA256 was added to openssl 1.0.2 [22 Jan 2015]:
https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=blob;f=CHANGES

1962  Changes between 1.0.1l and 1.0.2 [22 Jan 2015]

2012   *) Support for new and upcoming Intel processors, including AVX2,
2013      BMI and SHA ISA extensions. This includes additional ""stitched""
2014      implementations, AESNI-SHA256 and GCM, and multi-buffer support
2015      for TLS encrypt.


So, with enabled hardware and recent openssl, any php/python library which uses openssl to compute SHA256 may use hardware accelerated SHA256 digest computation (if enabled in the openssl and if this implementation will be selected by the library). And command-line too: openssl dgst -sha256 -binary file_to_be_hashed.
There are some raw bindings of openssl library in php: http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-digest.php and OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256 is there since PHP 5.5: which openssl version support for sha256 in php
Linux Kernel CryptoAPI may use hardware SHA1/SHA2 since 4.4 version: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-4.4-Crypto (http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1511.0/00383.html); but it is unlikely that PHP/other scripting library will use kernel cryptoapi.

","Yes. Byte values 128-255 are not part of any ASCII code units. ASCII has only 128 codepoints so it can't cover all 256 byte values no matter what the mapping is. 
But the real reason for using Base16 is so that all the characters are printable/visible and none of them are control characters (regardless of the character set and encoding) or quote characters used as literal string delimeters in programming languages and document formats. This lets them pass through many contexts as is, without breaking any rules of the context.
There are other ways of achieving that goal. One is Base64.

  return crypto.createHash('sha1').update(input).digest('hex');
};

But if i try to take hash of something cyrillic like this: ""ЭЮЯЁ"" they are not.
How to fix it?
","The issue is likely that the character set/encodings aren't matching.
If the string in PHP is UTF-8 encoded, you can mirror that in Node.js by specifying 'utf8':
function sha1(input) {
  return crypto.createHash('sha1').update(input, 'utf8').digest('hex');
};

> crypto.createHash('sha1').update('ЭЮЯЁ').digest('hex')

'f78c3521413a8321231e35665f8c4a16550e182a'

'ABC' will have a better chance of matching because these are all ASCII characters and ASCII is a starting point for many other character sets. It's when you get beyond ASCII that you'll more often run into conflicts.

Ive written a self contained example that creates public/private key, create a license by signing user emailaddress with public key, and then check using public key, license and email address that the license indeed was encoded using private key (Obviously this wouldn't all be in one class usually).
This all works but the hex version of the license key is 96 characters (i.e representing 48 bytes/384 bits) which  is a little longer than I wanted (In contrast the length of public/private keys is not a problem and the longer the better). What could I use to generate a 32 (64 hex chars) byte or maybe 16 byte (32 hex chars), and would the security of this be reasonable ?

KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""DSA"");

Signature.getInstance(""SHA/DSA"");

","@Paul - I think your solution here would be to use ECDSA.
Change your line of code 
final KeyPairGenerator keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""DSA"");

to
final KeyPairGenerator keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""ECDSA"");

The keys are much shorter than DSA - and I'm sure hex version signature would be shorter. I suggest you use a prime ECC curve of say 256 or 128 bits.
Please let us know if this solves the problem.

I am using sha1 encryption for encrypting my password,

Nope. SHA1 isn't encryption, it's a hash function. Understanding the difference between encrypting and hashing is crucial to implementing this safely:

Doing it right: use password_hash() and password_verify()
Doing it wrong: Encrypting with TripleDES-ECB

Also, the way you wrote your query leads me to believe it is vulnerable to SQL injection.

","No, there is nothing in a hash code that can tell you what algorithm was used to create it. Any strong hash code algorithm is specifically designed to not contain any traceable meta data in the hash code. There is no specific markers that identifies the hash code as being a hash code, or what kind of algorithm was used.
Basically a hash algorithm tries to create a strong pseuo-random number using all the input as seed. The output is just as random as possible, there are no recognisable patterns that could be used to identify the input data or the algorithm.
If you have the input data that was used to create the hash code, you could recreate it and compare the results. However, if just a single bit in the input is different you get a completely different hash code, so the input has to be exactly the same.

","Solution:
You need to use UTF-16LE encoding to get same SHA-256 Hash
p hash = Digest::SHA256.base64digest(""Hello"".encode('UTF-16LE'))

How did I find that?
I used Online C# Tool to create the hash of a string ""Hello"" using the code below:
using System.IO;
using System;
using System.Text;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        byte[] bytes = new UnicodeEncoding().GetBytes(""Hello"");
        String s =  Convert.ToBase64String(new SHA256Managed().ComputeHash(bytes));
        Console.WriteLine(s);
    }
}

Above program produced the output oH5Pc0MkbIKybzLlb4VBjVGNiy8trnfx1W/nr1Dbl68=
Then, I wrote a Ruby Program to compute Base64-encoded SHA-256 hash of string ""Hello"", by encoding the string in all the supported char encodings of Ruby to figure out which char encoding will give exact same result.
require ""digest/sha2""
require ""base64""
s = ""Hello""
Encoding.list.each { |e| puts ""Encoding: #{e.to_s} => Hash: #{Digest::SHA256.base64digest(s.encode(e)) rescue ""error""}""}

After running the program, I came to conclude that if you use UTF-16LE encoding, you will get exact same output.
p hash = Digest::SHA256.base64digest(""Hello"".encode('UTF-16LE'))

As per documentation of UnicodeEncoding, it:

Represents a UTF-16 encoding of Unicode characters.

","Start generating hashes from distinct messages1.
Eventually a hash will be generated with such a property. This is not that bad to brute-force as the range is only 224 (or ~16 million) and SHA is very fast.
There is no shortcut as SHA is a one way cryptographic hash function. In particular here, SHA has the property that ""it is infeasible to generate a message that has a given hash"".

1 The inputs should be distinct, and a simple counter will suffice. However, it may be more interesting to generate quasi-random messages based on the birthday being sought - e.g. including the date in various forms and sentences Mad Lib style. As long as this doesn't limit the domain, such that there is no qualifying hash, it'll work just as well as any other set of source messages.

and now you can bruteforce for your combination:
        string search = ""32"";
        string result = String.Empty;
        int slen = 5;
        string myTry = RandomString(slen);

        while (!result.EndsWith(search))
        {
            myTry = RandomString(slen);
            result = GetSHA1Hash(myTry);

        }

        MessageBox.Show(result + ""   "" + myTry);

This would search for a Hash String ending with 32. Happy Bruteforcing :)

","If you're playing around with tweaks to an algorithm, you shouldn't be using a built-in class implementing that algorithm. The class you mention is designed to implement standard algorithms for people who just want to use them in production; if you're using SHA-1 (or any cryptographic algorithm) instead of playing around and tweaking it, it's never a good idea to change the algorithm yourself (e.g. by changing the initial hash value), so the class does not support modifying those constants.
Just implement the algorithm yourself; from Wikipedia's pseudocode, it doesn't look like it's all that complicated. I know that ""don't implement your own crypto, use a standard and well-tested implementation"" is a common mantra here, but that only applies to production-type code -- if you're playing around with an algorithm to see what effect tweaking it has, you should implement it yourself, so you have more flexibility in modifying it and seeing the effect of the modifications.

","Basically adding to @Rahil's answer but too much for comments:
Even without API access, if MessageDigest were the implementation you could use reflection. But it's not. 
Most of the java standard library is just commonly-useful classes in the usual way, e.g. java.util.ArrayList contains the implementation of ArrayList (or ArrayList<?> since 6), java.io.FileInputStream contains the implementation of FileInputStream (although it may use other classes in that implementation), etc. Java Cryptography uses a more complicated scheme where the implementations are not in the API classes but instead in ""providers"" that are mostly in their own jars (in JRE/lib and JRE/lib/ext) not rt.jar and mostly(?) don't have source in src.zip. 
Thus the java.security.MessageDigest class does not have the code to implement SHA1, or SHA256, or MD5, etc etc. Instead it has code to search the JVM's current list of crypto providers to find an implementation of whatever algorithm is asked for, and instantiate and use that. Normally the list of providers used is set to (the list of) those included in the JRE distribution, although an admin or program can change it.
With the normal JRE7 providers, SHA1 is implemented by sun.security.provider.SHA.
In effect the API classes like MessageDigest Signature Cipher KeyGenerator etc function more like interfaces or facades by presenting the behavior that is common to possibly multiple underlying implementations, although in Java code terms they are actual classes and not interfaces.
This was designed back in 1990 or so to cope with legal restrictions on crypto in effect then, especially on export from the US. It allowed the base Java platform to be distributed easily because by itself it did no crypto. To use it -- and even if you don't do ""real"" crypto on user data in Java you still need things like verification of signed code -- you need to add some providers; you might have one set of providers, with complete and strong algorithms, used in US installations, and a different set, with fewer and weaker algorithms, used elsewhere. This capability is now much less needed since the US officially relaxed and in practice basically dropped enforcement about 2000, although there are periodically calls to bring it back. There is still one residual bit, however: JCE (in Oracle JREs) contains a policy that does not allow symmetric keys over 128 bits; to enable that you must download from the Oracle website and install an additional (tiny) file ""JCE Unlimited Strength Policy"".
TLDR: don't try to alter the JCE implementation. As @cpast says, in this case where you want to play with something different from the standard algorithm, do write your own code.

Also is the way I SHA the password correct?
","The problem is that your MySQL query is causing an error, which means that your $result doesn't actually contain a result resource.
You need to remove the '' from around SHA($password) in your query, and instead put them around the password value, like so:
$query=""SELECT username FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND password=SHA('$password')"";



Also is the way I SHA the password correct?

That depends on how the passwords were hashed when they were inserted into the database. MySQL's SHA() is the same as its SHA-1():

Calculates an SHA-1 160-bit checksum for the string, as described in RFC 3174

Which is also the same as PHP's sha1(); so, for example, if the passwords in the database are SHA-1 hashes that were created using PHP's sha1(), it should be fine.

Side Notes

You should use PHP's crypt() or hash() for hashing passwords, rather than SHA-1. For example usage, refer to the PHP documentation.
You should be cleaning/escaping all user-provided data before using any of it in a database query. This is to stop SQL injection attacks. Better yet, use prepared statements and parameterized queries. Refer to this answer for more information.

I want to check if anything has changed inside the product data, so I generate a hash from the product content and store it in a database. The next time the same product is loaded, I calculate the hash again, compare it to the one in the DB and decide wether the product needs an update or not.
","EDIT : As you detailed, two hashes with keys in different order should give the same string. I would reopen the Hash class to add my new custom flatten method :
class Hash
  def custom_flatten()
    self.sort.map{|pair| [""key: #{pair[0]}"", pair[1]]}.flatten.map{ |elem| elem.is_a?(Hash) ? elem.custom_flatten : elem }.flatten
  end
end

Explanation :

sort converts the hash to a sorted array of pairs (for the comparison of hashes with different keys order)
.map{|pair| [""key: #{pair[0]}"", pair[1]]} is a trick to differentiate keys from values in the final flatten array, to avoid the problem of {a: {b: {c: :d}}}.custom_flatten == {a: :b, c: :d}.custom_flatten
flatten converts an array of arrays into a single array of values
map{ |elem| elem.is_a?(Hash) ? elem.custom_flatten : elem } calls back fully_flatten on any sub-hash left.

Then you just need to use :
require 'digest/sha1'
Digest::SHA1.hexdigest hash.custom_flatten.to_s

","I am not aware of a gem that does something like what you are looking for. There is a Hash#flatten method in ruby, but it does not flatten nested hashes recursively. Here is a straight forward recursive function that will flatten in the way that you requested in your question:
def completely_flatten(hsh)
  hsh.flatten(-1).map{|el| el.is_a?(Hash) ? completely_flatten(el) : el}.flatten
end

This will yield
hash = {
  foo: ""test"",
  bar: [1,2,3]
  hello: {
    world: ""earth"",
    arrays: [
      {my: ""example""}
    ]
  }
}

completely_flatten(hash) 
#=> [:foo, ""test"", :bar, 1, 2, 3, :hello, :world, ""earth"", :arrays, :my, ""example""]

To get the string representation you are looking for (before making the sha1 hash) convert everything in the array to a string before sorting so that all of the elements can be meaningfully compared or else you will get an error:
hash_string = completely_flatten(hash).map(&:to_s).sort.join

","Use Marshal for Fast Serialization
You haven't articulated a useful reason to change your data structure before hashing. Therefore, you should consider marshaling for speed unless your data structures contain unsupported objects like bindings or procs. For example, using your hash variable with the syntax corrected:
require 'digest/sha1'

hash = {
  foo: ""test"",
  bar: [1,2,3],
  hello: {
    world: ""world"",
    arrays: [
      {foo: ""bar""}
    ]
  }
}
Digest::SHA1.hexdigest Marshal.dump(hash)
#=> ""f50bc3ceb514ae074a5ab9672ae5081251ae00ca""

Marshal is generally faster than other serialization options. If all you need is speed, that will be your best bet. However, you may find that JSON, YAML, or a simple #to_s or #inspect meet your needs better for other reasons. As long as you are comparing similar representations of your object, the internal format of the hashed object is largely irrelevant to ensuring you have a unique or unmodified object.

[:foo, ""test"", :bar, 1, 2, 3, :hello, :world, ""earth"", :arrays, :my, ""example""]

I would then sort the array, join it with array.join("""") and compute the sha1 hash like this:
require 'digest/sha1'
Digest::SHA1.hexdigest hash_string


How could I flatten the hash like I described above?
Is there already a gem for this?
Is there a quicker / easier way to solve this? I have a large amount of objects to convert (~700k), so performance does matter.

EDIT
Another problem that I figured out by the answers below are this two hashes:
a = {a: ""a"", b: ""b""}
b = {a: ""b"", b: ""a""}

When flattening the hash and sorting it, this two hashes produce the same output, even when a == b => false.
EDIT 2
The use case for this whole thing is product data comparison. The product data is stored inside a hash, then serialized and sent to a service that creates / updates the product data.
I want to check if anything has changed inside the product data, so I generate a hash from the product content and store it in a database. The next time the same product is loaded, I calculate the hash again, compare it to the one in the DB and decide wether the product needs an update or not.
","Any solution based on flattening the hash will fail for nested hashes. A robust solution is to explicitly sort the keys of each hash recursively (from ruby 1.9.x onwards, hash keys order is preserved), and then serialize it as a string and digest it.
  def canonize_hash(h)
    r = h.map { |k, v| [k, v.is_a?(Hash) ? canonize_hash(v) : v] }
    Hash[r.sort]
  end

  def digest_hash(hash)
    Digest::SHA1.hexdigest canonize_hash(hash).to_s

","The question is how to ""flatten"" a hash. There is a second, implicit, question concerning sha1, but, by SO rules, that needs to be addressed in a separate question. You can ""flatten"" any hash or array as follows.
Code
def crush(obj)
  recurse(obj).flatten
end

def recurse(obj)
  case obj
  when Array then obj.map { |e| recurse e }
  when Hash  then obj.map { |k,v| [k, recurse(v)] }
  else obj
  end
end

Example
crush({
  foo: ""test"",
  bar: [1,2,3],
  hello: {
    world: ""earth"",
    arrays: [{my: ""example""}]
  }
})
  #=> [:foo, ""test"", :bar, 1, 2, 3, :hello, :world, ""earth"", :arrays, :my, ""example""]

crush([[{ a:1, b:2 }, ""cat"", [3,4]], ""dog"", { c: [5,6] }])

"47017606","Is hashing really a irreversible process?","I've been using hash and RSA for a time(on a very superficial level, for ex: RSA authentication on a SSH connection), and I want to learn more about it.
To begin with, I know that encryption is a two-way process that can be reverted. And hashing is a one-way process that is irreversible.
That last point just doesn't make sense to me, if I use an algorithm to hash ""hello"", wouldn't the same algorithm, but ""reversed""(meaning, it works ""backwards""), be able to convert that hash to ""hello"" again.
EDIT:
Thanks to @GeorgDangl, @klutt, and Pete Kirkham for pointing out that I didn't understand at all the concept of ""irreversible math"". The examples were really helpful.
","It is irreversible in the sense that for each input you have exactly one output, but not the other way around. There are multiple inputs that yields the same output. 
For any given input, there's a lot (infinite in fact) different inputs that would yield the same hash. This is easy to realize since the output has a fixed size, but the input doesn't have size restrictions. 
To achieve this, irreversible math is used. For instance, it is easy to calculate 10%3. The answer to that is simply 10%3=1. But if I give you the equation x%3=1, what would you do? This equation is true for all x=3*k+1. Thus, you cannot get the number I started with. 
Another example of irreversible math is sine and cosine. For instance, cos(0)=1, but there are more input values that evaluates to 1. Actually, cos(n*2pi)=1. There are ""inverses"" to these functions, but they either gives an answer in a certain range or a multivalued answer. A third example is x²=1. This is true for both x=1 and x=-1. However, in this example you get a finite (and also rather small) number of possible answers.
When dealing with encryption, one could say that the private key is used to pick the right solution. You can always quite trivially decrypt an encrypted message, but you will get a huge load of possible answers. The key is used to find the right one, rather than actually decrypting.

","SHA is a hash, not an encryption. A hash does not include all of the information in the original and it's a one-way function. It's a signature of the original data, not a version of it.
So no, it can not be undone to retrieve the original.
The only option to 'reverse' would be to create guesses of the original and try to hash them and see if the result matches. Note that hashes aren't unique, so even if you got a match you couldn't 100% guarantee that it matched the original, only that it hashes to the same value.

SHA1: this is abstract class. All other implementation of SHA1
(SHA1CryptoServiceProvider, SHA1Managed and SHA1Cng) implements this
abstract class. To create concreate SHA1 class, use SHA1.Create().
By default SHA1.Create() returns SHA1CryptoServiceProvider, which is
configurable. To configure default SHA1 implementation:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/693aff9y.aspx
SHA1CryptoServiceProvider: this is wrapper for unmanaged
CryptoAPI(CAPI). This is Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIPS) certified.
SHA1Managed: this is complete implementation of SHA1 using managed
code. This is fully managed but not FIPS certified and may be
slower.
SHA1Cng: this is wrapper for unmanaged Cryptography Next Generation
(CNG). These are newer implementation of cryptographic algorithms by
Microsoft with Windows 2008/Windows Vista or newer. This is also
FIPS certified.

","You should redesign a bit how your app works:

First the servers sends to the client the file size.
The client reads the file size (converts it to a number) and notifies the server (sends ""OK"" to the server for example).
The server reads the ""OK"" from the client and starts to send the file contents (preferably in smaller chunks).
The client keeps reading data until either it reads exactly file size bytes or error occurs.
If no error occurred the client computes the hash of the file that it just received and sends it to the server.
The server reads the hash from client and compares with the one of its local file; if they match it sends ""OK"" to the client ""ERROR"" otherwise.
The client reads the response from server: if ""ERROR"" is received the file is deleted.

"7545431","Changing the hashing function on a pre-existing database","I'm doing a bit of reading on hashing for passwords.  I've seen that SHA-256 > MD5.
This got me thinking about how an app may deal with changing from one hashing function to another.  What happens if someone implements an app that hashes their passwords using MD5.  They then decide that SHA-256 is the way to go.  But of course the password hashes stored in the database are in MD5. 
What is the process for migrating the data in the database from one hashing function to another?
","It is not possible to ""unhash"" passwords (at least not in a general, efficient and reliable way -- you can guess some passwords, that's what attackers do, and you want to migrate from MD5 precisely because attackers may have some success at it). So the migration will be spread over time: some passwords will be hashed with MD5, other with SHA-256. When a password is to be verified:

If the SHA-256 of that password is known, SHA-256 is used. This password is already migrated.
Otherwise, MD5 is used to check the password. If it matches, then the password is good, and, since the password is known by the app at that time, the app also hashes the password with SHA-256 and replaces the MD5 hash with the SHA-256 hash in the database.

Thus, passwords are migrated dynamically; to get totally rid of MD5, you have to wait a long time and/or destroy accounts which have not been accessed for a long time. You need to be able to distinguish a MD5 hash from a SHA-256 hash, which is easy since they have distinct sizes (16 bytes for MD5, 32 bytes for SHA-256). YOu could also add a flag or any other similar gimmick.
Please note that hashing passwords with a raw single application of a hash function is a pretty lousy way of doing it, security-wise, and replacing MD5 with SHA-256 will not really improve things. You hash passwords so that an attacker who gains read access to the database will not learn the passwords themselves. To really prevent the attacker from guessing the passwords, you also need ""salts"" (per-password random data, stored alongside the hashed password) and a suitably slow hash function (i.e. thousands, possibly millions, of nested hash function invocations). See this answer for details. The short answer: since you are envisioning migration, do the smart thing and migrate to bcrypt, not SHA-256 (see that answer on security.stackexchange).

","As for the second part of the question:
In the Crypto++ Pipelining system, filters and sinks are owned by the object they are attached to. They are automatically deleted by the destructor of that object.
And from ""Important Usage Notes"" in ReadMe.txt:

If a constructor for A takes a pointer to an object B (except primitive types such as int and char), then A owns B and will delete B at A's destruction. If a constructor for A takes a reference to an object B, then the caller retains ownership of B and should not destroy it until A no longer needs it.

"19988785","Which is preferable: sha1_file(f) or sha1(file_get_contents(f))?","I want to create a hash of a file which size minimum 5Mb and can extend to 1-2 Gb. Now tough choice arise in between these two methods although they work exactly same.
Method 1: sha1_file($file)
Method 2: sha1(file_get_contents($file))

I have tried with 10 Mb but there is no much difference in performance.
But on higher data scale. What's better way to go?
","Use the most high-level form offered unless there is a compelling reason otherwise.
In this case, the correct choice is sha1_file. Because sha1_file is a higher-level function that only works with files. This 'restriction' allows it to take advantage of the fact that the file/source can be processed as a stream1: only a small part of the file is ever read into memory at a time.
The second approach guarantees that 5MB-2GB of memory (the size of the file) is wasted/used as file_get_contents reads everything into memory before the hash is generated. As the size of the files increase and/or system resources become limited this can have a very detrimental effect on performance.

1 The source for sha1_file can be found on github. Here is an extract showing only lines relevant to stream processing:
PHP_FUNCTION(sha1_file)
{       
    stream = php_stream_open_wrapper(arg, ""rb"", REPORT_ERRORS, NULL);
    PHP_SHA1Init(&context);    
    while ((n = php_stream_read(stream, buf, sizeof(buf))) > 0) {
        PHP_SHA1Update(&context, buf, n);
    }    
    PHP_SHA1Final(digest, &context);    
    php_stream_close(stream);
}

By using higher-level functions, the onus of a suitable implementation is placed on the developers of the library. In this case it allowed the use of a scaling stream implementation.

I'm guessing this is why they're asking you to hash 60000 time. To add a work factor and slow down brute force attacks.

Something like this:

Verification of Hashing password is not working
","To me this looks like an attempt to reimplement a PBKDF2 algorithm, to get a cost factor.
Usually it is not recommended to make experiments with security functions, instead one should use a proven well tested algorithm. Your concern about the algorithm above is justified, try to convince your team to switch to BCrypt.Net or to PBKDF2.
When you go for PBKDF2, then you can either use the built in dotnet class Rfc2898DeriveBytes to calculate a PBKDF2 with HMACSHA1 (which is the standard even today), or you can use an implementation which supports other hash functions like PBKDF2 with SHA-256.

","You changed the type of the object you wrote the hash with.
From git hash-object
-t <type>

    Specify the type (default: ""blob"").

You went from the default blob to commit.
And the object actually written start with the object type, which is part of what the sha1 has to compute.
See:

""Why does git hash-object return a different hash than openssl sha1?""
""Assigning Git SHA1's without Git""


Git calculates the SHA1 for a file (or, in Git terms, a ""blob""):

sha1(""blob "" + filesize + ""\0"" + data)

That changes the content of what is taken into account by the sha1.
With -t commit, you modify that prefix (it is no longer 'blob'), and since the content is different, the sha1 is also different.
You can do a: 
python -c ""import zlib,sys;print repr(zlib.decompress(sys.stdin.read()))"" < .git/objects/02/b365d4af3ef6f74b0b1f18c41507c82b3ee571:

I have written a program for Android and Windows both that calculates the SHA1 hash of a given image.  I confirmed these hashes with HashCalc that I downloaded.  However when I try to do the same for iPhone I get a completely different hash.  I believe it has something to do with converting the image to a byte array before I compute the hash.

UIImage *image = [info objectForKey:UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage];

}

","I suspect the problem here is that you're converting the data using UIImageJPEGRepresentation(). Even if you started with JPEG data, there isn't a promise that this returns exactly the same bytes as you started with.
My (untested) suggestion is that you ask the CGDataProvider for the raw data. Something like this:
CGImageRef cgImage = [image CGImage];
CGDataProviderRef provider = CGImageGetDataProvider(cgImage);
CFDataRef imageData = CGDataProviderCopyData(provider);

The way to obtain a pESN from MEID is fairly simple in theory. For example, given MEID 0xA0000000002329, to make a pESN, SHA-1 needs to be applied to the MEID. SHA-1 on A0000000002329 gives e3be267a2cd5c861f3c7ea4224df829a3551f1ab. Take the last 6 hex numbers of this result, and append it to 0x80 - the result is 0x8051F1AB.
Now here is the code I have so far:
public void sha1() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {

    String hexMEID = ""A0000000002329"";

    MessageDigest mDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA1"");      
    byte[] b = new BigInteger(hexMEID,16).toByteArray();    

    byte[] result = mDigest.digest(b);
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

    for (int i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {
        sb.append(Integer.toString((result[i] & 0xff) + 0x100, 16).substring(1));
    }

    System.out.println(sb.toString());
}

The problem is that using this method, SHA-1 on A0000000002329 gives 6ad447f040941bf43c0693d2b391c6c79fa58320 instead of e3be267a2cd5c861f3c7ea4224df829a3551f1ab. What am I doing wrong here??

  the string representing the MEID. You'll need to process it
  byte-by-byte, so you must give it two hex numbers at a time (since two
  hex numbers make a byte) and make sure they are interpreted as numbers
  and not ASCII characters.

If these instructions are true, then how do I apply SHA-1 to my hex number byte by byte??
","You have a tiny little issue which is the consequence of using BigInteger to get your byte array. Since the MEID is only 7 bytes long, when you pump it through the BigInteger, you will get a byte array of length 8 because the BigInteger outputs the exta byte which holds the sign. This extra byte causes the SHA-1 hash of your input to be completely different, of course. You need to strip it off. 
So here is what the HEX MEID to ESN code will look like:
String hexMEID = ""A0000000002329"";
MessageDigest mDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance( ""SHA1"" );

byte[] input = new byte[ 7 ]; // MEIDs are only 7 bytes

// Now copy the bytes from BigInteger skipping the extra byte added by it
System.arraycopy( new BigInteger( hexMEID, 16 ).toByteArray(), 1, input, 0, 7 );

// Get the SHA-1 bytes
byte[] result = mDigest.digest( input );

// Build the SHA-1 String
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
for ( int i = 0; i < result.length; i++ )
{
    String hex = Integer.toHexString( 0xFF & result[ i ] );
    if ( hex.length() == 1 )
    {
        sb.append( '0' );
    }
    sb.append( hex );
}

String sha1 = sb.toString();
// Grab the last 6 characters of the SHA-1 hash
String lastSix = sha1.substring( sha1.length() - 6 );
// And prepend '80', now you have the ESN
System.out.println( ""80"" + lastSix );
// Will print 8051f1ab which is exactly what you want

"11838825","How do I apply SHA-1 to a large hex number byte by byte?","I'm trying to create a program that will enable me to convert a MEID (a hex number of length 14) to pseudo ESN (a hex number of length 8). The way to obtain a pESN from MEID is fairly simple in theory. For example, given MEID 0xA0000000002329, to make a pESN, SHA-1 needs to be applied to the MEID. SHA-1 on A0000000002329 gives e3be267a2cd5c861f3c7ea4224df829a3551f1ab. Take the last 6 hex numbers of this result, and append it to 0x80 - the result is 0x8051F1AB.
Now here is the code I have so far:
public void sha1() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {

    String hexMEID = ""A0000000002329"";

    MessageDigest mDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA1"");      
    byte[] b = new BigInteger(hexMEID,16).toByteArray();    

    byte[] result = mDigest.digest(b);
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

    for (int i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {
        sb.append(Integer.toString((result[i] & 0xff) + 0x100, 16).substring(1));
    }

    System.out.println(sb.toString());
}

The problem is that using this method, SHA-1 on A0000000002329 gives 6ad447f040941bf43c0693d2b391c6c79fa58320 instead of e3be267a2cd5c861f3c7ea4224df829a3551f1ab. What am I doing wrong here??

","Strelok has found the problem about BigInteger adding an extra byte in the returned array. This simpler version also gives the expected result :
String hexMEID = ""A0000000002329"";

MessageDigest mDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA1"");

byte[] b = new BigInteger(hexMEID,16).toByteArray();

// skip the first byte set by BigInteger and retain only 7 bytes (length of MEID)
byte[] result = mDigest.digest(Arrays.copyOfRange(b, 1, 8));

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(""80"");

// need only the last 3 bytes
for (int i=17; i<20; i++) {
    sb.append(Integer.toHexString((result[i] & 0xff) | 0x100).substring(1));
}

String pESN = sb.toString();
System.out.println(pESN);
// -> 8051f1ab

","From the docs:

The hash you get back isn't a string yet. It's a WordArray object. When you use a WordArray object in a string context, it's automatically converted to a hex string.

When you compare objects in JavaScript you are testing to see if they are the same object, not if they are identical objects.
Since you have created two WordArrays, you are comparing two different (but probably identical) objects.
You need to convert them to strings.
if ( (''+c1) == (''+c2) ) 

or
if ( c1.toString() == c2.toString() )

","You have at least two ways to create unique identifiers:

Use incremental value, usually integer, to generate unique key
Use eg. UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)

Incremental identifiers
The first choice is obvious: whether you do it on the database layer or on the application layer, you need to store information on which identifier was generated last, so you can generate another by incrementing it.
Example solution is here:
>>> class Incremental(object):
    _last_id = 0
    def __init__(self):
        Incremental._last_id += 1
        self.id = Incremental._last_id


>>> class MyClass(Incremental):
    def __repr__(self):
        return 'MyClass with id=%s' % self.id


>>> a = MyClass()
>>> b = MyClass()
>>> c = MyClass()
>>> a, b, c
(MyClass with id=1, MyClass with id=2, MyClass with id=3)

Although take a look at what others proposed - their proposals may be better suited when it comes to incremental IDs.
Universally Unique Identifiers
The second choice is just using proper tool for proper task: UUID is specifically designed to give you unique identifier.
There is a module called UUID bundled with standard Python installation that you can use for this:
>>> import uuid
>>> str(uuid.uuid1())
'0baa65ea-b665-11e1-b721-b80305056d6a'

Translating them into hashes
You can translate both values to SHA-1 hashes, if you wish:
>>> import hashlib
>>> hashlib.sha1(str(1)).hexdigest()
'356a192b7913b04c54574d18c28d46e6395428ab'
>>> hashlib.sha1('0baa65ea-b665-11e1-b721-b80305056d6a').hexdigest()

"50038666","How to convert a crypto::sha2::Sha256 hash into a &[u8] representation?","I'm currently trying to generate an ED25519 keypair from a SHA256 hash (via rust-crypto crate):
extern crate crypto; // rust-crypto = ""0.2.36""

use crypto::ed25519;
use crypto::sha2::Sha256;
use crypto::digest::Digest;

fn main() {
    let phrase = ""purchase hobby popular celery evil fantasy someone party position gossip host gather"";
    let mut seed = Sha256::new();
    seed.input_str(&phrase);
    let (_priv, _publ) = ed25519::keypair(&seed); // expects slice
}

However, I totally fail to understand how to correctly pass the SHA256 to the ed25519::keypair() function. I traced down that &seed.result_str() results in:
""fc37862cb425ca4368e8e368c54bb6ea0a1f305a225978564d1bdabdc7d99bdb""

This is the correct hash, while &seed.result_str().as_bytes() results in:
[102, 99, 51, 55, 56, 54, 50, 99, 98, 52, 50, 53, 99, 97, 52, 51, 54, 56, 101, 56, 101, 51, 54, 56, 99, 53, 52, 98, 98, 54, 101, 97, 48, 97, 49, 102, 51, 48, 53, 97, 50, 50, 53, 57, 55, 56, 53, 54, 52, 100, 49, 98, 100, 97, 98, 100, 99, 55, 100, 57, 57, 98, 100, 98]

Which is something I do not want, something entirely different. The question now breaks down to:
   |
36 |     let (_priv, _publ) = ed25519::keypair(&seed);
   |                                           ^^^^^ expected slice, found struct `crypto::sha2::Sha256`
   |
   = note: expected type `&[u8]`
              found type `&crypto::sha2::Sha256`

How to correctly convert the crypto::sha2::Sha256 hash into a [u8] representation?
","The Sha256 API may be a little confusing at first because it is designed so that it doesn't allocate any new memory for the data. That's to avoid wasting a memory allocation, in case you want to allocate it yourself. Instead, you give it a buffer to write to:
// Create a buffer in which to write the bytes, making sure it's
// big enough for the size of the hash
let mut bytes = vec![0; seed.output_bytes()];
// Write the raw bytes from the hash into the buffer
seed.result(&mut bytes);

// A reference to a Vec can be coerced to a slice
let (_priv, _publ) = ed25519::keypair(&bytes);

","When doing HMAC or other cryptographic functions, you should build up some fundamental methods/functions that don't deal with strings first. Then you can create wrapper methods that decode/encode string data or digests in a convenient way.

(Note: this code is not tested, just hacked together in a text editor)
Don't worry about the string representation of your key or data. Then you can go from there, e.g. getting the base64 encoding of the digest.
Cryptographic functions DO NOT CARE about strings or text encodings. They care about bytes. Strings (in C, since they are null-terminated) are a mere subset of what can be represented in data. So it would be severely limiting to deal with strings.

AFAIK the only way a hash can be different is due to a random salt, but according to the documentation I'm disabling salts by setting the salt size to 0.
public static void main(String[] args ) {
    char[] password = ""test_pass"".toCharArray();
    String str = encodePassword(password);

    System.out.printf(

    );

{
    digester.setAlgorithm(""SHA-256"");
    digester.setIterations(100000);
    digester.setSaltSizeBytes(0);
    digester.initialize();
}

    return new String(Base64.encodeBase64(digester.digest(toBytes(rawPass))));
}

public static byte[] toBytes(char[] ch) { 
    Charset charset = Charset.defaultCharset();
    ByteBuffer buff = charset.encode(CharBuffer.wrap(ch));
    byte[] tmp = new byte[buff.limit()];
    buff.get(tmp);
    return tmp;    
}

","Your bug is related to the fact that you initialize your static field StandardByteDigester digester in an instance initializer block instead of a static initializer bloc such that it is never called as you never create an instance of your class so at the end it uses the default configuration with random salt.
Try this:
static {
    digester.setAlgorithm(""SHA-256"");
    digester.setIterations(100000);
    digester.setSaltSizeBytes(0);
    digester.initialize();
}


Your code could be simplified if your method encodePassword took a String instead of a char array as you could simply call getBytes(Charset) as next:
public static String encodePassword(String rawPass) {
    return new String(
        Base64.encodeBase64(digester.digest(rawPass.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8))),
        StandardCharsets.US_ASCII
    );
}

NB: It is not a good practice to rely on the platform's default charset as your code would then be platform's dependent so here as base 64 characters are all included in US_ASCII, let's use this charset to decode.

","My guess is that the scm plugin parses the build log after the build run to extract the revision data. If you use the Multiple SCM plugin, a Jenkins Pipeline with multiple git or checkout commands or a Jenkins Shared Library it is very well possible to end up with multiple scm revisions from multiple repositories (we currently have 6 in our of jobs...).
I don't know if it is possible to ignore parts of the log for the SCM revision parsing, otherwise you'll have to do some filtering on your side of the request. If the different revisions happen in order in the log, then you can choose to always discard the first or second one.

","No, that won't work. But, given that all three of those types inherit from System.Security.Cryptography.HashAlgorithm, you could declare the variable of that type:

}

Edit
Just to add, the reason that var shaHash; will not work is because that var is just a shorthand way of saying ""I'm not sure of the best type to use here, so please infer it for me"". The compiler requires that you specify an initial value so that it can determine the best type to use.

","Not without resorting to dynamic; you need to use inheritance or interfaces for this.

Otherwise, you could create adapter classes with a common superclass and wrap the SHA objects in the adapters.

","If you have a parent class in which you declare a type, and 3 other classes which inherit after the parent class (children), then you can create a method which would be declared as returning the parent type, but inside you would return each of the child types. 
This will work and compile as the parent type will be automatically casted on to a child type.
It will not work the other way round however (you cannot cast a type from a child to parent).

","Short answer
It seems your SHA-256 hash algorithm implementation done in the Swift language is correct.
Long answer
The Java example you are referring to does not just contain the SHA-256 hash algorithm implementation, but also contains the HMAC-SHA-512 algorithm implementation to calculate the signature (?).
All in all, if there is a need of the SHA-256 algorithm only, please check the following draft Java implementation:

        // Output.

"48998952","C# RSACryptoServiceProvider - JWT RS256 Validation Fails","(I've already been thru a lot of Stackoverflow/google results trying to find a fix for this.)
I am validating JWTs signed with RS256 using the default C# JwtSecurityTokenHandler. In some cases, the validation fails when it shouldn't. Concretely, tokens from a given Authorization Server validate properly while tokens form another Authorization Server won't.
BUT... Using the same JWTs and RSA Certificates on JWT.IO validates ALL the tokens succesfully. This is the part that makes me believe that there's something wrong/unusual in the C# implementation. I am also able to validate the same JWTs using the same Certificates using the oidc-client JavaScript library. The one place where the validation sometimes fails is in C#.
I traced the error down to JwtSecurityTokenHandler's ValidateSignature method. Searching the original github code and googling about RSA, I came down with this bare-bone method which allows me to reproduce the problem in a plain console app:
static void ValidateJWT(string token, string modulus, string exponent)
{
    string tokenStr = token;
    JwtSecurityToken st = new JwtSecurityToken(tokenStr);
    string[] tokenParts = tokenStr.Split('.');

    RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();
    rsa.ImportParameters(
        new RSAParameters()
        {
            Modulus = FromBase64Url(modulus),
            Exponent = FromBase64Url(exponent)
        });

    SHA256 sha256 = SHA256.Create();
    byte[] hash = sha256.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(tokenParts[0] + '.' + tokenParts[1]));

    RSAPKCS1SignatureDeformatter rsaDeformatter = new RSAPKCS1SignatureDeformatter(rsa);
    rsaDeformatter.SetHashAlgorithm(""SHA256"");

    var valid = rsaDeformatter.VerifySignature(hash, FromBase64Url(tokenParts[2]));
    Console.WriteLine(valid); // sometimes false when it should be true
}

private static byte[] FromBase64Url(string base64Url)
{
    string padded = base64Url.Length % 4 == 0
        ? base64Url : base64Url + ""===="".Substring(base64Url.Length % 4);
    string base64 = padded.Replace(""_"", ""/"")
                            .Replace(""-"", ""+"");
    return Convert.FromBase64String(base64);
}

It is from that RSACryptoServiceProvider and using RSAKeys from here (https://gist.github.com/therightstuff/aa65356e95f8d0aae888e9f61aa29414) that I was able to Export the Public Key that allows me to validate JWTs successfully on JWT.IO.
string publicKey = RSAKeys.ExportPublicKey(rsa);

I can't provide actual JWTs to this post (they expire anyways), but does anyone knows of a crypto behavior specific to C# that could explain these validation errors, which don't happen in JavaScript nor on JWT.IO ?
And if so, any solution for this?
Thanks,
Martin
","https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-6.3.1.1

Note that implementers have found that some cryptographic libraries
     prefix an extra zero-valued octet to the modulus representations they
     return, for instance, returning 257 octets for a 2048-bit key, rather
     than 256.  Implementations using such libraries will need to take
     care to omit the extra octet from the base64url-encoded
     representation.

In the case of one of the tokens you provided on a copy of this issue elsewhere, the decode of the modulus includes a prefixed 0x00 byte.  This causes downstream problems.  But you can fix their non-conformance.
byte[] modulusBytes = FromBase64Url(modulus);

if (modulusBytes[0] == 0)
{
    byte[] tmp = new byte[modulusBytes.Length - 1];
    Buffer.BlockCopy(modulusBytes, 1, tmp, 0, tmp.Length);
    modulusBytes = tmp;
}

It looks like RS256 treats the signature as opaque bytes, so it will encode it as-is.  So you probably don't need this correction (though it's where my investigation started):
byte[] sig = FromBase64Url(tokenParts[2]);

if (sig.Length < modulusBytes.Length)
{
    byte[] tmp = new byte[modulusBytes.Length];
    Buffer.BlockCopy(sig, 0, tmp, tmp.Length - sig.Length, sig.Length);
    sig = tmp;
}

Openssl does not support Zeros Padding out of the box but you can do this yourself by telling Openssl not to pad the data and ensuring the data is a multiple of the block size by adding ‘/0’ characters at the end of the data.

","The answer to the second question is yes (it is impossible, etc).
The first question is not as well formed as I think you might want, because a commit hash is in fact just based on the commit data.  The key that causes the second question's answer is that ""the commit data"" includes these key items, which you can see in an actual commit:

The tree line gives the hash of the tree (which depends only on the tree contents) and the parent lines—two, in this case, as HEAD is a merge commit—give the hashes of the parent commits.  Given that the hash of the current commit depends on the hash(es) of its tree and parent(s), if you were to construct a different repo with a different history or different tree, those would have different hashes so that the commit would also have a different hash.

Here, You can see in MD5 & SHA-0, on both possible collisions are found.
Can anyone explain if it is possible to have both collisions at the same?
I have got some example for MD5 Collisions. It would be better if someone can provide an example for MD5 & SHA-0 Collision both at the same?
","Collisions are possible in all hashes, it is a mathematical certainty. The reason it happens is called the Pigeonhole Principle, what it means is you only have X possible values for the hash to have, once you hash X+1 items, you are guaranteed to have a collision because you must have used every hash value at least once making the X+1 item you hash a guaranteed collision.
Now, apply this logic to MD5 and SHA1. Pretend you have a very long hash which is just the MD5 hash (2^128 possible hashes) concatenated  on to the SHA1 hash (2^160 possible hashes). You still have only have 2^128 * 2^160 possible hashes, once you hash 2^128 * 2^160 + 1 items you are guaranteed to have a item that had a collision in MD5 and a collision in SHA1 at the same time.
Would such a hash be easily found so that you could do a second-preimage attack so you could replace a existing hashed file with a 2nd one that had a matching hash? No, that attack would likely be unfeasible on the non-government level.

","
While submitting a form's data,the password is visible in encrypted format inside the form data and also in the parameters of the POST request

Indeed, the browser shows you all data that has been posted. Effectively the request has been done on behalve of user and you have to assume the user can see all information he/she has posted. 

I want to hide the password in the encrypted format. 
  just to change the protocol to https from http

Yes, this is the correct answer, https ensures the traffic is encrypted and server authenticated and anybody sniffing out the traffic would be unable to decrypt any of posted data. What you see in the browser are data before encryption and actual transmission.

I am using sha-512 for encryption 

Nope, seems you just hashed some data (please search and learn the difference between encryption and hashing), now the hash has became the password, now you need to protect the hash.

CWE-204

Nothing you've shown indicates the CWE-204 vulnerability. What you've shown is a normal post request and response with a session cookie and redirect url. Your system may or may not have the CWE-204 vulnerability, though it has nothing to do with the data you've provided.

Please help me how to solve this issue of hiding the form data from showing the password in the POST request header parameters

Now there's a question:
Is the password provided by the user and do you want to hide the password from any 3rd party (potentially sniffing out the traffic)? Then using https will do the trick. The user may still see the posted data (including the password), but well - the user provided the password, he knows it already.
If the ""password"" some system parameter you want to pass in the form without the user able to know it? In theory - you may encrypt the password on the server-side and decrypt the password on the target system. However - the user may just post the encrypted password again. Then you may rather use time-limited JWT token.

"48081688","In Python, represent a SHA-256 hash using the fewest characters possible","What is the most dense way (fewest characters) that I can store a complete SHA-256 hash? 
","Charles' answer is absolutely correct. However, I'm assuming that you don't want with the shortest binary encoding of the SHA256 bash - the 32-octet string - and want something printable and somewhat human-readable.
Note: However, this does not exactly apply to barcodes. At least QR codes encode binary data, so just use digest() method of your hash - that would be the most efficient encoding you can use there. Your QR code generation library should most likely support generating codes for ""raw"" binary strings - check your library docs and find the correct method/invocation.
SHA hashes (and other hashes) don't produce or operate on characters, they work with binary data. SHA-256 produces 256 bits of data, commonly represented with 32 bytes. In particular, in Python 3 you should notice that hashlib.sha256(""..."").digest() returns bytes and not str.
There is a convenience method hexdigest, that produces hexadecimal (base16) string that represents those bytes. You can use base32, base58, base64, baseEmoji or any other encoding that fits your requirements.
Basically, your problem is actually ""I have a number and want a short encoding of it"". Decide on how many distinct characters you can use (encoding base) and use that. There are many libraries on PyPI that could help. python-baseconv may come handy.

I am working on a file parsing application and there is a file entity in the DB with descendants and, in order to have a more compact foreign/primary key than the fully qualified path to a file, I would like to convert it into the shortest possible unique digest as possible.
What are my options to do this?  Can I use SHA?
How about if i just took an MD5 checksum out of the fully qualified path string and got something like 1736622845? On a command line, it can be done with 
echo -n '/my/path/filename' | cksum | cut -d' ' -f1 

Is that guaranteed to never repeat for two different inputs?  If yes, how would I translate the above bash piped command into pure Python so that I don't have to invoke a system call but get the same value?
","The shortest possible unique ID of a string is the string. 
You can try to use an alphabet that only contains the characters allowed in the path, so that you use less bits (a lot of work, not a lot of benefit, unless your paths really only contain a few characters)
What I think you want is a fairly good short hash function. As soon as you generate a hash function there's a risk of collision. For most hash functions a good rule of thumb is that you have far less entries than the hash value space. There's a theorem to prove that as soon as you have more than sqrt(key_space) entries you will (with the best hashes) get collisions half the time.
So if you take say 1000 paths, you should aim at having a hash pace of at least 1.000.000 entries to work with. You can chop up other hash functions (say take only the first 2 bytes of the md5). That should work, but note the increase in collisions (where 2 entries will generate the same value).
Also if you are so keen to save space, store the hash value in binary (large int). It's far shorter than the the usual encodings (base64, or hex) and all the DB functions should work fine.
So say you take md5 and store it as a large int, it will take only 16 bytes to store. But you can also only use 8 or 4 (I wouldn't dare go lower than that).

"16222197",".Net chatroom hash (eStreamChat)","I have a question specific to eStreamChat (An opensource Chatroom for .Net). There doesn't seem to be much in the way of documentation on their websites or any examples online so if anyone could help that would be great. I think that the problem is with my hash.
So far I have managed to download and import the project and set up a virtual IIS directory so that I can use it from my own application. I have created a link on one of my own webpages that brings me to their ChatRoom.aspx webpage. The link that brings me there is in the required format eg:
http://localhost:10833/eStreamChat/ChatRoom.aspx?id=lowens&timestamp=130425080917&hash=eb9fa849033cbf7b967ba472efb46363903f96dc

The page loads and I can see the chatroom but I get the following error popup: Unable to join room! Hash is invalid!
To get this far I have followed the instructions on this page: 
The only line I didn't understand was this: You can configure the secret key from the web.config file so maybe if somebody could explain what I'm supposed to be doing in the web.config it might help.
The error that is being thrown is from the RemoteAuthUserProvider.cs. Here is the code:
NameValueCollection hrefParams = HttpUtility.ParseQueryString(hrefUri.Query);

var calculatedHash = Miscellaneous.CalculateChatAuthHash(hrefParams[""id""] ?? String.Empty,
                hrefParams[""target""] ?? String.Empty, hrefParams[""timestamp""]);

if (hrefParams[""hash""] != calculatedHash)
{
    throw new SecurityException(""Hash is invalid!"");
}

After debugging:
hrefParams[""hash""] is ""eb9fa849033cbf7b967ba472efb46363903f96dc"" this is 
calculatedHash is ""5129cf1cf65350a387ce53a2b0d31c960f9d96d3""
So why is that hash not the same?
Cheers

","
As for question 1 I'm not quite sure but it seems to be OK.
For question 2: It is never OK to have same salt for all users. Salt has two functions. To prevent using pre-generated hashes / rainbow tables to search leaked database, and to prevent generation of dictionary-based hashes and searching databases with them too. Common salt will work in first case making rainbow tables unusable, but won't prevent cracker from dictionary attack. If cracker knows the global salt, he can generate frequent passwords, hash them and grep entire database. If salt is generated per user this scenario isn't possible.

It's not a good idea to keep md5, read this question: Use SHA-512 and salt to hash an MD5 hashed password?.
It's better to have one salt for each user. With the same salt, users with the same password will have the same hash, and a rainbow table can be created for all your passwords at the same time.

Each of this is computed using the SHA-256 hash of 3 distinct inputs.
First, is the server seed. This is a precomputed value generated some time in the past. Seeds are generated in a chain such that today's seed is the hash of tomorrow's seed.
seed 0 => seed 1 => seed 2 => seed 3
Next, the server seed is salted (scrambled) with the results of the New York Lottery's Take 5 game. Drawn daily at 11:21 pm EST, these results (0-padded) are appended to the server seed for use the following day.
Finally, each roll is salted with the unique round id ensuring a different hash each roll.
The round's hash is generated using SHA256(""serverseed-lottery-roundid""). Taking the first 8 hex digits of the resulting hash and converting to decimal yields an integer from 0-4294967295. Taking modulo 15 yields the final roll in the range 0-14.
And i add you few examples with these seeds and salts chronologically:
Seeds:
1# 08659e6ef7759d68c4a4d8b214217394c5f2b1a539cc51cc5f89be1f55ab737b

","Hash algorithms are taking a bunch of bytes, calculate the hash and return a predefined number of bytes. So it doesn't matter to them, if the input is a short encoded text or a large binary file.
It depends on the implementation of the hash function and of the programming environment, how the string is converted to a byte array. As long as it is always done the same way, the hashes will be comparable. If you need a cross-platform hash, it is a good idea to first convert the string to a byte array (preferably UTF-8 encoded) and then feeding it to the hash.
The output is often a hexadecimal representation of the hash, but sometimes you can also request the binary output.
Example with SHA-256
SHA256(""hello"") = ""2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824""


Returns 32 bytes which is the same as 256 bits, thus the name SHA-256.
The 32 bytes are hex encoded, every byte is represented as hexadecimal number with two characters (2c stands for one byte with the number 44).

"39098358","Creating same hashes like symfony2 does with java (SHA-512)","I have an old Symfony2 based application here and I am developing a replacement with Dropwizard in Java.
I migrated all User records from old DB into my new Datamodel.
I also added new fields for passwords and imported the old password and salt fields, too.
Now I want to make the well known procedure. Let the user login, try against new password field. If it fails try the migrated ones, if they work, encode the cleartext password with the new algorithm and store the new hash in the new pasword field. So that the users are porting there password hashes from old procedure to the new one.
Sounds simple and normaly it's work as usual, but this Symfony and PHP drives me crazy.
Where I stuck is to create the same hash with java as symfony does.
The old application uses the MessageDigestPasswordEncoder with ""sha512"", base64 encoding and 5000 iterations, all defaults ;)
The important methods are:
MessageDigestPasswordEncoder:
public function encodePassword($raw, $salt) {
  if ($this->isPasswordTooLong($raw)) {
    throw new BadCredentialsException('Invalid password.');
  }

  if (!in_array($this->algorithm, hash_algos(), true)) {
    throw new \LogicException(sprintf('The algorithm ""%s"" is not supported.', $this->algorithm));
  }

  $salted = $this->mergePasswordAndSalt($raw, $salt);
  $digest = hash($this->algorithm, $salted, true);

  // ""stretch"" hash
  for ($i = 1; $i < $this->iterations; ++$i) {
    $digest = hash($this->algorithm, $digest.$salted, true);
  }

  return $this->encodeHashAsBase64 ? base64_encode($digest) : bin2hex($digest);
}

And BasePasswordEncoder:
protected function mergePasswordAndSalt($password, $salt) {
  if (empty($salt)) {
    return $password;
  }

  if (false !== strrpos($salt, '{') || false !== strrpos($salt, '}')) {
    throw new \InvalidArgumentException('Cannot use { or } in salt.');
  }

  return $password.'{'.$salt.'}';
}

It's seems straight forward but I stuck with it.
As I read this it does:

Merge salt and clear text password to: ""password{salt}""
Hash this string with SHA-512 and return a binary string into digest variable
iterate 5k times and use digest concatenated with merged cleartext password to rehash into digest
encode digest to base64

So here are my try in Java:
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.security.MessageDigest;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.util.Base64;

public void legacyEncryption(String salt, String clearPassword) throws UnsupportedEncodingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException {
  // Get digester instance for algorithm ""SHA-512"" using BounceCastle
  MessageDigest digester = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-512"", new BouncyCastleProvider());

  // Create salted password string
  String mergedPasswordAndSalt = clearPassword + ""{"" + salt + ""}"";

  // First time hash the input string by using UTF-8 encoded bytes.
  byte[] hash = digester.digest(mergedPasswordAndSalt.getBytes(""UTF-8""));

  // Loop 5k times
  for (int i = 0; i < 5000; i++) {
    // Concatenate the hash bytes with the clearPassword bytes and rehash
    hash = digester.digest(ArrayUtils.addAll(hash, mergedPasswordAndSalt.getBytes(""UTF-8"")));
  }

  // Log the resulting hash as base64 String
  logger.info(""Legace password digest: salt="" + salt + "" hash="" + Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(hash));
}

Does anybody see the problem? I think the difference is in the result of the:
PHP: binary.binary
and the
JAVA: addAll(byte[],byte[])
Thanks in advance
","The implementation on php side is correctly doing 5k iterations by doing first round of hashing and then looping 4999 times.
$digest = hash($this->algorithm, $salted, true);

for ($i = 1; $i < $this->iterations; ++$i) {
  $digest = hash($this->algorithm, $digest.$salted, true);
}

In the the java implementation the for loop starts at 0 which results in 5k + 1 iteration.
By starting the for loop at 1 in java too, the resulting password hashes are then equals.
byte[] hash = digester.digest(mergedPasswordAndSalt.getBytes(""UTF-8""));

for (int i = 0; i < 5000; i++) {

"51559181","SHA512 pure Lua 5.1 adaptation","I was searching for a pure Lua 5.1 adaptation for SHA512 and yielded no results anywhere I went. I found a similar question where someone tried to convert the SHA256 adaptation into SHA512 (except he was using Lua 5.3):

Instead of the actual hash (which is this):
1F40FC92DA241694750979EE6CF582F2D5D7D28E18335DE05ABC54D0560E0F5302860C652BF08D560252AA5E74210546F369FBBBCE8C12CFC7957B2652FE9A75

So my question is, why is it wielding such different results. Is it a problem with the bitwise operator functions? I am stumped.
","Here is a working implementation of SHA512 for Lua 5.1
File sha2for51.lua
-- This module contains functions to calculate SHA2 digest.
--    Supported hashes: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256
--    This is a pure-Lua module, compatible with Lua 5.1
--    It works on Lua 5.1/5.2/5.3/5.4/LuaJIT, but it doesn't use benefits of Lua versions 5.2+

--    Input data may must be provided either as a whole string or as a sequence of substrings (chunk-by-chunk).
--    Result (SHA2 digest) is a string of lowercase hex digits.
--
--    Simplest usage example:
--       local your_hash = require(""sha2for51"").sha512(""your string"")

--    See file ""sha2for51_test.lua"" for more examples.

 $this->_user = User::find()->where(""username = :username AND (password = 'SHA1(CONCAT(salt, SHA1(CONCAT(salt, SHA1(':password')))))' OR password = '"" . md5("":password"") . ""') AND status = :status"")

","Don't use findBySql if you don't have specific reason. You loose abstractions. 
'"" . md5("":password"") . ""' is also bad and wrong: you hashed not sql request, but string :password.
Look this code:
$query = User::find()->where('password_hash = SHA1(:password)', [
    ':password' => 'password'
]);

$sql = $query->createCommand()->getRawSql();
$user = $query->one();

Use getRawSql for debug your request. You always can see what sended to sql server.

","This is the wrong way to check a password. It is not possible to verify a password inside an SQL statement, because of the salt which is hopefully applied. Also it is unsecure to use SHA-1 to store passwords, because this algorithm is ways too fast and can be brute-forced easily.
Instead you can do a query with only the username. If a row could be found, you can read and verify the password hash:
$sql = ""SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = :username AND status = :status"";

The Yii framework offers helper functions to generate and verify password hashes. This documentation may get you started. An alternative is to call the PHP functions password_hash() and password_verify() directly.

It is a git hash-object input, with the header along with the commit message. The results I am getting are very different from one method to the other.

Is it possible for a sha1 hash to be all numbers or letters,
And second is there any need for the start and end delimiters when using a regex to check for a sha 1 hash, ie,
/^[0-9a-f]{40}$/i

inplace of
/[0-9a-f]{40}/i

Is there any need to use the delimeters?
I ask as should I check if the pattern has at least one number and at least one letter, or does this not matter?
","A sha1 hash is a 160 bit value that can be between all 0s and all 1s.  This means that yes, in theory it can be all numbers or all letters (more specifically, the hex representation of it can be).
As for the beginning and ending markers, they are required unless you check the string in other ways.  The two patterns you posted are not equivalent:
/^[0-9a-f]{40}$/i

A string that consists of and only of 40 character in 0-9 or a-f.
/[0-9a-f]{40}/i

A string that contains 40 character in 0-9 or a-f in a row.
In other words, the first pattern would consider this invalid whereas the second would not:
|0000000000000000000000000000000000000000|
The second pattern would match the 40 valid characters in the middle and not care about the rest of it.
You could effectively turn the second pattern into the first if you also used strlen to verify that the string is exactly 40 characters.  This would be a bit redundant though, as you'd essentially then have a pattern of:
A string that: (contains 40 characters in 0-9 or a-f in a row) and (is exactly 40 characters).
The first version expresses it more compactly, though the second is a bit more obvious.

","This code is simply distributing file names “randomly” (but reproducibly) over a number of bins and then grouping the bins into just the three categories.  The number of bits in the hash is irrelevant (so long as it’s “enough”, which is probably about 35 for this sort of work).
Reducing modulo n+1 produces a value on [0,n], and multiplying that by 100/n obviously produces a value on [0,100], which is being interpreted as a percentage.  n being MAX_NUM_IMAGES_PER_CLASS is meant to control the rounding error in the interpretation to be no more than “one image”.
This strategy is reasonable, but looks a bit more sophisticated than it is (since there is still rounding going on, and the remainder introduces a bias—although with numbers this large it is utterly unobservable).  You could make it simpler and more accurate by simply precalculating ranges over the whole space of 2^160 hashes for each class and just checking the hash against the two boundaries.  That still notionally involves rounding, but with 160 bits it’s only that intrinsic to representing decimals like 31% in floating point.

","First, you are not talking about a collision. A collision is when someone finds two distinct messages which hash to the same value. Here you are not fearing someone finding another input which hash to the value you publish; indeed, you fear someone finding your input. The correct term is preimage attack. Sometimes, we say that the attacker is trying to ""invert"" the hash function (find an input matching a given output).
There are two ways to try to find a preimage for a given hash value: exploit a weakness of the hash function, or guess the input by trying out candidates.
There is no known weakness of SHA-2 with regards to preimage resistance. Come to that, there is no such known weakness for MD5 or even MD4, although those two functions are considered to be, cryptographically speaking, thoroughly broken. Therefore, barring stupendous advances in scientific research on hash function, chances are that your hash value will not be found through a hash function cryptographic weakness.
Trying candidates may be possible, or not, depending on what the attacker knows of the input. This is quite hard to accurately model. Suppose, for instance, that the input is a single word containing seven letters. There are 267 = 8031810176 such words. Trying out all of them with SHA-256, comparing each time with your hash value, takes a few minutes on a recent PC, with a naive implementation.
On a more general basis, exploring the set of possible inputs is called a dictionary attack because it is often applied on the problem of recovering a user password: users are depressingly unimaginative and often choose passwords from a limited set of, well, ""words"", and it seems logical to call ""dictionary"" that set of words. We also call it ""brute force"" or ""exhaustive search"".
Assuming that the dictionary is sufficiently small for an attacker to realistically try out all its words, then not only your hash value will be eventually inverted (if there is enough incentive for the attacker), but this also opens the way for cost sharing: the attacker may try to share his computing efforts across several similar attack situations (i.e. several hash values to invert, with the same hash function -- there again, a common password-related attack model). A basic cost sharing method is to make a precomputed table: the attacker computes all the hashes for his dictionary once; then, all subsequent hash values can be attacked by simply looking up the hash value in the table. A lookup is very fast (the attacker sorts his hashes in increasing order). Rainbow tables are a kind of precomputed table, in a smart way which allows for a compact representation: they make it possible for the attacker to ""keep"" a big precomputed table without needing a truckload of hard disks. Still, rainbow or not, all the values in the table (the one before compression in the case of a rainbow table) must be computed at least once by an attacker somewhere, i.e. that someone is able to do a full dictionary attack. This has two costs: the CPU cost (for computing all the hashes) and the storage cost (for storing the hash values). A rainbow table makes the storage cheaper, but does not improve things with regards to CPU.
Salting defeats precomputed tables (including rainbow tables). It makes small dictionaries more tolerable. That is, if we assume that inverting one hash value is doable, then the salt makes sure that, at least, the attacker will have to pay the full CPU cost of a dictionary attack each time, and he won't be able to share his cost across several attacks or with other attackers. Salting is needed for passwords, because it turned out to be impossible, in all generality, to make generic users choose and remember passwords from a large enough set of possible passwords.
It still is much better if your input is from a dictionary large enough to defeat a single brute forcing effort. The important thing is the size of the set of values which your input string may take; that set must be estimated with regards to what the attacker knows of the attacked data. For instance, if the attacker is trying to find a user password, then he knows that the input string is short (users have little patience) and consists only in characters that can be input (blindly !) on a keyboard; and he also knows that the sequence can be memorized, which makes things like "".%f*(.ds/~\d09j@"" quite improbable. There is no limit per se on the input size; we say that rainbow tables are limited to ""15 characters or so"" because users who accept to type more than 15 characters will also choose passwords from too large a set to allow the single brute force effort needed for table construction. Note that trying all sequences of 15 characters is already way too much (even all sequences of 15 lowercase letters imply more than 270 hash computations, and that's not really feasible with today's technology).

","Thomas's answer is already very detailed, but I would add this  criteria: 

What is the benefit of breaking the hash?

Drop a penny on the street. How long does it take until someone picks it up?
Now drop a $20 bill and do the same experiment.
If the value of what you are trying to secure is low, it is possible that nobody will try to break the hash at all.
If the value and benefit of breaking the hash is high, it will only survive as long as it takes to buy the necessary computing power from the Amazon cloud. They now even sell GPUs.

It is not uncommon for CA to have the same public key in a certificate for different certificates signed with different signature algorithms. But since it is unknown about which specific certificates you are talking you have to check yourself if these have the same public key.

After updating an enterprise application, I got an error because the root certificate using md5.

That's strange or an error in the application. A root certificate is trusted because it is in the trust store and not because of its signature. Thus the signature algorithm should not matter at all since the signature of a root certificate does not need to be verified.

Also I dont know if it matters but can passwords support multi-language with this current plan or will I run into any issues? (I am talking about funky characters like Arabic, Chinese, etc)
","On salts:
The salt is public data (if it was meant to be confidential then it would not be called a ""salt"" but a ""key""). The salt must be known to verify a password (since it enters the hash function along with the password) so it is stored as cleartext, as you intend to do.
The point of the salt is to prevent an attacker from sharing attack costs between attack instances. Guessing a user-chosen password is often possible (users only have human brains and are rarely good at memorizing complex passwords). The salt makes sure that, at least, an attacker will have to pay the full price of password guessing (i.e. ""trying"" a big dictionary of possible passwords) for each attacked password.
The salt works well as long as it is unique for each password. Note that unique for each user is not sufficient: sometimes, users change their passwords, and you do not want the same salt to be used for the next password (otherwise, some level of cost sharing becomes available to the attacker). So you want the select a new salt any time a password is stored, i.e. when the account is created and whenever the password is changed.
Uniqueness of salts is easily ensured by using big enough random salts. 32-byte salts are more than enough for that: the risk of selecting twice the same salt (out of bad luck) is negligible.
An additional level of security, beyond salting, is to make password hashing ""expensive"". For instance, when you hash the (salted) password, you actually hash the concatenation of 10000 times the salt+password sequence. This makes password verification 10000 times more expensive, both for you and for the attacker. It is often the case that legitimate password verification can be made computationally heavier with no noticeable effect (even if you check 100 user passwords per second, you can still devote 100µs to that, and it will use only 1% of your processing time), but making things 10000 times harder for the attacker is a good idea.
On languages:
The main problem with non-ASCII passwords is that some glyphs may use several encodings. For instance, an 'é' can be encoded, with Unicode, as a single code point (U+00E9 LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE) or as two code points (U+0065 LATIN SMALL LETTER E, followed by U+0301 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT). Note that this example is about a fairly common French letter, nothing as fancy (computer-wise) as Chinese or Korean. Encoding issues can be handled through Unicode Normalization Forms but this is not an easy programming tasks. Some programming environments can help (e.g., in Java, use java.text.Normalizer, which implements UNF).
Also, non-ASCII passwords can prove difficult to enter for users who switch keyboards, e.g. when the user wants to use a shared computer in an hotel or an airport (typing sensitive passwords on such systems is not a really good idea anyway).
I would recommend trying to enforce ASCII-only passwords if possible, or otherwise bite the bullet: perform UNF (with NFD form), then UTF-8 encoding. The resulting sequence of bytes is what goes to the hashing stage.

","To really guarantee the uniqueness, you must check every new item agaist the whole history.
For instance, you can organize a table in RDB with primary key valued as your generated one and keep on generating until your insert actually succeeds. Sounds like a huge overhead but for most practical purposes it is not.
Another approach could be, again if a RDB is available and have a facility similar to sequence in Oracle, is to use this facility in conjunction with your algorithm.

Performance is off by about 3 cycles per byte. On my 2.2 GHz Celeron J3455 test machine (Goldmont with SHA extensions), that's about 230 MiB/s. Its non-trivial.

","I created this answer based on the tag inline assembly with no specific language mentioned. Extended assembly templates already assume use of extensions to the languages.
If the Yz constraint isn't available you can attempt to create a temporary variable to tell CLANG what register to use rather than a constraint. You can do this through what is called an Explicit Register Variable:

You can define a local register variable and associate it with a specified register like this:
 register int *foo asm (""r12"");

Here r12 is the name of the register that should be used. Note that this is the same syntax used for defining global register variables, but for a local variable the declaration appears within a function. The register keyword is required, and cannot be combined with static. The register name must be a valid register name for the target platform.

In your case you wish to force usage of xmm0 register. You could assign the c parameter to a temporary variable using an explicit register and use that temporary as a parameter to the Extended Inline Assembly. This is the primary purpose of explicit registers in GCC/CLANG.
GCC_INLINE __m128i GCC_INLINE_ATTRIB
MM_SHA256RNDS2_EPU32(__m128i a, const __m128i b, const __m128i c)
{
   register const __m128i tmpc asm(""xmm0"") = c;
   __asm__(""sha256rnds2 %2, %1, %0"" : ""+x""(a) : ""x""(b), ""x"" (tmpc));
    return a;
}

The compiler should be able to provide some optimizations now since it has more knowledge as to how the xmm0 register is to be used.
When you placed mov %2, %%xmm0; into the template CLANG (and GCC) do not do any optimizations on the instructions. Basic Assembly and Extended Assembly templates are a black box that it only knows how to do basic substitution based on the constraints.

Here's a disassembly using the method above. It was compiled with clang++ and -std=c++03. The extra moves are no longer present:

","We'll, lets see... The english language has about 1,000,000 words. That's about 20 bits per word. SHA1 is 160 bits, so you'll need 8 words. Theoretically, All you'll have to do is to take the n'th word of the oxford english dictionary, where n is a group of 20 bits at a time.
Now, to make it more natural, you can try to add ""in/at/on/and/the..."" between words, according to their type (nouns,verbs...) using some simple algorithm. (You should remove all these words from your base dictionary, of course).
The algorithm is reversible: Just remove all the words you've added, and convert each word to it's 20-bit index.
Also, try google ""insult generator"". Some of those generators are pretty nice. I'm not sure about the number of combinations, though.
You can buy the Oxford English Dictionary on CD-ROM with more than 500,000 words (19-bit). I'm not sure if it would be easy to extract the words and their types, however. I'm not sure if it is legal, but I think you can't claim a patent on dictionary entries...

","A very simple approach would be:
 Take list of say 1024 nouns, 1024 verbs and 1024 adjectives each. Your phrase could then be  sentence of the form
noun[bits_01-10] verb[bits11-20] adjective[bits21-30] verb[bits31-40],
noun[bits_41-50] verb[bits51-60] adjective[bits61-70] verb[bits71-80],
noun[bits_81-90] verb[bits91-100] adjective[bits101-110] verb[bits111-120] and 
noun[bits_121-130] verb[bits131-140] adjective[bits141-150] verb[bits151-160].

With a bit more linguistic thought you can probably construct slightly more complicated ad thus not so repetitive looking sentences (say, a bit for singular / plural, a bit of two for different tenses,...). Longer word lists use up a few more bits but my guess is that you reach rather exotic words quite fast.

","This is an old question but entropoetry is a JavaScript (Node/frontend) library that also solves this problem. It combines Markov poetry with Huffman coding, so given the same dictionary (i.e., the same version of the library), converting poetry↔︎numbers will be bidirectional.
Example, from the Node command line:
> var Poet = require('entropoetry'); var p = new Poet();
> p.stringify(Buffer.from('deadbeef', 'hex'))
'old trick of loving you\nif you but'
> console.log(p.parse(`old trick of loving you

Here is the output as you see the output does not match, anyone know what I'm doing wrong?
Hash got 5ba93c9db0cff93f52b521d7420e43f6eda2784f, expected da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709

","Your Go code is computing the SHA of an input of length 1, with a value of [ 0 ].
The touch command actually creates an empty file (zero length), so the equivalent Go code would be:
hash := sha1.New()
// hash.Write([]byte{}) 
data := hash.Sum(nil)
fmt.Printf(""hash: %x"", data)

The (commented) Write call above is a no-op.  Playground
Your test code does not actually seem to read from a file.  Anyway, per your request, here is what a full sha utility would look like in Go:
package main

import (
        ""crypto/sha1""
        ""fmt""
        ""io""
        ""log""
        ""os""
)

func main() {
        if len(os.Args) < 2 {
                fmt.Printf(""usage: %s <file>\n"", os.Args[0])
                os.Exit(1)
        }

        file := os.Args[1]

        f, err := os.Open(file)

        if err != nil {
                log.Fatal(err)
        }

        defer f.Close()

        hash := sha1.New()

        _, err = io.Copy(hash, f)

        if err != nil {
                log.Fatal(err)

I want to upload image to the server. But before uploading the file I have to send the SHA1 checksum of that file so the server could check if the file is already uploaded so I don't upload it again.
The problem is that for the same file I don't get the same SHA1 checksum in my app and on the server side.
Here is the code in my Android app:
public static String getSHA1FromFileContent(String filename)
        throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, IOException {

    final MessageDigest messageDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-1"");

    InputStream is = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(filename));
    final byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];

    for (int read = 0; (read = is.read(buffer)) != -1;) {
        messageDigest.update(buffer, 0, read);
    }

    is.close();

    // Convert the byte to hex format
    Formatter formatter = new Formatter();

    for (final byte b : messageDigest.digest()) {
        formatter.format(""%02x"", b);
    }

    String res = formatter.toString();

    formatter.close();

    return res;
}

And here is the code on the server side:
def hashFile(f):

sha1 = hashlib.sha1()

if hasattr(f, 'multiple_chunks') and f.multiple_chunks():
    for c in f.chunks():
    sha1.update(c)
else:
    try:
    sha1.update(f.read())
    finally:
    f.close()

return sha1.hexdigest()

What is the problem and why do I get different SHA1 checksums?
","Turned out there was some server side image editing before generating the sha1 sum that wasn't meant to be done in this scenario. They made changes on the server side and now this is working perfectly.

","Mike Howard's answer on the question Mark linked to is the correct best practice.
Simply using a good hash is insufficient because:

it does not protect you from rainbow table attacks.  The same password will hash to the same result, every time.  An attacker can compromise on the time vs. space tradeoff, pre-compute the most popular passwords and simply look up the answer.  To defeat, you need to add a salt.  (Mike suggests user id)  
as you suggest, hashing algorithms are designed to be fast.  This is sometimes desired, (such as getting the hash of a 50MB file) but in the case of passwords it not.  Use a password-based key derivation function instead.  It will significantly slow down an attacker, but not impact your own speed.

","On the Python piece you are using PKCS#1 v1.5 padding for signing. On the Java piece you are using PSS. As you are using different schemes it's only natural that these two won't produce the same output. Generally it is more recommended to use PSS scheme over v1.5.
I'm no Python expert, but after quick look in internet, maybe Hazmat crypto library could help you with that on Python (https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/rsa/):
>>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
>>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding
>>> message = b""A message I want to sign""
>>> signature = private_key.sign(
...     message,

...         salt_length=padding.PSS.MAX_LENGTH
...     ),
...     hashes.SHA256()

","In general, you should store the hashed passwords and random salt values in the database. 
When a user authenticates, his or her username and password are sent to the server (preferably, over an SSL secured connection). Form there, you use the username to retrieve the salt value and hashed password from the database to do your comparison with.
Bottom line, you should never store plain-text passwords or send them over an unsecured connection.

","It's pretty much impossible. Like Derek said, the right thing is get an SSL cert and send plain text passwords over that.
Salting is to protect a stolen password database from revealing everyones password. But if the hash step is done on the client, the value in the database is the exact string that is sent over the network.
If you really cannot use SSL, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge-response_authentication#Cryptographic_techniques describes a way to avoid sending the password (or the hash, which is almost the same).

Store username/password in a variable/array inside the PHP file. Only people with access to your server can see the username then.
Storing the information in a file with a strange filename together with a hash algorithm + salt is also a possibility.

","Hard-coding the password in the PHP file is not per se a huge security issue, as someone would need to access the PHP file anyway to read it: if someone gained access to your PHP files you would have a much bigger problem than your lost password.
However, avoid:

storing the password in clear text, save an hash instead.
storing the password in JS files, as the source of JS files is accessible by the client

There are different types of hashes, I would suggest not to use MD5, especially if your password is not very complex. Sites like this hold databases of MD5 hashes, so your hash could easily be cracked.
Use something a bit more secure, like SHA256.
NOTE: obviously whoever owns the server has the physical access to your files and DB, but if you stored the hash you should be fine. If you are really concerned about the possibility that whoever owns the server has a look through your ""secure"" stuff, you shouldn't be using a shared server as a start.

"19759645","How to reliably re-calculate blob sha1 hash (or another identity) from (user) text content and escape line-end/whitespace hell?","I have some code for Node.js that pull text files from Git (local Git or via the Github API) and uses the commit/tree/blob data in various scenarios. But I have problems with the line endings and recalculating sha hashes after I (or the user) uses the files. 
The data consist of source-code. It gets downloaded/used/linked/imported to a users project directory and used in development. I was hoping to use the git blob hashes to check for changes relative to the source blob.
My setup:
I'm on Windows but use Travis-CI and a VM to run builds.
I use this function to calculate the sha1-hash as hex-string:
var crypto = require('crypto');
function blobShaHex(data:NodeBuffer, encoding?:string):string {
    return crypto.createHash('sha1').update('blob ' + data.length + '\0').update(data, encoding).digest('hex');
}

So far this seems to work very well: data read as raw Buffers straight from the repos match their hashe, same with utf8 content.
Problem:
In practical user-use of the blob content the line endings break the blob sha1:
The file might get checked-in into a VCS and then get mangled by line-end conversions. Also the user's IDE may normalise line-breaks to user preference, even if the user never saves the file. Many other things may happen.
Note: my code is not pulling the blob from the Git repo where the files end up. Instead it is a separate thing (like dependency manager) that just moves blob-originating files around, which may-or-may not get checked in somewhere.
To make things extra messy I have no full control over the source-repo's line-endings so there is no guarantee about which style then come down with. Might even be mixed conventions (if that technically possible?).
Questions:
Is there some way to revert to the original linebreaks or otherwise verify a match? I could pull the original file again and do stuff with it.
Any advice on handling this would be welcome.
--
Now I typed this all up I'm starting to think it might be a really non-practical idea to attempt this. Maybe it'd be better to force normalise and create&track my own checksums or use some clever white-space ignoring diff thing? 
","I'll go with a custom hasher that normalises linebreaks and such instead of using Git's blobs sha hashes.

","You don't have to care that much because usage of the SHA-224 is quite limited.
In this question CBroe has pointed out an important remark:

That blog post is about SSL connections when your app is making API
  requests. This is not about anything you do with data within your app,
  it is about the transport layer.

According to the https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/15151/sha-224-purpose 
Answer by Ilmari Karonen:

Honestly, in practice, there are very few if any reasons to use
  SHA-224.
As fgrieu notes, SHA-224 is simply SHA-256 with a different IV and
  with 32 of the output bits thrown away. For most purposes, if you want
  a hash with more than 128 but less than 256 bits, simply using SHA-256
  and truncating the output yourself to the desired bit length is
  simpler and just as efficient as using SHA-224. As you observe,
  SHA-256 is also more likely to be available on different platforms
  than SHA-224, making it the better choice for portability.
Why would you ever want to use SHA-224, then?
The obvious use case is if you need to implement an existing protocol
  that specifies the use of SHA-224 hashes. While, for the reasons
  described above, it's not a very common choice, I'm sure such
  protocols do exist.
Also, a minor advantage of SHA-224 over truncated SHA-256 is that, due
  to the different IV, knowing the SHA-224 hash of a given message does
  not reveal anything useful about its SHA-256 hash, or vice versa. This
  is really more of an ""idiot-proofing"" feature; since the two hashes
  have different names, careless users might assume that their outputs
  have nothing in common, so NIST changed the IV to ensure that this is
  indeed the case.
However, this isn't really something you should generally rely on. If
  you really need to compute multiple unrelated hashes of the same input
  string, what you probably want instead is a keyed PRF like HMAC, which
  can be instantiated using any common hash function (such as SHA-256).

As you've mentioned, Windows XP with SP3 doesn't support SHA-224 but it supports SHA-256:

Part of the Thomas Pornin's answer:

ECDSA over a 256-bit curve already achieves an ""unbreakable"" level of
  security (i.e. roughly the same level than AES with a 128-bit key, or
  SHA-256 against collisions). Note that there are elliptic curves on
  prime fields, and curves on binary fields; which kind is most
  efficient depends on the involved hardware (for curves of similar
  size, a PC will prefer the curves on a prime field, but dedicated
  hardware will be easier to build with binary fields; the CLMUL
  instructions on the newer Intel and AMD processors may change that).
SHA-512 uses 64-bit operations. This is fast on a PC, not so fast on a
  smartcard. SHA-256 is often a better deal on small hardware (including
  32-bit architectures such as home routers or smartphones)

","There's no known easy or even moderately difficult way to do this in general.
The entire point of hashes (or so-called one-way functions), is that it's easy to compute them, but next to impossible to reverse their computation (find input values based on output). That said, for some hash functions, there are known methods that may allow computing inputs for a given hash value in reasonable time.
For example, this MD5 sum technique will find collisions (but not input for a given output) in about 8 hours on a 1.6GHz computer.

","This would be a ""preimage attack"". No such thing is publicly known against SHA-1.
The only attack known against SHA-1 is a collision attack. That means I find two inputs that produce the same result, but neither of them is pre-ordained, so to speak. Even so, this attack isn't really feasible for most people -- based on the amount of computation involved, the closest I can figure is that you'd have to spend somewhere in the range of a few million dollars to build a machine that would give you about one colliding pair of keys per week (assuming it ran, doing nothing else 24/7).

","Your sample values are in hex, whereas the XML contains base64.
For example, your SHA-256 value is 64 hex digits, so 32 bytes - which makes sense for SHA-256, which is 256 bits.
The DigestValue in the XML is 44 characters including one padding character - which is what I'd expect for 32 bytes, where every 3 bytes require 4 characters.
For example, here's some C# code to take the base64 hash and convert it to (dash-separated) hex:
using System;
using System.Text;

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        byte[] hash = Convert.FromBase64String(""wgvWtVSJns8mCgUPfBZ/2ZTBfKqR02zW0MD4tA3cIBE="");

... which matches the hash you computed for the original file, so at least you know you're computing it the right way.
I don't know anything about Tizen itself, but it sounds like you may need to update that XML file to include the base64 of the SHA-256 hash... or if you delete it, does the tooling replace it for you?

"37354199","Verification of Hashing password is not working","I have asked a question of which I did get a lot of great feedback, along with a good answer.  I assume that I am doing something wrong with my verification check of the 2 hashes.  Perhaps the code in the loop is fine, but my code with understanding of bytes and base64 etc. is the problem? 
Here is the original question.
Password Hashing - Why salt 60,000 times
Problem is these hashes do not match  if (resultHash.Equals(hashPassword))
Code 
public string BuildVerify()
{

    string password = """";
    string salt = """";
    byte[] result;


    using (var sha256 = SHA256.Create())
    {
        password = ""hovercraft"";

        // step 1: you can use RNGCryptoServiceProvider for something worth using
        var passwordHashing = new PasswordHashing();
        salt = passwordHashing.CreateRandomSalt();

        // step 2
        string hash =
           Convert.ToBase64String(sha256.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(salt + password)));

        // step 3
        result = sha256.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(salt + hash));

        // step 4
        for (int i = 0; i < 60000; i++)
        {
            result =
             sha256.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(salt + Convert.ToBase64String(result)));
        }
    }


    // TESTING  VERIFY this works ..

    string SaltAndPwd = string.Concat(password, salt);
    SHA256 sha2 = SHA256Managed.Create();
    byte[] buff = sha2.ComputeHash(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(SaltAndPwd));
    string resultHash = Convert.ToBase64String(buff);
    string hashPassword = Convert.ToBase64String(result);

    if (resultHash.Equals(hashPassword))
    {
        // perfect 
    }





    return """";

}


public class PasswordHashing
{

     public string CreateRandomSalt()
     {
        string password = """";
        password = HashPassword.CreateSalt(8) + ""="";
        password = password.Replace(""/"", ""c"");
        return password;
     }

  }

public static string CreateSalt(int size)
{
    RNGCryptoServiceProvider rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();

    byte[] buff = new byte[size];
    rng.GetBytes(buff);
    return Convert.ToBase64String(buff);
}

Update - issue 
Ok, I'm using the code from the answer, but obviously my assumptions are not correct as I cannot use my code to verify 
            // This should be stored in your DB for example along with the hash result
            var newsalt = SOPasswordHasher.GetSalt();

            // We calculate the hash then store the result. Next time you want to authenticate someone
            // You'll have to reuse the same salt and recalculate the hash then compare 
            // the stored hash with the new one
            var result = Convert.ToBase64String(SOPasswordHasher.Hash(""hovercraft"", newsalt));

            string SaltAndPwd = string.Concat(""hovercraft"", newsalt);
            SHA256 sha2 = SHA256Managed.Create();
            byte[] buff = sha2.ComputeHash(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(SaltAndPwd));
            string resultHash = Convert.ToBase64String(buff);

            if (result.Equals(resultHash))
            {
                // perfect 
            }

","Here's a reusable class that you can use (relying less on converting to base64):
class SOPasswordHasher
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Password Hasher
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name=""password"">The password you want to hash</param>
    /// <param name=""salt"">byte array of (crypto-secure) random values</param>
    /// <param name=""iterations"">Number of iterations. default is 60,000</param>
    /// <returns>Byte array containing the hashed password</returns>

    public static byte[] Hash(string password, byte[] salt, int iterations = 60000)
    {
        using (var sha256 = SHA256.Create())
        {
            byte[] passwordBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(password);

            // step 2
            byte[] hash = sha256.ComputeHash(passwordBytes.Concat(salt).ToArray());

            // step 3
            byte[] result = sha256.ComputeHash(salt.Concat(hash).ToArray());

            // step 4
            for (int i = 0; i < iterations; i++)
            {
                result =
                    sha256.ComputeHash(salt.Concat(result).ToArray());
            }

            return result;
        }
    }

    public static byte[] GetSalt(int size = 32)
    {
        byte[] salt = new byte[size];
        using (var cryptoServiceProvider = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider())
        {
            cryptoServiceProvider.GetBytes(salt);
        }
        return salt;
    }
}

and here's a usage example:
// This should be stored in your DB for example along with the hash result
var salt = SOPasswordHasher.GetSalt();

// We calculate the hash then store the result. Next time you want to authenticate someone
// You'll have to reuse the same salt and recalculate the hash then compare 
// the stored hash with the new one
var result = Convert.ToBase64String(SOPasswordHasher.Hash(""hovercraft"", salt));

Fatal Error: hash_init: 'HmacSHA-256' is an unknown algorithm [hash_hmac]

http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.hash-hmac.php#93440
Are you aware of any other custom implementation?
2) let java decode the string and pass it to php. It's doable:
http://php-apps.appspot.com/hmac-sha-256-signature-for-amazon-product-api-requests.html

","There are two bugs in this implementation:

In rotr, you should have 64 - n instead of 32 - n
You should remove all % (long long)(pow(2, 64));. If you used uint64_t instead of unsigned long long, these weren't needed. And they cause bug here, because long long is usually 64-bit, and it cannot store the number 2^64. Using uint64_t ""automatically"" uses modulo 2^64.

And it is questionable to put all these function definitions and data into the header file. You should use inline for function definitions, at least. But you'd better move them into the .cpp.

as well as CryptoJS, but all of them give me different results, which none of them work. I was wondering if someone got this to work. I am aware of the python example posted here https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/business/webservices/auth, which does work but unfortunately I need to achieve the same functionality in JavaScript to upload it to Cloud Code in Parse. 
I would greatly appreciate any advice regarding this matter.
Thank you for your help in advance!
Cheers!

"31488803","libgit2sharp what is correct sha to supply to GitHub API merge pull-request?","GitHub API requires merge pull-request to be submitted as 
PUT /repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:number/merge

with request body json
{
  ""commit_message"": ""blah"",
  ""sha"": ""{SHA that pull request head must match to allow merge}"",
}

Following a commit, push, create PR, what libgit2sharp property supplies the correct sha ?
For the current branch, it appears Branch.Tip.Sha is the correct value, but I'm receiving response error : 

{   ""message"": ""Head branch was modified. Review and try the merge
  again."",   ""documentation_url"":
  ""https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#merge-a-pull-request-merge-button""
  }

","Two different commits and shas come into play when it comes to Pull Request.

The tip of your branch (the very last commit you've pushed on your branch)

Syntax: GET /repos/:owner/:repo/git/refs/:ref (where :ref should be of the pull/{number}/head format)
Example: https://api.github.com/repos/libgit2/libgit2sharp/git/refs/pull/1123/head

The virtual merge commit that GitHub dynamically creates behind the scene to determine mergeability and allow CI servers to run your build/tests as if your branch was already merged (and thus, detect in advance any potential issue)

Syntax: GET /repos/:owner/:repo/git/refs/:ref (where :ref should be of the pull/{number}/merge format)
Example: https://api.github.com/repos/libgit2/libgit2sharp/git/refs/pull/1123/merge


When leveraging the GitHub API to merge an opened Pull Request, the optional sha property from the json payload is expected to match the sha of the branch tip as currently known by GitHub.
Provided your local repository is in sync with what GitHub knows about your repository, this should definitely be matching what repo.Branches[""your_topic_branch""].Tip.Sha returns.
Note: In order to ensure that the GitHub known head of the PR matches your local branch tip, using LibGit2Sharp, you can retrieve GitHub PR merge/head pointed at commits, by directly fetching a special reference namespace. The following code demonstrates this
var remoteName = ""origin""; // or whatever your remote is named
var remote = repo.Network.Remotes[remoteName];
var prNumber = ""1123""; // or whatever your pr number is

// Build the refspec
string refSpec = string.Format(""+refs/pull/{1}/*:refs/remotes/{0}/pull/{1}/*"", 
                        remoteName, prNumber);

// Perform the actual fetch
repo.Network.Fetch(remote, new[] { refSpec });

Console.WriteLine(repo.Branches[string.Format(""pull/{0}/merge"", prNumber)].Tip.Sha);

"50273289","PKCS11Interop Hash with SHA256 and Sign with RSA in two steps","I have two applications, one that calculates the SHA-256 hash of a document and the other which makes the RSA signing.
Trying different things i came to the conclusion that making CKM_SHA256 and then making CKM_RSA_PKCS give a different result than just making the CKM_SHA256_RSA_PKCS of the document itself.
So my question is, what is the difference between this two implementations? 
What information is added to the hash in CKM_SHA256_RSA_PKCS mechanism that turns in a complete different signature?
","Mechanims CKM_SHA256_RSA_PKCS does following things:

Computes SHA256 hash of the data just like CKM_SHA256 does
Constructs DER encoded DigestInfo structure defined in RFC 8017
Signs DigestInfo structure with private key just like CKM_RSA_PKCS does

Several approaches are possible when it comes to construction of DER encoded DigestInfo structure:

In Pkcs11Admin application I did use BouncyCastle library:

public static byte[] CreateDigestInfo(byte[] hash, string hashOid)
{
    DerObjectIdentifier derObjectIdentifier = new DerObjectIdentifier(hashOid);
    AlgorithmIdentifier algorithmIdentifier = new AlgorithmIdentifier(derObjectIdentifier, null);
    DigestInfo digestInfo = new DigestInfo(algorithmIdentifier, hash);
    return digestInfo.GetDerEncoded();
}


In Pkcs11Interop.X509Store library I did use precomputed arrays:

/// <summary>
/// Creates DER encoded PKCS#1 DigestInfo structure defined in RFC 8017
/// </summary>
/// <param name=""hash"">Hash value</param>
/// <param name=""hashAlgorithm"">Hash algorithm</param>

","My understanding is, that repeated hashing (for computational cost) & a good random salt, should defeat all but seriously determined cryptographic attackers.
Hashing passwords in the database, and over the network, avoids plaintext being recoverable (and usable elsewhere) by a snooper or attacker who does get in.
Basically this is more or less the scheme, used by the Wordpress authentication:
var SALT = 64 random characters;
var NUM_HASHES = about 1000;    // can be randomized
var hashedResult = inputPassword;
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_HASHES; i++) {
  var dataToHash = SALT + hashedResult;
  hashedResult = secureHash( dataToHash);
}
//... can now store or send.

This use of a random salt, and looping hash, defeats any rainbow tables or single-level 'hash collision', 'hash weakness' attack. Only brute-forcing the complete keyspace, each key through 1000 iterations of the hash function, is believed to defeat it :)

Generate random salt for each password.
Avoid MD5, and even SHA-1.
Use a slow hashing algorithm; SHA-256 seems to be a good choice for now.
Password storage is one of those rare occasions where there is some benefit to having your own (overall) algorithm.  Consider an attacker with a rainbow table; if your password storage algorithm varies from the one used to generate their rainbow table enough to change the generated values, that rainbow table is of no use.  The attacker would need to know your algorithm, then generate a new table.  If you choose a slow hashing algorithm, generating a new table is very expensive.

By ""overall"" algorithm, I mean the complete definition of how you transform the plaintext password into the stored value.  E.g. SHA-256(""mypassword"" + ""[["" + 40-char-random-alphanum-salt + ""]]"").  If you change that to use angle brackets instead of square brackets, you've changed the rainbow table necessary to exploit your stored passwords.  Note that I'm not advocating writing your own hash algorithm; you should still choose a cryptographically secure hash algorithm.
See this article by the author of MD5.  He makes the two main points I repeated above: 1) if you use a fast hashing algorithm, you're missing the point, and 2) reuse of overall algorithms allows re-use of rainbow tables.

","You've pretty much nailed it.  just took the hard/wrong way converting from char[] to String -> new String(password) is all you need.  (hint, if you find yourself manually converting between bytes and chars, you're probably doing it wrong).
as a side note, exceptions are ""thrown"" for a reason.  that makes it easy to skip the following code which shouldn't be executed when the exception is thrown.  by catching and turning the exceptions into ""if"" blocks, you make the code more complex than it needs to be.

Recently PayPal is requiring servers to support SHA-256. Here's an article referring to this issue:
https://www.paypal-knowledge.com/infocenter/index?page=content&id=FAQ1766&expand=true&locale=en_US
At the top of the article, it states,

Update your integration to support certificates using the SHA-256 algorithm. PayPal is upgrading SSL certificates on all Live and Sandbox endpoints from SHA-1 to the stronger and more robust SHA-256 algorithm.

We have a dedicated CentOS server with numerous sites, mostly WordPress. Quite a few use PayPal IPN but do not have dedicated IPs or SSL Certificates. What needs to be changed to the server so these sites will support SHA-256? Our server is situated with Limestone Networks so I've created a ticket and asked repeatedly for assistance to no avail. They keep repeating SSL's need to be updated on the server. Would that be a wildcase SSL certificate in the usage case I described? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
","Based on your comments, it sounds like this is nothing to do with SHA256, but a simple CN mismatch. A certificate is only good for the names listed in it. You could try adding a subjectAltName for each of the required hosts, or a wildcard certificate for *.example.com (though I wouldn't trust one of those for my server.)

I've tested my api credentials in the console by running the following bash script (which gives me the correct response)
$ challenge=$(curl -s ""http://www.company.com/api/hello.json?app_id=$name"" | head -1 | sed 's/.*""challenge"": *""\([0-9]*\)"".*/\1/')

","This answer is not so much for the OP (who is hopefully sorted now) but any passers by who encounter the error in the question.
The error 
shasum: [CHECKSUM_FILENAME] : no properly formatted SHA[TYPE] checksum lines found

indicates that the checksum file passed to the -c flag is not formatted as 
follows
a67eb6eeeff63ac77d34c2c86b0a3fa97f69a9d3f8c9d34c20036fa79cb4214d  ./kbld-linux-amd64

Where 

the first field is the expected checksum,
the second field is a ' ' character indicating that the file is to be checked as a text file (as opposed to being checked as a binary file or being checking in Universal mode which  ignores newlines) 
and the third field is the name of the file you likely just downloaded and whose integrity you want to verify

So in the example above the developers who created kbld supplied the above text on their release page to show the checksums that they calculated after they built the kbld binaries for various platforms.
I added the line for the linux build to a file called kbld_v0_7_0.checksum and then I ran the following in the directory where I downloaded the kbld-linux-amd64 binary 
$ shasum -c kbld_v0_7_0.checksum -a 256
./kbld-linux-amd64: OK

The OK from shasum shows that the binary that I downloaded, ./kbld-linux-amd64 , generates the same sha256 checksum that was produced when the developers did their build which indicates that the files are, in all likelihood, identical

Remember hashing and encryption are two different things -> http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function & http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_hash.
Hashing is a one-way function so typically what attackers do is run through a bunch of passwords in a wordlist, hash them and search for a match against the hashed password that they've stolen. The longer and more complex your password along with hashing the password with a random salt, then the harder it is to, as you say, hack the password.

","The SHA1 has not yet been generated (the commit has not yet happened, because the hook can prevent it) and depends on the contents of the message.  So if your hook were to compute ""what it would be"" and then modify the message, the result would be different from the computed SHA1.
Thus, while it would be possible to compute ""what the SHA1 will be"", you can't then dump it into the commit message.

Are there any rules to what a SHA1 sum should adhere? I cannot find any, but from quick tests, all seem to be hexadecimal and around 40 characters long[1].
I am not interested in tests that prove whether or not the SHA-1 sum was made in a secure, properly random or other manner. Just that the format is correct.
I am also not interested in testing that the digest is an actual representation of some message; Just that it has the format of digest in the first place.

For the curious: this is for an application where I build avatars for users based on a.o. their uuid. I don't, however, want to place those uuids in the URL, but obfuscate them a little. So instead of avatars/baa4833d-b962-4ab1-87c5-283c9820eac4.png, we request avatars/5f2a13cb1d84a2e019842cdb8d0c8b03c9e1e414.png. Where 5f2a... is e.g. Digest::SHA1.hexdigest(uuid + ""secrect""). 
On the receiving side, I am adding some basic protection that sends back a 400 bad request whenever something is obviously false. Such as avatars/haxor.png or avatars/traversal../../../../attempt.png. Note that this is a very much simplified example.

[1] Two tests with different outcome:
Using sha1sum on Ubuntu Linux: 
$ echo ""hello"" | sha1sum | cut -d"" "" -f1 | wc -c
41

using Ruby's Digest:   
Digest::SHA1.hexdigest(""hello"").length
=> 40

Edit: turns out this is me, being stupid, wc-c includes the newline, as kennytm points out in the comments. Still: is it safe to assume it will be 40 characters, always?
","SHA-1 has a 160 bits digest
160 bits rendered is 160 / 8 = 20 bytes.
20 bytes rendered in hexadecimal format has a length of 40 chars (digits), two chars for each byte.
Digits can be [0-9a-f]
So the following regex should correctly validate the Sha1sum rendered as a string in hexadecimal format:

","The thing with bcrypt that makes it secure is that it's much slower to compute than any of the other algorithm.  
With what ever SHA version, you can just get better computers and you will be able to make a rainbow table in no time. With bcrypt it will still take ages, this algorithm is time expensive. Thus making it nearly impossible to retrieve the original passwords from the hash.
You can see this link for more information.
You can also see this thread from the Security StackExchange that covers it toroughly!

About the fact that the hash produce is smaller, well it doesn't really matters at all because as I said, if you want to find from which password does the hash comes from, it takes ages.
See this sandbox. Simply by putting the load factor over 15 will make it take more than 3 seconds to execute. Try playing around with it and you will understand why it's secure.
Code in the sandbox:
$time = microtime(true);
$pass =  crypt('myNewPassword', '$2y$15$usesomesillystringforsalt$');
$end_time = microtime(true);

$diff = $end_time - $time;
echo ""$pass\n$diff""

$2y$15$usesomesillystringforeTfp6/FuUgyb1HKFA36V9tf6Go5xlv/a

","SHA-256 is called a hash algorithm, and its purpose is simple: it takes any data and generates a unique series of bytes to represent it.  There is no way to reverse this process, and there are no known instances of a SHA-256 hash being not unique.
The purpose of the line of code in question is to generate one character of the final SHA-256 output.  Java gives you the has in raw data (a byte array) and we typically convert it to hexadecimal to represent it as a string.  That line of code is pretty complex, so I'll go over what each part of it does separately.
sb.append(); is taking the imput and adding it to the result stored in a StringBuilder.
Integer.toString(); Takes a number and represents it as a literal string
byteData[i] & 0xff Selects the current byte of hash data and uses the bitwise and operation using 0xff (so for each bit in the byte, if the corresponding bit in 0xff is the same, the output is a 1, if not the output is a 0.

The combination of 0x100 and substring(1) ensures that byte values < than 16 decimal (that is, 0 to F in hex) are also represented as two characters.
By the way:
String.format(""%02x"",byteData[i])

does exactly the same, and might be considered more readable, especially by people who are used to C printf style format strings.
Lastly, why (byteData[i] & 0xff) ? See here for a detailed explanation:

It works because Java will perform a widening conversion to int, using
  sign extension, so instead of a negative byte you will have a negative
  int. Masking with 0xff will leave only the lower 8 bits, thus making
  the number positive again (and what you initially intended).

","Since they have different number of rounds, different size of internal state and different block-size I'm pretty sure that the result of SHA-256 and SHA-512 are so different that you can't derive either of them from the other.
But if you are paranoid you could append/prepend different data for the different hash-functions. i.e. you calculate SHA-256(""A""+data+""B"") and SHA-512(""D""+data+""E"") (of course with longer strings instead of ABCD).
The only possibility I see is if the set of possible input values is small that you brute-force possible values until you hit the known hash and then calculate the other hash. Basically if the conditions are so that the attacker can reverse the known hash, he can also calculate the other hash.

"48016431","Google Script HMAC SHA512 output differs when adding '\n'","I'm trying to create a google script that generates a HMAC signature using SHA512 for authentication to an API. Here is the code I'm using:
     var SystemTimeMilli = Date.now()

     var InputString = ('Some Text' + '\n' + SystemTimeMilli);

     var PrivateKey = 'bEDtDJnW0y/Ll4YZitxb+D5sTNnEpQKH67EJRCmQCqN9cvGiB8+IHzB7HjsOs3mSlxLmu4aiPDRpe9anuWzylw=='  //sample private key

     var signature = Utilities.base64Encode(Utilities.computeHmacSignature(Utilities.MacAlgorithm.HMAC_SHA_512, InputString, PrivateKey, Utilities.Charset.UTF_8));

     Logger.log(signature);

This generates a string to the log but when compared to results using web based hash generators the results differ.
However if I use
var InputString = ('Some Text' + SystemTimeMilli);

without the \n the results generated in my Google Script and the web based hash generators match.
So I'm assuming the way Google Script is handling the new line is different to the web base generators but I can't figure out how to get them match or which one is the correct result.
EDIT
To add some further information:
Lets say SystemTimeMilli = 1234567890123 
When I enter ('Some Text' + SystemTimeMilli) into my script using
bEDtDJnW0y/Ll4YZitxb+D5sTNnEpQKH67EJRCmQCqN9cvGiB8+IHzB7HjsOs3mSlxLmu4aiPDRpe9anuWzylw== as the PrivateKey

Which is the same if I enter /account/balance1234567890123 into https://quickhash.com using SHA-512 (SHA2) as the Algorithm and Base64 Encoding as the Output Format.
However if I enter ('Some Text' + '\n' + SystemTimeMilli) in my script it returns 3sj1jbx1tQ4nc8XOkk3nW8TvG5zvCam2LN51fQWDXOKU5O/1KBAdzdp+YV+aAdYHWCY2x3jqCfbXKoOmfoD0KA==
But using 
/account/balance
1234567890123
in quickhash.com returns something different. I've tried a whole bunch of different combinations but I never get the same result as my script. 
I having trouble with getting my script to authenticate to the API so I really want to determine if I'm getting the correct HMAC to begin with.

The actual SHA that is used is just the SHA of the buffer described in that detailed version.
The key points to take home is that the SHA is dependent on the filenames of all contained objects or trees, their SHAs and their permissions. Change any of those and you change the SHA. If two trees have the same SHAs then all those components must match (excluding the possibility of collisions as they're nigh on impossible).

I know that I am creating a message of the correct bit size (1024 bits) and also working in 1024-bit chunks, or at least I believe I am.
I am not sure if it has to do with the handling of the integers (the standard requires unsigned integers) or whether I made a mistake in one of the utility functions, or both. If it is indeed an issue with the handling of the integers, how would I go about taking care of the problem. I was able to resolve this when working on the 256-bit version of the adaptation by using mod 2^32 when working with numbers in the digestblock method. I attempted to do mod 2^64 and 2^63 with the 512-bit version and it does not correct the problem. I am stumped.
I should mention that I cannot use one of the many library implementations as I am using a sandboxed Lua that does not provide this access, which is why I need a pure lua implementation. Thanks in advance.
","Unfortunately, after introducing integers in Lua 5.3 writing scripts for Lua becomes a more complicated task.
You must always think about transformations between integers and floating point numbers.
ALWAYS.  Yes, that's boring.  
One of your mistakes is an excellent example of this ""dark corner of Lua"".   
  local remainder = l % 256
  s = string.char(remainder) .. s
  --remove from l the bits we have already transformed
  l = (l-remainder) / 256

Your value l is initially a 64-bit integer.
After cutting off its first byte l contains (64-8) = 56 bits, but now it's a floating point-number (with 53-bit precision, of course).
Possible solution: use l = l >> 8 or l = l // 256 instead of l = (l-remainder) / 256

Another mistake is using s264num(msg, i + (j - 1) * 4) instead of s264num(msg, i + (j - 1) * 8)

One more mistake is in the following line:
local extra = 128 - (len + 9) % 128

The correct code is 
local extra = - (len + 17) % 128 + 8

(Please note that -a%m+b is not the same as b-a%m due to operator precedence)

After fixing these 3 mistakes your code works correctly.

","I downloaded the as3corelib.swc being used by that project, and ran the following code.

In addition to your output, which basically says Flash Player threw an error trying to construct a new Base64Encoder object, I got the following output.

It seems to be a known issue with as3corelib that was never resolved. 
However, this dependency is also open source, so I just downloaded Base64Encoder.as, and added it to my project. After this, the code compiled fine. This should work for your project, as well.

","First, it is mathematically impossible to recover an original message from a message digest. A message digest is a small amount of information that is intended to act as a sort of fingerprint for a large amount of information. For example, in one of the simplest forms, a message digest might be simply the sum of the numerical values of the characters in a message. You obviously cannot recover the original message just from the sum of its characters. (Two messages that are anagrams would have the same sum, so the sum would not tell you which of the two messages was the original. And a message changed by increasing one character and decreasing another would have the same sum as the original message, so, again, the sum would not distinguish them.) This is just an example—actual cryptographic hashes are more complicated than simple sums.
Second, cryptographic hashes and the message digests they produce are usually designed to be difficult to invert. It is intended to be difficult to find any message whose digest equals a given value.
If you want cryptographic functions that change a message to a cryptic form and then invert it, you are looking for encryption and decryption, not hashes or digests.

","If you know every possible messages beforehand, you have the list of every of them, you can produces the SHA-1 digests for each, hoping there's no collision (btw, if you found one, please share). Then, at receive time, you lookup which SHA-1 you received and match with the known possible messages.
It's not secure, as an observer could identify the behavior of your system in the response of every SHA-1, or it could have access to the database of known message.
So it's almost pointless.
You could assign each message a arbitrary number, it would work the same, and it would be faster and shorter.

"34522863","HMAC produces wrong results","All of this is new to me so please forgive my noobish question.
I'm trying to figure out HMAC step by step. 
Let's say I have a following SHA-1 method: 
public static string SHA_1(string input) 
{
    SHA1CryptoServiceProvider mySha = new SHA1CryptoServiceProvider();
    string temp = BitConverter.ToString(mySha.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(input)));
    temp = temp.Replace(""-"", """").ToUpper();
    return temp;
} 

It receives a plain text string;
Let's say my secret key is """" (empty string) and so is the message;
The HMAC is supposed to be: fbdb1d1b18aa6c08324b7d64b71fb76370690e1d
Now that's where I am a bit lost. I'll write down the steps as I understand them and please correct me if I am wrong (or where I am wrong rather). 

If the key is shorter than 64 bytes I need to pad it with 0's. 
So the padded key is 0x00 (x64 - because the key is empty, otherwise it's 64-key.Length);
Two constants each 64 bytes long are:

ipad = 0x36 (x64)
opad = 0x5c (x64)

because the key is empty string XOR results in the same opad and ipad, i.e.

ipad XOR key = ipad
opad XOR key = opad

At this point all left to do is to compute the HMAC itself. 

So: HMAC = Hash(opad || Hash(ipad || message)) and that should be it. 
But I am not sure how to execute this. 
The message is a text string. opad and ipad are uint/byte arrays. I can convert them to ASCII as well and receive respectively:
ipad_str = ""6666666666..."" x64
opad_str = ""\\\\\\\...."" x64
Now my HMAC is supposed to be: 
HMAC = SHA_1(""\\\\\\....""+ SHA_1(""6666666....""))
but the result doesn't match. Instead it is: 
4DCF4B8D646EBD77EB704A9240BFA429078131A2 
What am I missing here? Does the empty message have to be padded as well? 
I suspect that I misinterpret the concatenation, but I am not sure what other options I have. Should I leave ipad and opad as hex? SHA1 methods receives string so I must convert to some sort of a string, I just can't figure out what type exactly.  
Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks in advance and Happy New Year!
","The problem with my method was so obvious, it's not even funny. While appending the result of the opad and inner hash I left the inner hash in hex format but treated it as ASCII, as a result 104 bytes were sent to the outer hash instead of 84. So the solution is something like: HMAC = SHA_1(opad + HexToASCII(SHA_1(ipad)));

When you creating an account by inserting into the table, you are using txtName.Text for the username, but when checking the credentials you are using txtUser.Text.
Why are you using a random salt?  Doesn't the salt have to be the same for every encryption?  I've pasted your code into a new project, and when I run the Compute method twice in a row for the same password, I get two different results... obviously that won't work.  Try passing in a salt value instead of Nothing, and use the same salt for creating accounts and comparing login.  Here's some sample code that works:
Dim thePass As String = ""MyPassword""
Dim theSalt As String = ""salt""

Dim pass As String = Compute(thePass, ""SHA512"", Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(theSalt))
Console.WriteLine(pass)
Dim pass2 As String = Compute(thePass, ""SHA512"", Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(theSalt))
Console.WriteLine(pass2) 'pass and pass2 are identical

","Unless I'm missing it (not really familiar with the language), you don't store the salt anywhere.
You have to use the same salt you've used when creating the account for the verification.
On a side note: You can either generate a random salt for every user account or use a fixed salt for all accounts. Either method works. The first is theoretically more secure, but if the salt is long enough, both are fine for practical purposes.

","The difference between those certificates is the strength of the hash function used for the digital signature created by the issuer of the certificate. SHA-1 is considered too weak since hash collision attacks are possible. Such a collision would allow the creation of a new certificate by the attacker which uses an existing signature and is thus considered trusted. The SHA-2 family of hash functions is considered strong enough and thus used today, mostly  with SHA-256.

I’m thinking about requiring a security digest that’s generated by hashing all request parameters plus a secret key with sha-256 and making the service only available over https. Can anyone tell me if this is sufficient security? 
","First of all, make sure you are using en HMAC, not a plain SHA-256 to generate the ""security digest"".
Next, what are you going to put into the input of this digest? You'll want to have at least the method, the URI, the payload, and very possibly most of the headers of the request (there are many headers that affect the meaning of an HTTP request that are important in a REST context). That might be difficult depending on what HTTP client you are using because the client might set or change headers in a way that you do not directly control.
Finally, where are you going to put this digest? A custom header (e.g. X-Request-Authenticator) seems sensible, or maybe a cookie if the client is running in a web browser.
I would recommend using existing tools if you can, instead of creating something yourself. Using SSL already gives you message integrity protection so start with that. Then, if you just need simple access control, HTTP basic auth will work just fine with a REST request. Or you could have the client present a certificate and verify it.

","SHA, as a hashing algorithm, is designed to prevent collisions. i.e. part of its power, and usefulness, is in limiting the strings which will hash to the same resultant value.
It sounds like you want to find a second string which will hash to the same hashed value as test123 hashes to. This kind of goes the intent of using SHA in the first place.
It is possible to brute force the values with SHA, i.e. given a hashed value, you can brute force the value that was hashed by computing hashes and comparing the hashed value to the target value. This will take some time. Other algorithms, such as bcrypt, are more difficult to brute force, but are more computationally expensive for you also.

","You're badly misunderstanding what a hash is for. It's a ONE WAY street by design. It's also designed to have a very low probability of 'collision' - two source values that hash to the same result. And by 'very low' I mean 'for practical purposes, it doesn't'. A constrained string - such as a password - simply won't do it. 
So what typically happens for passwords - my client takes my password, generates a hash, sends it to the server. 
The server compares that against it's list - if the hash matches, we assume that my password was correct. This means at no point is my password sent 'in the clear' nor is possible to work out what it was by grabbing the hash. 
To avoid duplicates showing up (e.g. two people with the same password) usually you'll hash some unique values. Simplistically - username + password, when hashed.
The purpose of authenticating against hashes, is to ensure the cleartext password is never required to be held anywhere - and that is all. You still need to secure you communication channel (to avoid replay attacks) and you still need to protect against brute force guessing of password. 
But brute forcing hashes is by design an expensive thing to attempt. You will see places where 'rainbow tables' exist, where people have taken every valid password string, and hashed it, so they can rapidly crack retrieved hashes from the server. These are big, and took a long time to generate initially though, and are defeated at least partially by salting or embedding usernames into the hash. 
But I cannot re-iterate strongly enough - don't ever hand roll your own security unless you're REALLY sure what's going on. You'll build in weaknesses that you didn't even know existed, and your only 'security' is that no one's bothered to look yet.

","This question is about vulnerability to Greasemonkey intercepting passwords, right?
In that case, SSL does nothing to protect against theft of the user's credentials, the password (or hash, or whatever) will be obtained right from the user's browser and transmitted to the bad guys via GM_xmlhttpRequest().
If you try to encode or hash the password, client-side, Greasemonkey can intercept or even replace the responsible JS.
See ""Can a website know if I am running a userscript?"", you can make it harder for a script writer but, ultimately, if the bad-guys can get the user to install a Greasemonkey script (or worse, a full-on add-on/extension) then you can only make it harder -- not impossible -- for the user's account to be compromised.
I wouldn't even worry about it until/unless you have evidence that a malicious script or add-on is in use.  Ultimately, the user is responsible for keeping his browser, and client-side interactions, secure.
Things you can do to make it harder (not impossible) for a scripter:

Monitor your logs, checking for unusual activity (should be doing this anyway).
Take protections against bots in general, see ""When the bots attack!"", for example.
Warn user(s) if an actual script or ploy is detected.  
Monitor the users' accounts/actions for unusual activity.
You can intercept the password, as it is typed, with JS and one-time encode some how.  This will filter out the causal scripters but not the determined ones. Note that I do not recommend this, just including it for completeness.
Put the password entry in a Flash dialog.  Pure Greasemonkey has a hard time interacting with Flash.  Again, I don't think this is cost-effective, but include it for completeness. 
Do NOT require any more tedious steps for legit users (one-time passwords, third channel authentication, etc.).  This will only annoy the ever-loving heck out of your victims until they find a better alternative or workarounds (which they will).

","No. Both are one-way hashes, so the information contained in the original source string is lost in the checksum.
Even if you do have the ""original"" string as you say, there will be some other data out there that when hashed, results in a collision. This is because MD5 and SHA1 are not perfect hash functions. In the case of MD5, each hash can potentially have an infinite number of collisions. Then there is no guarantee that the generated SHA checksum of the ""original"" string is actually what you seek.

Also I know it's known that SHA doesn't guarantee that it will always be unique but I don't see how it even comes close to being useful.
","A SHA-1 hash is 160 bits long. That gives you 2160, or exactly
1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976

possible hashes.
Assuming hash values are more or less unpredictable, the odds of two files accidentally having the same hash are infinitesimal to the point that it's just not worth worrying about it.
Quoting from Scott Chacon's book ""Pro Git"":

However, you should be aware of how ridiculously unlikely this
  scenario is. The SHA–1 digest is 20 bytes or 160 bits. The number of
  randomly hashed objects needed to ensure a 50% probability of a single
  collision is about 280.

...

Here’s an example to give you an idea of what it would take to get a
  SHA–1 collision. If all 6.5 billion humans on Earth were programming,
  and every second, each one was producing code that was the equivalent
  of the entire Linux kernel history (1 million Git objects) and pushing
  it into one enormous Git repository, it would take 5 years until that
  repository contained enough objects to have a 50% probability of a
  single SHA–1 object collision. A higher probability exists that every
  member of your programming team will be attacked and killed by wolves
  in unrelated incidents on the same night.

It's true that there must be two 21-byte files that have the same SHA-1 hash (since there are 2168 such files and only 2160 possible SHA-1 hashes). No such files have ever been discovered.
UPDATE : As of February 2017, two distinct PDF files with identical SHA-1 checksums have been generated, using a technique that's more than 100,000 times as fast as a brute force attack. Details here: https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html

","In fact, what I call your ""margin of safety"" determines how many objects you can store.
The widely quoted ""about 280"" number is the point at which you have approximately a 50% chance of a hash collision.  To keep the chance below about 1 out of 1018, the number of distinct objects in the repository should not exceed about 1.7 quadrillion (1.71x1015).
(I did some math for a book I'm working on; I haven't had it checked by a real mathematician, but when I ran the same sort of numbers against other hash sizes, my outputs agreed with those on Wikipedia, for whatever that's worth. :-) )
Edit to add: here's the approximation formula.  Let r be the cardinality of the hash function (so r is 2160 for SHA-1) and U be the desired probability-of-uniqueness (so U is 0.5 for the usual ""50% chance of safety, 50% chance of collision"" statistic.  The maximum number of hash inputs is:
(1 + sqrt(1 + 8r ln (1 / U)) / 2
The natural log of 1 / .5 is about 0.693, so we have about sqrt(4r)/2, which is of course just about sqrt(r).  Hence for a k-bit hash, ""50% probability of uniqueness"" occurs after about k/2 hashes.
To see (ballpark) how I get my number—in the neighborhood of 1015 objects—let U = 1 - 10-18.  The natural log of this number is basically the original 10-18, which means we knock most of 260 off the range r, leaving about 2100.  The square root of that is about 250 which is about 1015.

","The mistake being made is that the SHA code is not used to generate the contents of any files, the contents are stored by Git separately. The SHA code is just used as a key to a commit. The reason commits can't just have keys just numbered from 1 and increasing is because with Git different people can work on different branches of the same project making commits without knowing about each other. When these get merged together we still need commits to have unique keys. The best way of making it so the keys will definitely be unique is using something like SHA which creates a unique code and as others have explained the probability of getting the same key is almost zero.

That's going to print out something like [B@30a4effe which has nothing to do with the data in the byte array. You should print out hash instead - which should be the same for all calls, if your token is genuinely the same.
(As noted by Dan, your method is inappropriately named: hashing isn't encryption. Also, please don't catch Exception or just swallow exceptions like this. It seems pretty odd to just return token on failure, too.)
EDIT: As noted, I've assumed that Base64.encode actually returns a String, which it may not. I'd recommend this base64 implementation which is public domain and has a sensible API - the encoding calls return a String, which is entirely appropriate. Of course, you then don't need the explicit toString() call as well...

The scenario will be for password hashing and later verification. But it doesn't seem to work - I got two different blobs for the same input string. Is there anything wrong or missing with my code?

","I don't know what Base64 class you are using, but I will assume the one from Apache Commons. You are doing this:
String hash = Base64.encodeBase64(raw).toString();

Which is calling the toString method on whatever random byte array is returned from the Base64.encodeBase64() method. That is why your result is random every time, you are just returning an object reference as a String. Try this instead:
String hash = Base64.encodeBase64String(raw);

EDIT
As pointed out in another post, converting directly to String is probably a bad idea. I edited my answer slightly to reflect that.

But I have searched a lot on the internet and still unable to get a proper explanation on how using these keys will secure an API that you are using on an Android app?
For example, Facebook needs your SHA1 key from your system along with your app's package name to be entered on their developer console and their API doesn't work on your app if the key you entered is wrong. 
How does this mechanism work? How do they verify this on your App?
","Facebook is leveraging Android application signing functionality to provide the same type of assurance in the context of API interactions.
When building your application, your private key is being used to digitally sign the result. The signature validates that the build was created by the key owner and not subsequently modified.
Within the application, a signing certificate is stored, which is programmatically accessible.
In the Facebook SDK, the signing certificate is extracted using the PackageManager class. The resultant keyhash is provided as a parameter to API calls, where it is compared with the hash you provided via their Developer ste.
So, by providing the keyhash out-of-band (i.e. exporting it and entering on the developer site), Facebook is able to validate the in-band instance (i.e. compiled into the application and included in API requests).

","As the others said, the reason this is failing is that you're hashing the object's string representation. I expect the reason it's alternating is because the string representation includes the memory address the file object is stored at. When you do:
f = open(...)

you store that file object in f, pointing to memory X. When you do the same thing again, open() is called and allocates more memory. Since f is still pointing to memory X, that memory remains in use, and the second open() allocates new memory at Y instead. However, as soon as open() returns the result is assigned to f. Now the file object pointing to memory X is dangling and is garbage-collected. The next call to open() will reuse the memory at X since it's free now (this isn't guaranteed, but is common)

You could use Python strings (str) for both the input and the output.

"10070124","SHA2 - Why is it difficult (actually impossible without using brute-force) to recover the message if you have the Digest and the Key","I looked into the implementation of SHA2 in Python and it looks like it uses some default key for hashing. Once the key is known and the digest is known, is it possible to get the plain-text back? (pre-image attack without brute-force) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack
My intuition says NO as the block size (input size) is 512 bit and the output size is 256 bit. It means that to be a good hashing function (cryptographically) the function should be many to one function (non-invertible). {This is the exact opposite to the requirement of a block cipher where the function should be invertible (one to one).}
As far as I understood the requirement is to have random many-to-one function!
","It's impossible, even with Brute Force, to recover the plain text for a given hash because there are many texts that map to the same N-bit key (for any value of N).  That is, there are different messages that have the same digest value.

My search points me to: https://stackoverflow.com/a/18678325
I tested bcrypt and I was interested how it works.
The explanation at https://stackoverflow.com/a/6833165 points me to one question.
If $2a$10$ZaDBCZaI59IMdKuBiRdubuMa2h/itIYIwqLHpS1q245ISD90xsjkW contains all information about the type of encoding and the salt and so on, and this is stored in my database why is it save?
If someone has this ""hash"" he can easily decrypt it with brute force.
Within my previous project I used a SHA encode with a system wide secret salt. In this scenario the hash stole from the database can't easily be decrypted.
So why is bcrypt preferred to a SHA with system wide salt?
","2 points:

Bcrypt is designed to resist brute force attacks by having a configurable complexity that makes the process arbitrarily slow. Refer to wikipedia for more details
Using the same hash for all passwords, as your existing system does, may be vulnerable to differential attacks, since each password in the database is known to contain a shared component.

Basically i have the string i want to hash, I'm new to C in general so any pointers would be
great.
This is the string im trying to sha1 hash, I'v tried several approaches but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.
u8 *input = ""258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11"";

I almost have websockets working with G-wan and the last thing is getting this sha1 function to cooperate with me.
Documentation on G-wans sha1 function is below 
// u8 dst[20]; // the resulting 160-bit hash
// sha1_t ctx;
// sha1_init(&ctx);
// int i = 10;
// while(i--)
//    sha1_add(&ctx, data[i].ptr, data[i].len);
// sha1_end(&ctx, dst);

typedef struct { u8 x[220]; } sha1_t;
void sha1_init(sha1_t *ctx);
void sha1_add (sha1_t *ctx, u8 *src, int srclen);
void sha1_end (sha1_t *ctx, u8 *dst);
// a wrapper on all the above SHA-160 calls
void sha1(u8 *input, int ilen, u8 *dst);

Link to there api http://gwan.com/api
If anyone could throw me a bone here It would make my last hours with C a tad bit forgiving.
","Here's a sample on how to use sha1 function.
u8 input[] = ""258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11"";
u8 result[20];

sha1(input, sizeof(input) - 1, result);
xbuf_xcat(get_reply(argv), ""SHA1 Result: %20B"", result);

The result is binary so you need to convert it to B64 or HEX to make it readable.
'%B' is a B64 conversion in G-WAN. '%20B' tells it to convert the first 20 bytes.
Result:

"43682324","Swift: Signing with SHA256 not working like in amazon aws example","Hello I want to create a signature for amazon-aws with swift but the given example is resulting other hashes than my functions. 
The example is given here:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-v4-examples.html
and looks like this with JS:
var crypto = require(""crypto-js"");

function getSignatureKey(Crypto, key, dateStamp, regionName, serviceName) {
    var kDate = Crypto.HmacSHA256(dateStamp, ""AWS4"" + key);
    var kRegion = Crypto.HmacSHA256(regionName, kDate);
    var kService = Crypto.HmacSHA256(serviceName, kRegion);
    var kSigning = Crypto.HmacSHA256(""aws4_request"", kService);
    return kSigning;
}

The input is this:
key = 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY'
dateStamp = '20120215'
regionName = 'us-east-1'
serviceName = 'iam'

And it should result the following:
kSecret  = '41575334774a616c725855746e46454d492f4b374d44454e472b62507852666943594558414d504c454b4559'
kDate    = '969fbb94feb542b71ede6f87fe4d5fa29c789342b0f407474670f0c2489e0a0d'
kRegion  = '69daa0209cd9c5ff5c8ced464a696fd4252e981430b10e3d3fd8e2f197d7a70c'
kService = 'f72cfd46f26bc4643f06a11eabb6c0ba18780c19a8da0c31ace671265e3c87fa'
kSigning = 'f4780e2d9f65fa895f9c67b32ce1baf0b0d8a43505a000a1a9e090d414db404d'

So my swift solution looks like this:
    let kSecret = ""AWS4wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"".data(using: String.Encoding.utf8)?.hexEncodedString()
    let kDate = ""20120215"".hmac(algorithm: HMACAlgorithm.SHA256, key: kSecret!).data(using: String.Encoding.utf8)?.hexEncodedString()
    let kRegion = ""us-east-1"".hmac(algorithm: HMACAlgorithm.SHA256, key: kDate!).data(using: String.Encoding.utf8)?.hexEncodedString()
    let kService = ""iam"".hmac(algorithm: HMACAlgorithm.SHA256, key: kRegion!).data(using: String.Encoding.utf8)?.hexEncodedString()
    let kSigning = ""aws4_request"".hmac(algorithm: HMACAlgorithm.SHA256, key: kService!).data(using: String.Encoding.utf8)?.hexEncodedString()

But what I get as result is following:
kSecret: ""41575334774a616c725855746e46454d492f4b374d44454e472b62507852666943594558414d504c454b4559""
kDate: ""536c634e5047706e3276437146796a41722f677a6657637a68742b48364f755469772b72436363686868453d""
kRegion: ""416e524c31512b47434a624d4a2f4d4945755133574176622b65676c54475159576568674c6179414549383d""

So the first hash matches but after that none of them match. I even think maybe the SHA256 encoding is not correctly because SHA256 encoding and parsing to hex will always result this length of hashes. But in the given example the hashes are not that long. 
What is the problem here?

        }
        return CCHmacAlgorithm(result)
    }

this obviously depends on your use-case; git bundle only makes sense if you transfer a changeset from one git-repository to another, whereas git format-patch creates standard diff-files which can be inspected easily and applied to a non-gitified source tree as well.
on the other hand git bundle creates a single file, which is easier to transport than the multi-file output of git format-patch

","Reposting my earlier comment (extended).
What you do is:

Read bytes
Convert them to characters
Split the character stream to lines
Store those lines into a list
Again concatenate those lines into a string
Take its bytes again
Compute hash of those bytes

Steps 2-6 seem unnecessary. I would recommend to read bytes from your initial FileInputStream in chunks (for example, of 4k) and feed them to the MessageDigest for update. That would just perform steps 1 and 7.
InputStream is = new FileInputStream(fileName);
byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];
while (true) {
    int read = is.read(buffer);
    if (read < 0) {
        break;
    }
    md.update(buffer, 0, read);
}
is.close(); // better be done in finally

"50282136","How do I represent uint8 literals in Java","I am trying to re-implement some code that uses libsodium in Java.
The original code declares an array of type uint8:
#define SECRET ((uint8_t[]){ 0xAA, 0xBB, 0xCC ... }) // not the real secret!

and feeds that to libsodium's crypto_hash_sha256_update
My challenge in implementing this in Java is that Java has no unsigned bytes, so I can't actually type 0xAA as a byte.
Things I've tried:

Declaring my array as short/int: I think this breaks because of 0 padding
Declaring the literals as 0b11110000... format, this doesn't give the right answers (I have some test data from the original implementation)
Declaring an array of char [] and concatenating the literals: final char[] salt = { 0xAABB, 0xCCDD, ...}`, doesn't give right answers either

EDIT
this is my short attempt
    final short[] salt = { 0xAA, 0xBB, ...};


    final Hasher hasher = Hashing.sha256().newHasher();
    hasher.putLong(input);
    for (int i=0; i < salt.length; i++) {
        hasher.putShort(salt[i]);

"6671926","Using an HMAC on an a already hashed value, good or bad practice?","Hi all I have a question on if this is good practice or not.  I am aware that simply double hashing a value can be bad for various reasons.
What I would like to do would be something like this, in php.
$val = hash_hmac('sha256', md5($password), $salt);

The reason for this is that we are authenticating with a trusted partner over a closed api.  The passwords are stored as an MD5 hash in our DB.  However, I don't want our partner to send this same value across the net.
This way I can compare the md5'd password inside our database to unique hash that our partner has sent.
What say ye?
","First of all, is this a user password (ie, you are authenticating on-behalf-of a user), or a shared secret between your two servers?
If it's a user password, stop. You are saving passwords in plaintext (or as an unsalted md5). Either way is bad. Save passwords as a salted hash and use OAuth or something to authenticate instead.
If it's a shared secret between two servers (not representing a user), you can still use oauth or something, but if you just want something simple, you should authenticate like this:
$val = hash_hmac('sha256', $nonce, $secret);

$nonce is a one-time-value chosen by the server randomly to prevent replay attacks.
Keep in mind that if you don't have a nonce, then whatever value you send across is your shared secret. It doesn't matter if you derive it from a hmac of a md5 or whatever; if it ends up being the same each time, it is equivalent to a password sent across the communications channel. And remember to secure the communications channel from MITMs as well!

","Yes, the code should be unique, unless you're generating more than one per user per second. It's also terrifically predictable. If an attacker knows the id of a user and the rough time of when the code is being generated, it's trivial to guess the code. If the attacker is allowed an unlimited number of guesses, even the rough time doesn't really matter, as he could easily try all valid codes for the last couple of years.

"50985829","Generate HMAC SHA Algorithm using URI and Key","I wrote a Java program which generates HMAC SHA hash code, But due to some reason I have to write the same code in NodeJs/JavaScript. I tried googling around but did not get anything. In this Java code, I am passing URI and Key as arguments, to generate the hash code, where URI contains Timestamp. 
The java code is as :
    public static String calcMAC(String data, byte[] key) throws Exception {
    String result=null;
    SecretKeySpec signKey = new SecretKeySpec(key, SecurityConstants.HMAC_SHA1_ALGORITHM);
    Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(SecurityConstants.HMAC_SHA1_ALGORITHM);
    mac.init(signKey);
    byte[] rawHmac;
    try {
        rawHmac = mac.doFinal(data.getBytes(""US-ASCII""));
        result = Base64.encodeBase64String(rawHmac);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return result.trim();
}

public static void main(String args[]) {
    String timestamp = args[0];
    String key = ""d134hjeefcgkahvg32ajkdbaff84ff180"";
    String out = null;
    try {
        out = calcMAC(""/req?app_id=47ca34"" + timestamp + ""=2018-05-22T12:02:15Z"", 
                key.getBytes());
        System.out.println(URLEncoder.encode(out, ""UTF-8""));
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}

Is it possible to achieve the same goal in NodeJs/JavaScript?
Note:: I have to call this script from Postman pre-request script.
","The crypto module should do this for you, you can substitute the 'data' variable with whatever you want to hash: 
const crypto = require('crypto');

const data = 'The fault dear Brutus lies not in our stars';
const key = Buffer.from('d134hjeefcgkahvg32ajkdbaff84ff180', 'utf8');

const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha1', key).update(data).digest('base64');
const uriEncodedHash = encodeURIComponent(hash);
console.log('Hash: ' + uriEncodedHash);

Hashing the data in both Java and Node.js gives me the result (URI Encoded) of:
TJJ3xj93m8bfVpGoucluMQqkB0o%3D

The same Java code would be:
public static void main(String args[]) {
    String data = ""The fault dear Brutus lies not in our stars"";
    String key = ""d134hjeefcgkahvg32ajkdbaff84ff180"";
    String out = null;
    try {
        out = calcMAC(data, key.getBytes());
        System.out.println(URLEncoder.encode(out, ""UTF-8""));
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}

Again, we can put anything into 'data' we want.

"33540897","Deprecation of SHA-1 Hashing Algorithm for Microsoft Root Certificate Program","
Microsoft Security Advisory 2880823 has been released along with the
  policy announcement that Microsoft will stop recognizing the validity
  of SHA-1 based certificates after 2016.  

Does it mean that all signatures created with SHA1 algorithm will be not valid?
Or only certificates used the SHA-1 algorithm will be not valid in newer operation systems?  
","The latter.
It would be very strange if the cryptographic security provider would not be able to handle PKCS#1 signatures with SHA1 anymore. What will happen is that certificate chain validation will not allow the SHA-1 signature to be used for certificate verification (except for the trusted/root certificate, because these are explicitly trusted in the first place).
As stated in the advisory:

The new policy will no longer allow root certificate authorities to issue X.509 certificates using the SHA-1 hashing algorithm for the purposes of SSL and code signing after January 1, 2016.

This seems to only affect intermediate CA certificates although I would not be surprised if e.g. IE would also disallow the use of SHA-1 for chain validation for lower intermediate CA's and end user certificates.
The updates also indicate that Microsoft won't allow any certificates to be signed using SHA-1 within a chain for TLS.
As for the ""newer operating systems"" part of the question: I would expect policy change to be implemented for all supported platforms (at the time the change is introduced).

Note that the use of SHA-1 for signature verification will be pretty dangerous, especially if the contents can be controlled. This is very much the case when the signature is used for non-repudiation. It is much less the case if the signature is used for e.g. challenge verification in a challenge response protocol where the input is ephemeral and generated by the party that performs the verification.

Upgrading security on a users table. Converting all existing passwords using sqls built in hashbytes pw, for now not using salt until I can get this working.
Table: admin has 4 records
Current password: admin.password='test'
update admin 
set passwordenc = hashbytes('SHA2_256', password);

passwordenc is of type varbinary(50).
Entry now:
admin.passwordenc is 0x9F86D081884C7D659A2FEAA0C55AD015A3BF4F1B2B0B822CD15D6C15B0F00A08

which is what I want.
I have a .net cshtml website with login, some code:
var uname = Request[""username""];
var upass = Request[""password""];
var adsql = ""select user_id, firstname, surname, profile, username from admin where username=@0 and passwordenc= hashbytes('SHA2_256', @1) "";

No records are found.
In dev tools in Chrome I can see that 'admin' is passed across for username, and 'test' for the password.
SQL Server Profiler shows:
exec sp_executesql N'select user_id, firstname, surname, profile, username from admin where username=@0 and passwordenc= hashbytes(''SHA2_256'', @1) ',
                   N'@0 nvarchar(5),@1 nvarchar(4)',@0=N'admin',@1=N'test'

In my app, if I try this:
var adsql = ""select user_id, firstname, surname, profile, username from admin where username=@0 and passwordenc=hashbytes('SHA2_256', '""+ upass+""') "";

It works. 
And the profile log
exec sp_executesql N'select user_id, firstname, surname, profile, username from admin where username=@0 and passwordenc=hashbytes(''SHA2_256'', ''test'') ',N'@0 nvarchar(5),@1 nvarchar(4)',@0=N'admin',@1=N'test'

Similarly, if I do this 
var adsql = ""select user_id, firstname, surname, profile, username from admin where username=@0 and passwordenc= 0x9F86D081884C7D659A2FEAA0C55AD015A3BF4F1B2B0B822CD15D6C15B0F00A08 "";

passing a hardcoded hash it also works. 
So passing 'test' in a non parameterised was works, as does checking the hash, but @1 doesn't, and can't see nowt wrong in profiler. Have tried faffing about with the convert function incase its checking a string against a binary but get same results.
What daft thing am I doing wrong?

","To access APIs in Android from Google API console you need to generate an API Key. This same API key can be used for accessing multiple APIs under the same project. To generate an API key you require, SHA1 fingerprint of your keystore. Keystore is basically a place where the private keys for your app are kept. In simple words its a certificate generated by a user or a program, used for signing an Android app.
In Android, there are two types of keystores. A debug keystore and a release keystore. Debug keystore is generated automatically when the Android SDK is installed or run for the first time. Release keystore has to be generated manually by the user for each application before release. As it requires private information such as name, password etc. To obtain an Android SHA1 fingerprint from your desired keystore.

UPDATE: As @Alex-Info.net pointed out, changing the double quotes to single quotes will treat the \v as a string, but unfortunately I can't change the PHP in this instance.
","As I said, I'd favor chaing your PHP code to match the online/commandline apps. Single quotes will not escape, and gets the results you mentionned.

echo -e -n ""\v"" | openssl dgst -sha256 , -e enables escaping.

","While I'm not sure about the specifics of how you want to simplify things, generally simplifying a cryptographic algorithm for non-cryptographic purposes is just fine provided you document very clearly that your use of a cryptographic primitive does not imply any cryptographic strength in the resulting code.
Normally you might implement the exact specification so that you can verify it against a third-party reference (ensuring that the code is connected as expected and that no data is discarded, etc.), and then reduce the number of rounds so it goes much faster.
A common motivation for doing this is when you have access to hardware acceleration for a cryptographic algorithm.
However, if your input is a fixed-length 64 bits then sha256 is typically more trouble than it's worth.
You haven't specified the size of the state of the PRNG.  If it's bigger than 64 bits then you probably just want to seed a simple 64-bit PRNG with your seed and then use that iteratively to fill in the larger PRNG state buffer.  If it's exactly 64-bits then something like the mix function of MurmurHash might be sufficient.

You can see the correct value calculated below using Python;
Calculated With Python
I've also calculated the correct value using the R command line tool.  This leads me to believe that Alteryx is somehow altering the input and as a result is producing the wrong output. Has anyone come across this or know a possible workaround. 
My R tool script follows:

where c =

","If you replace all \ with \\ in your input string (in regular R or Python), it will digest to the value starting with ""7fe..."" so this suggests that indeed, Alteryx is doing something like that in the hand-off to R.
A work-around would be to run it through the Alteryx base64 tool prior to the R tool, then have the R tool base 64 decode, something like: 
library(""digest"")
library(""caTools"")
df <- as.data.frame(read.Alteryx(""#1"", mode=""data.frame""))
df$out <- digest(base64decode(as.character(df$b64),what=""character""), algo='sha256', serialize = FALSE)
write.Alteryx(df, 1)

","MD5 and SHA are hash functions, they create fingerprint - fixed-length representation - from the bunch of data. For example, they are extensively used as a way to check consistency of your iso image downloads for many open-source products, but this means you can use them to create fingerprints from any selection of bytes. So they do not encrypt.
If you want to encrypt, you should check for encryption algorithms. The most feasible now I believe is AES (Advanced encryption Standard) if you look for symmetric encryption algorithms (eg. where key for encryption and decryption is the same or easily computed one from another) or RSA if you look for asymmetric (where you have 2 keys - public and private, and compute private key from public is hard task).
If you are about to create digital signatures, you may want to check things like DSA (digital signature algorithm) and ECDSA (DSA over elliptic curves.). Note that asymmetric algorithms work over numbers with extended precision - like 512, 1024, 2048 bits and so on. You need special libraries that can handle such numbers. If you use C++ I can recommend you trying Crypto++. Find something similar for other languages. 
I hope this was useful for you.

","If your data is password and you want to store it some where then Use MD5 or SHA Hash.
There are two advantages of these. 

A hash can not be decrypted to recover old value so your password will never ever will be cracked even if you provide MD5/SHA hash of password to some one :) 
A hash of particular string will be always same so you can compare passwords based on Hash.

AES :

Symmetric algorithm so faster
Use with PKCS5Padding and CBC mode 
Always store IV
Symmetric so you need same key while you are decrypting encrypted text so you can not at all share keys.

RSA

PKI Infrastructure to exchange Keys
Slow

There are other algorithms also Like DES(Not So Secure), 3DES(Often called Tripple DES- Not enough secure compared to DES)

Elsewhere it is said that the 1 is needed to make the padding Merkle–Damgård-compliant (MD-compliant) but unless something really eluded me the size feild at the end is clearly suffiscient. 
see: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%E2%80%93Damg%C3%A5rd_construction#MD-compliant_padding
Finally a source wrote that this was necessary to process an empty string (why?) and another to make the padding reversible (what for?).
I'm always suspicious when I find so many different explainations. Can anyone explain me this with an example.
BTW, this padding is defined in ISO/IEC 9797-1 as Padding Method 2 (with no explainations).

","This is the problem:
hexString.append(Integer.toHexString(0xFF & bytes[i]));

This will lose any leading 0s - in other words, any byte less than 16 will come out as a single hex digit instead of two.
There are plenty of fixes for this. For example:

Manually append 0 if the value is between 0 and 15 (ick)
Use String.format(""%02x"", bytes[i] & 0xff)
Use a full ""byte array to hex conversion"" method in a utility library (there are loads around)

In your PHP version, $sha = hash_update($sha, $user); was bad because hash_update returns a boolean. The first argument is called the context and is the result of hash_init, the second one is the data to hash. Finally, you call hash_final with the last parameter (raw_output) to true to get binary data.
Last error, using openssl_digest on the SHA result's was computing the digest of the SHA digest's. Funny, isn't it? :).

"40190282","Generate C* bucket hash from multipart primary key","I will have C* tables that will be very wide. To prevent them to become too wide  I have encountered a strategy that could suit me well. It was presented in this video.
Bucket Your Partitions Wisely
The good thing with this strategy is that there is no need for a ""look-up-table"" (it is fast), the bad part is that one needs to know the max amount of buckets and eventually end up with no more buckets to use (not scalable). I know my max bucket size so I will try this.
By calculating a hash from the tables primary keys this can be used as a bucket part together with the rest of the primary keys.
I have come up with the following method to be sure (I think?) that the hash always will be the same for a specific primary key.
Using Guava Hashing:
public static String bucket(List<String> primKeyParts, int maxBuckets) {

    StringBuilder combinedHashString = new StringBuilder();
    primKeyParts.forEach(part ->{
        combinedHashString.append(
            String.valueOf(
                Hashing.consistentHash(Hashing.sha512()
                    .hashBytes(part.getBytes()), maxBuckets)
            )
        );
    });
    return combinedHashString.toString();
}

The reason I use sha512 is to be able to have strings with max characters of 256 (512 bit) otherwise the result will never be the same (as it seems according to my tests).
I am far from being a hashing guru, hence I'm asking the following questions.
Requirement: Between different JVM executions on different nodes/machines the result should always be the same for a given Cassandra primary key?

Can I rely on the mentioned method to do the job?
Is there a better solution of hashing large strings so they always will produce the same result for a given string?
Do I always need to hash from string or could there be a better way of doing this for a C* primary key and always produce same result?

Please, I don't want to discuss data modeling for a specific table, I just want to have a bucket strategy.
EDIT:
Elaborated further and came up with this so the length of string can be arbitrary. What do you say about this one?
public static int murmur3_128_bucket(int maxBuckets, String... primKeyParts) {

    List<HashCode> hashCodes = new ArrayList();
    for(String part : primKeyParts) {
        hashCodes.add(Hashing.murmur3_128().hashString(part, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
    };
    return Hashing.consistentHash(Hashing.combineOrdered(hashCodes), maxBuckets);
}

","I currently use a similar solution in production. So for your method I would change to:
public static int bucket(List<String> primKeyParts, int maxBuckets) {
  String keyParts = String.join("""", primKeyParts);
  return Hashing.consistentHash(
                     Hashing.murmur3_32().hashString(keyParts, Charsets.UTF_8),
                     maxBuckets);
}

So the differences

Send all the PK parts into the hash function at once.
We actually set the max buckets as a code constant since the consistent hash is only if the max buckets stay the same.
We use MurMur3 hash since we want it to be fast not cryptographically strong.

For your direct questions 1) Yes the method should do the job. 2) I think with the tweaks above you should be set. 3) The assumption is you need the whole PK? 
I'm not sure you need to use the whole primary key since the expectation is that your partition part of your primary key is gonna be the same for many things which is why you are bucketing. You could just hash the bits that will provide you with good buckets to use in your partition key. In our case we just hash some of the clustering key parts of the PK to generate the bucket id we use as part of the partition key.

","TL;DR: you are safe unless you mix VCSes.

The problem statement in your question is not quite right in the first place:

... it appears what very unlikely what two different commits in git will have same hash.

and this (indirectly) leads to a faulty further assumption:

But what about all commits not only git? My application working with git,svn,hg - can i assume that there will be no different commits with same hash?

Even if all VCSes were perfect, you could not really make this assumption.  Even if all VCSes were both perfect and used the same hash algorithm, you still could not make this assumption.  But for your particular problem, there is a much simpler (albeit imperfect) answer.

For now i'm trying to deside how stop my application from creation same commits from different forks of one repo in db ...

The main thing to consider here is the concept of ""forks of one repo"", and how you are going to identify a particular commit.
If we look at the identity of a commit in Git or Mercurial, we find that it is a hash ID.
Two objects in Git that have the same object-ID are the same object, by definition, because Git will store any object only once.  This is because the underlying storage model for Git is a simple key-value store, with the key being a hash ID.  There is only one value stored under any single key.
To allow for the four object types in Git—commit, annotated tag, tree, and blob—Git stores the object's type in a header prepended to all objects.  It makes the assumption that prepending the string commit <size>\0 to some data results in a different hash than prepending the string blob <size>\0 to the same data.  This assumption is largely true, though the pigeonhole principle tells us that there must be some data for which it is false.  (To the extent that SHA-1 is good, the chance of finding a data-pair that generates a collision is 1 in 2160.  The Stevens et al work shows that SHA-1 is not that good.)
In any case, though, Git's underlying storage model means that once a key has an associated value, that key/value pair is now occupied, and no pair with the same key can be stored again.  Hence, if some existing key k exists, and has type commit and represents some commit, no new object of any type with key k can be added to the repository database (at least not without first removing the existing object with key k).
What this means is that if you make the assumption that commits are not removed, and if you have seen that key k exists before in any clone of this repository, any other clone with key k has the same object.  The hash, in other words, is the object, in a very real sense.
This is not necessarily the case in Mercurial.  Mercurial's database can store new commits that have duplicate keys (the simple local sequence number associated with each object can disambiguate them).  However, such commits can never be transferred from one repository to another (and are likely to cause other problems), so you are certainly allowed to assume the problem away if the repository will be distributed.
Currently, both Git and Mercurial use SHA-1 as well—but they use them in different ways.  That is, the input message on which the hash is computed differs in Git vs Mercurial.  What this means is that if you have ""forks"" G (stored via Git) and M (stored via Mercurial) that represent the same repository, the keys kG in G are (numerically) unrelated to the keys kM in M.
Therefore, if you allow two different forks to use two different underlying VCSes, you cannot make the assumption that two different keys represent two different objects, nor that two identical keys represent the same object.  If you constrain them to the same VCS, though, you may make this assumption.
(SVN does not identify commits by hashes at all.  Since SVN repositories are centralized, they can and do use a simple unique integer to represent each commit.  By converting the SVN repository to a Git repository, however, you impose the Git restrictions: you now have a repository that meets any restrictions imposed by both VCSes.  Should someone add a new commit to the SVN repository that cannot be represented correctly in the Git repository, it simply never goes into the Git repository at all.)

","No, there are no out of band hash values for MD5, SHA-1 or one of the SHA-2 candidates. The output of cryptograhic hashes is guaranteed to be indistinguishable from random. That said, if you generate a value of the same size as e.g. SHA-256 (32 bytes) that is not already a known hash, then you are guaranteed that nobody else will generate the same value. This could even be 32 bytes set to all zeros. There are endless messages that will generate the hash value you chose, the point is that it is impossible to find one.
If anybody would be able to generate a hash that has the same value then they would be able to generate a collision. If a collision can be generated then the cryptographic hash is considered broken. MD5 does have collisions and is considered broken. For SHA-1 there have been no collisions yet, but the amount of work required to generate one is lower than expected for a hash with 160 bit output, and possibly already inside reach. Neither MD5 or SHA1 is currently so broken that you would be able to generate any random hash value, but attacks only get better, not worse.
So in the end you would be best off choosing SHA-256 or SHA-512 for this particular purpose. Note that although you can use just X leftmost bytes of the output, you should use at least 160 bits or so to be reasonably sure that there is no collision - for non-broken hash algorithms the output size determines the chance of collisions.

In this example, both dynamic queries return 'true'.

It might just be bad luck that they are currently returning the same results.
(just uncomment the monkeywrench record to get false from both)
Also, about the FOR XML. When one of the ORDER BY is different, then the resulting XML and HASH will also be different.  
While with an EXCEPT you can only add an ORDER BY at the end, because it sorts the combined resultset.

These get encoded as &amp;, &lt;, &gt; and &quot;, respectively. Since there is a special character in the encoded value, you can see double-encoding happening by looking for things like &amp;lt; as we see in your sample XML.

"16634295","Password security","Currently I am using a particular scheme for securing passwords, and I think I have some points for improvement. The implementation is in Java, so I prefer to use SHA-2 512 as encryption form.
Currently I have a client-server model, so these things can happen:

Client wants to login, he sends his password with one time normal SHA-2 512 encryption over the network.
The server has the passwords stored in the database as for example SHA-2_512(SHA-2_512(password) + salt), with the inner SHA-2_512(password) being the 'encrypted' password it receives over the network.
Password checks are done server side and there is no way anything can leak out from the server, the only possible vulnerability would be if someone could read out the RAM I think.

I have these questions:

An attacker usually creates collision attacks when wanting to hack a password. However how are collision attacks sufficient? If the password needs to be used for other applications like Outlook.com, Facebook or whatever (which likely use another salt as they have nothing to do with my applications), how is a collision attack enough then? Don't you need the real password?
Does SHA-2 512 already use iteration? And even if so, should I change my encryption methods to automatically use a number of iterations plus how many iterations is preferred? I have also read about using a random number of iterations (in a range), how do I store the random factor determenistically?
Should I store system secrets for every iteration in the server code? See http://blog.mozilla.org/webappsec/2011/05/10/sha-512-w-per-user-salts-is-not-enough/ . I could store an array which would hold a static secret for every iteration, with the nth secret being for the nth iteration. Nobody can know the secrets, they are computed once (I guess as encrypting some random string), and then basically stored in the Server's RAM.
Currently I send the typed password from the client to the server as just SHA-2_512(password), should this process be improved, and if so, how? I cannot use salts, because the client does not have the salt available.

Regards.
","TLDR: You need to send the password using an encrypted channel, such as TLS.  Consider using bcrypt for password hashing.
SHA-2 512 is not an encryption algortihm, it is a message digest algorithm.  An encryption algorithm requires a key and a message to encrypt.  It produces ciphertext.  The important thing is that an encryption algorithm has a decryption algorithm.
ciphertext = E(key, plaintext);
plaintext = D(key, ciphertext);

A message digest takes a piece of plaintext and produces a message digest.  There is no corresponding reverse mechanism to take a message digest and retrieve the original message.  There is also no secret key.
digest = hash(plaintext);

If an attacker is able to access a database with hashes, the attacker can retrieve the original password by brute forcing, trying lots of guesses with the hash algorithm.
digest1 = hash(guess1);
digest2 = hash(guess2);    //repeat with lots of guesses

Firstly, sending a hash over a network is not secure.  It needs to be sent through some secure communications mechanism such as SSL.  If an attacker can intercept the hash over the communications they may be able to work out the orignal password.
A hash collision is not the same as brute forcing the password.  A hash collision is caused when two different messages produce the same message digest.
digest1 = hash(plaintext1);
digest2 = hash(plaintext2);
if ( ( plaintext1 != plaintext2 ) && ( digest1 == digest2 ) )  
    // hash collision

SHA-512 does not have iterations designed to prevent brute-forcing.  The SHA set of algorithms are designed to be efficient.  The reason for adding iterations when hashing passwords is to increase the time it takes to brute force a password.  The idea being the cost to perform a legitimate login attempt and perform 100 iterations is tiny compared to an attacker who has millions of passwords, each of which requires 100 iterations.  Adding more iterations helps reduce the impact of improved processor speeds (which would help an attacker try more iterations quicker).
You should make the number of iterations a configurable limit that is stored against each user.  So you store the password hash, salt and iteration count for each user.  This means that in the future you can increase the number of iterations to take into account increased hardware power.
Sending the SHA-2 512 in plaintext is not secure.  You should send it within an encrypted channel, such as SSL.
Having said all that, SHA-2 is not designed to be a password hashing algorithm.  It is designed for message validation and is to be efficient.  Consider using a purpose built password hashing algorithm.  One example is bcrypt.  It is designed to be computationally difficult and has salt and iterations built in.

","The short answer is: you can't.
The long answer is: you can, but only with vast amounts of computation power.  The entire purpose of hash algorithms is to make it hard to find collisions.  If it were easy to find a collision, then there'd be little point in using the hash algorithm.
To solve your test problem, I suggest abstracting away the file-reading/hash-computing part of your application into a separate class, and then mocking it with a fake hash implementation in order to test the rest of the application.

"11059773","Where does hashing take place with a webclient and LDAP","We are currently implementing several web application that requires the user to create a user login that will be authenticated through LDAP calls. The LDAP server and user accounts will be shared by all the applications and the user's credentials will be the same across all applications.
My question is where does the hashing take place in a standard LDAP scenario, on the client side or does the LDAP server take care of it. It was my understanding that the LDAP server takes in a user password, at the time of creation, and hashes it and stores it. (By the by we plan on using salted SHA512 hashing and SSL connections between the client > webserver > LDAp server)
It was my understanding that the hashing operation takes place centrally on the LDAP server, relieving the client of the trouble and avoiding any breakage on the client end to affect other apps.
","Modern, professional-quality servers use storage schemes for password attributes (usually userPassword and authPassword) that involve executing the hash on the server. Servers usually append or prepend a unique value (called a salt) to a password, then execute the hash function. The ""salt"" minimizes the effectiveness of dictionary attacks, that is, dictionaries are more difficult to create for salted, hashed passwords.
SSL (a secure connection) should be used, or a non-secure connection should be promoted using the StartTLS extended request. An encrypted connection should be used so that passwords can be transmitted in the clear with BIND requests. Passwords that are transmitted in the clear over a secure connection can be checked for history and quality by the servers' password policy enforcement mechanisms. For servers that enforce password history and quality checks, passwords should not be transmitted pre-encoded. Therefore, it is not so much the ""trouble"" to the LDAP client as it is the fact that the server can enforcement organization-wide and agreed-to password quality and history checks in a central location.

"18077729","Hashing and using time as salt to prevent access from un-authorized system and replay attacks","I am currently writing a user authentication API for a mobile game. I'd want to make sure that the user can only access the system from the mobile app. (That is, the server has to deny access if the Server API is accessed from browser or CURL (un-authorized system) even though the exact POST parameters are valid). Ideally, the system should not allow replay attacks as well.
Does anybody have idea or example of how this can be done?
I am thinking of adding a unique-per-user salt with current timestamp and SHA256-ing the parameters with a private key on the client app, which will then be validated on the server. This way will prevent the access from browser or CURL as attackers will need to get the private key in order to compute the SHA256 hash. The salt (which includes timestamp) will also be sent as one of the params, and the server will get the timestamp and deny access if it is past a certain time. But I am not very sure about the security and whether it is the common or correct practice, as I've never design secured app, or seen the source code of one before.
Thanks for your input!
","This will stop users from intercepting requests on network and using them with CURL. But both private key and signature algorithm can be extracted for your app and reimplemented, so this solution will not be totally secure. 
Alas, you can't have complete security here without some custom tamper-resistant hardware issued to users.

","Hashing the files in this case will only be slower. Consider the following case.
File A.txt contents:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

File B.txt contents:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBB

Note that A.txt is 40 characters total, 10 characters longer than B.txt at 30 characters
How much I/O do we have to do on each file to determine if A.txt contains all of B.txt? 40 bytes? 30 bytes? No, the answer is only 20 bytes, because that's how much the two files share have in common. You stream each file one byte (or chunk of bytes) at a time and compare them as you go. The results of such a comparison looks like this:
A.txt: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

B.txt: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBB

Stream ---------------------^
Result ✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓X

And then you stop. Why compare the rest?
If you hash both files, you have to have the whole contents in memory to compute the hash. Even if you hash them in chunks while streaming them into memory, which do you think is faster: comparing each byte from each file or hashing the chunk? The complexity of the comparison is O(number of bytes) whereas the complexity of the SHA-1 hash algorithm is specified by RFC 3174.

Also how would i validate a log in if the password is sha+salt encrypted.
","Being the salt just a random string added to the hash of the string you want to encode, there are enough ways to generate it [e.g. this on SO].
You don't need and you can't decrypt any sha result because sha [like md5] is an hashing algorithm, not a crypt function, i.e. it's not meant to hide anything for later retrieval: this is important because I don't want the admin of a site I am registered to to read my password from database.
To hash is to map elements from a data set to shorter elements from another one, in an [almost total] injective way - you map arbitrary long strings to fixed-length keys: this lets you make comparison in the hashed domain without actually knowing the original value.
hash( value1 ) = hash ( value2 ) => value1 = value2

I said almost because hashing algorithms have some collisions [e.g. exceptions to previous statement such as hash(value1) = hash(value2) does not imply the 2 values being the same] - salts help in this regard too.
This said, this is how you save the password to db:

generate the salt;
prepend the salt to the actual password: it's important to put it before the pwd to prevent dictionary attacks;
hash the concatenated string with a proper algorithm [I chose sha1 just for example's sake];
save both the string and the salt to db.

In code:
$user -> salt = your_salt_generator();
$user -> hashedPwd = hash('sha1', $salt . $userChosenPwd);

Pwd checking against $username / $password is just:

get user with given $username from db;
if it exists, use process above with saved salt and given password and check if it equals stored hash.

In code:
hash('sha1', $user -> salt . $sentPassword) == $user -> hashedPwd;


About hiding values in URLs, it's more a SEO / readability topic than a security one: URLs should be made upon routing [e.g. http://somesite.com/products/:id to access the id-th product], and your server logic should not be vulnerable to stuff put into requests that are made to your site [regardless to totally crap cases I can't come with right now].

Regarding MySQL injections, we got rid of them since prepared statements from PDO extension.
There are millions of answers about this around SO, just have a look around.
Keep it up with your work!

In the wikipedia stands that the initial hash values are given by the fractional parts of the square roots of the first 8 primes 2..19. Now i am trying to calculate them. What i have done so far:
#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>

// fill primes with all prime values between min and max value

  for (uint32_t value = min; value <= max; value++)
  {

    uint32_t tmp;
    for (tmp = 2; tmp <= sqrt(value); tmp++)  // start to check with 2, because 1 is always going to work
    {
      if (value % tmp == 0)
      {
        break;
      }
    }
    if (tmp > sqrt(value)) primes->push_back(value);   // if no other integer divisor is found, add number to vector
  }

  return 0;
}

int main()
{
  std::vector<uint32_t> primes;

  getPrimes(2, 20, &primes);  // fills vector with all prime values between 2 and 20

  double tmp = sqrt(primes[0]);                       // get square root, returns double
  printf(""value %f\n"", tmp);                          // debug
  printf(""size of double %i\n"", sizeof(double));      // get representation byte size
  double * tmpOffset = &tmp;                          // get value offset
  unsigned char   * tmpChar   = (unsigned char*)tmpOffset;              // convert to char pointer

  printf(""address of variable %i\n"", &tmp);           // debug

Edit:
Thanks for your help! It is not pretty but does work for now.
  printf(""raw fractional part:\n0x%02X %02X %02X %02X %02X %02X %02X\n"",
         (uint8_t)(0xf & tmpChar[6]), (uint8_t)tmpChar[5], (uint8_t)tmpChar[4], (uint8_t)tmpChar[3],

  uint32_t fracPart = (0xf & tmpChar[6]);
  fracPart <<= 8;
  fracPart |= tmpChar[5];
  fracPart <<= 8;
  fracPart |= tmpChar[4] ;
  fracPart <<= 8;
  fracPart |= tmpChar[3];
  fracPart <<= 4;
  fracPart |= (0xf0 & tmpChar[2]) >> 4;
  printf(""fractional part: %X\n"", fracPart);

Edit2
A little bit of a nicer implementation:
  uint32_t fracPart2 = *(uint32_t*)((char*)&tmp + 3);     // point to fractional part - 4 bit
  fracPart2 <<= 4;                                        // shift to correct value
  fracPart2 |= (0xf0 & *((char*)&tmp + 2)) >> 4;          // append last 4 bit
  printf(""beautiful fractional part: %X\n"", fracPart2);

This solution is highly platform dependant and in a second approach i am going for something like in the link of comment 2.
Edit3
So this is my final solution, which does not depend on the internal representation of a double and calculates the fraction just using math.
uint32_t getFractionalPart(double value)
{
  uint32_t retValue = 0;

  for (uint8_t i = 0; i < 8; i++)
  {
    value = value - floor(value);
    retValue <<= 4;
    value *= 16;
    retValue += floor(value);
  }

  return retValue;
}

","One thing to keep in mind is that the double here is 64 bits. 
If you look at the IEEE representation of doubles at the below link, it has 1 sign bit, 11 exponent bits and the remaining are the precision bits.
Now when you look at the output you've gotten, take a look at the nibbles I've put in quotes, do they look familiar?
The reason the number is backwards is because of endianness. The 12th bit is where the fractional part is starting in this case, and then it moves backwards.

","You can encode the password for Mpesa in this way:

import java.util.Base64;

public class MpesaUtils {

    public static String getMpesaEncodedPassword(String lipaNaMpesaShortCode,
                              String password, String timeStamp) {

        byte[] bytes = sb.toString().getBytes(StandardCharsets.ISO_8859_1);
        return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(bytes);
    }
}

Usage example:
    String lnmShortCode = ""your lipa na mpesa short code here"";
    String password = ""your password here"";
    String timeStamp = getTimeStamp();

Can you please help me figure out why the both hashes are not identical?
","In your Oracle query, you're generating multiple random byte strings.
Try this to demonstrate: 
select RAND, RAND, RAND, DBMS_CRYPTO.HASH(RAND, 6 /*SHA512*/) as sha512 from 
    (select DBMS_CRYPTO.RANDOMBYTES(5) as RAND from DUAL);

Note the three different values for RAND. So the hash you are generating is actually for a different byte sequence than you think it is.
To fix it, you can use this bit of trickery courtesy of AskTom
select RAND,DBMS_CRYPTO.HASH(RAND, 6 /*SHA512*/) as sha512 from 
    (select rownum, DBMS_CRYPTO.RANDOMBYTES(5) as RAND from DUAL);

including rownum in the subquery makes RAND consistent each time you use it as a field in the top level SELECT.

let message =string(nonce)+ client_id + api_key
let signature = HMACSHA256.Create(API_secret+message)

Simple issue is I cannot find what represents the hexdigest() function in F#.
Also, do I combine the API_Secret with the message as I have done or must they be separated?
","I think you need somethink like this:
let hexdigest (bytes : byte[]) =
   let sb = System.Text.StringBuilder()
   bytes |> Array.iter (fun b -> b.ToString(""X2"") |> sb.Append |> ignore)
   string sb

let signature =
   use hmac = new HMACSHA256.Create(API_secret)
   hmac.ComputeHash(message)
   |> hexdigest

The part with the StringBuilder is what hexdigest does in python (if I get hexdigest right)

I think the handler-level function will look like: 
fileMove fInfo (basePath <> generateSha fInfo)

This question is centered around how to write generateSha :: FileInfo -> String.
I see a few functions that are likely to be helpful:
fileSource :: MonadResource m => FileInfo -> Source m ByteString
sha256Incremental :: Decoder SHA256State
completeSha256Incremental :: Decoder SHA256State -> Int -> Digest SHA256State
showDigest :: Digest t-> String

But I'm unsure of a few things:

How to wire this up in the conduit. Ideally I'd have it stream the file.
Use the SHA interface to incrementally build up the hash. I can get the SHA256 of an empty string easily enough, but I'm not sure how to  add values.  Presumably it's something hidden in the Decoder type?
What the Int argument of completeSha256Incremental is.

Can somebody point me in the right direction?
","This is only a partial answer.  I am stuck in cabal hell right now and can't install sha-streams to see if things work right.
Calculating a SHA256 incrementally is done like this:
sha256FromChunks :: [ByteString] -> Digest SHA256State
sha256FromChunks cs = completeSHA256Incremental $
                          foldl pushChunk sha256Incremental cs

pushChunk is from Data.Binary.Get.  That shows you how all the function calls fit together, but isn't very practical for a streaming scenario.
To use this with conduit, you would need to turn it into a Sink.

Am I doing my endianness conversion correctly or in the correct spot?

Endianness conversion endian_reverse(() is incorrect when unsigned is not 32-bit.
Endianness conversion not used in correct spot.  Endian conversion not needed.
Other issues exists.

Code is assuming unsigned long int is 32-bit.  When unsigned long int is 64-bit, I can get the same answer as OP.
Save yourself time: There is no reason to use loose types here.  Use uint32_t, uint8_t.  For array sizing and string lengths use size_t.  Avoid signed types and constants.

By changing unsigned long --> uint32_t and dropping h0 = endian_reverse(h0); ... h7 = endian_reverse(h7); I came up with
Hash: a9993e36 4706816a ba3e2571 7850c26c 9cd0d89d


Other suggestions.
Multiple of 64
size in str = malloc(size) should be a multiple of 64
Stay within multiples of 64
str[current_length+i]='\0'; can write outside allocation.
Alternate size storing
Works for all size_t values up to 264-3 - 1.
  size_t current_length = ...

  // append length in bits
  uint64_t current_length_bits = current_length;
  current_length_bits *= 8;
  for (i = 8; i > 0; ) {
    i--;
    str[current_length + i] = (unsigned char) current_length_bits;
    current_length_bits >>= 8;
  }
  current_length += 8;

So I want to do this (SHA(N + 1) % 100) on the first time and (SHA(N + 2) % 100) the second time and so on ..
Is it guaranteed to work ? or am i missing out something?
Simply put:
Take any two arbitrary numbers x1, x2 from [0, 99].
Count all numbers from [0, 5000000] which gets mapped to x1 the first time and x2 the second time. Is this count going to be the same (more or less) for any choice of x1,x2?
","I cranked out the results for 5 million values of n, SHA1(N+1)%100, and SHA1(N+2)%100, then ran it through a stats package.  The sets of SHA results were uniformly distributed between 0 and 99, and the correlation matrix was:

sha+2  -0.0016  -0.0001   1.0000

In other words, the SHA outcomes are effectively uncorrelated with each other.  A given number 0-99 from the first SHA calculation is equally likely to be paired with any of 0-99 as the second SHA result across the set.

","Defined in pkcs7.h, the md_algs attribute that you are inspecting is a stack of X509_ALGOR instances:
typedef struct pkcs7_signed_st {
    ASN1_INTEGER *version;      /* version 1 */
    STACK_OF(X509_ALGOR) *md_algs; /* md used */
    STACK_OF(X509) *cert;       /* [ 0 ] */
    STACK_OF(X509_CRL) *crl;    /* [ 1 ] */
    STACK_OF(PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO) *signer_info;
    struct pkcs7_st *contents;
} PKCS7_SIGNED;

It can be safely accessed via the OpenSSL Stack API, for example using the function sk_X509_ALGOR_value() to inspect its element(s).
X509_ALGOR itself is defined in x509.h:
struct X509_algor_st {
    ASN1_OBJECT *algorithm;
    ASN1_TYPE *parameter;
} /* X509_ALGOR */ ;

The information you are looking for is stored in the property algorithm, which you can inspect using, for example, OBJ_obj2txt().
Tying it together, to get a textual representation of the first algorithm in the stack, you could do something like this:
char tbuf[20];
X509_ALGOR *algor = sk_X509_ALGOR_value(Pkcs7->d.sign->md_algs, 0);
int res = OBJ_obj2txt(tbuf, sizeof tbuf, algor->algorithm, 0);

After that, tbuf should contain a value like ""sha1"" and res contains the length of that string. For programmatic purposes, a function like OBJ_obj2nid() is probably more useful.

The debugger did not give you this information because the data field in the stack element is not strongly typed. You would have to cast it yourself to indicate that it is an array of pointers to X509_ALGOR structs. The OpenSSL Stack API provides you a set of macros that do the casting for you and access the array that way. And then, the ASN1_OBJECT that you end up with is hard to inspect or interpret in the debugger since it is just a bunch of bytes representing an object id in ASN.1 format.

","There is an alternative to using RNGCryptoServiceProvider

"56405195","""Signature not valid"" when getting API data (VBA-Excel)","I have an issue when I try to retrieve some data in excel through VBA code.
I used the following as basis: https://github.com/BitMEX/api-connectors/tree/master/official-http/vba
and it works, I was able to update it according to my need and place an order (testnet) 
I now try to retrieve the book but I always get ""Signature not valid"" as response.
Can you please help understand what's I am doing wrong?
The data I want to receive is the following:
https://testnet.bitmex.com/api/explorer/#!/OrderBook/OrderBook_getL2
As Hash function, I use the HexHash function available in the link provided above (and it works for the 'Post' instruction but can't make it works for the ""GET"" instruction.
Thanks in advance
Bellow a working code (POST function):

Dim verb, apiKey, apiSecret, signature, symbol, price, qty, url, postdata, replytext, nonceStr As String

' Set monotonically (w time) increasing nonce

In the second section, I always get an error message in return ""Signature not valid""
","Switching between GET and POST requires more than just changing the verb in the request. A GET request needs to have the data as part of the URL string so try:
url = url & ""?"" & getdata
getdata = """"
httpObject.Open ""GET"", ""https://testnet.bitmex.com"" & url, False

You also need to change this line from:
httpObject.Send (getdata)

to:
httpObject.Send

The way in which you construct the api-signature value is also different for GET requests to this API - see here for details. The changes I have suggested should lead to the correct signature being generated. If you need to URL encode data in VBA then this answer might help.
Other issues:

Dim a, b As String is equivalent to Dim a As Variant, b As String. To declare multiple String variables you need to write Dim a As String, b As String
CreateObject(""MSXML2.XMLHTTP"") accesses the older version 3.0 of MSXML2. To access the most recent version 6.0, you need CreateObject(""MSXML2.XMLHTTP.6.0"")

","MD5 has known vulnerabilities at this point, but that may not be a problem for your application. It's still reasonably good for distinguishing piles of bits. If something comes up with no match, then you know you haven't already seen it, since the algorithm is deterministic. If something comes back as a match, you should actually compare it to the blob that it ostensibly matched before acting as if it's really a duplicate. MD5 is relatively fast, but if you can't afford full-text comparisons on hash collisions, you should probably use a stronger hash, like SHA-256.

","We use MD5 at my work for exactly what you're considering.  Works great.  We only need to detect duplicates uploads on a per-customer basis, which reduces our exposure to the birthday problem, but md5 would still be sufficient for us if we had to detect duplicates across all uploads rather than per customer.  If you can believe the internet, the probability p of a collision given n samples and a hash size of b is bounded by:
p <= n (n - 1) / (2 * 2 ^ b)

A few years back I ran this calculation for n = 10^9 and b = 128 and came up with p <= 1.469E-21.  To put that in perspective, 10^9 files is one per second for 32 years.  So we don't compare files in the event of a collision.  If md5 says the uploads were the same, they're the same.

I have found many possible solutions for that online, however all of them require including some module or framework. 
Isn't HMAC and SHA512 not supported by swift 3.1 natively? 
Sorry if it's a stupid question, I'm relatively new to swift. 
If it's available, how can I simply encrypt some data using hmac sha512? 
Thanks.
","CommonCrypto is the native way to do encryption on Apple devices. You do not need any module or framework, you just add a bridging header and import CommonCrypto:
#import <CommonCrypto/CommonCrypto.h>

You then can compute your HMAC with a simple extension (Swift 4):
extension String {

    func hmac(key: String) -> String {
        var digest = [UInt8](repeating: 0, count: Int(CC_SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH))
        CCHmac(CCHmacAlgorithm(kCCHmacAlgSHA256), key, key.count, self, self.count, &digest)
        let data = Data(bytes: digest)
        return data.map { String(format: ""%02hhx"", $0) }.joined()
    }

}

Example:
let result = ""test"".hmac(key: ""test"")

Result:
88cd2108b5347d973cf39cdf9053d7dd42704876d8c9a9bd8e2d168259d3ddf7

If you use Swift on a non-Apple device you indeed need to use an external framework to do encryption.

"23401965","Is there an especially unlikely SHA1 hash?","I've got a Map<SHA1, BinaryBlob>.  Very similar to Git.
I'd like to put a small, finite number of ""special"" entries into this map.  I'd like to be able to change the values of the binary blobs, but still refer to them by the same key.
The right way to do this is to use a Map<Either<SHA1, SpecialKey>, BinaryBlob>.
The hack way to do this (which is the way I'm actually doing this) is to define:
SHA1 specialKeyA = 0x00000 ... 00
SHA1 specialKeyB = 0x00000 ... 01

I understand that SHA1 produces values which are evenly distributed.  But I wonder if maybe there's an asterisk, and if there are a couple corner-case hashes (such as 0x00.. or maybe 0xFF...) which are guaranteed not to happen.
I feel pretty safe with my current design, but I was just curious :)
EDIT: I'm already counting on hash uniqueness, so I feel very safe with the design.  The question is for curiosity's sake: are there a handful of values which SHA1 happens to be incapable of generating.  Census in the comments so far seems to be no...
","To the best of my knowledge SHA1 does not have a known pre-image of 00…00 (and neither 00…01,00…02, or other ""special"" values). Even though it would not violate any of the formal definitions of a secure hash the IVs are designed to avoid such human recognizable patterns.
Still I would probably advise against the use of these values, because others might, too, have come up with the idea to use these special values, see this question about a git commit with all zeros for example. If it is all the same to you I would generate a random 80bit value, for example 83a…c3, and append your counter to it, for example 83a…c300…01, 83a…c300…02,etc.

","You'll need to use an external library such as this one, or else implement the sha1 algorithm yourself.
Note that sha1 is hashing, not encryption, and it's not a hash algorithm designed for storing passwords, so it's easily broken.

openssl.exe dgst -sha256 -sign privateKey.pem -out \data.txt.sig \data.txt

using bouncy castle 1.57 and java, we get bytes array signature from file, which i could verify it in the code. Private, public and certificate are generated from openSSL. 
so to generate certificates : 
read the private key from the pem private key file:
PEMParser pemParser = new PEMParser(new FileReader(PRIVATE_FILE_PATH));
                    PKCS8EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo encryptedPrivateKeyInfo = (PKCS8EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo) pemParser.readObject();
JceOpenSSLPKCS8DecryptorProviderBuilder jce = new JceOpenSSLPKCS8DecryptorProviderBuilder();
jce.setProvider(""BC"");
InputDecryptorProvider decProv = jce.build(password.toCharArray());
PrivateKeyInfo info = encryptedPrivateKeyInfo.decryptPrivateKeyInfo(decProv);
JcaPEMKeyConverter pemKeyConverter = new JcaPEMKeyConverter();
PrivateKey pk = pemKeyConverter.getPrivateKey(info);

and generate the RSA SHA 256 signature and write the result in the signature file:
byte[] data = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(txtFileToSignPath));
Signature sig = Signature.getInstance(""SHA256withRSA"");
sig.initSign(pk);
sig.update(data);
byte[] signature = sig.sign();
FileOutputStream dfis = new FileOutputStream(SignaturefilePath);
dfis.write(bytesToWrite);
dfis.close();

programmatically i could verify signatures generated  from the code above as well as from open SSL: 
Signature verifySignature = Signature.getInstance(""SHA256withRSA""); 
byte[] signatureBytes =  
Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(SignaturefilePath);
verifySignature.initVerify(getPublicKeyFromCertFile(CERT_PEM));
verifySignature.update(data);
verifySignature.verify(signatureBytes);

on the other hand openSSL is getting always ""verification failure"" by verifiying signatures generated from code. 
is OpenSSL able to verify array of bytes signatures directly, or am I missing anything ?
","code above works fine, was verifying the signature against another file. Question maitained for learning purpose.

get '/generate' => {
    my $phrase = passphrase('my_password')->generate({ algorithm => 'SHA-1'});
    return $phrase->rfc2307();
};

The result looks something like this:
{SSHA}+2Dro1/ntPchT93mgvYMKGjdzy+XKXK1agsG3//hKuLNrQAK

and that's what I store in my PostgreSQL database. 
I'm using Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible as my login solution, but I've yet to get it to work with encrypted passwords. I put a test account into my database where username='test' and password='test', and that works fine. But username='test2' and password='{SSHA}+2Dro1/ntPchT93mgvYMKGjdzy+XKXK1agsG3//hKuLNrQAK' doesn't work. The login page just silently fails and reloads. 
I turned on DBI_TRACE and don't seen much difference between the two except that the account with the plain text password returns this:

I'm sure I'm missing something, but the CPAN page doesn't detail how to handle encrypted passwords. It just says it will be easy. I guess I'm reading that as ""encrypted passwords will be handled automagically."" What am I missing?
Config
This is the relevant portion of my config
plugins: 
 Auth::Extensible:
   realms:
      users:
       provider: 'Database'
 Database:
  dsn: 'dbi:Pg:service=test'

App.pm
Below is what I'm doing in the App.pm. You can see that I'm just trying to require a login for the home page. Maybe I need some '/login' code?
package glm::App;

use Dancer2;
use Dancer2::Plugin::Database;
use Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible;
use Dancer2::Plugin::Passphrase;

use Template;

our $VERSION = '0.1';

get '/' => require_login sub {
    my $sth = database->prepare('SELECT name FROM product', { RaiseError => 1 });
    $sth->execute();

    template 'create_list', {
        'products' => $sth->fetchall_hashref('name'),
    };
};

get '/generate'=> sub {
    my $phrase = passphrase('my_password')->generate({ algorithm => 'SHA-1' });
    return $phrase->rfc2307(); # right now I just manually copy and paste this into the database
};

My database follows the suggested schema for users, passwords, and roles.
Maybe the only other relevant bit of information I can think of is that if I use an encryption scheme not recognized by Digest, I get an error from Digest.pm. That would seem to indicate that it's recognizing the hashed password and trying to decrypt it, but for whatever reason it's just not working. Or it's working and redirecting back to the home page... But why doesn't it do that with 'test,test'?
","TL;DR You're using two different methods for hashing, so the generated hashes are incompatible.
Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::Database uses Crypt::SaltedHash:
sub encrypt_password {
    my ($self, $password, $algorithm) = @_;
    $algorithm ||= 'SHA-1';
    my $crypt = Crypt::SaltedHash->new(algorithm => $algorithm);
    $crypt->add($password);
    $crypt->generate;
}

This generates a hash like:
{SSHA}qTEaPf8KRPt6XBQXIlQhlWstgBz64coW

Compare that to what you got from Dancer2::Plugin::Passphrase:
{SSHA}+2Dro1/ntPchT93mgvYMKGjdzy+XKXK1agsG3//hKuLNrQAK

Notice that the lengths are different. Dancer2::Plugin::Passphrase uses a 16-byte salt by default, while Crypt::SaltedHash uses a 4-byte salt.

Although you could tell Dancer2::Plugin::Passphrase to use a 4-byte salt, it's much easier to just use Crypt::SaltedHash everywhere. The Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible documentation explains how to do this:

A simple script called generate-crypted-password to generate RFC2307-style hashed passwords is included, or you can use Crypt::SaltedHash yourself to do so, or use the slappasswd utility if you have it installed.

For example:
$ generate-crypted-password 
Enter plain-text password ?> foo
Result: {SSHA}zdXPS0QqxyKlzXwHxjJ3rsU19Td4ABzW

I'm implementing ch() function whose definition is

(&:indicate and gate, ^:indicate xor gate, ~:is negate)
I implemented like this:
function ch(x,y,z){
 (x&y) ^ (~x&z)
}

but after I implemented it, when I saw some other implementation such ashttp://point-at-infinity.org/jssha256/, the implementation is like this (below)
function SHA256_Ch(x, y, z) {
  return z ^ (x & (y ^ z));
}

what is this conversion?
can I obtain the same result from wikipedia's?
Could you tell me the path ?
---------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for answeing!

ch() stands for choose: x chooses y or z. When x is 0, z is chosen,
  and when x is 1, y is chosen

This is a critical sentence for me.
I wanted to know how the desiner find second form ch function.
but I guess, if I obtain the view of your advise then, that is obvious.
if a designer of sha256 want to use ch function like it, that makes sense.when x is zero, y is 0, and z is left, because x and z is connected with xor gate,and x and y is connected with and gate.when x is one, y is y and z is nothing, because there are two z connected with xor gate;
I should start my guess from the perspective of the one who structured SHA256 algorythm.
Thanks for teaching!!

","If you write out the truth table for x, y, z and the 2 expressions, you will see that they are identical.
In both cases (I've left out the intermediate results for brevity):
x  y  z  (x&y)^(~x&z)  z^(x&(y^z))
0  0  0  0             0
0  0  1  1             1

1  1  1  1             1

ch() stands for choose:  x chooses y or z. When x is 0, z is chosen, and when x is 1, y is chosen
The second form uses 1 less bitwise operation; but I'd guess that any speed improvement would be implementation specific.

c = int('3c6ef372', 16)

f = int('9b05688c', 16)
g = int('1f83d9ab', 16)

Set the two important variables that depend on value t:
W = int('61626380', 16)
K = int('428a2f98', 16)

From the pseudo code on wikipedia:
S1 = hash.ROTR(e, 6) ^ hash.ROTR(e, 11) ^ hash.ROTR(e, 25)
ch = (e & f) ^ ((~e) & g)#((e1) & g)
temp1 = (h + S1 + ch + K + W) % math.pow(2, 32)
S0 = hash.ROTR(a, 2) ^ hash.ROTR(a, 13) ^ hash.ROTR(a, 22)
maj = (a & b) ^ (a & c) ^ (b & c)
temp2 = (S0 + maj) % math.pow(2, 32)
a = int((temp1 + temp2) % math.pow(2, 32))

ROTR function:
@staticmethod
def ROTR(x, n, w=32):
    return (x >> n) | (x << w - n)

Or, split into functions, like specified in FIPS-180 (Prodcuces the same output)
T1 = int((h + hash.SIGMA1(e) + hash.Ch(e, f, g) + hash.K[t] + W) % math.pow(2, 32))
T2 = int((hash.SIGMA0(a) + hash.Maj(a, b, c)) % math.pow(2, 32))
a = int((T1 + T2) % math.pow(2, 32))

Hash class:
@staticmethod
def ROTR(x, n, w=32):
    return (x >> n) | (x << w - n)
def SIGMA0(x):
    return hash.ROTR(x, 2) ^ hash.ROTR(x, 13) ^ hash.ROTR(x, 22)
def SIGMA1(x):

def Ch(x, y, z):
    return (x & y) ^ (~x & z)
def Maj(x, y, z):
    return (x & y) ^ (x & z) ^ (y & z)

I'm using Python 3 btw. Thanks in advance.
","You need to add a lot more masking here to cut down overflowing bits. For example, your ROTR:
def ROTR(x, n, w=32):
    return (x >> n) | (x << w - n)

leaves all the high bits of x intact above the w boundary; you'd want to construct a mask from w and mask off the high bits, e.g.:
def ROTR(x, n, w=32):
    return ((x >> n) | (x << w - n)) & ((1 << w) - 1)

Similar masks are needed anytime you might have overflowed the assumed ""register width"". They can also replace the error-prone use of % math.pow(2, 32) you've got going on, changing:
int((temp1 + temp2) % math.pow(2, 32))

to:
(temp1 + temp2) & ((1 << 32) - 1)

or equivalently:
(temp1 + temp2) % 2 ** 32

This also needs to happen for bitwise negation where the overflow isn't as obvious: Python's ints are infinite precision, and bitwise negation of a non-negative value makes a negative value, effectively adding infinite 1 bits on the left (in the pseudo-two's complement behavior the language specifies). So ~x must become ~x & ((1 << 32) - 1) or the like to force it back to a positive value containing only the low 32 bits.
This has to be done globally (so temp1 and temp2 are actually int, not float values when you compute with them). In general, math.pow is completely useless; you either want to use the ** operator (which doesn't coerce to float and executes more efficiently) or the built-in pow function (which is only needed for its three argument for doing efficient modular exponentiation).

","A beginner could follow these steps :

Check your F5 BIG-IP version, and then read K13163 to know which cipher suites are supported for this version (follow the links if your version is not in this document). This is necessary to know whether your client and your server have a chance to succeed in the handshaking.
Go to K8802 and follow the link Configuring the cipher strength for SSL profiles for your F5 BIG-IP version. This will answer your question, on where it is specified.
If it's still not enough for you to get the right setup, you need to read K15292 to know how to debug your handshaking problem (some SSL knowledge is required).

","The point of salt is to add entropy to the hash.
Cryptographic hashes are designed so that a tiny change to the input makes a huge difference in the resulting hash, so (barring a flaw in the algorithm) it becomes impossible to know whether the original input was the same from checking the similarity between two differently salted hashes.
But if you use the same salt for everyone, you lose much of the benefit that provides.  Two identical passwords hashed with the same salt will give you the same hash. 

If you use the same salt for everyone, then at the very least, someone can figure out that two users have the same password.  
More importantly, it greatly lessens the time someone has to spend to crack passwords, since they can now check the same hash against every user at once.
At worst, someone could already have a lookup table for the salt you use, making it trivial to crack every user's password.  

While it's possible to use a simple salt (like the user's ID) to achieve the goal of making cracking harder, it's only a tiny bit more effort to use a random string, and makes cracking even harder (since the salt is nearly impossible to predict ahead of time, the chance of having a precomputed lookup table for that salt becomes much lower).

","The reason you're getting different results is because the Ruby code converts 'testing' into UTF-16, and the jsSHA example is using ASCII. If you expand ""testing"" into 16-bit Unicode, you get ""740065007300740069006e006700"" in hexadecimal, which gives the same answer as Ruby.

cat policy.json | openssl sha1 -sign CloudFront_Key.pem |base64 |tr '+=/' '-_~'
I can't figure out how to do that in elixir. I've been looking into this dependency and tried using :sha1 instead in it's sign method. I did read through here and did see sha, not sha1. Is that how erlang calls it? (I have close to no knowledge about erlang). Tried :sha but I do not get the same key as in the terminal and it does not seem to work. I also noticed that base64 usually adds a few extra chars at the end than the terminal. Not sure what to do.. Resort to try using System.cmd ?
This is the AWS doc I'm following: create & verify signed cookies and create signature for signed cookie
","You can use :public_key.sign/3 for this.

","Don't know why you'd do this, but here's a solution for you.
Here's some assumptions.

You were given two date hashes (two inputs)
You know exactly how the date hashes were created (EG: always in the format of YYYY-MM-DD)
You know the range of your target date (So you can reverse the hash back to the original date)

So in psudocode, you'd do something like this.
date getDateFromHash(string inputHash) {
  date startDate = '1911-01-01';
  date endDate = '2017-12-31';
  for(date checkDate = startDate; checkDate < endDate; checkDate + 1 day) {
    if (sha1(checkDate) = inputHash) { return checkDate }
  }
  return null;
}
date firstDate = getDateFromHash(""0b10f03fb245a6486d6ab5b25a2f050bf87093a5""); // 2017-09-07
date secondDate = getDateFromHash(""34152f3661d73490ac89b0fe15cb3170aac06bb8""); // 2017-09-06
if (firstDate > secondDate) {
    return true;
} else {
    return false;
} // compare using default date operators

But honestly speaking, like the comment says, there's no point of hashing date values. Hence why I'm only dropping a quich psudo code for you just to point you in the right direction, if you seriously want to tread down this path.

"22056397","Is it possible to create Django passwords with Perl?","So an emergency project was dumped on me to merge a MySQL user database into an existing Django user database.
I've figured just about everything out except how to handle the passwords as they use different hashes. I don't know Python, the Django backend, or very much about hashing techniques. 
I do have a way to verify users with their emails, I just need a way to take the passwords they give me and save them into the database in a Django-acceptable way.  It will be have to be done in Perl since that's the only language I know on the server.
I found this page talking about how Django handles passwords, but I sadly don't understand most of what they're saying.  Also, I don't know if it's any help, but the admin area of the Django site gives the ""hint"" of  

""Use '[algo]$[salt]$[hexdigest]'"" for the password.

That doesn't mean much to me either, but maybe it does to one of you?
","There are basically two ways to handle this: convert existing passwords to a format acceptable by Django, or write your own Django password hasher.
For the first way, as you found, the password field consists of three parts, each separated by a $. (Django 1.6 passwords may have 4 parts, but let's ignore that extra part for now, since Django 1.6 also supports the more traditional 3-part passwords.) The parts are

algorithm, which describes the password hashing algorithm; it will look like md5, pbkdf2, etc.
salt, the salt for the hash algorithm
hexdigest, the hashed password

So, assuming your passwords are already salted and hashed, your script needs to take the hashed/salted passwords in your existing database, separate the salt from the hash, then store them into the database with the appropriate algorithm string prefixed. There should be Perl modules for doing password hashing using various algorithms. Django's recommended algorithm is PBKDF2. bcrypt is also good. Any hash algorithm is fine, though, as far as Django is concerned, as long as it has a built-in hasher for that algorithm (Django has hashers for the most common hashing algorithms).
If your existing passwords are not salted and hashed…well, now would be a good time to do that. ;-)

The alternative way is to just copy the passwords over to the new database as-is, and write your own password hasher to handle them in your Django app. Of course, that would require writing some Python code.

","This is according to my knowledge
Sha1
Some collision attacks against Sha1 exist but are not currently practical as the CPU power required is estimated as costing almost $3 million for each hash.
Even if Sha1 can be considered acceptable for most uses, Sha2 is all-around a better alternative: it is just as fast, more secure, and the only potential downside is the larger space required for storing the hash. If for some reason this is a concern (we’re talking about 32 bytes instead of 20) truncating Sha2′s output is still more secure than using Sha1.
The only reason Sha1 should be chosen is for interoperability reasons.
Sha2
Sha2 is the successor of Sha1 and has 4 different variants, each with a different digest size (output size):

Sha-256 should be chosen in most cases where a high speed hash
  function is desired. It is considered secure with no known theoretical
  vulnerabilities and it has a reasonable digest size of 32 bytes. For
  things like hashing user password, though, a function designed to be
  slow is preferred: a great one is bcrypt.
Sha-224 uses the same algorithm as Sha-256 (except for the initial
  seed values) simply truncating its output. It was created because its
  digest size has the same length as two-key Triple DES keys which can
  be handy.
Sha-512 is different, using 64 bit numbers and having 80 rounds
  (versus 32 bit numbers and 64 rounds of Sha-256). Its digest size – 64
  bytes – is very large and it is probably overkill for most uses.
Sha-384 is the same as Sha-512 (again, except for the initial seed
  values) but truncated to reduce its digest size.

RUN git clone <url>

we need the git pull to always run. But if package.json doesn't change, we don't need to re-install. 
I have two questions - how can we get the git pull to always run? I believe we can cache bust using a --build-arg
However, if git pull always runs, then according to docker, so will the npm install command.
One thing we could do is use some custom logic to compare the sha-sum of the package.json files.
RUN git clone <url>
RUN git pull
ENV package_shasum $(sha1sum package.json)
RUN compare-shasums && npm install

does anybody know how to do this with Docker?
The reason why we are doing the git stuff in Docker instead of outside the container and copying files into the container is for making Jenkins easier to work with.
","Normally if we COPY code from the host to image, we can use this trick to cache dependencies:
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .

and that will only run npm install if the package.json file has changed.
But if we do the git pull in the Dockerfile, then it's a bit different, but we can do this:
RUN git clone git@github.com:ORESoftware/live-mutex.git
ADD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ORESoftware/live-mutex/master/package.json package.json

","SHA calculation
The SHA is a result of the parent object(s) hashes, the tree hash, the name and email of the author, the timestamp, the commit message text, and the files involved in the commit. (And the GPG signature, if one is present.)
That is why if you change the commit message, or rebase a commit, you end up with a new SHA.
The rest of the files in the repository are not directly involved in that SHA, but the SHA of the parent(s) of the commit are part of the calculation, so they are indirectly involved.
You can see the metadata involved by using cat-file. Take a commit ID and do this:
$ git cat-file -p 3d911c37dc7cc6d50af9cbc66aa36084158308f5
tree 487660899e53bef8b15d3e1692172f689ed965c5

author Dan Lowe <dan@xxxxxx.com> 1483760015 -0500
committer Dan Lowe <dan@xxxxxx.com> 1483760015 -0500

Update line number settings in vim for 7.4+

Here we see the tree object, one parent, author & committer, and the commit message text. Not shown are the file objects attached, but they are there. In some cases a second parent is also present (e.g. a merge commit).
Git clients and servers
All git repositories are full repositories (except shallow clones). So if you make a new repository on your laptop, it is a full repository. You can add, remove, commit, rebase, all of those operations are completely local. The entire repository history is on your laptop. That is one reason git is so good at working offline.
However, most people that is not enough. They need to share code with other developers, or publish it for public consumption. This is the purpose of services like Github, Bitbucket, etc.
Those services are just another copy of the full repository, and you are synchronizing with it.
Here's something you can try. I'll use command line git instead of SourceTree.
## Make two repositories
mkdir a && cd a && git init
cd ..
mkdir b && cd b && git init --bare

## Add some content to 'a'
cd ../a
touch a.txt && git add . && git commit -m ""New content""

## Set the other repository as your remote
git remote add origin ../b

## Let's push!
git push -u origin master

## Take a look at 'b' now...
cd ../b
git log

... and your commit from a is there. You just made a git server! Although not the most useful one really, because it's just on your disk. But if you put some SSH or https server in the middle... now you have Github, just without the fancy web interface part.

#include ""sha1.h""

module SecurityC{

    uses interface Boot;
    uses interface SHA1;
}

implementation{

    uint8_t Message_Digest[SHA1HashSize];
    SHA1Context context;
    uint8_t num=123;
    uint32_t length=3;
    uint8_t i;

    event void Boot.booted()
    {
        dbg(""Boot"", ""Application booted.\n"");

        call SHA1.reset(&context);
        while(length>0)
        {
            length=length/10;
            call SHA1.update(&context, &num, length);
        }
            call SHA1.digest(&context, Message_Digest);
            for(i = 0; i < SHA1HashSize; i++) {
                dbg(""Boot"", ""%s KEY IS: %x \n"", sim_time_string(), Message_Digest[i]);
        }
    }
}

","First of all, your code is bad. It lacks two braces and the function SHA1.context doesn't exist in this library (it should be SHA1.reset, I think). Moreover, Message_Digest and context aren't declared. Please provide the full code you actually use.
However, I see you have at least two serious bugs.
Firstly, you pass the value of x to SHA1.update, but you should pass a pointer to the message. Therefore, the function processes a message that lies at the address 123 in the memory (you should get a compiler warning about this). If you want to calculate a hash from the value of x, try this:
call SHA1.update(context, &x, sizeof(x));

Secondly, Message_Digest seems to be a uint8_t array of size SHA1HashSize. In the last statement you print a pointer to this array instead of its content (and again, the compiler should warn you), so you get an adress of this array in the memory. You may want to process the array in a loop:
uint8_t i;
for(i = 0; i < SHA1HashSize; ++i) {
    // process Message_Digest[i], for instance print it
}

Okay.

","It's defined in such a way that you only need to deal with bytes if the message is an even number of bytes.

","Using the account ID as a salt is probably not a good idea - if someone can steal your hashed passwords, then they can probably get the account ID's too.  Having a more convoluted hash in code in this instance is therefore probably more secure, provided that the code is also well protected.  Using a known random string as the salt in the code means that someone would have to hack both your data and your code in order to attack passwords - that has to be better than just having to attack the database alone.

","In Java there are no unsigned types so you cannot avoid negative values in binary data. It's not the problem.
One problem you have is in byteArrayToString(). toHexString() does not left-pad with zeros so values 0..15 don't output two chars but just one. I'd use something like String.format(""%02x"", b) instead. See also: How to convert a byte array to a hex string in Java?

Almost.
What you can do is create your own inline assembler functions.  See man inline:

inline(4)
Name
inline, filename.il - Assembly language inline template files
Description
Assembly language call instructions are replaced by a copy of their
  corresponding function body obtained from the inline template (*.il)
  file.
Inline template files have a suffix of .il, for example:
% CC foo.il hello.c

Inlining is done by the compiler's code generator.
...
Examples
Please review libm.il or vis.il for examples. You can find a version of these libraries that is specific to each supported architecture under the compiler's lib/ directory.
...

An example can be found here (emphasis mine):

Performance Tuning With Sun Studio Compilers and Inline Assembly Code
...
This paper provides a demonstration of how to measure the performance
  of a critical piece of code. An example using a compiler flag and
  another example using inline assembly code are provided. The results are compared to show the benefits and differences of each
  approach.
...

It's not hard at all. I had to write a lot of SPARC inline assembler functions for a customer I was consulting for back in the Solaris 8 days, some of them were pretty basic - effectively one-liners to wrap a single instruction.  I swear some of them wound up in later versions of the Studio compiler suite (since we were sub-contracted by Sun itself, that's not surprising, nevermind the fact that some of them were blatantly obvious - floor() and ceil(), IIRC, were two of them - and should have been there in the first place...)

","There is no sha224 package, the SHA224 algorithm is implemented in the crypto/sha256 package (along with SHA256 of course). This is because SHA224 is simply a truncated version of SHA256.
You properly imported that, use the sha256.New224() function to acquire a new SHA224 ""hasher"" (hash.Hash):
func GetSha224Hash(text string) string {
    hasher := sha256.New224()
    hasher.Write([]byte(text))
    return hex.EncodeToString(hasher.Sum(nil))
}

Note: if you just want to hash some data, you don't need to create a hasher. Most packages provide a shortcut to do that, e.g. sha256.Sum224():
func GetSha224Hash(text string) string {
    s := sha256.Sum224([]byte(text))
    return hex.EncodeToString(s[:])
}

Or here's a one-liner:
func GetSha224Hash(text string) string {
    return fmt.Sprintf(""%x"", sha256.Sum224([]byte(text)))
}

My current thinking is to put the password through a generator like - md5hashgenerator.com I would make sure its SHA1.

","UPDATE:
This link is quite helpful in understanding use cases for hash algorithms & encryption algorithms. Fundamental difference between Hashing and Encryption algorithms
""Use a hash function when you want to compare a value but can't store the plain representation (for any number of reasons). Passwords should fit this use-case very well since you don't want to store them plain-text for security reasons (and shouldn't)""
""Use encryption whenever you need to get the input data back out. Notice the word need. If you're storing credit card numbers, you need to get them back out at some point, but don't want to store them plain text. So instead, store the encrypted version and keep the key as safe as possible.""
As the comments mention, md5 and sha1 type hashes are no longer secure. Use php's built-in password hashing functions. You can read up about them here http://php.net/manual/en/book.password.php
particularly password_hash() & password_verify()
An example usage for password_verify:
// grab hashed pass from db - to compare against - then perform password_verify() method
if (password_verify($inputPassword, $dbPass)) {
            // success
}

where $inputPassword is the plain text password entered into the login form.
and an example usage of password_hash()
$hash = password_hash($inputPassword, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);

This is only feasible if value1 is easy enough to guess. GPUs are faster at this than CPUs, so you'd probably use a bunch of ATI CPUs to attack this.
Not having a cheap way to compute an input matching a given output is an essential property of a secure hash function, which is called first pre-image resistance. For SHA-512 we know no way faster than brute-force to do this.

The first naive approach to realize it in Helm:
{{- $passw := ""testpassw"" -}}
{{- $salt := ""testsalt"" -}}
{{- $hasharg := printf ""%s%s"" $salt $passw -}}
{{- $encSalt := $salt | b64enc -}}

{{- $hash2 := $hash1 | sha256sum -}}
{{- $encHash2 := $hash2 | b64enc -}}
{{- printf ""%s %s\n"" $encHash2 $encSalt -}}

This template generates the wrong result because sha256sum returns a result as a string in the hexadecimal encoding and the second sha256sum consumes it, but interprets the argument as ""clear"" string.  I was trying to use printf with formatting with no success.
Is it possible to resolve that issue by Helm to avoid creating a container for generating the hash?

","I'm not sure I've understood your question but here are some answers:
When you use a SHA-1 hash function, it converts some value you gave it in input, into another value. Whereas your input value can be as long as you want, the digest result will be fixed (your 160-bits result). 
As I understand your question, you want to give some ""type"" to what you set in input and what you get in output. I think that's the point you misunderstand: whatever data you set in input, they are juste bits (or bytes if you prefer to group them). What you get in output are also bits (or bytes). Then, it is your choice to represent them as you prefer: as an hexadecimal value, or as several hexadecimal values put into an array. It's up to you ;)
In your code example, according to the documentation :
import java.security.MessageDigest; 
public class MessageDigestExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{

    String input = ""This is a message"";
    MessageDigest hash = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA1"");

    //Here ""input"" is a String
    System.out.println(""input : "" + input);
    //Here you convert your ""input"" String into a byte array
    hash.update(Utils.toByteArray(input));
    //Here you get the ""hash.digest()"" result, which is an byte array, then you convert it into some hexadecimal value
    //(just check the library documentation where ""Utils.toHex()"" function comes from to know what it returns exactly).
    //Finally you cast it into a String value as you print it.

I am having trouble with the following step:

Treat the output as little endian and extract the last-significant 16 bits. (These are the first two bytes of the output, with the second byte being the most significant one.)

Here's what I have so far:
double get_CbCr_angle(const char* identifier) {

    unsigned char temp[SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH];
    char buf[SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH*2];

    // initalise with 0s
    memset(buf, 0x0, SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH*2);
    memset(temp, 0x0, SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH);

    // compute hash into temp
    SHA1((unsigned char *)identifier, strlen(identifier), temp);

    // print from temp into buf and
    // interpret as (signed) chars
    int i = 0;
    for (i=0; i < SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH; i++) {
        sprintf( (char*) &(buf[i*2]), ""%02x"", temp[i]);
    }

    printf(""SHA1 is %s\n"", buf);

    // make a union type of char and float so we can read a char array
    // as float.
    union charFloat {
        float f;
        char s[sizeof(float)];
    };

    union charFloat foo;

    // put first two chars (bytes) into union.
    // bracket notation should be fine since both foo and buf are
    // char arrays.
    foo.s[0] = buf[1];
    foo.s[1] = buf[0];

    printf(""interpreted as chars: %s\n"", foo.s);
    printf(""interpreted as float: %f\n"", foo.f);  // 0.000000 - why?

}

But I fail to get any reasonable output with this approach. Using more bytes only gives me nonsense values for the float, aswell as when interpreting it as an int.
Obviously I do not expect anyone to solve this for me. I'd just be very thankful for some tips in what direction to look.
Thanks a lot in advance.
","I would do this by assembling an uint16_t from two chars using explicit shifts and ORs:
uint16_t x = (((uint16_t)(uint8_t)temp[1]) << 8) |
             (((uint18_t)(uint8_t)temp[0]) << 0);

The double casts are necessary to ensure that each char value is zero- rather than sign-extended to the width of uint16_t, before the shift.  Note also that I am reading from temp, not buf - the raw SHA hash, not the hex-coded hash.  Using the hex-coded hash would limit the possible values that x could take.
Then, convert x to a floating-point number in the range [0, 1) by dividing it by 65536:
double f = x / 65536.0;

65536 is 216; the value range of uint16_t is 0 through 65535, inclusive. The .0 suffix on the divisor is necessary to make C perform floating-point rather than integer division.  For efficiency, this division can be combined with the next step of multiplying by 2π:
double f = x * (2 * M_PI / 65536);

M_PI (declared in math.h) is already a floating-point number, so we no longer need a .0 suffix on 65536, but you need to put parentheses around the entire subexpression 2 * M_PI / 65536 to force the compiler to evaluate that part at compile-time and emit just one runtime multiplication.

    // compute hash into temp
    SHA1((unsigned char *)identifier, strlen(identifier), temp);

    // print from temp into buf and
    // interpret as (signed) chars
    int i = 0;
    for (i=0; i < SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH; i++) {
        sprintf( (char*) &(buf[i*2]), ""%02x"", temp[i]);
    }

    printf(""SHA1 is %s\n"", buf);

    // make a union type of char and float so we can read a char array
    // as float.
    union charFloat {
        float f;
        char s[sizeof(float)];
    };

    union charFloat foo;

    // put first two chars (bytes) into union.
    // bracket notation should be fine since both foo and buf are
    // char arrays.
    foo.s[0] = buf[1];
    foo.s[1] = buf[0];

    printf(""interpreted as chars: %s\n"", foo.s);
    printf(""interpreted as float: %f\n"", foo.f);  // 0.000000 - why?

}

But I fail to get any reasonable output with this approach. Using more bytes only gives me nonsense values for the float, aswell as when interpreting it as an int.
Obviously I do not expect anyone to solve this for me. I'd just be very thankful for some tips in what direction to look.
Thanks a lot in advance.
","Let's take a closer look at that algorithm:


Run the input through SHA-1 (RFC 3174 [4]).
Treat the output as little endian and extract the last-significant 16 bits. (These are the first two bytes of the output, with the second
  byte being the most significant one.)
Divide the value by 65536 (use float division) and multiply it by 2π (two Pi).


The algorithm isn't saying to treat the first two bytes as a floating point value.  It says to treat them as a 16-bit integer, then convert the value to a floating point type for the next step.
Also, you should be using temp instead of buf when converting the values, as buf contains printable characters representing hash output while temp contains the actual output.
So you would convert the value like this:
uint16_t value;
value = temp[0];
value |= temp[1] << 8;

Then you cast it to double for the next step:
double result = value * 2 * M_PI / 65536;

What exactly are you decoding and encoding?

","header_hex is a regular string of lower case ASCII characters and the decode() method with 'hex' argument changes it to a (binary) string (or bytes object in Python 3) with bytes 0x93 0xa0 etc. In C it would be an array of unsigned char of length 64 in this case.
This array/byte string of length 64 is then hashed with SHA256 and its result (another binary string of size 32) is again hashed. So hash is a string of length 32, or a bytes object of that length in Python 3. Then encode('hex_codec') is a synomym for encode('hex') (in Python 2); in Python 3, it replaces it (so maybe this code is meant to work in both versions). It outputs an ASCII (lower hex) string again that replaces each raw byte (which is just a small integer) with a two character string that is its hexadecimal representation. So the final bit reverses the double hash and outputs it as hexadecimal, to a form which I usually call ""lowercase hex ASCII"".

    // this function will leave tempBuffer with the data to be signed
    public void pkcs1_sha(byte[] toSign, short bOffset, short bLength,byte[] out)
    {
        md.reset();
        hashLen = md.doFinal(toSign, bOffset, bLength, out, (short) 0);
    }

}

the problem is, when I execute sign, verify and get hash commands, I desire to get same answers from verify and get hash. for some data the card answers correctly:

I will be so thankful if anyone can give me a hint or has had the same experience!!!
","Your hash is placed at the most significant end of the value, as RSA uses big endian encoding. This means that the value may be returned mod N (the modulus), which will result in a different value than that you put in.
Place the hash at the least significant end of the message and your code should run.

Notes:

RSA without padding is not secure;
Signature generation is not the same as encrypting a hash value with a private key if you consider padding, side channel attacks, performance etc. etc. etc..

I'm reading the Botan documentation and found an example somewhat similar to what I need but I'm having difficulties adapting it.
I need to encrypt the XML in SHA1+RSA using the certificates and encode the result in Base64.
The official documentation provide examples in many languages unfortunately C++ is not one of them, I use the php example as start point to create my PoC code in C++.
The exact problem is this.
I have this XML example:

I need to encrypt the XML in SHA1+RSA using the certificates and encode the result in Base64. Any help will be very appreciated.
","I'm a little bit confused about your main question. Guess you have to mention it more obvious. But as I noticed the problem is how to encrypt using your public RSA key and SHA-1 hash function! (Am I right?)
So in that case I would say the EME1(SHA-256) that you could see in encryptor/decryptor objects aren't the bulk encryption algorithm and hash function used for encryption. They are padding algorithms!
In Botan there are tls_channel and tls_callbacks which handle the whole process of encryption and decryption between two sides. Take a further look at them.
Also if Botan is not mandatory I suggest you to use Openssl in evp.h file the function EVP_SealInit will may help you by letting pick your desired algorithm with const EVP_CIPHER *type input. For more info check this link

It appears that the Sha for the HASH is identical but the second Sha (digest) gives a differing result in the NodeJs version. Any pointers to where I'm going wrong? 
For reference I'm using sha library in python and crypto in NodeJs
","One problem is that you're implicitly converting the HASH Buffer to a UTF-8 string which is liable to cause corrupt output when converting binary to UTF-8. Instead, you can call .update() multiple times and preserve the binary data in HASH:
digestHash.update(nonce + createdDate);
digestHash.update(HASH);
var digest = digestHash.digest();

On an unrelated note, you don't need base64_encode_string() for Buffers, as for those you can simply do buffer.toString('base64') (e.g. HASH.toString('base64')).

","You should simply just have to change the name of the prototype in the header file, then change the name of the definition of the implementation in the cpp file, and finally remember to change the name where you are using it. 
.h:
size_t print(const char* str); to size_t Msg(const char * str)

.cpp:
size_t Sha256Class::print(const char *str){
    return write_L(str);
}

to

size_t Sha256Class::Msg(const char *str){
    return write_L(str);
}

arduino file:
uint8_t* hash;
uint32_t a;
unsigned long ms;
Serial.println(""Test: RFC4231 4.2"");
Serial.println(""Expect:b0344c61d8db38535ca8afceaf0bf12b881dc200c9833da726e9376c2e32cff7"");
Serial.print(""Result:"");
ms = micros();
Sha256.initHmac(hmacKey1,20);
/* change from Sha256.print(""Hi There"") to */
Sha256.Msg(""Hi There"");
printHash(Sha256.resultHmac());
Serial.print("" Hash took : "");
Serial.print((micros() - ms));
Serial.println("" micros"");
Serial.println();

However, since you have a #if  defined(SHA256_LINUX) around the prototype in the header file it could possibly not be declared as Msg(const char *str) instead of print(const char *str) so the best solution would just be to leave the print function implemented and create a second method that does the same thing.
In response to the comment.
.h:
// Add this somewhere in the code wherever you see fit
size_t Msg(const char * str);

.cpp:
//Add this somewhere in the cide wherever you see fit
size_t Sha256Class::Msg(const char *str){
    return write_L(str);
}

And in the arduino file just call the function as you wanted it to be with the new name Sha256.Msg(""Hi There"");

Telling me in my java programm I will have to decrypt this password in order to be able to use it.
Is it me or does he have it confused with crypto hash algorithm?
Can I actually get it decrypted?
","""Encrypted"" is a misleading term, because that implies that it can be decrypted.  Something transformed with the ""SHA256"" algorithm is actually cryptographically hashed.  There is no ""decrypt"" functionality for a cryptographic hashing algorithm.
But you can still use it.  When a user submits a password, perform ""SHA256"" on the user's submitted password, and compare it with the stored, hashed password.  By the looks of the string above, you may need to convert the hash output to a hex string to compare it.
Additionally, you may first need to find out if a salt is applied to the hash (additional random content added on a per-user basis to increase security).  If so, then you'll need to apply the salt to the user's submitted password before hashing it.

"32319466","authorize.net production certificate upgrades","I have a website that integrates with authorize.net and received a notice that they are upgrading their certificates so that they are signed using Security Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA-2). Specifically, that their API services will use EnTrust’s SHA-256, 2048-bit certificate. 
It goes on: ""Please contact your solution provider and web hosting company to ensure your solution has these certificates installed and is capable of using them to secure your connection to Authorize.Net. ""
When users connect to the payment pages on my site, they are on a secure connection (DigiCert SHA-256 certificate), but I'm not sure if that means that my site's connection to api.authorize.net is similarly secured. 
Sorry for asking what is probably a very dumb question, but how can I find out if this change will require any re-coding on my end, and how can I check that my site's certificate is going to work? 
Thanks so much for your help!
","I also got the notice from authorize.net, but fortunately for me our hosting site's admins took care of it.  I got a similar notice from PayPal, which is also upgrading their certificates for SHA-256 compliance. In researching that one I came across this related Stack Overflow question: How can I tell if my paypal certificate is SHA-256? - PayPal service upgrades. 
One answer links to this github gist which uses openssl and awk to check the installed certs. If you run it and see the certs that authorize.net has upgraded too listed, that should tell you your server will work.  This is a assuming you're on a Linux server.

"41468604","git rebase and SHAs mentioned in log messages","Sometimes the log message for a git commit will mention the SHA of other commits.  This happens in the suggested log message for git revert and you also may add it by hand ('fixed bug introduced in abcd0123').
When rebasing, the SHAs of commits change.  Is there a way I can automatically fix up the log messages to have the new SHAs?  In general, this might not be possible in 100% of cases (a commit might disappear altogether, be squashed, etc).  But 90% of the time a simple rebase leaves a one-to-one correspondence between the original and the rebased commits, so it should be possible to remap the SHAs in log messages.
I have tried git rebase --verbose, which I hoped would print something like
Applying: My log message here.
  old commit was 01234
  new commit is abcde

I could then use that to manually fiddle the log messages (with a further rebase... which would in turn change the SHAs... so it would be awkward, but nonetheless possible).  But as far as I can tell --verbose doesn't print more information than the normal mode.
Is there some magic tool which will rebase and rewrite the log messages for me?  In the absence of ponies, can I convince git rebase to print more information about old and new SHAs so I can do the job myself?

You can use git patch-id to find commits that apply the same changes, the most brute-force method would be
git rev-list --no-merges --reflog --all \
| git diff-tree --stdin -p \
| git patch-id | sort > patch-ids

awk '{print $2,$1}' patch-ids | uniq -Df1

to find every set of commits in your repo that apply similar patches.  A bit of git log --grep= applied to the results, and perhaps some restraint on your rev-list args, should get you where you want to go.
On GNU/anything replacing the uniq with
uniq -f1 --all-repeated=separate | awk '{print $1}' | awk '{$1=$1; print}' RS=

groups the commit ids for you.  You could use join or some more awking to achieve the same effect elsewhere.
You can add git notes to a commit (or to any object), that might help if you're trying to distribute warnings about what happened.

I want to ensure that users don't manipulate the original PDF, so it's secured. I also want to be able to identify any forgery, so when the document is generated I store it's sha1 signature on database.
I create this signature from the FileStreamResult returned from the method that creates de PDF file. This FileStreamResult is just later returned to the browser, where the PDF file is shown.
My problem is that, after saving the PDF file to disk the sha1 signature of this file is different from the one on the database.
Also... if I generate exactly the same document in Firefox and in Chrome, when I save them to disk both have different signatures.
Keep in mind that I'm creating once and again the document, with the same process, same data and same filename (once I check the signature I write it down and delete the file to try with the other browser). 
I suspect that browsers' PDF plugins are adding some type of comment inside the stream, invisible to the user, that makes each file different from the other (and from the original FileStreamResult whose signature I stored on DB).
I wonder if anyone know other causes than could be causing this result and if there is any way to get the correct signature on my database.

","This implementation does only do the encryption of AES. It assumes you will implement the key schedule yourself.
Executing the key schedule will give you 11 keys of 16 bytes each. In this implementation this is represented as an array of [44 x 4] numbers from 0 to 256. You should pass this array to the cipher function.

Note: When you are implementing this yourself, it is a good idea to familiarize yourself with the AES block cipher first. Understand what the cipher function does before implementing parts, because otherwise you will surely get stuck.

The vperm v0,v0,v0,v17 seem like dead instructions because v0 is not used after the permutation.
What does vperm v0,v0,v0,v17 do?

The C++ source code is available at sha256-p8.cxx.
The source file was compiled with g++ -g3 -O3 -Wall -DTEST_MAIN -mcpu=power8 sha256-2-p8.cxx -o sha256-2-p8.exe.
The complete disassembly s available at PPC64 SHA-256 disassembly.

I think the fragment above is being produced by SHA256_SCHEDULE. I see the collection of VectorShiftLeft (vsldoi) after the block in question.
To zero in even more I'm fairly certain it is the endian-swapper for the first 16-words:
const uint8x16_p8 mask = {3,2,1,0, 7,6,5,4, 11,10,9,8, 15,14,13,12};
for (unsigned int i=0; i<16; i+=4)
    VectorStore32x4u(VectorPermute32x4(VectorLoad32x4u(data, i*4), mask), W, i*4);

SHA256_SCHEDULE looks like so:
// +2 because Schedule reads beyond the last element
void SHA256_SCHEDULE(uint32_t W[64+2], const uint8_t* data)
{
#if (__LITTLE_ENDIAN__)
    const uint8x16_p8 mask = {3,2,1,0, 7,6,5,4, 11,10,9,8, 15,14,13,12};
    for (unsigned int i=0; i<16; i+=4)
        VectorStore32x4u(VectorPermute32x4(VectorLoad32x4u(data, i*4), mask), W, i*4);
#else
    for (unsigned int i=0; i<16; i+=4)
        VectorStore32x4u(VectorLoad32x4u(data, i*4), W, i*4);
#endif

    // At i=62, W[i-2] reads the 65th and 66th elements. W[] has 2 extra ""don't care"" elements.
    for (unsigned int i = 16; i < 64; i+=2)
    {
        const uint32x4_p8 s0 = Vector_sigma0(VectorLoad32x4u(W, (i-15)*4));
        const uint32x4_p8 w0 = VectorLoad32x4u(W, (i-16)*4);
        const uint32x4_p8 s1 = Vector_sigma1(VectorLoad32x4u(W, (i-2)*4));
        const uint32x4_p8 w1 = VectorLoad32x4u(W, (i-7)*4);

        const uint32x4_p8 r = vec_add(s1, vec_add(w1, vec_add(s0, w0)));
        VectorStore32x4u(r, W, i*4);
    }
}


Here is an image of the section in question with v0 highlighted. 

","At first glance you've done all the heavy lifting, that screenshot looks a lot like its going to be the LE endian swapper section. I'm assuming you're spot on here. I expect that v17 is the mask variable - it's loaded as vs49 from the TOC earlier on.
The key piece of information you're missing is that v0 is vs32 (endlessly confusing I know). I'm not sure where the best place to demonstrate this is but the ABI will do. You can download it here: https://members.openpowerfoundation.org/document/dl/576.

How is that. If there is an implementation of SHA256 in my netbsd openssh, why isn't it available as a mac cipher?
","OpenSSH 5.0 had support for SHA-256 key exchange algorithm, but not for MACs with SHA-256 hashes. For the reference, there is a source code:
https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/V_5_0_P1/myproposal.h
The SHA256 usage in MAC and in Key exchange is totally distinct and one does not affect the other. If SHA256 is used in either of them depends on the availability of this hash in underlying OpenSSL, but also if the OpenSSH implemented such algorithm. 10 years ago (2007), it was implemented only as a key exchange algorithm (the MAC were standardized later).
The original RFC4253 does not list any SHA256 algorithms. The DH key exchange method was standardized in RFC4419 (2006), but the HMACS using SHA2 were standardized as late as in 2012 in RFC6668.
Your version is between them, where there was no standard for this so it was not implemented.

The application will necessarily include compiled code to hash, encrypt and decrypt the data.
Assuming we are using rigorous algorithms like salted and stretched AES-256 and SHA-256, is the fact that the user has the application in compiled form (and with some effort could presumably work out the algorithms being used) make it any easier for them to crack the encryption, or generate a fake hash?

Essentially, your product becomes more vulnerable when an attacker has its source, because the attacker can more easily spot your coding mistakes. However, it's coding mistakes that make your application crackable, not the fact that an attacker has your source code.

So far, we have been storing the passwords using AES encryption and a salted version of the user's password(for our site) as the cipher.  When a user requests something from the api, they must input their password.  The password checked for validity against the sha hash that we store, and once confirmed, is used to decrypt the password.
The problem is, we would like to start offering a service that retrieves data from the apis we interact with at scheduled intervals(outside the scope of synchronous user requests.).  If we do this, our current security structure will no longer be viable.
My question is, are there any ways to allow for this type of api interaction without storing recoverable versions the passwords in our database?  If not, what are my options for securely storing passwords?

I am not sure about the entire procedure of how IPFS works under the hood, but I understood that the files will be stored mainly based on their hash. 
Is there a possibility that, due to the amount of files that a worldwide IPFS model can store (so then same amount of hashes will be generated), algorithms like SHA-2 reach a limit about the amount of unique hashes that it can generate (knowing that 2^256, which is pretty big)? 
","You would have to generate hashes for about 2^128 different files in order to find a single collision in a 256-bit hash by chance.
That number is much larger than the number of atoms in the universe, so the probability of that happening is extremely small.
It's much more likely that some problem will eventually be found in the hash function, allowing someone to create collisions on purpose.

","You got the same result in both cases. It's just encoded differently. The openssl command encodes it as hex and your function uses base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString() to encode it as base64.

","There is little difference between SHA-1 and SHA-512 from a password security viewpoint, both can be computed in under 1us. There are reasons to upgrade from SHA-1 but this isn't one. 
Don't use a hash for password protection, use functions such as PBKDF2 (aka Rfc2898DeriveBytes), password_hash/password_verify, Bcrypt and similar functions.
Passwords are ""cracked"" these days by trying passwords from a 10 million word list. The time to hash a password is < 1us on a laptop, and attacker will be orders of magnitude faster. Unless it is spearfishing an attacker will be happy with the easiest 90%.
The point is to make the attacker spend a lot of time finding passwords by brute force. 
Protecting your users is important, please use secure password methods.

","There are no known practical attacks against SHA-2 in the general case. It's generally considered better to keep hashed passwords secret, though, because there are rainbow tables, dictionary attacks, and other such things.

It's still better to not do this, though. You never know what cryptographic attacks might be developed in the future.

For instance, if I commit a file with content
printfn ""%s"" ""fizz buzz""

will I get back a file with content
printfn ""%s"" ""fizz buzz""

or will I get back file with content
printfn ""%s"" ""fizz bUzz""

and an error or a way of identifying the content checked out was incorrect.
Git uses SHA-1 to do this kind of thing.
Q2 : What happens on a git checkout when the content of file in the .git store becomes corrupted, and it's sha pointer is now 'incorrect'? I have never tried, but what would happen at the git command line when the bits on the disk of a git repo get corrupted?
Q3 : Similarly, what would happen on a TFS checkout when the content of files in the TFS database become corrupted?
","TFS uses MD5 for its checksum.  When you upload a file as part of a changeset or shelveset, you also send the MD5 that you calculated.  The server will also calculate the MD5 of your upload contents to validate that there was no corruption on the wire.  Similarly, when you perform a Get from the server, it will deliver the MD5 of the content and clients will validate that the checksum matches.
As to your question about corruption, I can only speak hypothetically and only from having worked on TFS.  Obviously if your database is corrupt, all bets are off and we make no guarantees as to anything.
When you say ""a TFS checkout"" (after having discussed ""a git checkout"" above it), I assume you mean ""a TFS working folder mapping"".  The only problem should be when you try to do a get of the corrupted file.  For example, if you had a corrupt $/Foo.cs at changeset 42 and you did a get of changeset 42, then it would fail.  Your local version would not be updated on-disk or on the server and you would not be at version 42 locally.
If, however, there existed a $/Foo.cs at version 43 and it was not corrupt, then you should be able to get changeset 43 without problems.  The server would not examine that previous version.
If you had gotten $/Foo.cs at changeset 42 before the database became corrupt, you should be able to check the file out (in the TFS terminology of ""checkout"", meaning to pend an edit), make changes, then check the file in, but there's certainly no guarantee of this.  You would need to make changes, since if a client tries to produce a changeset or shelveset that includes a file with the MD5 of the current shelveset, the server will instruct the client not to bother sending the changes.
Again, this is all fairly hypothetical.  We didn't exhaustively test data corruption scenarios.  Realistically, if your database is corrupt, all bets are off and you should restore from a backup.

Can I use any of this methods - DP, DQ, P, PublicExponent, Q, QInv or GetHashCode
to get the unique data to indentify the key. 
My requirment is to get human readable string from the rsa key (like KeyId) so has to identify each rsa key uniquely. It might be some KeyId or thumbprint/fingureprint 
","If the public exponent is fixed (usually 65537) you should just use some of the low-order bits of the public key modulus to form an index, but don't bother with the very lowest-order bit because it's always ""1"". This is of course very fast.
By using only the public key you don't risk leaking information about the private key into the index. If you are storing both private and public keys in the same database then you can do something like append a ""1"" bit then take the original index and append either a ""1"" bit or a ""0"" bit depending on whether the public or private key is being indexed.

"53660986","Java - The value of a salt stored in a file and the value of the same salt retrieved from file are different","I'm making a basic user authentication system on console in java. The user enters their username and password and I store the encrypted password with SHA-512 in a file. Then I prompt the user to ""log in"" and i need to validate that the password they input this time is the password they entered when they ""signed up"". The problem arises in the validation part. When i store the password, I store the salt along with it in the file. But because the salt is a byte[] array, it shows the same [B@232204a1 when i convert it to a string and store it in the file.
Through this answer what i did was that i stored the salt byte array values in a string by concatenating them together so it'd be a continuous value and easier to read during validation.
In the validation part, i read the stored salt correctly, but when i use .getBytes() and then use the same code from the link above, it ouputs a different value than the one i had stored. And hence when i use it to calculate the hashed password, it obviously gives me the wrong answer.

","Your function looks fine and should output a correct salted SHA-1 hash.
However, the storage scheme prefix in your LDIF file should be {SSHA} (for salted SHA1) instead of {SHA} - or you did not intend to use salt (?).
Also, the actual output of a hash algorithm is binary data which can be represented in hexadecimal or base64 strings. LDAP storage schemes use base64 encoding.
What can you do ? 

In your LDIF we can recognize hex strings, so the first thing is to make that hash encoded in base64 instead of hexadecimal, depending on imported base64 package : 
// Using org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64 
generatedPassword = Base64.encodeBase64String(bytes);

// Using java.util.Base64 
generatedPassword = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(bytes);

If you don't want to salt, you need to comment out the following line (with an empty salt string it is still ""salt"" and won't yield the same output as no salting) : 
md.update(salt.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));

Set the proper storage scheme prefix according to the point above. For example, using SHA-1 with salt, the password attribute value in ldif should look like this :
userPassword: {SSHA}<base64_encoded_hash>


A few other things to consider :

OpenLDAP supports the following encryption scheme : SHA, SSHA, MD5, SMD5 and CRYPT. 
SHA and SSHA both use SHA-1 algorithm. 
To bring support for SHA-2 and its variants, use slapd's pw-sha2 overlay (support for SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SSHA-224, SSHA-256, SSHA-384). It can be either compiled statically with slapd, or loaded dynamically since it has module support enabled.

"44344026","PHP/MySQL: Hashing common data","I am looking at my current database set up and it consists of a silly amount of user full home addresses in about 7 different tables, all with a varying degree of inconsistent data (due to the way people can type their postcode with/without spaces, for example).
The application in question is not yet live - not far off full completion but still not live, so any change now would be much easier than say 6 months down the line when there's a ridiculous amount of data in the tables.
Would it be worth my while to spend a few hours refactoring the code/database that handles user home addresses and instead of inserting the full one every time, using a hashing algorithm?
This would give us much greater consistency and could obviously be set up in a way that users could share an address hash and so therefore we could even search them by address much easier.
We currently use this method with storing user agents - hash the UA String and store it in its own separate table alongside a Medium Text column for the actual UA string to go, then instead we store the UA Hash in tables that require it (see below), and use SHA1. However, what options are available to me in terms of non-collision based hashing, but you've also seen to execute in the quickest possible time in a small-medium scale production environment?

This means that the two obvious ones, MD5/SHA1 are 100% not happening, and I don't really work with hashes bigger than that unfortunately. 
For the record, for the password encryption I use password_hash so don't freak out!
Obviously a user's home address is much more important than a user agent string which is why I'm asking what you'd recommend.
Thanks
","For those of you wondering, I went with SHA256.  
I didn't realise there's actually a function in openssl to benchmark hashing algorithms, which can be used like: openssl speed alg1 alg2 alg3 etc
Looking at the 64/256 byte results in the table below, although obviously it doesn't perform as quick as MD5/SHA1, I've decided its still quick enough for the production anyway.
I thought I'd post this and let anyone who doesn't know about openssl speed have a go.

"56142850","How to create a Hash Code from Source Code in C#?","The problem:
I am trying to create a function that creates a hash code of the source code of my asp.net web application backend.
As long as nothing gets changed, this hash code needs to be identical. Even if I rebuild my project.
Does someone know, how I can do that?
What I tried:
The only working solution I found is to concat all important files to a big string and create a hash code out of it.
The problem of this solution is, that I have to add all the source files to the output directory, what shouldn't be done for security reasons.
Hope someone has a great idea =)
Thanks in advance!
Update:
I could solve my problem by enabling deterministic build as Renat suggested.
Just added the deterministic flag to my .csproj file as follows:
<Deterministic>True</Deterministic>

","
Even if I rebuild my project

You may use Deterministic Build, then it will produce the same binaries in each build being made out of same source codes. Then you may get the hash of binaries.

the correct idiom for determining the SHA of the current commit on a remote branch? Are there side effects to performing the fetch that make this overdone? Is there another way?
","You are correct. Unlike tools like SVN, Git only stores and uses information locally.
If you want to see the very latest activity that may have been performed on a remote repo you can either:

git fetch
Remotely browse the repo, if the owner has enabled it.

Running git fetch regularly may not be a problem depending on you network etc. However, even with SVN, most people don't care about other commits until they themselves are ready to commit so having your repo updated every 60s is probably overkill.
Git users often commit and push their feature branch and so also don't care about other branches until integration time, which might be later and done in a different repo.
You need to make a choice that makes sense for your workflow and setup. However if you are migrating from a centralised model (such as SVN) don't be afraid to let go and try something more ""Git'sh"" for a time :-)
With regard to remote browsing. Git comes with a subcommand called instaweb git instaweb --help that will be able to serve repo info via browser

","Caveat: Your tags ""linux shell"" do not specify a specific shell. POSIX sh, the standard specifying minimum required behavior for /bin/sh, does not support arrays; you should use a specific shell, such as bash or ksh, which does. To do this, you need to start your script with an appropriate shebang (such as #!/bin/bash instead of #!/bin/sh), and do any manual invocations with the correct shell (so bash -x myscript if you would otherwise use sh -x myscript... though if you've set the shebang correctly and have +x permissions, you can always just ./myscript)

# this is broken
FILES=PTscalar_1.0/mibenchforpt/security/sha/*.s

...does not create an array.
# this works in bash, ksh, and zsh
files=( PTscalar_1.0/mibenchforpt/security/sha/*.s )

does create an array, which can be expanded as ""${files[@]}"". So:
# this works in bash and ksh, and probably zsh
for file in ""${files[@]}""; do
  ...
done

However, in this particular case, you don't have a reason to use an array at all:
# this works with absolutely any POSIX-compatible shell
for file in PTscalar_1.0/mibenchforpt/security/sha/*.s; do
  echo ""$sfile""
  objectFile=${sfile%.s}.o
  exefile=${objectFile%.o}.ex

  simplescalar/bin/sslittle-na-sstrix-as -o ""$objectFile"" ""$sfile""
done

Note a few corrections made in the above:

The right-hand-side of assignments in with no literal whitespace in their syntax do not need to be quoted.
All expansions (such as $objectFile) do need to be quoted, so, ""$objectFile"".
...yes, this does include echo; to test this, run s='*' and compare the output of echo $s to echo ""$s"".

simplescalar/bin/sslittle-na-sstrix-ld -o ""$exefile"" ""${ofiles[0]}"" ""${ofiles[1]}""

https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/
A given password is hashed (SHA-1) and then the first 5 characters of the hash is compared against the commonly used ones. This service is exposed via API. This could mean that the first 5 digits of the hash is exposed to the outside world. Isn't that a risk the API users are taking?
What is the probability of finding the possible passwords (eg: rainbow tables) if the first 5 digits of the SHA-1 hashed value is known?
Also if we don't find a matching record - that indicates that the password is not in the list of pwned set. Isn't that a clue that the password is outside this set?
","Everything you've asked (and why the first comment in response to your question isn't relevant) is either answered in the blog post you linked to or in the ensuing discussion in the comments. In short:
The first 5 chars means there are 16^35 different possible suffixes. The total possible values the original password could be is infinite.
You could make an argument that the law of probability dictates the underlying password is more likely to be one already in HIBP and in there with a higher prevalence count, but from the hash prefix alone you have absolutely nothing to verify that assumption.
And even if you could reliably guess the actual password, there's no context of the username it's associated to. Depending on how it's queried, there may also be no context as to which service is checking the API hence no information about where the password is actually used.
And if you're still paranoid after all that, just download the hashes and use them locally 🙂

","To extend someWhereElse's comment.  SHA padding extends the message to the next block boundary.  At the end of the message add a 1 bit (not byte) followed by zero bits until 64 bits from the end of the block.  Use the last 64 bits of the block to hold the length of the message in binary.
Your padded block is made up of:
616263 : ""abc"" - the message text.
8      : ""1000"" - the 1 bit to start the padding, followed by padding zeros.
0...0  : The rest of the padding zero bits.

foo($_POST['task_specific_notes']);
foo($task_specific_notes);

function foo($s) {
    echo '<pre>';
    for($i=0;$i<strlen($s); $i++) {
        printf('%02X ', ord($s[$i]));
    }
    echo '</pre>';
}

The connection to the MySQL server has an encoding ""attached"" to it as well.
So if for example the input from the browser is utf-8 encoded but the MySQL connection uses latin-1 you can easily get differently encoded strings.

Is there a hashing algorithm that will produce an unique hash?

","Most hashing algorithms are doing their best to avoid collisions. SHA 512 ought to be fine for you, if not SHA 256. Note that if you can see collisions in the input data, there will be collisions in the hashes, in which case I recommend appending something else likely unique to two separate accounts - such as the timestamp they were created - before inputting the value into the hash. This will work just fine so long as both inputs are immutable and they never change on the account. 
You can use crypto.getHashes() to view available hashes and pick the one you want. You are asking after uniqueness and not security so faster is better.

I've read all the tutorials, and instructions from Google Developers Console about requesting an API Key. As far as I know, an API Key depends on a SHA1 Fingerprint of the keystore you're using to test your app. That's just fine, I got my API Key and everything works on my Development environment. 
The problem is that my boss, at the moment of testing, can't get to see the maps, I think cause his ""dev_keystore"" SHA1 defers from mine, so there must be an Authentication problem. (that i know right)
But what bothers me the most is that there is another app that he (or someone on his team) builded, I get that app to my development environment, runs it with his API Key, and it works... even using my dev_keystore i guess...
So my question is: is it possible to create an API Key that works on every environment, regarthless the key_store SHA1 and stuffs ? I mean, how in hell is that API Key configured that works fine on my computer, as well as in his.?
","Ok, i figured out what's going on.. The default keystore that comes with titanium studio is the same for every installment of it. So the other developers might have (and the did) created an API Key for those apps with the default keystore, and that's why it is working on every environment. 
I bet that when my boss tries to publish that app, it will not work at all. he'll need to create a more app-related API Key, but that's another story to tell.

The goal is to find the sha-256 hash of a file dropped in a dropzone. The problem is that the hash being returned is different from online hash checkers (which are returning the seemingly correct values). Here is my code:
const crypto = require(""crypto"");
const hash = crypto.createHash(""sha256"");

handleOnDrop = file => {
    hash.update(file);

I am fairly sure the hash values I am getting from this code is not just the file name, I checked a few permutations with the online checkers.
Any ideas? Thanks!
","Dropzone events return a File class object, this object is based on the Blob class and doesn't provide direct access to the data of the file.  In order to use the data in the file, you must use the FileReader class as outlined in the Mozilla examples
Crypto is expecting a buffer when you call hash.update, but file isn't a Buffer like it would be in these examples. Dropping a Blob into hash.update probably doesn't have the behavior you are expecting.
So, assuming you're using WebPack to provide access to the Node standard libraries, your code should need to do something like this:
  handleOnDrop = ((file) => {
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onload = ((event) => {
      hash.update(Buffer.from(event.target.result));
      const hashOutput = hash.digest(""hex"");

After seeing this kind of thing over and over again, my question becomes how do I figure out the encoding of the Base64-looking ""password"" strings?  If these strings were actual (MD5/SHA1-looking) hashes, it seems like one could try and recover the plaintext by checking rainbow tables, but I don't see anyway to get from the point of ""I have a random non-hex string"" to ""Here's how I know (x) is the hash from which that random string was derived.""
How does one identify ""password"" strings from POST entries (like the above) as a given encoding, and then convert them back to actual password hashes?
","They probably are not hashes. They are random strings.
If they were Base64 encoded, they would have a different length (it would be divisible by 4).
So probably these are attempts to login into accounts the spammers created earlier (or believe they created earlier)?
HTTP forms usually submit passwords in plaintext, which is why you should use https.

","Generally, you don't need to encrypt hash as long as you use good cryptographic hash function. As for salt, salting is done best before encrypting, ie. salt does get encrypted. The exception would be one-time table, in which case you can easily salt afterwards. As for the third question, whole encryption is nothing but increasing the time it takes to ""guess"" the plaintext, exception being again one-time table. Now what's your concrete problem?

","SHA-256 is injective. You give it the same input, it will give you the same output. It is not surjective, however. If m1 and m2 both hash to h, you cannot conclude that m1 = m2, even if you know that |m1| = |m2| (both messages are of the same length).
Therefore, applying SHA-256 (or any deterministic function) cannot increase the entropy of your data. At best, it won't decrease it. In other words: If your data is 16 purely random bytes, it won't be “more than purely random” after you hash it. And if your data was not purely random to begin with, then hashing it won't help making it random. You have to use a better entropy source in the first place.
Another problem that you didn't mention is that you currently have 16 random bytes but if you put them into your SHA-256 hash function, you'll get 32 bytes out. Which ones are you going to use? If you only use every second byte – due to injectivity – you won't get all possible bit patterns even if your input was perfectly random and the hash function was flawless. (If you did, then this would – by the pidgin hole principle – mean that the other half of the bytes would always be a function of the bytes you did chose. Only a really crappy hash function, which SHA-256 of course is not, would have such property.) If you try to be clever and combine the bytes in some “smart” way, chances are that you'll make things even worse.
So the short answer is: just don't do it. Generate as many random bytes as you need using the strongest non-deterministic entropy source you have available and use them directly.

","Your code computes the SHA-256 hash of the first half (0x200=512 bits or 64 bytes) of the array M, initialized to 0xe8 , 0x9d , ... , 0x76.

I tested the hmac with sha512, as far as I can tell that is correct, so the error should be in the get_truncate function, which does work with sha1, but not with sha512.

"46856459","How can I create a commit with a new SHA in git?","I need to create an equivalent commit object with a different SHA in Git. All commits are GPG signed. I know that I can change author + commit timestamps, but the resolution is only a second, and we are not permitted to deviate from the system clock by more than a second. I also cannot change commit messages, author / commiter names and emails and / or the key used to sign the commit. Which other fields of the commit can I change in order to get a different commit message?

Motivation: We are using an internal tool which for some reason does not work if two properties reference the same commit, even though we are setting it intentionally.
","The technical answer to the question is this:
The hashed data includes:

a header you don't control (and that is, in any case, derived from the other data I'm about to mention)
the commit's TREE object hash - a reflection of the commit content
the parent COMMIT object(s) hash(es)
Author name,email,timestamp
Committer name,email,timestamp
Commit message

Varying the TREE may stretch the definition of ""equivalent"" commit.  You've explicitly ruled out changing the commit message or author / committer info.  The remaining option is the commit parent list, but whether that makes any sense to talk about depends on what it is you're doing.
So since options are limited, let's take a quick look at each of these (even the ones that seem to be excluded):
TREE object: This uniquely represents the content - i.e. what data you would see in what files at what paths in the working tree.  At a glance, this seems like the thing that must be unchanged to meet the most basic definition of ""equivalent commit"".  Of course, any change - no matter how small, no matter where in the work tree - would change the hash, so maybe you could wedge in a file or directory specifically for nonce values to vary the hash?
Author or committer Info: First thing to think about: How sensitive is the requirement not to touch names?  Could you stick an invisible character at the end of the name and be ok, or do they have to match bit-for-bit?
Alternately, those time stamps... Saying you can't vary from the system clock, when the commit timestamp is defined to refer to commit creation time anyway, seems pedantic unless you're trying to create several equivalent commits all at once.  Even if you need two at the same time, you should be able to do that without exceeding your tolerance.
Commit Message: Again, how strict is the requirement not to change this?  Could you get by with a newline, or at least an invisible character?
Parent Commit: If you're still at brick walls with all of the above, then here's what's left.  And this really boils down to, what are the commits for?  Is the duplicate commit going to have the same parent?
P -- A
 \
  A'

In that case you can't really do anything here.  But alternately, if it's parallel trees of commits:
P -- A

P' -- A'

Well, then all you need to do is seed each tree with a root commit that differs in some way.  Commit messages like ""Root commit 1"", ""Root commit 2"", ..., for example?

","The issue is that a ByteString is a sequence of bytes, while a String is a sequence of chars. There are many ways to turn chars into bytes, so you need to specify which encoding you want.

","Look closer at the logs, and I will see that the service ticket has expired. Turns out,  the bump from SHA-1 to SHA256  made the network trip from 6 seconds 13 seconds, and the TTL for the service ticket expired.

","It looks like your convert stream grows continuously for each iteration, appending the new value each time. The easiest fix is to move the declaration of stringstream convert; inside the for loop to create a new one each time. 
Further optimisations are certainly possible as it's not efficient to convert numbers to strings the way you are doing it for the large number of iterations in the main loop.

That is SSL (https) for. There is no reason not to use SSL

so nobody with beginning/medium knowledge in Chrome debugging and HTTP scrapping can simply decode these data. The script itself will be deeply obfuscated.

Often it is not so effective. If data are user entered or displayed,  there is no reason to encrypt them. If data are provided from the server and  not to be displayed, you can encrypt the data properly on the server side. 
client-side encryption is usually feasible if you want to store or resend data encrypted or signed to other systems. 
Usually adding more complexity doesn't add security. 

I read there are some RSA libraries for javascript to encrypt/decrypt data

Just search for some https://gist.github.com/jo/8619441 or there is CryptoWebAPI https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API
the issue is - are you sure you need RSA? How would you manage and exchange keys? How would you ensure key authenticity? 

but I hear like RSA is old and slow 

RSA is old and slow and yet used and secure (when implemented properly). RSA is used along other (symmetric) ciphers to ensure speed and effectiveness. It is called hybrid cryptosystem 
There are two used asymetric systems, RSA and ECC. Regardless that using ssl will ensure confidentiality and integrity, in most of the cases you would need to really justify using RSA on the client side

","A quick look on Wikipedia finds this: 

SHA-256 and SHA-512 are novel hash functions computed with 32-bit and
  64-bit words, respectively. They use different shift amounts and
  additive constants, but their structures are otherwise virtually
  identical, differing only in the number of rounds. SHA-224 and SHA-384
  are simply truncated versions of the first two, computed with
  different initial values.

Looking at the comparison between all the variants, it seems that SHA-384 is more resistant to length extension attacks than SHA-512 (its longer version).

","Your code, if not very efficient, looks fine except for one thing:
hexOut = hex(int(b2,2))

as the output of hex
>>> hex(int('01110110000101',2))
'0x1d85'

starts with 'Ox', which shouldn't be part of the key. So, you should be fine by removing these two characters.
For the number of possible keys to try, you have:

1 with no bit flipped
128 with 1 bit flipped
128*127/2 = 8128 with 2 bits flipped (128 ways to choose the first one, 127 ways to choose the second, and each pair will appear twice)
128*127*126/6 = 341376 with 3 bits flipped (each triplet appears 6 times). This is the number of combinations of 128 bits taken 3 at a time.

So, the total is 1 + 128 + 8128 + 341376 = 349633 possibilities.
Your code tests each of them many times. You could avoid a the useless repetitions by looping like this (for 3 bits):
for x in range (0, 128):
    for y in range(x+1, 128):
        for z in range(y+1, 128):
            .....

You could adapt your trick of starting at -2 with:
for x in range (-2, 128):
    for y in range(x+1, 128):
        for z in range(y+1, 128):
            .... same code you used ...


You could also generate the combinations with itertools.combinations:
from itertools import combinations
for x, y, z in combinations(range(128), 3):  # for 3 bits
    ......

but you'd need a bit more work to manage the cases with 0, 1, 2 and 3 flipped bits in this case.

    try {

        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, new IvParameterSpec(INITIALIZATIO_VECTOR.getBytes(""UTF-8"")));
        rawEnc = cipher.doFinal(origString.getBytes(""UTF-8""));
        encoded = Base64.encodeBase64(rawEnc);
        encryptedString = new String(encoded, ""UTF-8"");

    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {

What I want to ask is whether it could be considered secure or if there is any better, more efficient way to do this.

""Could be considered secure"" isn't asking much. I consider it secure against unauthorized login, as long as an attacker doesn't have access to the device, the network, or the database. A straightforward system that transmits and stores the password in cleartext would also be secure in that kind of situation. It would make more sense to ask with a specific security goal and threat model in mind.
Here are a few key problems that this design:

If an attacker can get the hashes from the database, they can log in by computing sha256([hash] + unixTime) without knowing the password.
An attacker that controls the network can intercept a sha256([hash] + unixTime), unixTime pair and use it verbatim. SSL would prevent such an attacker from obtaining those values.
If an attacker can get the hashes from the database, they can quickly try hashing passwords and see which users' hashes match. Salted hashes would prevent this.

","It sounds like in addition to saying you don't want to use a self signed cert that you're also oppossed to using https even if it was a certificate issued from a trusted certificate authority; is that so and if so why? Having your password in plaintext even once is a significant vulnerability; that plaintext password is free game to anyone running packet capture software on machines that your network traffic traverses, not to mention that if you've chosen the wrong http method then those passwords will definitely end up sitting in the logs of any proxies along the way. 
I'd also suggest that at the least you store your passwords properly salted. Not doing so results in a number of security weaknesses if your database is retrieved by a malicious party; for example pre generated rainbow table attacks would be feasible as well as an attacker being able to easily identify which users have identical passwords thanks to the hashes matching. There's a great Owasp writeup on the key things you should look out for here.
Is using a solution like oauth an option? I recently implemented Google OAuth in a mobile application and it was pretty straightforward in combination with ssl. No need to reinvent the wheel, especially when it comes to crypto and user auth ;)

On Ubuntu, my shell is running ""en_US.UTF-8"".
I've run into the case where the signature is different on different systems: AIX, Windows w/Ubuntu, Windows w/Powershell, etc. I'm trying to figure out why.
","There are at least three problems here: Powershell pipelines aren't binary-safe, you have the wrong variable name, and echo isn't portable/reliable.

At least according to this question, you can't pipe binary data in Powershell. The output of openssl (which is raw binary data) is getting treated as UTF-8 text (presumably due to $OutputEncoding), and mangled in the process. You can tell by decoding from base64 and looking in hex instead:
$ echo '77u/W8O5RwJeBsOodDddXeKUlCQD4pSUduKVrD3ilIxADQo=' | base64 -D | xxd
00000000: efbb bf5b c3b9 4702 5e06 c3a8 7437 5d5d  ...[..G.^...t7]]
00000010: e294 9424 03e2 9494 76e2 95ac 3de2 948c  ...$....v...=...
00000020: 400d 0a                                  @..

It starts with EF BB BF, which is a UTF-8 byte order mark; and it ends with 0D 0A, which is a DOS/Windows line ending (ASCII carriage return and linefeed characters). Something else bad is happening as well, since it's much too long for a sha1 hash, even if you account for the BOM and line ending.
The output of echo is probably getting mangled similarly, so even if the hash wasn't mangled it'd be the hash of the wrong byte sequence.
See this question (and its answer) for an example of using Powershell's  own tools to compute the HMAC-SHA1 of a string.
The message to be signed is in $message, but you actually sign $string_to_sign, which is undefined. The Ubuntu result is the correct HMAC-SHA1 for the null string:
$ </dev/null openssl sha1 -hmac ""706Fdj+LFKf8pf/2Wh5V8Q8jbgGUUQo3xSXr5sbt"" -binary | openssl base64
NCRRWG4nL9sN8QMrdmCPmUvNlYA=

As Lorinczy Zsigmond pointed out, echo -en isn't predictable. Under some implementations/OSes/shells/compile & runtime options/phases of moon/etc, it might or might not print ""-en"" as part of its output, and maybe also print a newline (or something) at the end. Use printf instead:
printf 'GET\n\n\n%s\n/%s%s' ""${now}"" ""${bucket}"" ""${path}"" | openssl sha1 ...

Or (in bash, but not all other shells):
printf -v message 'GET\n\n\n%s\n/%s%s' ""${now}"" ""${bucket}"" ""${path}""
printf '%s' ""$message"" | openssl sha1 ...

Or (bash again):
nl=$'\n'

We got a programm which encrypts data and need to know wether it's using SHA-1 or SHA-2.

I assume you mean that you're hashing data. SHA is a family of hashing algorithms, not encryption algorithms.
The primary way you would distinguish is their lengths. SHA-1 is 160 bits (20 bytes). SHA-2 comes in several forms, from 224 to 512 bits (28-64 bytes). Note that there are some truncated versions of SHA-2, so it can be difficult to be certain exactly which one is being used, but they're all longer than SHA-1.

","You probably mean hashing not encryption. encryption is reversible, hashing is not, encryption is like random permutation as opposed to hash which tries to be like a random function. 
SHA-1 is 160bit (20 bytes) long, while SHA-2 is a family of hash functions 224-512 bits long (28-32 bytes). 
Note you may have hex-encoding or base64 encoding which will give you 4 or 6 bits per encoded character. 
In some cases (for example password hashing) it is customary to prefix hashes with information on how they were created and you would see hash strings start with some special prefix such as $1$ which tells you what you are looking at. 
If you do not have an extra prefix and have the data truncated to the same length, and you do not know anything about the input before the hashing I do not believe you can discern between the two by any practical means. An ability to tell the difference between SHA-1 and truncated SHA-2 would mean at least one of them can be separated from random data which we require secure cryptographic functions to be undistingishable from. 
I am unaware of a practical distinguishing attack. 
Regardless of computational complexity you can't tell where a single hash came from with high probability since most hashes have a pre-image also from the other function.

variable s = 'SHA-512/t' REPLACE t with value of t, for example 256:
variable s = 'SHA-512/256'

Now perform the normal SHA-512 algorithm on that string, but use the previously generated H(0)'' values as H for SHA-512
variable H(0) = SHA-512(s)

This results in 8 64 bit words, use thoose words as H values for your SHA-512/t algorithm.
For Example:
SHA-512 with H(0)'' as H on the string 'SHA-512/256' results in this string (In Hex):

My question is whether modern cryptographic hash functions, such as SHA256, are periodic in this sense? In other words, are there some integers 0 <= n and 0 < k such that HASH(n + b) = HASH(n + b + ak) for all integers b in [0, k - 1] and all positive integers a? For example, will the sequence SHA256(0), SHA256(1), SHA256(2), SHA256(3), ... be periodic after some point?
","Absolutely not. If that was the case it would be trivial to find a collision. The strength of a cryptographic hash function is defined by how hard it is to find Hash(a) == Hash(b). Ideally you need to find all values of Hash(b) to find a collision, which is infeasible if Hash is a lot of bits.

require 'digest'

How do you just look at this algorithm and find the results are the same no matter what bytes you perform the operation on first.

intermediate_value is a pure function of byte. Neither the position of the byte nor what values precede or follow it affect the intermediate_value.
outHash is the sum of the intermediate values.
The commutative law of addition tells us that the sum will be the same regardless of the order of the bytes.
So you can re-order the input as you wish - the hash value will stay the same.

Is there an equivalent for Hash?

Sorry - here is some background.  I'm doing some spark-map/reduce comparisons, and I'd like to make sure the hash's in memory are stored as efficiently as possible.

from the comments it sounds like I should store them in byte-array.  So that would mean converting the string to hash-object and then getting the byte array...
","You can convert a String to a byte array simply by using the String.getBytes() method. Note that this returns the bytes that compose the string representation of the hash value, not the numeric value of the hash.
Instead, assuming your hash values are hexadecimal (base 16) encoded strings then you can use Google's guava library. It has a Hashing class with hashing utilities. It has a HashCode class that stores the hash value, e.g. in byte array (BytesHashCode). This class has a fromString(string) method to create a HashCode instance from which you can get the byte array / long / int representation of the actual value. This class is more-or-less equivalent to UUID in your example.

I found pico256, header only, I can integrate into a project.  But I can't find both hash functions I need.  I am not sure if I can just rip the bits out I want from OpenSSL, it's too big and complex.
If I can find a reasonable description of sha256 and ripemd160, I might have a go at implementing them myself.
Until then, does anyone know of either
a) standalone sha256 and ripemd160 C or C++ code I can compile into a project, or
b) a small library I can static link into a project?
I'm not sure how to do that with OpenSSL; I'm on Windows 10 and it always seems to want a DLL it generates for shared libraries.  Maybe I'm just not building correctly for static linking without DLLs.

Does that mean that i is a signed value and if so what happens on overflow?
","Nothing says that it would be signed.  The fact that dkLen is capped at (2^32 - 1) * hLen suggests that it's an unsigned integer, and that it cannot roll over from 0xFFFFFFFF (2^32 - 1) to 0x00000000.
Of course, PBKDF2(MD5) wouldn't hit 2^31 until you've asked for 34,359,738,368 bytes.  That's an awful lot of bytes.

SHA-1: 42,949,672,960
SHA-2-256 / SHA-3-256: 68,719,476,736
SHA-2-384 / SHA-3-384: 103,079,215,104
SHA-2-512 / SHA-3-512: 137,438,953,472

Since the .NET implementation (in Rfc2898DeriveBytes) is an iterative stream it could be polled for 32GB via a (long) series of calls.  Most platforms expose PBKDF2 as a one-shot, so you'd need to give them a memory range of 32GB (or more) to identify if they had an error that far out.  So even if most platforms get the sign bit wrong... it doesn't really matter.
PBKDF2 is a KDF (key derivation function), so used for deriving keys.  AES-256 is 32 bytes, or 48 if you use the same PBKDF2 to generate an IV (which you really shouldn't).  Generating a private key for the ECC curve with a 34,093 digit prime is (if I did my math right) 14,157 bytes.  Well below the 32GB mark.

","i ranges from 1 to l = CEIL (dkLen / hLen), and dkLen and hLen are positive integers. Therefore, i is strictly positive.
You can, however, store i in a signed, 32-bit integer type without any special handling. If i rolls over (increments from 0x7FFFFFFF to 0xF0000000), it will continue to be encoded correctly, and continue to increment correctly. With two's complement encoding, bitwise results for addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same as long as all values are treated as either signed or unsigned.

This code gets a ""401"" from the external service.
My first issue is that there does not seem to be a NET method named SHA2. The closest I could find is SHA512 and I am not sure if SHA512 is a .NET implementation of SHA2.
Secondly, padding for AES has been specified as PKCS5Padding but again the closest (naming-wise) I could find is PKCS7 which I am not sure about how similar it is to PKCS5.
There is also the matter of an Initialisation Vector (IV), which the AES parameters don't specify but I see C# AES examples including. In the code, I have set it to have the same value as the Key (which I believe
is what the API calls ""secret key"") out of sheer desperation but I have tried making the request without setting IV to any value and still get back a 401.
I should probably also mention that I am using ASCII encoding to convert to-and-from bytes because I first tried using UTF8 but when it came to actually making the HTTP request, I was getting an exception
saying that header values (remember we are generating an authorisation key that will be tucked in a HTTP request header) should only be encoded in ASCII.
Any help pointing me in the right direction will be immensely appreciated as I am woefully out of my depth with this cryptography stuff.
","Don't worry, crypto can feel overwhelmingly complicated. I think you're close.

SHA2 is a family of hash functions. In practice, ""SHA2"" usually means SHA2-256 or occasionally SHA2-512. My guess is that your external API is probably using the more common SHA2-256.
This answer on crypto.stackexchange explains that PKCS#5 is essentially a subset of PKCS#7. I'd be willing to bet that the API you're calling made the same mistake described in that answer and should really be calling it PKCS7Padding. Your code is fine!
The IV isn't the same thing as the secret key (or just the ""key"" for AES). The IV should be random for every encryption run. You aren't supposed to derive it from the input plaintext or the input key. Fortunately, AesCryptoServiceProvider.GenerateIV() will generate one for you. It's up to you to prepend it to your output stream, though.
Using Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes() to get the plaintext and secret key bytes makes sense to me. I don't think that's causing a problem.

Stealing from this excellent answer to a similar question (go give them a vote!), I'd try code like this:
static byte[] AesEncrypt(byte[] data, byte[] key)
{
    if (data == null || data.Length <= 0)
    {
        throw new ArgumentNullException($""{nameof(data)} cannot be empty"");
    }

    if (key == null || key.Length != AesKeySize)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException($""{nameof(key)} must be length of {AesKeySize}"");
    }

    using (var aes = new AesCryptoServiceProvider
    {
        Key = key,
        Mode = CipherMode.CBC,
        Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7
    })
    {
        aes.GenerateIV();
        var iv = aes.IV;
        using (var encrypter = aes.CreateEncryptor(aes.Key, iv))
        using (var cipherStream = new MemoryStream())
        {
            using (var tCryptoStream = new CryptoStream(cipherStream, encrypter, CryptoStreamMode.Write))
            using (var tBinaryWriter = new BinaryWriter(tCryptoStream))
            {
                // prepend IV to data
                cipherStream.Write(iv);
                tBinaryWriter.Write(data);
                tCryptoStream.FlushFinalBlock();
            }
            var cipherBytes = cipherStream.ToArray();

            return cipherBytes;
        }
    }
}

Unless there's something else weird going on with this API, I'd guess it's probably #3 above that is causing your request to fail.

There is also the matter of an Initialisation Vector (IV), which the AES parameters don't specify but I see C# AES examples including. In the code, I have set it to have the same value as the Key (which I believe
is what the API calls ""secret key"") out of sheer desperation but I have tried making the request without setting IV to any value and still get back a 401.
I should probably also mention that I am using ASCII encoding to convert to-and-from bytes because I first tried using UTF8 but when it came to actually making the HTTP request, I was getting an exception
saying that header values (remember we are generating an authorisation key that will be tucked in a HTTP request header) should only be encoded in ASCII.
Any help pointing me in the right direction will be immensely appreciated as I am woefully out of my depth with this cryptography stuff.
","I finally managed to get it to work.
A big part of the problem was that API documentation did not specify that hashedString has to
be composed of hexadecimal characters.
It also didn't say that authKey should be a base64 string.
I don't know if this is so standard that it goes without saying but knowing this could have 
saved me hours of agony. I was converting the hashed/encrypted bytes back to ASCII
and much of it was unprintable characters that were causing the server to send back
a HTTP response with status 400 BAD_REQUEST.
It also required hashedString to be hashed using SHA256 but the documentation does not mention it.
Thanks to @Nate Barbettini's answer for steering me in the right direction on this.
Also, it appears that AES ECB mode does not require an initialisation vector unlike other
modes like CBC so I didn't specify an IV.
For padding I specified PKCS7 (again thanks to @Nate Barbettini for that).
With that here's the code that finally worked out for me.

Thank you everyone and thank you for this lovely site.
","Obfuscation is a two way street. You want to be able to both obfuscate something and after deobfuscate and use it.
SHA is a hash function. It's one way street. If you took a hash of something, you can't go back to original value.
As result. You can't use SHA for obfuscation.

We are intending to upload the data into Amazon S3 on a routine basis (daily or weekly). But first, it is vital that we scramble or mask the phone numbers, the other fields can be left as is.
Using fruits as analogus to the phone numbers, I explain my below problems.
Options considered. 
1) Aggregate all the data by phone numbers and assign each number a unique value. 
The problem is that this is a not a consistent approach.
1st Time             2nd time 
apple - v1           apple - v1
banana -v2         cherry -v2
cherry -v3 
This can only be an one-off solution at best.
2) Use SHA-1 to generate a hash and store it in some local table. Then we can use this local table to reference the original values from the keys later.
The problem is that SHA-1 might have duplicate hashes even with salt added.Not sure whether possible to maintain unique hash table
apple -  asjdfaslkdfj 
banana - blajsdfkljas 
cherry - blajsdfkljas (is this possible)
3) Use AES to encrypt the data. 
Is it possible to encrypt just a column, cos AES seems to be able to encrypt the whole file.
Another issue, is that speed might become very slow to encrypt so much data. I am just Thinking Out Aloud here.
Can anyone recommend a suitable solution for this problem ?

The code is shown here.
The signature is different from the one generated by another method of JAVA-RSASHA256.
Java used the digest below: The final String is with upper format A-F.
import java.security.MessageDigest;
char hexDigits[] = {'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'};

        str[k++] = hexDigits[byte0 & 0xf];
    }
    return new String(str);
} catch(Exception e) {
    return null;

While I used the python code to generate the digest below.
from OpenSSL import crypto
from Crypto.Hash import SHA256

data = 'hello world!'
hash_256 = hashlib.sha256()
h_sha256 = hash_256.copy()
h_sha256.update(data.encode('utf-8'))
sha256_str = h_sha256.hexdigest()
print('output:', sha256_str)
#The ""print-result"" contains only lower-format 'a-f'.

Will crypto.sign(pkey, data, digest) of Python uses the lowercase digest to generate a signature? So the signature is different from that of java because java takes the uppercase?
The following code is how I import my .p12 file to sign a String.
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

psw = b'123456'
p12 = crypto.load_pkcs12(open(r""D:\tasks\private_key.p12"", 'rb').read(), psw)

public class Message {

This currently gets serialised to:
{
  ""$type"": ""SignedMessage"",
  ""Signature"": {
    // Signature details here
  },
  ""Payload"": ""{\""$type\"": \""Foo\"", \""value\"":\""Bar\"" }""
}

The payload itself is json that has currently must be produced in a prior serialisation step, and conversely has to be deserialised in a following seperate step, this also means the json produced isn't particularly clean since it gets encapsulated within the outer wrapper. The current arrangement allows me to hash the Payload so i can either produce a signature or validate an existing one.
I'd like to be able to make Message generic:
public class Message<T> {
    public Signature Signature { get; set; }
    public <T> Payload { get; set; }
}

Which I can certainly do but then Payload is automatically deserialized (which is good) and I miss my opportunity to calculate a hash for signature verification (which is bad). It leaves me with two options:

Add conditions to T so it implements some interface aiding hash calculation.
While deserializing perform a hash on the raw json of Payload.

The first option sounded OK until i realized that i'd have to the method on EVERY class being serialized and then it sounded terrible.
The deserialisation calculation sounds a lot nicer and makes things more flexible for how and where that hash gets calculated.
The problem is thus far I can't seem to find anything allowing me access to the raw json within the json.net conversion process. Does json.net even feature that capability?
For the most part I'd like to minimize the custom code required for deserialisation, though I have written a few minimal effort converters to make the json neater.

"25713416","Keeping user's API secret of SHA secured in db","I have a mobile app communicating with server over HTTPS. Upon successful signup I return the app a unique API secret to be saved locally on the device. This API secret is used for all private method calls made to server following successful signup from this user.
In the header of each request made to server I put:
""key"":  username
""sign"": (SHA256 of post_parameters using API secret)

Server takes the post_parameters and SHA256 using the username's unique API secret found in db. If result matches ""sign"" then access is granted.
My question is this:
How do I keep each user's unique API secret safe on server db? If someone gets access to usernames and their API secrets, he has full control of user's account.
","You need to store the hash of the secret in the database, but require the user to provide the secret. That way, if the database leaks, then an attacker has the hash, but doesn't have the secret itself. When the user logs on, hash the secret that the user provides, and check whether it matches the stored hash.
To make it more secure yet, you could consider using salt: store a random value (in plaintext) in the database for each user as well, and then when you calculate the hash, you hash the salt plus the secret. So you store
salt_value  H(salt_value . secret)

where . denotes concatenation. This is more secure because if the attacker has a hash dictionary (i.e., has worked out the hash of millions of likely passwords) then he still can't break the hash: his dictionary won't have factored every possible salt value into it.
For ultra-modern security, you can also hash repeatedly. Rather than storing
H(salt_value . secret)

you store
H(H(H(H(...H(salt_value . secret) ...))))

i.e., you hash it a large number of times (say, 10,000 times). When the user logs on, hash the salt and secret repeatedly, and then compare the final result with the stored value. This is even more secure because it takes a lot longer to mount a brute force attack: the attacker will have to calculate 10,000 hashes to try a single guess at a secret.

","I am assuming that all your tx arrays are hash values: looking at SHA1 manpage there is no information about a NULL-terminating byte or character encoding. It just about bytes so I guess you shouldn't try to print it as a string (i.e. with %s).

AND, strlen is likely to return garbage, use explicit length instead:
SHA1(t1, 128, t2);

int res = memcmp(t2, t3, 128);

Or:

"50632444","Is there a universal function F that F(sha(a),sha(b)) = sha(ab)","I am faced with a need to send my data in parts, and at the same time I am expected to provide sha256 for my WHOLE data.
Something like this cat large file | chunker | receiver
where receiver is an application that is expected to receive the data, possibly in chunks having in the header sha256 of the payload, and then following payload. After collecting all chunks, it is supposed to store the whole transmitted data, and the sha256 of all data (particular sha256 will be used only to rehash and confirm integrity of the data.)
Of course, the simplest thing would be if the receiver generated sha256 from whole the streamed data, but I was wondering if there is a simpler way by collecting all hashes of all chunks, and combine them to generate one final hash, which would be the same as the hash calculated from all the data.
In other words - and I copy this from the title - I wonder if there is a function F that would receive a list of hashes of chunks of data, and then generated final hash that would be equal to the hash generated on all the data.
And again, in other words, having this formula:
F(sha256(data[0]), sha256(data[1]), ... sha256(data[N])) = sha256(data[0..N])
What would be the function F?
Would it be a universal function or there is no such thing for the way hashing is calculated?
I suspect there is no such function or this is too complicated question to answer.
","AFAIK there are still no known collisions for SHA-256 but I bet that once some is found, i.e. someone finds two messages m1 and m2 such that SHA-256(m1) = SHA-256(m2), then for almost any prefix a hashes SHA-256(a || m1) and SHA-256(a || m2) will be different i.e. the function you ask is actually not a function (has different outputs for the same inputs). Or to put it otherwise SHA-2 is susceptible to length extension attacks but AFAIK not to prefixing attacks. Still even if this actually a function, it is not enough for you for such a function to exist, you also want it to be fast. And I believe there is no such fast to compute function. 
On the other hand SHA-256 works by splitting the original message into 512-bit chunks and processing them using a well defined process (which is based on the state from all the previous chunks) so theoretically you can modify some implementation of SHA-256 to compute two hashes at the same time (by applying the same logic to different initial states):

Hash of your application-defined chunk (using standard initial state)
Hash of all chunks up to this point (using the state passed from the previous output of the same step as the initial state).

This probably will be slightly faster than doing those things independently but I don't know whether it will be so much faster to justify such a custom implementation.

","According to a Microsoft Support page:
FCIV -md5 -sha1 path\filename.ext

It doesn't look like it's available normally (my up-to-date Win10 doesn't have it). You'll have to download it.
If your scenario lets you use PowerShell, there's the Get-FileHash command which has MD5 and a number of versions of SHA. This might be your best no-download option.
If you really want Windows to have all the small tools that Linux has, you can get a big list of them by downloading GOW (GNU On Windows) and adding it's binaries to your path. This includes sha1sum. These are Windows binaries running in the Windows kernel.
There's always the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) which also has a lot of Linux tools running in a more Linux-like environment but I think that might be a bit over kill for hashing files. These will be Linux binaries running on a version of the Linux kernel. It's actually not bad.

","If you are using the same keystore file, the SHA-1 fingerprint should not be changing. You may need to look into to whether you are creating/deleting debug keystore files or perhaps the expiration on it has been set to be only a few days.
To better avoid the issue, you should generate your own keystore file specifically for your application. You can use the newly generate keystore file to build the application and only that application. No other application should use that keystore file and the application you're working on should only use that keystore file.

","Once you have a byte array from your hex string using hexStringtoByteArray, you can make a string using new String(bytes, ""UTF-8"") where bytes is the byte array from your method. By specifying UTF-8 when creating the string you get characters other than hex.
Therefore the new method would be as follows: 
public String hexStringtoByteArray(String str) { 
    byte[] bytes = new byte[str.length() / 2]; 
    for (int i = 0; i < bytes.length; i++) { 
        bytes[i] = (byte) Integer.parseInt(str.substring(2 * i, 2 * i + 2), 16);

"53452410","Do I need MD5 as a companion to SHA-1?","Do I need both MD5 and SHA-1 values to be sure the downloaded file is
a) Untouched by hackers. For example, when I need to download some app's .iso via torrents
and
b) Not corrupted during technical issues? For example, some unstable network connection during download.
Or, probably, SHA-1 value will be enough for both checks?
Also, is SHA-1 (without MD5) enough to be sure that some file downloaded years ago and stored somewhere on my HDD haven't degradated?
","From a security perspective MD-5 is utterly broken. 
SHA-1 is considered suspicious, and avoided for most uses if at all possible. For new projects: don't use it at all.
SHA-2 (aka SHA-256, SHA-512, etc.) is still widely used for fast hashes.
SHA-3 is the future since 2012, nothing is stopping you from using it already. I see little reason not to use it for new projects.
What's the problem with older ones:

Their resistance to finding collisions is below par: This is an attacker creating 2 contents that have the same hash. These are constructed at the same time. This problem is there for MD5 and SHA-1, and it's BAD, but requires the attacker creating both versions (and then they can do a switch at any time they want undetected).
Their resistance to length extension attacks is relatively weak. This is especially true for MD5, but SHA-1 and even SHA-2 to some degree suffer from it.

When is it not a problem: to ensure your disk has not produced an error: and hash will do, even a simple CRC32 will work wonders (and I'd recommend the simpler CRC check), or a RAID array, as these can fix errors, not just detect them.
Use both ?
Well if you have to find a collision on one hash and have that same set of plaintexts also produce a collision on another hash, is probably more difficult. This approach has been used in the past, The original PGP did something like it. If I'm not mistaken it had a number of things it calculated, one of them simply the length (which would prevent the extension attack above).
So yes, it likely adds something, but the way md5 and SHA-1 and SHA-2 work internally is quite similar, and that's the worrisome part: they are too much alike to be sure just how much it adds against a highly sophisticated attacker (think the level of the NSA and their counterparts).  
So why not use one of the more modern versions of SHA-2, or even better SHA-3 ? They've no known weaknesses and have been peer-reviewed heavily. As such for any commercial level use, they should be more than enough.

I found that ord values generated by both packH in java and pack(""H*"", $str) in php results are the same, but saltBin string looks diffrent. I think that there is a problem, beacause hashSHA256 in java and hashSHA256(""sha256"", $str) in php gives the same result. How to solve this??

The operation of string in Java is different from php
Some operation in your Java's code is not correct.
The follow's code is a solution(passes test):

            int beginIndex = 2 * x - 2;
            String literki = SALT.substring(beginIndex, beginIndex + 2);
            char packLiterki = packH(literki); // (packH(""H*"", substr($salt,2 * $x - 2,2)));

//            saltBin += packLiterki;
            // 1. this should use byte array to save the result
            saltBinBytes[x - 1] = ((byte) packLiterki);

I am pretty sure that I am not doing anything wrong when it comes to the padding as well as the creation of the opad and ipad tables. Perhaps my string to int conversions are off. Perhaps its a weird quirk with Lua 5.3 that I don't know about. I don't know what I am missing here. It could be very obvious, but I am not seeing it at the moment. Thanks in advance for your assistance.
I should add that this implementation is needed for a lua sandbox in which I cannot use other libraries.

","Here is an example of the openssl command chain above converted into openssl API calls that output the base64 result to the screen.
The main calls are 

PEM_read_bio_PrivateKey to read in the private key in PEM format.
i2d_RSA_PUBKEY_bio to convert the RSA public key into DER format
EVP_Digest to create the SHA256 digest (hidden behind the BIO_f_md BIO usage)
BIO_f_base64 BIO usage to convert the digest into base64 format

There are lots of ways to do the same job using variations of the above OPENSSL API's depending on your situation.
Below is a C++ usage of the OpenSSL C API.  You can easily strip the C++ bits if required.
template<typename T, typename D>
std::unique_ptr<T, D> make_handle(T* handle, D deleter)
{
    return std::unique_ptr<T, D>{handle, deleter};
}

bool load_rsa_private_key_and_base64_sha256_hash_public_key()
{
    // load rsa private key in PEM format
    auto bio = make_handle(BIO_new_file(""privatekey.pem"", ""rb""), BIO_free);
    if(!bio) return false;
    auto const key = make_handle(PEM_read_bio_PrivateKey(bio.get(), nullptr, nullptr, (void*)(""password"")), EVP_PKEY_free);
    bio.reset();

    if(!key) return false;

    // extract private key from loaded certificate
    auto const rsa = EVP_PKEY_get0_RSA(key.get());
    if (!rsa) return false;

    auto const bmd = make_handle(BIO_new(BIO_f_md()), BIO_free);
    if(!bmd) return false;
    if (!BIO_set_md(bmd.get(), EVP_sha256())) return false;

    auto const null_bio = make_handle(BIO_new(BIO_s_null()), BIO_free);
    auto in = BIO_push(bmd.get(), null_bio.get());

    // write RSA Public Key into DER format to the SHA256 digest BIO chain
    i2d_RSA_PUBKEY_bio(in, rsa);

    // extract the SHA256 digest
    auto mdtmp = BIO_find_type(in, BIO_TYPE_MD);
    if (!mdtmp) return false;
    std::array<char, EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE> buffer;
    auto const length = BIO_gets(mdtmp, buffer.data(), buffer.size());

    if(length <= 0)  return false;

    // convert the digest to base64 and output to the stdio
    auto const b64 = make_handle(BIO_new(BIO_f_base64()), BIO_free);
    auto const bio_out = BIO_new_fp(stdout, BIO_NOCLOSE);
    auto out = BIO_push(b64.get(), bio_out);

Security is very important for me, as I cannot accept modified data, so I am thinking about adding a message diggest (signature) to check integrity... but is it needed having it over HTTPS?
","HTTPS already has sufficient signing to prevent accidental modifications.
A straight message digest with no secrets provides no protection against deliberate tampering. An active man-in-the-middle attacker could easily replace the digest with their own value, recalculated to match any alterations they made.
For a signature to have value against tampering it must have been created using a secret key on the sender, and the signature must be verifiable on the receiver, which means you must have a way to pre-exchange keys between parties before use.
For the case where the client is a general purpose web browser there is no channel to do that, other than transferring it over HTTPS at which point that interaction is just as vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and you gain nothing. This is a bootstrap problem.
For the case where you have a custom application client you have distributed to your users through a channel more trusted than HTTPS (eg you physically handing them copies of the code), then yes, adding a server-to-client signature based on public key crypto could theoretically provide some value. But rolling your own crypto is prone to implementation errors and best avoided.
What's the attack you're trying to counter here, that HTTPS together with the commercial CA infrastructure doesn't address well enough?
If your concern is that the PKI of commercial CAs is historically prone to occasional fraudulently-issued certificates and state-level spying, then a much simpler way of defending against that would be to run your own private CA for application use, and have your client accept only certs issued by that CA (and not the certificates built into the system like Verisign et al).
Whether through running a CA, or ad hoc signature checking, running your own PKI securely and effectively is a bunch of ongoing overhead. Be sure the public commercial PKI really can't meet your needs before going that route.

"57859621","Secure Communication Between Tomcat Servers","Note: this question was sort of asked here, but not answered.
I need to communicate securely between two Tomcat servers running in two different environments. I have control of both servers.
I would like to do this through a simple REST call from Server-B to Server-A.
On the server I am communicating to, Server-A, I can easily set up HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. If I import this certificate into the Java Keystore on Server-B, I can make a trusted HTTPS Rest call from my Java code on Server-B.
Good instructions for doing this can be found here:
https://blog.10pines.com/2017/09/25/how-to-communicate-via-https-between-two-tomcat-servers-using-a-self-signed-certificate/ 
I would also like to add a confirmation that the Rest call to Server-A is certainly coming from Server-B and the message has integrity.
My plan is to generate a self-signed certificate on Server-B and  import this certificate into the Java Keystore on Server-A. Then for any REST call from Server-B I will first generate an SHA-512 hash of the message and sign the hash with the private key associated with the Server-B certificate. When Server-A receives the message, the SHA-512 hash will be recalculated and checked for accuracy of the hash (no message tampering). I will then check the signature of the Hash against the public key of the certificate from Server-B.
For a little bit of extra paranoia I may encrypt the REST message with the public key of the certificate from Server-A; for short messages this should be fine (no need for Symmetric encryption).
Does this seem like a good plan? Does Tomcat have a simpler mechanism for doing this?
The Java Messaging API seems a little ""heavy"" for this use case.

"40706506","Connection between RC4 removal and SHA 1 removal","Is there any connection between the removal of RC4 stream cipher and SHA 1 certificate removal?
Meaning - did the removal of one force the other one to be removed or it just happened to be that they both have been removed at the same time?
","TL;DR: There is no such connection. The purpose of each of these algorithms is different, and they have no such effect on each other.
SHA1 is a cryptographic hash function, its purpose is to create a one way hash of the data in the certificate. There are several properties of cryptographic hash functions, the ones being important in this case are second pre-image resistance (given data1, it should be very difficult to find a different data2 such that h(data1)=h(data2)) and collision resistance (it should be very difficult to find data1 and data2 such that h(data1)=h(data2)).
If these requirements are not met in a hash function used for hashing certificates, one would be able to come up with a different certificate that has the same hash. That would be bad.
The problem with SHA1 is that it is easier to find a collision that it was supposed to be. To shed some ligh on the degree of the problem, it should be around 2^80 hashing operations (expected value) for a 160 bit hash function to find a collision. As opposed to that, for SHA1 it is around 2^63 according to an attack published in 2005. That is still a huge number and still practically infeasible, but people thought there may be a feasible attack in a few years, so it seemed better to just retire SHA1 now when people still have time to change certificates to a better hash function while SHA1 is still pratically secure.
RC4 is a stream cipher, it's input is a data stream and a key, the output is an encrypted stream. There have been known weaknesses for a long time, but those did not make it possible to actually break RC4 as it is used in SSL/TLS (attacks were not computationally feasible). Then in 2015, multiple researchers presented different attacks against RC4 (the Bar-mitzvah attack, the NOMORE attack, the improved Royal Holloway attack) that made it much more feasible to break RC4 in TLS in real life. Actually, most probably there are now organizations that can crack TLS if RC4 is used as the stream cipher, so it was removed based on the recommendation of IETF.

"46146031","Store user IP, but make it non traceable","I am working on a project where users (in a given and relativity short time period) answers statements, and i would like to store the entries anonymously.
After the collection period is over, i would like to be able to run statics on the answers. But it is very important that the users answers can not be traced back to a specific user/ip.
The reason that i would still like to store ip, regardless of my desire for the users to be anonymously, is that i would like to exclude entries where the user (with malicious intent or by accident), take the same test multiple times in a short span.
I have ruled out using encryptions, as it is, to my limited knowledge, not possible to compare a large set of encrypted strings like that.
My currently self proposed method is then to store: The user agent, a session identifier and a hashed ip address.
Regarding to the hashing method, i am thinking to use sha512 where the ip is prepended with a 16 character long salt (same salt for all entries). 
I know that when hashing simple and common strings, that sha512 and other hashing methods can be broken with tools like: http://md5decrypt.net/en/Sha512/ and good old brute forcing.
My idea to then guarantee user anonymity, is that after the collection period is over, i will delete the salt. Making it (to my knowledge) near impossible to brute force the hash. Even if a malicious party got hand on my source code.
I know it seems like a low tech solution, and that party of the security is based on my own action of actually deleting, where i en theory could forget or change my mind. But it is the only solution i could come up with.
Thanks in advance

","Your hash is actually calculating the same result each time, but you're calling toString on the resulting byte array. This returns a debug string, which is different for each instance (see this question for details).
Instead of 
return hashedPassword.toString();

You should 
return hashedPassword;

... and use the byte[] directly.
If you want to display the hash in a human readable format, you could print it like this:
String hashString = new BigInteger(1, hashedPassword).toString(16);
System.out.println(hashString);

There is a second mistake in your code. The forth argument to the PBEKeySpec constructor is the length in bits. 10 is way too short to be useful. You probably want 512 (the SHA512 output length).

"16698025","Getting back to an erroneous git reset","Say I'm working on a project and I'm making various commits as I go along
A - B - C - D - E
And I realise that I made a mistake and need to do git reset to go back to version C.
So I then carry on making commits like this: C - D2 - E2 - F2 - G2 etc.
Where D2 is different to D, E2 is different to E etc.
I then realise that I was right in the beginning, and I need to get back to E.
As long as I have kept a note of the SHA of version E, is this possible by doing git reset hjsdkgjdfg where hjsdkgjdfg is the hash of E? I've heard git 'cleans up' (deletes) loose ends every now and then - would D and E be classed as 'loose ends'? Does it depend on the type of reset I have done: soft, mixed, hard?
Bearing in mind I'm a beginner, is this the correct sort of workflow? Or is this a terrible way of working?
Thanks
","Yes, if you remember the hash you can get back to it.  You might want to use git checkout or git branch rather than git reset, though.  You're right that git cleans up occasionally - you'll see it when it happens, because you'll get some messages about ""garbage collecting.""
To be safe, you can keep a branch pointing at your old commit, and then you'll be able to access it symbolically rather than by remembering the hash.
If you need to find an old hash, but you don't remember it, git reflog can help you find it.  You can also do tricks like:
 git checkout @{yesterday.at.3.pm}

If you know roughly the time you want to go back to.

Why is it that I'm unable to obtain the SHA512 hash that I'm expecting?
","From https://docs.python.org/3/library/crypt.html:

This module implements an interface to the crypt(3) routine, which is a one-way hash function based upon a modified DES algorithm; see the Unix man page for further details. […]
Notice that the behavior of this module depends on the actual implementation of the crypt(3) routine in the running system. Therefore, any extensions available on the current implementation will also be available on this module.

and from the documentation of the function itself (emphasis mine):

The optional salt is either a string as returned from mksalt(), one of the crypt.METHOD_* values (though not all may be available on all platforms)

The crypt of the platform you’re on probably doesn’t support SHA-512. You can confirm this by checking whether crypt.METHOD_SHA512 is in crypt.methods.
>>> crypt.methods
[<crypt.METHOD_CRYPT>]
>>> ""\N{CRYING FACE}""

One could look at a description of SHAcrypt and make an implementation based on it, or use someone else’s.

Are there any ready solutions? Or maybe there's another way to use SHA-1 as PRNG in python? The quistion is asked because the code of SHA-1 PRNG in NIST tests confused me a bit.(the code is from NIST tests, it's in sts-2.1.2/sts-2.1.2/src/generators.c in the end). To be honest,I expected that SHA-1 PRNG works like this:

we have some starting value(let it be x), after that we do something like r=sha1(x)
now we have r as a new member of the pseudo-random sequence
and to have another member we do r=sha1(r)
But with that NIST code I really don't understand how to implement SHA-1 PRNG on python.

Our Patcher assembles a diff list of filepath changes between versions, and pairs them with a generated Sha sum to save to a JSON. The source files are being stored on a local server on the network that all build machines can access. Currently, our Windows build machine is assembling the filepaths and Sha hashes for both Windows and OSX builds due to it being much faster than our OSX build machine, and then passes off the JSON information to the OSX build machine to complete the process.
When uploading files from OSX to AWS using the following commands using the following libraries, we are seeing that the resulting SHA's generated after subsequent download no longer matches the original file that operations were being done on. Does anyone know what's happening here or what commands are messing up? We are only seeing this on OSX, whereas the exact same code is being run on windows with no issue. 
The Sha generation method we're using on both Patcher and Client is from Node's native crypto library.
https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html
Our Patcher upload to S3 is using the uploadFile function of:
https://github.com/andrewrk/node-s3-client
While Client Download is using Electron's internal downloader:
https://electronjs.org/docs/api/download-item
For Client-side file moving, we're using:
https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra
In this fashion:
fs.copySync(cpFROM, cpTO, { overwrite: true, preserveTimestamps: true })
fs.removeSync(cpFROM);

I tried using the move operations, but that resulted in crashes on OSX.

","SHA-1 is a one way hash function... though it should not be used in most of the cases but in your case since you are using it for WeChat you have no other option but to use it , unless WeChat modifies there implementation.
Also to answer your other question , which is when HTTPS encrypts your request , so HTTPS is a protocol which insures that the data in motion is secured and encrypted.
When a browser attempts to access a website that is secured by SSL, the browser and the web server establish an SSL connection using a process called an “SSL Handshake” (see diagram below). Note that the SSL Handshake is invisible to the user and happens instantaneously.

Essentially, three keys are used to set up the SSL connection: the public, private, and session keys. Anything encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key, and vice versa.
Because encrypting and decrypting with private and public key takes a lot of processing power, they are only used during the SSL Handshake to create a symmetric session key. After the secure connection is made, the session key is used to encrypt all transmitted data.

How could I get a shasum or equivalent of my hardware + operating system. 

You don't define what that means:
Should that hash change if you add some RAM, or some SD card, or some USB device, in your system?
Should that hash change if you replace the hardware by some identical one (e.g. one RaspberryPi burned, and you replace it with another one with the same SD card)? Or by a similar hardware faking to be the original one?
Should that hash change if you (or some adversary) make a minor upgrade of your OS kernel, or if you add some additional package or program in your system?
Should that hash change if you make some minor configuration (e.g. change some configuration file under /etc/, assuming some Linux-like system)?
Notice that on many systems, you can change the MAC address by some software tricks (I don't know if that applies to your RaspberryPi).
So I think that there is no failproof solution to your question.
(in other words, with enough efforts and skills, you can always fake some existing system; you might want that to be difficult enough to be not worth the effort, but that makes a different question; is your typical adversary as powerful as the NSA, or do you just care about a teenager hacker?).
BTW /proc/cpuinfo (see proc(5)) could change with a kernel upgrade, and can be faked quite simply (to stay the same) by some kernel patch even after a hardware change.

I have build a FIPS capable openssl library. 
Openssl Version 1.0.2t and FIPS object module 2.0.16.
I was reading the user guide for FIPS object module which told that the last step in building a program with FIPS capable openssl was to use fipsld to link my program with openssl rather than gcc/ld as it computes sha1sum of fipscansiter.o using fipsprelim.c.
After this I need to call FIPS_mode_set(1) which enables fips mode. 
This works if I am generating a executable. But in my project we provide a static library to our customers and we resolve all dependencies at our end, so we unpack libcrypto.a using ar x libcrypto.a and add all the openssl object files to our static library libapi.a.
There is one class(API_DigitalSignature.cpp) which is build as a wrapper around openssl api for digital signature. 

Now the problem is I am confused on how should I use fipsld in my project because I am not generating a program but rather just an archive?
Also I clarified with some security persons that unpacking libcrypto.a doesn't  affect FIPS validation unless we are changing any ciphers.

"41283317","Is it better to hash individual parts instead of hashing hashes of the individual part?","I have several byte arrays from which I have to calculate the SHA hash. Something like this:
(b1, b2, ..., bn) -> SHA hash

If I know instead hash the individual byte arrays and then calculate the SHA hash from this, does this have the same ""security"", or chance of a collision?
b1 -> H1,
b2 -> H2
(H1, H2) -> Final Hash

Or simpler asked: Which method is ""better""? **

"58499287","Create a sha1 signature with sha2 (256) certificate. It's possible. Why?","I am currently working on improving the signing of our .NET applications. So far I have always created a sha1 signature. Now I want to create an additional sha2 (256) signature. I stumbled across this article:
https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/code-signing-dual-signing-sha256-sha1.htm
There is talk about the fact that you need a corresponding certificate of the same type for the sha1 or sha2 signing.
So I checked my certificate and saw that it was issued with the ""Signature hash algorithm"" sha256.
But with this certificate I always created sha1 signatures for our .NET applications without any problems (with signtool.exe).
My question: Why can I create a sha1 signature with a sha256 certificate and is that a problem? Would it be better to use a sha1 certiifkat (I could download one from my certification authority)?

","The number defines number of bytes, not characters
£ in UTF-8 is 2-byte wide (0xc2 0xa3), thus:
printf ""blob 6\0hola£"" | shasum is what you want
which returns 8f9852933655612593d0bbd43c9f7c6f25d947a0 as expected.
Check yourself:
Unpack the content of the just written object:

"46569866","how to keep all files by unduplicating them","This is a bit of an odd request as its not necessarily coding related, but I have been using SHA256 to spot duplicate files. Unfortunately for one reason or another all duplicate files need to be kept and need to be amended slightly for a new SHA256 to be generated.
There are many solutions out there that will delete duplicate files etc, but I need a solution that will look for duplicates and as it finds a duplicate, try to unduplicate it.
As I am using pdf, doc and docx files, I was thinking of a solution that adds a blank page at the end of the document with a character. I have been doing this currently manually but something automated would be of much help.
Has anyone come across this issue or know of a possible solution?
Thank you for your help in advance,
Panos

66840dda154e8a113c31dd0ad32f7f3a366a80e8136979d8f5a101d3d29d6f72

I than used the Web Crypto API (crypto.subtle.digest()) to calculate the hash. I'm using the ArrayBuffer from the Uint8Array here. Still OK, calculates the same hash:
let data = new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]);
const digest = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', data.buffer);
const array = Array.from(new Uint8Array(digest));
const hex = array.map(byte => ('00' + byte.toString(16)).slice(-2)).join('');
// 66840dda154e8a113c31dd0ad32f7f3a366a80e8136979d8f5a101d3d29d6f72

Now I want to use Forge library to calculate the hash and I can't get it to produce the correct hash:
let data = new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]);
const md = forge.md.sha256.create();
md.update(data);
let hex = md.digest().toHex();
// 181e2276640163cbb29a50fa846412edb6489b3c73e82ca4b64ae114b752a542

let data = new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]);
const md = forge.md.sha256.create();
let buffer = forge.util.createBuffer(data);
md.update(buffer);
let hex = md.digest().toHex();
// 1d4e1124c22199ab44fc3acb57e2f68f18bee390d8a52d62b15c23d3fc157846

","Ok, I found the solution in an issue on Github:
