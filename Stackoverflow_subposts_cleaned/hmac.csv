Remember to use -n with echo or else a line break character is appended to the string and that changes your data and the hash.
That command comes from the OpenSSL package which should already be installed (or easily installed) in your choice of Linux/Unix, Cygwin and the likes.
Do note that older versions of openssl (such as that shipped with RHEL4) may not provide the -hmac option.

As an alternative solution, but mainly to prove that the results are the same, we can also call PHP's hmac_sha1() from the command line:
[me@home]$ echo '<?= hash_hmac(""sha1"", ""value"", ""key"") ?>' | php

","Thanks for the hash_hmac function! But it was not enough for my application. In case anyone wondered, I had to re-hash stuff several times using a key that was the result of the previous hashing, and therefore is a binary input. (The Amazon AWS authentication signature is created like this.)
So what I needed was a way to supply the binary key in some way that would not break the algorithm. Then I found this: http://openssl.6102.n7.nabble.com/command-line-hmac-with-key-in-hex-td6754.html
Stephen Henson's reply requires the hash_hmac function to return the value in hex format. So it needs to echo the following:
$ echo -n ""$data"" | openssl dgst ""-$digest"" -hmac ""$key"" | sed -e 's/^.* //'

Then the next call would need to provide the key as an hexit:
$ echo -n ""$data"" | openssl dgst ""-$digest"" -mac HMAC -macopt ""hexkey:$key"" | sed -e 's/^.* //'

Hopefully this helps anyone, probably someone who is trying to create bash scripts to invalidate CloudFront entries on AWS (like me!) (I haven't tested it yet, but I think this is the thing that is the cause of why my bash script does not work, and my PHP one does...)

","here is how you can generate HMAC-SHA1 base64.
You need to add Base64.h and Base64.m to your project. You can get it from here.
If you use ARC, it will show some errors in Base64.m. Find the lines who are similar like this
return [[[self alloc] initWithBase64String:base64String] autorelease];

what you need is to delete the autorelease section. The final result should look like:
return [[self alloc] initWithBase64String:base64String];

","Out of interest, why do you create (unsigned char cHMAC) and then convert into (NSData) and then convert it into (NSMutableString) and then convert finally into (HexString)?
You could do this in a quicker way by cutting the middleman (i.e. without NSData and NSMutableString altogether, quicker and better performance), also changing (unsigned char) into (uint8_t []), after all they are all hex-arrays anyway!, below:
-(NSString *)hmac:(NSString *)plaintext withKey:(NSString *)key

","an extension to Vimvq1987's answer:
return hashValue.ToString(); doesn't produce the output you want/need. You have to convert the bytes in the array hashValue to their hex-string representation.
Can be as simple as return BitConverter.toString(hashValue); (prints upper-case letters A-F) or if you like it a bit more complex:
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.IO;

namespace ConsoleApplication1
{
    class Program
    {

            }

","A minor thing but if you are looking for an equivalent to hmac(key,message) then by default the python library will use the MD5 algorithm, so you need to use the HmacMD5 algorithm in Java.
I mention this because I had this exact problem and found this answer which was helpful, but I missed the part where a digest method was passed in to hmac() and thus went down a rabbit hole. Hopefully this answer will prevent others doing the same in the future.
e.g. in Python REPL
>>> import hmac
>>> hmac.new(""keyValueGoesHere"", ""secretMessageToHash"").hexdigest()
'1a7bb3687962c9e26b2d4c2b833b2bf2'

This is equivalent to the Java method:
import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Hex;
import javax.crypto.Mac;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

public class HashingUtility {
    public static String HMAC_MD5_encode(String key, String message) throws Exception {

        byte[] rawHmac = mac.doFinal(message.getBytes());

        return Hex.encodeHexString(rawHmac);

","There is no way to send a password securely that the user can verify without SSL.
Sure, you can write some JavaScript that will make a password secure for over-the-wire transmission through hashing or public-key-encryption. But how can the user be sure that the JavaScript itself has not been tampered with by a man-in-the-middle before it reached them, to send the password to an attacker instead of the site, or even just compromise the security of the algorithm? The only way would be for them to be expert programmers and have them inspect every line of your page and script to ensure it was kosher before typing the password. That is not a realistic scenario.
If you want passwords to be safe from man-in-the-middle attacks, you must buy an SSL cert. There is no other way. Get used to it.

If I use MD5, one can reverse that password string.

No... not trivially at least. Whilst MD5 has attacks against it, it's a hashing algorithm and thus unreversable. You would have to brute-force it.
But again, a man-in-the-middle attacker doesn't need to look at your MD5s. He can simply sabotage the JavaScript you send the user to make the MD5s.

","The solution requires the client to be able to encrypt the password using a secret encryption key known only to the client and the server.
SSL accomplishes this by requiring both the server and the client web browser to have their own asymmetric public/private keypair, which they use to encrypt and transmit a random session key between them. The rest of the conversation then uses that secure session key.
So you're asking how to solve the same problem as SSL without the benefit of having a secret key that is known only to the client and server. I'm no expert, but it looks like this can't be done, or at least not easily.

","If you don't have access to SSL, MD5 should be adequate to prevent accidental discovery of passwords (such as in a network log file or something). Anything else would be a waste of time. Just make sure the app doesn't give access to sensitive information (ie, credit card numbers, medical history, etc).
Like others commenters have suggested, a serious attacker will be able to break any type of security on the page.

In the original form include a large block of random text along with a key.  Store the original random text in the session based on key on the server.

On the server, use the key to lookup the original random text, perform the same hashing operation with the stored password. If the server-hashed value matches the client hashed value, then you know the client entered the right password without ever sending the password to the server.
Whether the password is right or not, expire the key and random text so each are one-time-use.

i think in something, but i don't know if it could be really secure. If you can put your form in a php file, then you can create an algoritm for create a string based in time or in something else, and then put this string in your html.
When the user type a password in a password input field, when you debug it you canot see the value typed by user, so before send the information via post or get, you can use the password user as a hint to encrypt the encrypted string previosly generated, and then, just sent it insted of the password typed by user.
In this way, the attackers dont have all inside the js code, so they will need discover the algoritm that you create to decrypt it.
This is just an idea, so if you can tell me how this can not be safe, I would appreciate it.

Se me acaba de ocurrir algo que puede servir, pero no se si realmente sea algo seguro. Por medio de php puedes generar un algoritmo que cree un string en base al timestamp o algo más, y después colocar esta cadena en el html.
Note que cuando alguien escribe una contraseña en un campo input tipo password, con un debug no se puede ver el valor que tecleo el usuario (no se si exista manera pero no quise investigar más), asi que podemos utilizar la contraseña que el usuario escribió como palabra clave para encriptar la cadena de texto que previamente habiamos generado con php, por medio de un algoritmo en JS. Sería algo así como encriptar lo encriptado. Posteriormente lo que estariamos enviado no sería la contraseña tecleada, si no esta última cadena resultante.
Buscando un contra, lo único que se me ocurra es que el atacante tendrá que dedicarle mucho tiempo para tratar de encontrar el agoritmo que creamos por medio de php y poder decriptar la cadena final, o tendrá que hackear el servidor para acceder al php y obtener el algoritmo.
Esto es solo una idea, por lo que si pueden decirme como esto puede no ser seguro, se los agradecería.

","As mentioned, none of this is secure against server spoofing, as that requires an ability to trust the client-side Javascript. But if we're sure that the server can't be spoofed (signed cert, hash signing immune to length-extension, etc.) but not that the connection is immune to eavesdroppers, here's how I'd implement it.
I think the most secure way is, instead of storing H(password), where H is your hash function of choice, store g^H(password) i.e. use the password as the private key for Diffie-Hellman key exchange. (You should also probably use a random g for different users, too--it becomes your salt.) Then to verify, you generate a nonce b, send the user g^b, and compute (g^H(password))^b. The user does not need to know g--they need only compute (g^b)^H(password) = (g^H(password))^b. Now you have a number that both parties know iff the user entered the right password, and constructing a challenge-response zero-knowledge proof based on knowing the correct number is trivial, while the random number used as the server's ""private key"" makes the approach immune to replay attacks.

The value for oauth_signature is what we would like to calculate.
The following defines what we want to sign:
# There is no query string present.
# In case of http://example.org/api?a=1&b=2 - the value
# would be ""a=1&b=2"".
uri_query=""""

# The oauthlib function 'collect_parameters' automatically
# ignores irrelevant header items like 'Content-Type' or

"3696857","What's the difference between Message Digest, Message Authentication Code, and HMAC?","My understanding of a message digest is that it's an encrypted hash of some data sent along with the encrypted data so you may verify that the data has not been tampered with. What is the difference then between this and message authentication codes (MAC) and hash MACs (HMAC)?
","
A message digest algorithm takes a single input -- a message -- and produces a ""message digest"" (aka hash) which allows you to verify the integrity of the message: Any change to the message will (ideally) result in a different hash being generated. An attacker that can replace the message and digest is fully capable of replacing the message and digest with a new valid pair.
A MAC algorithm takes two inputs -- a message and a secret key -- and produces a MAC which allows you to verify the integrity and the authenticity of the message: Any change to the message or the secret key will (ideally) result in a different MAC being generated. Nobody without access to the secret should be able to generate a MAC calculation that verifies; in other words a MAC can be used to check that the MAC was generated by a party that has access to the secret key.
A HMAC algorithm is simply a specific type of MAC algorithm that uses a hash algorithm internally (rather than, for example, an encryption algorithm) to generate the MAC.

","The Wikipedia article on HMAC gives a good explanation of this.
In the Security section of the same article it goes on to say:

HMACs are substantially less affected by collisions than their underlying hashing algorithms alone.

So adding an HMAC to an MD5 hash would make it substantially more difficult to break via a rainbow table.

","HMAC is not susceptible to length extension attacks.
md5(T + K) should be fine for most uses unless your adversary is motivated to tamper with your message and has very good computing power. As long as you control T, birthday attacks are not applicable and you only have brute-force attacks. But it is good to be aware of the limitations. If you want to go with this approach you may want use SHA1(T + K) instead of MD5.
md5(T+K) is certainly better than md5(K+T) where an attacker may append text to your message and generate another valid MAC.
With md5(T+K), the issue is that if an attacker can find a collision with T2 such that md5(T) = md5(T2), then md5(T+K) = md5(T2+K). But this requires a brute-force attack.
Note: I say ""as long as you control T"", because if changes can be made to T (in such a way that it is not obvious) one can try to generate 2 messages T1 and T2 where T1 can pass for T and md5(T1) = md5(T2). Now this is relatively lot easier to do (we are talking 2^64 instead of 2^128) and the reason is the so-called Birthday paradox or Birthday attack.
Note: The design of HMAC was motivated to avoid these kinds of extension attacks. There are no known attacks against HMAC.

ipad be the inner padding  (0x363636…3636, one-block-long hexadecimal
constant)
Then HMAC(K,m)  is mathematically defined by 

HMAC(K,m) = H((K ⊕ opad)    ∥ H((K ⊕ ipad)    ∥ m)).

blocksized is determined by your hash function (MD5 would be 64
bytes)
o_key_pad = [opad * blocksize] ⊕ key
i_key_pad = [ipad * blocksize] ⊕ key

Your result would be:
H(o_key_pad || H(i_key_pad || TEXT))

You can find a good read here:
http://timdinh.nl/index.php/hmac/
With also the following pseudocode which almost looks like mine :
function hmac (key, message)
    opad = [0x5c * blocksize] // Where blocksize is that of the underlying hash function
    ipad = [0x36 * blocksize]

    if (length(key) > blocksize) then
        key = hash(key) // Where 'hash' is the underlying hash function
    end if

    for i from 0 to length(key) - 1 step 1
        ipad[i] = ipad[i] XOR key[i]
        opad[i] = opad[i] XOR key[i]
    end for

    return hash(opad || hash(ipad || message)) // Where || is concatenation
end function

"8363315","How to implement HMAC Authentication in a RESTful WCF API","We are building a RESTful API using WCF (currently .Net 3.5, but will be moving to .Net 4 soon).  We have a functional framework in place, but it is currently unsecured.  It will need to be accessible from .Net applications as well as iOS, Android, and web applications.
We would like to use an HMAC Authentication scheme as described here and here, but both examples seem to fall apart when describing how to validate the hash.  The first example fails to describe the UserKeys object (hashtable?) and the second example is missing the GetUserKey methods on the client- and server-side.
Can anyone provide an explanation of how the ""User Key""/token is generated/stored/retrieved/used in those examples or provide a better example (with source code, if possible) of how to use HMAC Authorization in a RESTful WCF service?
Edit:
After more research, we determined that we needed more of an ""Authorization"" technique rather than an ""Authentication"" technique (semantics?).  We implemented Basic Authorization and secured the API behind SSL.  The Basic Authorization uses the same ""Authorization"" header from the web Request as the HMAC Authentication scheme, but passes a username:password string encoded in Base64 instead of a token.  This allowed us to custom-validate a user against our database to determine if the user is licensed for and has appropriate security rights to access the desired API method.
We're certainly open to hearing other options on how to accomplish custom username/password validation and other methods for securing the API.
","Retrieving the user key is just an implementation detail you can do any way you like but on the server it is often stored in a database along with the user name.
The basic approach is real simple.

Somehow the server and the client exchange a shared key for the user to use. This can be done any way you like, including sending an old fashioned dead tree style letter. Quite often this is just the password the user entered. 
When the client wants to send a request he builds the complete request and then using the secret key computes a hash over the complete message body (and optionally some of the message headers if required)
Next the client add the computed hash and his username to the message in one of the headers and sends it to the service.
The service retrieves the username from the message header and searches the private keu for that user in its own database.
Next he computes the hash over the message body (and selected headers) using the key to generate its hash.
If the hash the client sends matches the hash the server computes the server knows the message was send by the real client and was not altered in any way.

Really the only tricky part is sharing a secret key with the user and keeping that secure. That is why some services allow for generation of shared keys with a limited life time so you can give the key to a third party to temporarily work on your behalf.

","Those hashes are not ASCII–the reason you see hex digits is because the software you use to generate them takes the binary output of the digest and turns it into an ASCII string of hex digits.
For instance, the MD5 digest will fill an array of 16 bytes. You can also represent it as a string of 32 characters, but the most basic form of the digest is still the array of bytes.
When you change an array of bytes into a hex string, you need 8 bits (one full character) to represent every 4 bits of data. Although it's not frequently called that way, you could say that this uses ""base16"" encoding, since you're grabbing 4 bits at a time and mapping them to a 16-character alphabet.
Base64, on the other hand, grabs 6 bits at a time and maps them to a 64-character alphabet. This means that you need 8 bits (again, one full character) to represent every 6 bits of data, which has half the wasted bits of base16. A base16-encoded string will always be twice as big as the original; a base64-encoded string will only be four thirds as big. For a SHA256 hash, base16 does 64 bytes, but base64 does approximately 43.

I found this out the hard way when my own application had my AWS key disabled in a production app.  I had read the TOS, but it was not really there as you can see by the link above to some other obscure detail of use.  You wouldn't think the affiliate program would have anything to do with the API, but it does.
You can find details of other apps blocked at this TechCrunch article:

or have I misunderstood?
","This is because hmac uses the provided key to generate a salt and make the hash more strong, while hashlib only hashes the provided message.
By looking at the hmac module source code, you will find how to achieve the same behaviour as hmac using the hashlib module, here the used algorithm (it's not the original one, i stripped some checkings to have just the interesting part):
import hashlib

MESSAGE = ""msg""
KEY = ""key""

trans_5C = """".join ([chr (x ^ 0x5C) for x in xrange(256)])
trans_36 = """".join ([chr (x ^ 0x36) for x in xrange(256)])

outer = hashlib.sha256()
inner = hashlib.sha256()

KEY = KEY + chr(0) * (inner.block_size - len(KEY))

outer.update(KEY.translate(trans_5C))
inner.update(KEY.translate(trans_36))
inner.update(MESSAGE)
outer.update(inner.digest())

result = outer.hexdigest()
print result # prints 2d93cbc1be167bcb1637a4a23cbff01a7878f0c50ee833954ea5221bb1b8c628

The same directly using hmac:
import hashlib
import hmac

result = hmac.new(KEY, MESSAGE, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
print result # prints 2d93cbc1be167bcb1637a4a23cbff01a7878f0c50ee833954ea5221bb1b8c628

So when using hmac, it doesn't only hashes the given message using the specified hashing algorithm, it also uses the key to complexify the hash.

Excuse the pseudo code.
1) How is the input to the first instance of the SHA1 function formatted?
SHA1(""network_name""+""network_name_length""+""network_password"")
Is it formatted in that order, is it the hex value of the network name, length and password or straight ASCII?
Then from what I gather the 160 bit digest received is fed straight into another round of hashing without any additional salting.  Like this: SHA1(""160bit digest from last round of hashing"") Rise and repeat.
2) Once this occurs 4096 times 256 bits of the output is used as the pairwise master key.  What I don't understand is that if SHA1 produces 160bit output, how does the algorithm arrive at the 256bits required for a key?
Thanks for the help.
","yeah thats right, the algorithm to generate a binary key for a WPA network is:
key = PBKDF2(passphrase, ssid, 4096, 256)
PBKDF2 is described in http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2898.txt
It uses the HMAC algorithm to create a digest of the input. HMAC can use any hash function, here the spec calls for SHA1 as you mentioned. The hash is done on an intermediate state within the HMAC algorithm:
H(K XOR opad, H(K XOR ipad, text))

(H=the chosen hash function, K is the passphrase, text would be ssid)
This HMAC process is repeated 4096 times by PBKDF2.
HMAC algorithm: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2104
There's a source example here of deriving a key:

The server then authenticates the client by using that client's secret key to repeat the signature process itself and compare the result to the signature transmitted by the client.
This is all nice and good but it means the the server requires access to the plaintext of the client's shared secret. That flies in the face of all the advice out there against storing user passwords in the clear inside your database. Storing only the salted hash of the password is not an option as far as I can tell - because then I can't verify the client's signature.
I should stress that my API is RESTful and thus should be stateless: I'd rather avoid a login step prior to other API calls.
One optional solution is to encrypt all user passwords using some symmetric key algorithm. However, the server would have to store the key to that encryption somewhere easily accessible, e.g. inside the source code. This is better than nothing but not an optimal solution (as @Rook mentioned in his answer, it violates CWE-257).
Another direction for a solution could be something around asymmetric signatures, but I can't figure out how to apply that to the HMAC, and can't find any articles on the subject.

","This is the downside of symmetric-key challenge-response style authentication - you don't put the secret on the wire, but you have to store the secret at both ends.  (HMACs are symmetric key systems).
Note though that it's not a password - it's a shared secret.  There's a fundamental difference here - a password is generally chosen by the user, whereas a shared secret is generated randomly and provided to the user (they're often called ""API keys"", in this context).
Storing passwords in a reversible format is bad, because if your database is compromised, then the attackers have obtained passwords that might (and probably have been) used elsewhere.  Storing a shared secret, on the other hand, is not such a problem - the secret it's specific to your service, so all the attackers have gained is the ability to log in to your service.
On the other hand, it is possible to have an asymmetric system that doesn't have to store a secret at the server side.  The basic idea is that the server knows the client's public key and current message sequence number.  When sending an API request, the client increments the message sequence number and calculates a signature over the sequence number and the API request parameters, which the server can verify using the public key.  The server rejects a message if it contains an old message sequence number, to prevent replay attacks.

If not, are there any best practices that you can share?
","I am not sure if i am missing something here but one option is to use  hashed password as symmetric key.

The steps that was mentioned is as follows:

Use the FIN message input as a binary value (unsigned char in C language, byte in Java). The FIN message input must be coded in the ASCII character set.
Combine the left LAU key and the right LAU key as one string. The merged LAU key must be used as a binary value (unsigned char in C language, byte in Java). The merged LAU key must be coded in the ASCII character set.
Call a HMAC256 routine to compute the hash value. The hash value must also be treated as a binary value (unsigned char in C language, byte in Java). The hmac size is 32 bytes.
Convert the hmac binary values to uppercase hexadecimal printable characters (for example, a onebyte binary value of 0000 1010 has a hexadecimal value of 0x0A and will be translated to the twobyte characters “0A”).

","Yes, OAuth2 is a pretty standard protocol for securing resources and I would recommend it instead of rolling custom implementations.

","The token based approach used in OAuth2 and OpenIdentity is very wide spread and enables a wide range of scenarios (Web Apps, Mobile, Deskop Apps, microservices).
There are some good libraries out there for providing and consuming tokens. They should be preferred over implementing your own protocols. Later approach is more error prone and is more difficult to be consumed by other clients (if there is the need in the future). I recommend to have a look in the IdentityServer (it is OpenSource).

","My favourite answer - I would use the OpenSSL libraries, the HMAC function.
I've successfully used the OpenSSL libraries in Delphi by adopting and adapting work from M Ferrante http://www.disi.unige.it/person/FerranteM/delphiopenssl/
For other OpenSSL signing etc see this link

In D2010 it's something like this (libeay32 is the unit taken from the web site and slightly modified for unicode/D2010):
uses libeay32;

const
  LIBEAY_DLL_NAME = 'libeay32.dll';
  EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE = 64;

function EVP_sha256: pEVP_MD; cdecl; external LIBEAY_DLL_NAME;
function HMAC(evp: pEVP_MD; key: PByte; key_len: integer; 
              data: PByte; data_len: integer; 
              md: PByte; var md_len: integer): PByte; cdecl; external LIBEAY_DLL_NAME;

function GetHMAC(const AKey, AData: string): TBytes;
var
  key, data: TBytes;
  md_len: integer;
  res: PByte;
begin
  OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms;
  // Seed the pseudo-random number generator
  // This should be something a little more ""random""!
  RAND_load_file('c:\windows\paint.exe', 512);

  key := TEncoding.UTF8.GetBytes(AKey);
  data := TEncoding.UTF8.GetBytes(AData);
  md_len := EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE;
  SetLength(result, md_len);
  res := HMAC(EVP_sha256, @key[0], Length(key), @data[0], Length(data), @result[0], md_len);
  if (res <> nil) then
  begin
    SetLength(result, md_len);
  end;
end;

Then call it with a key phrase and data string. The result is a TBytes which can be converted as required eg to Base64 using something like JclMime or a simple HexToString type function.
For older version of Delphi you'll have to do a bit of changing of PBytes to PChars or something similar.

","Define 'not working'. Exception? Output not as expected?, etc.
One obvious thing is that you are processing the same data twice:
mac.update(sData.getBytes());
bytes = mac.doFinal(sData.getBytes());

To process all data in one pass, just use doFinal() (assuming it's not too big).
Another thing that can be wrong is the format of the key: what is the format of String sKey. Ideally you should be using a BASE64 encoded string, not calls to getString().

I'm just not sure how to go from that, to 6 digits as proposed in the above algorithms.
","You have two issues here:

If you are generating alpha-numeric, you are not conforming to the RFC - at this point, you can simply take any N bytes and turn them to a hex string and get alpha-numeric.  Or, convert them to base 36 if you want a-z and 0-9.  Section 5.4 of the RFC is giving you the standard HOTP calc for a set Digit parameter (notice that Digit is a parameter along with C, K, and T).   If you are choosing to ignore this section, then you don't need to convert the code - just use what you want.
Your ""result"" byte array has the expiration time simply stuffed in the first 8 bytes after hashing.  If your truncation to 6-digit alphanumeric does not collect these along with parts of the hash, it may as well not be calculated at all.  It is also very easy to ""fake"" or replay - hash the secret once, then put whatever ticks you want in front of it - not really a one time password.  Note that parameter C in the RFC is meant to fulfill the expiring window and should be added to the input prior to computing the hash code.

","For anyone interested, I did figure out a way to build expiration into my one time password.  The approach is to use the created time down to the minute (ignoring seconds, milliseconds, etc).  Once you have that value, use the ticks of the DateTime as your counter, or variable C.
otpLifespan is my HOTP lifespan in minutes.
DateTime current = new DateTime(DateTime.Now.Year, DateTime.Now.Month, 
    DateTime.Now.Day, DateTime.Now.Hour, DateTime.Now.Minute, 0);

for (int x = 0; x <= otpLifespan; x++)
{
    var result = NumericHOTP.Validate(hotp, key, 
        current.AddMinutes(-1 * x).Ticks);

    //return valid state if validation succeeded

    //return invalid state if the passed in value is invalid 
    //  (length, non-numeric, checksum invalid)
}

//return expired state

My expiring HOTP extends from my numeric HOTP which has a static validation method that checks the length, ensures it is numeric, validates the checksum if it is used, and finally compares the hotp passed in with a generated one.
The only downside to this is that each time you validate an expiring hotp, your worse case scenario is to check n + 1 HOTP values where n is the lifespan in minutes.
The java code example in the document outlining RFC 4226 was a very straightforward move into C#.  The only piece I really had to put any effort into rewriting was the hashing method.
private static byte[] HashHMACSHA1(byte[] keyBytes, byte[] text)
{
    HMAC alg = new HMACSHA1(keyBytes);

    return alg.ComputeHash(text);
}

"4308003","HMAC-based one time password in C# (RFC 4226 - HOTP)","I am attempting to wrap my brain around generating a 6 digit/character non case sensitive expiring one-time password.
My source is http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226#section-5
First the definition of the parameters
C       8-byte counter value, the moving factor.  This counter
       MUST be synchronized between the HOTP generator (client)
       and the HOTP validator (server).

K       shared secret between client and server; each HOTP
       generator has a different and unique secret K.

T       throttling parameter: the server will refuse connections
       from a user after T unsuccessful authentication attempts.

Then we have the algorithm to generate the HOTP
As the output of the HMAC-SHA-1 calculation is 160 bits, we must
   truncate this value to something that can be easily entered by a
   user.

                   HOTP(K,C) = Truncate(HMAC-SHA-1(K,C))

Then, we have Truncate defined as
String = String[0]...String[19]
 Let OffsetBits be the low-order 4 bits of String[19]
 Offset = StToNum(OffsetBits) // 0 <= OffSet <= 15
 Let P = String[OffSet]...String[OffSet+3]
 Return the Last 31 bits of P

And then an example is offered for a 6 digit HOTP
The following code example describes the extraction of a dynamic
binary code given that hmac_result is a byte array with the HMAC-
SHA-1 result:

    int offset   =  hmac_result[19] & 0xf ;
    int bin_code = (hmac_result[offset]  & 0x7f) << 24
       | (hmac_result[offset+1] & 0xff) << 16
       | (hmac_result[offset+2] & 0xff) <<  8
       | (hmac_result[offset+3] & 0xff) ;

I am rather at a loss in attempting to convert this into useful C# code for generating one time passwords.  I already have code for creating an expiring HMAC as follows:
byte[] hashBytes = alg.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(input));
byte[] result = new byte[8 + hashBytes.Length];

hashBytes.CopyTo(result, 8);
BitConverter.GetBytes(expireDate.Ticks).CopyTo(result, 0);

I'm just not sure how to go from that, to 6 digits as proposed in the above algorithms.

"18687926","Verifying hmac sha1 signature in Java","I'd like to know how I could verify the signature I created. My code to create a signature  looks similar to this one: HMAC-SHA1: How to do it properly in Java?
I send the message, the signature and the public key to verify the signature. Public and private key are generated using KeyPairGenerator. How can I use the public key I have to verify my signature? Or maybe can you suggest any good libraries for Java for signing and verifying signature that use HMAC SHA1?
","First to clarify, the HMAC code does not generate a signature.  It is a type of Message Authentication Code (MAC).
The latter link explains the difference between a signature and a MAC this way:

MACs differ from digital signatures as MAC values are both generated
  and verified using the same secret key. This implies that the sender
  and receiver of a message must agree on the same key before initiating
  communications, as is the case with symmetric encryption. For the same
  reason, MACs do not provide the property of non-repudiation offered by
  signatures specifically in the case of a network-wide shared secret
  key: any user who can verify a MAC is also capable of generating MACs
  for other messages. In contrast, a digital signature is generated
  using the private key of a key pair, which is asymmetric encryption.
  Since this private key is only accessible to its holder, a digital
  signature proves that a document was signed by none other than that
  holder. Thus, digital signatures do offer non-repudiation. However,
  non-repudiation can be provided by systems that securely bind key
  usage information to the MAC key; the same key is in possession of two
  people, but one has a copy of the key that can be used for MAC
  generation while the other has a copy of the key in a hardware
  security module that only permits MAC verification. This is commonly
  done in the finance industry.

So in order to verify an HMAC, you need to share the key that was used to generate it.  You would send the message, the HMAC, and the receiver would have the same key you used to generate the HMAC.  They could then use the same algorithm to generate an HMAC from your message, and it should match the HMAC you sent.  Public/private keys (assymetric) are not used for this.  You need to generate a symmetric key (like AES) and securely share that with the people that will be generating/verifying the HMAC.
This limits the HMAC to having integrity and authenticity properties only, and not non-repudiation.  
The quote above mentioned that hardware security modules could be used to enforce the key use, and then you could get non-repudiation as long as only one person could use the key for generating the HMAC.
Alternatively, you could use a hybrid approach.  Use a shared symmetric key to generate the HMAC.  The HMAC in the end is a hash.  You could then sign this hash with your private key (different than the key used in the HMAC).  A third party with the symmetric key and your public key could verify you signed the HMAC, and could generate their own HMAC with the message and the shared key to make sure it matched.  This would also give you non-repudiation.
If you want to go this route, use the Java Signature class.  The HMAC algorithm is SHA-1, and assuming your keypair is RSA, you could use the NONEwithRSA Signature algorithm since the input is already a SHA-1 hash.  Or you could hash it again with the SHA1withRSA algorithm.  As long as you generate the signature and verify with the same algorithm, it should be OK.
    byte[] data = hmac.getBytes(""UTF-8"");

    Signature mySig = Signature.getInstance(""NONEwithRSA"");

    mySig.initSign(myPrivateKey);

    mySig.update(data);

    byte[] sigBytes = mySig.sign();

    // And to verify.

    Signature mySig2 = Signature.getInstance(""NONEwithRSA"");

    mySig2.initVerify(myPublicKey);

    boolean isSigValid = mySig2.verify(sigBytes);

","You may be asking about CBC-MAC.  For that, I think you just encrypt your message or file with an IV of 0 and then take the last block (16 bytes for AES256-cbc).  I found a blog post that describes how to do this with OpenSSL:
openssl enc -e -aes-256-cbc -K 0123456789ABCDEF -iv 0000000000000000 < file | tail -c 16 | od -A n


-K is where you provide your key, which the wiki page says should be different than what you're using to encrypt the file, if you're encrypting it at all.
-iv obviously provides an all-zero IV, which is the key for CBC-MAC.
The tail -c 16 is to get the last AES256-cbc block, which is 16-bytes long.
od is to convert it to hex, which that web site says is common.  Otherwise instead of od -A n you could do base64 if that's more applicable, or leave it off completely to have just the raw bytes.


You can't take an AES HMAC of a file because AES256-cbc is a block cipher, not a hashing algorithm.  AES256-cbc is for encrypting and decrypting a file.  HMAC is for verifying a file's integrity and requires a hash algorithm at its core such as SHA-1 or MD5.
Are you trying to sign or verify a file, or encrypt it?  To sign, check out the OpenSSL dgst command and use simple HMACs like MD5 or SHA-1, or go all out and digitally sign it with DSS/DSA.
Also, I believe using a block cipher as a MAC is called an EMAC, but OpenSSL doesn't do EMAC as far as I know.  EMAC just takes the last block of an encrypted file and encrypts it to create a MAC.

","I suppose this is a String encoding problem.
What are you doing here?
        String enc = new String(digest);

        // Base 64 Encode the results
        String retVal = Base64.encodeBase64String(enc.getBytes());

You turn the bytes in a string, and then back to a byte array again (which you then base-64 encode).
Instead, do this:
        String retVal = Base64.encodeBase64String(digest);

In general, never ever user String.getBytes() or new String(byte[]) if you want a portable program. And never try to convert an arbitrary byte arrays (which was not a string before) to a string (other than something like Base64).

","HMAC is a symmetric algorithm, so there is no separate creation and checking algorithm. To check, you simply compute the hash as it should have been computed originally, and check that the result equals what you actually got from the client. The security rests on the HMAC key only existing on your server.
Unless you need the signatures to be verifiable by someone who doesn't know the secret key, HMAC is probably a better choice than public-key systems, for reasons of efficiency. It can take several milliseconds to create or verify a public-key signature (some years ago I timed one implementation at 15 ms per operation), whereas HMAC is quite fast.
(Oh, and you cannot verify any kind of signature without knowing the data it's supposed to sign. That wouldn't make any sense, as far as I can see).

","As Henning Makholm pointed out, HMAC is a better choice than public key.  There are some best practices you should consider for your particular scenario that will impact your choices:

Do you want to consider the hostname and scheme (http/https) in the signature? Maybe.
Do you want to consider the path in the signature? Probably.
Do you want to consider the query string in the signature? Probably.
Do you want to normalize the argument order and escaping prior to signing? Usually not.
Do you want to embed signature time etc (to create time-limited URLs)?
Do you want to tie the signed URL to some other user state, such as cookie?
Are you using user-generated or user-visible content directly in the HMAC? If so, you should ""salt"" the key using a value that is randomized for each request.

When computing the signature, you'll need to encode it in a URL-friendly way (base64 and base32 are popular choices) and choose an HMAC algorithm (such as SHA-256), and decide how many bits of the signature you want to keep (truncating the HMAC value in half is usually safe).  If you choose base64, beware of the different alphabets used by url-safe vs non-url-safe implementations.
Here is a pseudocode implementation (w/o error checking or salting etc) for signing path + query string:
const secret = ...;

def sign(path, querystring):
  return path + ""?"" + querystring + ""&sig="" + url_encode(base64_encode(hmacsha256(secret, path + ""?"" + querystring).truncate(16)))

def verify(path, querystring):
  querystring_without_sig = remove_query_parameter(querystring, ""sig"")
  sig = base64_decode(url_decode(get_query_parameter(querystring, ""sig"")))
  if hmacsha256(secret, path + ""?"" + querystring_without_sig)[:16] != sig:
    raise ""invalid sig""

HMAC SHA256 is recommended and is available in all common languages.
Java:
Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA256"");
mac.init(secret);
return mac.doFinal(value.getBytes());

Python:
hmac.new(secret, input, hashlib.sha256).digest()

PHP:
hash_hmac(""sha256"", value, secret);

","HMAC and SHA256 are separate components in OpenSSL, you'll need to glue them together yourself.  (Note that this uses the shorthand methods for doing everything in one shot with monolithic buffers; incremental processing is more complex.)

Even if your input is a string, the result is an arbitrary byte array; if that too needs to be a string then you'll have to apply some other transformation like hexadecimal expansion, Base64 or whatever suits your application.

"29147654","How should I implement 'Token Based Authentication' to a set of web APIs in a secure way using PHP and MySQL (without using OAuth)?","I've developed few web APIs in PHP using Slim framework which are used by mobile apps(iOS and Android) to process their requests and get the required data.
Eventually, in every API I'm sending the requests received from mobile app to the respective function present in a code base of my website. Then the respective function accepts the request and request parameters, process the request and returns the required data. Then the API returns the data to the mobile app in JSON format. This is the current work flow.
Now, I want to make the availability of website resources (i.e. functions from website's code base and data) subject to user authentication. In short, I want to implement 'Token Based Authentication' scheme in this scenario. 
Following should be the flow after I implement 'Token Based Authentication':

When user first time logs in to the system by sending user name and password in an request to the login API, one security token will get generate upon successful verification of the user name and password combination for that particular user. This security token will also get stored into some MySQL database table along with the user name/password/some hashed value to identify the user in further processing. If the verification fails the security token should not get generate and the user should also not log in.
Upon successful login, the generated security token will be sent back to the user in success response of login API. Now until the user is logged in with each subsequent request this token will be sent to the concerned API and ultimately it will be sent to the authentication function for the authentication of it's validity.
If with any request an invalid token is sent then the ""Please login first "" message should be sent in response and the website resource should not get access.
Once user logs out this security token entry should be deleted from the database or whatever appropriate action should be taken on it.

Since, I'm working on 'Token Based Authentication' for the first time in my career I might be wrong with my above approach. If I'm doing anything wrong please correct my mistake/s.
I found following links but those I didn't find much useful since they are lacking working code example with step-by-step description :
PHP HMAC Restful API that uses Phalcon Micro framework
PEAR package for JWT
If you could provide me the entire code which consists the database table creation, connectivity between PHP and MySQL, then creation of security token, checking the validity of security token for the current logged in user, etc. it would be really great for me.
Also, if you could give the working code example for any of the above two (or both) options as your answer to this question that would also be very great. If you have any other option apart from the two I provided with complete working code example you are welcome with your answer. 
N.B.:- Please don't suggest me to use OAuth authentication process.
Following is the code I tried on my own but I don't know whether it's right or wrong. Is my approach correct or wrong?
To create a token I use this function which takes as parameters, the user's data
define('SECRET_KEY', ""fakesecretkey"");

function createToken($data)
{
    /* Create a part of token using secretKey and other stuff */
    $tokenGeneric = SECRET_KEY.$_SERVER[""SERVER_NAME""]; // It can be 'stronger' of course

    /* Encoding token */
    $token = hash('sha256', $tokenGeneric.$data);

    return array('token' => $token, 'userData' => $data);
}

So a user can authentified himself and receive an array which contains a token (genericPart + his data, encoded), and hisData not encoded :
function auth($login, $password)
{
    // we check user. For instance, it's ok, and we get his ID and his role.
    $userID = 1;
    $userRole = ""admin"";

    // Concatenating data with TIME
    $data = time().""_"".$userID.""-"".$userRole;
    $token = createToken($data);
    echo json_encode($token);
}

Then the user can send me his token + his un-encoded data in order to check :
define('VALIDITY_TIME', 3600);

function checkToken($receivedToken, $receivedData)
{
    /* Recreate the generic part of token using secretKey and other stuff */
    $tokenGeneric = SECRET_KEY.$_SERVER[""SERVER_NAME""];

    // We create a token which should match
    $token = hash('sha256', $tokenGeneric.$receivedData);   

    // We check if token is ok !
    if ($receivedToken != $token)
    {
        echo 'wrong Token !';
        return false;
    }

    list($tokenDate, $userData) = explode(""_"", $receivedData);
    // here we compare tokenDate with current time using VALIDITY_TIME to check if the token is expired
    // if token expired we return false

    // otherwise it's ok and we return a new token
    return createToken(time().""#"".$userData);   
}

$check = checkToken($_GET['token'], $_GET['data']);
if ($check !== false)
    echo json_encode(array(""secureData"" => ""Oo"")); // And we add the new token for the next request

Am I right?
","You could do it this way.
Each user has a private key (a random alpha-numeric x long string) - which is unique to each user.
On every request, you can hash_hmac the request with their private key which will generate a unique request key for each user. For example:
 Request:
 GET /v1/products/coffee

 Private key: 
 ww9k6fcysu30sbuzu7ez57z2kzvefyxwosrjcnwo

I would then generate a request key like;
hash_hmac(""sha1"", ""GET /v1/products/coffee"", ""ww9k6fcysu30sbuzu7ez57z2kzvefyxwosrjcnwo"");

This would give me a request key of: 45751dce6ef93655a71e7b82a6179591c346c2c1 for this GET request only. It will also ensure the client intended for this endpoint and hasn't been tampered with.
On the receiving end you would perform the same hash_hmac routine with the users private key (they would need to pass in their username in the request - for example - to perform a lookup to fetch the private key) and compare the two results.
hash_hmac(""sha1"", $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] . "" "" . $_SERVER['REDIRECT_URL'], $user_private_key);

For added bonus, you would get a hash for POST/PUT body content and append that in the request query string and authenticate that on the receiving end. For example;
$bodyhash = md5(implode("","", $_POST));

When a user logs out, deactivate the private key and assign them a new one on next login.

","Based on our discussion, you could do something akin to OAuth2.0. I would recommend implementing the full spec, but since it is your application, you could make changes.

In slim, you could have as few as three endpoints:
POST username/password:
/oauth/v1/authenticate/
returns { token: foo }
GET where {token} is your unique token
/oauth/v1/token/{token}
returns { username: joe, permissions['page:admin','users:full'], expires: 123456}
DELETE pass the {token}
/oauth/v1/token/revoke
replies with 200 OK and an empty body.
Now, how it works:

When they auth, just return a JSON object with your token, which the client stores in something like a cookie.
The client passes this to your resource server in a header as identified in the RFC section 2.1 (which looks up the user permissions in a database/nosql/whatever):


GET /resource HTTP/1.1
 Host: server.example.com

 Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM


Your resource server contacts the Slim API on the back-end to determine your permissions. The server then decides what you're allowed to see.
If you don't like sending it as a header, see section 2.2, which describes how to send it in the body, or section 2.3 which sends it as a URI query.
These obviously do not need to be different servers. You can implement it how you wish.

"47686677","How to generate HMAC-SHA256 in .Net Core?","I am using this page to generate some test HMAC-SHA256 hashes for some texts: 
https://www.liavaag.org/English/SHA-Generator/HMAC/
However, when I try to use the approach in this MSDN guide in my .Net Core project, I do not get the same results. Could some one explain to me how to get identical results to those I get from the previous web page in my C# code?
Here is my code:
// My own GetHash method usage:
var hashed = PasswordHelper.GetHash(""Test"", Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(""123""));

public static string GetHash(string password, byte[] salt)
{
    // derive a 256-bit subkey (use HMACSHA1 with 10,000 iterations)
    string hashed = Convert.ToBase64String(KeyDerivation.Pbkdf2(
        password: password,
        salt: salt,
        prf: KeyDerivationPrf.HMACSHA256,
        iterationCount: 10000,
        numBytesRequested: 256 / 8));
    return hashed;
}

","Using the following approach:
public static String GetHash(String text, String key)
{
    // change according to your needs, an UTF8Encoding
    // could be more suitable in certain situations
    ASCIIEncoding encoding = new ASCIIEncoding();

    Byte[] textBytes = encoding.GetBytes(text);
    Byte[] keyBytes = encoding.GetBytes(key);

    Byte[] hashBytes;

    using (HMACSHA256 hash = new HMACSHA256(keyBytes))
        hashBytes = hash.ComputeHash(textBytes);

    return BitConverter.ToString(hashBytes).Replace(""-"", """").ToLower();
}

you will get the same result as the site you provided:
Console.WriteLine(GetHash(""qwerty"",""123456""));
// 3364ad93c083dc76d7976b875912442615cc6f7e3ce727b2316173800ca32b3a

Proof:

Actually, the code you are using, which is based on this tutorial and on KeyDerivation.Pbkdf2, is producing different results because it uses a much more complex parametrization and another encoding. But despite the results being different, you should REALLY use the approach provided by the example, and stick on the UTF8 encoding.

I thought I got it right, but the results aren't the same for the examples listed on the Wikipedia page. I've seen several examples of people using HMAC SHA256 in Classic ASP by including a WSC. This is not what I want to do. 
Here's the function:
Public Function HMAC_SHA256(prmKey, prmData)
    Dim theKey : theKey = prmKey
    Dim Block_Size, O_Pad, I_Pad
    Block_Size = 64

    Dim iter, iter2
    If Len(theKey) < Block_Size Then
        For iter = 1 to Block_Size - Len(theKey)
            theKey = theKey & chr(0)
        Next
    ElseIf Len(theKey) > Block_Size Then

    Next

    HMAC_SHA256 = SHA256(o_key_pad & SHA256(i_key_pad & prmData))
End Function

And here's the pseudocode from Wikipedia's HMAC:
function hmac (key, message)
    if (length(key) > blocksize) then
        key = hash(key) // keys longer than blocksize are shortened
    end if
    if (length(key) < blocksize) then
        key = key ∥ [0x00 * (blocksize - length(key))] // keys shorter than blocksize are zero-padded (where ∥ is concatenation)
    end if

    o_key_pad = [0x5c * blocksize] ⊕ key // Where blocksize is that of the underlying hash function
    i_key_pad = [0x36 * blocksize] ⊕ key // Where ⊕ is exclusive or (XOR)

    return hash(o_key_pad ∥ hash(i_key_pad ∥ message)) // Where ∥ is concatenation
end function

I can't for the life of me determine what's wrong here. I imagine someone's going to tell me it's impossible in ASP and that's why there are so many suggestions to use the WSC. If this is the case, can someone explain why it's impossible? I don't see anything that should make this impossible.
Thanks!
EDIT: I've made sure the SHA256 function I use is giving the correct hashes, so it's nothing to do with that. I've also tried UCase'ing the results of the SHA256 function, and no dice.

","Well, I once implemented TEA (tiny encryption algorithm) in classic ASP and had similar problems. In my case, the root cause was, that ASP saves the strings you are concatenating (& char) again as UTF-16 and so the offsets did not always match up where I expected them. 
I don't know if this applies to your use case, since I had to work with UTF-8 special characters.
My solution was to work with an array of longs, that I could target properly with my binary functions. Here are the functions to work with this array, hoping they are helpful for you.

","The issue is because VBScript String is not a bytearray, so when you concat chr(0) you are adding 2 0 bytes to string.
Anyway VBScript is a nighmare for managing bytes and words, so I suggest you use a crypt javascript API that we have wrapped for ASP VBScript use.

function hmac (key, message)
    if (length(key) > blocksize) then
        key = hash(key) // keys longer than blocksize are shortened
    end if
    if (length(key) < blocksize) then
        key = key ∥ [0x00 * (blocksize - length(key))] // keys shorter than blocksize are zero-padded (where ∥ is concatenation)
    end if

    o_key_pad = [0x5c * blocksize] ⊕ key // Where blocksize is that of the underlying hash function
    i_key_pad = [0x36 * blocksize] ⊕ key // Where ⊕ is exclusive or (XOR)

    return hash(o_key_pad ∥ hash(i_key_pad ∥ message)) // Where ∥ is concatenation
end function

I can't for the life of me determine what's wrong here. I imagine someone's going to tell me it's impossible in ASP and that's why there are so many suggestions to use the WSC. If this is the case, can someone explain why it's impossible? I don't see anything that should make this impossible.
Thanks!
EDIT: I've made sure the SHA256 function I use is giving the correct hashes, so it's nothing to do with that. I've also tried UCase'ing the results of the SHA256 function, and no dice.
EDIT2: Added example from wiki page.
","A long time ago I used this SHA256 construction. I think you can still use it in your classic asp pages, save code as asp file and do a virtual include in your page. You can use SHA256(string) to encrypt given string to a 64 char length like this: 6eea044931e914308aab890967338b2fe7e88de181a27e704c284d2b39580284.
To make it more robust you could add the rowid or timestamp plus password when you insert it into the database. This way it also needs to compare RowID+PASS or RowID+TimeStamp+PASS to the hash. 
I have used this for many years without any problem. It is not the fastest and best written script but it works.

Within the web-farm each machine has the same machine key, so the ViewState will work across machines, however, I need to do HMAC message authentication which will work across machines, so I figured that since all machines use the same machine key, there should be a way to derive a key from that to use as the HMAC key.
I notice that as of .NET 4.0 there is the MachineKey class, however, I am stuck with using .NET 3.5, and this is unavailable to me.
Is there a way to get some sort key that is the same on all machines without generating my own, for use in an ASP.NET 3.5 environment?
Edit
I don't actually need the machine key itself, just the validation key that is derived from the machine key (or equivalent).
","You can read the machine key from the web.config. This link shows how to do so: http://aspnetresources.com/blog/how_to_read_auto_generated_machinekey
Keep in mind, that the author of the article reads the generated machine key - so you have to do some changes in the code.
I just read the article a little bit more and saw, that it uses reflection, which isn't neccessary, if you store the machine key inside the web.config.
Essentially it breaks down to this line:
MachineKeySection section = (MachineKeySection) 
  ConfigurationManager.GetSection (""system.web/machineKey"");

"20047418","PBKDF2 with HMAC in Java","I am working on a Java project where I must ensure the confidentiality and integrity of users password saved in a plaintext file. 
To do so, I will write only a hash of the password in the file. More specifically, my intention is to write the hash of the password and a random salt, plus the random salt itself, to avoid the use of rainbow and lookup tables. I also want to use key-stretching with PBKDF2, to make the computation of the hash computationally expensive. 
Finally, I would like to use a keyed hash algorithm, HMAC, for a final layer of protection.
I am trying to implement my thoughts in a Java code, and I have found some examples of the operations that I have presented above:
private static byte[] pbkdf2(char[] password, byte[] salt, int iterations, int bytes)
    throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException
{
    PBEKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password, salt, iterations, bytes * 8);
    SecretKeyFactory skf = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1"");
    return skf.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();
}

The thing that I really cannot understand is how to input my secret key as the key used by the HMAC algorithm, as it doesn't seem an input to the function. I have looked through the Java documentation, but I cannot find a solution to my question.
At this point, I am not really sure if I understood correctly how the different part of the encryption mechanism work, so I would accept any help on the topic.
","I think I see the confusion. You're apparently expecting your code to apply PBKDF2 then HMAC-SHA-1. That's not how it works: HMAC-SHA-1 is used inside PBKDF2.
The gist of PBKDF2 is to apply a function repeatedly which has the following properties:

it takes two arguments;
it returns a fixed-size value;
it is practically undistinguishable from a pseudo-random function.

HMAC-SHA-1 is such a function, and a common choice. There are other variants of PBKDF2, using HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA-256, or other functions (but these variants aren't in the basic Java library).
PBKDF2 takes two data inputs (plus some configuration inputs): the password, and a salt. If you want to include a secret value in the calculation, PBKDF2's input is the place for it: don't tack on a custom scheme on top of that (doing your own crypto is a recipe for doing it wrong). Append the pepper (secret value common to all accounts) to the salt (public value that varies between accounts).
Note that pepper is of limited usefulness. It's only useful if the hashes and the pepper secret value are stored in different places — for example, if the hashes are in a database and the pepper is in a disk file that is not directly vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

","Let the JDK do the work for you:
String[] array = {""8C"", ""D9"", ""26"", ""1D"", ""69"", ""B7"", ""96"", ""DB""};

StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();
for ( String hex : array ) {
    output.append( (char)Integer.parseInt( hex, 16 ) );

Basically just that one line inside the loop is all you need.
If you wanted your input to be just one big String (which would seem more convenient), just do this instead:
String input = ""8CD9261D69B796DB"";

StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();
for ( String hex : input.replaceAll( ""..(?!$)"", ""$0,"" ).split( "","" ) ) {
    output.append( (char)Integer.parseInt( hex, 16 ) );

If you want byte[] result, do this:
String[] array = {""8C"", ""D9"", ""26"", ""1D"", ""69"", ""B7"", ""96"", ""DB""};

byte[] bytes = new byte[array.length];

"42100488","How do I sign a POST request using HMAC-SHA512 and the Python requests library?","I'm trying to use Python to access the trading API at poloniex.com, a cryptocurrency exchange. To do this I must follow this prescription:

All calls to the trading API are sent via HTTP POST to https://poloniex.com/tradingApi and must contain the following headers:
Key - Your API key.
  Sign - The query's POST data signed by your key's ""secret"" according to the HMAC-SHA512 method.  
Additionally, all queries must include a ""nonce"" POST parameter. The nonce parameter is an integer which must always be greater than the previous nonce used.

Here is what I have so far. My current issue is that I do not know how to compile the POST url so that it can be signed without sending the incomplete request first. This obviously doesn't work.
import requests
import hmac
import hashlib
import time

headers = { 'nonce': '',
            'Key' : 'myKey',
            'Sign': '',}
payload = { 'command': 'returnCompleteBalances',
            'account': 'all'}
secret = 'mySecret'

headers['nonce'] = int(time.time())
response = requests.post( 'https://poloniex.com/tradingApi', params= payload, headers= headers )
headers['Sign'] = hmac.new( secret, response.url, hashlib.sha512)

","Create a prepared request; you can add headers to that after the body has been created:
import requests
import hmac
import hashlib


request = requests.Request(
    'POST', 'https://poloniex.com/tradingApi',
    data=payload, headers=headers)
prepped = request.prepare()
signature = hmac.new(secret, prepped.body, digestmod=hashlib.sha512)
prepped.headers['Sign'] = signature.hexdigest()

with requests.Session() as session:
    response = session.send(prepped)

I changed your params argument to data; for a POST request it is customary to send the parameters in the body, not the URL.
For the nonce, I'd use a itertools.count() object, seeded from the current time so restarts don't affect it. According to the Poloniex API documentation (which you quoted in your question), the nonce is part of the POST body, not the headers, so put it in the payload dictionary:
from itertools import count
import time

# store as a global variable
NONCE_COUNTER = count(int(time.time() * 1000))

# then every time you create a request
payload['nonce'] = next(NONCE_COUNTER)

Using int(time.time()) would re-use the same number if you created more than one request per second. The example code provided by Poloniex uses int(time.time()*1000) to make it possible to create a request every microsecond instead, but using your own monotonically increasing counter (seeded from time.time()) is far more robust.
You can also encapsulate the digest signing process in a custom authentication object; such an object is passed in the prepared request as the last step in preparation:
import hmac
import hashlib

class BodyDigestSignature(object):
    def __init__(self, secret, header='Sign', algorithm=hashlib.sha512):
        self.secret = secret
        self.header = header
        self.algorithm = algorithm

    def __call__(self, request):
        body = request.body
        if not isinstance(body, bytes):   # Python 3
            body = body.encode('latin1')  # standard encoding for HTTP
        signature = hmac.new(self.secret, body, digestmod=self.algorithm)
        request.headers[self.header] = signature.hexdigest()
        return request

Use this with your requests calls:
response = requests.post(
    'https://poloniex.com/tradingApi',
    data=payload, headers=headers, auth=BodyDigestSignature(secret))

The argument passed in is the secret used in the HMAC digest; you can also pass in  a different header name.

","For some reason hmac_init on Quercus and GAE gives errors. One solution is to use above mentioned java method and class, import it to PHP instance and call compute.
1) Add scr/phpgae directory id you dont have yet
2) Add phpgae.HmacSHA256 line to src/WEB-INF/services/com.caucho.QuercusModule
3) Add scr/phpgae/HmacSHA256.java to your GAE application:

    package phpgae;
import java.security.InvalidKeyException;

import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;

import javax.crypto.Mac;

import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

import com.caucho.util.Base64;

    public String compute(String baseString, String key) throws InvalidKeyException, NoSuchAlgorithmException {

        mac = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA256"");
        SecretKeySpec secret = new SecretKeySpec(key.getBytes(), mac.getAlgorithm());
        mac.init(secret);
        byte[] digest = mac.doFinal(baseString.getBytes());
        return Base64.encode(digest);
    }
}


Note I'm using SHA256 here. Eclipse compiles everything on fly, otherwise you need to complile class manually.
4) On PHP here is what you do:

<?php

import phpgae.HmacSHA256;

$c = new HmacSHA256;

echo $c->compute( 'your base string' ,  'your key' );

?>

","Don't do this:
byte[] bytes = data.getBytes();

That will use the platform default encoding to convert a string to a byte array. That can vary between platform, whereas you want something repeatable. I would suggest UTF-8:
byte[] bytes = data.getBytes(""UTF-8"");

(Do the same for the key, of course.)
You should then use the same encoding in your C# - not ASCII, unless you really want to not handle non-ASCII characters.
byte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data);

It's also not clear how you're comparing the results afterwards - don't forget that byte is signed in Java, but unsigned in C#. It's probably simplest to convert the hash to hex or base64 for comparison purposes.
EDIT: I strongly suspect the last part was the problem - comparing the results.

In the environment I'm using I can't use nodejs, so no require('crypto') ... or at least I do not know of a way of using it outside node.
I'm following the example guide here: http://pusher.com/docs/rest_api; I'm stuck in the part 
where it says I should generate the HMAC SHA256 hex digest.
I am using this library http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/#HMAC
So, following the instructions on Pusher i wrote
CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(
  'POST\n/apps/3/channels/project-3/events\nauth_key=278d425bdf160c739803&auth_timestamp=1272044395&auth_version=1.0&body_md5=7b3d404f5cde4a0b9b8fb4789a0098cb&name=foo',
  '7ad3773142a6692b25b8'
);

But that's giving me 20b132baa2aaf44ea1fab814f0788aaa44eed23a2d252c72e4dc2aaea0d6ac24 instead of b3152b2bb5a5b0bae66435a498797aa763e9b74f86cc97c9175424f8308b2f80.
What is bothering me is that I didn't do the ""hex digest"" part, so maybe that's what I'm missing, but I couldn't find a suitable lib to do this in javascript.
Do you spot any errors in what I did? Do you have a library to suggest?
Thanks in advance for any help.
","I was struggling with doing the exact same thing. Pusher's documentation should really be clearer about this issue. It turns out it's not the encyption methods. It's the order that you list your parameters. The body of your message has to be exactly formatted like this:
{""data"":""{\""message\"":\""hello world\""}"",""name"":""my_event"",""channel"":""test_channel""}
Data has to be first, then message, followed by name and then finally the channel name.
Then when you create your auth signature you have to list your parameters as so:
POST\n/apps/3/events\nauth_key=278d425bdf160c739803&auth_timestamp=1353088179&auth_version=1.0&body_md5=ec365a775a4cd0599faeb73354201b6f
So auth key is first, then the timestamp, followed by the auth version and finally the body md5.
I got it to work once I followed this exact pattern. Hopefully this helps!

What is the blocksize? What does the zeroes-function do on line 8? How do you express lines 12-13 in C++?
"," 1. What is the blocksize ?
Usually, hash algorithm process data by cutting it into chunks of fixed size data (aka. ""blocks""). For SHA1, I the usual block size is 64 bytes.
2. What does the zeros function do on line 8 ?
It (as the comment states) adds ""zeroes"" to the end of key so that its length matches the ""block"" size.
3. How do you express lines 12-13 in C++ ?
I think you're looking for the XOR operator: ^.
Example:
o_key_pad = (0x5c * blocksize) ^ key; // Actually, it should be 0x5c5c5c... repeated enough so that it matches key size.

Just a quick note: this has nothing special to do with Qt and you will probably want to do it in ""raw"" C++ so that you can eventually reuse it in a non-Qt project. Qt is great imho, but you clearly don't require it to implement this.

The request uses an HMAC created with SHA256.  I have a Ruby client that I am using to make the request and since I'm new to encryption I am having a difficult time getting it to generate a matching HMAC.  I have tried not making it URL safe, and that matches.  So I'm really wondering is how I can get the Ruby client to match with the URL safe version (since I can't change the Java code).  It's just got an extra = character at the end.  Thanks in advance for any help.
For Ruby I am using 1.9.3 and for Java I am using 6u31 along with the commons-codec-1.6.jar library from apache.

","Ruby does not remove the trailing '=' - it is not an absolute requirement, as you can read in RFC 4648 it just states that removing them might be desirable in certain applications. But other than that it is guaranteed that Ruby's URL-safe encoding will be exactly the same as Java's.
So the only thing for you to do is strip off the trailing '==', you could for example use a regex:
encoded_url_safe_.gsub!(/=+$/, """")

When i submit the payment my page comes to this particular code and the error it throws is
 Fatal error: Uncaught SoapFault exception: [HTTP] in C:\wamp\www\Fd\php\process.php:49 Stack trace: #0 C:\wamp\www\Fd\php\process.php(49): SoapClient->__doRequest('<?xml version=""...', 'https://api.dem...', 'http://secure2....', 1, 0) #1 [internal function]: SoapClientHMAC->__doRequest('<?xml version=""...', 'https://api.dem...', 'http://secure2....', 1, 0) #2 C:\wamp\www\Fd\php\process.php(104): SoapClient->__call('SendAndCommit', Array) #3 C:\wamp\www\Fd\php\process.php(104): SoapClientHMAC->SendAndCommit(Array) #4 {main} thrown in C:\wamp\www\Fd\php\process.php on line 48.

And the line 48 is 
return parent::__doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version, $one_way);

I couldn't really figure out what this error is. Googled and tried various solutions but no success.Also I have both the soap and openssl enabled in my php server if that is of any help.
Thanks in advance for any help.
","A little bit too late but anyways... just dump that garbage SOAP code, heres my early stage JSON and CURL version

I couldn't really figure out what this error is. Googled and tried various solutions but no success.Also I have both the soap and openssl enabled in my php server if that is of any help.
Thanks in advance for any help.
","I tried SOAP with no success, finally had to switch to JSON.
@KukoBit's answer worked for me. Only problem was the date string which is expected in GMT. I solved it by calculating date as follows:
$gge4Date = strftime(""%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"", time() - (int) substr(date('O'), 0, 3)*60*60) . 'Z';

Hope this helps.
ps. I know this should be a comment, but due to points restrictions, I cannot.

And the line 48 is

I couldn't really figure out what this error is. Googled and tried various solutions but no success.Also I have both the soap and openssl enabled in my php server if that is of any help.
Thanks in advance for any help.

For example, in oauth 2, the client sends its secret key to the provider without any hashing whatsoever.  Is this considered secure because it's over https?  While not strictly oauth, would using HMAC on this call make oauth 2 more secure?  If so, why isn't that a standard part of oauth 2?
","The OAuth 2 standard requires that the authorization server MUST use HTTPS on all of its endpoints and the client SHOULD use a callback protected with HTTPS. Since message contents (headers, query parameters and fragments considering OAuth) are known only by the server and the client, usage of an HTTPS connection is considered to be safe. Thus there's no gain using a separate signature for authorization request, that's why such signatures are not even mentioned in the standard.
This not necessarily hold for the response though. If the client receives the authorization response to an unprotected callback, then it cannot verify its validity. In such cases, an attacker can send arbitrary authorization results to the client. Adding a signature with the callback parameters, you may avoid this. However, it seems to be a better solution to use mutual client/server authentication with a HTTPS callback instead.
While there's no real gain using signatures during authorization, they may be useful to access protected resources to avoid stealing access tokens. This is why the MAC token type is in the standard, see section 7.1.

ANSWER:
The issue was caused by a misleading documentation stating the key is provided in Base64 format. See the accepted answer:
var shaKeyBytes = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(key);

","Your result is correct, the difference is because the tool you link to does not decode Base64 for the key value and treats it as a series of characters.
E.g. To duplicate its result treat your key as a string:
var shaKeyBytes = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(""AgQGCAoMDhASFAIEBggKDA4QEhQCBAYICgwOEBIUAgQ="");

","HMAC:  It is a message authentication code.It is used to verify the sender's data integrity and it is a forward only algorithm.It works on the shared secret key which is known by sender and receiver both.Before generating hash value we have to encode key and message. we can use either one of the encoding UTF8 or ASCIIEncoding.
UTF8 encoding:
var signature = ""123456:some-string:2016-04-12T12:44:16Z"";
var key = ""AgQGCAoMDhASFAIEBggKDA4QEhQCBAYICgwOEBIUAgQ="";


var signatureBytes = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(signature);
var shaKeyBytes = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(key);

ASCIIEncoding Encoding:

var key = ""AgQGCAoMDhASFAIEBggKDA4QEhQCBAYICgwOEBIUAgQ="";

var signatureBytes = System.Text.ASCIIEncoding.GetBytes(signature);

The public methods all work fine, but the Trading API Methods require some extra tricks:

All calls to the trading API are sent via HTTP POST to https://poloniex.com/tradingApi and must contain the following headers:
  Key - Your API key.
  Sign - The query's POST data signed by your key's ""secret"" according to the HMAC-SHA512 method.
  Additionally, all queries must include a ""nonce"" POST parameter. The nonce parameter is an integer which must always be greater than the previous nonce used.
  All responses from the trading API are in JSON format.

My code for returnBalances looks like this:
import hashlib
import hmac
from time import time

import requests


class Poloniex:
    def __init__(self, APIKey, Secret):
        self.APIKey = APIKey
        self.Secret = Secret

Any help is highly appreciated!
","The payload you pass to requests.post has to be either a valid query string or a dict corresponding to that query string. Normally, it's more convenient just to pass a dict and get requests to build the query string for you, but in this case we need to construct an HMAC signature from the query string, so we use the standard urlib.parse module to build the query string. 
Annoyingly, the urlib.parse.urlencode function returns a text string, so we need to encode it into a bytes string in order to make it acceptable to hashlib. The obvious encoding to use is UTF-8: encoding a text string that only contains plain ASCII as UTF-8 will create a byte sequence that's identical to the equivalent Python 2 string (and of course urlencode will only ever return plain ASCII), so this code will behave identically to the old Python 2 code on the Poloniex API page you linked. 
from time import time
import urllib.parse
import hashlib
import hmac

APIkey = b'AAA-BBB-CCC'
secret = b'123abc'

payload = {
    'command': 'returnBalances',
    'nonce': int(time() * 1000),
}

paybytes = urllib.parse.urlencode(payload).encode('utf8')
print(paybytes)

sign = hmac.new(secret, paybytes, hashlib.sha512).hexdigest()
print(sign)

output
b'command=returnBalances&nonce=1492868800766'

And then you can do something like
headers = {
    'Key': APIKey,
    'Sign': sign,
}

The ""key"" and ""message"" are the same, but the Java version gets a different HMAC than the Python implementation does.
I suspect there's a subtle error somewhere in the Python code(because the Java version matches the expected results from the RFC) but I'm not sure where. It looks so straightforward.
","I think the problem is that in Java, you're using the raw bytes as the key (only converting them to a hex string for output):
System.out.println(""Key is..."" + bytesToHex(keyBytes) + ""\n"");
// ...
SecretKeySpec macKey = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, ""RAW"");

But in Python, you're using the hex string:
k = ""3132333435363738393031323334353637383930""

It looks like you can decode the hex string with:
raw_key = k.decode('hex')

That said, do have a plan to deal with collisions if they occur (maybe alter the timestamp slightly, or add a nonce?)
For that matter, if the sha1 is based on more than just the content of the document, why not simply make it a random ID? In this case collisions are less of a problem, as you can always generate a new random number and try again (the probability of a collision with a single try is the same, however).

","First of all, for those wondering, this is in reference to my answer to this question: Objective-C sample code for HMAC-SHA1

The HMAC you generate is a 256-bit binary value that may or may not start with a 0 byte.
To be able to print it, you need a string representation (binary, hex, decimal, base64, etc.). Base64 is one of the most efficient among these, that's why I used a Base64 encoding there.
The reason you get garbage is that most (if not all) of the octets in the HMAC value are outside the range of printable ASCII characters. If the first octet is 0 (0x00), you get nil. This is why you need an encoding that supports arbitrary values. ASCII doesn't.
Of course, if you don't want to print the HMAC value, then may not need such an encoding, and can keep the HMAC as is (binary NSData).

","You simply forgot to mimic pack()'s behavior in your Java code (whatever you need that for). 
Use
final SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec( DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary(PayboxConstants.KEY), ""HmacSHA512"" );

Where DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary() is from the JAXB API.

","HMAC authentication is better served for an API that third parties are going to connect to. It seems like your app would be better served by writing a cookie to the client's browser indicating that they've been authenticated. Then with each ajax request you can check for that cookie. 
Edit: I take back a bit of what I said about HMAC being better served for third party APIs. Traditionally with HMAC each user gets their own private key. I don't think this is necessary for your application. You can probably get away with just keeping one master private key and give each user a unique ""public"" key (I call it a public key, but in actuality the user would never know about the key). When a user logs in I would write two cookies. One which is the combination of the user's public key + time stamp encrypted and another key stating what the time stamp is. Then on the server side you can validate the encrypted key and check that the time stamp is within a given threshold (say 10-30 minutes in case they're sitting around idle on your app). If they're validated, update the encrypted key and time stamp, rinse and repeat.

","The answer: You technically cannot prevent the user from modifying the JavaScript. So don't worry about that because you can do nothing about it.
However, the attack you do need to prevent is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Malicious scripts on different domains are capable of automatically submitting forms to your domain with the cookies stored by the browser. To deal with that, you need to include an authentication token (which should be sufficiently random, not related to the username or password, and sent in the HTML page in which the chat client resides) in the actual data sent by the AJAX request (which is not automatically filled in by the browser).

How is this secure if the javascript application needs to be aware of the private key?

Why not? It's the user's own private key, so if he is willing to give it out to someone else, it's his problem. It's no different from giving out your password and then saying someone else has access to your account.
If you think about this a bit, you'll realize that you don't need to implement public-key encryption, HMAC or anything like that. Your normal session-based authentication will do, provided the communication channel itself is secure (say using HTTPS).

","I'm pretty sure that you're dealing with the new RedSys SHA256 signature implementation. Also I saw that you have some issue with the 3DES encryption between PHP and C#.
First at all you must get the base 64 string with all the payment parameters. You can achieve it with this code:
public static string GetParameters(string merchantCode, string terminal, int currency, string transactionType, decimal amount, string merchantOrder, string merchantIdentifier, string merchantPost, string urlOk, string urlKo)
        {
            var jsonValues = new Dictionary<string, string>
            {
                { ""Ds_Merchant_Amount"", amount.ToString().Replace(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.NumberFormat.NumberDecimalSeparator, """") },
                { ""Ds_Merchant_Order"", merchantOrder},
                { ""Ds_Merchant_MerchantCode"", merchantCode },
                { ""Ds_Merchant_Currency"", currency.ToString() },
                { ""Ds_Merchant_TransactionType"", transactionType },
                { ""Ds_Merchant_Terminal"", terminal },
                { ""Ds_Merchant_Identifier"", merchantIdentifier },
                { ""Ds_Merchant_MerchantURL"", merchantPost },
                { ""Ds_Merchant_UrlOK"", urlOk},
                { ""Ds_Merchant_UrlKO"",  urlKo}
            }.Select(kvp => ""\""{0}\"":\""{1}\"""".Formato(kvp.Key.ToUpper(), kvp.Value));

            var jsonString = ""{"" + string.Join("","", jsonValues) + ""}"";

            return Convert.ToBase64String(ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(jsonString));
        }

Once you have the JSON string in base 64, you must apply 3DES to merchant order parameter with the key provided by RedSys:
public static string GetTransactionEncryptionKey(string merchantOrder, string encryptKey)
        {
            using (var tdes = new TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider())
            {
                tdes.IV = new byte[8] { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
                tdes.Key = Convert.FromBase64String(encryptKey);
                tdes.Padding = PaddingMode.Zeros;
                tdes.Mode = CipherMode.CBC;

                var toEncrypt = ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(merchantOrder);
                var result = tdes.CreateEncryptor().TransformFinalBlock(toEncrypt, 0, toEncrypt.Length);

                return Convert.ToBase64String(result);
            }
        }

As you can see, the encryption key provided by RedSys is base 64 string so you don't need to calculate the MD5 hash for the 3DES algorithm.
Then we go for the SHA256 signature:
public static string GetSignature(string base64Parameters, string base64tranEncryptKey)
        {
            using (var sha = new HMACSHA256(Convert.FromBase64String(base64tranEncryptKey)))
            {
                var hash = sha.ComputeHash(ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(base64Parameters));

                return Convert.ToBase64String(hash);
            }

","The answer is in the documentation for the PHP function hash_hmac.

When set to TRUE, outputs raw binary data. FALSE outputs lowercase hexits.

Pass ""true"" as the final argument. Hashes are binary. When turning them into strings, they are often encoded in hexadecimal. But in this case you are going to base-64 encode it, so you want the raw binary form.

","You must pass in a reference to the hashlib.sha512 callable, not the result of calling it:

Alternatively, you could just use the string 'sha512':

"12195480","Node JS crypto, cannot create hmac on chars with accents","I am having an issue generating the correct signature in NodeJS (using crypto.js) when the text I am trying to encrypt has accented characters (such as ä,ï,ë)
generateSignature = function (str, secKey) { 
 var hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha1', secKey);
 var sig = hmac.update(str).digest('hex');
 return sig;
};

This function will return the correct HMAC signature if 'str' contains no accented characters  (chars such as ä,ï,ë). If there are accented chars present in the text, it will not return the correct HMAC. The accented characters are valid in UTF8 encoding so I dont know why crypto has a problem with them. It may be the case that I need to somehow tell crypto that I am signing utf8 encoded text, but I don't know how to do this.
The exact same problem is described in this post: NodeJS hmac digest issue with accents
However, the post itself, as well as the answer, do not make sense to me (as they are passing the data they want to encrypt where the secret key should go). 
Here is a version of the code with hard coded values for str and secKey:
  var crypto = require('crypto');

  str=""äïë"";  
  secKey=""secret""; 
  var hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha1', secKey);
  var sig = hmac.update(new Buffer(str, 'utf8')).digest('hex');
  console.log(""Sig:      "" + sig);
  console.log(""Expected: 094b2ba039775bbf970a58e4a0a61b248953d30b""); 
  // ""Expected"" was generated using http://hash.online-convert.com/sha1-generator

Output::
Sig:      39c9f1a6094c76534157739681456e7878557f58
Expected: 094b2ba039775bbf970a58e4a0a61b248953d30b
Thanks 
","The default encoding used by the crypto module is usually 'binary'. So, you'll have to specify 'utf-8' via a Buffer to use it as the encoding:
var sig = hmac.update(new Buffer(str, 'utf-8')).digest('hex');

That's what the answer for the other question was demonstrating, just for the key:
var hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha1', new Buffer(secKey, 'utf-8'));


You can also use Buffer to view the differences:
new Buffer('äïë', 'binary')
// <Buffer e4 ef eb>

new Buffer('äïë', 'utf-8')
// <Buffer c3 a4 c3 af c3 ab>


[Edit]
Running the example code you provided, I get:
Sig:      094b2ba039775bbf970a58e4a0a61b248953d30b
Expected: 094b2ba039775bbf970a58e4a0a61b248953d30b

And, modifying it slightly, I get true:
var crypto = require('crypto');

function sig(str, key) {
  return crypto.createHmac('sha1', key)
    .update(new Buffer(str, 'utf-8'))
    .digest('hex');
}

console.log(sig('äïë', 'secret') === '094b2ba039775bbf970a58e4a0a61b248953d30b');

Probably you just want HMAC::MD5.new(SECRET).digest

Lookup ""salting"" a hash first. It depends on your usage, but adding a fixed string does help by making your hashes different than the hashes from other apps. Thus, a dictionary attack is harder. But that's just generally speaking.

I don't know how to configure WebSecurityConfig to authenticate every request with my filter and Authentication Provider. I assume I need to create @Bean to initialize RestSecurityFilter. Also JavaDoc for AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter says I need to the authenticationManager property. I would appreciate working solution with custom filter, provider and token. 
","I'm not familiar with Spring Boot, but I saw your comment on my question How To Inject AuthenticationManager using Java Configuration in a Custom Filter
In a traditional Spring Security XML configuration, you would specify your custom RestSecurityFilter like so
<http use-expressions=""true"" create-session=""stateless"" authentication-manager-ref=""authenticationManager"" entry-point-ref=""restAuthenticationEntryPoint"">
       <custom-filter ref=""restSecurityFilter"" position=""FORM_LOGIN_FILTER"" />

","Mike's answer has a bug.
Don't use std::strings .length() to find the length of the key when dealing with binary data. As binary data can have null character before the true end of the data. Either take in a char array and length as parameters for both key and msg. OR if you are using C++11, you can use vector to store the binary data. 
Following is a partial implementation of Mike's answer with vectors as parameters-
std::vector<uint8_t> 
HMAC_SHA256(const std::vector<uint8_t>& key
           ,const std::vector<uint8_t>& value)
{
    unsigned int len = SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH;
    unsigned char hash[SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH];
    size_t keyLen = key.size();
    size_t valueLen = value.size();

    HMAC_CTX hmac;
    HMAC_CTX_init(&hmac);
    HMAC_Init_ex(&hmac, (unsigned char*)key.data(), keyLen, EVP_sha256(), NULL);

In testing the placeholder {{$timestamp}} at face value was passing a valid value.  When I stripped the signature back to start with just a single segment I was getting authenticated successfully.  Until of course I put the timestamp placeholder back in.  
When I swapped out the placeholder for the actual value passed in the header it worked fine.  I can only conclude that there must be some extra character I can't see. Perhaps on the Postman side when it creates the signature.  The problem extends to other placeholders such as {{$guid}}.

"15034267","HMAC-SHA256 with AES-256 in CBC mode","I recently came across the following code sample for encrypting a file with AES-256 CBC with a SHA-256 HMAC for authentication and validation:
aes_key, hmac_key = self.keys
# create a PKCS#7 pad to get us to `len(data) % 16 == 0`
pad_length = 16 - len(data) % 16
data = data + (pad_length * chr(pad_length))
# get IV
iv = os.urandom(16)

data = iv + cipher.encrypt(data)
sig = hmac.new(hmac_key, data, hashlib.sha256).digest()
# return the encrypted data (iv, followed by encrypted data, followed by hmac sig):
return data + sig

Since, in my case, I'm encrypting much more than a string, rather a fairly large file, I modified the code to do the following:
aes_key, hmac_key = self.keys
iv = os.urandom(16)
cipher = AES.new(aes_key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)

with open('input.file', 'rb') as infile:
    with open('output.file', 'wb') as outfile:

                # we have reached the end of the input file and it matches `% 16 == 0`

                # we have reached the end of the input file and it doesn't match `% 16 == 0`
                # pad it by the remainder of bytes in PKCS#7:
                end_of_line = True
                input_chunk_remainder = 16 - (len(input_chunk) & 16)
                input_chunk += input_chunk_remainder * chr(input_chunk_remainder)

            outfile.write(cipher.encrypt(input_chunk) + hmac.new(hmac_key, data,

Simply put, this reads an input file in blocks of 64KB at a time and encrypts these blocks, generating a HMAC using SHA-256 of the encrypted data, and appending that HMAC after each block. Decryption will happen by reading in 64KB + 32B chunks and calculating the HMAC of the first 64KB and comparing it against the SHA-256 sum occupying the last 32 bytes in the chunk.
Is this the right way to use an HMAC? Does it ensure security and authentication that the data was unmodified and decrypted with the right key? 
FYI, the AES and HMAC keys are both derived from the same passphrase which is generated by running the input text through SHA-512, then through bcrypt, then through SHA-512 again. The output from the final SHA-512 is then split into two chunks, one used for the AES password and the other used for the HMAC.
","I don't think there is a security problem with what you're doing with the HMACs (not that that means there isn't a problem with the security), but I don't know the actual value in HMAC sub elements of the ciphertext gets you.  Unless you want to support partial recovery of the plaintext in the event of tampering, there is not much reason to incur the overhead of HMACing 64 KB blocks, vs the full ciphertext.
From a key generation perspective, it might make more sense to use a key generated from a passphrase to encrypt two randomly generated keys, and then use the randomly generated keys to perform HMAC and AES operations.  I know using the same key for both your block cipher and HMAC is bad news, but I don't know if using a key generated in the same manner is similarly bad. 
At the very least, you should tweak your key derivation mechanism. bcrypt is a password hashing mechanism, not a key derivation function.  You should use PBKDF2 to do key derivations.

","Yes, there are 2 security problems.
But first, I assume that with this statement at the end:
# write out encrypted data and an HMAC of the block
outfile.write(cipher.encrypt(input_chunk) + hmac.new(hmac_key, data, hashlib.sha256).digest())

you actually meant:
# write out encrypted data and an HMAC of the block
data = cipher.encrypt(input_chunk)
outfile.write(data + hmac.new(hmac_key, data, hashlib.sha256).digest())

Because data is not defined anywhere.
The 1st security problem is that you are authenticating each piece independently of the others, but not the composition. In other words, the attacker can reshuffle, duplicate, or remove any of the chunks and the receiver will not notice.
A more secure approach is to have one instance of HMAC only, pass all the encrypted data to it via the update method, and output one digest, at the very end.
Alternatively, if you want to enable the receiver to detect tampering before receiving the whole file, you can output the intermediate MAC for each piece. In fact, a call to digest does not change the state of the HMAC; you can keep calling update afterwards.
The 2nd security problem is that you don't use salt for your key derivation (I say that because you don't send it). Apart from password cracking, if you encrypt more than 2 files using the same password the attacker will also be able to freely mix chunks taken by either encrypted file - because the HMAC key is the same. Solution: use salt.
One last minor thing: infile.read(64 * 1024) may return less than 64*1024 bytes, but that does not mean you reached the end of the file.

"42435095","PHP RESTful API Security","I am currently building a RESTful API in PHP which will be used to power both a web and mobile application. As such, the API should be considered public. However, I want to authenticate users when they make requests to the API from either mobile or web.
When a user registers for the service, I generate a unique API key and secret which is stored against the user's record in the database. Ideally, I want requests to be made only using the API key using JavaScript or PHP. 
I thought about establishing a hand-shake system for authentication, with the process as follows:

User makes request to the API using their known key.
The API responds with a token which is stored in a table along with a timestamp (to prevent replay attacks)
The token is then used to make the actual request by the client, and the API will check the validity of the token. If the hash matches, and the timestamp is valid, the API provides a valid response, otherwise provides information that the token is expired.

I was thinking to use HMAC to generate the token, something like this:
$token = hash_hmac('sha256', $user->apiKey.microtime(), $user->apiSecret);

The $token will then be stored in the DB, and should be unique for every request. In turn the requests can then be made using the following jQuery code:
$.getJSON('/api/user/get/1', { 'key': '123rrwfnufsd7f72' }).done(function(data) { 
    // data will now contain a token, so we use it to make another AJAX request:
    if( data.token )
    {
        $.getJSON('/api/user/get/1', { 'token': data.token }).done(function(user) {  
             // do something with user or handle bad token
        });
    }
});

My question is will this be sufficient to prevent brute-force and replay attacks?

my $cleartext = ""GET\n\n\nFri, 12 Dec 2008 10:08:51 GMT+00:00\n/"";

Here is sample output from this script:

encoded: YzCPm4oZhEDW2GhaPz9w0KqwL2g=

What I am testing is that, if I input the same secret key and cleartext into the same _encode function of the Net::Amazon::S3 package, I should see the very same secret key, cleartext, and digest bytes.
Indeed, I get the same bytes for the secret key and cleartext.
But I get something different for the digest (and of course the base64 encoding), e.g.:
$ s3ls --access-key=foobar --secret-key=abcd1234
...
secret key hex: 6162636431323334
cleartext hex: 4745540a0a0a4672692c2031322044656320323030382031303a30383a353120474d542b30303a30300a2f

encoded: wNpQBQxFGEfeftBVxSht5YRSeiI=

I have verified that the secret key and clear text are the same input to both scripts. The encoding subroutine is virtually identical in both scripts (except for an unused argument passed to the subroutine, which I remove from my custom version).
What would cause the HMAC SHA-1 digest to be computed differently in both cases, if the input bytes and _encode subroutine are the same?
(I have also verified the two scripts against the test cases at RFC 2201.)
","I'm afraid I can't help much here, but there's definitely something wrong with what you posted. Your example script produces different output for me and the output you posted really cannot be correct.
How could this

_ascii_to_hex(""blahblahblah"")

Of course, the whole ascii_to_hex thing is completely irrelevant to your problem, but it shows that you should double-check your results.

What I am testing is that, if I input the same secret key and cleartext into the same _encode function of the Net::Amazon::S3 package, I should see the very same secret key, cleartext, and digest bytes.
Indeed, I get the same bytes for the secret key and cleartext.
But I get something different for the digest (and of course the base64 encoding), e.g.:
$ s3ls --access-key=foobar --secret-key=abcd1234

I have verified that the secret key and clear text are the same input to both scripts. The encoding subroutine is virtually identical in both scripts (except for an unused argument passed to the subroutine, which I remove from my custom version).
What would cause the HMAC SHA-1 digest to be computed differently in both cases, if the input bytes and _encode subroutine are the same?
(I have also verified the two scripts against the test cases at RFC 2201.)
","I find the the main problems I have had with hashes in comparisons are:

ensure the data and key are the same in both comparisons
ensure the data and key are in the same character encoding in both comparisons
ensure the key and text are being passed the same in both scripts, i.e. which one is key and which one is text (this has caught me more than once).

Try using the Digest::SHA module to create the hash for you and compare the results with that.
use Digest::SHA qw(hmac_sha1_hex);
my $hash = hmac_sha1_hex($data, $key);

","Divide and conquer?
The test vectors in the RFC are the best place to start. Did they pass in both instances?  Which ones did you try?  If some work and others don't the most likely problem is that one of the two APIs are improperly marshalling the keys input (Signed vs unsigned arrays, charset conversions..etc)
As an aside its really difficult to help you when your example is nonsense.  As others mentioned the hex representation of blah blah is not abc..123.  Makes me wonder what else in your example is inaccurate?

The encoding subroutine is virtually identical in both scripts (except for an unused argument passed to the subroutine, which I remove from my custom version).

Since you're not comparing the digests themselves, but Base-64 encoded versions of the digests, I would recommend backing up one step and checking the digests themselves.  It may be possible that the Base-64 encoding routines are incorrect.
If you can't compare the digests themselves, then use the same encoding routine in both programs and see what you get.

I am to implement the RFC6238 to generate a 10-digit TOTP password, which will be used in a POST request later on. The sample input and output for the TOTP is supposed to be like this:
Sample Input:

Shared key: ""ninja@example.comHDECHALLENGE003"" (without double quotes)
Hash function used: HMAC-SHA-512
T0 = 0, Timestep = 30 seconds (as per specified in RFC6238)
Expected TOTP of 10 digits

Sample Output:

Successful TOTP generated: 1773133250, for time of Mon, 17 Mar 2014 15:20:51 GMT
base64 encoded POST Authorization username/password request: bmluamFAZXhhbXBsZS5jb206MTc3MzEzMzI1MA==
(I have decoded the sample POST authorization to be 'ninja@example.com:1773133250' hence why I can say that the sample TOTP output is 1773133250)

After attempting to make my own script according to the rfc6238 specification I cannot get the same output for the sample input as above. I tried using other available online TOTP modules that are available online (mostly in Python), to find that they generate the same output as the script that I created. Finally, I tried the Java code given in the example of RFC6238 and came up with the same result as my script, i.e.:
Attempted input:

Hex encoded seed for HMAC512: ""6E696E6A61406578616D706C652E636F6D4844454348414C4C454E4745303033"" + ""6E696E6A61406578616D706C652E636F6D4844454348414C4C454E4745303033"";
Time inputted is 1395069651L, representing the time received in sample output

Result of attempt (same output from custom script, other Python modules, and the Java implementation given in RFC6238 documentation):

Generated TOTP: 0490867067

Here is the code that I first used in attempt to generate the TOTP in Python:

    # 
    # ** You have to read RFC6238 (and the errata too!) and get a correct one time password by yourself.
    # ** TOTP's ""Time Step X"" is 30 seconds. ""T0"" is 0.
    # ** Use HMAC-SHA-512 for the hash function, instead of the default HMAC-SHA-1.
    # ** Token shared secret is the userid followed by ASCII string value ""HDECHALLENGE003"" (not including double quotations).

Do note that for the modified RFC Java code, the output would be that of several date/time listed in the testTime[] array, however the targeted GMT from the sample input of the task is also included in here as well. Testing in my Ubuntu showed the same result as that from my Python script.
I believe that I have followed the instructions given by the task. I used the actual RFC given Java code to find it is not generating the same output as the one given in the task. I contacted the provider of the task to ask if there is a bug, but they say that it is correct.
Perhaps I am missing something here, such as the way the task provider actually encrypts the shared key?
","Are you certain the TOTP 1773133250 is correct? Since your secret is only 32 bytes, do you know for sure that the provider that returned the 1773133250 is building the same 64 byte secret you are? 
In your code you take your 32 byte secret and concatenate it together in order to get 64 bytes. 
I am using FusionAuth-2FA Java library, and I get the same result you do if I concatenate your 32 byte secret together to get a 64 byte secret. 
I've read the RFC and it isn't clear to me that there is any requirement for an implementor to expand a secret to a particular byte size. 
It could be your code is correct, and 1773133250 is a red hearing.  
Here is my test code:

","Your function differs from theirs in one respect. You're doing

but they're doing

So your derived key is wrong. You only want to be using hexdigest at the last step of the process, not when calculating the signing key.

","
... what is the difference between EVP and HMAC

EVP_* functions are a high level interface. HMAC_*, AES_* and friends are lower level primitives. You can work with either, but its recommended you work with the EVP_* functions. The HMAC_* routines are software based and don't use hardware.
The EVP_* functions will allow you to easily swap in different hashes and the code essentially remains the same. And you will take advantage of hardware acceleration, like AES-NI for an AES-CMAC, if available.
Here's an OpenSSL example based on https://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/EVP_DigestInit.html.
EVP_MD_CTX* mdctx = NULL;
const EVP_MD* md = NULL;

unsigned char md_value[EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE];
int md_len = 0;

char message[] = ""Now is the time for all good men to ""
    ""come to the aide of their country\n"";

OpenSSL_add_all_digests();

md = EVP_get_digestbyname(""SHA1"");
mdctx = EVP_MD_CTX_create();

if(!EVP_DigestInit_ex(mdctx, md, NULL))
    handleError();

if(!EVP_DigestUpdate(mdctx, message, strlen(message)))
    handleError();

if(!EVP_DigestFinal_ex(mdctx, md_value, &md_len))
    handleError();

if(!EVP_MD_CTX_destroy(mdctx))
    handleError();

printf(""Digest is: "");
for(int i = 0; i < md_len; i++)
    printf(""%02x"", md_value[i]);
printf(""\n"");

Now, and HMAC is slightly different than a Hash. The HMAC is a keyed hash, while the hash is not keyed. You can also use the EVP_* functions for HMAC'ing. Below is from the OpenSSL's wiki page EVP Signing and Verifying:
EVP_MD_CTX* mdctx = NULL;
const EVP_MD* md = NULL;
EVP_PKEY *pkey = NULL;

unsigned char md_value[EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE];   
int md_len = 0;

char message[] = ""Now is the time for all good men to ""
    ""come to the aide of their country\n"";

OpenSSL_add_all_digests();

if(!(mdctx = EVP_MD_CTX_create()))
    handleError();

if(!(md = EVP_get_digestbyname(""SHA1"")))
    handleError();

if(!(pkey = EVP_PKEY_new_mac_key(EVP_PKEY_HMAC, NULL, ""password"", strlen(""password""))))
    handleError();

if(1 != EVP_DigestSignInit(mdctx, NULL, md, NULL, pkey))
    handleError();

/* Call update with the message */
if(1 != EVP_DigestSignUpdate(mdctx, message, strlen(message)))
    handleError();

if(1 != EVP_DigestSignFinal(mdctx, md_value, &md_len))
    handleError();

printf(""HMAC is: "");
for(int i = 0; i < md_len; i++)
    printf(""%02x"", md_value[i]);
printf(""\n"");

The low level interface would look similar to:
EVP_MD_CTX* mdctx = NULL;
const EVP_MD* md = NULL;

unsigned char md_value[EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE];
int md_len = 0;

char message[] = ""Now is the time for all good men to ""
""come to the aide of their country\n"";

OpenSSL_add_all_digests();

md = EVP_get_digestbyname(""SHA1"");
mdctx = EVP_MD_CTX_create();

if(!HMAC_Init_ex(mdctx, key, sizeof(key), md, NULL))
    handleError();

if(!HMAC_Update(mdctx, message, strlen(message)))
    handleError();

if(!HMAC_Final(mdctx, md_value, &md_len))
    handleError();

if(!HMAC_CTX_cleanup(mdctx))
    handleError();

printf(""HMAC is: "");
for(int i = 0; i < md_len; i++)
    printf(""%02x"", md_value[i]);
printf(""\n"");

","
Use ksort() to sort your array before linking your parameters.
Don't use urlencode() to process the vpc_ReturnURL, which would make the SHA256 hash result incorrect. Here is what I found from official Troubleshooting Guide:


c)    Make sure that the vpc_ReturnURL is not URL encoded (i.e. the ""/"" becomes %2f)
      You can use the following link to decode a URL - http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/
      Sample sorted string based on this example as below: (Removed jsessionid, noheader, tdrid from output of 2b) i.e These elements can be removed prior to sorting the order

vpc_AccessCode=A837820A&vpc_Amount=100&vpc_Card=VC&vpc_CardNum=4222222222222&vpc_CardSecurityCode=100&vpc_Command=pay&vpc_Gateway=threeDSecure&vpc_Locale=en&vpc_MerchTxnRef=T2_7956&vpc_Merchant=TESTDIALECTTEST&vpc_ReturnURL=http://anjumpc:8080/dev-pg/payment/3dprocess.do&vpc_Version=1


Don't send/hash the values which keys don't start with vpc_ because MGIS doesn't care about those values and doesn't use those values in hash check. And the guide also mentioned about this:


b)    Remove unnecessary fields for Hash calculation such as vpc_SecureHashType, vpc_SecureHash and anything that does not begins with vpc_ or user_ - i.e fields highlighted in Bold in 2a above to be removed


(Ignore this, the SHA256 can be used on working MIGS merchant)

","The output of hmac is dependent on the hashing algorithm it uses. In your case, it uses sha1, which always output a 20-byte long byte string according to RFC2104.

how to get it in js?
","I suspect that you are running into trouble with types and encoding. According to the CryptoJS source, the iterative hashing style that you are using returns a WordArray once you call finalize(). 
With that, once you go to print the results, you are printing the contents of the WordArray. 
The purpose for itterative hashing is typically if you have a large input, you can break it into chunks to work on one piece at a time. Try the below edit I made that removes this as it does not look like you need to iterate.
function hmac_512(message, secret) {
var newHMAC = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(message, secret);
    return newHMAC;
}

The above will simply return the HMAC in string form which, once Base64 encoded, should match the result you see in Python. 
For a working example, you can check out my Google drive encryption service that uses the cryptoJS HMAC. http://meowcrypt.com/
Hope this helps!

","This is not Private/Public-key cryptography. In such a system, the client would encrypt the whole data and you would then decrypt it using your private key. You would never give your private key to the client.
What you are doing is request signature. You give a ""secret"" (what you are calling ""private key""), then they use this to generate a hash. You can then check the hash on your server since you also know the secret.
There would not be a public key in this kind of system. You normally identify the client using a session key or token, so the client needs to authenticate first (which means you need some authentication method). Essentially, what you are trying to implement is OAuth. Perhaps have a look at the library and see if you can use it directly - http://oauth.net/documentation/getting-started/

","I see 2 issues,

You got key/data reversed. In Ruby, private_key is the key and the salt is the data. In C#, you did the opposite.
If non-ASCII is allowed in any of your strings, you have to make sure you use same encoding. Ruby treats everything as raw bytes so the C# has to match its encoding. If jcode is used, the encoding in C# should match $KCODE.

"10990379","Authorizing a computer to access a web application","I have a web application, and am tasked with adding secure sign-on to bolster security, akin to what Google has added to Google accounts. 
Use Case
Essentially, when a user logs in, we want to detect if the user has previously authorized this computer. If the computer has not been authorized, the user is sent a one-time password (via email, SMS, or phone call) that they must enter, where the user may choose to remember this computer. In the web application, we will track authorized devices, allowing users to see when/where they logged in from that device last, and deauthorize any devices if they so choose.
We require a solution that is very light touch (meaning, requiring no client-side software installation), and works with Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and IE 7+ (unfortunately). We will offer x509 security, which provides adequate security, but we still need a solution for customers that can't or won't use x509.
My intention is to store authorization information using cookies (or, potentially, using local storage, degrading to flash cookies, and then normal cookies).
At First Blush

Track two separate values (local data or cookies): a hash representing a secure sign-on token, as well as a device token. Both values are driven (and recorded) by the web application, and dictated to the client. The SSO token is dependent on the device as well as a sequence number. This effectively allows devices to be deauthorized (all SSO tokens become invalid) and mitigates replay (not effectively, though, which is why I'm asking this question) through the use of a sequence number, and uses a nonce.
Problem
With this solution, it's possible for someone to just copy the SSO and device tokens and use in another request. While the sequence number will help me detect such an abuse and thus deauthorize the device, the detection and response can only happen after the valid device and malicious request both attempt access, which is ample time for damage to be done.
I feel like using HMAC would be better. Track the device, the sequence, create a nonce, timestamp, and hash with a private key, then send the hash plus those values as plain text. Server does the same (in addition to validating the device and sequence) and compares. That seems much easier, and much more reliable.... assuming we can securely negotiate, exchange, and store private keys.
Question
So then, how can I securely negotiate a private key for authorized device, and then securely store that key? Is it more possible, at least, if I settle for storing the private key using local storage or flash cookies and just say it's ""good enough""? Or, is there something I can do to my original draft to mitigate the vulnerability I describe?
","I suspect you are asking for more security than the system, as described, can provide. Put simply, if you can't control the client, it can (mis)use the SSO and device tokens in myriad (unintended) ways, as you are aware. It doesn't matter how well you design the other parts of your system; this is the Achilles heel of your system.
Put another way, in the system as you have described it, you are tasking and trusting the client's web browser to provide its device token and SSO token. Right? If so, how can you prevent the movement of these tokens to other devices? (See mitigation strategies, below.)
Now, to answer your questions head-on with this in mind:

""So then, how can I securely negotiate a private key for authorized 
  device, and then securely store that key?""

It doesn't hurt to do this, but it isn't going to help, as I explain above.

""Is it more possible, at least, if I settle for storing the private key using 
  local storage or flash cookies and just say it's ""good enough""?

I can't tell you what ""good enough"" is. You should clearly communicate the ""moving tokens"" attack and help the customer make an informed decision.

""Or, is there something I can do to my original draft to mitigate the vulnerability I describe?""

There are certainly mitigation strategies that depend on your user install base and your tolerance for risk.
The key question, as I see it -- think about the skills and abilities the kind of person who might move tokens from one machine to another -- can your mitigation strategy make a significant dent in that behavior without degrading the system performance and usability for ""honest"" users?
Here are some ideas:

You could use two factor authentication, such as RSA SecurID. This won't prevent the moving of machine tokens, but it would require that the TFA move with it.
You can try to obfuscate or hide the local copies of these tokens, but this seems like security through obscurity only.
You could check a machine's MAC address. If it is harder to clone a MAC address than move a device token, this might be a useful layer of security.
You could try to require usage of certain customized browsers that ""lock down"" access to these tokens. This is just an idea; I don't know if it is practical.
If you know that machines are not physically supposed to move, you could examine network properties to look for evidence that a machine is in a different network location, and thus, physical location.
If you query and store (on the server, not the client) computer configuration information, you could detect if a token moves from one machine with one configuration to a machine with a different one. (This approach, of course, would complain when a machine gets upgraded.)
Instead of storing local device tokens, you could require the installation of an application that provides an authentication API to the web application. This application could embed itself somewhere on the computer that is hard to hack, root out, or move. (In this way, this application would provide a ""two-factor authentication"" system for the machine.)
In concert with, or separately from the above idea, You could install a separate ""phone home"" application on the device. It would ""check in"" from time to time with your server. If it changes network location, device configuration, or stops responding you could deny access accordingly.

I hope this helps. I don't consider myself a security expert, but I enjoy thinking through design problems. You might get some better responses if you ask over at https://security.stackexchange.com/)

The trick to getting your key into the CSP is to make a struct to hold 3 things: a BLOBHEADER, a DWORD for the length, and char[] for the key.

","Hashing algorithms are deterministic, they must return the same hash for a given input every time.
As long as you use the same key each time then there's no need to make them static. However if you're constructing the HMACSHA1 instance with the parameterless constructor then it generates a random key. You should be taking the random value from the KeyValue property and storing it with the hash.
It is definitely dangerous to use a static instance. If Thread1 sets the value to be calculated, and then Thread2 sets the value before Thread1 calls ComputerHash() then Thread1 is going to get the hash of Thread2's value. The same will happen if either thread is setting the key.

","It worth to know that KeyedHashAlgorithm.ComputeHash() is not thread safe because it give non-deterministic result for the same KeyedHashAlgorithm.Key.
In my case, I want to cache KeyedHashAlgorithm since my KeyedHashAlgorithm.Key is always the same to verify the authenticity from client side. I realize that ComputeHash() is not consistent, probably it cache internal variable into the KeyedHashAlgorithm instance. I should cache the instance per thread ThreadStatic or ThreadLocal. This is the test:
Static KeyedHashAlgorithm gives inconsistent result:
var kha = KeyedHashAlgorithm.Create(""HMACSHA256"");
kha.Key = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(""key"");
Action comp = () =>
{
    var computed = kha.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(""message""));

};
Parallel.Invoke(comp, comp, comp, comp, comp, comp, comp, comp);

Compared to KeyedHashAlgorithm per thread:
ThreadLocal<KeyedHashAlgorithm> tl= new ThreadLocal<KeyedHashAlgorithm>(() =>

    var kha = KeyedHashAlgorithm.Create(""HMACSHA256"");
    kha.Key = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(""key"");

    Console.WriteLine(Convert.ToBase64String(computed));

"5579559","How to implement hash_hmac properly?","Reading this excellent answer about password hashing and wondering how to implement it:
The Wicked Flea wrote:

Generate a nonce for each user; this alone defeats the rainbow table. This is a random number that, depending on the range, expands how many resulting hashes there are.

So beside users' password store a unique token in my database?
The example code in the original post:
function hash_password($password, $nonce) {
  global $site_key;
  return hash_hmac('sha512', $password . $nonce, $site_key);
}

How can i verify a password with this code? Let me explain:
When user submits his password i need to generate it's hash to check for an existing database row where email address and hashed password match. How can i select this row when i know nothing about users' $nonce? Am i missing something? Maybe i need to select user by only his e-mail address then verify the password hash later?
Btw, do you recommend this hashing method?
","I think you have nailed the idea. The same concept is applied in general UNIX-style salted passwords - store salt in clear text with password and retrieve it by username, then use the salt and provided password to produce new hash to be compared to the stored value.
It is up to you to consider wether you trust your DB server (and the connection to it) to use a hashing algorithm that is supported by the DB and let the DB do the math:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'email' AND password = SHA1(CONCAT('cleartextpass',nonce));

Or you could do the math in the code after retrieving all the matching emails.
EDIT: The ThiefMaster comment on differentiating between missing user and invalid password is classical security flaw, which allows attackers to acquire a list of valid usernames and concentrate on breaking their passwords instead of fishing in the darkness. I would strongly recommend against it.

"5781753","Perl code to generate secret key for HMAC SHA256 signing?","I'm planning to use code similar to Amazon AWS samples to authenticate signed API requests. So users will have something like:
use Digest::SHA qw(hmac_sha256_base64);
my $digest = hmac_sha256_base64 ($request, $self->{SecretKey});

and attach $digest as a parameter to their request URI. The server-side will use the same algorithm to create a digest from the client URI and compare that to the value sent by the client.
What I can't find is Perl support for generating the SecretKey of the correct length to use when generating HMAC SHA256 digest. 
For my Amazon AWS account I'm being given a 40 ASCII character base64 encoded string.  
How do I generate a proper secret-key for my clients?
","I suggest you use a PBKDF2 algorithm.  PBKDF2 = ""Password-based Key Derivation Function (#2)"".   It is defined in PKCS #5 (RFC 2898).   This is the recommended way to derive a key from a password.  You will need a salt, as well. A typical iteration count is 1000.  
This page says it has a perl implementation of PBKDF2.  I haven't tried it. 
Apparently there is also a Crypto::PBKDF2, but it is saddled with dependencies you may not want.

I just tried Anthony Thyssen's perl program for pbkdf2 - it works great. Simple, easy.

So the issue is definitely in my signing process. Also, the ""String to be signed"" hex-decoded coming out of that tool is identical to my input policy being signed.

Encode the policy using UTF-8.
Encode those UTF-8 bytes using Base64.
Sign the policy with your Secret Access Key using HMAC SHA-1.
Encode the SHA-1 signature using Base64.

Seems straight-forward enough. The only place for ambiguity might be in #3. The AWS docs show a sample snippet for generating HMAC-SHA1 and this is consistent with other Java cryptography examples I've seen.

"13254907","How can I create a matching HMAC value to verify a Shopify WebHook in .NET?","I have set up an endpoint to receive webhook requests from Shopify.
The requests from Shopify include an HMAC header that is created from a shared secret key and the body of the request.
I need to calculate the HMAC on my server and match it to the value in the request header to ensure that the request is authentic.
I can't seem to create the appropriate mechanism in .NET to create a matching HMAC value.
My algorithm at this point is as follows:
public static string CreateHash(string data)
    {
        string sharedSecretKey = ""MY_KEY"";

        byte[] keyBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(sharedSecretKey);
        byte[] dataBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data);

        //use the SHA256Managed Class to compute the hash
        System.Security.Cryptography.HMACSHA256 hmac = new HMACSHA256(keyBytes);
        byte[] hmacBytes = hmac.ComputeHash(dataBytes);

        //retun as base64 string. Compared with the signature passed in the header of the post request from Shopify. If they match, the call is verified.
        return System.Convert.ToBase64String(hmacBytes);
    }

The Shopify docs for verifying their webhooks can be found HERE but only PHP and Ruby samples are included.
Can anyone see what I might be doing wrong? Should I be just passing the entire JSON request body as a string into this method?
","As an improvement to the above code, you can convert it to an attribute with a few minor changes:
public class VerifyShopifyAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute
{
    private readonly string sharedSecret = ""abc"";

    public override void OnActionExecuting(HttpActionContext actionContext)
    {
        if (!ValidateHash(actionContext))
        {
            // reject the request with a 400 error
            var response = actionContext.Request.CreateErrorResponse(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest, ""Bad Request"");
            actionContext.Response = response;
        }
    }

    private bool ValidateHash(HttpActionContext actionContext)
    {
        var context = (HttpContextBase)actionContext.Request.Properties[""MS_HttpContext""];
        context.Request.InputStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);

        using (var stream = new MemoryStream())
        {
            context.Request.InputStream.CopyTo(stream);
            string requestBody = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(stream.ToArray());

            var keyBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(sharedSecret);
            var dataBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(requestBody);

            //use the SHA256Managed Class to compute the hash
            var hmac = new HMACSHA256(keyBytes);
            var hmacBytes = hmac.ComputeHash(dataBytes);

            //retun as base64 string. Compared with the signature passed in the header of the post request from Shopify. If they match, the call is verified.
            var hmacHeader = HttpContext.Current.Request.Headers[""x-shopify-hmac-sha256""];
            var createSignature = Convert.ToBase64String(hmacBytes);
            return hmacHeader == createSignature;
        }
    }
}

And then you can use it like so for all of your webhooks:
[RoutePrefix(""api"")]
public class ShopifyWebHookController : ApiController
{
    [VerifyShopify]
    [HttpPost]
    public IHttpActionResult HandleWebhook(...)
    {

","Your key contains values greater then the value 127 and, Mac and SecretKeySpec use bytes, which in Java can contain values from -128 to 127.

In the HmacSHA256 algorithm, the key is interpreted as a string of hexadecimal values. In the case of your secret, the decimal values of this key are:
3,147,233,68,238,129,8,187,102,252,159,164,249,159,156,134,36,129,233,224,81,158,24,35,43,166,27,7,103,238,232,198
As you can see, some of them have a value over 127. When creating the SecretKeySpec object and while doing calculations within the Mac class, Java uses byte[] to store this and related sequences. In Java, a byte can contain values from -128 to 127, which means that when storing this secret, the values > 127 will ""flip"" and will make sure the calculations following this will not go as you'd expect.
In the Swift case (and with C++, Ruby, and other languages), the conversion from hex to byte occurs without losing the actual value.

Whilst this is for VB6 (and is native code), it should be straightforward to adapt for use with VBA. As it sounds that you need a worksheet function (i.e. UDF) then you will also need to write this, using the above class.
If you're happy to call .NET assemblies from VBA, then you can simplify your code as most of the calculation work is already done for you (see        System.Security.Cryptography, more specifically HMACSHA256).

"7175067","HMC SHA1 hash - C# producing different hash output than Ruby","I'm trying to quickly get a buggy .Net client library for a third party service I'm using to work. The original library (which works) is written in Ruby, but their equivalent library for DotNet produces differing hash output to the Ruby library.
The Ruby encryption code is as follows:
def self.encrypt_string(input_string)
  raise Recurly::ConfigurationError.new(""Recurly gem not configured"") unless Recurly.private_key.present?
  digest_key = ::Digest::SHA1.digest(Recurly.private_key)
  sha1_hash = ::OpenSSL::Digest::Digest.new(""sha1"")
  ::OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(sha1_hash, digest_key, input_string.to_s)
end

The (supposedly) equivalent C# code is:
private static string ComputePrivateHash(string dataToProtect)
{
    if(String.IsNullOrEmpty(Configuration.RecurlySection.Current.PrivateKey))
        throw new RecurlyException(""A Private Key must be configured to use the Recurly Transparent Post API."");

    byte[] salt_binary = SHA1.Create().ComputeHash(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(dataToProtect));
    string salt_hex = BitConverter.ToString(salt_binary).Replace(""-"", """").ToLower();
    string salt = salt_hex.Substring(0, 20);

    HMACSHA1 hmac_sha1 = new HMACSHA1(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(Configuration.RecurlySection.Current.PrivateKey));
    hmac_sha1.Initialize();

    byte[] private_key_binary = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(salt);
    byte[] passkey_binary = hmac_sha1.ComputeHash(private_key_binary, 0, private_key_binary.Length);

    return BitConverter.ToString(passkey_binary).Replace(""-"", """").ToLower();
}

The actual hash output differs though, given the same input and private key. What is wrong with the C# method that causes it to produce the wrong hash output?
EDIT
This is the way I would have written the code, though it still produces the wrong output:
private static string ComputePrivateHash(string dataToProtect)
{
    if(String.IsNullOrEmpty(Configuration.RecurlySection.Current.PrivateKey))
        throw new RecurlyException(""A Private Key must be configured to use the Recurly Transparent Post API."");

    var privateKey = Configuration.RecurlySection.Current.PrivateKey;
    var hashedData = SHA1.Create().ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(dataToProtect));
    var hmac = new HMACSHA1(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(privateKey));
    var hash = hmac.ComputeHash(hashedData);
    return BitConverter.ToString(hash).Replace(""-"", """").ToLower();
}

CORRECT ANSWER 
Thanks to Henning's answer below, I was able to determine that the correct code is:
var privateKey = Configuration.RecurlySection.Current.PrivateKey;
var hashedKey = SHA1.Create().ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(privateKey));
var hmac = new HMACSHA1(hashedKey);
var hash = hmac.ComputeHash(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(dataToProtect));
return BitConverter.ToString(hash).Replace(""-"", """").ToLower();

","If I understand the code, it seems the Ruby code is hashing the key separately before feeding it to HMAC (which shoudln't be cryptographically necessary, as HMAC will hash a long key itself if necessary), and feeds the hashed key to HMAC together with the original message.
On the other hand, your C# code computes a HMAC with the original key and a hash of the message. (Inexplicably, the variables where you store the hashed message are called salt and private_key_binary, though the content is neither a salt nor a key...)
I cannot imagine that the Ruby and C# libraries would treat HMAC so differently that this is the right thing to do.

What is going wrong please help me ???     
","There is no MD5Init function in OpenSSL.  (There is in the BSD implementation.)
man MD5_Init (note the underscore), or see here.
EDIT:
Now that you've shown us the offending code, I can also help with the ""not a prototype"" message.
You have (edited a bit):
void hmac_md5(text, text_len, key, key_len, digest)
unsigned char*  text;                
int text_len;            
unsigned char* key;                 
int key_len;             
caddr_t digest;              
{
    /* ... */
}

That's an old-style, or ""K&R"", function definition.  It's still valid, but only for backward compatibility, and it means that the compiler won't be able to warn you about calls with the wrong number or type(s) of arguments.  The modern (since 1989) version is:
void hmac_md5(unsigned char *text, 
              int text_len, 
              unsigned char *key, 
              int key_len, 
              caddr_t digest)
{
    /* ... */
}

When converting old-style function declarations and definitions to use prototypes, you sometimes have to be careful about parameters with narrow types (float, and integer types narrower than int or unsigned int) due to the promotion rules.  That doesn't apply in this particular case.
Note that you can leave the definition as it is if you like.  Since you got the code from an internet draft, that might even be a good idea (if it ain't broke, don't fix it) -- but as I said you'll get no help from the compiler if you call it with the wrong number or type(s) of arguments.

","An HMAC is a message authentication code. It is a digest used to verify that a message has not been tampered with, similar to a signature. It is constructed using a one-way hash function, in this case SHA256. It is not an encryption, and it cannot be reversed, therefore the value you have cannot be decrypted.
The only thing you can do with an HMAC is, given the HMAC and the corresponding plain-text, verifying the origin of the plain-text and that it has not been tampered with.
Looking at the GitHub page for the Dart crypto library, it looks like it only supports digest algorithms. There are no encryption algorithms listed, so you will need to use a different library if you want to do two-way encryption which can actually be decrypted. The Cipher library looks like it could be promising in this regard.

Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

dependencies:
  encrypt: ""^0.2.0""

Install it
You can install packages from the command line:
with pub:

$ pub get
with Flutter:
$ flutter packages get
Alternatively, your editor might support pub get or flutter packages get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

Import it
Now in your Dart code, you can use:

I was wondering how to calculate the signature? Is it simply my Secret Access Key?
A shown here on the Amazon Documentation Site.
","NO - Your secret Access key is secret for a reason.  Never pass it over the wire or you'll give any one who sniffs it full access to your AWS Account - they could use it to shutdown all your insances, delete entire S3 Buckets - everything.
The signature is a ""Signed request"".  you take the content of the request and create a Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication code (HMAC) hash using your secret as the hash key.  Since your secret key is only known to You and Amazon, When amazon receives the request they will also take the contents of your request and hash it based on your secret key - if they get the same hash as your signed request then they know the request was not tampered with.  If they are different, then the request may have been maliciously tampered with or compromised so they will reject it.

","First, your “ObjC2” is using SHA1, not MD5 (this means you are probably getting a buffer overrun since SHA1 is 20 bytes, while MD5 is 16 bytes).
Second, I think there is a non-standard variation in your PHP HMAC implementation. Notice how all but the last invocations of md5() are wrapped with a pack(""H*"",…)? All but the last one right before Base64 encoding, that is. I think this means that the PHP code is Base64 encoding the 'printable hex' representation of the data (32 bytes, each a hex digit in ASCII) not the 'raw' value (16 bytes).
Since you cannot change the PHP implementation, you will have to write an HMAC implementation in Objective C that has this same non-standard variation.

My Web API Controller is defined like this:
[SecretAuthenticationFilter(SharedSecretName = ""xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"", HmacSecret = true)]      
public class ProfileController : ApiController
{

    [HttpPost]
    [ResponseType(typeof(Profile))]
    public IHttpActionResult PostProfile(Profile Profile)
    {
        if (!ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            return BadRequest(ModelState);
        }
        GuidValue = Guid.NewGuid(); 

        Resource res = new Resource();
        res.ResourceId = GuidValue;
        var data23 = Resourceservices.Insert(res);

        Profile.ProfileId = data23.ResourceId;
        _profileservices.Insert(Profile);

        return CreatedAtRoute(""DefaultApi"", new { id = Profile.ProfileId }, Profile);
    }

}

Here is some of what SecretAuthenticationFilter does:
//now try to read the content as string
string content = actionContext.Request.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;
var contentMD5 = content == """" ? """" : Hashing.GetHashMD5OfString(content); //<-- Hashing the non-JavaScriptSerialized
var datePart = """";
var requestDate = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-2);
if (actionContext.Request.Headers.Date != null)
{
    requestDate = actionContext.Request.Headers.Date.Value.UtcDateTime;
    datePart = requestDate.ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
}
var methodName = actionContext.Request.Method.Method;
var fullUri = actionContext.Request.RequestUri.ToString();

var messageRepresentation =
    methodName + ""\n"" +
    contentMD5 + ""\n"" +
    datePart + ""\n"" +
    fullUri;

var expectedValue = Hashing.GetHashHMACSHA256OfString(messageRepresentation, sharedSecretValue);

// Are the hmacs the same, and have we received it within +/- 5 mins (sending and
// receiving servers may not have exactly the same time)
if (messageSecretValue == expectedValue
    && requestDate > DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(-5)
    && requestDate < DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(5))
    goodRequest = true;

Any idea why HMAC doesn't work for the POST?
EDIT:
When SecretAuthenticationFilter tries to compare the HMAC sent, with what it thinks the HMAC should be they don't match. The reason is the MD5Hash of the content doesn't match the MD5Hash of the received content. The RestClient hashes the content using a JavaScriptSerializer.Serialized version of the content, but then the PostRequest passes the object as JsonMediaTypeFormatted. 
These two types don't get formatted the same. For instance, the JavaScriptSerializer give's us dates like this:
\""EnteredDate\"":\""\/Date(1434642998639)\/\""
The passed content has dates like this:
\""EnteredDate\"":\""2015-06-18T11:56:38.6390407-04:00\""
I guess I need the hash to use the same data that's passed, so the Filter on the other end can confirm it correctly. Thoughts?
EDIT:
Found the answer, I needed to change the SetupClient code from using this line:
var json = new JavaScriptSerializer().Serialize(content);
contentMD5 = Hashing.GetHashMD5OfString(json);

To using this:
var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(content);
contentMD5 = Hashing.GetHashMD5OfString(json);

Now the sent content (formatted via JSON) will match the hashed content.
I was not the person who wrote this code originally. :)

"14796330","What are the benefits of HMAC over symmetric cryptography?","Somehow I don't get HMACs.
I once asked Why do I need HMACs when we do have public key signatures?, and I think I got this one. Easier to compute, and so on ...
But, what I do not get is why we need HMACs at all, respectively what kind of problem they are solving.
From my understanding, HMACs ...

provide a way to make sure the message has not been tampered,
are ""secured"" by a secret, but symmetric key.

Hence for calculating the HMAC (either initially or for verification) I do need to know the secret key.
Now, if I can exchange this key in a secret way without it being tampared, I could also exchange the message in the very same secret way without it being tampered, don't I?
Okay, now you could argue that you only need to exchange the key once, but you may have multiple messages. That's fine.
But if we now have a secret key that must be kept secret by all parties, we could also directly use symmetric encryption using the very same secret key to encrypt the message, couldn't we?
Of course, an HMAC shall provide a solution against tampering, but if I only have an encrypted message without the secret key and a reasonable encryption algorithm, I can not change that encrypted message in a way that a) decryption still works, and b) a meaningful decrypted message appears.
So what do I need an HMAC actually for?
Or - where is the point that I am missing?
","You're assuming that it is impossible to tamper with an encrypted message without knowing the key used for encryption. This is not the case and a dangerous assumption to make. There are several things possible even if you only have access to the ciphertext:

Corruption of a suffix of the message: this can leak information about the content through error messages, timing and possibly other ways.
Corruption of ranges of the message for some modes (ECB, CFB and possibly others): same as above but the attacker has more ways to trigger the wanted behaviour.
Flipping of arbitrary bits in a single block (not knowing their initial value though) and corruption of the following block (CFB): If some bits are known to the attacker he can set them to the value he wants.
Flipping of arbitrary bits in the whole message for stream ciphers or stream cipher equivalent modes for block ciphers: This can avoid corruption altogether.

Thus it is very important to verify that no attacker tampered with the message before processing even a single byte of the decrypted content. Since there are again some pitfalls in doing this using ad-hoc verification or simple hashing there is a need for MACs of which HMAC is one example.

"9922085","Clarification on HMAC authentication with WCF","I have been following a couple of articles regarding RESTful web services with WCF and more specifically, how to go about authentication in these. The main article I have been referencing is Aaron Skonnard's RESTful Web Services with WCF 3.5. Another one that specifically deals with HMAC authentication is Itai Goldstiens article which is based on Skonnards article. 
I am confused about the ""User Key"" that is referenced to in both articles. I have a client application that is going to require a user to have both a user name and password. 

Does this then mean that the key I use to initialise the
System.Security.Cryptography.HMACMD5 class is simply the users
password?  
Given the method used to create the Mac in Itai's article
(shown below), am I right is thinking that key is the users
password and text is the string we are using confirm that the
details are in fact correct?
public static string EncodeText(byte[] key, string text, Encoding encoding)
{
    HMACMD5 hmacMD5 = new HMACMD5(key);
    byte[] textBytes = encoding.GetBytes(text);
    byte[] encodedTextBytes =
        hmacMD5.ComputeHash(textBytes);
    string encodedText =
        Convert.ToBase64String(encodedTextBytes);
    return encodedText;
}


In my example, the text parameter would be a combination of request uri, a shared secret  and timestamp (which will be available as a request header and used to prevent replay attacks). 
Is this form of authentication decent? I've come across another thread here that suggests that the method defined in the articles above is ""..a (sic) ugly hack."" The author doesn't suggest why, but it is discouraging given that I've spent a few hours reading about this and getting it working. However, it's worth noting that the accepted answer on this question talks about a custom HMAC authorisation scheme so it is possible the ugly hack reference is simply the implementation of it rather than the use of HMAC algorithms themselves. 
The diagram below if from the wikipedia article on Message Authentication Code. I feel like this should be a secure way to go, but I just want to make sure I understand it's use correctly and also make sure this isn't simply some dated mechanism that has been surpassed by something much better. 

","The key can be the user's password, but you absolutely should not do this.

First - the key has an optimal length equal to the size of the output hash, and a user's password will rarely be equal to that.
Second, there will never be enough randomness (entropy to use the technical term) in those bytes to be an adequate key.
Third, although you're preventing replay attacks, you're allowing anyone potentially to sign any kind of request, assuming they can also get hold of the shared secret (is that broadcast by the server at some point or is it derived only on the client and server?  If broadcast, a man-in-the-middle attack can easily grab and store that - height of paranoia, yes, but I think you should think about it) unless the user changes their password.
Fourth - stop using HMACMD5 - use HMAC-SHA-256 as a minimum.

This key should at the very least be a series of bytes that are generated from the user's password - typically using something like PBKDF2 - however you should also include something transitory that is session-based and which, ideally, can't be known by an attacker.
That said, a lot of people might tell you that I'm being far too paranoid.
Personally I know I'm not an expert in authentication - it's a very delicate balancing act - so I rely on peer-reviewed and proven technologies.  SSL (in this case authentication via client certificates), for example, might have it's weaknesses, but most people use it and if one of my systems gets exploited because of an SSL weakness, it's not going to be my fault.  However if an exploit occurs because of some weakness that I wasn't clever enough to identify?  I'd kick myself out of the front door.
Indidentally, for my rest services I now use SCRAM for authentication, using SHA512 and 512 bits of random salt for the stretching operation (many people will say that's excessive, but I won't have to change it for a while!), and then use a secure token (signed with an HMAC and encrypted with AES) derived from the authentication and other server-only-known information to persist an authenticated session.  The token is stateless in the same way that Asp.Net forms authentication cookies are.
The password exchange works very well indeed, is secure even without SSL (in protecting the password) and has the added advantage of authenticating both client and server.  The session persistence can be tuned based on the site and client - the token carries its own expiry and absolute expiry values within it, and these can be tuned easily.  By encrypting client ID information into that token as well, it's possible to prevent duplication on to another machine by simply comparing the decrypted values from the client-supplied values.  Only thing about that is watching out for IP address information, yes it can be spoofed but, primarily, you have to consider legitimate users on roaming networks.

Does the order of salt and secret matters? (salt+secret vs secret+salt)
What should be the shared secret length and what should be the salt length?
Can I use the same secret to also sign messages between the server and the remote service or is it better to generate a separate secret?
Thanks
","You should calculate hmac(salt : userid : timestamp+2hours, secret) and transmit salt : userid : timestamp+2hours : hash.
Purpose of salt here is to make plaintext longer and not repeating, so it better be appended to plaintext, not secret.
If you really want to change secret, do hmac(userid : timestamp+2hours, hash(salt : secret)), it will make one-time secret look more like random number.

Is is enough to create a hash of: public_key using the secret_key?

Put the hash in a hidden field or in the URL as a param together with the public_key (or client_id) and other POST/GET variables.

","The pubkey is just used as an alternative way to recognize the user. It could be the user email as well, by the way since you don't likely want to expose your user data to their programmer (or to potential sniffers) you create a unique identifier for each user. It's all it means. Then you need a private key to sign your hash.
Of course to make it worth it you have to sign all unique request data, otherwise someone could alter your request body and you wouldn't be able to detect it (MITM attack).
You also should care of creating a timestamp that must be included in the HMAC itself, then pass it alongside with the request. This way you can make the signature expirable and so you are not exposed to replay attacks (someone steals the request and without modifying it replies it against the server, operating multiple times the same action... think what a problem if it's a request to pay for your service, your user would be very very angry with you).
Also remember (nobody does) to encrypt also the Request-URI inside the HMAC itself and also the HTTP method (aka verb) if you're using a RESTful webservice, otherwise malicious users will be able to send the request to other URIs or (using RESTful services) change the meaning of your request, so a valid GET can become a potential DELETE.
An example could be: user wants to see all its data, makes a GET request, a Man in the Middle reads the request and changes GET with DELETE. You are not given the opportunity to detect that something has been changed if it's not inside your HMAC you can check about, so you receive a DELETE request and boom! you destroy all user data.
So always remember: everything is essential to your request must be validable
And if you rely on a HMAC then you must encrypt everything you need to trust the request.
Also always remember to start designing your system by denying all request, then if you can validate them perform requested actions. This way you always fall back on denied requests. It's better to have a user email telling you that he cannot do something that have your user data propagated on the net.

"16477737","Java vs Python HMAC-SHA256 Mismatch","Based on recent feedback and findings on this problem, I've rewritten the question to get rid of noise.
I have 2 separate code paths, one in Java (Android), one and Python which accomplish the following for the purposes of negotiating a pairing between an Android device and a Python/Django.
Java:

Generate a syncKey
Hash a concatenated string of various values using the presharedKey (including the syncKey)
Encrypt the syncKey using a presharedKey
Send the Hash, encrypted syncKey, DeviceId and arbitrary variables to web server

Python

Get the presharedKey from the deviceId
Decrypt the encrypted syncKey
Hash a concatenated string of various values using the presharedKey (including the decrypted syncKey)
Make sure the hash matches, which confirms that the syncKey was decrypted successfully, and that the deviceId holds the correct presharedKey.

Now this process works if I send the syncKey unencrypted. The final hash matches, which proves the deviceId has the correct preshared-key, however as soon as I add the en/decryption into the process, the hash no longer matches, despite the fact that both the syncKey and concatenated string appear to match perfectly character for character from the debug output of both Java/Python.
One quirk of the process is that a 256bit key is necessary for the AES256 encryption algorithm, so I'm chopping the 512bit presharedKey in half. The alternative of using only a 256bit key across the board was requiring that I pass the key through encode('ascii') on the python side, or else it was throwing up errors during hashing with the shorter key.

I get the same value you get in Java:

However, that value is probably also wrong. You should almost certainly be hex decoding the input values.
I'm unable to reproduce what you got in Python; one of the values you're passing to hmac.new isn't what you think it is. print them immediately before calling hmac.new and you should see what doesn't match.

I still don't understand how signing every requests stops from a man-in-the-middle atack, since everyone who sees the request and sees the signature, can issue the same request again.
I would also apreciate if someone shared some bibliography about security or amazon web services or web services in general.
How can SSL help in this situation?

Thanks!
","Here's what the documentation has to say.  Basically it boils down to the timestamp, and to mitigate against replay attacks, they suggest using SSL. 

Authenticating Requests
Requests to AWS are authenticated by verifying information contained
  within the request. This verification is performed using the
  information in the following table.

AWSAccessKeyId   The sender’s AWS account is identified by the Access Key ID. The Access Key ID is used to look up the Secret Access Key. 
Signature   Each request to a web service that requires authenticated requests must contain a valid request signature, or the request is rejected. A request signature is
calculated using the Secret Access Key assigned to the developer's account by AWS, which is a shared secret known only to AWS and the developer. 
Timestamp   The date and time the request was created, represented as a string in UTC. The format of the value of this parameter must match the format of the XML Schema dateTime data type.
The second link has this to offer:

The best mechanism for defense against a replay attack is to ensure
  all your requests are made over an SSL connection. If you cannot use
  SSL, then the mechanism available to you for prevention of replay
  attacks is the Expires parameter in signature version 2. This requires
  your client to be synchronized to atomic time (using NTP, or a similar
  synchronization protocol). If you do not use the Expires parameter,
  and rely only on the timestamp parameter, your requests are subject to
  a request expiration period, which varies by service, but can be as
  long as 15 minutes.

In this particular scenario, I am encrypting data on the client side with Crypto-JS and decrypting it back on a python server with PyCrypto.
encrypt.js:
  var password = 'BJhtfRjKnTDTtPXUBnErKDxfkiMCOLyP';
  var data = 'mytext';

  var masterKey = CryptoJS.SHA256(password).toString();

  // Derive keys for AES and HMAC

  );

  var concat = iv + encrypted;

  // Calculate HMAC using iv and cipher text
  var hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(concat, hmacKey);

  // Put it all together
  var registrationKey = iv + encrypted + hash;

  // Encode in Base64
  var basemessage = btoa(registrationKey);

decrypt.py:
class AESCipher:
    def __init__(self, key):
        key_hash = SHA256.new(key).hexdigest()
        # Derive keys
        encryption_key = key_hash[:len(key_hash)/2]

        return True if digest == local_digest else False


    def decrypt(self, enc):
        enc = base64.b64decode(enc)
        iv = enc[:16]
        hmac = enc[60:]
        cipher_text = enc[16:60]

        # Verify HMAC using concatenation of iv + cipher like in js
        verified_hmac = self.verify_hmac((iv+cipher_text), self.hmac_key)

        if verified_hmac:

            return cipher.decrypt(cipher_text)


password = 'BJhtfRjKnTDTtPXUBnErKDxfkiMCOLyP'

input = 'long base64 registrationKey...'

cipher = AESCipher(password)
decrypted = cipher.decrypt(input)

I'm successful in re-calculating the HMAC but when I try and then decrypt the cipher I get something that seems encrypted with �'s in the result.
I was getting errors about input length of cipher text but when I switched to CFB mode that fixed it so I don't think it's a padding issue.
","There are many problems with your code.
Client (JavaScript):

AES has a block size of 128 bit and CFB mode expects a full block for the IV. Use
var iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);

The iv and hash variables are WordArray objects, but encrypted is not. When you force them to be converted to strings by concatenating them (+), iv and hash are Hex-encoded, but encrypted is formatted in an OpenSSL compatible format and Base64-encoded. You need to access the ciphertext property to get the encrypted WordArray:
var concat = iv + encrypted.ciphertext;

and
var registrationKey = iv + encrypted.ciphertext + hash;

registrationKey is hex-encoded. There is no need to encode it again with Base64 and bloat it even more:
var basemessage = registrationKey;

If you want to convert the hex encoded registrationKey to base64 encoding, use:
var basemessage = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(registrationKey).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);

concat is a hex-encoded string of the IV and ciphertext, because you forced the stringification by ""adding"" (+) iv and encrypted. The HmacSHA256() function takes either a WordArray object or a string. When you pass a string in, as you do, it will assume that the data is UTF-8 encoded and try to decode it as UTF-8. You need to parse the data yourself into a WordArray:
var hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(concat), hmacKey);

The CryptoJS.AES.encrypt() and CryptoJS.HmacSHA256() expect the key either as a WordArray object or as a string. As before, if the key is supplied as a string, a UTF-8 encoding is assumed which is not the case here. You better parse the strings into WordArrays yourself:
var encryptionKey = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(masterKey.substr(0, length));
var hmacKey = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(masterKey.substr(length));


Server (Python):

You're not verifying anything in verify_hmac(). You hash the same data with the same key twice. What you need to do is hash the IV+ciphertext and compare the result with the hash (called tag or HMAC-tag) that you slice off the full ciphertext.
def verify_hmac(self, input_cipher, mac):
    # Calculate hash using derived key from local password
    local_hash = HMAC.new(self.hmac_key, digestmod=SHA256)
    local_hash.update(input_cipher)
    local_digest = local_hash.digest()

    return mac == local_digest

And later in decrypt():
verified_hmac = self.verify_hmac((iv+cipher_text), hmac)

You need to correctly slice off the MAC. The 60 that is hardcoded is a bad idea. Since you're using SHA-256 the MAC is 32 bytes long, so you do this
hmac = enc[-32:]
cipher_text = enc[16:-32]

The CFB mode is actually a set of similar modes. The actual mode is determined by the segment size. CryptoJS only supports segments of 128 bit. So you need tell pycrypto to use the same mode as in CryptoJS:
cipher = AES.new(self.key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv, segment_size=128)

If you want to use CFB mode with a segment size of 8 bit (default of pycrypto), you can use a modified version of CFB in CryptoJS from my project: Extension for CryptoJS

Full client code:
var password = 'BJhtfRjKnTDTtPXUBnErKDxfkiMCOLyP';
var data = 'mytext';

var masterKey = CryptoJS.SHA256(password).toString();
var length = masterKey.length / 2
var encryptionKey = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(masterKey.substr(0, length));
var hmacKey = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(masterKey.substr(length));

var iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);

"4635334","PHP Password storage with HMAC+nonce - Is nonce randomness important?","A few years I asked here on stackoverflow about how to make PHP password storage safe.
The main answer suggests using the following hashing algorithm:
function hash_password($password, $nonce) {
  global $site_key;
  return hash_hmac('sha512', $password . $nonce, $site_key);
}

The answer suggests using a random nonce. Is there any advantage in having a random nonce over simple unique nonces?
For instance, each user can have its own ID which does not change. However, let's assume user IDs are sequential(built with MySQL's auto increment feature) and therefore not random. Would the user ID be a good nonce or is randomness important?
Now, each user can pick an username. Each user has its own username which does not change, and two different users can't have the same username.
Usernames are still not random, but they aren't sequential either. Would usernames be good enough as a nonce? Would it be better than using the user ID?
","THIS IS ALL ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT A NONCE IS A SALT... 
If by nonce you mean a salt then yes that requires more rainbow tables to be made. Usually once salt over 20 characters suffices, but for extreme security conditions you would want a new random salt for each password. 
Also good choice in a slow hash http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.hash.php#89574, no sarcasm. But I like ripemd. 
Didnt see the bottom half of your response. To elaborate: Nonces are used to prevent the use of rainbow tables. Whether the ID's would work depends merely on the length of the IDs. Randomness is not technically important, but just makes more rainbow tables required. An example would be, lets say you used a character ""a"" as a nonce and the password were 2 characters long, a rainbow table of a-aa, a-ab a-ac and so on would have to be created. If you use a random one each time maybe all the permutations of 'a' would have to be done + all the permuatations of the other random characters.
But in general making rainbow tables take quite a long time. So if you come up with a salt thats long its likely the rainbow table for it doesnt exists.

","For storing password enough to use:
sha512(salt + password)

salt should be random and unique for each user. Random salt will make precalculated hash tables attack impossible: each user will require his own calculated hash tables. If you'll use not random salt, then chance that precalculated table exists will be higher.
Position salt before password will help to hide hash patterns in case some users have same password.
Nonce is not needed, because it is for prevention a reply attack. This protection is not possible in your architecture.
Using HMAC to prevent collisions is useless, because a) we use hash not for MAC, b) to make probability of collision 50% for SHA-512 you need to calculate about 2^256 values. And 2^256 is truly astronomical number.

","I found that there was a fairly nice tutorial written online about this topic. I don't quite remember where on google I found it but let me see if I can break the function down well enough myself as it is right in front of me...
First the function, it can create a key length of any size. I took the liberty of commenting it fairly heavily...
function pbkdf2($password,$salt,$iter_count = 1500,$key_length = 32,$algorithm = 'sha512') 
{
    /*
      @param string password -- password to be encrypted
      @param string salt -- salt to encrypt with
      @param int iter_count -- number of times to iterate blocks
      @param key_length -- length of key to return
      @param $algorithm -- algorithm to use in hashing

      @return string key
    */

    //determine the length of the hahs
    $hash_length = strlen(hash($algorithm,NULL,TRUE));
    //determine the number of key blocks to compute
    $key_blocks = ceil($key_length/$hash_length);
    //initialize key
    $key = '';

    //create the key itself
    //create blocks
    for($block_count = 1;$block_count <= $key_blocks;$block_count++)
    {
        //initalize hash for this block
        $iterated_block = $block = hash_hmac($algorithm,$salt.pack('N',$block_count),$password,TRUE);
        //iterate blocks
        for($iterate = 1;$iterate <= $iter_count;$iterate++)
        {
            //xor each iterate
            $iterated_block ^= ($block = hash_hmac($algorithm,$block,$password,TRUE));
        }
        //append iterated block
        $key .= $iterated_block;
    }
    //return the key
    return substr($key,0,$key_length);
}


First thing it does is figure out the length of the hash.
Next it determines how many key blocks are required for the key length specified
Then it initializes the hash (key) to return
sets up the for loop that will create each block
takes the initial hash of the block with the block counter in binary appended to the salt
begins the loop to iterate the block $iter_count times (create a hash of itself)
XOR each iterate and append it to $iterated_block (xor previous hash to current)
XOR loop finishes
append $iterated_block to $key for each block
block loop finishes
return the key

I feel this is probably the best way to do this. Maybe I am too paranoid?

I expose an API which requires client to sign requests by sending two headers:
Authorization: MyCompany access_key:<signature>
Unix-TimeStamp: <unix utc timestamp in seconds>

To create a signature part, the client should use a secret key issued by my API service.
In Python (Py3k) it could look like:
import base64
import hmac
from hashlib import sha256
from datetime import datetime

UTF8 = 'utf-8'
AUTH_HEADER_PREFIX = 'MyCompany'

def create_signature(access_key, secret_key, message):
    new_hmac = hmac.new(bytes(secret_key, UTF8), digestmod=sha256)
    new_hmac.update(bytes(message, UTF8))
    signature_base64 = base64.b64encode(new_hmac.digest())
    return '{prefix} {access_key}:{signature}'.format(
        prefix=AUTH_HEADER_PREFIX,
        access_key=access_key,
        signature=str(signature_base64, UTF8).strip()
    )


if __name__ == '__main__':
    message = str(datetime.utcnow().timestamp())
    signature = create_signature('my access key', 'my secret key',  message)
    print(
        'Request headers are',
        'Authorization: {}'.format(signature),
        'Unix-Timestamp: {}'.format(message),
        sep='\n'
    )
    # For message='1457369891.672671', 
    # access_key='my access key' 
    # and secret_key='my secret key' will ouput:
    #
    # Request headers are
    # Authorization: MyCompany my access key:CUfIjOFtB43eSire0f5GJ2Q6N4dX3Mw0KMGVaf6plUI=
    # Unix-Timestamp: 1457369891.672671

I wondered if I could avoid dealing with encoding digest of bytes to Base64 and just use HMAC.hexdigest() to retrieve a string.
So that my function will change to:
def create_signature(access_key, secret_key, message):
    new_hmac = hmac.new(bytes(secret_key, UTF8), digestmod=sha256)
    new_hmac.update(bytes(message, UTF8))
    signature = new_hmac.hexdigest()
    return '{prefix} {access_key}:{signature}'.format(
        prefix=AUTH_HEADER_PREFIX,
        access_key=access_key,
        signature=signature
    )

But then I found that Amazon uses similar approach as in my first code snippet:
Authorization = ""AWS"" + "" "" + AWSAccessKeyId + "":"" + Signature;

Signature = Base64( HMAC-SHA1( YourSecretAccessKeyID, UTF-8-Encoding-Of( StringToSign ) ) );

Seeing that Amazon doesn't use hex digest I stopped myself to move forward with it because maybe they know something I don't.

Update
I've measured a performance and found hex digest to be faster:
import base64
import hmac
import string
from hashlib import sha256


UTF8 = 'utf-8'
MESSAGE = '1457369891.672671'
SECRET_KEY = 'my secret key'
NEW_HMAC = create_hmac()


def create_hmac():
    new_hmac = hmac.new(bytes(SECRET_KEY, UTF8), digestmod=sha256)
    new_hmac.update(bytes(MESSAGE, UTF8))
    return new_hmac


def base64_digest():
    return base64.b64encode(NEW_HMAC.digest())


def hex_digest():
    return NEW_HMAC.hexdigest()



if __name__ == '__main__':

    print(timeit('hex_digest()', number=1000000,
                 setup='from __main__ import hex_digest'))

Results with:
3.136568891000934
2.3460130329913227


Question #1
Does someone know why do they stick to Base64 of bytes digest and don't use just hex digest? Is there some solid reason to keep using this approach over hex digest?
Question #2
According to RFC2716 the format of Authorization header value when using Basic Authentication
is:
Authorization: Base64(username:password)

So basically you wrap with Base64 two values (user's id and password) seprated by colon.
As you can see in my code snippet and in Amazon's documentation nor me, nor Amazon do that for own custom value of the Authorization header.
Would it be a better style to wrap the whole pair as Base64(access_key:signature) to stick closer to this RFC or it doesn't matter at all?
","Amazon does use the hex digest in Signature Version 4.

Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=AKIDEXAMPLE/20150830/us-east-1/iam/aws4_request, SignedHeaders=content-type;host;x-amz-date, Signature=5d672d79c15b13162d9279b0855cfba6789a8edb4c82c400e06b5924a6f2b5d7
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-add-signature-to-request.html

Your example is from Signature Version 2, the older algorithm, which does use Base-64 encoding for the signature (and which also is not supported in the newest AWS regions).
So, your concern that AWS knows something you don't is misplaced, since their newer algorithm uses it.
In the Authorization: header, it really doesn't make a difference other than a few extra octets.  
Where Base-64 gets messy is when the signature is passed in the query string, because + and (depending on who you ask) / and = require special handling -- they need to be url-escaped (""percent-encoded"") as %2B, %2F, and %3D respectively... or you have to make accommodations for the possible variations on the server... or you have to require the use of a non-standard Base-64 alphabet, where + / = becomes - ~ _ the way CloudFront does it.  (This particular non-standard alphabet is only one of multiple non-standard options, all ""solving"" the same problem of magic characters in URLs with Base-64).
Go with hex-encoding.  
You will almost inevitably find would-be consumers of your API that find Base-64 to be ""difficult.""

'When the message integrity check is calculated the signature string should be considered to be sixteen octets of zero.'
Upon recieiving the Access-Request packet I replaced the existing Message-Authenticator with 16 zero bytes then HMAC-MD5 the entire packet and compare the calculated value with the Message-Authenticator in the packet.

","HMAC is a keyed hash.  I don't see the key in your example code.
HashAlgorithm.Create(""HMACSHA256"") creates a HashAlgorithm instance, so it doesn't know anything about a key. It probably just calls this HMACSHA256 Constructor:

public HMACSHA256()
Initializes a new instance of the HMACSHA256 class with a randomly generated key.

You want this constructor:

public HMACSHA256(byte[] key)
Initializes a new instance of the HMACSHA256 class with the specified key data.

If you don't want to to hard-code the HMAC algorithm, you can use KeyedHashAlgorithm.Create and supply a specific key by setting the KeyedHashAlgorithm.Key property.
If you don't want to use a key, then use a non-keyed hash like SHA256.

Using following code I can get them to match. But it feels hacky (use of description and string replacements in iOS side and chomp in Rails):
iOS code:
NSString *secret = @""xxx"";
NSString *data = @""http://someurl?someparams"";

","I am not familiar with Rails, but it seems to me that
hmac = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(OpenSSL::Digest::Digest.new('sha1'), secret.encode(""ASCII""), data.encode(""ASCII""))

computes the digest as a hex string, whereas

CCHmac(kCCHmacAlgSHA1, cKey, strlen(cKey), cData, strlen(cData), cHMAC);
NSData *HMAC = [[NSData alloc] initWithBytes:cHMAC length:sizeof(cHMAC)];

computes the digest as a NSData object, which is just a wrapper for a
sequence of arbitrary bytes.
You probably should change the Rails code to compute the digest as sequence of
bytes as well, instead of a hex string (perhaps using digest instead of hexdigest?)

","If you want to go for JavaScript - there are 2 options:

Use Rhino load() method like:

Use HmacUtils class from Apache Commons Codec from JavaScript 
var rawhmac = org.apache.commons.codec.digest.HmacUtils.hmacSha1(key,data)
var encoded = org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64.encodeBase64String(rawhmac)


However I would recommend going for option 3 - switch to ""groovy"" language instead of JavaScript, that way you will be able to:

Re-use Amazon authentication samples in your test
Get maximum performance and confidence as groovy scripts can be compiled while other languages are interpreted so groovy implementation will take less resources and will work faster.

","I improve Alan's solution using three elements:

factory service that shares the key
controller that sends the httpRequest
httpRequestInterceptor that sets the header

The controller calls a setKey()  provided by a factory service that calculates the header. Finally the httpResponseInterceptor sets the header of request calling getKey() provided by a factory service.
Solved!

","(Apologies for only posting a link instead of an entire solution) have a look at 'Monofraps's angular-node-hmac-example on GitHub (MIT license). 
For Hmac/SHA512 encryption, it uses the (deprecated) CryptoJS library, which I'd probably swap for the Forge cryptographic library (CryptoJS has now been abandoned).

"44420192","HMAC SHA512 using CommonCrypto in Swift 3.1","I'm trying to encrypt data to send to the API.
The API requires the data to be sent as hmac_sha512 encrypted hash.
I've found various examples of how it possibly could have been done for sha1 and others (not sha512) and also in older versions of Swift.
None of the examples that I tried work for swift 3.1
Any help in the right direction will be appreciated.
Edit: 
In PHP, I successfully send it using:
    $sign = hash_hmac('sha512', $post_data, $this->secret);

Edit 2: 
I did add briding header, I don't know what to do next! As the code examples followed after that don't work for swift 3.1 :(
Edit 3:
Solved! Guess what, I was creating briding header incorrectly! :(  
P.S I'm trying to avoid CryptoSwift, focusing on CommonCrypto.
The answer given below is not proper, as it doesn't allow hmac to get a key for encryption. I did research and finally got it working. This post contains the working example project for hmac: https://github.com/nabtron/hmacTest
","I think the best thing to do is using Crypto pod which is a wrapper for common crypto. In case you want to use directly commonCrypto you should add the bridging header to the project and import common crypto using: #import <CommonCrypto/CommonCrypto.h>

    'SECRET_HASH' requires HMAC calculations.

    Does not work if ""Device Tracking"" is turned on.

    'DEVICE_KEY' is needed in AuthParameters. See AuthParameters section.

When I run this I receive the following exception:
botocore.errorfactory.NotAuthorizedException: 
An error occurred (NotAuthorizedException) when calling the InitiateAuth operation: 
Unable to verify secret hash for client <client id echoed here>.

This answer informed me that a SECRET_HASH is required to use the cognito client secret.
The aws API reference docs AuthParameters section states the following:

For REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH/REFRESH_TOKEN: USERNAME (required), SECRET_HASH
  (required if the app client is configured with a client secret),
  REFRESH_TOKEN (required), DEVICE_KEY

The boto3 docs state that a SECRET_HASH is

A keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) calculated using the
  secret key of a user pool client and username plus the client ID in
  the message.

The docs explain what is needed, but not how to achieve this.
","The below get_secret_hash method is a solution that I wrote in Python for a Cognito User Pool implementation, with example usage:

    access_token_public_key = app.config.get('JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_PUB_KEY')

My code is based on AESCrypt implementation in Java, but I wanted to modify it to allow multiple threads to do the job simultaneously.

With this code if I execute only 1 thread, the encryption/decryption goes perfect, but with 2+ threads there is a problem with bytes in the zone between threads jobs, the data gets corrupted there and the checksum also fails.
I'm trying to do this with threads because it gets near 2x faster than with one thread, I think it should be because of processing and not by the accessing of the file.
As a irrelevant data, it compress 250Mb of data in 43 seconds on a MB Air. ¿It's a good time?
","AESCrypt is not thread safe. You cannot use multiple threads with it.
Generally speaking, encryption code is rarely thread safe, as it requires complex mathematics to generate secure output. AES by itself is relatively fast, if you need better speed from it, consider vertical scaling or hardware accelerators as a first step. Later, you can add more servers to encrypt different files concurrently (horizontal scaling).

","You basically want to multithread an operation that is intrinsically sequential.
Stream cipher cannot be made parallel because each block depends on the completion of the previous block. So you can encrypt multiple files in parallel independently with slight performance increase, especially if the files are in memory rather than on disk, but you cannot encrypt a single file using multiple cores.
As I can see, you use an update method. I'm not an expert in Java crypography but even the name of the method tells me that the encryption algorithm holds a state: ""multithreading"" and ""state"" are not friends, you have to deal with state management across threads.
Race condition explains why you get blocks damaged.

    }
}

With this code if I execute only 1 thread, the encryption/decryption goes perfect, but with 2+ threads there is a problem with bytes in the zone between threads jobs, the data gets corrupted there and the checksum also fails.
I'm trying to do this with threads because it gets near 2x faster than with one thread, I think it should be because of processing and not by the accessing of the file.
As a irrelevant data, it compress 250Mb of data in 43 seconds on a MB Air. ¿It's a good time?
","It makes absolutely no sense to use more than 1 thread for the HMAC because 1) it has to be computed sequentially and 2) I/O access R/W is much slower than actual HMAC computation
For AES it can be a good idea to use multiple threads when using CNT mode or other chaining modes which don't require knowledge of previous data blocks.  
what about moving the question to crypto-stackexchange?

"12824108","PHP and Java hmac hash output matches in hex, doesn't match in raw binary. What's happening?","I'm developing a game in Java that will be packaged as an applet, and I'm working on the networking aspect. I've designed a session flow that will work for the frequency of requests and the security needs, without requiring the use of SSL. The data transmission process is loosely based off of the way facebook signs their signed_token used with their OAuth process. Here's the simplified context:

my php/java implementations use hash_hmac/javax.crypto.Mac to generate an obscured signature for signing a payload, based on a shared, secret, unique token and a varied JSON payload
both outputs have to match exactly, because they're part of a larger encode/decode compression scheme
this signature will be passed through URL with the payload, and is used to verify the payload for validity and integrity

As you can infer, if they don't match, then I have dropped packets of data and errors due to invalid data sent. My issue is that, while the hex encoding of the result matches perfectly, the raw binary doesn't seem to ever match. Below are the extracted php and Java test cases I set up:
Note: Because of the differences in how php and java generate the JSON structure for php associative arrays / java hashmaps, I'm using the value of the secret in place of the string payload so that both fields are consistent between platforms.
Php:
$secret = ""922ec205d8e4d0ea06079d60a5336fffd9cf0aea"";
$json = $secret; //json_encode($test_array);
$hmac_a = hash_hmac('sha256',$json,$secret);
$hmac_b = hash_hmac('sha256',$json,$secret,$raw=true); 
echo(htmlentities($hmac_a).""<br/>\n"");
echo(htmlentities($hmac_b).""<br/>\n"");

In-browser output:

ff21a9e468ac49863e5e992324ac8bc92f239a08100b0f329b087be16f5ad382
ÿ!©äh¬I†>^™#$¬‹É/#š2›{áoZÓ‚

Java:
Mac hmac = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA256"");
SecretKeySpec secret_key = new SecretKeySpec(Charset.forName(""UTF-8"").encode(this.secret).array(), ""HmacSHA256"");
hmac.init(secret_key);
byte[] digest = hmac.doFinal(this.secret.getBytes(""UTF-8""));
System.out.println(hexify(digest));
System.out.println(new String(digest,""UTF-8""));

Console output:

ff21a9e468ac49863e5e992324ac8bc92f239a08100b0f329b087be16f5ad382
�!��h�I�>^�#$���/#� 2� {�oZӂ

When copied to php and told to echo, that second string looks like this:

:ï¿½!ï¿½ï¿½hï¿½Iï¿½>^ï¿½#$ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½/#ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½2{ï¿½oZÓ‚

Note that while the hex is identical, the binary is different, but contains the same ending ( oZÓ‚ ) when displayed from the same source. Actually, it contains all of the more common characters (!hI>^#$/#2{oZÓ,) in order. I played around with copying the console output to php then displaying as a binary string, regular string, utf8_encode'd binary/regular string, and also utf8_encode'ing $hmac_b. Nothing seems to make the raw versions match up.
I've run mb_detect_encoding on php's hmac, and it told me UTF-8. I've also set everything in javax.crypto.Mac to UTF-8, and displayed as UTF-8, but no dice. I know Java's UTF-8 isn't different than php's UTF-8, because that defies the concept of having standard character sets. What's going on here?
Note: While I now prefer and am able to use the hex version for URL encoding, I'd still like to know what's going on with this character set nonsense, and possibly how to fix it.
","I'm no Java expert, but it looks like you're doing two different things...
You are using htmlentities() in PHP, which is converting characters like ÿ to &yulm;, whereas your Java snipped is trying to dump out UTF-8 data.
Why are you actually expecting valid UTF-8 data after a HMAC? UTF-8 is for representing Unicode characters, not random hashes.
Using this in PHP:
$secret = ""922ec205d8e4d0ea06079d60a5336fffd9cf0aea"";
$json = $secret;
$hmac_a = hash_hmac('sha256',$json,$secret);
$hmac_b = hash_hmac('sha256',$json,$secret,$raw=true); 
echo $hmac_a . ""\n"";
echo $hmac_b . ""\n"";

I get the following (in a UTF-8 aware terminal):
ff21a9e468ac49863e5e992324ac8bc92f239a08100b0f329b087be16f5ad382
�!��h�I�>^�#$���/#2{�oZӂ

This is entirely expected. $hmac_b is effectively binary being interpreted as UTF-8, so it will be full of invalid UTF-8 sequences. Don't expect it to be characters. You will be better looking at it in as ISO-8859-1 output, which isn't multibyte:
ff21a9e468ac49863e5e992324ac8bc92f239a08100b0f329b087be16f5ad382
ï¿½!ï¿½ï¿½hï¿½Iï¿½>^ï¿½#$ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½/#ï¿2ï¿{ï¿½oZÓ

(There's also a control character on the end of that output \x82)
The point is, you're comparing apples with oranges in pear packaging.

"28966075","Creating a HMAC signature for AWS REST query in C#","So I'm trying to do a REST API call to AWS' SNS service, but I keep getting an IncompleteSignature error. I based myself on http://www.jokecamp.com/blog/examples-of-creating-base64-hashes-using-hmac-sha256-in-different-languages/#csharp on how to create the signature and http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/HMACAuth.html to find out what to sign.
Here's the test code I came up with:
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string region = ""us-west-2"";
        string msg = ""This is a test!"";
        string secret = ""XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"";
        string key = ""XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"";
        string arn = ""arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:xxxxxxxxxx:snstest1"";

        string query = ""Action=Publish&Message="" + HttpUtility.UrlEncode(msg) + ""&MessageStructure=json&TargetArn="" + HttpUtility.UrlEncode(arn) + ""&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&AWSAccessKeyId="" + key + ""&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp="" + HttpUtility.UrlEncode(DateTime.UtcNow.ToString(""o""));
        string tosign = ""GET\nsns."" + region + "".amazonaws.com\n/\n"" + query;

        System.Text.ASCIIEncoding encoding = new System.Text.ASCIIEncoding();

        byte[] keyByte = encoding.GetBytes(secret);
        byte[] messageBytes = encoding.GetBytes(tosign);

        var hmacsha256 = new HMACSHA256(keyByte);

        byte[] hashmessage = hmacsha256.ComputeHash(messageBytes);
        query += ""&signature="" + HttpUtility.UrlEncode(Convert.ToBase64String(hashmessage));

        Console.WriteLine(""REST Call: https://sns."" + region + "".amazonaws.com/?"" + query);
    }

Any idea what might be wrong?
EDIT: I tried changing the signature part with the code from http://wiki.alphasoftware.com/~alphafiv/DotNet+Example%3A+Digital+Hash it uses CharArray instead of the byte[], not sure which is right, it produces a different signature but it still doesn't work with AWS.
EDIT2: After long tries I finally figured out that AWS expects Signature= and not signature=, but now I'm getting a SignatureDoesNotMatch error, so I need to figure that out next. Also I don't know why this kind of question would get downvoted. Once I figure out the syntax, an AWS API call would be trivial to do in any app. If you use the AWS .NET SDK you're adding 6 megs to your binary. How is that not a worthwhile endeavor?
SOLUTION:
This code works and will send a SNS notification without the AWS SDK:
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string region = ""us-west-2"";
        string msg = ""Test test: sfdfds\nfsd: sdsda\n"";
        string secret = ""XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"";
        string key = ""ZZZZZZZZZZZ"";
        string arn = ""arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:YYYYYYYYYYY:snstest1"";

        string query = ""AWSAccessKeyId="" + Uri.EscapeDataString(key) + ""&Action=Publish&Message="" + Uri.EscapeDataString(msg) + ""&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&TargetArn="" + Uri.EscapeDataString(arn) + ""&Timestamp="" + Uri.EscapeDataString(System.DateTime.UtcNow.ToString(""yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ""));
        string tosign = ""GET\nsns."" + region + "".amazonaws.com\n/\n"" + query;

        Console.WriteLine(tosign + ""\n"");

        UTF8Encoding encoding = new UTF8Encoding();
        HMACSHA256 hmac = new HMACSHA256(encoding.GetBytes(secret));
        string signature = Convert.ToBase64String(hmac.ComputeHash(encoding.GetBytes(tosign)));

        query += ""&Signature="" + Uri.EscapeDataString(signature);

        Console.WriteLine(""REST Call: https://sns."" + region + "".amazonaws.com/?"" + query);
    }

","There is nothing wrong with rolling your own solution rather than using the SDKs.  In fact, I prefer it, because in addition to more lightweight code, you are more likely to understand problems with unexpected behavior because you are working with the native interface.
Here's what you are missing:

Add the query string parameters ... sorted using lexicographic byte ordering
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-2.html

For example, TargetArn should not be before SignatureMethod.  They all need to be sorted.  There is only one possible correct signature for any given message, so the sort order is critical.

The hashing file I have been using can be found at Fundamentals on SourceForge. It is the one at the bottom called Fundamentals Hash 4.00.15
The reason I have been using this file is a very simple one, it seems to be the only one giving me a correct answer. Or should I say, it is giving me the correct answer compared to the result this Hashing Website is giving me.
I've tried using the Indy components to generate the correct hash, but it never seems to match the value from the website. Maybe I'm not using it correctly or the right libraries or something, but I will add the example for that as well that I created.
(As I write this, I've just tested again, and it does seem like I am getting the right answer, go figure, maybe I am using a better OpenSSL library. Anyway, I will also put my INDY example down below as well).

I finally moved on when I worked out the custom HTTP headers and am now getting

Could it be something simple as an invalid nonce, or one that is too old?

TypeError: key: expected bytes or bytearray, but got 'str'

from hmac.py. I've of course tried converting self.Secret and message using bytes() and bytearray(), but that hasn't worked either.
I've also tried using hashlib.sha512 to generate the key, but that's not very clear to me. I have a secret API key that needs to be used to sign the POST data and the only clear way to do this is using hmac.new(), but when I finally do get something that can be passed as a string it looks nothing like it should, and as expected I can't authenticate with it.
Another attempt was:
sign = hashlib.sha512(message_to_sign)
sign.update(self.Secret.upper())

This also produces a string that looks nothing like the working key that comes from the original code in Python 2.7.
I've tried so many other variations as well, but none of them give me anything that works.
","hmac hashing works with binary keys and data. In python2, str is a sequence of 8 bit characters which is interchangable with binary so everything works. In python3, str is a sequence of unicode characters and must be encoded to binary to work. This should work:
return hmac.new(bytes(self.Secret.upper().encode('ascii')) , bytes(message.encode('ascii') , hashlib.sha512).digest().encode(""base64"").replace(""\n"","""")

Notice I used ascii encoding but that's just a guess. Your python2 strings may be your local code page and your message may be a binary blob already. You'll need to formalize what encoding you use so that receivers know how to verify the signature.

"30405598","HMAC Authentication using Django - Shared Secret","I am implementing a web service using Django for a mobile app. I decided to use Hash-MAC to authenticate requests (no Oath, no https) but the challenge is what should i use as shared secret key?
First i considered using The user's password but it required to store passwords in plain text in server-side database. The other solution that came to my mind was salting and hashing password in mobile app just the way that django auth app does in order to compute hashed password in client side. 

What does Django use as salt? Are they ""secret""? Is there any problem with sending them as plain-text to users? We don't have to keep salts as ""secret""s in general, but Django may use something that should be kept secret as salts, i don't know, it is about how django implemented this.
Users have to know their salts to compute hashed password so server should provide them with it. An adversary can ask for all users salts and eventually (s)he can have all the salts (Even if there is a limit to the number of times someone can ask for this in a certain time period). Even though salts are not secret but i guess knowing ""all"" of them can be dangerous. (or maybe i am overly concerned about security!)

Requests format:
HTTP request header:
x-mac-digest: 1d186b9c0fd5cd393f23623f0d167f7b17ac7d1cd74d8442647991d61e756c19

HTTP request body:
{
  ""username"": ""mjafar"",
  ... rest of request in json
}

Authenticating request (simplified):
hash_digest = request.META['HTTP_X_MAC_DIGEST']
request_body = request.body.decode('utf-8')
request_json = json.loads(request_body)

user = UserModel.objects.get(username=request_json['username'])
sharedKey = getSharedKey(user)  # What should it return?

hash = hmac.new(sharedKey, request_body, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
if hash != hash_digest:
    return HttpResponseBadRequest('MAC authentication failed')

","HMAC is used to authenticate a block of messages. It's used to verify block of cipher/Text was not changed during the transmission. You will need to use asymmetric encryption (RSA, DH,..etc) to transfer your shared key.    
Using a plain text without using digital signature is useless. You will be vulnerable to MITM attack. Unless you manage to put the shared secret on the mobile app without internet (GSM SIM cards have shared key inside the sim itself and it's used to encrypt GSM calls).
Django uses random function to generate its secret_key. Random function on Linux will call /dev/urandom, on windows will call what's equivalent to that.
In your case, create a rest api to create a username and password, then return a hash value to be used to access your views.
If you want to compute a custom hash value, you can call make_password function, and save it directly in the password attribute in User
Read this: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/auth/passwords/ 
Example: Django make_password too slow for creating large list of users programatically

"39892167","Node Hmac Authentication","My understanding of the authentication process. The host creates a secret and a public api key. The client is crypting the payload with the help of the secret, this is the signature. Then sends its public key, payload, signature to the host.
Example client
The host checks if the public key is allowed to do an operation and gets the secret according to the clients public key. With the help of the secret the host decrypts the signature and compares it to the payload.
Question

Is the above process described correctly?
How to decrypt the signature and compare it to the payload?
Or am I supposed to crypt it in the same way as the client dos and compare it then?
What exactly do the two steps update & digest Node Docs

Client:
  authenticate: (self)->
    payload = 'AUTH' + moment()
    signature = crypto.createHmac('sha384', WEBSOCKET_SECRET)
      .update(payload)
      .digest('hex')

    data = {
      event: 'auth',
      apiKey: WEBSOCKET_KEY,
      authSig: signature,
      authPayload: payload
    }
    self.send self, data

Server:
hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha384', WEBSOCKET_SECRET)
hmac.on 'readable', () ->
  data = hmac.read()
  if (data)
    console.log data, data.toString('utf-8')


# hmac.write(authPayload)
hmac.write(signature)
hmac.end()

Current Server Side Solution
  authenticate: (authPublicKey, authSignature, authPayload)->
    signature = crypto.createHmac('sha384', WEBSOCKET_SECRET)
      .update(authPayload)
      .digest('hex')

    return authSignature == signature

","HMAC isn't use to encrypt/decrypt, is just use for authentication and check of data integrity.
Client send his payload, his pk, and the hmac of his payload with his secret key.
Server retrieve user with his pk, recompute the hmac with the retrieved sk and then check if the computed hmac is equal to the retrieved hmac.
Client has a public key, and secret key :
var str        = payload_string;
var public_key = pk;
var secret_key = sk;

var hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha384', sk).update(str).digest('hex');

request.post({uri:..., json: { hmac, public_key, payload: str }, function(err, response, body) {
   console.log(body);
});

On server :
exports.... = function(req, res)
{
   var hmac = req.body.hmac;
   var pk = req.body.public_key;
   var payload  = req.body.payload;


   // retrieve authorized user
   User.findOne({ pk }, function(err, user) {
      if(err || !user){
        return res.status(403).json({error:""Invalid user""});
      }

      // recompute hmac
      var compute_hmac= crypto.createHmac('sha384', user.sk).update(payload).digest('hex');

      // check hmac

I may be using the term/acronym ""HMAC"" too loosely, but what I mean is that each request to my API should include a header that includes a hash that was calculated by the client by hashing parts of the request (including a timestamp) with a shared secret. The server then calculates this same hash with the same ingredients from the request, and determines if the request is valid and should be responded to.
This works well enough, but now I would like to use Varnish to cache my API responses. The nature of HMAC requires that each request calculates the hash to verify the user is who they are, but the actual response that is returned is the same - so the meat of the API call is very much cacheable.
What I'd like (and I'm assuming this can be achieved, I just don't know HOW) is to pass the authentication task to the backend, somehow tell Varnish ""yes, go ahead and respond to this request"" or ""no, don't respond to this request"" and then from there let Varnish determine if the request can be served from cache or not. 
Even more ideally, would be to do something slightly fancier, and allow Varnish to handle the authentication itself, or pass the HMAC processing onto something faster then the backend. For example, the API might store the client secret/public key in a redis cache, then Varnish might actually calculate the hash itself using the values from Redis. 
","You should be able to implement the fancier solution in Varnish VCL code (Varnish Configuration Language) by using two Varnish Modules:

Redis vmod to fetch keys.
Varnish Digest Module for calculating/processing HMAC.

Both modules are used in production, as listed in the modules directory.
If Varnish handles the authentication in VCL, you can let Varnish cache your API backend response and deliver it only for authenticated requests.
If the HMAC implementation requires the request body:
As Gridfire points out in his/her answer, Varnish cannot access the request body. And we can/should not send the full request body in a HTTP header from the backend/application. 
But, we can send a hash/digest of the full request body in a HTTP header. Calculation of the hash on the backend should be negligible compared to generating the output(markup|data|whatever).
AFAICT there should be no cryptological/practical downsides to this method as long as the hash/digest and HMAC is robust, and the digest is lengthy (256bits or more). Performance testing is adviced as usual.

","Varnish can easily do HMAC using the VMOD's in Geir Bostad answer, unless your HMAC implementation uses the request body as part of the hash.
Varnish does not give you access to the request body, libvmod-bodyaccess provides some functions but I have found no way of actually getting the request body.
You could theoretically add a header containing the request body, but this is pretty bad practice and will either bloat your HTTP requests with redundant data, or break HTTP request standards if you choose to only put the data in the header. Simply put not recommended.
An alternate solution would be to use Nginx, which can also act as an SSL terminator if you want to use HTTPS (Varnish doesn't do SSL).
Nginx has a module to run Lua scripts (Ubuntu/Debian package nginx-extras provides it without requiring you to compile it yourself), and the module brings the handy access_by_lua_file directive to allow or block access based on the result of the script.
There's a HMAC script for Nginx here.

"9897023","asymmetric HMAC","validation of HMAC generated hash requires the key to be known to the validator. So its symmetric. What is the similer asymmetric solution other than SSL ? as I want the signature be smaller like an md5 hash. and the generation and validation procedure to be light. I was going through Rabin's Signature algorithm but couldn't find any Implementation or pseudo code ro follow.
","The smallest asymmetric signatures come from elliptic curce cryptosystems like ECDSA. ECDSA signature schemes require signatures approximately four times the length of a symmetric cipher key of equivalent security. So a scheme comparable in security to 128-bit AES would have 512-bit signatures. That's the state of the art right now -- schemes with smaller signatures but equal or greater security are not known.
If you don't need security quite that high, you could use a 192-bit curve which would result in 384-bit signatures. You can go down to 320-bit signatures (160-bit curves) and still have security comparable to 80-bit symmetric ciphers. If you really don't particularly care about security, 112-bit curves can be used, providing 224-bit signatures that are about as difficult to break as DES.
The following curves are what I would recommend for each security level:
SecP112R1: 224-bit signatures, 56-bit security level
SecP128R1: 256-bit signatures, 64-bit security level
SecP160K1: 320-bit signatures, 80-bit security level
SecP192K1: 386-bit signatures, 96-bit security level
SecP224K1: 448-bit signatures, 112-bit security level
SecP256K1: 512-bit signatures, 128-bit security level
For each curve, the private key is the same size as the curve. Public keys (in compressed form) are one bit larger than the curve size. Signatures are twice the curve size. So with SecP256K1, private keys are 256-bits, public keys are 257-bits, and signatures are 512-bits. These are the minimum sizes for the raw binary values.
Caution: I would consider 160-bit curves the minimum for any purpose where security is a factor. Smaller curves might be suitable if keys are generated, used, and then thrown away in a small time frame. For long-term security, 256-bit curves should be used. The system as a whole should be evaluated by competent experts before it is relied upon.

"14820558","HMAC with ASP.NET WebAPI using Cuong's Solution","I spent a some time today looking through various HMAC implementations in C# for an upcoming WebAPI project. I wanted to start out with some existing code just to see it all work and understand it better before I either wrote it from scratch or modified it for my needs. 
There are a bunch of great articles and posts both here and on the web. However, I have gotten to the point that I need some pointers and would greatly appreciate some insight. 
I started with Cuong's post here: How to secure an ASP.NET Web API.
I knew I would have to expand upon it since I wanted to support both json and formencoded data. My test client is also written in C# using HttpClient and I spun up an empty WebAPI project and am using the ValuesController.
Below are my observations and questions:

POSTing: In order to get Cuong's code to work (validate successfully), my POST needs to include the parameters in the URL, however in order to get the values to my controller, I need to include them in the body. Is this normal for this type of authentication? In this particular instance, the message I am hashing is http://:10300/api/values?param1=value1&param2=value2. Now I can parse the query string manually to get them, however in order to get the value to my controller through binding, I must also:
var dict = new Dictionary<string, string>
                   {
                       {""param1"", ""value1""},
                       {""param2"", ""value2""}
                   };
var content = new FormUrlEncodedContent(dict);

var response = await httpClient.PostAsync(httpClient.BaseAddress, content);


Otherwise my parameter is always null in the post action of the ValuesController.

I am planning on expanding the code to include a nonce. Between the combination of a nonce, a timestamp and the verb, is that enough for a secure hash? Is there really a need to also hash the message?
I tried (very unsuccessfully) to extend the code to support json as well as form encoded data and I must be missing something obvious.
Cuong is using the Authentication and Timestamp headers instead of putting the signature and timestamp in the query string. Is there a benefit to one method over the other? The majority of articles I have read have them in the query string itself.

The code looks great and I am a little out of my element here. I might be safer (saner?) just writing it from scratch to appreciate the nuances of it. That said, if anyone can lend some insight into what I am seeing that would be great.
At the end of the day, I want to be able to use the built in authorization mechinism of the WebAPI framework to simply attribute the methods/controllers, be able to accept form encoded and json data and reasonably model bind for complex types.
* Update *
I have done some more work today and below is the code from my nUnit PostTest. I figured out how to get the values through without both including them in the body and the query string (code below).
[Test]
    public async void PostTest()
    {
        using (var httpClient = new HttpClient())
        {
            var payload = new FormUrlEncodedContent(new Dictionary<string, string>
                       {
                           {""key1"", ""value1""},
                           {""key2"", ""value2""}
                       });

            var now = DateTime.UtcNow.ToString(""U"");
            httpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri(string.Format(""http://ipv4.fiddler:10300/api/values""));
            httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(""Timestamp"", now);
            httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(""Authentication"", string.Format(""test:{0}"", BuildPostMessage(now, httpClient.BaseAddress, await payload.ReadAsStringAsync())));

            var response = await httpClient.PostAsync(httpClient.BaseAddress, payload);

            await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

            Assert.AreEqual(true, response.IsSuccessStatusCode);

        }
    }

I also figured out the model binding portion of it. There is a great article here: http://www.west-wind.com/weblog/posts/2012/Mar/21/ASPNET-Web-API-and-Simple-Value-Parameters-from-POSTed-data that explains how POST works and I was able to get it to work with both a model of my own design as well as with the FormDataCollection object.
Now I am left wondering whether or not it is worth adding json encoded messages or if standardizing on FormUrlEncoding is the way to go. Also, are client nounce's enough or should I implement a server side nounce? Does a server side nounce double all of the calls to the service (first one throws a 401, second one includes the payload with the nounce?

","It is really hard to answer your question in a short manner, since implementing a full blown OAuth client is not trivial and requires really understanding the OAuth1.0a specification. It is not rocket science but it really requires sorting out all the bits and pieces.
I will attempt to answer your question piecemeal.

What are base strings?

A signature base string in OAuth is built like this:

Start with the HTTP method of the request your are sending, in upper case. E.g POST or GET. 
Add an ampersand (&) character to that
Add the URL encoded (percent encoded) URL you are calling in your request (do not include parameters here)
Add yet another ampersand (&) character here
Lastly add the URL encoded parameter string

I'll describe how to create the parameter string you need in that last step.
Gather all the parameters included in the request. You'll find them either in the URL as part of the query string and also in the request body when you are POST-ing requests. Say for example that you are POST-ing the parameter parameter1=value1 to the URL http://example.com/?parameter2=value2. That makes two parameters to include.
Now you also have to sum up all the OAuth parameters that are needed for the protocol to be happy. These would lead to a parameter list looking something like this:

oauth_consumer_key=fffffaaaafffaaaff
oauth_nonce=aaaaabbbbbcccccaaaaudi2313
oauth_signature_method=HMAC-SHA1
oauth_timestamp=1319633599
oauth_token=bbbbbbbbbfsdfdsdfsfserwerfsddffdsdf
oauth_version=1.0
parameter1=value1
parameter2=value2

All these individual strings need to be lexicographically sorted on the parameter name (alphabetically should suffice), and concatenated into a string. That's your parameter string.

Am I right on the spaces->%20 example?

Yes. You are talking about percent encoding, which also goes by the name of HTTP encoding and URL encoding. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding.

HMAC-SHA1 involves a message and a key, is the consumer secret the message? Is the consumer key the key then?

The message is the signature base string that you created above. And the key is the combination of your consumer secret and your access token secret. So the key should look like this: CONSUMER_SECRET&TOKEN_SECRET (notice the ampersand). In the absolute first request that you do you will not have a token secret yet, then the key is only CONSUMER_SECRET& (again, notice the ampersand).

How to create a signature through the use of the HMAC-SHA1 algorithm.

I fetched this from http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/csharp/OAuthBase.cs and the secrets and the base string are assumed to be available to the code.
Basically feed an HMACSHA1 instance with a key and a message, render that hash and convert it to a base64 string.
HMACSHA1 hmacsha1 = new HMACSHA1();
hmacsha1.Key = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(string.Format(""{0}&{1}"", UrlEncode(consumerSecret), string.IsNullOrEmpty(tokenSecret) ? """" : UrlEncode(tokenSecret)));
byte[] dataBuffer = System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(signatureBaseString);
byte[] hashBytes = hmacsha1.ComputeHash(dataBuffer);

return Convert.ToBase64String(hashBytes);


If I do manage to create the signature, how do I pass these values to Twitter?

You should easily be able to research what an HTTP header is.
But you can choose to add the final result of the parameters and signature to the URL, I think Twitter even accepts them in the request body on some requests. But the preferred way is through the Authorization HTTP header since it allows for clear separation between protocol specific and request specific parameters. 
It should look somewhat like this (taken straight from the OAuth 1.0a spec): 
Authorization: OAuth realm=""Example"",
    oauth_consumer_key=""0685bd9184jfhq22"",
    oauth_token=""ad180jjd733klru7"",
    oauth_signature_method=""HMAC-SHA1"",
    oauth_signature=""wOJIO9A2W5mFwDgiDvZbTSMK%2FPY%3D"",
    oauth_timestamp=""137131200"",
    oauth_nonce=""4572616e48616d6d65724c61686176"",
    oauth_version=""1.0""

    - (NSString *) encodeWithHmacsha1:(NSString *)k0:(NSString*)m0
{

But my actually question is there any way I can test these methods locally and not up gainst the webservice - so I can rule out errors from the wbservice.

","In order to test your key hashing methods you will need to establish a known set of test data. That way you know what the expected output will be based on some matching input. You can get a lot of different standard test data from RFC2202
Testing your implementations would therefore be easily handled by a few unit tests which compares these well-known data sets.
If you want to test that you are actually encoding the query to the webservice and handling the response correctly you could look into some kind of stub or mock testing. Again you will need to establish a known set of input data and expected output.
Once you have this reference test set you can implement a custom NSURLProtocol which will act as the real webservice but instead provide you with the ""reference"" response. I have a detailed description of this topic on my blog:

","You could modify your method slightly so that instead of creating an NSData containing the digest bytes, you could create a string formatting the bytes as hexadecimal.

For this reason I want the app to use an external database on a cloud service through a REST API build using the Zend Framework. I researched on how to build a secure REST API, many resources pointed out using a HMAC for authentication. The part that leaves me a little confused is where should the secret key be generated and how should it be shared with both the server and the client?
Is every individual client (As in every user of the app) supposed to get a unique secret key?
If not, I imagine I could do something like this:

Generate Secret key for (e.g.) iOS devices on the server.
Hard code the key in the app
With every request a HMAC is send hashing the secret key, some data and the user id.
I check the user id in the HMAC with the user id send in normal JSON, and if the secret keys match.
execute whatever the user request the user send.

Whenever a third party service would like to use my rest API, I would need to generate a separate secret key specifically for that service.
If every user has to generate a separate secret key, then I have no idea on how I would transfer the key to the server without the risk of a man-in-the-middle attack..

I'm trying to query the GDAX API and am also using the code as given on their API page. Being written for Python2.7, I figured there might be issues with encoding and all, but this is just not making sense to me.

","The issue is that without a timestamp any signed message is valid forever. If an attacker managed to capture a message they could replay it infinitely even without compromising your secret used to sign the message.
If you add a timestamp then a message will expire after a short time and prevent this. You would chose how long to honor timestamps for in the server application.

"26915864","How can I create a signature for AWS in Javascript?","I am trying to create the signature for AWS Mechanical Turk, using Node.js, but am having trouble doing so.  At the moment I am using the following, but keep getting errors:
CryptoJS.HmacSHA1(service + operation + timestamp, process.env.SECRET_ACCESS_KEY); 

The explanation of the signature is at this link.  It states that to create a signature

A request signature, an HMAC, is calculated by concatenating the
  values of the Service, Operation, and Timestamp parameters, in that
  order, and then calculating an RFC 2104-compliant HMAC, using the
  Secret Access Key as the ""key."" The computed HMAC value should be
  base64 encoded, and is passed as the value of the Signature request
  parameter. For more information, go to
  http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2104.html.

If the end user uses a weak shared key and sends a lot of short messages, I assume there would be risk of an attacker discovering the key.
My intuition says I should append a unique (per message) salt to the key to make reverse-engineering the key harder.
How much would key salting help, and would I gain anything by also salting the messages?
","Normally people salt the key. It does increase security, both because it makes reverse-engineering the key harder, and because the same message does not always have the same MAC, so an attacker can't simply re-send a message that was sent earlier with the same MAC.

"17793194","Python HMAC-SHA256 signature differs from PHP signature","I searched and found a few questions that sort of addressed what I am trying to accomplish, but I can't seem to quite put my finger on this. I'm new to programming and am trying to replicate a bit of code that's available to me by the vendor in a handful of languages (PHP, Ruby, Perl, C#).  I've taken the PHP code and tried my best to replicate it in Python and have gotten everything working except this signature function.  Basically, I have to take an array of data that's being passed in by a user via web form, sign it, and send it to the web services listener to process.  Try as I might, I can't get the signature values to match. The vendor unfortunately does not provide code-level support for anything other than their samples, so I'm out of luck there.  Here's the PHP sample:
<?php

define ('HMAC_SHA256', 'sha256');
define ('SECRET_KEY', 'secret_key_redacted');

function sign ($params) {
  return signData(buildDataToSign($params), SECRET_KEY);
}

function signData($data, $secretKey) {
    return base64_encode(hash_hmac('sha256', $data, $secretKey, true));
}

function buildDataToSign($params) {
        $signedFieldNames = explode("","",$params[""signed_field_names""]);
        foreach ($signedFieldNames as &$field) {
           $dataToSign[] = $field . ""="" . $params[$field];
        }
        return commaSeparate($dataToSign);
}

function commaSeparate ($dataToSign) {
    return implode("","",$dataToSign);
}

?>

which is invoked as such:
<?php
foreach($params as $name => $value) {
    echo ""<input type=\""text\"" id=\"""" . $name . ""\"" name=\"""" . $name . ""\"" value=\"""" . $value . ""\""/>\n"";
}

echo ""<input type=\""text\"" id=\""signature\"" name=\""signature\"" value=\"""" . sign($params) . ""\""/>\n"";
?>

This is what I've used in Python to attempt to replicate:
def payment_confirmation(self, *args, **kw):
vars = cherrypy.request.params #takes POST parameters from previous page
del vars['submit'] #removed so it doesnt get signed - part of POST from prev. page

def sign_data(vars):
    for key, value in vars.iteritems():
        yield ""%s=%s,"" % (key, value)

sign_payload = ''.join(sign_data(vars)).rstrip(',')
sign_signature = hashlib.sha256(sign_payload + secret_key).digest().encode('base64')

Here's a sample of the data I'm trying to sign (reduced into the object that's being returned via the sign_data() method in the Python code:
access_key=12345,reference_number=123456789,currency=USD,locale=en,profile_id=1234567,transaction_type=authorization,signed_date_time=2013-07-22T16:30:43Z,amount=25.00,transaction_uuid=0dc4a151-f2ec-11e2-bb29-005056c00008,payment_method=card,signed_field_names=access_key,profile_id,transaction_uuid,payment_token,signed_field_names,signed_date_time,locale,payment_method,transaction_type,amount,reference_number,currency,payment_token=0000000000000000

I realize it's a long-shot, but does anyone see anything that's obviously incorrect about my signature method in Python vs. the provided method in PHP?  I thought it could be a way that the PHP function is encoding the key-value pairs so I tried messing around with that in the Python code but it doesn't seem to have worked.  Thanks in advance!
","In case you're still stuck on that question, you might want to try using:
sign_signature = base64.b64encode(hmac.new(secret_key, sign_payload, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest())

","The app secret is a base-16 string, so you need to convert that to a byte array. Take a look at How can I convert a hex string to a byte array? for details on how to do this. The access_token needs to be converted to a byte array using the ASCII encoding. Once you've generated the HMAC then encode this as a base-16 string to use as your appsecret_proof. The following code will convert a byte array to base16.
public static class Base16
{
    private static readonly char[] encoding;

    static Base16()
    {
        encoding = new char[16]
        {
            '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7',
            '8', '9', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'
        };
    }

    public static string Encode(byte[] data)
    {
        char[] text = new char[data.Length * 2];

        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < data.Length; i++)
        {
            text[j++] = encoding[data[i] >> 4];
            text[j++] = encoding[data[i] & 0xf];
        }

        return new string(text);
    }
}

The code to generate the appsecret_proof would then be
private string GenerateAppSecretProof(string accessToken, string appSecret)
{
    byte[] key = Base16.Decode(appSecret);
    byte[] hash;
    using (HMAC hmacAlg = new HMACSHA1(key))
    {
        hash = hmacAlg.ComputeHash(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(accessToken));
    }
    return Base16.Encode(hash);
}

","The reason behind most of the Java libraries for OAuth 2.0 supports Bearer token types is that Bearer Token profile brings a simplified scheme for authentication. Any user which has a bearer token can use it to get access to the associated resources (without demonstrating possession of a cryptographic key). The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage specifications describes the use of bearer tokens in HTTP requests to access OAuth 2.0 protected resources.

MAC Token Profile defines the HTTP MAC access authentication scheme, providing a method for making authenticated HTTP requests with partial cryptographic verification of the request, covering the HTTP method, request URI, and host. Each access token type definition specifies the additional attributes (mac_key, mac_algorithm) sent to the client together with the access_token response parameter.

     }

The access_token or the MAC key identifier is a string identifying the MAC key used to calculate the request MAC. The string is usually opaque to the client. The server typically assigns a specific scope and lifetime to each set of MAC credentials. The identifier may denote a unique value used to retrieve the authorization information (e.g. from a database), or self-contain the authorization information in a verifiable manner (i.e. a string consisting of some data and a signature).

Thank you for your time!
","The first thing I would like to mention is that the WCF Web Api was a beta project which is no longer being developed. It was replaced by ASP.NET Web API which is an awesome framework for developing RESTful services.
If you want to get a good idea how a RESTful service and authentication works the Netflix API would be a great place to start. They have a lot of documentation regarding the security portion and this helped me understand HMAC a lot more. 
HMAC creates a hash using a secret key. The client and server both maintain a copy of the secret key so that they can generate matching hashes. This allows you to 'sign' a request which serves as both authentication (you know the person sending it is who they say they are), and message integrity (knowing the message they sent is the original message and has not been tampered with).
A signature is created by combining
1. Timestamp (unix epoc is the easiest to send in urls)
2. Nonce (a random number that can never be used twice to protect against someone re-using it)
3. Message (for a GET request this would be the URL, a POST would be the whole body)
4. Signature (the three previous items combined and hashed using the secret key)

Each of the above can be sent in the query string of the request, then the server can use the first 3 and their copy of the secret key to recreate the signature. If the signatures match then all is good.
In a RESTful API that is over plain HTTP (not using HTTPS over an ssl), I would sign every request sent because again this authenticates and provides message integrity. Otherwise if you just send an authentication token you know the user is authenticated but how do you know the message was not tampered with if you do not have a Message Digest (the HMAC hash) to compare with? 
An easy way to implement the server-side checking of the signature is to override OnAuthorization for System.Web.Http.AuthorizeAttribute (Make sure not to use Mvc autorize attribute). Have it rebuild the signature just as you did on the client side using their secret key, and if it does not match you can return a 401. Then you can decorate all controllers that require authentication with your new authorize attribute.
Hopefully this helps clear up some of your confusion and does not muddy the water even further. I can provide some more concrete examples later if you need.

","Looking at your questions in turn
...do I pass an unencrypted username (message) for this and should return just a true / false or should it return an encrypted string in which I will be using later on for other transactions (Delete, Insert services, etc)?
If you just returned a boolean, you'd have no way to then match the authentication request to subsequent requests. You'll need to return some sort of authentication indicator, on a classic website this would be the session cookie, in your instance you want to pass a value that will act as shared key.
Is it better that I save something in the database 'with a timestamp'? Or do I just return it with the encrypted message so that everytime a request is made the timestamp is already attached?
Back to the session analogy, you want to store the key from question one somewhere (the database?) with a timestamp that indicates the life of the session/validity of the key. If it's forever then I wouldn't bother with the timestamp, if it's anything else you'll need something to say when it expires.
The way I understood it is that the key will be the password of the user. So if the user sends his username I can open the message using the password of that user? This makes sense if the user already has a session and is just requesting to get data or requesting for a delete, insert, etc. Should it still be the same way if it's just authenticating the username and password of the user?
This is where the HMACing happens. You have your shared secret, you have a message, this is how I usually combine it all together.
Use all of the message as the body of data to be hashed (that way you can be sure that someone's not just copied the hash and part of the message). Hash the body of the message using the key we shared in step one. You could salt this if wanted, I'd use the username.
Finally make sure the message contains a timestamp (UTC preferably), this way you can help prevent replaying the message later. The service that's responding to the message can compare the timestamp to what it thinks the time is. If it falls outside given bounds, fail the message. Because the timestamp will be part of the HMAC, someone can't just update the date and replay the message, the hashes won't match as soon as the message is tampered with.

SOLVED: Thanks for everyone below. But I'm not gotta tell you that the real reason is I typed ""TE S T"" in my python IDE while typed ""TE X T"" in this post :P
For not wasting your time, I made some tests and got a nicer solution, base on your answers:
print get_signature('KEY', 'TEXT')                        
# 7FH0NG0Ou4nb5luKUyjfrdWunos=

print get_signature(bytearray('KEY'), bytearray('TEXT'))  
# 7FH0NG0Ou4nb5luKUyjfrdWunos=

print get_signature('KEY', u'你好'.encode('utf-8'))  # best solution, i think!
# PxEm7Oibj7ijZ55ko7V3isSkD1Q=

print get_signature('KEY', bytearray(u'你好'))           
# TypeError: unicode argument without an encoding

print get_signature('KEY', u'你好')                      
# UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 0-1: ordinal not in range(128)

print get_signature(u'KEY', 'TEXT')                      
# TypeError: character mapping must return integer, None or unicode

print get_signature(b'KEY', b'TEXT')                       
# 7FH0NG0Ou4nb5luKUyjfrdWunos=

Conclusion: 

The message to be signature should be encoded to utf-8 string with both sides.
(Thanks to DJV)In python 3, strings are all unicode, so they should be used with 'b', or bytearray(thanks to Burhan Khalid), or encoded to utf-8 string.

","Your friend is completely right, but so are you (sorta). Your function is completely right in both Python 2 and Python 3. However, your call is a little erroneous in Python 3. You see, in Python 3, strings are unicode, so in order to pass an ASCII string (as your Objective C friend does and as you would do in Python 2), you need to call your function with:
get_signature(b'KEY', b'TEXT')

in order to specify that those strings are bytes a.k.a. ASCII strings.
EDIT: As Burhan Khalid noted, the flexible way of doing this in Python 3 is to either call your function like this:
get_signature(key.encode('ascii'), test.encode('ascii'))

or define it as:
def get_signature(key, msg):
    if(isinstance(key, str)):
        key = key.encode('ascii')
    if(isinstance(msg, str)):
        msg = msg.encode('ascii')
    return base64.b64encode(hmac.new(key, msg, hashlib.sha1).digest())

","These are the common causes for “HMAC validation Failure”:

API key and/or API secret are incorrect.
Leading or trailing spaces in the API key, API secret, merchant token.

Timestamp in the HTTP header is not within 5 minutes of our server time.
System time is not accurate.

The server must decrypt the padded data and simply throw away the last 50 characters.

At step 3, the PIN is stored in the database. The server has no way of knowing that the request to save the PIN comes from a legitimate user.

At account creation
When the old PIN is provided

That being said, a PIN stays very weak and easy to break. A 4 digit pin will be guessed in about 5000 tries, on average.

Does anyone have a method that passes these tests in Delphi using this library?

The OpenSSL test is in hmactest.c, but it only checks EVP_md5 and the test vectors aren't all the same as in the RFC.

I don't know how this code by shunty will look pasted in because it looks terrible here (I'm a stackoverflow novice). I used RAND_seed rather than RAND_load_file like he did, but otherwise it's the same:
function TForm1.GetHMAC(const AKey, AData: string): TBytes;
var
  key, data: TBytes;
  md_len: integer;
  res: PByte;
  buf: PInteger;
  rand_val: Integer;
begin
  OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms;

  Randomize;
  rand_val := Random(100);
  GetMem(buf, rand_val);
  try
    RAND_seed(buf, rand_val);

    key := TEncoding.UTF8.GetBytes(AKey);
    data := TEncoding.UTF8.GetBytes(AData);
    md_len := EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE;
    SetLength(Result, md_len);
    res := HMAC(EVP_sha256, @key[0], Length(key), @data[0], Length(data), @result[0], md_len);
    if (res <> nil) then
      SetLength(Result, md_len);

  finally
    FreeMem(buf);
  end;
end;

The code I use to test looks like this. This particular method is for test 3 which fails. The result is bb861233f283aef2ef7aea09785245c9f3c62720c9d04e0c232789f27a586e44, but it should be equal to the constant hex value for TEST3_DIGEST:
procedure TForm1.btnTestCase3Click(Sender: TObject);
var
  LBytesDigest: TBytes;
  LHashString: string;
  LHexDigest: string;
begin
  LBytesDigest := GetHMAC(HexToStr(TEST3_KEY), HexToStr(TEST3_DATA));

  LHexDigest := LowerCase(BytesToHex(LBytesDigest));

  if LHexDigest = TEST3_DIGEST then begin
    Memo1.Lines.Add('SUCCESS: Matches test case');
    Memo1.Lines.Add(LHexDigest);
  end else begin
    Memo1.Lines.Add('ERROR: Does not match test case');
    Memo1.Lines.Add('Result:    ' + LHexDigest);
    Memo1.Lines.Add('Test Case: ' + TEST3_DIGEST);
  end;
end;

Any ideas? I'm about to give up and just create a .NET app using the library they provide...

When you decode them into (Unicode)String values, many of the resulting characters are outside of the ASCII range of characters, which means they have to be interpretted by Ansi codepages before you can convert them to UTF-8 correctly (which you should not be using in this situation anyway).
You need to change your implementation to decode your hex strings straight to TBytes instead (you can use Classes.HexToBin() for that) so the correct byte values are preserved and passed to HMAC, and get rid of TEncoding.UTF8.GetBytes() completely:

"45985661","Is HKDF implemented in Java Cryptography Architecture?","In the application I'm writing I need to do HKDF to derive two different keys from one password. Searching for examples on how to it in Java I found these two:

https://github.com/WhisperSystems/libsignal-protocol-java/blob/master/java/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/libsignal/kdf/HKDF.java
https://www.javatips.net/api/keywhiz-master/hkdf/src/main/java/keywhiz/hkdf/Hkdf.java

In both cases HKDF is implemented on top of the HMAC provided by JCA. I haven't read those implementations in detail yet but I was wondering, is this not implemented anywhere in JCA or itself? Do I have to implement my own HKDF?
The part that worries me the most, is making a mistake in applying the info argument. It looks non-trivial and critical.
","HKDF Implementations in Java
No, Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)-based key derivation function (HKDF) has, like most KDFs, no standard implementation in JCA.
There are some implementations embedded in other projects (like you already said):

mozilla-services/sync-crypto
WhisperSystems/libsignal-protocol-java
square/keywhiz

Also there is, of course, Bouncy Castle which use their own Hmac/Mac implementations and APIs. BC is however a massive dependency, and may be unpractical for e.g. embedded or mobile use case. For this I implemented a standalone, lightweight java lib (passing all of the RFC 5869 test vectors), which works with any javax.crypto.Mac instance:

https://github.com/patrickfav/hkdf

If you prefer, you could, of course implement it on your own, it's a fairly straight forward spec, when using the built-in JCA Hmac implementation.
Info Parameter in HKDF
From the RFC 5869:

While the 'info' value is optional in the definition of HKDF, it is
  often of great importance in applications.  Its main objective is to
  bind the derived key material to application- and context-specific
  information. (...)  In particular, it may prevent the derivation
  of the same keying material for different contexts.

So for example if you want to derive an Secret Key and IV from the same source material you would use the info parameter (using this lib):
//example input
String userInput = ""this is a user input with bad entropy"";

HKDF hkdf = HKDF.fromHmacSha256();

//extract the ""raw"" data to create output with concentrated entropy
byte[] pseudoRandomKey = hkdf.extract(staticSalt32Byte, userInput.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));

//create expanded bytes for e.g. AES secret key and IV
byte[] expandedAesKey = hkdf.expand(pseudoRandomKey, ""aes-key"".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8), 16);
byte[] expandedIv = hkdf.expand(pseudoRandomKey, ""aes-iv"".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8), 16);

//Example boilerplate encrypting a simple string with created key/iv
SecretKey key = new SecretKeySpec(expandedAesKey, ""AES""); //AES-128 key
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, new IvParameterSpec(expandedIv));
byte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(""my secret message"".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));

Why am I experiencing the problem with OpenSSL 1.1, and how to fix it in a way that maintains backward compatibility with OpenSSL 1.0? 
","For fixing the error, please read: Upgrade To OpenSSL 1.1.0. Basically, you need to create a new HMAC_CTX as follows:
HMAC_CTX *h = HMAC_CTX_new();
HMAC_Init_ex(h, key, keylen, EVP_sha256(), NULL);
...
HMAC_CTX_free(h);

Update - Bounty Added
Still having trouble with this, I have managed to test the C# code in Visual Studio, but am having trouble getting the same hash generated in PHP.
I would like...
.. the above C# code (specifically, the 3 lines which create the SHA1 hash) to be converted into PHP (Check out the Pseudo Code I posted above). I should be able to match the C# hash using PHP.
If you have any other questions, please ask.
","It's pretty easy, when i don't have to test the code :P
http://php.net/manual/en/function.hash-hmac.php - that's the equivalent of the HMACSHA1 c# class.
string hash_hmac (string $algo , string $data , string $key [, bool $raw_output = false ] )
So $algo = ""sha1""
$data is your $stringToSign - since that is already an ascii string (i hope) - the C# was just taking the byte equivalent of the same.
new Guid(apiToken).toByteArray() -> that's a 16 byte (16*8 = 128) representation of the GUID - which is 32*4 = 128 bits. This is the key. 
$key is a string so you need the ASCII string equivalent for your $apiToken (which is 32 hex chars - first strip / ignore the dashes in between) - E10247631234567891E0T32E4E7EB316 (correct the key - it cannot have a ""T"")
function hex2str($hex) {
    for($i=0;$i<strlen($hex);$i+=2) $str .= chr(hexdec(substr($hex,$i,2)));
    return $str;
}

$hexKey = hex2str($apiToken); //strip the dashes first

http://www.linux-support.com/cms/php-convert-hex-strings-to-ascii-strings/
So the method call now works : 
$almostResult = hash_hmac (""sha1"" , $stringToSign, $hexKey, true)

This returns a binary string - which you need to convert to base64 encoding.
$final = base64_encode ($almostResult)

That should do it...enjoy :)

","I got this working locally. Looks like you're double encoding your signature. 
the steps for creating a signature are:

create the initial string that forms the basis of the signature
decode your secret to get a KeySpec (new SecretKeySpec())
init your HMAC with the keyspec (sha256Hmac.init())
use the secret to encode the request signature (sha256Hmac.doFinal())
base64 encode the result of step 4.

The only error you've made in the above snippet is to then base64 encode it again in your headers.

"23596622","TLS 1.0-calculating the finished message MAC","I'm having trouble calculating the MAC of the finished message.The RFC gives the formula

HMAC_hash(MAC_write_secret, seq_num + TLSCompressed.type +
                       TLSCompressed.version + TLSCompressed.length +
                       TLSCompressed.fragment));  

But the tlsCompressed(tlsplaintext in this case because no compression is used) does not contain version information:(hex dump)

14 00 00 0c 2c 93 e6 c5 d1 cb 44 12 bd a0 f9 2d  

the first byte is the tlsplaintext.type, followed by uint24 length.
The full message, with the MAC and padding appended and before encryption is  

1400000c2c93e6c5d1cb4412bda0f92dbc175a02daab04c6096da8d4736e7c3d251381b10b  

I have tried to calculate the hmac with the following parameters(complying to the rfc) but it does not work:  
uint64 seq_num  
uint8  tlsplaintext.type  
uint8  tlsplaintext.version_major  
uint8  tlscompressed.version_minor  
uint16 tlsplaintext.length  
opaque tlsplaintext.fragment

I have also tried omitting the version and using uint24 length instead.no luck.
My hmac_hash() function cannot be the problem because it has worked thus far. I am also able to compute the verify_data and verify it.
Because this is the first message sent under the new connection state, the sequence number is 0.
So, what exactly are the parameters for the calculation of the MAC for the finished message?
","Here's the relevant source from Forge (JS implementation of TLS 1.0):
The HMAC function:
var hmac_sha1 = function(key, seqNum, record) {
    /* MAC is computed like so:
    HMAC_hash(
      key, seqNum +
        TLSCompressed.type +
        TLSCompressed.version +
        TLSCompressed.length +
        TLSCompressed.fragment)
    */
    var hmac = forge.hmac.create();
    hmac.start('SHA1', key);
    var b = forge.util.createBuffer();
    b.putInt32(seqNum[0]);
    b.putInt32(seqNum[1]);
    b.putByte(record.type);
    b.putByte(record.version.major);
    b.putByte(record.version.minor);
    b.putInt16(record.length);
    b.putBytes(record.fragment.bytes());
    hmac.update(b.getBytes());
    return hmac.digest().getBytes();
};

The function that creates the Finished record:
tls.createFinished = function(c) {
    // generate verify_data
    var b = forge.util.createBuffer();
    b.putBuffer(c.session.md5.digest());
    b.putBuffer(c.session.sha1.digest());

    // TODO: determine prf function and verify length for TLS 1.2
    var client = (c.entity === tls.ConnectionEnd.client);
    var sp = c.session.sp;
    var vdl = 12;
    var prf = prf_TLS1;
    var label = client ? 'client finished' : 'server finished';
    b = prf(sp.master_secret, label, b.getBytes(), vdl);

    // build record fragment
    var rval = forge.util.createBuffer();
    rval.putByte(tls.HandshakeType.finished);
    rval.putInt24(b.length());
    rval.putBuffer(b);
    return rval;
};

The code to handle a Finished message is a bit lengthier and can be found here. I see that I have a comment in that code that sounds like it might be relevant to your problem:
 // rewind to get full bytes for message so it can be manually
 // digested below (special case for Finished messages because they
 // must be digested *after* handling as opposed to all others)

Does this help you spot anything in your implementation?
Update 1
Per your comments, I wanted to clarify how TLSPlainText works. TLSPlainText is the main ""record"" for the TLS protocol. It is the ""wrapper"" or ""envelope"" for content-specific types of messages. It always looks like this:
struct {
    ContentType type;
    ProtocolVersion version;
    uint16 length;
    opaque fragment[TLSPlaintext.length];
} TLSPlaintext;

So it always has a version. A Finished message is a type of handshake message. All handshake messages have a content type of 22. A handshake message looks like this:
struct {
    HandshakeType msg_type;
    uint24 length;
    body
} Handshake;

A Handshake message is yet another envelope/wrapper for other messages, like the Finished message. In this case, the body will be a Finished message (HandshakeType 20), which looks like this:
struct {
    opaque verify_data[12];
} Finished;

To actually send a Finished message, you have to wrap it up in a Handshake message envelope, and then like any other message, you have to wrap it up in a TLS record (TLSPlainText). The ultimate result looks/represents something like this:
struct {
    ContentType type=22;
    ProtocolVersion version=<major, minor>;
    uint16 length=<length of fragment>;
    opaque fragment=<struct {
        HandshakeType msg_type=20;
        uint24 length=<length of finished message>;
        body=<struct {
          opaque verify_data[12]>;
        } Finished>
    } Handshake>
} TLSPlainText;

Then, before transport, the record may be altered. You can think of these alterations as operations that take a record and transform its fragment (and fragment length). The first operation compresses the fragment. After compression you compute the MAC, as described above and then append that to the fragment. Then you encrypt the fragment (adding the appropriate padding if using a block cipher) and replace it with the ciphered result. So, when you're finished, you've still got a record with a type, version, length, and fragment, but the fragment is encrypted.
So, just so we're clear, when you're computing the MAC for the Finished message, imagine passing in the above TLSPlainText (assuming there's no compression as you indicated) to a function. This function takes this TLSPlainText record, which has properties for type, version, length, and fragment. The HMAC function above is run on the record. The HMAC key and sequence number  (which is 0 here) are provided via the session state. Therefore, you can see that everything the HMAC function needs is available.
In any case, hopefully this better explains how the protocol works and that will maybe reveal what's going wrong with your implementation.

Many people recommend Amazon S3 Restful API as the role model, hence if I understand that, I could create something similar for my own purposes.
Amazon's S3 REST API.
e.g. this example here explains the process very nicely, however it fails to explain, which side is generating the API-key? So upon user signup, is it the service side that is generating the private API-key and assigns it to the user id in database?
If this is the case though, the client needs to know the API key in order to create the signature for each request, so that the service can actually verify it. So how do both sides get hold of the private API key?
In my case I would have a iPhone app and a AngularJS web app as my clients talking to the RESTful API service.
Many Thanks,
","First, you don't want give out keys to your clients. In general, that's a security nightmare. (Also, key creation can take some hours to propagate. And you'll have to manage the permissions for each key, etc.)  So all the signing is done by your server, and your key doesn't leave your server.
You want your server to have the S3 key, but only return signed links that will give the client the power to do something (GET a particular file, or PUT a file).  It's a bit like the mother-may-I game: The client asks you for a ""S3 signed link"", then it can talk to S3 to do one thing.  Since your server is doing a trivial amount of work (checking request is authorized, then returning a signed URL), you will be able to scale pretty well.
For some things, like ""list files"" or ""delete a file"", it might be better for your server to call S3 (i.e. making a web request to S3 within the web request from the client) and return the results to the client (instead of messing with signed links). But if you do this, you may run into problems when scaling -- unless you are using the right technologies. (I.e. you want an evented server like node.js)
Note that for a PUT request, the signed link must specify a lot of stuff ahead of time (like the file type, etc). You have to read the AWS spec carefully.
Be careful of the Confused Deputy problem. Your code will have one key that can see all user's files, so you are responsible for the security between users.

"20240681","RESTful API with HMAC: how to manage user authentication","I am developing a RESTful API for my web and mobile applications. My intention with this API is to store all data of users so that my applications can access them easily. It is like Google's solution: you don't have a separate account for Gmail and Youtube, but a shared one.
For every request (that needs USER authentication, not only APPLICATION authentication) the following workflow is applied:

Application determines the message of the request:
MESSAGE= URL + HEADERS + BODY
Application calculates the signature of the request:
SIGNATURE= HMAC(HMAC(MESSAGE, user_password), application_key)
Application sends the request via HTTP/HTTPS:
REQUEST= MESSAGE + Signature
API recreates the signature to authenticate both user and application:
SIGNATURE= application_id/user_id HMAC(HMAC(MESSAGE, user_password_from_database), application_key)

Where e.g.:

application_id = 1
user_id = 123456
user_password= 'mypass'
user_password_from_database= '$2y$10$1234567890abcde...'

The problem with this approach is that passwords in the database are irreversibly hashed (with BCrypt), and that's why I can't use them when I want to the recreate the signature of the request.
My question is how it can be accomplished yet? Is sending user_password_from_database to the application via HTTPS a good practice? My basic workflow would be:

User logs in to the application with user_email and user_password
Application sends these credentials via HTTPS to the API
API responds with user_id and user_password_from_database if credentials are OK
From now, application can use these data to determine SIGNATURE.
From now, API can recreate SIGNATURE because user_password_from_database is the secret key, not user_password

How secure is this algorithm? Does HTTPS prevent abuse of user_password_from_database?
Footnote: the signing method detailed above is just an example, indeed I took Amazon's AWS Signature Version 4 algorithm and tried to add some user authentication to it.

The word problem version of what I'm trying to do is: (from api documentation)
Calculating Request Signatures
A request signature, an HMAC with an SHA-1 hash code, is calculated by concatenating the values of the Service, Method, and Timestamp parameters, in that order, and then calculating an RFC 2104-compliant HMAC, using the Secret Access Key as the ""key"". The computed HMAC value must be base64 encoded
The test data:
service_name = “Zoyto Fulfillment Service”
timestamp: “2010-07-21T04:33:55Z”
api_secret = “2c0774063f4bb1a10ca39ba6c806636a57d78dc3”
method = “getOrderStatus”

Result should be:
signature: “mlePFDcrTAxd+PWA6hOGGtvu2Zc=”

I have the following code example of a c# method for creating a signature hash to make an API call:
public string createSignature(string api_secret, string method, string timestamp, string service_name) { 
  DateTime currentTime = DateTime.UtcNow; string toSign = service_name.ToLower() +   method.ToLower() + timestamp.ToLower(); 
  byte[] toSignBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(toSign); byte[] secretBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(api_secret); 
  HMAC signer = new HMACSHA1(secretBytes byte[] sigBytes = signer.ComputeHash(toSignBytes); 
  string signature = Convert.ToBase64String(sigBytes); 
  return signature; 
}

Currently, my php method looks like:
$testSecret = '2c0774063f4bb1a10ca39ba6c806636a57d78dc3';
$testSvc    = 'Zoyto Fulfillment Service';
$testStamp  = strtotime('2010-07-21 04:33:55');   
$method = 'getOrderStatus';

$sig    = utf8_encode($testSvc.$method.$testStamp);

$hash   = hash_hmac(""sha1"", $sig, $testSecret, true);

$sig    = base64_encode($hash);
return $sig;

//returns:
//OUhgiIqxngaFm1Rquxm1lZ/3CzE=

Any help is appreciated

function createSignature($api_secret, $method, $timestamp, $service_name) {

"17929107","CryptoJS (HMAC Sha256) giving incorrect output?","Let me start by saying I'm no expert in cryptography algorithms...
I am trying to build a method which formats an HTTP header for Windows Azure - and this header requires part of its message to be encrypted via HMAC with SHA256 (and then also base64 encoded).
I chose to use CryptoJS because it's got an active user community.
First, my code:
_encodeAuthHeader : function (url, params, date) {
    //http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/dd179428
    var canonicalizedResource = '/' + this.getAccountName() + url;

    /*
     StringToSign = Date + ""\n"" + CanonicalizedResource
     */
    var stringToSign = date + '\n' + canonicalizedResource;
    console.log('stringToSign >> ' + stringToSign)

    var encodedBits = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(stringToSign, this.getAccessKey());
    console.log('encodedBits >> ' + encodedBits);

    var base64Bits = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(encodedBits);
    console.log('base64Bits >> ' + base64Bits);

    var signature = 'SharedKeyLite ' + this.getAccountName() + ':' + base64Bits;
    console.log('signature >> ' + signature);

    return signature;
},

The method successfully returns a ""signature"" with the appropriate piece encrypted/encoded. However, Azure complains that it's not formatted correctly.
Some example output:
stringToSign >> Mon, 29 Jul 2013 16:04:20 GMT\n/senchaazurestorage/Tables

encodedBits >> 6723ace2ec7b0348e1270ccbaab802bfa5c1bbdddd108aece88c739051a8a767

base64Bits >> ZyOs4ux7A0jhJwzLqrgCv6XBu93dEIrs6IxzkFGop2c=

signature >> SharedKeyLite senchaazurestorage:ZyOs4ux7A0jhJwzLqrgCv6XBu93dEIrs6IxzkFGop2c=

Doing some debugging, I am noticing that CryptoJS is not returning the same value (HMAC with SHA256) as alternative implementations. For example, the string ""Mon, 29 Jul 2013 16:04:20 GMT\n/senchaazurestorage/Tables"" appears as:

""6723ace2ec7b0348e1270ccbaab802bfa5c1bbdddd108aece88c739051a8a767"" via CryptoJS
""faa89f45ef029c63d04b8522d07c54024ae711924822c402b2d387d05398fc9f"" via PHP hash_hmac('sha256', ... )

Digging even deeper, I'm seeing that most HMAC/SHA265 algorithms return data which matches the output from PHP... am I missing something in CryptoJS? Or is there a legitimate difference?
","As I mentioned in my first comment, the newline (""\n"") was causing problems. Escaping that (""\ \n"", without the space inbetween) seems to have fixed the inconsistency in HMAC/SHA256 output.
I'm still having problems with the Azure HTTP ""Authorization"" header, but that's another issue.

"3018173","Double hashing passwords - client & server","Hey, first, let me say, I'm not asking about things like md5(md5(..., there are already topics about it.
My question is this:
We allow our clients to store their passwords locally. Naturally, we don't want them stored in plan text, so we hmac them locally, before storing and/or sending. Now, this is fine, but if this is all we did, then the server would have the stored hmac, and since the client only needs to send the hmac, not the plain text password, an attacker could use the stored hashes from the server to access anyone's account (in the catastrophic scenario where someone would get such an access to the database, of course).
So, our idea was to encode the password on the client once via hmac, send it to the server, and there encode it a second time via hmac and match it against the stored, two times hmac'ed password. This would ensure that:

The client can store the password locally without having to store it as plain text
The client can send the password without having to worry (too much) about other network parties
The server can store the password without having to worry about someone stealing it from the server and using it to log in.

Naturally, all the other things (strong passwords, double salt, etc) apply as well, but aren't really relevant to the question.
The actual question is: does this sound like a solid security design ? Did we overlook any flaws with doing things this way ? Is there maybe a security pattern for something like this ?
Addendum: the reason we don't want to locally store the password in plain text on the client is because as sad as it is, many people still use the same password for multiple services, so getting the 'real' password would be a bigger security breach for the user than getting his hash stolen.
","Caveat: I'm not a security expert. I'll ping blowdart to see if he fancies joining in.
If the client is just storing the hash, and effectively transmitting something just based on the hash, then they're effectively storing it in plain text. The only benefit that the first hash is providing is that if they've used the same password on a different system, that other system won't be compromised if the hash is revealed.
To put it another way: if someone can get hold of the hash that's stored on the server, that's all they need to log into the system... just like plain text storage.

","I'm not exactly sure what this buys you over storing the password locally in plaintext.  
The purpose of local encryption is to prevent a hacker from being able to send the password to your server.  However, if you are going to send the encrypted form over... well, you haven't bought anything.
Instead, the local machine should store the password in a two-way encrypted format.  Meaning that it can be decrypted.  Which you do prior to transmittal.  The db can store a one-way encrypted format (even using a separate encryption mechanism).  Prior to comparison, you encrypt what you received then check.

","No, this isn't safe. The hashed value is effectively the password. The fact the password was derived from something else that the user thinks of as the password doesn't matter. It's a secret value that authenticates a user, right? Sounds like a password to me.
I think it hinges on the statement, ""Naturally, we don't want them stored in plan text, so we hmac them locally, before storing and/or sending."" If the system is altered so that the hash password now has the same power the password once had, the same level of caution should be used with the hashed password.

Addendum: the reason we don't want to locally store the password in plain text on the client is because as sad as it is, many people still use the same password for multiple services, so getting the 'real' password would be a bigger security breach for the user than getting his hash stolen.
","As others have said, taking the client and your system in isolation this doesn't really buy you anything - the first hash simply becomes the password.
The value comes if (as is likely) the client uses that same password on other systems.  In this case, should the client machine be compromised then at least your local copy of their hashed password doesn't allow the attacker access to other systems. Obviously the attacker of the client will now be able to access your server - they have, after all, got the password.
An attacker having access to the double-hashed value on the server won't buy them anything, since they can't reverse that to get the single hash (i.e., the ""password"").  Of course, if the attacker is in a position to read your security database then I suspect they have other attack vectors available :)
Also, as another poster said, make sure you are using a salt on both hashes.  Without doing so, reversing the hashes may actually be quite simple if the passwords are not strong.
EDIT - actually, thinking about it, since you are using a hash as the password you don't really need to use a salt on the server.  No way anyone is going to be able to create a rainbow table that's effective :)  Still need one on the client though.

My question is this:
We allow our clients to store their passwords locally. Naturally, we don't want them stored in plan text, so we hmac them locally, before storing and/or sending. Now, this is fine, but if this is all we did, then the server would have the stored hmac, and since the client only needs to send the hmac, not the plain text password, an attacker could use the stored hashes from the server to access anyone's account (in the catastrophic scenario where someone would get such an access to the database, of course).
So, our idea was to encode the password on the client once via hmac, send it to the server, and there encode it a second time via hmac and match it against the stored, two times hmac'ed password. This would ensure that:

The client can store the password locally without having to store it as plain text
The client can send the password without having to worry (too much) about other network parties
The server can store the password without having to worry about someone stealing it from the server and using it to log in.

","I am running out the door, but the Skeet pinged and you don't mess with the Skeet.
What you're doing is replacing a password with another constant value. You gain nothing here, the only security you have is that the plain text password cannot be discovered on the client machine.
What you then appear to do is treating the HMAC (are you sure you mean HMAC? If so, where is the key coming from, and stored?) of the password as the password itself - you send it from the client to the server where it is used to authenticate. The second HMAC or hashing is meaningless - you're comparing against the value sent - it's a password by any other name. So, as an attacker, instead of stealing the password, I just need to steal the HMAC stored on the client machine. Nothing is gained at all here.

","blowdart hit the nail on the head - you're just changing the secet to steal, not securing anything.  What you're trying to replicate is an old authentication protocol that I can't for the life of me remember the name of.  Here's how it works:
Upon initialization, the server gets your password, iteratively hashed n times, represented by Fn(pass).  The client has the password, and the number n.
You go to authenticate, and send the server Fn-1(pass) - that is, the password hashed n-1 times.  The server hashes it one more time, compares it to Fn(pass) and if they match you get access.  The server then replaces Fn(pass) with Fn-1(pass) and you decrement n.
The next time you go to authenticate you send Fn-2(pass) and the process repeats.
Let's examine the security:

MITM: no resistence built into the protocol, you'd have to layer it inside SSL
Replay attacks: they don't work, because the server has decremented the hash iterations.  
Eavesdropping:  The next authentication will be done using Fn-1(pass).  You have Fn(pass).  Going from Fn(pass) to Fn-1(pass) is, by definition of the hash function, infeasible
Owning the server: You don't know the client's password, nor can you authenticate as them, because again you would need Fn-1(pass) when you only have Fn
Owning the client: Since you store Fn-1(pass) (so they don't have to enter pass) - then owning the client would let the attacker login.  If you only store n and not the password this would be prevented, but you clearly want to save the password.

That's what you're trying to accomplish.  However, there's a reason this protocol isn't in use - it's a giant bitch to syncronize.  If the client and server get out of sync due to a half-completed step, you're locked out.  Any resilience you built in to avoid that would likely reduce the security to replay or eavesdropping.

Obviously, there are problems with this.
What I can see is 

How to store the user data server side. I can't store the plaintext password, I can't store the password hashed and storing the user's key is asking for trouble. I can't seem to get around this issue.
Is it possible to store the key client side while the app is running in memory such that it can't be gotten at? Obviously, using a tool like firebug or the webdev tools that come with chrome and firefox, you can get at it. but is it possible to nest it in code so deeply or even in an anonymous function such that, you are unable to get at it easily. I am not very worried about this though since it will be my own app that is running.
What is an appropriate timeout to apply to the request?
Are there any glaring holes that I can't see? Maybe due to inattention blindness.

Thanks.
EDIT
As I said, this is just a proof, I forgot to add that the request method/verb will be added to the hash as well.
This answer seems to hold the answer to password storage, but it is not clear how to use api keys/share secret.
EDIT 2
Another issue I see here is allowing users to enter their passwords on other consumers applications. A good solution will be to use some sort of API keys or Shared secret, but then any ideas on this?

"22469118","Web App Authentication for REST API Backend","I am currently in the early stages of creating a web application (HTML5, JS, etc.) that uses a REST API on the backend (Java, specifically Jersey v1.18). The nature of the data that will be stored is highly sensitive, so security is something that I’ve started looking at, even though the application is only in the early stages. The eventual goal will be to have native mobile applications as well, and to potentially provide access to the data for external clients via the same API.
In my research thus far, I have identified a variety of authentication methods, including HTTP Basic, token-based, session cookie, OAuth, HMAC, etc. The key component here is that the REST API will be primarily accessed by users, rather than other applications or backends. Thus, having a “login/logout” equivalent is important, and this boils down to user level authentication.
So far, HMAC authentication looks to be the most promising, as we have no plans to integrate with any OAuth provider at this moment.
I have already read through dozens of SO posts, as well as articles such as:
http://www.thebuzzmedia.com/designing-a-secure-rest-api-without-oauth-authentication/
http://www.errant.me.uk/blog/2013/04/authenticating-restful-web-applications/ (note: this is clearly bad, as salting with the username is not recommended)
Ideally, HMAC seems like the way to go, but I have yet to see a recommended approach to handling the shared secret. The idea of using a resource to validate credentials, which then provides a token/nonce to be used with the HMAC scheme, seems to be an option, but I’m questioning the advantages over just using this token/nonce strictly as a token.
I know that HMAC authentication for a REST API has been discussed at length, but when used in conjunction with the authentication details that users have come to expect (username, email, password, etc.), is there any recommended approach that doesn’t require a pre-shared secret key?
","This is primarily an opinion-based question, but I'll offer my two cents: just go for a session cookie.
If your primary audience is humans, and you don't need to integrate with third parties, don't bother with OAuth. Just make sure your API is only available over HTTPS, and issue a session token that the server can revoke after login. Strictly speaking it doesn't need to be a cookie; I've seen APIs that stash the token in HTML5 session storage and provide it in the Authorization header or as a query param.
If you have SSL set up properly, your users will get the expected padlock in the browser, and you'll be safe from anyone in between you and the client. If the client is compromised, you're screwed anyways. And since the client can't keep a secret, there aren't a lot of advantages to more complex HMAC schemes.

I'm sure I'm missing something small, but I cannot see it. 
Any help would be very much appreciated!

","It turns out the code above is perfect, but I was passing the wrong HTTP method value into it! 
Where I was getting the error, I was POST'ing JSON, but I had actually put ""GET"" into the GetAuthorizationMethod!
Once I'd corrected that, I got an access_token value from Tent.is.

","From the README inside http://www.openfusion.com.au/labs/dist/mod_auth_tkt/mod_auth_tkt-2.1.0.tar.gz
Cookie Format

The TKTAuthCookieName cookie is constructed using following algorithm:`

('+' is concatenation operation)

cookie := digest + hextimestamp + user_id + '!' + user_data

or if using tokens:

cookie := digest + hextimestamp + user_id + '!' + token_list + '!' + user_data

digest := MD5(digest0 + key)

digest0 := MD5(iptstamp + key + user_id + '\0' + token_list + '\0' + user_data)

iptstamp is a 8 bytes long byte array, bytes 0-3 are filled with
client's IP address as a binary number in network byte order, bytes
4-7 are filled with timestamp as a binary number in network byte
order. 

hextimestamp is 8 character long hexadecimal number expressing
timestamp used in iptstamp. 

token_list is an optional comma-separated list of access tokens 
for this user. This list is checked if TKTAuthToken is set for a
particular area.

user_data is optional

"48843112","How to compare HMAC SHA256 signatures from request body in NodeJS","I am trying to use Dropbox's API, and I got it to successfully send me alerts via webhooks, but now I want to verify the signatures every time they send me an alert.
From dropbox's documentation, they write:
""Every notification request will include a header called X-Dropbox-Signature that includes an HMAC-SHA256 signature of the request body, using your app secret as the signing key. This lets your app verify that the notification really came from Dropbox.""
So I successfully catch that signature, and I use NodeJS built in crypto module to try to create my own signature with HMAC SHA256 and then compare my signature against the signature Dropbox sends me.
Here is my code for doing so:
  var sign = req.get(""X-Dropbox-Signature"");
  console.log(sign);
  var hmac = crypto.createHmac(algorithm, secret);
  hmac.update(JSON.stringify(req.body));
  hash = hmac.digest('hex');
  console.log(hash);

Where algorithm is just 'sha256'
and secret is my secret key that I got from my dropbox apps page.
I have to use JSON.stringify(req.body) because req.body is an object and hmac.update takes a string. I am wondering if that is where my error comes from?
I console log the sign which is the signature from dropbox, and then I console log the signature which I created using hmac, but it is a different signature.
Any suggestions to what I may be doing wrong?
","Greg is right. You need to use the raw body request to check the ingredients of the message. The following code employs the body-parser library to extract the raw body.
var bodyParser = require(""body-parser"");

app.use(bodyParser.json({verify:function(req,res,buf){req.rawBody=buf}}))

Then for the post method:
app.post('/webhooks', function(req, res) {

    const retrievedSignature = req.get(""X-header-Integrity"")
    //send this body string for validation with secret
    const bodyString = new Buffer(req.rawBody, 'utf8')

    let check = integrityCheck(retrievedSignature, bodyString, ""secret"")

"48171199","Generating one-time-only security tokens from UUID or HMAC/JWT/hash?","I'm build the backend for a web app. When a new user goes to the site and clicks the Sign Up button, they'll fill out a super simple form asking them for their username + password and they'll submit. This prompts the server to send a verification email to that email address. They'll then check their email, click a link (which verifies their email) and then be routed to the login page so they can sign in if they choose.
In order to verify their email, when the server generates the email it will need to create (and store) a verification token (likely a UUID) and attach it to this link in the email, so that the link looks something like:

""https://api.myapp.example.com/v1/users/verify?vt=12345""

Where vt=12345 is the ""verification token"" (again likely a UUID). So the user clicks this link and my GET v1/users/verify endpoint looks at the token, somehow confirms its valid, and makes some DB updates to ""activate"" the user. They can now log in.
Similar scenarios for when a user wants to unsubscribe from receiving email, or when they can't remember their password and need to recover it so that they can log in.
Unsubscribe
User wants to stop receiving emails but still wants to use the app. They click an ""Unsubscribe"" link in a weekly newsletter we send them. This link needs to contain some kind of similar ""unsubscribe token"" that, like the verification token above, is generated + stored on the server, and is used to authenticate the user's request to unsubscribe from email.
Recover Password
Here the user has forgotten their password and needs to recover it. So at the login screen they click the ""Forgot my password"" link, and are presented with a form where they must fill out their email address. Server sends an email to that address. They check this email and it contains a link to a form where they can enter their new password. This link needs to contain a ""reset password token"" that -- like the verification token above -- is generated + stored on the server, and is used to authenticate the user's request to change their password.
So here we have three very similar problems to solve, all requiring the use of what I'm calling ""one-time only (OTO) security tokens"". These OTO tokens:

Must be generated server-side and persisted (maybe to a security_tokens table)
Must be something that can be attached to links that we'll expose from inside of emails
Must only be valid one time: once they click it, the token is ""used"" and cannot be reused

My question
The solution I came up was simple...almost too simple.
For the tokens I am just generating random UUIDs (36-char) and storing them to a security_tokens table that has the following fields:
[security_tokens]
---
id (PK)
user_id (FK to [users] table)
token (the token itself)
status (UNCLAIMED or CLAIMED)
generated_on (DATETIME when created)

When the server creates them they are ""UNCLAIMED"". When the user clicks a link inside the table they are ""CLAIMED"". A background worker job will run periodically to clean up any CLAIMED tokens or to delte any UNCLAIMED tokens that have ""expired"" (based on their generated_on fields). The app will also ignore any tokens that have been previously CLAIMED (and have just not yet been cleaned up).
I think this solution would work, but I'm not a super security guy and I'm worried that this approach:

Possibly leaves my app open to some type of attack/exploit; and
Possibly reinvents the wheel when some other solution might work just as well

Like for the 2nd one above I'm wondering if I should be using a hash/HMAC/JWT-related mechanism instead of a dead simple UUID. Maybe there's some smart crypto/security folks who found a way to make these tokens contain CLAIM status and expiration date themselves in a secure/immutable fashion, etc.
","You're on the right lines
I have a very similar method in my application based on what I want it to do. I have a table containing each user (a Users table) which I can use to reference each individual account and perform actions based on their identity. There are a lot of security threats to mitigate by adding in user accounts and self-management options. Here's how I combat a few of these vulnerabilities.
Verifying your email
When a user signs up, the server should use the RNGCryptoServiceProvider() class to generate a random salt with sufficient length that it could never realistically be guessed. Then, I hash the salt (on it's own) and apply base64 encoding to it so that it can be added to a Url. Send the completed link to the user via email, and be sure to store that hash against the relevant UserId in the Users table.
The user sees a nice and neat ""Click here to validate your email address"" in their inbox and can click on the link. It should redirect to a page that accepts an optional url parameter (such as mywebsite.com/account/verifyemail/myhash and then check the hash server-side. The site can then check the hash against the activation hashes it has stored in the database. If it matches a record, then you should mark the Users.EmailVerified column to true and commit to the table. Then, you can delete that Verification record entry from the table.
Well done, you've successfully verified a user's email address is real!
Reset password
Here, we implement a similar method. But instead of a Verification record, we're better off storing our record in a PasswordResetRequest table, and do not delete records - this allows you to see whether or not a password was reset and when. Each time the user requests a password reset, you should display an anonymous message such as ""An email was sent to your primary email address containing further instructions"". Even if one was not sent or the account doesn't exist, it stops a potential attacker from enumerating usernames or email addresses to see if they are registered with your service. Again, if they are real, send a link using the same method as before.
The users opens their email address and clicks on the link. They are then redirected to a reset page such as mywebsite.com/account/resetpassword/myhash. The server then runs the hash in the url against the database and returns a result if it is real. Now, this is the tricky part - you shouldn't keep these active for long. I'd recommend a column linking the hash to the Users.UserId, one called ExpiraryDateTime which contains something like Datetime.Now.AddMinutes(15) (which makes it easier to work with later), and one called IsUsed as a boolean (false by default).
On clicking a link, you should check to see if a link exists. If not, give them them to the default ""There was a problem with that link. Please request a new one"" text. However, if the link is valid, you should check that Used == false because you don't want people using the same link more than once. If it's not used, great! Let's check to see if it's still valid. The easiest way would be a simple if (PasswordResetRequest.ExpiraryDateTime < DateTime.Now) - if the link is still valid, then you can proceed with the password reset. If not, it means it was generated a while ago and you shouldn't allow it to be used anymore. Seriously, some sites will still allow you to generate a link today and if your email is hacked 1 month from now, you can still use the reset links!
I should also mention that each time the user requests a password reset, you should check the existing records in the table for a valid link. If one is valid (meaning it can still be used) then you should instantly invalidate it. Replace the hash with some assistive text like ""Invalid: User requested new reset link"". This also lets you know they've requested more than one link whilst also invalidating their link. You could also mark it as Used if you really wanted to just to prevent people from trying to use expired links by being smart and sneaking the whole ""Invalid: User requested new reset link"" as an encoded URL into their browsers. You should never have more than one reset link active for the same account - ever!
Unsubscribing
For this, I'd have a simple flag in the database that determines whether or not a user can receive promotional offers and newsletters etc. So a Users.SubscribedToNewsletter would suffice. They should be able to log in and change this in their Email Settings or Communication Preferences etc.
Some code examples
This is my RNGCryptoServiceProvider code in C#
public static string GenerateRandomString(RNGCryptoServiceProvider rng, int size)
{
    var bytes = new Byte[size];

    rng.GetBytes(bytes);

    return Convert.ToBase64String(bytes);
}

var rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();
var randomString = GenerateRandomSalt(rng, 47); // This will end up being a string of almost entirely random bytes

Why do I use RNGCryptoServiceProvider?
The RNGCryptoServiceProvider() (which is a C# class in their Security library) allows you to generate a seemingly random string of bytes based on entirely random and non-reproducable events. Classes like the Random() still need to use some sort of internal data to generate a number based on predictable algorithmic events such as current date and time. The RNGCryptoServiceProvider() uses things like cpu temperatures, number of running processes, etc. all to create something random that can't be reproduced. This allows for the final byte array to be as random as possible.
Why do I Base64 encode it?
Base64 encoding will result in a string containing only numbers and letters. This means there will be no symbols or encoded characters within the text and therefore it is safe to use in a URL. This isn't so much a security feature, but it does allow you to only allow numbers and letters within the parameters of the method, and filter out or reject any input that doesn't match this standard. For example, filtering out any inputs that contain the chevrons < and > should allow you to prevent XSS.
Something to keep in mind
You should ALWAYS assume that the link containing your hash is invalid until you perform each check on it to ensure it passes requirements. So you can do your various if statements but unless you pass every single one, you leave your default next action to some form of error for the user. To clarify, I should check that the password reset link is valid, then not used, then still within the time window, and then perform my reset actions. Should it fail to pass any of these requirements, the default action should be to give the user an error saying that it is an invalid link.
Notes for others
Since I'm pretty confident this isn't the only way to do this, I'd just like to declare that this is how I've done it for years which has never failed me and has gotten my company through several extensive pentests.

","Turns outs it's because I wasn't replying to the client anywhere in the callback with something like:
res.sendStatus(200); or res.sendStatus(500); etc...

It's weird because my the code in my callbacks executes fine (even without ever replying to the client) but apparently
if the node parser realises there is a req.on() and no reply to the client, either inside or outside of it, it will ignore the req.on(..) which makes no sense really... Either the whole thing should break or none of it if a reply to the client is missing.

HMAC uses secret key and what I want is, that each user of application has it's own secret key. Now the thing is how do I transfer secret in a safe manner between API and mobile device initially.
Of course all communication will be through t SSL. But is it safe to send client secret from server to mobile client when connecting for the first time over the wire? 
Or I should use one secret and store it with mobile client, which could be easily reverse-engineered?
Or maybe there are other and better ways to do it?

"22683952","Security issue, HMAC in header vs https, or both?","I'm setting up a server which an android app and an iPhone app will connect to. And I'm wondering what type of security is more secure for sending/requesting data?
Currently I generate a HMAC-SHA256 of the content I'm sending to the server in the header to verify its integrity. 
But I'm wondering if its more secure to use a https connection instead? If I use https, could I skip the HMAC?
I would like to know the differences in security, which is more secure? 
And also, if I'm using either is it better to use both for an extra layer of security?
","Quick answer to your questions: SSL if used properly should give you more security guarantees than HMAC. So, usually SSL can be used in a way that removes the need for HMAC. 
HMAC provides integrity as well as authenticity. Assuming the client and the server use pre-shared symmetric keys to calculate the HMACs, one side can be sure that the device on the other end has the secret key. This provides authenticity of both server and client.
What is missing in this picture (with just HMAC) is confidentiality. What is the nature of data exchanged between the server and client? Is there any sensitive user data being transferred during the communication that you don't want a man-in-the-middle to see? If so, then you may want to use SSL. 
SSL gives you confidentiality (among other things). Meaning that you can be sure that you have a secured end-to-end connection and no man-in-the-middle can see what data is being exchanged between the server and client. However, common SSL usage does not include client machine authentication. Fro example, your web browser checks for Paypal's authenticity when you go to their https webpage. But the Paypal server does not ask your browser to send any certificate from your side. 
Since you are comparing SSL with HMAC, I am assuming you care about authenticity of both sides. So, use SSL with both server and client authentication. This basically means that both of them would ask for each other's certificates and check different aspects of the certificates (i.e. common name, certificate issuer etc.). You can create your own certificate issuer to sign these certificates. 
If you are making an app for AppStore or Google Play that users can simply install and start using, you may want to think through how the client side certificates will be generated, signed or who will sign them. You can remove the need for client side certificate (and signing) by adopting a model similar to GitHub's, where the user manually informs the server of trusted public keys to authenticate devices. But you can probably see how this process might not be user friendly.

This question is pertaining the usage of the HMAC routines in OpenSSL.
Since Openssl documentation is a tad on the weak side in certain areas, profiling has revealed that using the:

               int key_len, const unsigned char *d, int n,
               unsigned char *md, unsigned int *md_len);

From here, shows 40% of my library runtime is devoted to creating and taking down HMAC_CTX's behind the scenes.

HMAC_CTX_init() initialises a HMAC_CTX
  before first use. It must be called.
HMAC_CTX_cleanup() erases the key and
  other data from the HMAC_CTX and
  releases any associated resources. It

These two function calls are prefixed with:

The following functions may be used if
  the message is not completely stored
  in memory

My data fits entirely in memory, so I choose the HMAC function -- the one whose signature is shown above.
The context, as described by the man page, is made use of by using the following two functions:

HMAC_Update() can be called repeatedly
  with chunks of the message to be
  authenticated (len bytes at data).
HMAC_Final() places the message
  authentication code in md, which must
  have space for the hash function
  output.


The Scope of the Application
My application generates a authentic (HMAC, which is also used a nonce), CBC-BF encrypted protocol buffer string. The code will be interfaced with various web-servers and frameworks Windows / Linux as OS, nginx, Apache and IIS as webservers and Python / .NET and C++ web-server filters. 
The description above should clarify that the library needs to be thread safe, and potentially have resumeable processing state -- i.e., lightweight threads sharing a OS thread (which might leave thread local memory out of the picture).

The Question
How do I get rid of the 40% overhead on each invocation in a (1) thread-safe / (2) resume-able state way ? (2) is optional since I have all of the source-data present in one go, and can make sure a digest is created in place without relinquishing control of the thread mid-digest-creation. So,
(1) can probably be done using thread local memory -- but how do I resuse the CTX's ? does the HMAC_final() call make the CTX reusable ?. 
(2) optional: in this case I would have to create a pool of CTX's.
(3) how does the HMAC function do this ? does it create a CTX in the scope of the function call and destroy it ? 
Psuedocode and commentary will be useful.
","If you aren't trying to restrict your dependencies, you could choose a HMAC implementation that is self contained and requires that the user explicitly control all the aspects that OpenSSL is, in it's documentation, vague about.

  NULL, in which case the existing one

(Emphasis mine).  So this means that you can initialise a HMAC_CTX with HMAC_CTX_Init() once, then keep it around to create multiple HMACs with, as long as you don't call HMAC_CTX_cleanup() on it and you start off each HMAC with HMAC_Init_ex().
So yes, you should be able to do what you want with a HMAC_CTX in thread-local memory.

The reference provides example for sha1, sha256 and sha512 algorithm.  
I've found this nice example by Rob Swan (see the 8 digit example) that reproduces fine one test case (with sha1). But if I change the algorithm to sha256 or sha512 (and change the seeds too, according to the reference input data) I got different results from the reference's ones. 
May the hmac hash function of php be different from java's one? 
Thank you!
","* SOLUTION 
Here is a copy of the php implementation by Rob Swan I mentioned:
<?php

// Define your secret seed
// NB: this is a hexadecimal representation of the example
// ASCII string which is: 12345678901234567890
$secret_seed = ""3132333435363738393031323334353637383930"";

// Determine the time window as 30 seconds
$time_window = 30;

// Set the timestamp manually
$exact_time = 1111111109;

// Round the time down to the time window
$rounded_time = floor($exact_time/$time_window);

// Pack the counter into binary
$packed_time = pack(""N"", $rounded_time);

// Make sure the packed time is 8 characters long
$padded_packed_time = str_pad($packed_time,8, chr(0), STR_PAD_LEFT);

// Pack the secret seed into a binary string
$packed_secret_seed = pack(""H*"", $secret_seed);

// Generate the hash using the SHA1 algorithm
$hash = hash_hmac ('sha1', $padded_packed_time, $packed_secret_seed, true);

// NB: Note we have change the exponent in the pow function 
// from 6 to 8 to generate an 8 digit OTP not a 6 digit one 

// Extract the 8 digit number fromt the hash as per RFC 6238
$offset = ord($hash[19]) & 0xf;
$otp = (
    ((ord($hash[$offset+0]) & 0x7f) << 24 ) |
    ((ord($hash[$offset+1]) & 0xff) << 16 ) |
    ((ord($hash[$offset+2]) & 0xff) << 8 ) |
    (ord($hash[$offset+3]) & 0xff)
) % pow(10, 8);

// NB: Note that we are padding to 8 characters not 6 for this example

// Add any missing zeros to the left of the numerical output
$otp = str_pad($otp, 8, ""0"", STR_PAD_LEFT);

// Display the output, which should be 
echo ""This should display 07081804: "" . $otp;

?>

The key point is this line: 
$offset = ord($hash[19]) & 0xf;

This works fine under the hypotesis of using sha1 algorithm, which returns a 20 chars string. 
To abstract the line and make it compatible with any other algorithm change this line to:
$offset = ord($hash[strlen($hash)-1]) & 0xf;

Now you have a general and working php version of RFC 6238 totp calculation!

thx
","The best way is pretty subjective.
If you must store it on the client (you must, I assume), then it can't be secure, it just can't.
Putting that aside, the best way depends on your situation.
Are you trying to target older browsers? Then you can't use local storage.  
Since we've already removed security from the equation, your most far-reaching, cross-browser-compatible solution is to store it in a cookie.
That's also probably one of the easiest solutions, though certainly the least secure (since your only form of security here is obscurity, and cookies are... not obscure).

","Well the answer is, it depends. localStorage and cookies are not equivalent. Although they both can be used to store information on the client, they serve very specific goals. localStorage is meant to store application's data locally. It cannot be set directly from the server and is not sent to the server through HTTP headers either.
You may also have a look at sessionStorage.
However, cookies are typically created from the server (even if there's a JS API) through HTTP headers and they contain expiry information. Once set, they will be part of every client request's HTTP headers, allowing the server to access the information.
Both ways are probably equally secure since they both cannot be accessed from another domain. However if you are transmitting secure information you should probably do it through HTTPS as well.

When I compute the answer and submit it, it prompts me with another itteration of the question above (with a different value for x) and it says ""Didn't answer fast enough"". I've tried submitting answers as fast as I can with no avail, so there must be another way.

","I suggest that you write a script that parses the page and responds immediately, rather than trying to break the HMAC.
HMAC is an authentication code. Its purpose is to be secure, and it uses a secret key that you'd be very lucky to break or guess (in other words, that's not the way forward).

    hash.ComputeHash(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(password)));

now we intend to migrate to php.
so we face a problem for users when they want to back in. 
what php equivalent of the method should be used so that the hash values in the database would work?
eg password to encode is pa55w0rd 
the hash value gotten is oK9NOVhpTkxLoLfvh1430SFb5gw=
Thank you.
","In your C# app you generate the byte[] arrays in two different ways with a little bit different results. Your PHP script needs to emulate them exactly.
hash.Key = HexToByte(encryptionKey) You pass in a 16 characters long string and get an array of 8 bytes, just like hash.Key = new byte[]{0xAE, 0x09, 0xF7, 0x2B, 0x00, 0x7C, 0xAA, 0xB5 }; butstring password = ""pa55w0rd"";
byte[] b = Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(password)returns an array with 16 elements because of the Encoding.Unicode, like byte[] b = { 0x112, 0x0, 0x97, 0x0, 0x53, 0x0, 0x53, 0x0, 0x119, 0x0, 0x48, 0x0, 0x114, 0x0,0x100, 0x0 }
In your php script you can change the encoding of $password to utf-16le with $data = mb_convert_encoding($password, 'UTF16-LE') to achieve a similar result. hash_hmac() being unaware of any encoding will treat the string a 16 byte single-byte encoded string, just like hash.ComputeHash(byte[]) in .net does.
<?php
$password = ""pa55w0rd"";
$key = HexToBytes(""AE09F72B007CAAB5""); // 8 bytes, hex
// $to must be 'UTF-16LE'
// $from depends on the ""source"" of $password
$data = mb_convert_encoding($password, 'UTF-16LE', 'ASCII');
// I've saved this script as an ascii file -> the string literal is ASCII encoded
// therefore php's strlen() returns 8 for $password and 16 for $data
// this may differ in your case, e.g. if the contents of $password comes from a
// http-request where the data is utf-8 encoded. Adjust the $from parameter for
// mb_convert_encoding() accordingly
echo 'Debug: |data|=', strlen($data), ' |password|=', strlen($password), ""\n"";  
$h = HexToBytes(hash_hmac('sha1', $data, $key));
echo 'hmac-sha1: ', base64_encode($h);
function HexToBytes($s) {
  // there has to be a more elegant way...
  return join('', array_map('chr', array_map('hexdec', str_split($s, 2))));
}printsDebug: |data|=16 |password|=8

","It looks like you might have to install libraries to get sha256

ColdFusion 10 introduced the hmac() function for generating secure, hashed message authentication codes (HMAC). This function makes dealing with 3rd-Party APIs much easier. Before ColdFusion 10, however, you would need to dip down into the Java layer to access the security libraries. This ColdFusion component - Crypto.cfc - attempts to make access to such libraries easier and more concise.

","The CF documentation for hmac is sorely lacking useful details. The reason your code does not work is that hmac() returns a hexadecimal string. Whereas the PHP call to hash-hmac returns binary. As a result, your CF script is base64 encoding a completely different value. That is why the two results do not match. 
You need to decode the hex string into binary first. Then encode the binary as base64 and the results will match:
resultAsHex = hmac(""Well done is better than well said."", ""key"", ""HmacSHA256"");
finalValue = binaryEncode( binaryDecode(resultAsHex, ""hex""), ""base64"" );
writeDump( finalValue );

As an aside, toBase64() is deprecated. The docs recommend using binaryEncode for new applications.

","(By 'RS' I'm assuming you're speaking of RS256 and siblings, which are identifiers defined in RFC7518 for specific suites of asymmetric cryptography using RSA and SHA2 functions.)
These three algorithms are vastly different:

HMAC is an authentication algorithm often used alongside symmetric crypto, and it is digest agnostic; so you also need a library of digest / hash functions. ring is a pure-Rust high-quality implementation of various mainstream cryptographic algorithms, such as AES, HMAC, SHA1/2/3, AEAD, etc.
RSA is a cryptosystem for public key cryptography. Ring, mentioned above, supports modern configurations of the system. For other/older configurations, you may use the rust-openssl bindings, or native-tls.
Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding (not encryption). The base64 crate is the recommended way to handle it.

The question of how safe these are to use is highly subjective and depends on your use-case, and as such StackOverflow is not a good venue for that discussion.

","Short Answer
The body parser in express does not handle BigInt well, and things like order number which are passed as integer get corrupted. Apart from that certain values are edited such as URLs are originally sent as ""https://..."", which OP also found out from the other code.
To solve this, do not parse the data using body parser and instead get it as raw string, later on you can parse it with json-bigint to ensure none of it has been corrupted.
Long Answer
Although the answer by @bknights works perfectly fine, it's important to find out why this was happening in the first place.
For a webhook I made on the ""order_created"" event from Shopify I found out that the id of the request being passed to the body was different than what I was sending from my test data, this turned out to be an issue with body-parser in express which did not play nice with big integers.
Ultimately I was deploying something to Google cloud functions and the req already had raw body which I could use, but in my test environment in Node I implemented the following as a separate body parser as using the same body parser twice overwrote the raw body with JSON
var rawBodySaver = function (req, res, buf, encoding) {
    if (buf && buf.length) {
      req.rawBody = buf.toString(encoding || 'utf8');
    }
}
app.use(bodyParser.json({verify: rawBodySaver, extended: true}));

@client_id = ""asdkasdlda""
@secret = ""3fdsdsfxds""

binary_key = Base64.decode64(@secret)

params.update({""client"" => @client_id})
path = uri_path + ""?"" + params.collect{|k,v| ""#{k}=#{v}""}.inject{|initial,cur| initial + ""&"" + cur}

digest = Base64.encode64(digest).gsub(/[+\/]/, {""+"" => ""-"", ""/"" => ""_""}).delete(""="")
return ""#{path}&sig=#{digest}""

So, this code generates sig and path. we send request to server in following way:
/api/v1/customers/sign_in.json?user[email]=amit1656789@gmail.com&user[password]=[FILTERED]&client=asdkasdlda&sig=JSdP5xUHhgS8ZbKApBOIlsJKg_Q

Now, on server side, i want to decode this params[""sign""] into app_id, secret_key and path means reverse process of above code. But i am not found any reverse process of this. Means 
(app_id, secret, path) =>  ""signature""
""signature""      =>   (app_id, secret, path) /* Here i stuck */

","First thing you should know:

""signature"" => (app_id, secret, path)

This is not possible. It is not how MACs of any kind work. The signature does not contain the data. Signatures are meant to be sent alongside the message that they sign.
For secure HMAC, you should never send the secret with the message that you sign. It is also not possible to figure out a secret from the signature, except by repeatedly guessing what the value might be.

The usual way to confirm a signature is to follow the same process on the server, signing the same message, using the same secret (which the server should already have), and compare the signatures. You have made it difficult for yourself because you have signed the params as you sent them, and then put the signature on the end. You have to re-construct the message.
First, you need to use whatever web server library you can to get the request URI including the query string
signed_uri = ""/api/v1/customers/sign_in.json?user[email]=amit1656789@gmail.com&user[password]=[FILTERED]&client=asdkasdlda&sig=JSdP5xUHhgS8ZbKApBOIlsJKg_Q""

Then split it into the message and its signature (I'll leave that to you, but just a regular expression ought to work):
message = ""/api/v1/customers/sign_in.json?user[email]=amit1656789@gmail.com&user[password]=[FILTERED]&client=asdkasdlda""

signature = ""JSdP5xUHhgS8ZbKApBOIlsJKg_Q""

To decode this signature back to the original digest (for easy comparison), just reverse the replace and encoding you did at the end on the client:
client_digest = Base64.decode64( 
  signature.gsub(/[-_]/, {""-"" => ""+"", ""_"" => ""/""}) )

Then on the server (where you should already have a value for @secret), calculate what you expect the signature to be:
@secret = '3fdsdsfxds'
binary_key = Base64.decode64(@secret)

server_digest = HMAC::SHA1.new(binary_key).update( message ).digest

if server_digest == client_digest
  puts ""The message was signed correctly""
else
  puts ""ERROR: The message or signature is not correct!""

"9562366","Confused how a client and a server using AES and Hmac will verify each other","The scenario is this: I have a client and server talking. Here is the standard idea:

Use Diffie-Hellman to generate a secret key between the client and server.
Use this secret key for AES/CTR/PKCS7Padding cipher on both client and server.
Use Hmac on the original message
Encrypt the Hmac message with AES cipher

So this would allow the client and server to talk securely. 
The relevant code example I'm looking at is the tutorial here: Tampered message with HMac, encryption with AES in CTR mode : Advanced Encryption Standard « Security « Java Tutorial
I'm able to generate the secret key for both the client and server. I'm able to encrypt this using Hmac and AES. Because encryption and decryption happen independently, I am unsure how to retrieve the relevant information required for decryption. 
Here is the section I'm confused on:
cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key, ivSpec);

byte[] plainText = cipher.doFinal(cipherText, 0, ctLength);
int messageLength = plainText.length - hMac.getMacLength();

hMac.init(hMacKey);
hMac.update(plainText, 0, messageLength);

byte[] messageHash = new byte[hMac.getMacLength()];

If the client sends an encrypted message, how does the server retrieve the ivSpec, hMac.getMacLength(), and hMacKey? These items are required on the server to decrypt the message from the client.
I understand that the Initialization Vector (IV) can be retained from the ciphertext since it's appended to the beginning of the resulting ciphertext (I think I'll have to add it in manually since I don't think AES cipher does that?). However, the hMacKey and hMac length used to verify the message integrity remains a mystery. 
On a last note, can someone explain what the purpose of this line is? Is this for encryption or decryption?
     cipherText[9] ^= '0' ^ '9';`

","First, for this kind of thing use SSL if your doing it for real. For educational purposes, this stuff is cool.
As others have said, this is an example that proves HMAC works when the cipher text is tampered with.  Hence the cipherText[9] ^= '0' ^ '9';
In order to use HMAC, you have to verify that the message authentication tag (whats returned  by hmac) you got with your cipher text  matches the one you are supposed to have. To do this in this code you: 1) decrypt the message using the key you negotiated, 2) compute the hmac of that text using a different key you negotiated and then 3) compare that the two are the same.
Since you know those keys, you can decrypt the message and compute the mac. The mac length  b the way, is a fixed property of the hmac function and is publicly known.
Because you must have the key to generate the valid tag, if they match, then the message is authentic.
As a note, this code is likely insecure since you need to MAC the ciphertext, not plaintext. If you don't, you end up with problems like the Padding oracle attack that broke a bunch of sites secure cookie implementations. Use SSL for these kind of things.

Please help!
","Yes, ""⊕"" is the symbol for ""exclusive or"".

Remember: once you compute the final hash, DO NOT use an ordinary string comparison to check if a hash is correct.  This WILL allow attackers to sign arbitrary messages.
Note that 0x5c * blocksize is probably not what you are looking for, since that multiplies 0x5c by blocksize.  You want to create an array of length blocksize containing 0x5c in each position.
Note that you must pad with zero bytes, not the character ""0"".  So key = key .. ""0"" is wrong.  It should be key = key .. ""\0"", or however you create NUL bytes in Lua.

8e7f5de43a6900867667b9361af38df32fc58e54d7ce9a02

now I modify the data variable in the script as follows:

use Digest::SHA qw(hmac_sha512_hex);
use warnings;

$data={'method' => 'test', 'value' => 21};

how do I correct this?
","The data that you pass into hmac_sha512_hex is interpreted as a string. You are passing it as a reference to a hash. You can verify this by printing the value of $data before passing it into the function.
Your reference is just a unique identifier for your hash. Perl doesn't guarantee that you'll get the same hash reference for the same data in different runs of your program. You are therefore passing different values into hmac_sha512_hex which will obviously give you different output.
If you want your output to be the same, then you need to find a way to pass the same string into the function each time. One simple approach might be to use the string that you get back from Data::Dumper's Dumper function.
Update: If you use Data::Dumper, then you'll need to set $Data::Dumper::Sortkeys to a true value.

I've run into a problem where I'm supposed to translate an api key in hex to ascii and use it as secret, but I just can't get the output to be the same as python.
>>> import hmac
>>> import hashlib
>>> apiKey = ""76b02c0c4543a85e45552466694cf677937833c9cce87f0a628248af2d2c495b""

If I've understood the material online this is supposed to represent the hex string in ascii characters.
Now to the powershell script:
$apikey = '76b02c0c4543a85e45552466694cf677937833c9cce87f0a628248af2d2c495b';

$hexstring = """"

for($i=0; $i -lt $apikey.Length;$i=$i+2){
    $hexelement = [string]$apikey[$i] + [string]$apikey[$i+1]
    $hexstring += [CHAR][BYTE][CONVERT]::toint16($hexelement,16)
}

That outputs the following:
v°,♀EC¨^EU$fiLöw?x3ÉÌè⌂
b?H¯-,I[

They are almost the same, but not quite and using them as secret in the HMAC generates different results. Any ideas?

Stating the obvious: The key in this example is no the real key.

Update:
They look more or less the same, but the encoding of the output is different. I also verified the hex to ASCII in multiple online functions and the powershell version seems right. 
Does anyone have an idea how to compare the two different outputs?
Update 2:
I converted each character to integer and both Python and Powershell generates the same numbers, aka the content should be the same.

","ASCII encoding support characters from this code point range 0–127. Any character outside this range, encoded with byte 63, which correspond to ?, in case you decode byte array back to string. So, with your code, you ruin your key by applying ASCII encoding to it. But if what you want is a byte array, then why do you do Hex String -> ASCII String -> Byte Array instead of just Hex String -> Byte Array?
Here is PowerShell code, which generate same results, as your Python code:
function GenerateToken {
    param($apikey, $url, $httpMethod, $queryparameters, $postData)

    $datastring = -join @(
        $httpMethod
        $url
        $queryparameters

    $hmacsha.Key = @($apikey -split '(?<=\G..)(?=.)'|ForEach-Object {[byte]::Parse($_,'HexNumber')})

    [BitConverter]::ToString($hmacsha.ComputeHash([Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($datastring))).Replace('-','').ToLower()
}

$postData = ""{param1: 123, param2: 456}""

GenerateToken -url $apiEndpoint -httpMethod ""GET"" -queryparameters $queryParameters -postData $postData -apiKey $apiKey

I also fix some other errors in your PowerShell code. In particular, arguments to GenerateToken function call. Also, I change ASCII to UTF8 for $datastring encoding. UTF8 yields exactly same bytes if all characters are in ASCII range, so it does not matter in you case. But if you want to use characters out of ASCII range in $datastring, than you should choose same encoding, as you use in Python, or you will not get the same results.

"44373395","Duo Security API with python client","I'm trying to work with Duo's python client (https://github.com/duosecurity/duo_client_python) and I believe I'm simply missing something with my novice python eyes.  I somehow need to authenticate my requests to the API using an HMAC signature -- which I've not worked with before but seems trivial to generate (they even provide a python function).  Doc here https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#authentication
I'm at a loss as to HOW to craft this signature for authentication, prior to passing my request to the API.  From https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#authentication:

The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication to authenticate requests. Use your >Duo application’s integration key as the HTTP Username.
Generate the HTTP Password as an HMAC signature of the request. This will >be different for each request and must be re-generated each time.

It then goes into which parameters are added and necessary for the HMAC signature to be generated properly.  I understand this part.  My issue is how and when to pass the HMAC signature that I generate.  As the Duo doc doesn't specifically go into that, I'm thinking that this is something I should already know [were I not such a python novice].
For example, simple auth calls work fine (as they need no authentication):
root@box:~# python -m duo_client.client --ikey XXXXXXXX --skey XXXXXXXX --host XXXXXXXX.duosecurity.com --method GET --path /auth/v2/check 200 OK
{
""response"":
{ ""time"": 1496437236 }
,
""stat"": ""OK""
}
However, calls using admin require authentication, and thus fail with:
root@box:~# python -m duo_client.client --ikey XXXXXXXX --skey XXXXXXXX --host XXXXXXXX.duosecurity.com --method GET --path /admin/v1/users signature=XXXXXXXX
401 Unauthorized
{
    ""code"": 40103,
    ""message"": ""Invalid signature in request credentials"",
    ""stat"": ""FAIL""
}
Thanks in advance for any insight!
==EDIT==
So I thought I'd post the function that Duo provide for creating the signature, which appears similar to what is happening in the StackOverflow question I found that I thought might help (Python, HTTPS GET with basic authentication).  From https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#authentication:

def sign(method, host, path, params, skey, ikey):
    """"""
    Return HTTP Basic Authentication (""Authorization"" and ""Date"") headers.
    method, host, path: strings from request
    params: dict of request parameters

    """"""

    # create canonical string
    now = email.Utils.formatdate()
    canon = [now, method.upper(), host.lower(), path]
    args = []
    for key in sorted(params.keys()):
        val = params[key]
        if isinstance(val, unicode):
            val = val.encode(""utf-8"")
        args.append(
            '%s=%s' % (urllib.quote(key, '~'), urllib.quote(val, '~')))
    canon.append('&'.join(args))
    canon = '\n'.join(canon)

    # sign canonical string
    sig = hmac.new(skey, canon, hashlib.sha1)
    auth = '%s:%s' % (ikey, sig.hexdigest())

    # return headers
    return {'Date': now, 'Authorization': 'Basic %s' % base64.b64encode(auth)}

I've used the above function in a simple script to print out (just so I can visualize) what should be getting passed within the script I'll create to server our needs -- I added the function to a script and used print by adding the following:

# Printing Signature Headers ### TESTING ###
print sign('GET', 'XXXhostXXX', '/admin/v1/users', 'XXXparamXXX', 'XXXskeyXXX', 'XXXXikeyXXXX')

However, I'm getting this error:

"19861729","How to input key with ""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1"" in Java","I am working on a Java project where I must ensure the confidentiality of users password saved in a plaintext file. 
To do so, I will write only a hash of the password in the file. More specifically, my intention is to write the hash of the password and a random salt, plus the random salt itself, to avoid the use of rainbow and lookup tables. I also want to use key-stretching with PBKDF2, to make the computation of the hash computationally expensive. 
Finally, I would like to use a keyed hash algorithm, HMAC, for a final layer of protection.
I am trying to implement my thoughts in a Java code, and I have found some examples of the operations that I have presented above:
private static byte[] pbkdf2(char[] password, byte[] salt, int iterations, int bytes)
    throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException
{
    PBEKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password, salt, iterations, bytes * 8);
    SecretKeyFactory skf = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1"");
    return skf.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();
}

The thing that I really cannot understand is how to input my secret key as the key used by the HMAC algorithm, as it doesn't seem an input to the function. I have looked through the Java documentation, but I cannot find a solution to my question.
","If your talking about the HMAC function used internally by PBKDF2 for key streching, you don't need to supply a key, it will create one from the inputs.
If you wanted to use PBKDF2 to create key material for an HMAC function, then below works.
You init a Mac function the same way you'd do it with a cipher.
Using your pbkdf2 method above.
byte[] key = pbkdf2(password, salt, 1000, 16)
Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA1"");
mac.init(new SecretKeySpec(key, ""HmacSHA1"");

byte[] macResult = mac.doFinal(...);

"8610730","How do I link my MS Visual Studio project against OpenSSL static libraries?","Before starting on this project, I had the false impression I was proficient in coding and using Visual Studio 2010. I realize now I was under just full of myself.
My platform is development box is 64bit Windows 7, but I need to build for both 64 and 32 bit platforms.  I'm using VS 2010 and OpenSSL 1.0.0e, though if need be, I can use another one.  I'm trying to create a static library (*.lib) that will be included into a larger project by other developers.  The *.lib seems to compile, but obviously things are not all well since the test program breaks.
I cannot use *.dlls with my program, this has come from on high, therefore I've been trying to statically link my library to libeay32.lib and ssleay32.lib.  I've only just begun and like to start slow when using something new, so the only two functions I'm trying to call from SSL are HMAC and EVP_sha512:
HMAC(EVP_sha512(), key, keyLen, lpBufferAddr, dwCurBufSize, hashOut, &len);
I acknowledge I may be doing it entirely wrong, but there you have it. Honestly, the only thing I need are the crypto functions, and HMAC functions. I could probably use something else, but I've been told to use OpenSSL. Anyway, moving on....
When building the test program that links to my library project (which in turn links to the two OpenSSL libraries), I get the following linking errors:
error LINK2019: unresolved external symbol _HMAC@28 referenced in function ""public: int _thiscall etc""
error LINK2019: unresolved external symbol _EVP_sha512@28 referenced in function ""public: int _thiscall etc""

I include both libraries in ""Additional Dependencies"", and have included their directory in ""Additional Library Dependencies"".
Can anyone help me with this? I've been pouring over this and have come to the unfortunate conclusion I'm a dunce.  Creating static libs from OpenSSL was difficult enough for me, I  admit, and I'm not even convinced I succeeded with x64.  Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated.
","OpenSSL is C-based library and is compiled with /Gd option. All the functions are with __cdecl calling convention.
Add __cdecl before the functions which you are using. (Note that there is no need to recompile the library after adding __cdecl since the library is compiled with this option).
e.g. if you are using SSL_connect
 int __cdecl SSL_connect(SSL * ssl);

I think, it will solve your problem.
In few cases, you many need to wrap the function declaration under extern ""C"". But as far as I know, in this case, you should not need to do this.

","You are calculating a HMAC without using your key.

","The encoding you need to use is a variant of Base64 encoding called base64url.
From wikipedia:

Using standard Base64 in URL requires encoding of '+', '/' and '='
  characters into special percent-encoded hexadecimal sequences ('+'
  becomes '%2B', '/' becomes '%2F' and '=' becomes '%3D'), which makes
  the string unnecessarily longer.
For this reason, modified Base64 for URL variants exist, where the '+'
  and '/' characters of standard Base64 are respectively replaced by '-'
  and '_', so that using URL encoders/decoders is no longer necessary
  and have no impact on the length of the encoded value, leaving the
  same encoded form intact for use in relational databases, web forms,
  and object identifiers in general. Some variants allow or require
  omitting the padding '=' signs to avoid them being confused with field
  separators, or require that any such padding be percent-encoded. Some
  libraries will encode '=' to '.'.

"38904954","HttpContent.ReadAsByteArrayAsync() fails without error inside DelegatingHandler","I'm trying to implement HMAC security for an API. Everything works fine until I try to post a file.
The HMAC solution can be found here - https://github.com/gavinharriss/WebAPI.HMAC - it's a fork from the original to allow GET requests as well as POST requests.
The code to attach a file:
var requestContent = new MultipartFormDataContent();
var fileContent = new ByteArrayContent(file);
requestContent.Add(fileContent, ""file"", filename);

if I immediately call HttpContent.ReadAsByteArrayAsync() there is no issue, the byte array is available.
However, the HMAC HttpClient (HMACHttpClient) implements a DelegatingHandler (HMACDelegatingHandler) in order to attach the HMAC header to requests.
In the HMACDelegatingHandler the request is passed along as a HttpRequestMessage from which the HttpRequestMessage.Content property is used in a helper to build the HMAC signature.
When building the signature, the following code is called from a helper class:
private static async Task<byte[]> ComputeHash(HttpContent httpContent)
{
    using (var md5 = MD5.Create())
    {
        byte[] hash = null;
        if (httpContent != null)
        {
            var content = await httpContent.ReadAsByteArrayAsync(); // <-- Fails here
            if (content.Length != 0)
            {
                hash = md5.ComputeHash(content);
            }
        }
        return hash;
    }
}

When stepping through the code the var content = await httpContent.ReadAsByteArrayAsync() line is hit, then nothing, no error. The requests just seems to go poof but everything is still running and the HttpClient request never gets sent.
Any ideas what's going on?
","Having tested this with various sizes of file, I found the issue arose when files got around the 50,000 byte mark.
This post provided a solution: HttpContent.ReadAsStringAsync causes request to hang (or other strange behaviours).
If you replace erroring line in HMACHelper (line 66):
var content = await httpContent.ReadAsByteArrayAsync();

with this:
var ms = new MemoryStream();
await httpContent.CopyToAsync(ms);
ms.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);

var content = ms.ToArray();

It should stop hanging.

I""m trying out some authentication code and want to know why the byte array I get from Rfc2898DeriveBytes needs to be converted to HEX and back to a byte array again for it to correctly initialise my HMACSHA1 object. I feel like I am doing something silly, or simply missing something obvious.
My client code is a javascript function based on crypto-js;
var key256bit = Crypto.PBKDF2(passwordEntered, saltBytes, 32, { iterations: 1000 }); 
var hmacBytes = Crypto.HMAC(Crypto.SHA1, url, key256bit, { asBytes: true });
var base64Hash = Crypto.util.bytesToBase64(hmacBytes);

My Server side code is as follows;
    Rfc2898DeriveBytes rfc2898 = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password,
                                              encoding.GetBytes(salt), 1000);
    byte[] key = rfc2898.GetBytes(32);

    // Don't think I should need to do this. 
    // However, it wont work if I initialise HMACSHA1 
    // with the rfc2898.GetBytes(32)
    string test = ByteArrayToString(key); 

    HMACSHA1 hmacSha1 = new HMACSHA1(encoding.GetBytes(test));

    byte[] computedHash = hmacSha1.ComputeHash(encoding.GetBytes(requestUri));
    string computedHashString = Convert.ToBase64String(computedHash);

My ByteArrayToString method which I nabbed from the web is;
private static string ByteArrayToString(byte[] ba)
{
    StringBuilder hex = new StringBuilder(ba.Length * 2);
    foreach (byte b in ba)
        hex.AppendFormat(""{0:x2}"", b);
    return hex.ToString();
}

So I can see that I get 32 bytes from my call to rfc2898.GetBytes(32). I converted that to HEX using the ByteArrayToString method to confirm it matches what I am seeing in my Javascript variable key256bit. Now my test variable is a string of length 64 and when I pass that to HMACSHA1's constuctor using encoding.GetBytes(test) it is a byte array of length 64.
The doco on crypto-js is a bit lacking, but I thought the call to Crypto.PBKDF2 with a param of 32 and it was creating a key of 32 bytes long (or 256 bits).
Any clarification is much appreciated.
","I suspect this is the root of the issue, in PBKDF2.js:
return options && options.asBytes ? derivedKeyBytes :
       options && options.asString ? Binary.bytesToString(derivedKeyBytes) :
       util.bytesToHex(derivedKeyBytes);

Because you haven't provided options for either asBytes or asString, it's converting the key to a hex representation - just as your C# code does. So at the moment you are using a 512 bit key, precisely because you're generating 2 bytes of ""used key"" from each byte of ""original key"".
I suspect that if you specify the asBytes option in the Javascript, it will just work without the extra hex part in the C# code.
Then again, I've never seen PBKDF2 before, so I could be way off base...

  of an empty string which is “d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e”.

then with this string you have to perform the equivalent to this Java code
Signature = Base64 (HMAC-SHA1 (server_secret_key, StringToSign));

where server_secret_key is a constant. Finally you have to plug that into an authorization header of this form
Authorization: VWS {provision_access_key}:{Signature}

Of cause you need to figure out the exact encoding of the different parts, e.g. the date. If just one bit is wrong in the input nothing works.

It works, I get a request from the API but I'm unable to verify the hmac sha1 signature provided in the request.

All notification requests are signed with Base64 encoded HMAC-SHA1

  as the message data. HTTP headers are not included in the signature.
  The headers X-Moves-Signature, X-Moves-Timestamp and X-Moves-Nonce
  contain the signature, timestamp and nonce values. The timestamp is a
  unix timestamp, seconds since Jan 01 1970 00:00:00 GMT.

My Implementation:
from hmac import new as hmac_new
from hashlib import sha1

def check_signature(signature, timestamp, nonce, client_secret, request_body):

Daisy Daisy give me your answer doare both pretty much equally secure (in this context) as a secret key used to add to the hash?
","Citing Wikipedia page on HMAC:

The cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the cryptographic strength of the underlying hash function, the size of its hash output, and on the size and quality of the key.

This means that completely random key, where every bit is randomly generated, is far better than set of characters.
The optimum size of the key is equal to block size. If the key is too short then it is padded usually with zeroes (which are not random). If the key is too long then its hash function is used. The length of hash output is anyway block size.
Use of visible characters as a key makes the key easier to guess as there are far less combinations of visible characters than if we allow for every possible combination of bits. For example:
There are 95 visible characters in ASCII (out of 256 combinations). If the block size is 16 bytes (HMAC_MD5) then there are 95^16 ~= 4.4*10^31 combinations. But for 16 bytes there are 3.4*10^38 possibilities. Attacker knowing that the key consists only of visible ASCII characters knows that he requires around 10 000 000 times less time than if he had to consider every possible combination of bits.
Summarizing I recommend use of cryptographic pseudo-random number generator to generate secret keys instead of coming up with your own keys.

Edit:
As martinstoeckli suggested if you have to you can use key-derivation-function to generate byte key of specified length from text password. This is much safer than converting plain text to bytes and using these bytes as a key directly. Nevertheless, there is nothing more secure than key consisting of random bytes.

","This doesn't answer the actual question, but note that with SHA3 you don't really need HMAC hashes. Unlike SHA1 and SHA2 and MD5, SHA3 is not vulnerable to length-extension attacks.
Therefore with SHA3 it would suffice to just prepend or append the secret key to your input.
Or, if you're paranoid of a single hash step becoming compromised (not to be expected in the foreseeable future, especially not with SHA3, but still) you could do something like SHA3(key+SHA3(key+data)) or SHA3(key+SHA3(key+data)+data) (obviously with ""+"" denoting binary concatenation).

","You can just edit hmac-sha3.js and change the outputLength to 256-bit instead of 512-bit.

Open hmac-sha3.js file, using your text editor.
Find ""{outputLength:512}"" and replace it with ""{outputLength:256}""

Then the hash output will be 256-bit in length.
To be sure that you did not messed up things, double check your 256-bit hmac-sha3 output with some test cases available on the internet, for example: http://www.di-mgt.com.au/hmac_sha3_testvectors.html

","Both the key and msg arguments to hmac.new() must be bytes objects. You are feeding it a str object, as that is what the urllib.parse.urlencode() function produces:

Convert [...] to a percent-encoded ASCII text string. If the resultant string is to be used as a data for POST operation with the urlopen() function, then it should be encoded to bytes, otherwise it would result in a TypeError.

So not only should your self.Secret be bytes, you need to encode the post_data element too, even more so since you'll be passing it to urlopen() for a POST operation:
post_data = urlencode(args).encode('ASCII')
sign = hmac.new(self.Secret, post_data, hashlib.sha512).hexdigest()

","You are searching through bytes (hash[0]) for a value (169) greater than the maximum value of a byte (127). That is one reason why your search never finishes. Values > 127 will never be there.
The next problem is that your String conversion pattern ""%02X "" introduces a space after the hex string. Let's say you search for 127... ""7F "" will never equal ""7F"", so again, your search will never finish, even for byte values within range.
For interest, try adding this to your code:
Outside the loop:
Set<Integer> foundBytes = new TreeSet<Integer>();

At the end of the loop:
if (hash[0] != whatIWant) {
    if (foundBytes.add((int)hash[0])) {
        System.out.printf(""[%3d] %s\n"", foundBytes.size(), foundBytes);
    }
}

If you set your search value to be greater than 127, you will notice that the foundBytes set quickly fills up with all the possible values of byte after which no more new bytes are found and the print statement is not invoked.
(Your code could be optimized in several ways BTW, but that is not the point of the question.)

(There's a lot of redundant repetition there)
The undefined symbols EVP_sha1 and HMAC are defined in libcrypto, for which
you need also to link libssl, but -lssl -lcrypto
are not among the library options you are passing to the linker. You need to add them.
I'm not familiar with QMake but I believe library options should be defined in 
LIBS If you generate a linker
commandline with -lssl -lcrypto following -lQtCore you should be all right.
I notice that -lssl -lcrypto appears in the commented-out setting:
#QMAKE_CFLAGS_RELEASE += -lssl -lcrypto

That wouldn't have worked, since it's setting options for the C Compiler in
release mode, not the linker. Likewise QMAKE_CXXFLAGS, which you say you
tinkered with, sets options for the C++ compiler, not the linker.

"8346202","How do you determine HTTP request parameter order when calculating HMACs?","I'm writing a Web service that is going to use HMAC for authentication. Quick overview: an HMAC is a message digest calculated using the body of a message along with a secret key. The sender calculates the HMAC and attaches it to the request, then the receiver calculates the message digest on receipt using the secret key, which it has on file. If the digests are the same, then the receiver can be sure that the message was sent by the person who they claim to be. 
My question is about the parameter order. Let's say the Web service request has three parameters, foo, bar and baz. The body of the HTTP POST will look something like:
foo=1&bar=2&baz=3&hmac=de7c9b85b8b78aa6bc8a7a36f70a90701c9db4d9

(The HMAC in this case is a fake example.)
Normally HTTP parameter order is not significant, but when it comes to calculating the hash, it is. Should the server take the raw incoming request, drop the ""hmac"" parameter which is, of course, not part of the hash calculation, and hash that? Or should there be an agreed upon order of parameters which must be followed in order for the hash to be calculated correctly?
The former approach puts a bit more of a burden on the implementor on the server side, but it's more robust. What I'm really asking about is the expectation of developers who are building things on the client side. Do they expect that things will just work regardless of what order the parameters?
","I would say that manipulating the body of the request after you have calculated a hash based on that body, which is significant to whether the request is accepted, is generally bad practice (for reasons that, I feel, are obvious). That HMAC should not be appended to the request body, but set in either a GET parameter, a cookie, or a custom header.
This also reduces the burden on the implementor on the server side for your first suggestion, and this is the path I would recommend.

Is it possible to decrypt it?  
","TL;DR: No.
A MAC function is also called a ""keyed hash function"". It is not an ""encryption"" in any meaning of the word.
It transforms a key and a plain text into an authentication tag. The same key + plain text result in the same tag, this property is used to check that the plain text was not modified.
HMAC is a MAC built on a hash function, in your case SHA-256. As long as the hash function is not broken, you can't get the plain text back, even if you know the key.
If there is only a small set of possible plain texts, you can of course do a brute-force attack, just trying each plain text with the key to see if the tag is matching. (If the key is also unknown but from a small set, you can also try to try all possible keys.)

"50615993","HMAC hashing with Base64 encoding with Javascript","I am working with Payeezy API to handle payment on a webapp, their API for purchase requires a HMAC of payload signed using api secret. An excerpt from the docs: 

Construct the data param by appending the parameters below in the same order as shown. a. apikey - API key of the developer. b. nonce - secure random number. c. timestamp - epoch timestamp in milliseconds. d. token - Merchant Token. e. payload - Actual body content passed as post request. Compute HMAC SHA256 hash on the above data param using the key below f. apiSecret - Consumer Secret token for the given api key Calculate the base64 of the hash which would be our required Authorization header value.

I found a library called jshashes on NPM and I tried to use their library to hash my header params, my code looks like this: 
const payload = {
        ""merchant_ref"": ""1-Sale"",
        ""transaction_type"": ""purchase"",
        ""method"": ""credit_card"",
        ""amount"": amount * 100,
        ""partial_redemption"": ""false"",
        ""currency_code"": ""USD"",
        ""credit_card"": {
          ""type"": type,
          ""cardholder_name"": cardholder_name,
          ""card_number"": card_number,
          ""exp_date"": exp_date,
          ""cvv"": cvv
        }
      }
      const data = apikey + nounce + timestamp + token + JSON.stringify(payload)
      const sha256 = new Hashes.SHA256()
      const shaData = sha256.b64_hmac(apiSecret, data)

The outcome compared to the sample hashed value looks like this:
//mine
beWtpCGDv/iBoAUDAThGFXIge9eli/Xtl7JIBuR1bd4= 


//payeezy sample 
NmUzMTNmYWU0YjExM2UxMmM0NjllZGI1NThjY2M5MmUzMzE3NTFlZmQ1NDQxYzAzMTgwMmIwNDQ0MWVmYTdhMw== 

from the looks of the character counts I could tell that my hashing process is not correct but I can't figure out where went wrong. 
I've seen similar questions being asked here but none answered, any help is appreciated.
ADDITION, I tried crypto library on Node.js:
const data = apikey + nounce + timestamp + token + JSON.stringify(payload)

  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha512', apiSecret)

  hmac.on('readable', () => {
    const data = hmac.read()
    if (data) {
      console.log(data.toString('base64'));
    }
  })

  hmac.write(data)
  hmac.end()

Same result, with only half the character length compared to the sample hashed value
UPDATE: After I used SHA512 on the data it finally returned a string that looks to have the same character length as the sample, but the validation is still not passing... 
","if you convert the base64 example from that site to a string


console.log(atob('NmUzMTNmYWU0YjExM2UxMmM0NjllZGI1NThjY2M5MmUzMzE3NTFlZmQ1NDQxYzAzMTgwMmIwNDQ0MWVmYTdhMw=='))



You get 
6e313fae4b113e12c469edb558ccc92e331751efd5441c031802b04441efa7a3

This is a 64 character (256 bit) hex string
So my guess is that they get the hex string HMAC, and base64 encode that - which seems awfully stupid, hex is safe to send as is, why make it 4/3rds larger!!
if they simply used the base64 of the HMAC, it'd only be 45 characters long!!
Instead they get the 64 character hex string and base64 encode that to get 88 characters!! strange design decision!!
So, your code should do the same
like
Data = Buffer.from(sha256.hex_hmac(apiSecret, data), 'utf-8').toString('base64');

not sure if there's a better way in node to convert hex encoded string to base64, but that works
And finally (actually this bit is just to ""match"" how the authorization is calculated on the example page as linked by the OP https://developer.payeezy.com/payeezy-api/apis/post/transactions-3) So, it's not necessary to make the payload larger for no reason)
Another point you need to know, the payload JSON needs to be in a specific format it seems ... 2 space indented ... again, this is a damned stupid waste of bandwidth ..  {""key"":1234} takes 12 characters 
{
  ""key"": 1234
}

takes 17
So, anyway, you need to do this:
JSON.stringify(payload,null, 2)

This last piece of the puzzle should make your code as follows
const data = apikey + nonce + timestamp + token + JSON.stringify(payload,null, 2)
const sha256 = new Hashes.SHA256()
const shaData = Buffer.from(sha256.hex_hmac(secret, data), 'utf-8').toString('base64');

"8773417","Problems with reproducing the same HMAC MD5 on Java and C","I am currently stumped on recreating an HMAC MD5 hash generated by a Java program on C. Any help, suggestions, correction and recommendation would be greatly appreciated.
The Java program creates the HMAC MD5 string (encoded to a base 16 HEX string which is 32 characters long) using UTF16LE and MAC; what I need is to recreate the same result on C program.
I am using the RSA source for MD5 and the HMAC-MD5 code is from RFC 2104 (http://www.koders.com/c/fidBA892645B9DFAD21A2B5ED526824968A1204C781.aspx)
I have ""simulated"" UTF16LE on the C implementation by padding every even byte with 0s. The Hex/Int representation seem to be consistent on both ends when I do this; but is this the correct way to do this? I figured this would be the best way because the HMAC-MD5 function call only allows for a byte array (no such thing as a double byte array call in the RFC2104 implementation but that's irrelevant).
When I run the string to be HMAC'd through - you naturally get ""garbage"". Now my problem is that not even the ""garbage"" is consistent across the systems (excluding the fact that perhaps the base 16 encoding could be inconsistent). What I mean by this is ""�����ԙ���,"" might be the result from Java HMAC-MD5 but C might give ""v ����?��!��{�  "" (Just an example, not actual data).
I have 2 things I would like to confirm:

Did padding every even byte with 0 mess up the HMAC-MD5 algorithms? (either because it would come across a null immediately after the first byte or whatever)
Is the fact that I see different ""garbage"" because C and Java are using different character encodings? (same machine running Ubuntu)

I am going to read through the HMAC-MD5 and MD5 code to see how they treat the byte array going in (whether or not the null even bytes is causing a problem). I am also having a hard time writing a proper encoding function on the C side to convert the resultant string into a 32 character hex string. Any input/help would be greatly appreciated. 
Update (Feb 3rd): Would passing signed/unsigned byte array alter the output of HMAC-MD5? The Java implementation takes a byte array (which is SIGNED); but the C implementation takes an UNSIGNED byte array. I think this might also be a factor in producing different results. If this does affect the final output; what can I really do? Would I pass a SIGNED byte array in C (the method takes an unsigned byte array) or would I cast the SIGNED byte array as unsigned?
Thanks!

","The problem is probably due to your naive creation of the UTF-16 string.   Any character greater than 0x7F (see unicode explanation) needs to be expanded into the UTF encoding scheme.
I would work on first getting the same byte string between the C and Java implementation as that is probably where your problem lies -- so I would agree with your assumption (1)
Have you tried to calculate the MD5 without padding the C-string, but rather just converting it to UTF -- you can use iconv to make experiments with the encoding.

Server-Side
And then on the server-side the following occurs to authenticate the request:

PUBLIC_KEY is used to lookup the SECRET_KEY in the DB.
SECRET_KEY is used to create an HMAC of the request object from the payload.
The signature hash sent in the payload is compared to the hash of the request object  created on the server. If they match, we move on to authenticating the timestamp.
Given that we can now trust the timestamp sent in the cleartext request object since it was included in the signature hash sent from the client, the timestamp is evaluated and the authentication is rejected if the request is too old. Otherwise, the request is authenticated.

So far as I understand, this is a secure method for signing and authentication requests sent over SSL. Is this correct?
Thanks in advance for any help.
Update on JSON Property Order

The order of properties when using JSON.stringify is essentially random, which could cause signature mis-matches.

Using this signing process over the past few weeks I haven't run into any hash mis-match issues due to the order of the properties in the JSON request object. I believe it's because I only stringify the request object literal once, right before the client-side hash is calculated. Then, the request object is in JSON format as part of the payload. Once received by the server, the hash is created directly from the JSON object received in the payload, there's no second JSON.stringify method invoked, so the signature always matches because the order of the properties is determined once, by the client. I'll keep looking into this though as it seems like a weak point, if not a security concern.
","JSON.stringify does not guarantee order of properties. For example, object
{
  a: 1,
  b: 2
}

could be serialized in two ways: {""a"":1,""b"":2} or {""b"":2,""a"":1}. They are the same from JSON point of view but they will result it different HMACs.
Imaging, that for signings your JSON.stringify produced first form, but for checking signature second one. Your signature check will fail although signature was valid.

Payload Packaging (Sent as cleartext via POST over SSL)
var payload = {
    request: request,
    publicKey : publicKey,
    signature : signature
}

Resultant Payload JSON Document
{

}

POST Request
MyAPI.post('/', payload, function(response){
    /// Handle any errors ...
    /// Do something with the result ...
    /// Inspect the request you sent ...
});

Server-Side
And then on the server-side the following occurs to authenticate the request:

PUBLIC_KEY is used to lookup the SECRET_KEY in the DB.
SECRET_KEY is used to create an HMAC of the request object from the payload.
The signature hash sent in the payload is compared to the hash of the request object  created on the server. If they match, we move on to authenticating the timestamp.
Given that we can now trust the timestamp sent in the cleartext request object since it was included in the signature hash sent from the client, the timestamp is evaluated and the authentication is rejected if the request is too old. Otherwise, the request is authenticated.

So far as I understand, this is a secure method for signing and authentication requests sent over SSL. Is this correct?
Thanks in advance for any help.
Update on JSON Property Order

The order of properties when using JSON.stringify is essentially random, which could cause signature mis-matches.

Using this signing process over the past few weeks I haven't run into any hash mis-match issues due to the order of the properties in the JSON request object. I believe it's because I only stringify the request object literal once, right before the client-side hash is calculated. Then, the request object is in JSON format as part of the payload. Once received by the server, the hash is created directly from the JSON object received in the payload, there's no second JSON.stringify method invoked, so the signature always matches because the order of the properties is determined once, by the client. I'll keep looking into this though as it seems like a weak point, if not a security concern.
","The only fishy thing I see here would be the JSON.stringify as posted in other comments, but you can use: 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-stable-stringify
That way you can have a deterministic hash for you signs.

"28845692","Using HMAC with SHA-1","I am attempting to implement HMAC using SHA-1 as the base. Using SHA-1 algorithm from bouncy castle, and implement the HMAC computation. Also to use SHA-1 to hash the input password to get the key for the HMAC algorithm.  I've been trying to do this for a few hours but I really have a poor understanding of HMAC.  If anyone has any tips on how to do this it would be appreciated.  My code below is my implementation of SHA1, via a library function call,  I'm essentially just trying to implement it with HMAC.

","I am not familiar with Bouncy Castle, but you can work out the HMAC-SHA1 without external libraries using only what is provided with Java SE:
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import javax.crypto.Mac;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

public String getHmacSha1(byte[] key, byte[] input) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
    SecretKeySpec signingKey = new SecretKeySpec(key, ""HmacSHA1"");

    Mac mac = null;
    mac = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA1"");
    mac.init(signingKey);
    byte[] digest = mac.doFinal(input);

    return Hex.encodeHexString(digest);
}

This is available since Java 1.4 according to the API.

How can this be secure considering that the secret key must be stored in plain sight in the JavaScript source deployed on the client ?

Each client should get their own key/secret which enables them access to the resources they are supposed to have access to.  This is effectively no different than a user knowing their own username and password.  Their user/pass combo only allows access to the resources they need.  The same should go for the key pair.

Anyone can take the key and issue similar requests to the server under the identity of the original client of the API. Isn't ""identity"" the problem that HMAC is supposed to solve ?

Yes, of course if someone gets your key and secret they can issue requests as if they came from you.  Simply don't give out your secret to others.  Having it in JavaScript doesn't matter at all.  Sure, the user can see it but unless they take that key and secret and put it somewhere else, it isn't a problem.
I have a system where a user logs in through normal means (username/password, OAuth, OpenID, etc.) and is immediately issued a key/secret for making API calls.  The client-side application uses this key/secret to actually do its work.  The issuance of this key/secret is done over HTTPS.  I wanted to use HMAC for my API since I wanted the user to be able to pre-sign requests to be used in the open.  This method enables me to keep HMAC for the usual administrative GUI as well.

Here is the authentication written in Python:
  message = str(nonce) + hmac_auth_key + relative_path + get_or_post_params_urlencoded
  signature = hmac.new(hmac_auth_secret, msg=message, digestmod=hashlib.sha256).hexdigest().upper()

And the parameters to create the HMAC message:
Nonce. A 63 bit positive integer, for example unix timestamp as milliseconds.

HMAC authentication key. This is the first one of a key/secret pair.

Relative path, for example /api/wallet/.

GET or POST parameters in their URL encoded format, for example foo=bar&baz=quux.

Here is how I am building the HMAC:
var milliseconds = (new Date).getTime();
var key = config.key;
var secret = config.secret;
var nonce = milliseconds.toString()


var message = nonce + key + 'api/myself';

var hmac_digest = crypto.createHmac(""sha256"", secret).update(message).digest('hex').toUpperCase();

"30464720","API Authentication using HMAC","I am looking for a decent method of authentication to use when writing a simple API for use within our internal systems. Other questions on Stack Overflow have suggested HMAC along with links to tutorials, which I went ahead and decided to implement.
After setting this up, I realized I am not exactly sure how significant this is for actual authentication. The tutorial used Here lists a public hash on the client which is never used in the server side code. It just hashes the content and privateHash values together and compares them on the server. As this is all being passed through the headers, I am wondering how secure this actually is? What is the publicHash value for as it does not even seem to be used?
Client:
<?php

$publicHash = '3441df0babc2a2dda551d7cd39fb235bc4e09cd1e4556bf261bb49188f548348';

$content = json_encode( array( 'test' => 'content' ) );

$hash = hash_hmac('sha256', $content, $privateHash);

$headers = array(
    'X-Public: '.$publicHash,
    'X-Hash: '.$hash
);

$ch = curl_init('http://domain.com/api2/core/device/auth');
curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER,$headers);
curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER,true);
curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS,$content);

$result = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo ""RESULT\n======\n"".print_r($result, true).""\n\n"";

    $app = \Slim\Slim::getInstance();

    $request = $app->request();

    $hash = hash_hmac('sha256', $content, $privateHash);

    if ($hash == $combinedHash)

    }
    else
    {
        $data = array('status' => ""failed"");
        response($data);
    }
}

","I think the article you posted uses the term hash in confusing way. In the article $publicHash is an username and $privateHash is secret key used to sign the payload. 
In other words, like the article says the value of X-Public header is supposed to be used for querying the user specific secret key from database. This secret key is then used to to create an hash from the payload. This hash is then compared to value of X-Hash header.
If the values match then you can be sure the payload has not been tampered and/or the sender of the payload knows the secret key.
This approach is not stateless. It requires you to hit database for each request to find out the secret key for current user. It is also bit problematic if your client is untrusted (ie. JavaScript enabled browser). Works well for machine to machine communication though.
Alternative
You might want to check article called Using JSON Web Tokens as API Keys. JSON Web Tokens provide stateless solution. They are also tamper proof because tokens are signed / hashed with HMAC.

"30126720","RESTful way to upload file along with some data in django","I am creating a webservice with django using django rest framework. 
Users are able to upload some images and videos. Uploading media is a two step action, first user uploads the file and receives an ID then in a separate request uses that ID to refer to the media (for example (s)he can use it as profile picture or use it in a chat message). 
I need to know who is uploading the media for both HMAC authentication middleware and setting owner of media in database. All other requests are in JSON format and include a username field that it used by HMAC middleware to retrieve the secret shared key.
It first came to my mind that media upload api may look like this:
{
  ""username"":""mjafar"",
  ""datetime"":""2015-05-08 19:05"",
  ""media_type"":""photo"",
  ""media_data"": /* base64 encoded image file */
}

But i thought that base64 encoding may have significant overhead for larger files like videos; or there may be some restrictions on size of data that can be parsed in json or be created in user side. (This webservice is supposed to communicate with a Android/iOS app, they have limited memory)! Is this a good solution? Are my concerns real problems or i shouldn't worry? Better solutions?
","You could separate the two. Meta data at one interface with a URL pointing to the actual file.  Depending on how you store the actual file you could then reference the file directly via URL at a later point.
You could then have the POST API directly accept the file and simply return the JSON meta data
{
  ""username"":""mjafar"", // inferred from self.request.user
  ""datetime"":""2015-05-08 19:05"", // timestamp on server
  ""media_type"":""photo"", // inferred from header content-type?
  // auto-generated hashed location for file
  ""url"": ""/files/1dde/2ecf/4075/f61b/5a9c/1cec/53e0/ca9b/4b58/c153/09da/f4c1/9e09/4126/271f/fb4e/foo.jpg""

standard way of generating HMAC using openssl on shell,
echo -n ""data"" | opnessl dgst -sha256 -hmac ""KEY1""

However I can execute following as well,
echo -n ""data"" | opnessl dgst -sha256 -hmac

and both commands run successfully with different output.
I assume the non-existence of key can be perceived by openssl as '\0' (null) key.
Actually my problem is I am unable to generate similar results using javax.crypto.Mac and providing SecretKey with byte[0] = 0; (single byte key having 0 as value).
","EDIT: According to Rich Salz on the OpenSSSL mailing list, the key is not optional with the -hmac option. Expect the behavior of the openssl dgst command to change in the future.
The change will probably occur with OpenSSL 1.0.2 or 1.1.0. It may be back ported to lesser version like 1.0.1, but there are no guarantees.


Actually my problem is I am unable to generate similar results using javax.crypto.Mac and providing SecretKey with byte[0] = 0;

Just use a SHA-256 hash, and not an HMAC. If this is TLDR; then jump to the end ;)
The source file of interest is <openssl src>/apps/dgst.c. Line 225 is where the key is (or should be) set, but its not because there's no following argument:
else if (!strcmp(*argv,""-hmac""))
{
    if (--argc < 1)
        break;
    hmac_key=*++argv;
}



What key is used by openssl (command) for HMAC if key is not passed in as argument

To answer this question, we need to look at the source in <openssl src>/apps/dgst.c.
The -hamc switch populates variable hmac_key, but its NULL so its skipped. The other variable of interest is sigkey, buts its also NULL so its skipped, too.
Line 513 or so is where things get interesting. Nearly everything else is skipped in dgst.c (from under lldb):
   513      if (argc == 0)
   514      {
-> 515          BIO_set_fp(in,stdin,BIO_NOCLOSE);
   516          err=do_fp(out, buf,inp,separator, out_bin, sigkey, sigbuf,
   517                    siglen,NULL,NULL,""stdin"",bmd);
   518      }
(lldb) p sigkey
(EVP_PKEY *) $25 = 0x0000000000000000

So all we need to do is look at do_fp, and its shown below. The line of interest is 627, where this is executed:
len=BIO_gets(bp,(char *)buf,BUFSIZE);

The BIO bp is a chain, and its got your hash chained to it. So whatever you put into it gets hashed. And the hash is not keyed because hmac_key and sigkey were NULL.
At line 654, this is encountered:
BIO_printf(out, ""(%s)= "", file);

If you want to step it yourself, then download and unpack the OpenSSL sources. Then, configure with a debug build:
cd openssl-1.0.1h
./Configure debug-darwin64-x86_64-cc no-ssl2 enable-ec_nistp_64_gcc_128
make depend && make

Open it up under a debugger:
cd openssl-1.0.1h
lldb apps/openssl

And finally run it:
(lldb) b dgst.c:513
(lldb) r dgst -sha256 -hmac

The debugger should snap near do_fp:
Process 27371 stopped

   516          err=do_fp(out, buf,inp,separator, out_bin, sigkey, sigbuf,
(lldb) 

The trick is: when you enter do_fp, the program will start reading from stdin. Enter your string (i.e., data) and then do a CTRL+D to EOF it.

Now, after all of that, here's the short answer :)
$ echo -n ""data"" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac

","The Digest::HMAC only includes Digest::HMAC_MD5 and Digest::HMAC_SHA1. However, I took a look at the Perl code for Digest::HMAC_MD5. The whole thing is about 20 lines of code. It basically creates two methods:
sub hmac_md5 {
    hmac($_[0], $_[1], \&md5, 64);
}

and
sub hmac_md5_hex {
    unpack(""H*"", &hmac_md5);
}

That's pretty much the entire program.
If you forget about the object oriented style of the package, and use the functional style, it looks like this might work for you:
hmac($data, $key, \&ripemd160, 160);

or maybe just:
hmac($data, $key \&ripemd160);

","The reason your code doesn't work is that, while the interface provided by Crypt::RIPEMD160 looks similar to the standard Digest interface, it's not quite compatible: in particular, the reset() method of Crypt::RIPEMD160 apparently doesn't return a reference to the object it's called on, and the code in Digest::HMAC happens to rely on that detail.
This incompatibility would be a trivial things to fix by slightly tweaking either module, either to add the missing return value to Crypt::RIPEMD5 or to make Digest::HMAC less reliant on needless method chaining.  The latter would be as easy as changing the line:
$self->{hasher}->reset->add($self->{k_opad}, $inner_digest);

in Digest::HMAC to:
$self->{hasher}->reset;
$self->{hasher}->add($self->{k_opad}, $inner_digest);

(Of course, I'm not suggesting that you do this yourself, although you could report the issue to the maintainers of those modules.)
However, with both modules as they currently are, it just won't work.  The solutions I'd recommend would be to either use the non-OO interface, as David W. suggests, or try the newer Crypt::Digest::RIPEMD160 module, which properly implements the Digest interface and should play nicer with Digest::HMAC.

Edit:
Actually, David W.'s suggestion won't work as given, because Crypt::RIPEMD160 doesn't export a non-OO ripemd160() function.  You could, however, easily create one:
use Crypt::RIPEMD160;
sub ripemd160 {
    return Crypt::RIPEMD160->hash( join """", @_ );
}

and then use it like this:
use Digest::HMAC qw( hmac );
sub hmac_ripemd160 {
    return hmac( @_[0, 1], \&ripemd160, 64 );
}

(Yes, 64 bytes is the correct block size from HMAC-RIPEMD160, since the input block length of RIPEMD160 is 16 32-bit words, which equals 512 bits or 64 bytes.  In practice, using the wrong input block size is very unlikely to cause any issues, other than for interoperability of course, but the security proof of the HMAC construction assumes, for simplicity, that the key is padded to be exactly one input block long.  Thus, and in order to ensure that all implementations of HMAC-RIPEMD160 produce the same output for the same key and message, it's best to stick to this rule.)

Edit 2: OK, I tried to test the code I posted above against the HMAC-RIPEMD160 test vectors from RFC 2286, and just could not get the results to match.  What I finally realized was two things:

The non-OO hmac() function exported by Digest::HMAC assumes that the custom hash function passed to it will accept multiple parameters and concatenate them.  My original implementation of the ripemd160() wrapper above did not (but I fixed it so that now it does).  This is arguably a bug in Digest::HMAC, or at least in its documentation.
The Crypt::RIPEMD160 module comes with the submodule Crypt::RIPEMD160::MAC, which already implements HMAC-RIPEMD160, even though, for some perverse reason, the documentation doesn't actually use the name HMAC.  If you look at the code, though, or just compare the output to the official test vectors, that's indeed exactly what it does.

"39290443","AES + HMAC Encryption in .Net","I'm trying to serialise and encrypt simple dto's as a means to securely hand them around as strings.
It seems that most people point me at Encrypt and decrypt a string when asking about this.
@jbtule took the time to provide a really detailed answer with 2 possible solutions.
I have taken a copy of the second example from his gist https://gist.github.com/jbtule/4336842#file-aesthenhmac-cs (the file named ""AESThenHMAC.cs"" and put that in to my project.
I then thought it might be good practice to wrap up and quickly test this solution but I can't seem to get it working. 
Could someone explain what I am doing wrong here?
Here's my wrapper round @jbtule's code:
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using System.Text;

namespace Core.Data
{
    public class AesCrypto<T> : ICrypto<T>
    {
        public string Encrypt(T source, string salt)
        {
            var enc = Encoding.Unicode;
            var rawData = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(source);
            return enc.GetString(AESThenHMAC.SimpleEncryptWithPassword(enc.GetBytes(rawData), salt));
        }

        public T Decrypt(string source, string salt)
        {
            var enc = Encoding.Unicode;
            var decryptedBytes = AESThenHMAC.SimpleDecryptWithPassword(enc.GetBytes(source), salt);
            return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>(enc.GetString(decryptedBytes));
        }
    }
}

And then a simple unit test to confirm this all works:
public void TestAesCrypto()
{
    var testInput = new EncryptableObject { Id = 123, Name = ""Victim"", When = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow };
    var crypto = new AesCrypto<EncryptableObject>();

    var saltBytes = new byte[32];
    new Random().NextBytes(saltBytes);
    var testSalt = Encoding.Unicode.GetString(saltBytes);

    var magicString = crypto.Encrypt(testInput, testSalt);
    var testOutput = crypto.Decrypt(magicString, testSalt);

    Assert.AreEqual(testInput.Id, testOutput.Id);
    Assert.AreEqual(testInput.Name, testOutput.Name);
    Assert.AreEqual(testInput.When, testOutput.When);
}

For some reason the decryption method returns null because the check performed on line 261 of jbtule's gist compares the value 255 to 0.
This is a follow on from my attempts to talk to the .NET types directly (see AesEncryption doesn't appear to decrypt right?), I just need a solution that consistently works at this point.

"6986457","IIS dumps Authorization header on redirect after WCF service call without trailing slash","I'm putting together a WCF REST service running in an IIS 7 website instance, and I'm using an HMAC authentication scheme which inserts a token and the HMAC into the Authentication header. An example header list on a typical request might look like this:
GET http://api.mydomain.com/Contacts HTTP/1.1
Authorization: 774F035C-FRTB-4207-DDDD-31BF1534AD96:9h0Whke9Bgi3XSHPo/YSXw==
Content-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8
Host: api.mydomain.com
Connection: Keep-Alive

I have the service set up using routing instead of a .svc file, so my Global.asax looks like this:
    protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        RouteTable.Routes.Add(new ServiceRoute(""Users"", new WebServiceHostFactory(), typeof(UsersService)));
        RouteTable.Routes.Add(new ServiceRoute(""Widgets"", new WebServiceHostFactory(), typeof(WidgetsService)));
    }

The problem is that when the service is declared with routing like that, if IIS receives a call to a WebGet uri without a trailing slash, it does a 307 redirect to the uri with a trailing slash. Helpful, you'd think, but the problem is that the redirect dumps the Authorization header.
My service classes are all kosher and work great in every other respect. Is there a way for me to be able to have that Authorization header be maintained in the event of a redirect? I suspect the solution is going to be an IIS configuration thing, though I guess I could put all kinds of routing hacks in place to pick up the no-slash version of the uri.
Update:
I found this article that verifies this behavior, but doesn't really give any fix.
","So I'm not entirely sure why IIS is getting in the middle of things here. When you say ""dumps the Authorization header"" what do you mean? You mean it's re-sending it as part of the redirect or it's not sending it?
WCF wise you can probably keep the redirect from happening. This is one of those things where you'll want to slap someone at Microsoft for almost getting it right. The UriTemplate class itself has the ability to ignore trailing slashes via the aptly named IgnoreTrailingSlash property. Unfortunately, the WCF WebInvoke/Get attributes don't actually map this property through in any way and therefore always create templates that are bound exactly to whatever you type into the UriTemplate property.
So the simplest workaround, which is nasty I admit, is to overload the method on the WCF contract with a second signature that has the trailing slash. For example:
[OperationContract]
[WebGet(UriTemplate=""/Users"")]
public List<User> GetUsers()
{
   .... some code here ...
}

[OperationContract]
[WebGet(UriTemplate=""/Users/"")]
public List<User> GetUsersSlash()
{
   return this.GetUsers();
}

Fugly, right? Especially bad if this is a pattern you want to repeat over and over. So another semi-but-less-hacky option is to write custom operation selector logic which you apply to your service via a custom behavior. There's more details on doing this in this StackOverflow answer.

Python:

I have added a code in ruby as follows. But does not yield the same response as in python
Ruby:

The following is working for me:
   digest = OpenSSL::Digest.new('sha512')

    sign = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(digest, PRIVATE_KEY, post_data)

","FYI digest/hmac shouldn't be used. From the Ruby docs

CAUTION: Use of this library is discouraged, because this implementation was meant to be experimental but somehow got into the 1.9 series without being noticed.

The docs suggest using openssl, but I had better luck with ruby-hmac.  Also, is SHA512 absolutely necessary for you? Here is a solution that works using SHA1.
Python:
import hmac
import hashlib
response = hmac.new(""PRIVATE_KEY"", ""Stack OverFlow Funtime"", hashlib.sha1).hexdigest()

gives 203bf02ea1c71df39a1a6b8ad00db836ec89113c
Ruby:
require 'rubygems'
require 'hmac-sha1'

key = 'PRIVATE_KEY'
signature = ""Stack OverFlow Funtime""
hmac = HMAC::SHA1.new(key)
hmac.update(signature)
puts ""#{hmac.hexdigest}\n""

gives 203bf02ea1c71df39a1a6b8ad00db836ec89113c
So using SHA1 and ruby-hmac you can get the same hash in both languages. Hope that helps.

But what other solutions are there? What if my data is so large that I need to stream it? I can check the HMAC at the very end, but I cannot afford loading the whole file twice and check the HMAC first and then stream and decrypt it to the user?
Are there different ways?
Can an attacker also do padding oracle attacks if I use AES_CBC(zlib(data))? zlib will emit errors if the compressed data is garbled eventually. Can an attacker use that error of zlib to get one bit of information, too?

"38623335","AES-Encrypt-then-MAC a large file with .NET","I want to encrypt a large file (lets say 64 GB) in the most efficient way in .NET.
How I would implement this:

Create an instance of AesManaged to encrypt the stream of the file (read 64 GB)
Save this stream to disk (because it is to big to hold in memory) (write 64 GB)
Create an instance of HMACSHA512 to compute hash of the saved file (read 64 GB)
Save encrypted data with iv to disk (read & write 64 GB)

Simplified C# Code:
using (var aesManaged = new AesManaged())
{
    using (var msEncrypt = File.OpenWrite(@""C:\Temp\bigfile.bin.tmp""))
    {
        using (var csEncrypt = new CryptoStream(msEncrypt, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write))
        {
            File.OpenRead(@""C:\Temp\bigfile.bin"").CopyTo(csEncrypt);
            new MemoryStream(iv).CopyTo(csEncrypt);
        }
    }
}

using (var hmac = new HMACSHA512(hmacKey))
{
    hmacHash = hmac.ComputeHash(File.OpenRead(@""C:\Temp\bigfile.bin.tmp""));
}

byte[] headerBytes;
using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())
{
    var header = new Header
    {
        IV = iv,
        HmacHash = hmacHash
    };
    Serializer.Serialize(memoryStream, header);
    headerBytes = memoryStream.ToArray();
}

using (var newfile = File.OpenWrite(@""C:\Temp\bigfile.bin.enc""))
{
    new MemoryStream(MagicBytes).CopyTo(newfile);
    new MemoryStream(BitConverter.GetBytes(headerBytes.Length)).CopyTo(newfile);
    new MemoryStream(headerBytes).CopyTo(newfile);
    File.OpenRead(@""C:\Temp\bigfile.bin.tmp"").CopyTo(newfile);
}

This implementation has the disadvantage that I created a second file and that I read multiple times 64 GB from disk.
Is the necessary? How to minimize disk IO and ram allocation? 
","I always get CryptoStreams wrong, so please excuse my pseudocode. The basic idea is to ""chain"" streams, so that plaintext gets copied to a cryptostream which does the encryption, which in turn writes data to a cryptostream that does the MACing, which then writes to plain old file stream:
using(var encryptedFileStream = File.OpenWrite(""...""))        
using(var macCryptoStream = new CryptoStream(encryptedFileStream, mac, CryptoStreamMode.Write))
using(var encryptCryptoStream = new CryptoStream(macCryptoStream, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write))
using(var inputFileStream = File.OpenRead(""...""))
    inputFileStream.CopyTo(encryptCryptoStream);

This way, you only need a single pass through your 64 Gb.
Now, you'll have to somehow store the IV and MAC in the beginning of your encrypted file, so first ""resize"" it:
using(var encryptedFileStream = File.OpenWrite(""...""))   
{
    var offset = YourMagicHeaderLength + IvLength + MacLength;
    encryptedFileStream.SetLength(offset);
    encryptedFileStream.Position = offset;

    // The rest of the code goes here
}

and then, after encrypting and computing MAC, rewind to the very beginning and write them out.

My question is, Is it possible to have:
BYTE HMAC[] = {0x50,0x61,0x73,0x73,0x77,0x6F,0x72,0x64};
BYTE data2[] = {0x4D,0x65,0x73,0x73,0x61,0x67,0x65};

And still get the same value: AFF791FA574D564C83F6456CC198CBD316949DC9.
For example, if I was on a server and received the packet:
[HEADER] 08 50 61 73 73 77 6F 72 64 00
[HEADER] 07 4D 65 73 73 61 67 65 00

And I rip 50 61 73 73 77 6F 72 64 & 4D 65 73 73 61 67 65 from the packet and used this for my HMACSHA1.  How would I go about doing that to get the correct HMACSHA1 value?
    BYTE HMAC[] = ""Password"";
    BYTE data2[] = ""Message"";
    //BYTE HMAC[] = {0x50,0x61,0x73,0x73,0x77,0x6F,0x72,0x64};
    //BYTE data2[] = {0x4D,0x65,0x73,0x73,0x61,0x67,0x65};
    HMAC_CTX ctx;
    result = (unsigned char*) malloc(sizeof(char) * result_len);
    ENGINE_load_builtin_engines();
    ENGINE_register_all_complete();
    HMAC_CTX_init(&ctx);
    HMAC_Init_ex(&ctx, HMAC, strlen((const char*)HMAC), EVP_sha1(), NULL);
    HMAC_Update(&ctx, data2, strlen((const char*)(data2)));
    HMAC_Final(&ctx, result, &result_len);
    HMAC_CTX_cleanup(&ctx);

    std::cout << ""\n\n"";


 for(int i=0;i<result_len;i++)
    std::cout << setfill('0') << setw(2) << hex << (int)result[i];

    int asd;
    std::cin >> asd;
// AFF791FA574D564C83F6456CC198CBD316949DC9

EDIT:
It works by doing this:
BYTE HMAC[] = {0x50,0x61,0x73,0x73,0x77,0x6F,0x72,0x64, 0x00};
BYTE data2[] = {0x4D,0x65,0x73,0x73,0x61,0x67,0x65, 0x00};

By adding 0x00, at the end.  But, my question is more towards ripping it from data, and using it... would it still be fine?
","The issue is the relation ship between arrays, strings, and the null char.
When you declare ""Password"", the compiler logically treats the string literal as a nine byte array, {0x50,0x61,0x73,0x73,0x77,0x6F,0x72,0x64, 0x00}.  When you call strlen, it will count the number of bytes until it encounters the first 0x00.  strlen(""Password"") will return 8 even though there are technically nine characters in the array of characters.
So when you declare an array of 8 bytes as follows without a trailing null byte:
BYTE HMAC[] = {0x50,0x61,0x73,0x73,0x77,0x6F,0x72,0x64};

The problem is that ""strlen(HMAC)"" will count at least 8 bytes, and keep counting while traversing undefined memory until it finally (if ever) hits a byte that is zero.  At best, you might get lucky because the stack memory always has a zero byte padding your array declaration.  More likely it will return a value much larger than 8.  Maybe it will crash.
So when you parse the HMAC and MESSAGE field from your protocol packet, you count the number of bytes actually parsed (not including the terminating null).  And pass that count into the hmac functions to indicate the size of your data.
I don't know your protocol code, but I hope you aren't using strlen to parse the packet to figure out where the string inside the packet ends.  A clever attacker could inject a packet with no null terminator and cause your code do bad things.  I hope you are parsing securely and carefully.  Typical protocol code doesn't include the null terminating byte in the strings packed inside.  Usually the ""length"" is encoded as an integer field followed by the string bytes.  Makes it easier to parse and determine if the length would exceed the packet size read in.

Based on the AWS docs what code does it take to get the signature given in the examples... 
What is the function of successive calls to .write() on a crypto stream? It doesn't append. And, it doesn't wrap in a new HMAC-SHA256.

Not sure if you need the setEncoding() call at that point. Just let it process, and call:

as the return output from hmac.read() is of type Buffer, so the toString() works fine on it.

  h4.end();
console.log( h4.read() )

And, if so.. Why do I get back,

d949da6fe2897897d73557446db35c06dc34feb7f74e7d949c6fe9d674a02103

And, not that which is given in the docs:

aeeed9bbccd4d02ee5c0109b86d86835f995330da4c265957d157751f604d404

I've also tried to write this a different way too, because I'm not sure how subsequent calls to .write() are handled
var h1 = crypto.createHmac( 'sha256', ""AWS4"" + 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY' );
  h1.setEncoding('hex');
  h1.write( '20130524' );
  h1.write( 'us-east-1' );
  h1.write( 's3' );
  h1.write('aws4_request');
  h1.end();
  console.log( h1.read() );

So I guess I have two questions

Based on the AWS docs what code does it take to get the signature given in the examples... 
What is the function of successive calls to .write() on a crypto stream? It doesn't append. And, it doesn't wrap in a new HMAC-SHA256.

","I just spent 16 hours trying to figure this out and I got a working solution, based on your initial steps. Not the most elegant code but it works! See below.

","So answering my own question,
Turns out the problem doesn't lie within my SendQuery method, but a function that calls it uses Double.ToString(""F8"") to produce a parameter value, which results in varying decimal separator character depending on the local formatting.
For example:
double val = 1000.5;

string str = val.ToString(""F8"");

Depending on the formatting will produces either
""1000.50000000"" or 
""1000,50000000"".
So you have to provide the IFormatProvider argument when using the Double.ToString method,
or just use a dirty-but-works-like-a-charm trick like:
ToString(""F8"").Replace("","", ""."");

"21279618","When is an ELF .text segment not an ELF .text segment?","I'm having trouble finding appropriate documentation for the problem I'm having generating consistent HMACS in the kernel and user space. According to R. Love in LKD, the Memory Descriptor mm->start_code and mm->end_code are supposed to contain the .text segment. Finding the .text segment in a static executable is well defined in the ELF documentation and is easy to get at. So,given the following two code snippets, one would expect to get a matching HMAC:
Kernel:
__mm = get_task_mm(__task);

__retcode = ntru_crypto_hmac_init(__crypto_context);
if(__retcode != NTRU_CRYPTO_HMAC_OK)
    return 1;

__retcode = ntru_crypto_hmac_update(__crypto_context, (const uint8_t*)__mm->start_code, 
                                    __mm->end_code - __mm->start_code);
if(__retcode != NTRU_CRYPTO_HMAC_OK)
   return 1;

__retcode = ntru_crypto_hmac_final(__crypto_context, __hmac);
if(__retcode != NTRU_CRYPTO_HMAC_OK)
    return 1;

return 0;

Userland:
for (j = 0; j < file_hdr32.e_shnum; j++)
{
   if (!strcmp("".text"", strIndex + section_hdr32[j]->sh_name))
   {
       retcode = ntru_crypto_hmac_init(__crypto_context());
       if(retcode != NTRU_CRYPTO_HMAC_OK)
       {
            syslog(LOG_ERR, ""ntru_crypto_hmac_init error: retcode = %d, TID(0x%lx)"",
                                     retcode,pthread_self());
            return 0;
        }       

       retcode = ntru_crypto_hmac_update(__crypto_context(), 
                 filebuf + section_hdr32[j]->sh_offset, section_hdr32[j]->sh_size);
       if(retcode != NTRU_CRYPTO_HMAC_OK)
       {
           syslog(LOG_ERR, ""Internal crypto error (%d)"", retcode);
           return 0;
       }

       retcode = ntru_crypto_hmac_final(__crypto_context(), _hmac);
       if(retcode != NTRU_CRYPTO_HMAC_OK)
       {

           return 0;
       }

       return 1;
   }
}

In both cases the .text segment is exactly where its documented to be but they never match. I've generated userland HMACS for all 17,000 executable files on the system so even if the code segment in the kernel memory descriptor were pointing to a dependency, rather than the primary executable, I still should get a match, but no dice. There's something fundamentally different between the two "".text"" segments and I was wondering if anyone out there knew what it was so I can save some time--any clues?   Thanks in advance, pete.;1
","
There's something fundamentally different between the two "".text"" segments

Your problem is that you are ignoring the difference between segments and sections.
The ELF format is an executable and linking format. Segments are used for the former, sections for the latter (and linking here means static linking, i.e. build-time). Once the binary is linked, sections can be completely discarded from it, and only segments are needed at runtime. Segments are mmaped, not sections.
Now let's look at the difference between the two.

Above you can see that multiple sections (.interp, .note.ABI-tag, ... .text, ...) all got mapped into a single PT_LOAD segment. All these sections have the same protections, and all are ""covered"" by a single [mm->start_core, mm->end_code) region.
Compare this to the .text section:
readelf -WS /bin/date | grep '\.text'
  [13] .text             PROGBITS        0000000000401900 001900 0077f8 00  AX  0   0 16

You'll note that the section is smaller and begins at a different offset.
No wonder you get different HMAC then. Try computing HMAC in user-land over segments, and you should get a match.

","You only need to include the request parameters when creating the list of key-value pairs - don't need ""protocol=https://"".
https://help.shopify.com/api/getting-started/authentication/oauth#verification
You'll need to urldecode() the result of http_build_query(). It returns a url-encoded query string.
http://php.net/manual/en/function.http-build-query.php
Instead of:
 echo $http = ""protocol="". urldecode(""https://"").http_build_query( $params) ;
 echo $test = hash_hmac(""sha256"", $http , $secret);

"26538670","How do I truncate HmacSHA256 to 128 bits?","Java supports three MAC algorithms:

HmacMD5
HmacSHA1
HmacSHA256

I however need to sign someting using HMAC-SHA256-128, which is HmacSHA256 but truncated to 128 bits.
This example and variants of has circulated on stackoverflow:
String MAC = hmacHelper.calculatePlainMAC(""00000000"", ""HmacSHA256"");

String bgSecretKey=""1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF"";

public String calculatePlainMAC(String ascii, String algorithm)
{
  Mac mac = null;
  final Charset asciiCs = Charset.forName(""US-ASCII"");
  try
  {
    SecretKeySpec signingKey = new SecretKeySpec(bgcSecretKey.getBytes(), algorithm);
    mac = Mac.getInstance(algorithm);
    mac.init(signingKey);
    byte[] rawHmac = mac.doFinal(asciiCs.encode(ascii).array());

    String result = """";
    for (final byte element : rawHmac)
    {
      result += Integer.toString((element & 0xff) + 0x100, 16);//.substring(1);
    }
    log.debug(""Result: "" + result);
    return result;
  }
  catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e)
  {
    e.printStackTrace();
    return null;
  }
  catch (InvalidKeyException e)
  {
    e.printStackTrace();
    return null;
  }
}

Result:
1051cd18118219e1261f41401891fd1911a91cf1bc1751db13e10617c1221131231c31ab15613f14412c1681d7132178

This is all good, except that I need a 128-bit result, which I know is
FF365893D899291C3BF505FB3175E880

I have no idea how they reached this result. What I do know is that the HMAC algorithm used is HmacSHA256-128. From what I understand this algorithm will generate a 256-bit result, question is, how do I truncate this into a 128-bits result, returning the known result above?
","The following line always adds 3 characters to the string, starting with '1'. The commented substring(1) removes the 1. It is used so that single character results get a zero pre-pended.
result += Integer.toString((element & 0xff) + 0x100, 16);//.substring(1);

However, even when you fix this, the result does not contain the truncated result you are expecting.
05cd81829e26f44089fd91a9cfbc75db3e067c221323c3ab563f442c68d73278

This of course depends on the value of bgcSecretKey.
You need to use the same key/algorithm/truncation you used to derive the expected result.

import hashlib

def HmacSHA256(k,v):
    message = bytes(k).encode('utf-8')
    secret = bytes(v).encode('utf-8')
    signature = hmac.new(secret, message, digestmod=hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()

print signature

How to get the second result in Python,Thanks!
","To get the desired clientKey2 you need to encode the hex digits of your saltedPassword string to bytes. One way to do that which works on both Python 2 & Python 3 is to use binascii.unhexlify.
Your HmacSHA256 function is a bit odd. It won't work on Python 3, since bytes objects don't have an .encode method. In Python 2, bytes is just a synonym for str.
Anyway, here's some code that works on both Python 2 & Python 3.
from __future__ import print_function
import hashlib
import hmac
import binascii

key = ""Client Key"".encode()
salted = ""6e441ccd26e6b35198b4b17457dc0266d36b751d0062b5850b0e302ceb1d6dcc""
raw = binascii.unhexlify(salted)

signature = hmac.new(key, salted.encode(), digestmod=hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
print(signature)

signature = hmac.new(key, raw, digestmod=hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
print(signature)

output
857ef8988876a3bb6bcadb85ca257787074e73e830d7dc14c1f838ba46aef1f5
9a8574da9b276ee1162dcb92071df587f4513bc03060bda1e9b3897d46233416

The output is identical on Python 2 & Python 3.
BTW, it would be simpler to do this task in Python 3, which makes a clean distinction between text and byte strings. Also, the Python 3 hashlib module has a pbkdf2 function.

Difference is in PHP $str initialized with base64_encode but in JAVA you didn't encode during hash_mac

All you need to encode in base64 the str in JAVA before hash_mac
private String hash_hmac(String str, String secret) {
        String ss = Base64.encodeToString(str.getBytes(""UTF-8""));
        Mac sha256_HMAC = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA256"");
        SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(secret.getBytes(""UTF-8""), ""HmacSHA256"");
        sha256_HMAC.init(secretKey);
        String hash1 = Base64.encodeToString(sha256_HMAC.doFinal(ss.getBytes(""UTF-8"")));
        return hash1;
}


Or just change in PHP code to remove base64 in str initialization

","I solved this! The small parameter: Base64.NO_WRAP when i encode base64 byte to base64 to hmac.
Tha Android Java code is:
private String hash_hmac_test(String base_string, String key) throws Exception {

    try {
        Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA256"");
        SecretKeySpec secret = new SecretKeySpec(key.getBytes(""UTF-8""), mac.getAlgorithm());
        mac.init(secret);

        String base_string_base64 = Base64.encodeToString(base_string.getBytes(), Base64.NO_WRAP);

        byte[] digest = mac.doFinal(base_string_base64.getBytes());
        //android.util.Base64.encodeT
        String retVal = Base64.encodeToString(digest,Base64.DEFAULT);

        Log.v(TAG, ""String: "" + base_string);


        Log.v(TAG, ""String in Base64: "" + base_string_base64);

        Log.v(TAG, ""key: "" + key);
        Log.v(TAG, ""result: "" + retVal);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println(e.getMessage());
    }

    return ""ok"";
}

And in PHP code is:
base64_encode(hash_hmac('sha256', base64_encode($str), $key,true))

Both result works fine!
Thank you for all!

"35314629","How to sign data in PHP with HMAC using a PEM private key","I have seen a lot of posts about how to create a HMAC in PHP, but the used secret was always a simple string (eg. ""secret""). What I need to do is create a HMAC with the secret being a private key, loaded for example from a file containing private key in PEM format. I have been unable to find any information on whether this is possible in PHP (using hash_hmac) or not.
Usage
A HmacSHA256 signature using a private key is created in Java and I would like to recreate this signature in PHP (from my understanding using hash_hmac with sha256 hashing algorithm) with the same private key loaded from a file.
To clarify: 
the private key in this scenario is used as a shared secret key, meaning that two parties have the key. The message verification process consists of sending a HMAC with the message, calculated with the private key, while the recipient calculates HMAC with an identical private key and verifies it against the sent signature. 
Code
Java:
byte[] data = getDataForSignature();
PrivateKey key = getPrivateKey(); // loaded from a file
Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA256"");
mac.init(key);
byte[] hmac = mac.doFinal(data);
// compare hmac with received signature bytes

PHP:
$key = openssl_pkey_get_private(""private.key"");
$sig = hash_hmac(""sha256"", $data, $key??, true);

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

","Usually a private key is used to perform signature generation which is the asymmetric equivalent to creating a MAC with a symmetric secret key.
Note that a HMAC key can consist of any binary string, so in principle it would be possible to use HMAC with a binary encoded private key. That said, it doesn't make sense to use a asymmetric private key for HMAC. Only the person holding the private key would be able to verify the resulting authentication tag. In comparison, digital signatures can be verified using the public key of the key pair.

Now if you have a secret key that was used within Java then you need to create the same (binary) key parameter for the PHP hash_hmac function.

"1625607","Best way to generate a hash signature (HMAC) for XMLSerialized objects in .NET?","I need to generate a HMAC for objects that I am serializing using the XMLSerializer found in the .NET framework. Each object will contain a property called ""HMAC"" that will contain a hash of the object's values itself but excluding the ""HMAC"" field. I've found this question that mentions a built-in solution within the CLR but doesn't elaborate on exactly what its called or how I go about using it?
A sample object would look something like this:
[Serializable]
[XmlRoot(""request"", IsNullable = false)]
public class Request
{

    [XmlElement(ElementName = ""hmac"")]
    public string Hmac { get; set; } 

    [XmlElement(ElementName = ""nonce"")]
    public string Nonce { get; set; }

    [XmlElement(ElementName = ""expiration"")]
    public DateTime Expiration { get; set; }

    /* A bunch of other properties to be serialized */

    private Request() { }

    public Request(string hmac, string nonce, DateTime expiration)
    {
        Hmac = hmac;
        Nonce = nonce;
        Expiration = expiration;
    }
}

The HMAC property will need to be set as a serialization of the entire object, excluding the HMAC object itself. My first thoughts are setting up some sort of two-pass serialization, which involves:

Setting an xmlignore property to the HMAC object on the first pass
Serializing the entire object
Hashing the result, and setting the value of the HMAC property
Re-serializing the whole thing again, ready for transmission.

Is this the best way to go about it? Has anyone done anything like this before, and what have you found to be the cleanest way of going about it???
","I think you will have to serialize it twice to get the exact effect you described. One way to make that easier would be to not use XmlIgnore but instead add a public specified property (which .NET XML serialization treats specially to programmatically control whether to emit the similarly named property):
 [XmlIgnore]
 public bool HmacSpecified
 {
     get { return !String.IsNullOrEmpty(this.Hmac); }
     set { }
 }

What this will do is only emit the hmac XML node if one exists. A similar effect could be achieved with the DefaultValueAttribute but I've found some inconsistencies with it (e.g. null is sometimes replaced with """" during compilation). Plus if your logic was more complex than a single contant sentinel value you could handle that in the property but not in a static attribute.
get { return !this.IsCalculatingHmac(); }

This would be the way I would do it if the format had to exactly match what you've described.

If you have flexibility in the output format, another approach you might consider is having a message container which contains the message body (your current XML doc) and an HMAC Signature value. This way you would only need to serialize the document once.
Even if the envelope were part of a larger serialization document you could implement an IXmlSerializable.WriteXml interface on the envelope. This would allow you to carefully serialize the message to a string, then perform the hash, then write out the HMAC and message elements all in one via XmlWriter.WriteRaw.
This would be the way I would do it if performance was important.

"8523124","Does a Message authentication code (MAC) ensure authenticity of the key used?","I have to protects confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of a file of records with a password. The number of records can potentially be more then 32^2 and each record can be accessed independently.
One way to implement it is

Generate a 256-bit random salt and store it in the file header.
Generate a derived key from the password and the salt using PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA256 from PKCS #5.
For each record generate a 96-bit random initialization vector.
Encrypt each record's content using AES-256 in GCM mode using the derived key, the initialization vector, and (as additional authenticated data) the position of the record in a file.
As a result, each record will store an initialization vector, an encrypted content, and a MAC.

But the NIST Special Publication SP800-38D defining GCM and GMAC requires the number of records to be less than 32^2 for the initialization vectors to be unique.
So I devised another solution: create a key for each record with HMAC-SHA256 using the derived key as a key and the position of the record in a file as a message to be authenticated (salt).
So the question is do I need to provide the position of the record in a file to the authenticated encryption algorithm
as an additional authenticated data since I've already taken care of it when generating the key?
Additionally do I really need to use initialization vectors at all since all the records will be encrypted and
authenticated using supposedly different keys generated by HMAC-SHA256(PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA256, password, salt, iterationCount, 256), blockAddress) ?
I don't know what the size of the file will be, so I presume it can be very large.
","If I understood you correctly (bit of a disclaimer, sorry) then you should be fine without adding the position within the record in the file.
No you don't need a random IV if you only use a (session) key once. Using an IV consisting of zero's would be enough (deterministic construction, using one device and a counter set to zero, if we keep with the NIST nomenclature).

I'm using the code sample from here https://github.com/synedra/LinkedIn-OAuth-Sample-Client
Edit: Will be trying to get to the bottom of this tomorrow and answer my own question if no one beats me to it.
","After much wrangling with the Linkedin API Beast, I found the issue to be in the way things are encoded, a long story, in OAuthLoginView.m in method 'requestTokenFromProvider' I needed to include the param 'scope' with the relevant permissions in a OARequestParameter object.
(based off the github repo -> https://github.com/synedra/LinkedIn-OAuth-Sample-Client) 
After that, wherever you're making your api call, (in OAuthStarterKit for example) like in ProfileTabView::profileApiCall you can fire off URL posts like this: http://api.linkedin.com/v1/people/~:(id,first-name,last-name,industry)""]; 
or if you need their email address, it appears (as long as you've got permission to access email, you can grab that too as simply as this:
NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@""http://api.linkedin.com/v1/people/~:(id,first-name,last-name,industry,email-address)""];

See the code for using a OARequestParameter in the URL request below...
- (void)requestTokenFromProvider
{
    OAMutableURLRequest *request = 
            [[[OAMutableURLRequest alloc] initWithURL:requestTokenURL
                                             consumer:self.consumer
                                                token:nil   
                                             callback:linkedInCallbackURL
                                    signatureProvider:nil] autorelease];

    [request setHTTPMethod:@""POST""];

    OARequestParameter * scopeParameter=[OARequestParameter requestParameter:@""scope"" value:@""r_fullprofile r_contactinfo r_emailaddress""];

    [request setParameters:[NSArray arrayWithObject:scopeParameter]];

    OADataFetcher *fetcher = [[[OADataFetcher alloc] init] autorelease];
    [fetcher fetchDataWithRequest:request
                         delegate:self

                  didFailSelector:@selector(requestTokenResult:didFail:)];    
}

And for a more in depth short cut to using linkedin's API I'll keep some quicktips on my blog here ->http://techrantnz.blogspot.com.au/2012/09/the-linkedin-api-with-oauthstarterkit.html

Yes, it is shorter. It is 32 times shorter than binary, and 4 times shorter than base-16. However, ripemd160 does not guarantee to give an unique identifier for every link. There are still some collisions (which I don't even know how rare it will be).

I'm currently using the GetBytes() method of RNGCryptoServiceProvider to generate a key, but the byte array it returns contains non-printable characters. So I'm wondering if it is secure to base64 encode the result or does that erode the randomness too much and make things much less secure? If that isn't a good approach can you suggest one?
I do understand that by limiting the keys to printable characters I am limiting the overall breadth of the key space (ie: lopping off 1 of the 8 bits), but I am OK with that.
","If you can handle not auto-generating the key then http://www.grc.com/passwords is a good source of VERY random key material.
Base64 wouldn't reduce the underlying entropy of the byte array.  You could generate the key and use it in its raw form, but Base64 encode it to transport it to where you need it to be.  You'd then Base64 decode it back to the raw form before you use it in the new location.  There is no loss of entropy in this operation.  The Base64 encoding reduces the entropy to 6-bits per byte instead of 8, but the result of the coding is longer, so overall the entropy is the same.
The other way you could do it would be to get 24 random bytes for 192-bits worth of entropy.  Base64 encoding this would give you a 32 character string (256-bits) which still has the original randomness and 192-bits of entropy.  You could use this as your shared key directly.

So I'm wondering if it is secure to base64 encode the result or does that erode the randomness too much and make things much less secure? If that isn't a good approach can you suggest one?
I do understand that by limiting the keys to printable characters I am limiting the overall breadth of the key space (ie: lopping off 1 of the 8 bits), but I am OK with that.
","BASE64 transforms a byte sequence so it uses only certain printable characters.
This transformation does not change the information in any way, just how it is stored. It is also reversible: you can get the original byte sequence by decoding the BASE64 output.
So using BASE64 does not ""erode the randomness"" or limit the key space in any way.

","I'm not a C programmer but...
From my reading of that article USERDOMAIN should be just that - NOT USER+USERDOMAIN ie the uppercase username = ""USER"" concat with the target = ""DOMAIN"" to give USERDOMAIN which gives the unicode bytes beginning 55005300...
Then it would appear your udata array is the wrong size. You're only processing 20 bytes of information so don't set the array to 28 otherwise the HMAC/MD5 functions will be processing extra random data at the end of the input array.

","Some ideas to try:

Check that raw has the same length as file
Open f as binary

strip will remove all whitespace from start and end of a string in Python - I think trim only removes from the end. So you may want rstrip() possibly with explicit characters set to get the same behaviour

","This is the problem with encoding of the data you read from the filesystem and has nothing with algorithms you use.
When you work with string data both in Python and JavaScript, you should be very careful about encoding which your data is stored in. Try to work with data either as with strings (which, in particular have such a property as encoding), or as with ""raw data"". When reading and signing data, you shouldn't probably care about the encoding, and try to use data as ""raw"" as much as you can in your language.
Some points to note:

Filesystem stores ""raw"" bytes, and knows nothing about the contents and the encoding of your file. Furthermore, for some files (like, jpegs, for example), the ""encoding"" concept is worthless
The same is valid for crypto algorithms. They work with raw bytes and know nothing about its ""character representation"". That's why digital signatures work so well with all sorts of binary documents, etc.
trim() in javascript or strip() in python work with strings, and their behaviour can vary depending on the underlying encoding (try u's '.encode('utf-16').strip().decode('utf-16') in python, for example). If possible, I'd rather avoid using trimming, to not to mix the way you work with data.
Python 2.x (and, I suppose, Javascript too) have set of rules for implicit conversion between strings and raw data.  

Here in your code you work with binary data in Python, but do conversion to string in JavaScript, when you define the encoding of the file to read. Apparently, there is a sort of implicit converting from utf-8 back to raw string in crypto module, but I don't know what it does.
As described in here, the most kosher way of handing raw strings in node.js is to use buffers. You could read buffer from filesystem, but unfortunately, nodejs crypto library doesn't support them yet. As described here:

The Crypto module was added to Node before there was the concept of a
  unified Stream API, and before there were Buffer objects for handling
  binary data.
As such, the streaming classes don't have the typical methods found on
  other Node classes, and many methods accept and return Binary-encoded
  strings by default rather than Buffers.

That's said, to make the example work, current approach is to read data by passing ""binary"" as the second argument to the call:
file = fs.readFileSync argv.file, ""binary""

Also, as I said, I'd rather avoid stripping data I just read from the file.

PRF(secret, label, seed) = P_MD5(S1, label + seed) XOR
                          P_SHA-1(S2, label + seed);

for doing this.P_hash in turn has the following formula:
P_hash(secret, seed) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(1) + seed) +

                          HMAC_hash(secret, A(3) + seed) + ...

The RFC also says 

P_hash can be iterated as many times as is necessary to produce the
     required quantity of data. For example, if P_SHA-1 was being used to
     create 64 bytes of data, it would have to be iterated 4 times
     (through A(4)), creating 80 bytes of output data; the last 16 bytes
     of the final iteration would then be discarded, leaving 64 bytes of
     output data.

I find ""P_hash can be iterated as many times as is necessary to produce the required quantity of data"" confusing.Just how many times is necessary?Is there a threshold after which it doesn't matter how much it is? If so, what is this threshold?
","I'm pretty sure that in TLS 1.0, the premaster secret and the master secret are always 48bytes long, but then when you create your key block further down the line, it can be longer than 48 bytes. i.e. if your cipher uses sha1 and aes256, you will need 136 bytes.

","So, while MrFlick did answer my specific question, the real issue was deeper. The whole question was prompted by a disagreement between Perl's hmac_sha256_base64() and R.
It turned out that I was using R incorrectly. hmac() returns hex code, not base64, so an additional step is needed. However, it seems that the base64() function in RCurl requires a vector of bytes, not a concatenated string. I illustrate below.
What I was doing (WRONG):
require(digest)
require(RCurl)

> hmac(""foo"", ""Hello"", algo=""sha256"")
[1] ""fa687477a49ebadb72eb1103db6128061437a2501db7ee7f0cbbb79ceaa2fcfc""

attr(,""class"")
[1] ""base64""

What I should have done (CORRECT):
> hmac(""foo"", ""Hello"", algo=""sha256"", raw = T)
[1] fa 68 74 77 a4 9e ba db 72 eb 11 03 db 61 28 06 14 37 a2 50 1d b7 ee 7f 0c bb b7 9c ea a2 fc fc

Rather different, no?
The latter agrees with the Perl, and (more importantly) it actually authenticates correctly on Amazon Web Services. :-)

"20766988","Inspecting the body of an HTTP request with gocraft Middleware","I've been using the gocraft-web package so far to do some development on an HTTP service. It's really great because you can stick middleware in it to check for stuff like the presence of a Cookie in the header.
At the moment I am wanting to implement request signing. Getting the client to sign the request is easy enough, but I am wanting to check it for all endpoints with a common piece of middleware. Basically the middleware needs to find the key to check against, compute the request HMAC, and check it against the supplied HMAC (presumably in the Authorization Header). 
Computing the actual HMAC is really easy in go.
The problem is: reading the message in middleware makes it unavailable to the final endpoint.
The best solution I have come up with (example shown below) is to read everything from the Request in the middleware and stuffing it back into a bytes.Buffer for later reading. Is there a better way to do this? The current implementation seems a bit hackish.
Reading everything into memory sucks, but I can probably just put my service behind a proxy and limit the size of requests anyways. The actual content will always be pretty small(under 5 kilobytes). The extra copy introduced by this approach is likely to be quite slow, but computing the HMAC of a message is not exactly cheap to begin with.
The advantage to this is that it is transparent: it will work with any other go http code that just expects to read from Request.Body without any magic.
I suppose I could be a bit slicker and use a io.TeeReader.
This is my solution so far. If you post to localhost:3300 some JSON it prints the sha512 to the terminal in the server process, but also the response is able to contain a listing of the keys & values in it.

","From your description, it looks like you need to read all the bytes from the request body, regardless of what your handlers will do.
If so, then you have at least a couple of options that would avoid the extra copy:
1) Store the read contents inside your gocraft context.
2) Do all body data processing and validation in the middleware and store the results of the processing in the context.
Granted, this means that your handlers now must know that they should look for the contents in the context instead of the req.Body.
I think it's a decent trade-off though, given your requirements.

For example:
AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAITPQPJO62G4LAE7Q&Action=ListOrders&MarketplaceId.Id.1=XXXXXXXXXXX&Merchant=XXXXXXXXXXX&OrderStatus.Status.1=PartiallyShipped&OrderStatus.Status.2=Unshipped&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2014-01-29T22%3A11%3A00Z&Version=2011-01-01&Signature=tNufJeONZlscTlHs%2FLAWBs7zwsfpIaQcUK%2B5XIPJpcQ%3D

But the response I keep getting is this:

"14150124","How to get HMAC key in OpenSSL","I am using OpenSSL and I want to extract my HMAC key and AES key from the session, so that I can accelerate HMAC and AES encryption with GPU in application.
Where can I get the keys after SSL_accept?
Is the AES key stored in SSLHandle->enc_write_ctx->cipher_data?
Where is the HMAC key stored?
","If you have the SSL* called ssl, then look at ssl->session for the master key and ssl->s3 for the current hamc key.
ssl.h has a struct ssl_session_st, and that's the ssl->session above. The master key is stored in struct ssl_session_st.
struct ssl_session_st
{
  int ssl_version;   /* what ssl version session info is
                      * being kept in here? */

  /* only really used in SSLv2 */
  unsigned int key_arg_length;
  unsigned char key_arg[SSL_MAX_KEY_ARG_LENGTH];
  int master_key_length;
  unsigned char master_key[SSL_MAX_MASTER_KEY_LENGTH];
  ...
}

Some derivation goes on, and you can see it in, for example, s3_clnt.c. SSL2 uses two session keys - one in each direction (client to server; and server to client). The key is used for both privacy and integrity protection. SSLv3 and above uses 6 keys - three in each direction (client to server; and server to client). One key is used for privacy, the second is used for integrity, and the third is used as a nonce or iv.
To see what the HMAC key is, take a look at, for example, n_ssl3_mac in s3_enc.c around line 700. You will see something like:
int n_ssl3_mac(SSL *ssl, unsigned char *md, int send)
{
  SSL3_RECORD *rec;
  unsigned char *mac_sec,*seq;
  EVP_MD_CTX md_ctx;
  ...

  if (send)
  {
    rec= &(ssl->s3->wrec);
    mac_sec= &(ssl->s3->write_mac_secret[0]);
    seq= &(ssl->s3->write_sequence[0]);
    hash=ssl->write_hash;
  }
  else
  {
    rec= &(ssl->s3->rrec);
    mac_sec= &(ssl->s3->read_mac_secret[0]);
    seq= &(ssl->s3->read_sequence[0]);
    hash=ssl->read_hash;
  }
  ...

TLS also uses the ssl->s3 member. For example, from t1_enc.c around line 445:
mac_secret= &(s->s3->write_mac_secret[0]);
mac_secret_size = &(s->s3->write_mac_secret_size);

You might also be able to get a good look at the data in the SSL* object with SSL_SESSION_print using a BIO or SSL_SESSION_print_fp.

","The reason is that cData created by

includes the terminating NUL-character of the message string and that is counted in
UInt(cData.count) as well. You could fix that by using UInt(strlen(cData)) instead,
as in your Objective-C code.
But a better solution is to convert the input strings
to NSData objects instead:
let cKey = RestUtils.API_KEY.dataUsingEncoding(NSASCIIStringEncoding)!
let cData = message.dataUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding)!

var cHMAC = [CUnsignedChar](count: Int(CC_SHA1_DIGEST_LENGTH), repeatedValue: 0)
CCHmac(CCHmacAlgorithm(kCCHmacAlgSHA1), cKey.bytes, UInt(cKey.length), cData.bytes, UInt(cData.length), &cHMAC)

This method of hmac hashing seems to be pretty universally accepted so I would expect to see consistent output length. What am I missing?
","If I remember correctly, CCHmac outputs its result in binary form, so when this function finishes, output[] should always be filled with exactly 20 bytes.
Recall that strlen() just iterates through memory until it finds a 'null' byte, e.g.
int strlen(char *s)
{
  for(int n = 0; s[n] != 0; s++)
  {
    n++;
  }
  return n;
}

So, if it happens that one of the bytes in output[] is 0, then your NSLog statement will print out a value less than 20. Otherwise, strlen() will continue searching into undefined regions of memory until it happens to find a value of 0 somewhere. You will get largely unpredictable results, and this could actually make your program crash.
Instead, it looks like you may be expecting a hex-string representation of the HMAC. To get one, you could do something like:
NSMutableString *hexOutput = [NSMutableString string];
for (int i = 0; i < CC_SHA1_DIGEST_LENGTH; i++) {
    [hexOutput appendFormat:@""%02x"", output[i]];
}

My modified code is 10 digit TOTP
I appreciate help from everyone!
","The example 64 byte seed in Appendix A of RFC 6238 is the HEX encoded version of the ASCII secret 12345678901234567890 provided in Appendix B which contains the truth table. 
ASCII 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
HEX   31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 30

If you want to convert your shared secret using the same pattern, you would convert abc@example.comTEXT5 to HEX in string format if you're using the example code provided in Appendix A.
This would come out to the following HEX string :
616263406578616D706C652E636F6D5445585435
To build the example 64 byte seed used for the SHA-512 hash the initial 20 bytes are repeated to make 64 bytes total to achieve an optimal key length for the SHA-512 hash. 
Doing the same with your example string would produce the following seed:
String seed64 = ""616263406578616D706C652E636F6D5445585435"" +
         ""616263406578616D706C652E636F6D5445585435"" +
         ""616263406578616D706C652E636F6D5445585435"" +
         ""61626340"";

If you use the rest of the example code to calculate the time step and request a 10 digit TOTP code, I assume it will work for you. 
If you are using something like this in production, you may wish to use a more randomly generated secret. 
For example, to generate a 64 byte secret for SHA-512, you could do something like:
  public static String generateRawSecret(int length) {
    byte[] buf = new byte[length];
    new SecureRandom().nextBytes(buf);
    String rawSecret = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(buf);
    return rawSecret.substring(1, length + 1);
  }

  // Random 64 byte secret
  String secret = generateRawSecret(64);

It looks like you've already got most of this coded, but if you're looking for some additional Java examples, the following link is a GitHub project that has a simple utility class with a bunch of tests. https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-2FA

","Make sure the nonce in your signature comes last in your signature for any request that takes params, e.g. for money/wallet/history with currency USD your signature should be:
money/wallet/history\0currency=USD&nonce=xxxxxxxxxx

(the \0 is a null character, just in case you're wondering)
Also, MtGox's API seems to be in flux right now - for example, for wallet history above, we used to call:
BTCUSD/money/wallet/history

as the API endpoint, but this no longer seems to work. Now we call:
money/wallet/history

So if calls that used to work for you are now failing, take a look at that too.  But I can tell you for sure that having your nonce as the last param in your QS for your signature is critical or your API calls will no longer work.
I also recommend re-creating a new API key in MtGox -we had to do so in order for our code to work properly as well. I have a hunch that this is because MtGox's recent API changes have invalidated old keys (likely to keep trading bots at bay while they figure out how to handle them without having the bots kill their API)

","You mean ""Binary bitwise operations""?

The & operator yields the bitwise AND of its arguments, which must be plain or long integers. The arguments are converted to a common type.
The ^ operator yields the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) of its arguments, which must be plain or long integers. The arguments are converted to a common type.
The | operator yields the bitwise (inclusive) OR of its arguments, which must be plain or long integers. The arguments are converted to a common type.

[update]
Since you can't xor a string and a number, you should either:

convert the number to a string padded to the same size and xor each byte (may give you all sort of strange ""escape"" problems with some chars, for example, accidentally generating invalid unicode)
use the raw value (20 byte integer?) of the digest to xor and make an hexdigest of the resulting number.

Something like this (untested):
pad = hmac.new(secret_key, msg=unique_id, digestmod=hashlib.sha1).digest()
rawpad = reduce(lambda x, y: (x << 8) + y, 
            [ b for b in struct.unpack('B' * len(pad), pad)])
enc_price = ""%X"" % (rawpad ^ price)

","The pad, and the plaintext ""price"" are each to be interpreted as a stream of bits. For each corresponding bit in the two streams, you take the ""exclusive OR"" of the pair of bits - if the bits are the same, you emit 0, if the bits are different, you emit 1. This operation is interesting because it's reversible: plaintext XOR pad -> ciphertext, and ciphertext XOR pad -> plaintext. 
However, in Python, you won't usually do the XORing yourself because it's tedious and overly complex for a newbie; you want to use a popular encryption library such as PyCrypto to do the work.

","I don't know what Hashing class you are using in Java, because it isn't standard, but if I use the standard class javax.crypto.Mac to do HmacSHA256 (NOT HmacSHA1) with that key and data -- and encode with the 'unpadded URLsafe' variant of Base64 promoted by JSON, not the traditional one Java defaults to -- I do get ruEWRoFO-ic-L38vTsjqIYE6DLZ532CTaZXOh1gwuVo.
However, it is very poor practice to sign the path and query without some delimiting -- this may allow a signature to be 'moved' to different data. It is also weird, though not directly dangerous, to use a key that is characters but only hex digit characters. I wouldn't use a scheme designed like this for anything important without extensive investigation.

","The Windows code takes the string, interprets it as a hexadecimal number, and converts two characters a time into one byte. 
Your Mac code most like takes the string as it is. Since the key starts with ""71"", your windows code takes that as a single byte with value 0x71 = 129, your Mac code takes it as two bytes with values '7' = 55 and '1' = 49. 
All you need to do is convert the bytes on the Mac exactly as you do it on Windows. You might have to do the unthinkable and look at the source code of the Mac library to see how it does the actual hash calculation.

You can use this extension to convert the hex string to Data
// Modified slightly http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26501276/converting-hex-string-to-nsdata-in-swift
extension String {

    func dataFromHexadecimalString() -> Data? {
        var data = Data(capacity: characters.count / 2)

        let regex = try! NSRegularExpression(pattern: ""[0-9a-f]{1,2}"", options: .caseInsensitive)
        regex.enumerateMatches(in: self, options: [], range: NSMakeRange(0, characters.count)) { match, flags, stop in
            let byteString = (self as NSString).substring(with: match!.range)
            var num = UInt8(byteString, radix: 16)
            data.append(&num!, count: 1)
        }

        return data
    }
}

And to use do something like:
    let secret = ""71DD0F73AFFBB47825FF9864DDE95F3B""
    let value = ""Amount=50&BillerID=59&ChannelID=2&Context=34|check|test&ReturnURL=https://uat.myfatoora.com/ReceiptPOC.aspx&TxnRefNum=000000000020003&UserName=DCS""

    print(""\(generateHMAC(key: secret, data: value))"")

","Not an expert at this, but NSASCIIStringEncoding seems to imply that you want data and secret interpreted as ASCII, whereas String.getBytes() uses the default character set by default (i.e. UTF-8).
You probably need to use a different charset:
data.getBytes(StandardCharsets.US_ASCII);
secret.getBytes(StandardCharsets.US_ASCII);

For Java pre-1.7, you'll need to use this and catch the UnsupportedEncodingException:
data.getBytes(""US-ASCII"");
secret.getBytes(""US-ASCII"");

Authentication is done in an AuthenticationFilter.
For the comparison of the HMAC key with the one provided by the client I need to read Request.Content. Everything is fine until here.
In ParameterBinding I also need to read from Request.Content. This works fine, until content is not multipart/form-data. StringContent and ByteArrayContent can be read multiple times via content.ReadAsStringAsync() / content.ReadAsByteArrayAsync(), but ReadAsMultipartAsync() can only be called once.
So, after authentication I can not read content again (e.g. in ParamterBinding) for extracting data / images etc from the request content.
I read that ReadAsStringAsync() / ReadAsByteArrayAsync() calls LoadIntoBufferAsync() internally, which loads request content into a memory buffer. But doing this with my multipart content does not solve this problem.
Exception is:

"49098943","How and where to store secret key(s) of your REST API with HMAC based signing","I'm building REST API that should be acceseble for other developers. To authenticate clients I decided to use HMAC-SHA256 request signing with API key and secret key.
So the proccess of authentication looks like this:

Along with the request body, client sends headers, containing his API key and signature generated using some data (request body/date/etc) + secret key
Server recieves requests and check if API key is valid and not revoked
Server gets secret key from somewhere and generates signature by the same algorythm as client did
If both signatures (recieved from client and generated on server) are the same, request is authenticated

Everything's here is very clear and simple. But the question is: 
where and how should I store that secret key and should it be the only one for all clients or different for each one of them. 
I've read tons of articles, with lots of good examples of how to implement this kind of request authentication, but none of them tell how should I store secret key - in database, or in some document, located at server's FS. As I understood, both API key and secret key should not be encrypted. Because first one is used only for identifying or revoking client and second one should be fast accessible for server to create and compare signature.
And returning to the second part of question, should it be the only one secret key for all the users or private for each user? If it would be the only one key, it's simple to hide it on server, e.g. in environment variable. But what if it should be compromised on client's side? In this case I should change secret key and it will block my API for all of my other clients...
I found some information about security and effects of compromising here: Using HMAC-SHA1 for API authentication - how to store the client password securely?
But still no useful information about storing.

However when I try to do this same with Python I am getting different results which are wrong.

    key = bytes(key, 'UTF-8')
    message = bytes(message, 'UTF-8')

    signature2 = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(signature1)

result = make_digest('123', 'secret')
print(result)

This code gives result:

What could be wrong with this code?
","You should not use Base64 here. The site you link to gives you the hex values of the digest bytes. Use the HMAC.hexdigest() method to get the same value in hex in Python:
>>> key = b'secret'
>>> message = b'123'
>>> digester = hmac.new(key, message, hashlib.sha1)
>>> digester.hexdigest()
'b14e92eb17f6b78ec5a205ee0e1ab220fb7f86d7'

put differently, your code outputs the correct value, but as Base64-encoded data:
>>> digester.digest()
b'\xb1N\x92\xeb\x17\xf6\xb7\x8e\xc5\xa2\x05\xee\x0e\x1a\xb2 \xfb\x7f\x86\xd7'
>>> base64.urlsafe_b64encode(digester.digest())
b'sU6S6xf2t47FogXuDhqyIPt_htc='

and the value you generated online contains the exact same bytes as the hex digest, so we can generate the same base64 output for that:
>>> bytes.fromhex('b14e92eb17f6b78ec5a205ee0e1ab220fb7f86d7')
b'\xb1N\x92\xeb\x17\xf6\xb7\x8e\xc5\xa2\x05\xee\x0e\x1a\xb2 \xfb\x7f\x86\xd7'

Note that there could be problems with the encoding. Try calculating the hmac of something like àèéìòù to see which encoding the PHP is using.

From my reading it sounds as though HMAC-SHA384 does need byte-swapping if the transmission endianness (big-endian in my case) does not match machine endianness.  The swapping should occur from byte 0 and 47, 1 and 46, so on?  Can anyone more knowledgeable in the subject than I confirm or contradict this please?
I am presently using the .NET HMACSHA384 class, but on the other end I will be writing C++ code and don't yet know what library will provide the HMAC code.
","leppie is right, both are send as byte arrays. And you can be pretty sure that the byte array received will conform to NIST specifications and test vectors. So you should not overly worry about endianness in this case.
If there are people that need to worry then it is the implementors of the hash function. E.g. NIST unfortunately specified a little endian machine (Intel processor) as reference platform for SHA-3. The first version of Skein had incorrect test vectors because of a bug regarding endianness in the first iteration (1.0).

unsigned char result[EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE];

","The code doesn't understand how the pack() function actually works. The key is what is different between the PHP and Perl scripts, so let's reduce it to just that calculation. Here's a simpler PHP program:
<?php
  $key = pack('H*', 'THIS_IS_KEY');
  echo $key;
?>

If we echo that into php | hexdump, we get:
00000000 0000 0000 000e

Here's a similar Perl program:
my $key = pack('H*', 'THIS_IS_KEY');
print $key;

And if we echo that into perl | hexdump, we get:
0000000 2cd1 cff2 204e

Those are two significantly different keys. In both cases, the pack() call is using an H* format, which means that pack() is expecting to receive an unbounded hex string (a string containing hexadecimal characters 0-9A-F). The problem is that 'THIS_IS_KEY' is not a sequence of hex values (with the exception of the 'E'). If you run the test code through the php binary itself, you'll also see these lines:
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit T in - on line 2
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit H in - on line 2
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit I in - on line 2
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit S in - on line 2
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit _ in - on line 2
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit I in - on line 2
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit S in - on line 2
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit _ in - on line 2
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit K in - on line 2
PHP Warning:  pack(): Type H: illegal hex digit Y in - on line 2

Note that it's every character except for 'E' that throws an error, and note that in your hex output, every character gets converted to a null nibble except for 'E'. Perl actually tries to make something of nonsense characters and converts them to some sort of representation it can use (e.g. 'K' becomes 4, which kind of makes sense since it's the 5th character after F, which would correspond to 14 in hex). Anyway, it's undefined what the behavior should be passed a string that doesn't match the format.
So, what are your solutions?
Well, if you really need to keep 'THIS_IS_KEY' as your key, then the equivalent Perl key is '000000000E0'. If your example key is only a representation of the key value, generally replace the non-hex characters from the PHP key with '0' in the Perl script. PHP appears to be treating non-hex characters as '0' in the hex string.
As for a real solution, either convert your string key to a hex representation or use a straight hex value as your key before passing to pack(). I don't know the details of the key selection or why the ""key"" is being packed anyway. The SHA256 portion of the code just takes a byte-string as the key. It could be a straight ASCII key as far as it's concerned, as long as both scripts use the same sequence of bytes.

One (wrong) attempt in PHP is this:
function encode($data,$key)
{
    return base64_encode( hash_hmac('sha256', $data, $key ) );
}

The ANSWER
A slight variation of what was suggested below by DampeS8N worked for me. 
function encode($data,$key)
{
    iconv_set_encoding(""input_encoding"", ""ASCII"");
    iconv_set_encoding(""internal_encoding"", ""ASCII"");
    iconv_set_encoding(""output_encoding"", ""ASCII"");

    return base64_encode( hash_hmac('sha256', $data, $key, true ) );
}

Please also not the fourth parameter of hash_hmac - now set to true for raw output as binary data
","I suspect the very first line of your .net code is the culprit. PHP has no encoding for the string itself and so when it comes time to hash it either is hashing the internal PHP string format's bytes (unlikely, can someone else confirm?) or more than likely is converting to something else first. In this case probably unicode which is decidedly not the same bytes that the string would be in ASCII as .net is requesting.
My advice would be to ensure that PHP is also using ASCII, with iconv, to allow interoperability.
function encode($data,$key)
{
    return base64_encode( hash_hmac('sha256', iconv( iconv_get_encoding( ""internal_encoding""), ""ASCII"", $data ), iconv( iconv_get_encoding( ""internal_encoding""), ""ASCII"", $key ) ) );
}

I can't be sure that the above code will output the desired hashes, however, as I don't have .net handy to test the initial code. But this might point you in the right direction.
If this doesn't work, the value inside iconv_get_encoding( might be the culprit, try ""output_encoding"" or ""input_encoding"" as well. It is also possible that you'll need to set these same values to ASCII with iconv_set_encoding(.
Good Luck!

Update! This is what ultimately worked:
function encode($data,$key)
{
    iconv_set_encoding(""input_encoding"", ""ASCII"");
    iconv_set_encoding(""internal_encoding"", ""ASCII"");
    iconv_set_encoding(""output_encoding"", ""ASCII"");

    return base64_encode( hash_hmac('sha256', $data, $key, true ) );

or use a user-based authentication protocol like oAuth.

I have thought about why they might require API clients to sign requests:

intermediate proxies might canonicalize URLs and mess up the original query string order
The URI RFC specifies absolutely nothing about the order of the query string parameters, or that it should be preserved

My best guess is that, because of the RFC, Amazon reckoned they'd play it safe and require both sides to sign the ORDERED request.
I do, however, would like the final/official word on this. Surely the implementors had a good reason for this requirement.
","The request signature ensures that the sender and receiver can agree on exactly what was sent in the request and that no intermediate parties tampered with it.
Many parts of an HTTP request can change without changing the semantics of the request. For example the HTTP headers can be re-ordered, as can the query parameters as you rightly point out.
So the request must be canonicalized into a form that removes these ambiguities and that both parties will use to sign the request. Otherwise each party could generate different signatures for the same request. Ordering the query parameters is just part of this process. Amazon describes their canonicalization process and their motivation in the docs for the AWS V4 signature format.

Here is the Javascript:

  var secret = '33fsfsdgvwrg2g223f4f42gf4f34f43f';
  var message = 'methodurldatatimestamp';
  var shaObj = new jsSHA(message, ""ASCII"");
  document.write(shaObj.getHMAC(secret, ""ASCII"", ""SHA-1"", ""HEX""));

Note that the Javascript code puts the full message ('methodurldatatimestamp') in the jsSHA constructor. I believe this is the key to your problem. Hope this helps!

","I can't tell from your post but those are quite possibly exactly the same results, formatted differently. 
Your code returns the raw result of the HMAC operation - this is arbitrary binary data so it's not going to print as anything readable. Amazon expect you to provide the hex representation for each byte: your first couple of bytes are ""\xae\xee"" instead of ""aeee""
The easiest way to do this is call hexdigest rather than digest. Note that you should only do this for the final HMAC (when you sign the string to sign with the signing key) not when constructing the signing key

}
The usage is to setup a sufficient size buffer or somewhere in the main applet class and then calling like the example below:
byte[] hmacBuff = JCSystem.makeTransientByteArray((short) 128, JCSystem.CLEAR_ON_RESET);
hmac.init(MessageDigest.ALG_SHA_256, hmacKey);
hmac.doFinal(incomingMsg, (short) 0, (short) incomingMsg.length, hmacBuff, (short) 0, outgoingMsg, (short) 0);

I double checked it with a standard Java implementation with the following parameters:
HMAC Key Bytes(16):8A560AB02C32377FE3D1BEABE666A19B
HMAC Challenge Bytes(16):8B4F35ADB59D27ABFE95A3CAAB0B613B

And the card's result is 5CB05D1B2CD3F711A853F7166366246743C58509E84D6B8B6C37FF00D6F07619. Assuming the HMAC keys are properly synchronized in the JavaCard and on the sample desktop application. Am I missing something in my HMAC source code ?
","These lines caused the issue:
if (hashAlgo == 4) {
        outSize = (short) 32; // SHA-256
        //!!! missing: blockSize = (short) 64;
} else if (hashAlgo == 5) {
        outSize = (short) 48; // SHA-384            
        blockSize = (short) 128;
} else if (hashAlgo == 6) {
        outSize = (short) 64; // SHA-512            
        blockSize = (short) 128;
}

For SHA-256 the blockSize remains unchanged, so SHA-256 after SHA-384 or SHA-512 inherits the wrong value (128 instead of 64).

There are a few more things to improve:

outSize is not necessary, use md.getLength() instead. outSize must not be stored in persistent memory, it is rewritten very often. This applies to blockSize, too.
do not create new instances of MessageDigest each time you call init, you will run out of persistent memory. Create all instances you need in the constructor.
ctr must not be stored in persistent memory. It is a temporary variable and should be moved to RAM. You rewrite this variable very often and it can damage your card.
ArrayLogic.arrayCopyRepack should be replaced with Util.arrayCopyNonAtomic from standard Java Card library - your applet would be faster and more portable
create all buffers you need just once, not each time you call init (secretKey,secretIpad,secretOpad). Btw, you could have just one buffer and keep offsets only...
call md.reset() only when it is necessary, you do not have to call it each time before md.doFinal(...)


The last (obvious) note: If supported by your card, always use Signature.ALG_HMAC_SHA_XXX instead. It will be much faster than any solution you can implement in Java Card on your own.

"24350427","REST API design with HMAC: How to handle security on first user registration","I would to implement a secure REST web service for a mobile app (using PHP).
The idea is to avoid the complexity of OAuth, so I've decided to use the HMAC approach.
I've read some articles like this.
Basically what I need to do is this:

[CLIENT] Before making an API request combine a bunch of data it will send (ie. the url params) and hash it with the private key assigned from the server (HASHED_KEY). This data is sent along with some sort of id/key which allows the server to identify who is the sender (ie. client id,or some sort of public id of the user, it does not matter, we'll call it USER_IDENTIFIER). So at the end we have a request URL with HASH_KEY+USER_IDENTIFIER (ie. mywebservice/users/list?hash=[HASH_KEY]&key=[USER_IDENTIFIER]).
[SERVER] Server receive this request, take (using USER_IDENTIFIER) the private key assigned to the user and HASH the same data hashed by client. If both hash keys (generated from client and generated from server) matches request can be trusted and executed.

(We can also avoid replay attacks and add some other security levels but that's the core).
My question is this:
My APIs should also allow user registration.
So there will be a call called /register_user where client should send at least desired username and password.
After that, server should reply with the private key (HASHED_KEY) client will use to encrypt all other requests.
So basically there is a flaw: this first communication is not secure.
How can I handle this?
My idea is to provide a private key for anonymous calls both on server and client which is used to encrypt data when I don't know yet the user identity. It will be used to secure both username+password while making registration call.
Is it okay? Any other solution?

"44545577","HMAC and SHA256 - how to validate using nonce","Im trying to integrate with a Web API. Looking at how they use SHA256 and HMAC to generate their signature.  However they also use whats known as an ""nonce"", which I had to look up.  This api generates the ""signature"" using a secret that both of us know, combined with the url of the request.
So, do I use the same nonce they are using to generate a signature on my end to do the validation with?
Im looking at a sample of how they are generating their signature like this on the client end.
        var message = ""https://my.server.com/new-callback?reqID=test&nonce=8cf95201-4d3c-4397-9117-d7ee6ad89d93"";

However, I dont get the same result using this tool 
http://www.freeformatter.com/hmac-generator.html
So to validate this on my end (within the api), I need to use the same inputs to compute the signature and then simply compare the resulting strings, correct?  
What purpose does this ""nonce"" component serve?  From what Ive read, it more or less serves the same purpose as a GUID.
What am I missing?
","The output I get from http://www.freeformatter.com/hmac-generator.html is hex encoded and the value you provided (ihyCCfTHog7TDQYT4tQM5ISYSjEIaChSeJmIo3UMa+U=) is base64 encoded.
If you decode the base64 encoded message, convert it to hex and compare it to the result from freeformatter (which is 8a1c8209f4c7a20ed30d0613e2d40ce484984a3108682852789988a3750c6be5) - they both match. You might be interested in https://stackoverflow.com/a/12987042/3906760 for conversion functions.
And yes: You compute the HMAC on both sides and compare the result. If it matches (no no one else knows the secret) you're safe.
The nonce is a random value in order to prevent replay-attacks (cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce).

There was a similiar problem here, but I can't adapt the solution to work for me. I am new to python and I don't know where to change the code in order to make use of the shared key. 
This is the slightly adapted code from the answer:
import csv
import hashlib
import hmac
import base64

IN_PATH = 'test.csv'
OUT_PATH = 'test_hashed.csv'
ENCODING = 'utf8'
HASH_COLUMNS = dict(Mail='md5')


def main():
    with open(IN_PATH, 'rt', encoding=ENCODING, newline='') as in_file, \
            open(OUT_PATH, 'wt', encoding=ENCODING, newline='') as out_file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(in_file)
        writer = csv.DictWriter(out_file, reader.fieldnames)
        writer.writeheader()
        for row in reader:
            for column, method in HASH_COLUMNS.items():
                data = row[column].encode(ENCODING)
                digest = hashlib.new(method, data).hexdigest()
                row[column] = '0x' + digest.upper()
            writer.writerow(row)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

The input file (.csv) looks like this:
Mail
DHSKA@gmail.com
DJÖANw12@gmail.com
JSNÖS83@ymail.com
HDKDLSA@gmail.com
KKKDLAmS19@yamil.com

And with the code above, the output file looks like this:
0xB6A77B6EB853CC4CC8342B312293FA9C
0xEB439592D8EEC2A38A597350EF80E512

0x415E067487C4A5FBDB86AB0F855DB114

But since I do want to use a HMAC with secret key and sha256, the above solution doesn't work for me and I don't know how to incorporate this approach. 
The key would be something like this: 
123Abc

I was trying to do something like this, but for the whole file:
import hmac
import hashlib
import base64

secret = ""123Abc""
secret_bytes = bytes(secret, 'latin-1')
data = ""DHSKA@gmail.com""
data_bytes = bytes(data, 'latin-1')

digest = hmac.new(secret_bytes, msg=data_bytes, digestmod=hashlib.sha256).digest()
signature = base64.b64encode(digest).decode()

Thus, my question is how I can incorporate the HMAC SHA 256 hashing wile using the a secret key, in the above code? I just can't figure out which parameters to change?
","I don't think you need to trouble yourself with the dictionary; you don't have a variable number of columns here, you are applying your transformation to just one column.
It'll be easier to follow if you just put your working HMAC method into a function:
import hmac
import hashlib
import base64

secret = ""123Abc""
secret_bytes = bytes(secret, 'latin-1')

def create_signature(email, secret_bytes):
    data_bytes = email.encode('latin-1')
    digest = hmac.new(secret_bytes, msg=data_bytes, digestmod=hashlib.sha256).digest()
    signature = base64.b64encode(digest).decode()
    return signature

This now neatly produces a Base64 string with a HMAC digest from an email address and your (encoded) secret:
>>> create_signature('DHSKA@gmail.com', secret_bytes)
'3KaSw4QeA5l0rz49uutaDGemn4Et4CQnbnngm6mmpjE='

Now you can apply that to the 'Mail' column values, and write out the new CSV with the results:
with open(IN_PATH, 'rt', encoding=ENCODING, newline='') as in_file, \
        open(OUT_PATH, 'wt', encoding=ENCODING, newline='') as out_file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(in_file)
    writer = csv.DictWriter(out_file, reader.fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()
    for row in reader:
        row['Mail'] = create_signature(row['Mail'], secret_bytes)
        writer.writerow(row)

Demo:
>>> import sys, csv, io
>>> demo_input = io.StringIO('''\

Access to any API endpoint requires authentication via signed requests, created with publicand secret API

I have the keys defined above.

The signature is an HMAC­SHA256 hash of a string containing the request content­type, host,

I understand each request needs to be signed.  
How do I sign an http request with Delphi XE6?
The confusion for me at the moment is it seems Delphi has a number of built-in components have accessing RSET servers and parsing the JSON returned. I can't see any obvious way of signing requests using these components.

","Why not store the string BASE64 encoded? That way you don't need to worry about line breaks, whitespace, anything like that.
Seeing as your php code is storing the key (apparently) correctly, try a script like:
<?
$doggy_key = ....;
echo base64_encode($doggy_key);

Run it from the command-line, copy the encoded key, then use it in your javascript.
Decoding base64 strings is a simple problem, for example;

"11833135","How do I share my mobile app's secret key with the server the first time I generate it?","So I am working on a mobile app right now that will be making requests to a REST API built with Django.
In order to secure the API I plan on using a private/public key pair authentication system.
The workflow I have thought out goes something like this:

The user logs in using Facebook
Once the user signs the app generates a private key
The private key is shared between the server and the app so that the server knows to map that private key to a specific user.
Every time the mobile app makes a request the app generates an HMAC/signature using the request parameters and the private key. In addition to the HMAC the app also sends the user_id of the user who sent it (this will act as the public key).
When the server receives the request it generates its own HMAC. Its takes the user_id and looks up the private key in a table. Using the private key it recreates the HMAC with the request parameters and compares it to the HMAC that the mobile app sent. If the server and the mobile have matching HMACs then it performs the request.

Now my problem lies in step 3 where the private key has to somehow be shared between the mobile app and the server. How can I securely send the private key?
","I would start by asking why the server part of your app needs to know the private key. If it only wants to authenticate a user, it only needs the public key and the user id, and the user id cannot iself be the public key (you need a way to find out which public key to use).
For instance, the process of sharing the key, your step three, could look something like this:

The app generates a public-private key pair.
The app sends the public key to the server, not caring who can intercept it.
The server stores that public key, associating it with the id the user provided.

Maybe the integration into Facebook is the part that makes this impossible. I do not quite understand how Facebook comes into this whole process.
One thing that can make the transfer of a key slightly more secure is to use multiple channels to transfer it.
For instance, your application could send the private key that was generated using your REST API but encrypting it with a symmetric encryption scheme. The symmetric encryption key can be sent via some other medium, such as email, or through SMS since this is a mobile app, or maybe even an automated phone call placed to a number provided by the registering user. The key can be a random passphrase that generates the actual symmetric encryption key, to make sure it is something that can be typed in by the user. Then, to unlock the app, the user needs to type in this passphrase into a screen and the secret key is unlocked.
Again, this only improves the security of the transfer by a small margin, especially considering the fact that if you can intercept the transmission of the private key, you can probably intercept the email containing the passphrase. In my opinion, not sending the private key to the server would not only be optimal but required.

The problem is there're too many implementations that use solid pad parameters,

  opad would be [0x5c * blocksize].
The questions are:
Why do people use this two solid pads in the code? Are they the best choice?

and Since it's solid, is this algorithm really securer than H(H(key+msg)+key)?
By the way, I must say many documents about hashes and authentication are really horrible.

Is it because the NSA asks them to not be clear?      
","First, HMAC comes from academic researchers Bellare, Rogaway, and Krawczyk.  NSA never touched HMAC, the standard is exactly as defined by the academic researchers.

Register for an account with them and generate a public/private key set. Then for each API call:

","
What purpose does the timestamp and its derived SHA-1 hash serve? Why is it less secure to just require users send me their public/private keys with each API call?

To clear any misunderstanding you seem to have up front, the user should never send the private key over the network. The private key is to stay private. It is a secret shared between you and the user. Reread the Gengo link, you'll see that it is only used as a parameter to the HMAC function. It is up to the user to find a way to secure it, but your API does not need it to verify calls.
The timestamp serves two purposes. First it is a piece of data for which you will get both the plaintext and the HMAC. You will be recomputing the HMAC on your side with the private key of the user. If the HMAC checks, it means that not only the timestamp was not tampered with, but also that only someone knowing the private key could have sent it. It provides integrity and authenticity for that piece of data.
If it was a simple SHA1, a attacker could have intercepted the message, changed the timestamp, and recomputed the hash. By using a keyed hash, you ensure that the sender is who you think he is.
The second purpose for the timestamp is to prevent replay attacks. Even if using a keyed hash, the attacker could have captured an old request and send it again, possibly triggering unwanted actions. If your users hash the time and you test it and reject requests that are unreasonably old, you can prevent such replay attacks.  

Is this pubkey + privkey + hashed_timestamp method that Gengo is using a standardized practice for API auth? If so, does it have a name/algorithm? Are there other, equally-secure competitors to it?

Again the privkey is not sent through the pipe. Using HMAC for API authentication is quite common. It is used for Amazon Web Services for example. When used in the Gengo way, the fact that there is seemingly a public/private key pair can be confusing, it is really still symmetric cryptography, and the private key is used as a shared secret.
However I think it is better to include more than just the timestamp in the data that is HMAC'ed. Otherwise an attacker could tamper with other parts of the request. The headers, the HTTP verb, and a hash of the content of the request should be included as well.
Another scheme is to use the private key on client side to sign (encrypt with the private key) a piece of data, so the server only needs to verify it with the public key of the client and needs not know the private key of the client. Embedding a time information is still needed to prevent replays. I do not know much about this scheme, it might be hard to reliably link clients with a given public key in the first place.

What purpose does this
  HMAC serve and why does it require 3 arguments (SHA-1, the timestamp
  and the private key)?

An HMAC is a keyed hash. Consider the simplest form of message authentication: hash(key + message). It was found that this was not secure (see length extension attack) and a nested structure fixes the vulnerability. 
HMAC is a generic name of that structure: hash(k1 + hash(k2 + message)), where k1 and k2 are derived from the actual secret key. So when we do an HMAC we need to pass the name of the actual hash algorithm that will be used (here SHA-1), the message (here, the timestamp), and the secret key.

Finally, what do I do with the 3 parameters (pub key, priv key, hashed
  timestamp) on the server-side to perform authentication? If I was
  designing a system that only used the pub/priv keys, then I would
  treat them like a username/password combo and would check the database
  to see if that combo existed or not. But the hashed timestamp is
  really throwing me off here.

Hopefully clearer by now. You use the public key as an identifier to retrieve the private key. You take the ts header and recompute the HMAC of it with the private key. If it matches with the hmac header sent, the request is authentic. You check the actual timestamp to see if it's not an old request replayed by some attacker. If all checks, the call can go through. I think it's better to embed all the important information in the HMAC, not just a timestamp though.

","You need either public key cryptography or an HMAC, not both.
Let's come back to the timestamp later, and you're confusing authentication with integrity, which we'll also come back to later.
Authentication: in your case this is where the client proves knowledge of some secret to the server. Two common ways to do this are via public key cryptography and using an HMAC.

PKC: before using the service a public/private key pair is generated. The client has the private key; the server has the public key. Important: the private key never leaves the client. In particular, the server does not have access to the private key. To authenticate, the client encrypts some random value N (called a nonce), and sends N and its encrypted form to the server. The server uses the public key to decrypt the encrypted nonce and confirms that it equals the supplied nonce. This proves to the server that the client has the private key.
HMAC: client and server agree a shared secret K beforehand. To authenticate, the client creates a nonce N, computes HMAC(K, N), and sends N and HMAC(K, N) to the server. The server also computes HMAC(K, N) since it knows the shared secret and has received N from the client. If the computed and received HMAC(K, N) values are the same then the server knows that the client has the shared secret K.

The HMAC approach has one significant weakness compared with PKC: if the server is compromised then the attacked gains knowledge of K and can then use that to masquerade as the client.
If using PKC, ideally generate the keypair on the client and send the public key to the server. That way the server never has the private key.
However, unless the communication channel is confidential (e.g. uses SSL/TLS), both approaches have a problem: replay attacks. A passive observer can record the N+encrypted form, or N+HMAC(K,N) and replay them to the server. The server will then think that the observer is a valid client.
Two standard defences are:

Use a time-based nonce.
The server remembers previously-seen nonces, and rejects new requests that use a previously-seen nonce.

That's where the timestamp comes in, and is discussed in more detail here: Should I sign (with a public/private key) a form based authentication (no SSL)?
Integrity: we've proved to the server that we're a valid client, but we haven't provided any protection of the request itself. An attacker could modify our request in flight: we'd authenticate correctly but then execute the attacker's request rather than the client's original request.
To resolve this we need to protect the integrity of the request. We can do this with the same mechanism as above. Rather than just using a nonce (N) or nonce+timestamp, include the entire request in the data been encrypted or hashed. An important consideration here is that encrypted and hashing operate on bytes, not REST requests. You therefore need a reliable way to convert the REST request (i.e. HTTP method, URL, request parameters) into bytes. This is often called ""canonicalisation"": the client and server must both canonicalise the request in exactly the same way, so that they are encrypting/hashing the same bytes given the request.
This whole process is standardised in things like OAuth, e.g.  https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/authorizing-request
To answer your specific questions:

The timestamp defends against replay attacks: passive observers can't reply a client's session. The SHA-1 hash is used as a component of the HMAC.
Yes, to a point. But I'd use a fully-fledged implementation of it rather than rolling your own, such as something OAuth-based.
An HMAC is a keyed hash: it's like a standard cryptographic hash (such as SHA-1, except that you also include a shared secret key in the hash. Simply concatenating the key to the data being hashed has cryptographic weaknesses that the HMAC construct avoids. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC.)
If you're using PKC then you look up the client's public key on the server (based on some client ID, which ist not the client's private key), use that to decrypt the encrypted request, and verify that that request matches the received request. If you're using HMAC then you look up the client's shared secret, canonicalise the request, compute HMAC(K, R) and verify that it matches the received HMAC(K, R). In both cases you must also verify timestamps/nonces to protected against replays.

BUT: rule #1 of crypto: don't roll your own. Use an established mechanism, such as OAuth. You probably also want to use SSL/TLS, which would then also let you use client certificates as a third authentication option. If you used those then you could also rely on SSL/TLS to give you integrity and replay protection. However, implementing SSL/TLS certificate validation correctly seems to fox many developers...

  header = { ""accept"" => ""application/json"", ""x-ms-version"" => serv_version, ""x-ms-date"" => date, ""authorization"" => auth_token }
  RestClient.get url, header
end

EDIT2: I believe I've isolated the problem to how I am doing the master key authentication.
Taking Ryan's example we can trim his node code down the following:
var crypto = require(""crypto"")

function encode_message(masterKey, message) {
    var key = new Buffer(masterKey, ""base64""); // encode/decode? base64 the masterKey
    var body = new Buffer(message.toLowerCase(), ""utf8""); // convert message to ""utf8"" and lower case
    return crypto.createHmac(""sha256"", key).update(body).digest(""base64""); // encrypt the message using key
 }

If I call this node code I can produce the following key:
encode_message(""blah"", 'get\ncolls\n\nTue, 14 Apr 2015 13:34:22 GMT\n\n')
'IYlLuyZtVLx5ANkGMAxviDHgC/DJJXSj1gUGLvN0oM8='

If I produce the equivalent ruby code to create the authentication my ruby code looks like the following:
require 'base64'
require 'openssl'

def encode_message master_key, message
  key = Base64.urlsafe_decode64 master_key
  hmac = OpenSSL::HMAC.digest 'sha256', key, message
  Base64.urlsafe_encode64 hmac
end

If I call this code I get the following:
2.2.1 :021 > encode_message(""blah"", ""get\ncolls\n\nTue, 14 Apr 2015 13:34:22 GMT\n\n"")
 => ""N6BL3n4eSvYA8dIL1KzlTIvR3TcYpdqW2UNPtKWrjP8=""

Clearly the 2 encoded auth tokens are not the same. (Ryan again thanks so much for the help to get this far).
","i'll start off by apologizing for my limited Ruby knowledge but let me try assist here;
in your get_master_auth_token function it appears you are decoding the key before using it. is this correct? if so, why?
here is a node.js sample that uses the master key, builds up the auth header value and does a simple http call to list the collections in a database
var crypto = require(""crypto"");
var https = require(""https"");

https.globalAgent.options.secureProtocol = ""TLSv1_client_method"";

var verb = 'get'; 
var resourceType = 'dbs'; //the resource you are trying to get. dbs, colls, docs etc. 
var resourceId = ''; //the parent resource id. note: not the id, but the _rid. but for you, because you are trying to lookup list of databases there is no parent
var masterKey = '...'; //your masterkey 
var date = new Date().toUTCString();

var auth = getAuthorizationTokenUsingMasterKey(verb, resourceId, resourceType, date, masterKey);

var options = {
hostname: '...', //your hostname (without https://)
port: 443,
path: '/dbs/',
method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        accept: 'application/json',
        'x-ms-version': '2014-08-21',
        'x-ms-date': date,
        authorization: auth,
    }
};

for (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    var req = https.request(options, function (res) {
        process.stdout.write(new Date().toUTCString() + "" - statusCode: "" + res.statusCode + ""\n"");
        res.on('data', function (d) {
        }).on('error', function (e) {
        })
    });

    //console.log(req);

    req.end();
}

function getAuthorizationTokenUsingMasterKey(verb, resourceId, resourceType, date, masterKey) {
    var key = new Buffer(masterKey, ""base64"");

    var text = (verb || """") + ""\n"" + 
        (resourceType || """") + ""\n"" + 
        (resourceId || """") + ""\n"" + 
        (date || """") + ""\n"" + 
        ("""") + ""\n"";

    var body = new Buffer(text.toLowerCase(), ""utf8"");
    var signature = crypto.createHmac(""sha256"", key).update(body).digest(""base64"");

    var MasterToken = ""master"";    
    var TokenVersion = ""1.0"";

    return encodeURIComponent(""type="" + MasterToken + ""&ver="" + TokenVersion + ""&sig="" + signature);
}

In your example, the resourceId passed to the getAuthorizationTokenUsingMasterKey method should be """" and the resourceType should be ""dbs"" as you have it. 
I did notice that in some cases you have to URI Encode the value, but I think you are doing that already as the very last line of the func. 
the only difference I can spot in your code vs my code is that you appear to be decoding the master_key which I don't do. 
what I would recommend you do is run this node sample and compare the values of the strings we have in body & signature to the your values. they need to match.

"27320436","How to avoid Rest API abuse in Android?","We have developed a service with REST APIs and an Android app that leverages it. We currently don't require our users to authenticate.
We would like to implement a simple mechanism to prevent the random person from invoking the APIs from outside of the scope of the app, mainly to avoid abuses that would spoil the data that we compute.
I stumbled upon this url where they suggest to have authentication enforced by having the server and Android client to share a secret and use that to compute an HMAC to pass along with the request. They claim that they use this approach in Amazon (I have no experience with Amazon AWS yet).
I'm considering to proceed as follows:

store a common secret in the Server and in the Android app (any good idea for obfuscating it, besides using ProGuard?) 
Have client and server to communicate over plain HTTP (we don't need  confidentiality yet and we will save some CPU) and use the HMAC method to authenticate the calls as ""coming from a legitimate Android client"".
From time to time we can update the secret (perhaps at each new version of the app).
If in future we will need confidentiality we will enable TLS for the relevant REST calls.

Do you think that this solution would work? Is anyone using something like this? Alternatives? Advices?
Thanks.
","I am not a security expert.
Your solution sounds fine to protect you from ""the random person"", but you are still vulnerable to a dedicated attacker. Anything stored on the client can be dug out and used against you. ProGuard will dissuade a casual attacker, but against a dedicated attacker it's just a speed bump.
Nobody here is going to be able to tell you if that level of security is good enough, because it depends a lot on the specifics of your application. The final decision should rest with the product owner.

Calling it on a particular body with a particular hook-secret set, gives me ""sha1=VtNhKZDOHPU4COL2FSke2ArvtQE="". Meanwhile, the header I get from Github is sha1=56d3612990ce1cf53808e2f615291ed80aefb501.
Clearly, Github is printing in hex, but all my attempt to format the output as hex led to much longer strings than that one. What am I doing wrong?
","For future reference, here is a complete ring middleware for validating GitHub webhook calls in Clojure based on the answers in this and the cited threads:

jQuery Ajax 'data' can be any of the three data types:

Type: PlainObject or String or Array
Data to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string, if
  not already a string. It's appended to the url for GET-requests. See
  processData option to prevent this automatic processing. Object must
  be Key/Value pairs. If value is an Array, jQuery serializes multiple
  values with same key based on the value of the traditional setting
  (described below).

I believe, when jQuery.ajax ""processes""/""serialize""/""urlencode"" the data, it merges the parameters set in ajaxSetup. However, it doesn't seem like it does this before it gets to the  beforeSend hook.
$.ajaxSetup(
    beforeSend: (xhr, settings) ->
         console.log settings.data

will either spit out something like:

","Android has cut-down version of Bouncy Castle and seems not to allow access to org.bouncycastle.crypto.macs.HMac class, instead javax.crypto.Mac.getInstance(String algorithm) should be used (here). Again only some MAC algorithms seems to be allowed (I saw ""HMAC-SHA512"" is working). But if you decide to use SpongyCastle library, you can do this (here):

I use OpenSSL in C++ to compute a HMAC and compare them to a simular implementation using javax.crypto.Mac. For some keys the HMAC calculation is correct and for others there is a difference in HMAC. I believe the problem occurs when the keys get to big. Here are the details.
Here is the most important code for C++:
void computeHMAC(std::string message, std::string key){
    unsigned int digestLength = 20;
    HMAC_CTX hmac_ctx_;
    BIGNUM* key_ = BN_new();;

    BN_hex2bn(&key_, key); 

    unsigned char convertedKey[BN_num_bytes(key_)];
    BIGNUM* bn = BN_new();

    HMAC_CTX_init(&hmac_ctx_);

    BN_bn2bin(bn, convertedKey);
    int length = BN_bn2bin(key_, convertedKey);

    HMAC_Init_ex(&hmac_ctx_, convertedKey, length, EVP_sha1(), NULL);

/*Calc HMAC */
    std::transform( message.begin(), message.end(), message.begin(), ::tolower);
    unsigned char digest[digestLength];

    HMAC_Update(&hmac_ctx_, reinterpret_cast<const unsigned char*>(message.c_str()),
      message.length());
    HMAC_Final(&hmac_ctx_, digest, &digestLength);
    char mdString[40];
    for(unsigned int i = 0; i < 20; ++i){
        sprintf(&mdString[i*2], ""%02x"", (unsigned int)digest[i]);
    }
     std::cout << ""\n\nMSG:\n"" << message << ""\nKEY:\n"" + std::string(BN_bn2hex(key_)) + ""\nHMAC\n"" + std::string(mdString) + ""\n\n"";
}

The java test looks like this:
public String calculateKey(String msg, String key) throws Exception{

    HMAC = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA1"");

    BigInteger k = new BigInteger(key, 16);

    HMAC.init(new SecretKeySpec(k.toByteArray(), ""HmacSHA1""));

    msg = msg.toLowerCase();
    HMAC.update(msg.getBytes());
    byte[] digest = HMAC.doFinal();

    System.out.println(""Key:\n"" + k.toString(16) + ""\n"");
    System.out.println(""HMAC:\n"" + DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(digest).toLowerCase() + ""\n"");

    return DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(digest).toLowerCase();
}

I haven't determined the exact threshold. Can anyone spot the problem? Is there anyone capable of telling me which HMAC is incorrect in the last case by doing a simulation using different software or can anyone tell me which 3rd implementation I could use to check mine?

","When you convert a hexadecimal string to a BigInt in Java, it assumes the number is positive (unless the string includes a - sign).
But the internal representation of it is twos-complement. Meaning that one bit is used for the sign.
If you are converting a value that starts with a hex between 00 and 7F inclusive, then that's not a problem. It can convert the byte directly, because the leftmost bit is zero, which means that the number is considered positive.
But if you are converting a value that starts with 80 through FF, then the leftmost bit is 1, which will be considered negative. To avoid this, and keep the BigInteger value exactly as it is supplied, it adds another zero byte at the beginning.
So, internally, the conversion of a number such as 7ABCDE is the byte array
0x7a 0xbc 0xde

But the conversion of a number such as FABCDE (only the first byte is different!), is:
0x00 0xfa 0xbc 0xde

This means that for keys that begin with a byte in the range 80-FF, the BigInteger.toByteArray() is not producing the same array that your C++ program produced, but an array one byte longer.
There are several ways to work around this - like using your own hex-to-byte-array parser or finding an existing one in some library. If you want to use the one produced by BigInteger, you could do something like this:
BigInteger k = new BigInteger(key, 16);
byte[] kByteArr = k.toByteArray();
if ( kByteArr.length > (key.length() + 1) / 2 ) {
    kByteArr = Arrays.copyOfRange(kByteArr,1,kByteArr.length);
}

Now you can use the kByteArr to perform the operation properly.
Another issue you should watch out for is keys whose length is odd. In general, you shouldn't have a hex octet string that has an odd length. A string like F8ACB is actually 0F8ACB (which is not going to cause an extra byte in BigInteger) and should be interpreted as such. This is why I wrote (key.length() + 1) in my formula - if key is odd-length, it should be interpreted as a one octet longer. This is also important to watch out for if you write your own hex-to-byte-array converter - if the length is odd, you should add a zero at the beginning before you start converting.

","Options 2 and 3 are effectively the same assuming the static data is truly unguessable (and the same length etc).  If you are seriously concerned about somebody modifying the cookie then option 2 is better as (assuming the secret key is not shared) it would allow you to detect if changes had been made to the cookie and would prevent somebody from changing the cookie and then rerunning the hash to spoof the mac.  In practice, if the AES key is not accessible and the data in the cookie has some semantic meaning, you would likely be able to detect modifications to the encrypted cookie as it would decrypt to something meaningless.  From a security perspective though, option 2 would provide the greatest assurances that the data hadn't been modified.
All of that said, I'm making a number of assumptions about your setup that may or may not be true. 
Edit I evidently misunderstood the question with regards to the key data and did not clearly state enough of my assumptions.  @owlstead's is a better answer.

","The HMAC function should already be keyed. So normally HMAC is shown as HMAC(K, M) where K is the key and M is the message. So candidate 2 does not make sense in that regard; it would mean that the key K is included 3 times in the calculation (as the key is used two times in HMAC itself).
Using a cookie with unguessable data does not make sense either, for the same reason. Part of the input of HMAC is the key K, which is already unguessable data. So you would not gain any security, and you would be complicating your protocol.
Now AES should be used in CBC or CTR mode. ECB mode of encryption is unsafe. So that means you require a random IV (CBC) or a unique IV (CTR). This IV should be part of the HMAC, otherwise it is still possible for an attacker to alter the plaintext you get after decryption.

"43808961","Hashing passwords and signature with HMAC any security advantages?","I'm getting a bit confused about hashing passwords with a salt and the way of HMAC an password or using as a signature and so on. I've read a lot of articles about it but it seems that i don't got the point of using this or that.
I got this examples of using that ways (questions marked by a number):
Hashed passwords
Password from user is hashed with SHA-256 and a unique salt for each user stored in the database. Password and salt is just concatenated like this hash(key + password) and run multiple rounds of hashing.

That may be vulnerable for an length extension attack right? 
Would changing the order of values make any prevention of length
extension attacks? So changing hash(key + password) to hash(password + key)?

A better way of hashing the user password seems to be HMAC. In this case using hmac-sha256(password, salt). 

But is this really better and more secure to use HMAC here? 

Some people said it makes no sense to use a salt as a password for HMAC
    but the salt is not visible for the user because it is just stored
    in the database. For me it's nothing other than a password. 
API authentication/validation
For an API all users got a unique and random api_key and an api_secret.
The api_key is sent in all requests by an header to identify the user. That should be a kind of ""stateless authentication"".
The api_secret will be used in backend to generate a signature using hmac-sha256((api_key + nonce), api_secret). 
The nonce is a random value that is send in another header as plain text and as well as a hashed value to verify that the nonce itself won't be manipulated (well not really needed because it will change the whole signature)... so a kind of nonce-signature: 
rand = random();
hash = hmac-sha256(rand, api_secret);
nonce = rand + ""-"" + hash;


But is this really more secure than just make something like hash(api_key + nonce + api_secret) and leave the nonce without any nonce-signature?
Is there any security issue by providing multiple HMAC-hashes at the same time that are hashed with the same api_secret?
Any other toughts about that in point of security?

It's hard for me to understand what the more or less secure ways of creating a secure hash are. Some people said ""ok, this is secure... you should do this"" and then other people said ""oh you forgot this or that attack or vulnerable"". So i try to understand how and why in a simple and ""i-am-a-dummie-way"". 
","SHA-256 is not a great hashing method. Use bcrypt, PBKDF2, or scrypt.
Make your salts the same length and put them first
Peppering (HMAC-ing passwords) is useful if you think you have the chance a SQL injection vulnerability down the road, and a lower chance of an application server vulnerability.
Correct peppering means your application server holds the key and it is not stored in your database. 
If you accidentally have a SQL injection down the road, a hacker might steal all your peppered passwords, but wouldn't be able to steal the key
It sounds like you're going to be doing hashing on every request, which is going to painfully slow. You should hash once and provide a token

","I do not believe this is an acceptable solution. 
The purpose of a HMAC is to verify data integrity and authenticity. So you can use it to verify that the information has not changed and you can use it to verify that the user has the secret key (in your case, the password). 
What it cannot do is some of the other things that SSL can do, like protect from eaves-dropping by encrypting the channel and verifying the identity of the server for the end user.
Eavesdropping: There would be nothing stopping a man-in-the-middle (MITM) from watching this transaction, intercepting the return response (the HMAC digest) and sending it on as his own request (even stopping the response from the other user). 
Verifying the ID of the server: One of the most important parts you are missing here is protecting your users from being duped by a phisher. With a valid SSL cert, your users have no way of verifying if the site is your or an impostor. You are trying to protect yourself by verifying the authenticity of the end-user, which is great, but you are forgetting to protect the end user. 
I'd be curious to know why you don't have SSL available. I hear this a lot and find that the usual reason is becuase someone doesn't want to pony up the $50 for the cert. But the cert is worth it and in an environment where security is important there really should not be any technical reason why SSL would not be available.

","Your problem is the line endings in your text. In reality, your program is generating the correct hash, but you're entering a different string into the web tool, which is why you're getting a different result. Here's the text you're feeding to your program:
(request-line) get /\ndate: Wed, 02 Jul 2014 22:12:37 GMT

And here's what you're feeding to the web tool (assuming you're doing so on Windows, which checks out based on my tests):
(request-line) get /\r\ndate: Wed, 02 Jul 2014 22:12:37 GMT

Note the '\r\n'. By default, Windows (and, most likely, all web browsers) uses a carriage return AND a line feed character as an EOL sequence. Unix/Linux uses only a line feed, and Mac uses only a carriage return.
If you want to check any other hashes, either add a '\r' into your program for testing, or use a program like Notepad++ where you can control the line endings to create files and then upload them to the second site you listed.

However, one things gets me confused with the HawkNet configuration on the server side: all the examples shown on sites and blogs, show a hardcoded handler in the WebApiConfig register method like this:
var handler = new HawkMessageHandler(new HttpControllerDispatcher(config),

            handler: handler
        );

However, in my scenario, the Windows Forms client will be used by different users, on different laptops, and each user needs to be able to ""log in"" from this WinForms app in order to use the web API. If I understand correctly, I need to maintain a ""key"" and ""id"" like above for each user (can do that on the server in the database), and the client must also know this key (I guess the key could be something like hashing the username and password combo, so it can be built in the client and on the server without ever needing to pass it on the wire).
But how do I configure that on the server ? In order words, how do I make those values (username, key and id) in the HawkMessageHandler on the server dynamic ?
Or am I totally missing the point here ?

I couldn't find enough information on the internet.
How do you get the IV? How would you know what it is when you need to decrypt later? (Wouldn't putting it in the database defeat the purpose?)
What is HMAC, and is it protected from hacking?
The encrypted text stays in the database. If someone hacks into the database, they would probably have access to the file manager too, unless they found a way to do SQL injection. How would the script know which IV and key to use, that the hacker wouldn't know?
What is the best method to use when encrypting multiple paragraphs of text, which will only be seen within the website by the user who wrote it? (The user always views it as plain text.)
I use ECB now (the website has not yet been released for beta) but I've heard that CBC is much more secure.
","The main purpose of an IV is to be different for each encryption. It's not secret. It's standard to create a random IV for each encryption, and store it as a prefix of the ciphertext.
HMAC is a MAC, and it ensures that only messages created by somebody who knows the key are accepted as valid. It's important to apply the MAC after encryption and to include the IV. i.e. HMAC(IV+Encrypt(...)), and thus verify it before decryption. This avoids certain attacks, such as padding oracles.
It's also worth a consideration to use an authenticated encryption mode, such as AES-GCM, which combines authentication and encryption in a secure way. Just make damn sure you never reuse an IV in that case.

Where to store the key is a difficult question, and very application dependent. As you noticed, storing the key on the same system as the database does not gain you much.
Sometimes it's a good idea to derive the key from the user's password, using a slow KDF with a salt, such as PBKDF2. Sometimes you can store it on the client. Sometimes you can store it on a different server with smaller attack surface.
To figure out where to store it, you need clear requirements and a threat model.

If someone were to steal the secret, they have the key needed to do basically anything that user is authorized to do.
I was thinking that there must be a more secure alternative.  Are there any flaws with using RSA?

","It depends on the asymmetric cryptosystem you chose:
(EC)Diffie-Hellman: It does not work. Publickey is directly derived from the privatekey via the generator, e.g. [d]G = Q
RSA: Usually people chose fixed publickeys like 0x010001. This is done for efficiency reasons. If you take a large enough, fully random e and derive d from it there is no possibility to calculate p and q given d and N OR e and N. Actually they are pretty equally then and the label private and public don't make much sense anymore. All that relies on a smmyetrical property of RSA. Be sure not to walk into textbook RSA issues. And be sure to ask enough clever people about it, this is just my thoughts on it.

The server and client will have a shared secret, the client will sign the requests, the server will validate, and proceed if all is well.  The trouble with this sort of system is that the secret has to be stored in a way where it can be retrieved, such as a database.  If someone were to steal the secret, they have the key needed to do basically anything that user is authorized to do.
I was thinking that there must be a more secure alternative.  Are there any flaws with using RSA?

","If you base your crypto system on a proof of possession of a secret you need to, well - keep it secret :) 
But yes, if you dont need the speed of a symmetric authentication then you can use a assymetric signature. Typically it is done with a signed hash, but you can also use a signed hmac.
The terminology is normally, that you sign with a secret key and validate with the public key (even when the signing operation looks like an encryption).

","I'd first make sure your code works outside of Lightroom. It seems that HMAC module you referenced has some other dependencies: it requires ""glue"", ""bit"", and ""ffi"" modules. Of these, bit and ffi are binary modules and I'm not sure you will be able to load them into Lightroom (unless they are already available there). In any case, you probably won't be able to make it run in LR if you don't have required modules and can't make it run without issues outside of LR.

Password base key generation:

Random key generation:
KeyGenerator gen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""HmacSHA256"");
Key key = gen.generateKey;

string passowrd = ""password"";
string data = ""data"";
Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA256"");
mac.init(key);
byte[] signature = mac.doFinal(data.getBytes(""UTF-8""));

Do the algorithms in SecretKeySpec or KeyGenerator and Mac need to be matched? I tried with different algorithms like below, but It works.
Key key = new SecretKeySpec(""pass"".getBytes(""UTF-8""), ""HmacSHA1"");
Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA256"");
mac.init(key);
byte[] signature = mac.doFinal(data.getBytes(""UTF-8""));

Also this code below works
KeyGenerator gen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""HmacSHA256"");
gen.init(keysize);
val key = gen.generateKey;
Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA1"");
mac.init(key);
byte[] signature = mac.doFinal(data.getBytes(""UTF-8""));

I'm not sure it proper way or not. Actually when I change the algorithm in KeyGenerator it returns different length of key, but I think it's same if I specify key size as init(int keysize). What if it's same what's the difference between using SecureRandom?
","According to the JCA reference guide, this is a peculiarity of the implementations of certain HMACs.

With some MAC algorithms, the (secret-)key algorithm associated with the (secret-)key object used to initialize the Mac object does not matter (this is the case with the HMAC-MD5 and HMAC-SHA1 implementations of the SunJCE provider). With others, however, the (secret-)key algorithm does matter, and an InvalidKeyException is thrown if a (secret-)key object with an inappropriate (secret-)key algorithm is used.

As to why, I can't say. I can only guess that with SecretKeySpec changing the algorithm doesn't matter because:

This class is only useful for raw secret keys that can be represented as a byte array and have no key parameters associated with them, e.g., DES or Triple DES keys.

The idea is to give the client all the necessary data, let the user interact with that data in a snappy Javascript application (currently GWT, but we are considering moving to Angular or Backbone). We would like to make the server completely stateless, which improves scalability and memory usage.
A fundamental problem of course is that there is some data a user is not allowed to alter. For example, when doing a password reset procedure, the user cannot change his username, because then he could alter somebody elses password. There is also a boolean that indicates if the user has passed the captcha, we cannot allow him to set that to true. And many other examples can be thought of.
The solution we thought of is the following: Together with these strings that a user cannot touch (we call them the priviledged information), we also add a signature. This is simply the concatenation of the priviledeg info, HMAC signed on the server with an AES key. When the data from the client returns we concatenate and sign the info again, and if the signatures are identical, we know that the client has not touched our info.
My questions: Does anybody see any weaknesses in this scheme, and can anybody point to resources (books, blogs) where more info about this subject can be found?

From what I understand, the hmac() function returns the results in hexadecimal format. binaryEncode() expects a binary value, so thehmac() results must be first converted from hex to binary, before it can be converted to base64.
<cfset string = ""1234567890"" />
<cfset secretKey = ""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"" />
<!--- Get Hex results from HMAC() --->
<cfset hmacHex = hmac(string,secretKey,'HMACSHA256') />
<!--- Decode the binary value from hex --->
<cfset hmacAsBinary = binaryDecode(hmacHex,'hex') />
<!--- Convert binary object to Base64 --->
<cfset hmacBase64 = binaryEncode(hmacAsBinary, 'base64') />
<cfoutput>
    <!--- incorrect hmac signature --->
    hmacBase64: #hmacBase64#<br>
    <!--- correct hmac signature --->
    toBase64: #toBase64(hmac(string,secretKey,'HMACSHA256'))#<br>
</cfoutput>

The results are: 
hmacBase64: VEVGNnqg9b0eURaDCsA4yIOz5c+QtoJqIPInEZOuRm4=
toBase64: NTQ0NTQ2MzY3QUEwRjVCRDFFNTExNjgzMEFDMDM4Qzg4M0IzRTVDRjkwQjY4MjZBMjBGMjI3MTE5M0FFNDY2RQ==

One thing I noticed is the results are much longer when using toBase64(). I can't seem to figure out why I can't use binaryEncode(). However, I would like to, since toBase64() is being deprecated. Any insight is much appreciated. Thanks!
","Update based on comments:
Well using ToBase64(Hmac(...)) is not the correct way to convert a hex string to base64 ;-) However, it sounds like the API requires something other than a straight conversion.  If so, just do what the ToBase64(hmac(...)) code is doing. ie Decode the hex string as UTF8 and re-encode it as base64: 
matchingResult = binaryEncode(charsetDecode(hmacHex, ""utf-8""), ""base64"")

Short answer:
The two methods are encoding totally different values. That is why the results do not match. The correct way to convert the hex string to base64 is using BinaryEncode/Decode().
Longer answer:

<!--- correct hmac signature --->
toBase64: #toBase64(hmac(string,secretKey,'HMACSHA256'))#<br>

Actually that is not the correct way to convert hex to base64. 
Hexadecimal and Base64 are just different ways of representing a binary value. In order to get the same results, the two methods need to start with the same binary. In this case, are actually encoding totally different values. Hence the difference in the results. 
With a hexadecimal string, each byte is represented by two characters. So the binary will be half the size of the original string. In the case of HMAC(HMACSHA256), the resulting hex string is 64 characters long. So the binary value should be 32 bytes. To obtain the correct binary value, the string must be decoded as hex:
original string length = #len(hmacHex)#
binary size = #arrayLen(binaryDecode(hmacHex, ""hex""))#

The problem with ToBase64 is that it decodes the string incorrectly. It treats the input as UTF8 and decodes the characters in the string individually. So the binary value is double the size it should be. Notice it is 64 bytes, instead of 32? That is why the final string is longer as well. 
UTF8 binary size = #arrayLen(charsetDecode(hmacHex, ""utf-8""))# 
ToBase64 binary size = #arrayLen(binaryDecode(toBase64(hmacHex), ""base64""))#

So again, the two methods produce different results because they are encoding totally different values. However, strictly speaking, only the first method is correct. To re-encode a hex string as base64 use binaryEncode/binaryDecode: 
correctResult = binaryEncode(binaryDecode(hmacHex, ""hex""), ""base64"")

I did some research and found two functions that seem to be connected to PBKDF2 and HMAC:

hash_pbkdf2 - http://php.net/manual/en/function.hash-pbkdf2.php
hash_hmac - http://php.net/manual/en/function.hash-hmac.php

What PHP functions should I use? Is it even possible with native PHP functions?
Edit #1
My Java code, the same result I need achieve in PHP
public static byte[] derivateKey(char[] password, byte[] salt, int iterations, int keyLengthBits) {
        try {
            SecretKeyFactory skf = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256"");
            PBEKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password, salt, iterations, keyLengthBits);
            SecretKey key = skf.generateSecret(spec);
            byte[] res = key.getEncoded();
            return res;

        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException | InvalidKeySpecException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException(""Could not create hash"", e);
        }
    }

","The Java code you've provided is basically hash_pbkdf2(). You just need to pass the correct params:
function derivateKey($password, $salt, $iterations, $keyLengthBits)
{
    return hash_pbkdf2(
        'sha256',
        $password,
        $salt,
        $iterations,
        $keyLengthBits / 8,
        true
    );
}

Obviously, PHP's hash_pbkdf2() accepts the hash algorithm as a parameter, but the potentially tricky differences are these:

It doesn't comply with RFC 2898 in that its length is applied after hex-encoding, so that last parameter must be set to true to make it consistent with the spec.
It accepts the output length in bytes instead of bits (hence why we divide by 8 above).

The only thing I'm not sure about is what key.getEncoded() does in your sample code ... there's no encoding algorithm specified anywhere.
I found some docs suggesting it is supposed to be RAW, so the example I'm providing should match it. If it doesn't, you'll have to encode it yourself.

Using SHA256 on the following input I get the correct output:

                    '/\n'+
                    'Action=ListUsers&Version=2010-05-08\n'+

                    '\n'+
                    'content-type;host;x-amz-date\n'+
                    'e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855';

So SHA256 is working properly on that. Similarly, using the Hmac-SHA256 on the following input I get the correct response:
var kDate = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(""20150830"", ""AWS4wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"");
var kRegion = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256('us-east-1', kDate);
var kService = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256('iam', kRegion);
var kSigning = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(""aws4_request"", kService);

console.log(kSigning.toString()); //returns the expected value of c4afb1cc5771d871763a393e44b703571b55cc28424d1a5e86da6ed3c154a4b9

So this Hmac-SHA256 function works correctly on this input. However, on the following input, Hmac-SHA256 DOES NOT return the expected output.
var stringToSign = 'AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\n'+
                '20150830T123600Z\n'+
                '20150830/us-east-1/iam/aws4_request\n'+
                CryptoJS.SHA256(canonString).toString();

CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(kSigning.toString(), stringToSign); //Returns 8a96b6691875490d30d05731cc9aa26be1fd64cf611ed929753b6498075aa886

//Trying in opposite order just in case

So, something is clearly going wrong with my stringToSign, and I don't know what it is. I was thinking that the newline character is being interpreted as two different characters and not just a single character. However, escaping it like '\\n' did not fix it either! I am at a loss here. Here are the two docs I've been following (doc1 doc2). Does anyone know why I can't get the expected output?
","Remember that the sha256 digest is a byte sequence: it is not a ""normal string"". It looks like CryptoJS is converting the true sha256 digest to something else for convenience, so make it not do that and you're good to go.
Using Node's crypto library (which is a built-in API) rather than CryptoJS (which has absolutely terrible documentation, so using it is kind of questionable):
const crypto = require(""crypto"");

function HMAC(key, text) {
    return crypto.createHmac(""sha256"", key).update(text).digest();
}

And then we form the canonical hash:
const canonString = [
    'GET',
    '/',
    'Action=ListUsers&Version=2010-05-08',
    'content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8',
    'host:iam.amazonaws.com',
    'x-amz-date:20150830T123600Z',
    '',
    'content-type;host;x-amz-date',
    'e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855'
].join('\n');

// note: plain hash, not a secret-key-seeded hash
const canonHash = crypto.createHash(""sha256"").update(canonString).digest();
console.log(""Canonical hash is   :"", canonHash.toString('hex'));

This yields f536975d06c0309214f805bb90ccff089219ecd68b2577efef23edd43b7e1a59. We then continue:
const kSecret = ""wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"";
const kDate = HMAC(""AWS4"" + kSecret,""20150830"");
const kRegion = HMAC(kDate,""us-east-1"");
const kService = HMAC(kRegion,""iam"");
const kSigning = HMAC(kService,""aws4_request"");
console.log(""kSigning hash is    :"", kSigning.toString('hex'));

Which yields c4afb1cc5771d871763a393e44b703571b55cc28424d1a5e86da6ed3c154a4b9: note that we do not do any hex conversion, because the hex digest is not the sha256 digest, it's a completely different string. We only convert to hex string to make the digest legible in the console log.
Then finally:
const stringToSign = [
    'AWS4-HMAC-SHA256',
    '20150830T123600Z',
    '20150830/us-east-1/iam/aws4_request',
    canonHash.toString('hex')
].join('\n');

const signed = HMAC(kSigning, stringToSign);
console.log(""Final signed hash is:"", signed.toString('hex'));

Which yields 5d672d79c15b13162d9279b0855cfba6789a8edb4c82c400e06b5924a6f2b5d7. Note that here, we had to turn the canonical hash into a hexadecimal string, as per the instructions in the pages you link to, but we do not touch the kSigning digest, that has to stay a real sha256 byte string.

  return Enumerable
    .Range(0, hexString.Length/2)
    .Select(i => (Byte) Int32.Parse(hexString.Substring(2*i, 2), NumberStyles.HexNumber))

But my javacard framework version is 2.2.1 so Signature class does not include this method for this version.

","You could always just use the value that you find in the 2.2.2 framework for the constant ALG_HMAC_SHA1 (= (byte)24) and pass it to the Signature.getInstance() method. So using the value is not a problem. However, the smartcard hardware on which you want to run your applet needs to support this algorithm in order for you to be able to use.
So if your smartcard hardware supports JC 2.2.1, calling the getInstance() method with the value of ALG_HMAC_SHA1 will typically cause a CryptoException with reason (CryptoException.NO_SUCH_ALGORITHM) indicating that the algorithm is not supported and JC 2.2.1 does not support any HMAC algorithms). Using the public constant directly will likely result in upload or installation failure.
Just to be clear here, I'm not suggesting that compiling for a different framework version might suddenly solve your problem. I'm rather suggesting that you can not simply upgrade the functionality that is available on your card.

"9672910","Allowing any data to be decrypted using AES 256 for the purposes of HMAC","Consider a file that will be encrypted by a C# library that I will write, consisting of a 64 byte HMAC followed immediately by the encrypted data encrypted with AES 256. The 16-byte IV,  32-byte Key and 64-byte HMACSHA512 initialisation key will come from Rfc2898DeriveBytes via a single string password, entered by the user (4096 iterations, and a single salt from random.org).

Are there any negative security implications of this design?
Have I gone overboard? (it, with the 64-byte initialisation key or 4096 iterations)
I want to be able to decrypt any data whatsoever in order to use the embedded HMAC to verify that the password was correct (that is, that the 'decrypted file is the original file'). Specifically, I'm looking to avoid errors such as ""Padding is invalid and cannot be removed."". Any ideas on how to go about this?

","
Yes, the IV should be prepended to the cipher text and should be random. If you use Rfc2898DeriveBytes you will get the same IV each time, so encrypting different plain texts will result in identical cipher texts, leaking information.
Yes, the 64 byte initialization key is a bit much. 16 to 32 bytes should be more than enough. That said, it does not make much difference regarding performance, so... 4Ki iterations is fine (why not just 4000, the algorithm does not change).
Yes, place the HMAC over the encrypted data, and make sure you verify the HMAC before you decrypt (the last block). Normally the HMAC is placed after the cipher text (as a streaming implementation will only know the HMAC once it encrypted all the cipher text).

Alternatively you could use AES in GCM mode so you don't need the HMAC anymore. GCM (or EAX) mode is not always available though.

The transaction consists of an external uuid, an email, and some additional meta properties. This message is signed with an HMAC sha256 digest, using our partner's private API key.
Ruby example:
data = {

Within the third-party webpage, the javascript client is then initialized with the signature and the data:
new Client(signature, data).execute();
Initially, our plan was to allow the client to create a partial / incomplete transaction within our system and then require a subsequent back-end request via our REST API to confirm / finalize the transaction. Assuming that we can secure the front-end, however, it would be preferential to remove the back-end confirmation requirement.
Can we reasonably secure the client code using signed messages in this fashion? If the data and the signed message is available in the client, how difficult would it be for a bad actor to brute force the API private key length, given the length above?
","most internet traffic has signed tokens on the client these days.  All your gmail logins, facebook logins, etc do this so it is fairly standard.  I'd recommend using an existing standard (and 3rd party library) rather than roll your own token though.  This will let you leverage other people's expertise in this area.

Why not just go like:

This is assuming that JSON_REQUEST_CONTENT is a JSON string that contains all of the relevant request information.
It seems to me like adding the HTTP VERB and URI (or whatever extra non-content-specific info) is just adding to the length of the message, and I don't understand the benefit.
Thanks!
","HMACs are generally used to prevent message tampering, but they are also used to prevent replay of messages.
If the HMAC only included the payload and a secret that would only prevent tampering, if I sent the same message again it would be valid. By garnishing the request with other details (datetime or a nonce especially) that should prevent replay as well as tampering.

To use the datetime as salt for the hash, you generally will need to send the datetime with the message in clear text (although it could be roughly inferred from the time the message was received or sent in the request headers external to the payload). If the datetime is too far from what the server believes the time to be, the message will fail (e.g. not within a minute). If when the server does the same hash on the data and it doesn't get the same result, it will also fail the message.
To use a nonce, the most practical way is for the service to say, next time you send me a request, use this nonce. The nonce doesn't need to be sent in clear text with the request. When the server processes a message successfully, it says, next time use this nonce and the previous one becomes invalid.
Datetime prevents replay by ensuring that a message was sent at a specific time, a nonce prevents replay by using a single use password.

    post_data = urllib.urlencode(args)
    print post_data
    sign = hmac.new(secret, post_data, hashlib.sha512).hexdigest()
    print sign
    headers = {

    ret = urllib2.urlopen(urllib2.Request('https://poloniex.com/tradingApi', post_data, headers))

CallPrivate(""returnBalances"", nil)

Right now I am stuck calling out to the python implementation which is not a pretty solution.
","Python dict is an unordered mapping type.
>>> args = {}
>>> args['command'] = 'command'
>>> args['nonce'] = 10000
>>> list(args)
['nonce', 'command']  # <--- Iterating dictionary will yield in different order
                      #      with item insertion order

urllib.urlencode not only accepts a dictinoary, but it also accept a sequence of key-value-pair sequences. You can use it to guarantee the order of output:
>>> import urllib
>>> urllib.urlencode({'command': 'command', 'nonce': 10000})
'nonce=10000&command=command'
>>> urllib.urlencode([('command', 'command'), ('nonce', 10000)])
'command=command&nonce=10000'

Alternatively, instead of dict ({}), you can use collections.OrderedDict which remembers key insertion order.
UPDATE
In the Go code, command post data is set with method instead of command parameter.
v.Set(""command"", method)
                 ^^^^^^

UPDATE2
Python code uses the hex string secret as is:
sign = hmac.new(secret, post_data, hashlib.sha512).hexdigest()

while the Go code decode it before use it:
secret_bytes, _ := hex.DecodeString(privkey)
sighash := hmac.New(sha512.New, secret_bytes)

Do the same way as the Python code:
sighash := hmac.New(sha512.New, []byte(privkey))

UPDATE3

Go code does json marshal for post_data, but Python code does not.
You need to set header in Go code: ""Content-Type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded""


Here's the modified Go code that will work:
func CallPrivate(method string, args map[string]string) {
    if args == nil {
        args = make(map[string]string)
    }
    v := make(url.Values)
    v.Set(""nonce"", ""3000000000"") //strconv.Itoa(int((time.Now().Unix()))*1000))
    v.Set(""command"", method)
    for k, val := range args {
        v.Set(k, val)
    }
    final_url := private_api_url
    post_data := v.Encode()
    sighash := hmac.New(sha512.New, []byte(privkey))
    sighash.Write([]byte(post_data))
    sigstr := hex.EncodeToString(sighash.Sum(nil))

    client := &http.Client{}
    buf := bytes.NewBuffer([]byte(post_data))
    req, _ := http.NewRequest(""POST"", final_url, buf)
    req.Header.Set(""Key"", pubkey)
    req.Header.Set(""Sign"", sigstr)
    req.Header.Set(""Content-Type"", ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"")
    res, _ := client.Do(req)
    defer res.Body.Close()

    res_body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)
    log.Printf(""%s"", string(res_body))

What I want to do is provide a private key, hash some data with it and send the hash in a header, then rehash the same data again on the server for comparison.
What I'm having trouble with it is, what kind of data should I hash, the request URI, the content type and maybe the content itself, but what when the request is GET and there is no content.
Will hashing any data with the private key will be secure enough, or do I need to do something special?
","
As stated in the comment, you don't want public/private key pairs here. What you want is a proof of identity. The client will give you their username/id (they'll claim an identity), and you need additional proof that it's really them. For this purpose they send a secret which only they are supposed to know. That's a simple token.
You want to avoid sending this token over the wire back and forth. Remember it's a secret and should stay as secret as possible. Instead what you ask the client to send is an indirect proof; you ask them to sign the request.
Signing a request means they simply hash the contents of the request with a MAC algorithm, their secret token being the key to the hash.

What parts of the request to hash you decide; everything that's included in the hash is unspoofable by 3rd parties, but you should refrain from requiring everything to be hashed since HTTP headers may be added or removed at various stages of the request.
To avoid replay attacks, hash the date of the request (and require the date be sent with the request). Don't accept requests past a certain expiry date. Alternatively include an ever changing token, if that's feasible.
Make sure the hash is easily reproducible, e.g. require sorting of the data to be hashed.
You should include the URL in the hash; if you do, it doesn't matter whether there's body data or not. The URL + the date/token from above is perfectly sufficient already to form a MAC.

","There's something about the discipline of isolating a problem and writing an explanation for the tough but fair crowd that is stackoverflow that often seems to shake out a solution all by itself. 
So with apologies for this 'asked & answered'. I'm just relieved to have a solution.
A little bit of further experimentation yielded these insights:

forcing the argument to be a separate object via 


secret = new String(...)

caused a failure inside of node's crypto library: 

TypeError: not a buffer.

This is a clue!

after converting the user input to a Buffer before passing it as the secret to createHmac results in consistent behaviour between the 2 calls.

","Somehow your requirement and what we are implementing in our project looks same except different platform, ours is .net.
Follow the same process for login resource with username and password. Once you decide on the mechanism you want to sign this token its not mandatory that it is always appended in the url. 

Instead of sending the token in the URL try it with the authorization header of http protocol. Use Authorization  = ""Authorization"" "":"" credentials Ref

This way you can keep your url same but based on the authentication you can serve resources.

You can store this token in cookie for subsequent requests.
Removing token from url solves your 3rd doubt.

Hope this helps you up to some extent.

","The main problem is that hash_hmac returns a hex string, while :crypto.hmac returns a binary.

We need to use String.downcase because Base.encode16 returns a hex string with capital A-F while PHP's hash_hmac returns lower case a-f.

The python code below produces the correct signature. The java code using the same key, salt, produces something different and I am at a loss for why. In the Java code I am using the key generated in python (_key) to create the signature. 
What I don't understand is, if I print the value of _key in python I get ""34ee7983-5ee6-4147-aa86-443ea062abf774493d6a-2a15-43fe-aace-e78566927585"". Now if I take that and place it directly into the hmac(new) call I get a different result than if I just leave the _key variable. I assume this has something to do with encoding of some type but I am at a loss.

"54458572","Invalid sign error on okex api v3 authenticated request","I try to send authenticated request to new okex api.
part of their documentation:
Creating a Request
All REST requests must contain the following headers:
OK-ACCESS-KEY The api key as a string.
OK-ACCESS-SIGN The base64-encoded signature (see Signing a Message).
OK-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP A timestamp for your request.
OK-ACCESS-PASSPHRASE The passphrase you specified when creating the API key.
All request bodies should have content type application/json and be valid JSON.
Signing a Message
The OK-ACCESS-SIGN header is generated by creating a sha256 HMAC using the base64-decoded secret key on the prehash string timestamp + method + requestPath + body (where + represents string concatenation), secretKey and base64-encode the output. For example: sign=CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(timestamp + 'GET' + '/users/self/verify', secretKey))
The timestamp value is the same as the OK-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP header and nanometer precision.
The method should be UPPER CASE, like GET/POST.
requestPath is the path of requesting an endpoint, such as：/orders?before=2&limit=30.
The body is the request body string or omitted if there is no request body (typically for GET requests). For example:{""product_id"":""BTC-USD-0309"",""order_id"":""377454671037440""}
secretKey is generated when a user is subscribing to an Apikey. Prehash string:2018-03-08T10:59:25.789ZPOST/orders?before=2&limit=30{""product_id"":""BTC-USD-0309"",""order_id"":""377454671037440""}

","""... using the base64-decoded secret key ...""
I faced the same problem. After having examined their examples I found out the secret key does not need to be base64-decoded. Maybe we should assume we are already given a base64-decoded key. Anyway, as soon as you stop base64-decoding the secret key your signature generator should start working. Mine did.

"7086825","Can a python script decrypt a HASH that was created in a C++ program?","I have a competition that people can enter with a secret code they discover in an Android app. The method I have chosen to ensure only people who have purchased the app can enter the competition is to use shared secret encoded(encrypted?) with HMAC SHA256.
So my secret will be encrypted in C in the Android app (using Crypto++, do you have any suggestions of a beter SHA library? I am finding Crypto++ really hard to use).
This is just an example:
Unencrypted shared secret = ""my shared secret""  
Unencrypted secret code   = ""abcdef""  
Encrypted shared secret   = ""dsgdfgdfgdfgfdgf""   
Encrypted shared secret   = ""ddffgdgdf""

So when the user discovers the secret code they will be taken to a webpage(python script) & the HMAC encrypted shared secret will be passed as a CGI parameter:
http://mysite/competition.py?encodedSecret=3dfdfdg343jkfjk390kl
Then my python script will look at the CGI parameter & decrypt it to get the shared secret(to verify that the competition entry is from a user who has the app) & the secret code(to see if the user has won anything).
My Question is: Is it possible for a python script(using hashlib module) to decrypt something that was encrypted in C using Crypto++?
","When using a hash that way, normally you would pass the secret code (in plaintext) and the hash of both the secret code and the shared secret to your web site. The web site can then perform the same hash (as it knows the shared secret), and verify that the result is the same.
'Cracking' the hash on your server is a lot of extra work, and I don't see how it adds any security.
If you must not transmit the code in plaintext, it would be much more efficient to use your shared secret as the key in a symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g. AES).

","Updated Answer
Uber considered the insertion of backslashes into webhook bodies a bug and released a fix. The workaround below will now break comparisons. As of 4/28/2016, clients written in Node should just perform the comparison without modifying the webhook body. Clients in languages that don't share Node's behavior of ignoring blackslashes in escape sequences are unaffected.
Original Answer
JS ignores the backslash when reading escape sequences in a string. The missing backslash is breaking your comparison because it's included in webhook event signatures.
An immediate workaround is to re-insert those backslashes using a regex.
var reconstitutedWebhookBody = input.replace(/\//g, '\\' + '/');
That regex will need to be extended if webhooks ever start including other escapable characters.

"46826855","adyen HPP integration","I am trying to integrate the adyen hpp pages. I basically use the same code like in their example on github: https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-java-sample-code/blob/master/src/com/adyen/examples/hpp/CreatePaymentOnHpp_SHA_256.java
on that example I just set the merchantAccount, skinCode adn the hmac secret code to my data.
Additionally I added some code to create a test url for the hmac calculation:
        String queryString = params.keySet().stream()
            .map(key -> {
                try {
                    return key + ""="" +  URLEncoder.encode(params.get(key), ""UTF-8"");
                } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                return ""Error: could not URL-encode value"";
            }).collect(Collectors.joining(""&""));

        String testUrl = ""https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/skin/checkhmac.shtml"" + ""?"" + queryString;

        System.out.println(testUrl);

I also created some code to create an url for the hpp. It looks like this:
        URIBuilder b = new URIBuilder(hppUrl);
        for (Map.Entry<String, String> entry : params.entrySet()) {
            b.addParameter(entry.getKey(), URLEncoder.encode(entry.getValue(), ""UTF-8""));
        }

        return b.build().toString();

So the calculation of the HMAC seems to be correct, because the testUrl is always correct.
But if I click on the generated link for the hpp, then I always get an error that I should check the HMAC calculation.
I hope someone can give me a hint on how to fix it
","The URIBuilder already URL-encodes the parameters for you by default. The implementation you posted encodes your parameters twice, causing parameters such as your merchantReference to be different from the signing string that was used to calculate your merchant signature.
The following code would fix the issue and create a valid HPP link:
URIBuilder b = new URIBuilder(hppUrl);
params.entrySet().forEach(e-> b.addParameter(e.getKey(),e.getValue()));
System.out.println(b.build().toString());

"35840228","PHP -- calculating correct HMAC signature as nodejs script","So I am working on a PHP script that queries an API which uses HMAC authentication headers. However, I have been banging my head trying to encode the HMAC signature correctly. I have a preexisting nodejs script to work from as a template. 
In the nodejs script, the HMAC signature is calculated using the following:
var crypto = require('crypto');
var hmac = [];
hmac.secret = 'ODc0YTM3YzUxODFlMWQ1YTdhMGQwY2NiZmE1N2Y1ODdjYzM5NTgyMDJhZjVkYTE4MmQxYzQ5ODk0M2QzNWQxYw==';
hmac.timestamp = 1457326475000;
hmac.path = '/account/';
hmac.message = hmac.path +'\n' + hmac.timestamp;
var sig = crypto.createHmac('sha512', new Buffer(hmac.secret, 'base64'));
hmac.signature = sig.update(hmac.message).digest('base64');

console.log(hmac);

This correctly calculates the HMAC signature as:
bWjIFFtFmWnj0+xHLW2uWVa6M6DpbIV81uyUWwRFCJUg+0Xyt40QWZWQjGvfPUB/JbjGZHUoso0Qv5JHMYEv3A==.
Meanwhile, in PHP, I am using:
<?php
$hmac['secret'] = 'ODc0YTM3YzUxODFlMWQ1YTdhMGQwY2NiZmE1N2Y1ODdjYzM5NTgyMDJhZjVkYTE4MmQxYzQ5ODk0M2QzNWQxYw==';
$hmac['nonce'] = '1457326475000';
$hmac['path'] = '/account/';
$hmac['message'] = $hmac['path'].""\n"".$hmac['nonce'] ;
$hmac['signature'] = base64_encode(hash_hmac('sha512',$hmac['message'],
$hmac['secret'], true));

print_r($hmac);

The above code, will calculate the HMAC signature as:
vqP49m/bk9nA4S3nMqW2r+kc2+yBfwhY/jWGUfz6dlKJUMkC2ktiPnuCcymdSWl4XezZT5VKCATYfus86Hz/Gg==
Working from the principle that ""one million monkeys hacking away at a million keyboards""  might one day be able to encode a valid HMAC signature, I have even tested a loop that iterates through all the permutations of the above PHP code (with/without base64 encoding the message, secret; with/without binary encoding of the HMAC, etc.)... to no avail.
Any suggestions for this here, one exhausted simian?
","The problem is that you're not decoding your $hmac['secret'] first before passing it to hash_hmac().
Try:
$hmac['secret'] = base64_decode($hmac['secret']);
$hmac['signature'] = base64_encode(
  hash_hmac('sha512', $hmac['message'], $hmac['secret'], true)
);

"45283263","Generating HMAC signature with hashed ""password""","I am playing around with authentication methods in my RESTful API project and I really like the idea of generating HMAC-SHA256 signatures as an authentication method.
The client is creating the signature with few simple steps:
# example client-side code
sig = hmac.new(bytes('SUPER_SECRET_KEY', 'utf-8'), b'', sha256)
sig.update(request_path)
sig.update(request_body)
# ...other variables needed for generating the signature...

signature = sig.hexdigest()

and adding it to request header along with his ""user name"" (e.g. Authorization: THE_USER_NAME:abcd1234xyz890).
On server-side, I am trying to re-create it in the same way:
# example server-side code
def do_check(request):
    # get user name from request header
    username = request.headers['Authorization'].split(':')[0]

    # some method to retrieve the ""secret key"" from database
    user = db.User().filter(username=username).one()

    # use user's ""secret key"" to generate the signature
    sig = hmac.new(bytes(user.key, 'utf8'), b'', sha256)
    sig.update(bytes(request.path, 'utf-8'))
    sig.update(request.data)
    # ...other variables needed for generating the signature...

    return sig.hexdigest()
    # compare the returned signature with the one client sent us...

All this works fine as long as I store the user's key as a plain text in my database:
| username      | key              |
------------------------------------
| THE_USER_NAME | SUPER_SECRET_KEY |

We all are aware that this is absolutely unacceptable, so I tried to simply hash the SUPER_SECRET_KEY with bcrypt and storing a hashed string instead:
| username      | key                                                          |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| THE_USER_NAME | $2b$12$UOIKEBFBedbcYFhbXBclJOZIEgSGaFmeZYhQtaE4l6WobFW1qvIf6 |

The problem I am facing now is that client used un-hashed version of the ""secret key"" to generate the signature which I am unable to do on server-side since I don't have it in plain-text anymore.
One of the examples of a similar approach is generating HMAC signature in Amazon Web Services (also simplified explanation of the same process) which does not require any additional log-ins or authentication, nor does provide any tokens or ""replacements"" for the key/secret combination. I really doubt that AWS is storing the secret in a plain text in database(?)
How can I recreate the HMAC signature on server-side with hashed version of ""secret key"" in database, while not forcing the client-side to change its method of signature generating (e.g. avoid installing bcrypt or even hashing the secret at all)?
","Password hashing does not use a shared secret. The act of hashing the secret is supposed to destroy the actual value, while retaining the ability to authenticate a password. You can't reasonably be expected to recover the password from the hash. 
Hmac authentication and validation uses a shared secret. Both parties must know this secret. 
For this reason, password hashing is fundamentally different from hmac, and you can't simply hash the hmac key. The hash will not allow you to ever get back to the actual key.
[deleted irrelevant sections after clarification]
So you have to have some kind of secret somewhere, but it does not need to be in the database. The actual hmac shared secret can be encrypted in the database using a symmetric cipher (using a different key that is not in the database). Thus the server reads the encrypted hmac secret key, decrypts it, and uses that.  
The important thing is you have to encrypt it in some way that you can decrypt, and that rules out hashing.

Invalid HMAC

I need to ignore this server warning.
For example with curl command I use the -k option. Can I do the same with phplibsec?

-k, --insecure (SSL) This option explicitly allows curl to perform ""insecure"" SSL connections and transfers. All SSL connections are
  attempted to be made secure by using the CA certificate bundle
  installed by default. This makes all connections considered ""insecure""
  fail unless -k, --insecure is used.

","The ""Invalid HMAC"" is not a warning, it's a fatal error. You cannot suppress it.
The error indicates there's some misunderstanding in communication between the server and the phpseclib client.

The error has nothing to do with the ""host key verification"". Contrary to majority of SSH clients, the phpseclib does not actually even verify the host key. You have code this yourself.
See http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/ssh/2.0/examples.html#oneoff,hostkey

","We had a similar issue which turned out to be related to the time stamp of the client vs. the server.
Solved it (server-side) by checking that the request was within the allowed time this way:
(a > b ? a-b : b-a) > maxtime vs a - b > maxtime
If b > a, being an unsigned long (ulong), the value went to a huge value, thus triggering an invalid request condition.

I am hoping someone here will be able to shed some light on my question. Consider the following Example AWS S3 URL:
https://some-bucket.s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/images/some_image.jpg?X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Date=20170920T124015Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAI6CJYFYSSWMXXXXX/20170920/eu-west-2/s3/aws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=0481296b70633de9efb2fce6e20751df2f55fd79b5ff9570c02ff8f587dce825
In my specific example, the above URL is a request to view an image on S3 which I am exposing directly in a HTML img tag, and the user in Amz-Credential has both read and write permissions. The URL is also set to expire in 10 minutes. 
Is is safe to link to the image directly via this URL, or is there any possibility that within these 10 minutes, the signature from this URL could be used in a maliciously crafted REST request to delete or modify the image instead of viewing it?
I do suspect a different action will have a different signature to make this impossible, but given my very limited understanding of AWS auth, I thought it better to ask just in case.
I know I could create a read-only user (extra complexity) or hide the S3 URL behind a controller action on my own web app (requires 2 total requests to load each image, making it inefficient), but I would rather learn whether my current approach is safe or not before resorting to either of these.
Thank you kindly for your time. :)
","If your pre-signed url has PUT or DELETE permission someone could try to get the Signature + AccessKeyId to overwrite or delete your object.
Just make sure that you are signing the url with a read-only permission and I guess you're good.

","The reason the php and python signatures did not match had nothing to do with their calculate_signature() methods.
The issue was caused by differing expires variables. Php used strtotime(""+60 mins"") which resulted in a UTC time 60 minutes from now. Whereas Python used datetime.date.now() + timedelta(minutes=60). This is also 60 minutes from now, but in your current timezone.
I always want to calculate the expire variable in UTC so I replaced my Python calculation with datetime.datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=60).

I want users to be authenticated for a distinct page when they login with an action link in their email. After verify the key gets deleted from the database.
A couple of questions

is this what I need to send in the email and do I need to randomize the secret also
do I store the hash and keep the secret in a constant
compare the hash-received with the database and
second compare the associated userid with the decoded userid
what length does the db field need to be
$hmac = echo hash_hmac('sha256', 'userid|timestamp|somedata', 'tfjtfkmg');

do I verify the email like with the example code from facebook, although facebook uses two hmacs, one for sig and one for payload and base64 it.

function base64_url_decode($input) {

","First of all; there is no such thing as a shared secret when generating a hash.
I quote

Hash functions are primarily used to generate fixed-length output data that acts as a shortened reference to the original data. This is useful when the original data is too cumbersome to use in its entirety.

And I quote again

The shared secret can be used for authentication (for instance when logging into a remote system) [...]  or it can be fed to a key derivation function to produce one or more keys to use for encryption

So basically a hash algorithm has a lot of uses, and generating a protected link wasn't the original meaning, but a good use though!
And a shared secret (or public key) is (most commonly) used to generate an encrypted version of a file (or message) that can only be decrypted by the creator of the shared secret using his private secret (private key). Sorry, can't be too extensive, as there is way too much to tell about the subject :) if you want to know more, start with reading the sources of the quotes above.

Back to your question now. The first question you'll have to ask yourself when encrypting something is how bad does someone want the encrypted info (or wants to get in in your case). In encryption there is no such thing as 'unbreakable', but the best encryption algorithms take such a long time to crack that people don't even try.
In your case, just make sure it is pretty hard to 'guess' the hash (more precise; guess the parameters used to create it). You can, for example, use the time in milliseconds, a random salt, etc. But make sure every parameter you use can be retrieved later on, eg. by storing it in a database next to the generated hash itself. In example storing a users IP isn't useful here, as the user can request the login hash at his office, go back home, and click on the link there. Then suddenly the link wouldn't be valid anymore as his IP 'changed'.
Long story short, an answer on your questions: basically you'll have to send a string (hash) that can only be reproduced by yourself. For that you - and you only - need to know what kind of parameters where used for creating the hash. So every single parameter needs to be stored in the database or can be reproduced in another way.
So yes, I would advise you the randomize the secret for each link, but remember to store it, eg. next to the hash itself in your database. 
The hash you receive should be compared with the one in the database, preferably checking the expiry date/time as well (just store {generation time} + 3600 seconds in your database and compare it against the time the user trys to login your system. In/decrease the 3600 seconds to increase/decrease the time window in which the user can login using the link.
Your last question (compare the associated user id) isn't relevant, as you cannot decode a hash.
The length of a database field depends. For a sha2 you'll need 64 characters, for md5 32 characters, and there are others.

AMX Authorization Header in order to connect to an external API. The C# code works when trying to connect to the external API but when I convert it to a nodeJS solution it doesnt work.
I dont have access to the external C# API so can't update that side but was hoping someone could look at this and see something Im missing or doing wrong:
My nodejs solution: 
var request = require('request');
var uuid = require('node-uuid');
var CryptoJS = require('crypto-js');

var URL = ""https://urltoexternalAPI.com"";
var itemAPPId = ""testAPPId"";
var APIKey = ""testAPIKey"";

var requestUri = encodeURIComponent(URL.toLowerCase());
var requestHttpMethod = ""GET"";

var requestTimeStamp = Math.floor(new Date().getTime() / 1000).toString();

var nonce = uuid.v1().replace(/-/g, '');

//I excluded the content hashing part as the API Im hitting is a GET request with no body content
var signatureRawData = itemAPPId + requestHttpMethod + requestUri + requestTimeStamp + nonce;

var secretKeyByteArray = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(APIKey);

var signature = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(signatureRawData);

var signatureBytes = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(signature, secretKeyByteArray);

var requestSignatureBase64String = signatureBytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);

request({
  url: URL,
  headers: {
    'Authorization': ""amx ""+itemAPPId+"":""+requestSignatureBase64String+"":""+nonce+"":""+requestTimeStamp
  }
}, function (error, response, body) {
  if (response.statusCode != 200) {
    console.log(""Fail"");
  } else {
    console.log(""Success"");
  }
});

","I figured it out! If anyone ever comes across this issue they may find the below helpful:
the following C# code works a little different to nodeJS:
  System.Web.HttpUtility.UrlEncode(request.RequestUri.AbsoluteUri.ToLower());
Initially I copied this functionality as is and wrote the nodejs equivalent as such:
 var requestUri = encodeURIComponent(URL.toLowerCase());

The encoding of the URL in C# keeps everything in lowercase - for e.g: https:// becomes https%3a%2f%2f - whereas nodeJS uppercases its encoding characters - https%3A%2F%2F - this is what as causing the incorrect hashing.
The solution is to just move the lowercase function to after the encoding has been done on the URL. Like so:
var requestUri = encodeURIComponent(URL).toLowerCase();

Seems rather simple but when trying to replicate the C# solution you may not pick up that the two URL encoders work differently.
Final solution: (updated to crypto thanks to Yoryo)
const fetch = require(""node-fetch"");
const uuid = require(""uuid"");
const crypto = require('crypto');

var URL = ""https://urltoapi.com"";

var itemAPPId = config.itemAPPId;
var APIKey = config.itemAPIKey;

var requestUri = encodeURIComponent(URL).toLowerCase();
var requestHttpMethod = ""GET""; //should be dynamic

var requestTimeStamp = Math.floor(new Date().getTime() / 1000).toString();

var nonce = uuid.v1().replace(/-/g, '');
var signatureRawData = itemAPPId + requestHttpMethod + requestUri + requestTimeStamp + nonce;

var key = Buffer.from(APIKey, 'base64');
var requestSignatureBase64String = crypto.createHmac('sha256', key).update(signatureRawData, 'utf8').digest('base64');

const hitExternalAPI = async url => {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(url, { method: 'GET', headers: { ""Authorization"": ""amx ""+itemAPPId+"":""+requestSignatureBase64String+"":""+nonce+"":""+requestTimeStamp } })
    .then(res => {
      console.log(res.ok);
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(""Error"",error);

}

The value for Authorization header is computed HMACSHA256 for the request body. For testing, I used http://www.freeformatter.com/hmac-generator.html to compute HMACSHA256 and I made sure that I am using the same secret key to compute hmac.
In Node.js I am using the same request body to compute the HMACSHA256 using the following code
app.use(bodyParser.json({
    verify: function (req, res, buf, encoding) {
        console.log('json encoding: ', encoding);
        var hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'a secret');
        hmac.update(buf.toString());
        req.hasha = hmac.digest('hex');
        console.log(""hmac: "", req.hasha);

        // get rawBody
        req.rawBody = buf.toString();
        console.log(req.rawBody);

    }
}));

The problem is, that gives me wrong HMACSHA256 value. It feels like something is being modified before I process the buffer. I am not sure what am I doing wrong or if there is a better way of doing it.

I am having trouble successfully verifying a webhook request from Trello. Here's what I know.
Trello's webhook documentation here states:

Each webhook trigger contains the HTTP header X-Trello-Webhook. The header is a base64 digest of an HMAC-SHA1 hash. The hashed content is the concatenation of the full request body and the callbackURL exactly as it was provided during webhook creation. The key used to sign this text is your application’s secret.

Which is understandable. They go on to say

Because of certain defaults in the crypto utilities in node, the payloads that we sign are treated as binary strings, not utf-8. For example, if you take the en-dash character (U+2013 or 8211 in decimal), and create a binary buffer out of it in Node, it will show up as a buffer of [19], which are the 8 least significant bits of 8211. That is the value that is being used in the digest to compute the SHA-1.

This is less clear to me. My understanding is that each character of the payload (body + callbackURL) has been put into an 8-bit integer, with the overflow ignored. (Because 8211 == 0b10000000010011, and 0b00010011 == 19) This is where I think my problem is.
The function I am using to accommodate Trello's node payload issue is:
func bitShift(s string) []byte {
    var byteString []byte

    // For each rune in the string
    for _, c := range s {

        // Create a byte slice
        b := []byte(string(c))

        // Take the sign off the least significant byte
        tmp := b[len(b)-1] << 1
        tmp = tmp >> 1

        // Append it to the byte string
        byteString = append(byteString, tmp)
    }
    return byteString
}

It is also very possible that I am doing something wrong with the basic verification step. It looks okay to me, though I am somewhat new to this.
// VerifyNotificationHeader ...
func VerifyNotificationHeader(signedHeader, trelloAPISecret string, requestURL *url.URL, body []byte) bool {

    // Put callbackURL and body into byte slice
    urlBytes := bitShift(requestURL.String())
    bitBody := bitShift(string(body))

    // Sign, hash, and encode the payload
    secret := []byte(trelloAPISecret)
    keyHMAC := hmac.New(sha1.New, secret)
    keyHMAC.Write(append(bitBody, urlBytes...))
    signedHMAC := keyHMAC.Sum(nil)
    base64signedHMAC := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(signedHMAC)

    if comp := strings.EqualFold(base64signedHMAC, signedHeader); !comp {
        return false
    }
    return true
}

Let me know if you need any more information. Thank you!
Update: This is solved, check out the answers.
","Why are you throwing away the MSB? You're converting each rune to byte, which is signless (and actually an alias for uint8), so that bit holds information that you're losing. 
You might consider using a function like this instead:

func ascii(s string) []byte {
    var ret []byte
    for _, r := range s {
        ret = append(ret, byte(r))
    }
    return ret
}

Since rune is an alias for int32, the cast to byte just drops the top 24 bits, which is what you want.
(Caveat: this assumes little-endianness.)

","There were two problems with my code. The major issue was my use of requestURL.String() for the callbackURL. 
In the comments above http.Request.URL: 

For most requests, fields other than Path and RawQuery will be empty.

It turned out that requestURL.String() was only giving the [Path] portion of [Scheme]://[Host][Path]. The correct callbackURL is 
callbackURL := ""https://"" + request.Host + request.URL.String()

"38253904","Python and Java MAC SHA256 encoding generating VERY SIMILAR KEY","I'm creating a signed request (SHA256 and base64) using Java and validating this request in Python. The keys that I generated are really similar:
Java:
UjuGTll3GF7H8MHWyJc41NAEcd-OZOeJLT9PiAevcsw

Python :
UjuGTll3GF7H8MHWyJc41NAEcd+OZOeJLT9PiAevcsw

The only diference happens with char + and char -. I cannot change the java code because I don't have access to it, I only know that it uses javax.crypto.Mac. However, my python code is:
import hmac
import hashlib
hmac.new(api_secret, url, hashlib.sha256).digest().encode('base64')

The variables api_secret and url have the same input in both languages (Java and Python)
What am I missing?
","digest() returns a string, so encode is just the standard encode method. According to the list of standard encodings, specifying base64 as the encoding means that base64.encodestring will be used. The alphabet used by that function includes + and /, which are the last two characters in the standard Base64 alphabet:
>>> base64.encodestring(chr(248))
'+A==\n'

If you want an encoded string that uses - and _ instead of + and /, you need to use base64.urlsafe_b64encode:
>>> base64.urlsafe_b64encode(chr(248))
'-A=='

So you'd need to do something like:
base64.urlsafe_b64encode(hmac.new(api_secret, url, hashlib.sha256).digest())

For this to work, though, you need to check that the Java code is also producing _ instead of /, like urlsafe_b64encode.

hmacSHA256digest(  ""secret"".getBytes(""UTF-8""), msg) = ""244d9c89069406d40803722ec6a793e5e04c55234d9ca03039a7b505cb3f8f00""

However, if I right-pad the secret key with an arbitrary number of \0 bytes, the hash comes back as the same for different byte arrays like:

""secret""
""secret\0""
""secret\0\0""

So, JavaX HMAC SHA256 is returning the same hash, even though the byte[] array returned from getBytes(""UTF-8"") for the secret just has a few additional zeros at the end (so it's not a UTF-8 issue):
hmacSHA256digest(   ""secret"".getBytes(""UTF-8""), msg)

Calls to other JavaX methods for MD5 and plain SHA256 do not return the same hash when extra \0 s are appended to the secret, so they pass our security test case for hash uniqueness across different secrets. Is the failure of this zero-padded-secrets case with MAC/SHA256 a possible attack vector?

Since JavaX HMAC SHA256 failed this zero-padded-secrets test case that passed for the plain SHA256/MD5 algorithms mentioned above, can anyone explain the difference in the behavior and if this can be exploited? 
","This is the correct behavior of the HMAC construct, by design.
The secret key should ideally be of the size of the block size of the underlying hash algorithm. For SHA-256, the block size is 512 bits, so your key should be 64 bytes.
From the RFC 2104, if a key is longer than the block size, it will be shortened by way of passing it through the hash function and using the hash as the key. If the key is shorter than the block size, it will be extended by appending zeros.
This is the first step of the HMAC algorithm:

(1) append zeros to the end of K to create a B byte string 
  (e.g., if K is of length 20 bytes and B=64, then K will be appended with 44 zero bytes 0x00)

The recommendation from the RFC is to use keys that are at least the size of the output of the hash function, 32 bytes in your case. Even though this will still fail your test case that the key can be padded with zeroes and produce the same HMAC.

"15554190","How to guarantee counter synchronisation between client and server for counter in hmac-based one time password implementation?","We are trying to implement a hmac-based one time password protocol for use authenticating users over our api.
The idea is to encrypt a unique identifier for the user (uid) against a private key and an incremental counter. Then increment the counter for the next call.
encrypt(uid, private_key, counter)
# now increment the counter for the next call

Then on the server side, decrypt using the private key and the counter to get the user identifier (uid).
decrypt(encrpyted_string, private_key, counter)
# now increment the counter for the next received request

This works fine. Each call is completely unique (one time) because of the counter.
However how would we handle synchronisation of the counter? What happens if the client generates a request, increments the counter for the next call, and sends the request, but the server is offline and never receives the request, or there is an internet connectivity issue and the request never gets through - now the server and the client are out of sync with each other's counters.
Is this a case of ""you should know if a request has been submitted""? I.e. we could add a response header from the server to say whether the counter has been incremented and only if it has do we increment the counter in the app too... but then the same could be said the other way around - we could send a request, the server receives it, increments its own counter  and sends a response, but the internet connection has been interrupted whilst the server was processing its request and the app never receives the response, never increments its counter and therefore the two are out of sync again.
Thanks for any insight you can give me.
","To synchronize counter between server and client just check some range of OTP. If Client sends OTP for current counter - all is ok, it is nothing to do, if client sends OTP in some range near current counter (~15) - it's mean, that client can be authenticated, but you need update counter on a server.
In a case when there is big desynchnization you should ask two consistent OTP and check if they was correct on wide range of counters. If it was - set your server counter to founded value.

An attacker installs a fake trusted certificate into a browser and hijacks the session.
A link to your site is sent, but the redirection to SSL is intercepted and a non-SSL session commences.

There are others, but the story is this: SSL is complicated and often attacked in inventive ways. If your connection is secure, then the hashing has little value compared to the complexity in code for humans and the cost in cpu time. However, if the SSL session is compromised, then you've still saved your key. Much as we hash passwords in databases despite the fact that nobody undesirable should have access, hashing your key despite SSL would be wise.

","The channel may be secure, but that doesn't tell you anything about endpoints: depending on the browser in question (and its plugins/extensions/...), your key could very well end up in a disk-based cache somewhere on the user's computer, and it could sit there until the end of forever.

auth_request = auth_request('1WZbtMTbMbo2NsW12vOz9IuPM', '1IuUeW4IEWatK87zBTENHj1T17s'):

What I've tried so far:
       public static string TEST(string timestamp4, string apikey1, string apisecret1)
       {


           HMACSHA256 hmc1 = new HMACSHA256(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(apisecret1));

           string b641 = Convert.ToBase64String(hmres1).Replace(""="", """");

But with this, I cannot re-generate the correct sample signature. The Sample Apikey,Secret,timestamp and their product signature:

Instead, the signature I end up with is:

Generated Signature 3EHLmGeh0jK9vRLgh/0j5LgQU6h/nijzj4G9KBBjv10

I have tried to feed the parameters one by one to the encryption function but that didn't go well.
When I use the real function to generate a signature with the real Api Key and Secret and realtime timestamp, the returned message from the server shows that timestamp is incorrect(but I couldn't see any problem), and that is also feed into the signature, which could have been solely due to the incorrect timestamp but even with the provided sample ApiKey and Secret, the test function generates entirely different structure.(with ""/"" in it and shorter)
There is no problem so far with the Json request function, but, just in case, this is what it should look like(the signature given her differs from the above):
{
    ""e"": ""auth"",
    ""auth"": {
        ""key"": ""1WZbtMTbMbo2NsW12vOz9IuPM."",

    }
}
I apologize in advance if I missed any existing topics explaining this problem, and I'd greatly appreciate if someone could shed some light on this issue.

hash_hmac('sha512', $password . $salt, $hmac_key);

Is 4096 bits enough for a key?
Thank you!
","For password hashing? Sure. Just long enough salt will be enough.
You need to realise, what is the purpose of your using hash here. You're hashing passwords, so that if anyone gets hold of these hashes, they cannot infer original passwords from them. We use salts, so that brute force and rainbow table based attacks are less effective, and we make salts unique for each password, so that two users, using same passwords have different hashes. HMAC does not add anything to security here, except acting as kind of salt.
HMAC is relevant, when you use hashing function as a digital signature of message/file (the way php.net uses it one their downloads page for example). You use HMAC key, so that only people that know this key can verify authenticity of hashed content (as contrasted to php.net downloads, where everyone can check md5 of downloaded file) and to make it more difficult to spoof the message that produces same hash (you need to know the key, to know what hash to target)

The way I am planning to do this is:

User enters information on the site. Information is associated with the user via server-side session.
User completes entering information, server sends an access URL via e-mail to the user roughly in the form of: http://siteurl/<user identifier>/<signature: HMAC(secret + salt + user identifier)>
User clicks URL, site looks up user ID and salt and computes the HMAC with the server-stored secret and authenticates if the computed HMAC and signature match.

My question is: is this a reasonably secure way to accomplish what I'm looking to do? Are there common attacks that would render it useless? Is there a compelling reason to abandon my desire to avoid a username/password? Is there a must-read book or article on the subject?
Note that I'm not dealing with credit card numbers or anything exceedingly private, but I would still like to keep the information reasonably secure.
","One word (well, actually two) - Referer header.
The next site your user goes to after visiting yours will see his credentials in this header. Moreover, the user will not be able to change his credentials after they have been compromised that way.
The idea of username/password authentication is that it involves two separate pieces of information - a known user id and an unknown password that can be freely changed on per-user basis. In your system (apart from the Referer thing), there is one single password for all - the ""secret."" I also suspect it will be reasonably easy to bruteforce the signature (since I know my user id) and recover the secret, rendering the whole system useless.

","I've pondered similar passwordless login for iPhone apps — the biggest problem for a webapp is that logging in becomes unnecessarily tedious.
That said, here's a simple modification:

User enters e-mail address.
Server generates a random authentication (e.g. 128 bits of /dev/urandom, base64-encoded) token and saves H(authtoken) to the DB along with a timestamp, and then sends an email with https://example.com/login/userid?auth=authtoken
User clicks URL, server checks that the token is in the DB and not expired, removes the token from the DB and sets a session cookie.

Your server needs to store a little more state, but it needed to store state anyway. It works roughly the same as any good password reset flow, which presumably makes it theoretically no less secure. In practice, however, it does not leave as obvious an audit trail as account-hijack-via-password-reset because the ""password reset"" flow is now the normal login flow.
You could also do something similar with a MAC and timestamp (uid,timestamp,MAC_k(uid,timestamp)) — the basic problem there is that anyone with access to the MAC key (e.g. a database backup) can generate arbitrary authentication tokens, and databases are leaked all the time.
When hashing/MACing, beware of ""cryptographic splicing"" attacks.
Additionally, a common mistake is to reveal whether a given email address has an account (often the login says ""invalid email/password"" but the password reset flow gives it away — the better way is to always send an email, and say ""there's no account associated with this email"" in the email, ideally in the same number of bytes as the success response!).

","An HMAC can not be ""decrypted"". Like a hash function, HMAC is a function that can not be inverted. The only difference between a HMAC function and a hash function is that the first one involves a ""secret"" and the second one has a public definition.
If you are planning to use CryptoJS use AES (main difference between hmac/hash and cipher is that the second one can be reversed)

The API calls are authenticated with HMAC using the same scheme as described in Ruby's ApiAuth library which I use to verify signed requests. We now need to support multipart/form-data file uploads.
I'm attempting to write a bash script as an example API call using cURL. I already have one that works without file uploads (POST request with only JSON data) here.
The part I'm stuck on is generating the $content_md5 for the multipart request. I understand the content of a multipart request has content sections separated by the boundary string, as described here.
Problem 1: cURL generates it's own boundary string and appends it to my content-type header
Problem 2: Should I MD5 the entire request body with boundary strings and section headers included?
So basically, I need to be able to know what the boundary string is so that I can generate a string that looks like the content sections and boundaries described in the http multipart format, lines 7 through 23 so that I may MD5 it.
Is there a way to do this with only cURL? Is there a better way to construct such an HMAC signed multipart request?
I was hoping to do it with cURL to present as a generalized example to 3rd party devs that will integrate with our API so they can sign their requests in whatever language they're using.

","(Expanded from the comments) 
CF11 has an HMAC function already built in, so it is possible you may not need that UDF. I would suggest giving it a try. Take note that the C# code uses UTF8Encoding.ASCII:

ASCII characters are limited to the lowest 128 Unicode characters,
  from U+0000 to U+007F.... 
Note that the ASCII encoding has an 8th bit ambiguity that can allow
  malicious use, but the UTF-8 encoding removes ambiguity about the 8th
  bit. ... It uses replacement fallback to replace each string that it
  cannot encode and each byte that it cannot decode with a question mark
  (""?"") character.

Assuming you need to maintain compatibility with some other application, and must keep the same encoding, UTF8Encoding.ASCII should correspond to ""US-ASCII"" encoding in CF/Java, but do some testing to verify the handling of invalid characters.  If you have the flexibility to change the encoding, I would recommend using UTF-8 instead. Keep in mind, the CF function always returns hexadecimal. If you need a base64 string instead, you will have to convert it with binaryEncode() and binaryDecode().
Example:
<!--- Only required when hard coding UTF8 characters into a script --->
<cfprocessingdirective pageEncoding=""utf-8"">
<cfset message = ""Pi π and Sigma Σ."">
<cfset key = ""abcdefghijk"">
<cfset hexHash = hmac(message, key, ""HMACSHA1"", ""US-ASCII"")>
<cfset base64Hash = binaryEncode(binaryDecode(hexHash, ""hex""), ""base64"")>
<cfdump var=""#base64Hash#"">

Result:
HMACSHA1 = J2AZf+zhrebIA/tK3i5PYb4b/Fo= 

Side note, about the CFHMAC UDF: be very careful with encoding when extracting the bytes of a string. As I noted in the comments, it is best avoid using getBytes() because it assumes the default encoding, whatever that may be. That means it may not always return the desired results, and can vary from one jvm to another. Instead, it is better to always supply a charset explicitly ie getBytes(""UTF-8"") , getBytes(""US-ASCII""), etcetera.

"27974647","using was cognito identity id to protect my rest end points via hmac?","Can I use AWS Cognito IdentityID as HMAC key on SSL to protect my REST services?
I would like to secure and setup the following application.

A HTML/Javascript client using AWS Cognito (future plans to sync across clients) on an SSL Page
A Spring Boot REST app
AWS DynamoDB

So the flow would be:

I setup the javascript buttons for google+, amazon and Facebook logins and grab the AWS Cognito token.
Once I have the Cognito ID, I make a call to my user service (/user/auth) and see if the user exists using the ID. If they don't I create a profile record in DynamoDB. (cognito id is the key)
If they exist I can look up the user profile in dynamoDB and get their authorisation to be used in Spring Security.
I want to now secure all calls to my service with HMAC by using the Cognito ID. 

is this safe? 
Can I just add spring security on top of Spring boot and implement HMAC checks? If so how? Why isn't this in spring already via OAUTH?
thanks in advance.

//signing_key: 582cf07cc7ea5cd0a5c0a1f6422cf32eef38fdae7a4073d17ba0195cbf5c85ce

The example doesn't show the signing_key result, so I can't know if the signing_key is correct. What I know is the resulting Signature is not like in the example result.
The example url result will give ""Request has expired"", which is expected, but when using a current date, I get SignatureDoesNotMatch.
Something is wrong with the Signature generation.
Thanks for any help!

Any help is much appreicated.
","I strongly recommend you use the Crypto.cfc by Bennadel.It provides methods for generating Hmac values with the SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5 algorithms and is very cleanly written.
Also, I would prefer to use the hash_hmac() function available in PHP for it's performance and simplicity.
string hash_hmac('md5', $input, $secretKey);

As far as I can understand, you're comparing a string output with a binary output, which won't match. md5 returns a string output but the doFinal() in javax.crypto.Mac returns a byte[] representation. You need to typecast accordingly. Correct it and the result is the same.
Update
You can check the base code in both the language:
ColdFusion Code
PHP Code
As you can see, the results are the same. Dude, it's your code only and it's working fine with the addition of only lcase as pointed by @Leigh.

"38195246","Captcha substitution on mobile devices","We have a service where user can sign-up. This process is protected by reCAPTCHA to prevent automatized sign-ups. The problem is that on mobile devices reCAPTCHA is not a convenience. Therefore we decided that the sign-up API will accept also some special tokens instead of reCAPTCHA response.
Now the question is how to implement this token. Our first approach was to equip the mobile application with some constant secret that would be sent to the server as the token. But this secret can be revealed if a hacker redirects the request to his server (by updating DNS record of the API domain and installing his certificate as trusted to the mobile device).
Now our final approach is to compute the token as HMAC-SHA1 on username+secret (do we need a here secred - maybe just for making the input long enough?). The username will be taken from sign-up input. Then the server would authorize it by validating the hash. In his case it would be possible to do a replay attack but it is OK because duplicate username would be rejected.
Is this approach correct? Maybe there are other alternatives to captcha on mobile devices?
Also is it possible to get and reverse engineer the application from iOS (ipa file) considering it will be hosted in Appstore and to extract the key (and secret)?
In case of android this is possible - is there a way to prevent it?
","You found the disadvantage: you still with a token which doesn't change for the same user. It's ok in your use case (register), but there could be another use cases where is not useful (for example a password recovery feature. In that case, a possible hacker might generate valid tokens for any user is your are asking for the username).
My solution would be:

Create an algorithm (on both mobile app and your backend) that takes a ""public token"" and creates a ""secret token"", which solves the captcha. It might be a simple SHA1 hash (I don't recommend), a combination between public token and a salt, the user id and public token, etc...
Create an endpoint on your API that generates public and secret tokens. Store secret token in your backend and return public token to the client (mobile app).
You app then should ask for the public token, generate the secret token and send it to the API. The API verifies that secret token is already stored in your database, and if it's the case then captcha is solved.

An improvement would be making stored secret tokens to expire after X seconds.
Hope it helps!

Now that I've successfully encrypt the message on the client-side, but how do I go about authenticating the request before the request entering the WebMethods?
I suppose I should add a HttpModule to tap into the Init() event and do validation there?
But as soon as I added the HttpModule to my WCF project and configure the web.config, I'm getting error saying:
An error occurred while receiving the HTTP response to http://localhost:61884/MyService.svc.
This could be due to the service endpoint binding not using the HTTP protocol.
This could also be due to an HTTP request context being aborted by the server (possibly due to the service shutting down).
See server logs for more details.

Am I right about using HttpModule in this context?
My web.config, just in-case

","Hashes don't work on strings - they work on the binary representation of the string. Now you use UTF-8 as encoding for the dotnet version, while the JavaScript version is very likely not to use UTF-8 - so you get different binary representations, resulting in different hashes.
Use either webttolkit or the hackish var utfstring = unescape(encodeURIComponent(rawstring)); to convert to UTF-8 before calcualting the hash.

"29457974","Why are REST calls to S3 using the AWS Signature v4 not really using the signature process?","I'm working with the AWS Federated Web Identitiy Playground and am wondering about the signature V4 usage to access AWS or specifically S3.
If I look at the Sig4.js file being loaded, it
/**
  * Contains functions to construct a canonical request, create the string to sign,
  * calcuate the signature, and finally to make a signed sigv4 request. Also contains
  * a function to make REST calls to S3. 
  */

I'm not sure about the methot allowing to make REST calls to S3 (provided method callS3WithREST). Although the method is included in the sig4, it does not use any of it's logic.
When reading the AWS docs they stress to always use signature V4 for all request to AWS services. So I'm wondering:
Question:
Should I not use the signature to make REST calls to S3? What is the purpose of the signature process then? Thanks for some clarification.
","You definitely need to sign your REST requests to S3, or they won't won't succeed unless the request involves something available to anonymous users.  And, yes, you ""should"" use Signature Version 4 to interact with S3, because (among other reasons) newer S3 regions don't support the older Signature Version 2.
What's curious, here, is that callS3WithREST appears to actually be an implementation of Signature Version 2.
Why this is there is not at all clear to me, but I have a convincing theory: it's old code copy/pasted and/or left over from a V2 script that's a predecessor to this one.
S3's implementation of Signature Version 2 was almost exactly the same as V2 as supported by other AWS services... but different enough to be incompatible.
(S3's V2 ""string to sign,"" unlike the standard implementation, does not include the Host: header value as the 2nd line, presumably because the bucket name that is required in the ""canonical resource"" section made it resundant, and there are usually multiple variant hostnames for the same bucket).
So, a V2 signing library would have to make an exception for S3, due to the difference in the algorithm.
This isn't true for V4, which is sufficiently comprehensive that the same code can sign requests for S3 as well as other services, if it doesn't make any improper assumptions.
So my suspicion is that this is best explained as some inappropriately left over code from when, in a previous lifetime, this was a Signature V2 script that was transmogrified into a V4 script.

"12519741","Can I use a hashed password as the secret for generating a hmac?","I think it would be very comfortable to use the user's password hash as the secret for generating a hmac. Why is OAuth and others using tokens and nonces?
I think of something like this:
Client enters a password in the ui.
The application registers with the webservice using the hash of that password, which is stored on the server.
Form now on that hash hasn't to be transmitted again.
The client can always regenerate the secret by asking the user to enter the password and hashing it. Every message is signed with this hash, the server can look it up by username or guid and check if the sent mac is valid.
A intruder on the server can get that hash, but doesn't know the users real password, anyway he could send valid request with that hash. But this is not likely to happen, the saved hashes could also be hashed again using a nonce. Anyway because the pwd-file will be on a client's server it should be obfuscated using e.g. base64 to avoid the file looking like {""password"":""a4bd146hashhashhash""}.
Most of all the real password of the user won't ever be transmitted. The request's will be secured with a timestamp/token against replay (I recognize the purpose of the token here).
Sending a hash would be perfectly applicable for me because the client will never be a simple website with a  tag e.g.. The webservice will be used in a ajax-based application and a java desktop application, both of them capable of hashing strings...
What's wrong with that? It's so simple, more RESTFul than anything related to authentication, and i think yet effective. What am I missing?

","MD5 is not good enough anymore. Use HMAC-SHA256 or better. Potentially use a key derivation function such as PBKDF2 to make it even more improbably to forge the MAC.
You could of course use public key signature algorithm like RSA, but you've got to ask yourself the following. If you will be the only one who needs to verify the signature, then you don't need the additional overhead of RSA and you can safely stick to HMAC. Because the problem with HMAC is that the salt has to be known to the ""signing"" and the ""verifying"" party.

"16065370","SHA512 client handshake implementation","I'm attempting to make an hmac implementation that interacts with a server api and the only example I have to go off of is a python snippet. Unfortunately I've never touched python and my Java is a bit rusty.
The python example code includes the function:
handshake = str(hmac.new(secret, hash_data, sha512))

where secret is the decoded hash retrieved from the server being connected to,
hash_data is the data to be sent,
and sha512 is the ""MessageDigest"" type when converted to Java.
I'm just wondering if there is a close java equivalent to this function. It seems like it should be in the Java.Security class but I'm having trouble finding hmac functions and implementations.
","API's and functions related to cryptology are present in javax.crypto, not java.security.
I don't know Python, but given your description and the documentation of the methods shown, you want something along these lines:
final Charset charset = Charset.forName(""ASCII"");
final String secret = ""mykey"";
final String data = ""A message to be turned to gibberish"";
final String algorithm = ""HmacSHA512"";

byte[] keyBytes = secret.getBytes(charset);
SecretKeySpec signingKey = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, algorithm);

Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(algorithm);
mac.init(signingKey);

byte[] hashed = mac.doFinal(data.getBytes(charset));
System.out.println(new String(hashed, charset));

The code assumes byte and string conversions are based on ASCII (which I believe Python uses by default). You will in all likelihood have to tweak the logic, but its a good starting point.

"11123427","Is it useful to loop an hmac hash?","I need to store a password in a database, and I used to store an sha1 hash of a salted password alongside a random salt, which was looped, like so:
$salt = sha1(microtime().mt_rand());
for ($i=0; $i < 4000; $i++) {
    $password = sha1($password.$salt);
}

(In my example, $password and $salt were stored inside the db).
I recently discovered the hash_hmac() function, which apparently is a much more secure function than a simple SHA1 hash. I plan on using it with the same pattern (the salt being the secret key), but I was wondering if it was worthwile to loop it like in my previous example. If anyone could give me some insight, that'd be much appreciated.
","Yes.
What you're doing here is known as key stretching and it multiplies the time an attacker has to take to check each candidate password against a hash.  In your example, it increases the time by 4000x.  The specific threat you are protecting against here is when an attacker gets hold of your hashes (such as what happened with LinkedIn, Last.fm and eHarmony recently) and can devote as much CPU power as he can afford to cracking them.
Rather than rolling your own, if this is anything other than a research project, you should use a well-known and publicly tested function like bcrypt(), PBKDF2() or scrypt().
The number in that loop should be much higher than 4000 and since your attacker will be using a C loop rather than a PHP loop, you won't be able to do as many in a reasonable time as he will.  Even in a PHP loop, I can do 500,000 in 0.3 seconds.  The above hashing algorithms solve this problem since they will be implemented in C.  (Not all of them may be available in PHP.)  It seems bcrypt is in 5.3 but it's called CRYPT_BLOWFISH.  Details on how to use it are on the crypt() page.

hash_hmac() is not a more secure hashing algorithm but rather is used for a different purpose.  See the end of Thomas' answer here.  Algorithms like MD5 and the SHA family are general purpose hashing algorithms that are normally used as part of a more specific algorithm for a particular purpose.  For instance, some of the above password hashing algorithms use general purpose hashing algorithms many times.  has_hmac() asks you which general purpose hashing algorithm you would like to use.

So I'm attempting to authenticate with an API which requires grabbing a private key that is provided by the website in hex representation (e.g. an example token is ""665c20b3c4517e025311160b7fec3fdb9b4d091f142d308c568d0eec4745f569"") and decode to ascii to create a keyed hash so I may pass it in an http header which is part of the authentication process.
When it comes to python2 I can simply 
import hashlib
import hmac
import requests


headers = {
           ""custom header"": hmac.new(""665c20b3c4517e025311160b7fec3fdb9b4d091f142d308c568d0eec4745f569"".decode(""hex""),

          }
requests.get(""my url"", headers=headers)

However, I cannot get this working in python3 despite several hours of googling, various SO posts and looking at the official docs for hmac.
This seems to stem from the differences between how python2 and 3 handle strings.
In python2 running ""665c20b3c4517e025311160b7fec3fdb9b4d091f142d308c568d0eec4745f569"".decode(""hex"") returns this string of characters ""f\ ��Q~S�?ۛM   -0�V��GE�i"" which is passed to hmac.new()
Somethings I have tried in Python3 after searching around:
bytes.fromhex('665c20b3c4517e025311160b7fec3fdb9b4d091f142d308c568d0eec4745f569').decode('utf-8')

bytes.fromhex('665c20b3c4517e025311160b7fec3fdb9b4d091f142d308c568d0eec4745f569').decode('ascii')

But these all error or output different returns that hmac.new() won't accept. I'm assuming there's a simple fix that I'm just ignorant on since I'm not very knowledgeable about the nuances of how p2 and p3 handle strings.
","One of your attempts is correct:
In [1]: import binascii
   ...: binascii.unhexlify(b""665c20b3c4517e025311160b7fec3fdb9b4d091f142d308c568d0eec4745f569"")

If you get a wrong result from hmac afterwards, you can post a question about that specific scenario, with some examples comparing python2/3.
You may be running into a problem with the message itself, which needs to explicitly use bytes, not a string. These two give the same values:

","I don't think there is anything out of the box to do this, simply because it is an unusual requirement for the server to verify that the code on the client calling the service is authorized code.
Generally, it is sufficient to establish trust as follows:

Server has a certificate and service uses SSL - this way clients are confident that they are connecting to the correct server machine.
Clients provide authentication details (eg username/password, certificate etc) to the server so the server knows the connecting client can be trusted.

You are attempting to go the extra step to verify that not only are the users/machines verified, but also that the code running is verified - this is simply overkill.  If the code running is not verified, either:

One of the machines has been compromised, in which case you have bigger issues to worry about.
One of your users has written code against your service and is using it 'illegally'.  This should not be a problem if your service only allows authorized users to perform 'dangerous' operations.

","Certificates are definitely the way to go in your situation. 
Your server will easily be authenticated by clients because it will provide a certificate known to each client, SSL is a good option here.
The server will also be able to authenticate clients by requesting that every client should provide a certificate (server can check for a specific issuer of the certificate - your own issuer in that case). 
Now you just need to correctly manage/secure your certificate server to make sure that it won't be compromised.

"1868525","How to Detect Diferences between GET and POST ViewModel Values in a form?","I have a single view that handles a lot of Models of type VoyagesViewModel, in that view the user can create a new voyage or edit all the active voyages, so i have different instances of the same object type in that view.
each form contains something like:
<% = Html.Hidden(""Voyages[""+ i +""].VoyageDetails["" + i2 + ""].Id"", location.Id)%>
<% = Html.TextBox(""Voyages["" + i + ""].VoyageDetails["" + i2 + ""].ArrivalDate"", location.ArrivalDate, new { @class = ""dates"" })%><% = Html.ValidationMessage(""Voyages["" + i + ""].VoyageDetails["" + i2 + ""].ArrivalDate"", ""*"")%>
<% = Html.TextBox(""Voyages["" + i + ""].VoyageDetails["" + i2 + ""].DepartureDate"", location.DepartureDate, new { @class = ""dates"" })%><% = Html.ValidationMessage(""Voyages["" + i + ""].VoyageDetails["" + i2 + ""].DepartureDate"", ""*"")%>
<% = Html.Hidden(""Voyages["" + i + ""].VoyageDetails["" + i2 + ""].LocationID"", location.LocationID)%>
<% = Html.Hidden(""Voyages["" + i + ""].VoyageDetails["" + i2 + ""].LocationName"", location.LocationName)%>
<% = Html.Hidden(""Voyages["" + i + ""].VoyageDetails["" + i2 + ""].VesselName"", location.VesselName)%>
<% = Html.Hidden(""Voyages["" + i + ""].VoyageDetails["" + i2 + ""].VesselID"", location.VesselID)%>
<% = Html.CheckBox(""Voyages["" + i + ""].VoyageDetails["" + i2 + ""].remove"", location.remove)%> (remove)

I have 8 to 10 of this in that View, when the user POST the form(I have all this fields in a single form), i want to be able to detect if the user change something in a voyage to save it, so i don't have to save that specific voyage if no changes where made.
To check this i have a hidden field and i do this:
 <% = Html.Hidden(""Voyages["" + i + ""].hash"", TamperProofing.GetExpiringHMAC(new System.Web.Script.Serialization.JavaScriptSerializer().Serialize(Model), DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(15)))%>

Im using HMAC to get a hashed version of the hole object, but first i serialize the object into a string format (JSON Format):
{""Id"":22,""VesselName"":""CAPTAIN P (CPP)"",""VesselID"":8,""VoyageDetails"":[{""Id"":58,""ArrivalDate"":""\/Date(1259298000000)\/"",""DepartureDate"":""\/Date(1259384400000)\/"",""LocationID"":404,""LocationHash"":null,""LocationName"":""Balboa, Panama (PABLB)"",""VesselName"":""CAPTAIN P (CPP)"",""VesselID"":8,""Order"":0,""Comment"":null,""remove"":false},{""Id"":60,""ArrivalDate"":""\/Date(1260248400000)\/"",""DepartureDate"":""\/Date(1260334800000)\/"",""LocationID"":406,""LocationHash"":null,""LocationName"":""Colon Free Zone, Panama (PACFZ)"",""VesselName"":""CAPTAIN P (CPP)"",""VesselID"":8,""Order"":0,""Comment"":null,""remove"":false},{""Id"":61,""ArrivalDate"":""\/Date(1260421200000)\/"",""DepartureDate"":""\/Date(1260507600000)\/"",""LocationID"":407,""LocationHash"":null,""LocationName"":""Cristobal, Panama (PACTB)"",""VesselName"":""CAPTAIN P (CPP)"",""VesselID"":8,""Order"":0,""Comment"":null,""remove"":false},{""Id"":62,""ArrivalDate"":null,""DepartureDate"":null,""LocationID"":408,""LocationHash"":null,""LocationName"":""Manzanillo, Panama (PAMAN)"",""VesselName"":""CAPTAIN P (CPP)"",""VesselID"":8,""Order"":0,""Comment"":null,""remove"":false},{""Id"":59,""ArrivalDate"":null,""DepartureDate"":null,""LocationID"":405,""LocationHash"":null,""LocationName"":""Coco Solo, Panama (PACSO)"",""VesselName"":""CAPTAIN P (CPP)"",""VesselID"":8,""Order"":0,""Comment"":null,""remove"":true}],""newVoyageDetail"":null,""isComplete"":false,""Code"":""A Code"",""position"":0,""hash"":null}

So when the user POST the form i check if changes where made to each voyage like this:
 var obj = new System.Web.Script.Serialization.JavaScriptSerializer().Serialize(_voyage);
     if (TamperProofing.VerifyChanges(obj, hash) == TamperProofing.HMACChanged.True)
    {
       //UPDATE
    }else
    {
       //DO Nothing, is the exact same object
    }

Serialize it again and compare both hashes, the one on the hidden against the recently calculated one, if it match it means nothing changed.
All works pretty well, i was just wondering, if there are any other options to do this?
And my other concern is the time that can take the serialization and all the HMAC thing with this large string generated by the Serialization against the time it could take just to Update unchanged object again to the DB.
EDIT: I don't need to know which field changed, just if something changed.
","If server performance is a concern, you might consider creating a ""changed"" field for each record and using Javascript to set it when one of the user-editable field values changes.
To ensure correctness in downlevel browsers or NoScript fringe cases, a common pattern is to use a tri-state value, with one state meaning ""unknown"" or ""JS disabled"".  For example, you initialize the fields on the server to 0 (or empty), have your JS code set them all to 1 on load, and then to 2 when the field is modified.  If your server sees a 0/null/empty on POST, then it falls back on the server-side method, in this case your hash-compare.  If it's set to 1, then it ignores that record, and if it's set to 2, then it automatically triggers an update.
This way, you could avoid computing hashes in 99% of cases, and still correctly handle the outliers.
This doesn't necessarily prevent tampering but you weren't too specific about what kind of tampering you're trying to prevent.  The most effective means of tamper-proofing is really to keep the object or information out of reach in the first place, i.e. in the session state or an encrypted cookie.
Does that help at all?

Here are our constraints:

Paid subscription based app.  We want to authorize each request made to the server to ensure it's coming from a paid customer's site.  Currently, we designed the API to accept HMAC Auth in the header and then compared it and the referrer host to what's in our db.
The API is RESTful.  We do not want cookies or sessions.
Authorization is only for the client hosted site (our paid customers) and not their audience.
Resources sent back (if request is validated) will then be embedded into our customers' HTML pages.
We want to minimize the amount of code sitting on our customers' servers.
We're open to SSL/HTTPS and Oauth, if needed.

Given the above parameters, how would you go about the client-side portion?  My first thoughts are to develop server code for generating the HMAC (sits on our customer's server) and then embed pass it to our iframe embedded on their page.
Thank you for your time and insights

"21672183","HOTP/TOTP client token uniqueness","Is it possible to use TOTP to generate tokens from multiple channels (where a channel is defined as a ""user"" using a certain shared key K_c for channel c), and in so doing identify the channel itself from the OTP?
For example, if two OTP's were generated with the both time sequence constant i_0, and shared secret keys K_1 and K_2 respectively, then:
A = HMAC-SHA-1(K_1, i_0) and
B = HMAC-SHA-1(K_2, i_0)
where A and B are the OTP's generated. My question is: would it be possible on the server side during validation to establish without the shadow of a doubt (mathematically speaking) that A is ""linked"" to channel 1 (K_1), and B to channel 2? In other words, every OTP generated using K_1 will be different to those OTP's generated using K_2 regardless of the truncation of the 160-bit output of HMAC. 
My second question would be that if this is the case (the two ""sequences"" are different), can their difference be quantified in terms of say a Hamming distance?

","Rather than return strlen(res_f); as the length of the output buffer, you need to return res_f_len.
There are three things that could happen with strlen() in your code:

If the HMAC message digest has a byte that equals zero, strlen will return a length that's shorter than the HMAC message digest.
If the HMAC message digest has no zero bytes, then strlen will read beyond the message digest, leading to one of two outcomes:


strlen reads through garbage in memory after the message digest, eventually stopping on a random 0.  strlen returns a value that's way too large.
If you're exceedingly lucky, the first byte after the message digest is 0, in which case strlen returns the actual length of the message digest.


So, only in the last scenario will you get the right value.  That pretty much seems wrong.
It appears tht HMAC_Final does update the length argument you pass to it.  (See the example in the top-voted answer to this StackOverflow question.)  That's why you pass a pointer-to-int.  You should just return this updated value.

This generates a string to the log but when compared to results using web based hash generators the results differ.
However if I use

without the \n the results generated in my Google Script and the web based hash generators match.
So I'm assuming the way Google Script is handling the new line is different to the web base generators but I can't figure out how to get them match or which one is the correct result.

"34522863","HMAC produces wrong results","All of this is new to me so please forgive my noobish question.
I'm trying to figure out HMAC step by step. 
Let's say I have a following SHA-1 method: 
public static string SHA_1(string input) 
{
    SHA1CryptoServiceProvider mySha = new SHA1CryptoServiceProvider();
    string temp = BitConverter.ToString(mySha.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(input)));
    temp = temp.Replace(""-"", """").ToUpper();
    return temp;
} 

It receives a plain text string;
Let's say my secret key is """" (empty string) and so is the message;
The HMAC is supposed to be: fbdb1d1b18aa6c08324b7d64b71fb76370690e1d
Now that's where I am a bit lost. I'll write down the steps as I understand them and please correct me if I am wrong (or where I am wrong rather). 

If the key is shorter than 64 bytes I need to pad it with 0's. 
So the padded key is 0x00 (x64 - because the key is empty, otherwise it's 64-key.Length);
Two constants each 64 bytes long are:

ipad = 0x36 (x64)
opad = 0x5c (x64)

because the key is empty string XOR results in the same opad and ipad, i.e.

ipad XOR key = ipad
opad XOR key = opad

At this point all left to do is to compute the HMAC itself. 

So: HMAC = Hash(opad || Hash(ipad || message)) and that should be it. 
But I am not sure how to execute this. 
The message is a text string. opad and ipad are uint/byte arrays. I can convert them to ASCII as well and receive respectively:
ipad_str = ""6666666666..."" x64
opad_str = ""\\\\\\\...."" x64
Now my HMAC is supposed to be: 
HMAC = SHA_1(""\\\\\\....""+ SHA_1(""6666666....""))
but the result doesn't match. Instead it is:

What am I missing here? Does the empty message have to be padded as well? 
I suspect that I misinterpret the concatenation, but I am not sure what other options I have. Should I leave ipad and opad as hex? SHA1 methods receives string so I must convert to some sort of a string, I just can't figure out what type exactly.  
Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks in advance and Happy New Year!
","The problem with my method was so obvious, it's not even funny. While appending the result of the opad and inner hash I left the inner hash in hex format but treated it as ASCII, as a result 104 bytes were sent to the outer hash instead of 84. So the solution is something like: HMAC = SHA_1(opad + HexToASCII(SHA_1(ipad)));

"27789310","HMAC with a time-window","I'm doing some tests with HMAC by using a time-window mechanism based on UTC+0 synced time. The server has a special public API call http://myserver.com/api/servertime/ that will return the server's exact UTC+0 time. This way the API users can sync their requesting client so it will be able to match the time window my API allows for secure calls. I built in a 30 minute timeslot (-15min - +15min).
My code looks like this:
func GenerateHmac512(message []byte, key []byte) []byte {
    h := hmac.New(sha512.New, key)
    h.Write(message)
    return []byte(base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(h.Sum(nil)))
}

func ValidateHmac512(message, messageMAC, key []byte) bool {
    var err error
    decryptedMessageMAC, err := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(string(messageMAC))

    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalln(err.Error())
        return false
    }

    mac := hmac.New(sha512.New, key)
    mac.Write(message)
    expectedMAC := mac.Sum(nil)
    return hmac.Equal(decryptedMessageMAC, expectedMAC)
}

func main() {
    timestamp := time.Now().Unix()
    key := []byte(""afad9411468602782fb62d904f623d87"")
    message := []byte(fmt.Sprintf(""SecretHash,Value1,Value2,Value3,TimeStamp:%d"", time.Now().Unix()))
    hmacHash := GenerateHmac512(message, key)
    hmacValid := ValidateHmac512(message, hmacHash, key)
    log.Println(timestamp)
    log.Println(string(hmacHash))
    log.Println(hmacValid)

    requestValid := false

    if timestamp > time.Now().Unix()-(60*15) && timestamp < time.Now().Unix()+(60+15) {
        requestValid = true
    }

    log.Println(requestValid)
}

I'm hashing the timestamp that will be publicly provided in the call in my HMAC hash, combined with the secret hash. I'm wondering if this is fool-proof enough, or it would need more work to make it totally solid? The call would be something like this:
POST http://myserver.com/api/users/
Value1 : Data1
Value2 : Data2
Value3 : Data3
Timestamp : 1420497639

Eventually when this is all OK I'm gonna send this data over SSL/TLS. I know SSL is more than enough and HMAC wouldn't be needed, but I like to have these 3 layers of security. And I want to benchmark variations of these layers to see what the performance impact is and how I can tweak it to have a good balance between performance and security.
","There's not much to answer here, an HMAC authenticates a message and verifies integrity, and that seems to be what you want. Also, TLS is only ""more than enough"" if you're authenticating the client. If this is an unauthenticated call, then HMAC is still reasonable to prove the knowledge of a shared secret.
Note that SecretHash is superfluous. You already have a secret shared key.

"23605869","Any holes in securing a HTTP request with HMAC using ONLY the HTTP method and URL?","I want to redirect my users browser using HTTP code 303 to a GET URL that I secure using HMAC.  Because the request will come from the users browser, I will not have fore-knowledge of the request headers.  So I am generating the HMAC hash using the values of the HTTP method and URL only. For example, the URL I want the browser to do to might be:
GET /download
    ?name=report.pdf
    &include=http://url1
    &include=http://url2

This create report.pdf for me, containing the contents of all the urls specified using the include query param.
My HMAC code will change this URL to be
GET /download
    ?name=report.pdf
    &include=http://url1
    &include=http://url2
    &hmac-algorithm=simple-hmac
    &hmac-signature=idhihhoaiDOICNK

I can issue HTTP 303 to the user using this URL, and the user will get their report.pdf.
As I am not including the request headers in the signature, I am wondering two things:
1) Can a would-be attacker take advantage of the fact that I am not signing the request headers?
2) Is there a better way to achieve what I am trying to do?
","When I realised that what I am talking about here is a signed URL, I checked the Amazon Docs and found ""REST Authentication Example 3: Query String Authentication Example"" in this document: http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/s3-developer-guide/RESTAuthentication.html.  
This example is about a signed URL for use through a browser.  About signing the headers, the document says:

You know that when the browser makes the GET request, it won't provide a Content-Md5 or a Content-Type header, nor will it set any x-amz- headers, so those parts are all kept empty.

In other words, Amazon leave the headers out of the signature.  
Amazon make no mention of potential security holes, so until I hear otherwise (or get hacked :) ), I will assume my approach above is fine.

Informally, we call this process ""signing the request,"" and we call
  the output of the HMAC algorithm the ""signature"" because it simulates
  the security properties of a real signature. Finally, you add this
  signature as a parameter of the request, using the syntax described in
  this section.
When the system receives an authenticated request, it fetches the AWS
  Secret Access Key that you claim to have, and uses it in the same way
  to compute a ""signature"" for the message it received. It then compares
  the signature it calculated against the signature presented by the
  requester.

But i presume both the requests wont be same right. Request is signed (great!!) but HMAC of the response from the client browser is going to be different since it contains extra data Right? so how come requests can validate even though they are valid
","You need to read the whole of the paragraphs you quoted from. Right before the piece you quoted it says:

To authenticate a request, you first concatenate selected elements of the request to form a string. You then use your AWS Secret Access Key to calculate the HMAC of that string.

So you calculate your HMAC from those selected elements, and when you submit the request, the server calculates an HMAC from those same elements, and then they are compared.

$innerHash = hash(HASH_ALGO, join($ikey) . $message, true);
$outerHash = hash(HASH_ALGO, join($okey) . $innerHash, true);

That said, both hash() and hash_hmac() are documented as being available since 5.1.2, so I'm not sure what this will achieve :)

I've extracted all keyring related material (client IV, MAC, Key and Server IV, MAC, key). 
When I receive the first Application_Data message (0x17), I am able to decrypt it, but unable to verify message integrity.
On RFC 2246 (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt), tells:

The MAC is generated as:
   HMAC_hash(MAC_write_secret, seq_num + TLSCompressed.type +
                 TLSCompressed.version + TLSCompressed.length +
                 TLSCompressed.fragment));

where ""+"" denotes concatenation.
seq_num
         The sequence number for this record.
hash
         The hashing algorithm specified by
         SecurityParameters.mac_algorithm.

Taking this as an example:
Chosen cipher_suite is TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256

client_mac = ""some random stuff""
message_type = 0x17
message_version = 0x0303
encrypted_message_length = 1184 (IV|Message|MAC|Offset)
decrypted_message_length = 1122 (removing IV, MAC and offset)
message = ""some message of length 1122""


client_mac is extracted from keyring_material
message_type is 0x17, because as an Application_data message type, the correct value should be 0x17
message version is 0x0303 as it's TLS 1.2
message length is 1122, removing preceding IV, offset and MAC verification, message, gets a final length of 1122
seq_number is 1 as it's the first message

HMAC_SHA256 calculation, in python, is as follows:
import hashlib
import hmac
hmac.new(<client_mac>,label+message,hashlib.sha256).digest()

My question is, how do I calculate label?
As RFC mentions, ""+"" denotes concatenation, but concatenation of what

HEX values converted to string


""1"" + ""17"" + ""0303"" + ""462""

INT values converted to strings


""1"" + ""23"" + ""771"" + ""1122""


And other thing to mention, TLSCompressed.version means:

0x0303
771
""1.2""
""12""
""TLS 1.2""

In this maillist (http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg14357.html) I found a supposed clarification of MAC values, 

   MAC(MAC_write_key, seq_num +
       TLSCipherText.type +
       TLSCipherText.version +
       length of ENC(content + padding + padding_length) +
       IV +
       ENC(content + padding + padding_length));

where the length is encoded as two bytes in the usual way.

but it makes no sense to me, because it's useless to re-encode decrypted values to check to compute MAC. And from last line ""where length is encoded as two bytes in the usual way"", does it means that I should use 

struct.pack(""!H"",length)

Then remove ""\x"" and use this value? or should I encode this value in HEX and then concatenate it?
I'm a bit lost, because RFC are not clear about how values should be used.
I've been trying several combinations (even brute forcing), but none of them worked, I hope you can light my way.
","Well, after diggin' a bit I've managed to solve the issue.
RFC 5246, in section 6.2.3.1 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-6.2.3.1) 

The MAC is generated as:
  MAC(MAC_write_key, seq_num +

                        TLSCompressed.length +
                        TLSCompressed.fragment);

where ""+"" denotes concatenation.

But it does not points the data size, either representation format (hex, string...).
The way every field must be represented is as follows:

seq_num:

Description: A int counter, starting in 0, which will be incremented every frame received or sended. For a TCP Session, two seq_numbers must be used, one for the server and other for the client, incrementing everytime each of them sends a frame.
Representation: This value must be represented as Unsigned Long Long with 8 bytes
Representation example: 
struct.pack(""!Q"",seq_num)

TLSCompressed.type

Description: This field is extracted from TLS Record layer (the encrypted payload). For example, if it's an Application Data frame, we must use 0x17.
Representation: This value must be represented as Signed Char, with 2 bytes.
Representation example:
struct.pack(""!b"",TLSCompressed.type)

TLSCompressed.version

Description: This field is also extracted from TLS Record layer (the encrypted payload). For example, if the frame is transferred using TLS 1.2, we must use it's hex representation 0x0303.
Representation: This value must be represented as Unsigned Short, with 2 bytes.
Representation example:
struct.pack(""!H"",TLSCompressed.version)

TLSCompressed.length

Description: This field represents the actual length of the decrypted payload.
Representation: This value must be represented as Unsigned Short, with 2 bytes.
Representation example:
struct.pack(""!H"",TLSCompressed.length)

TLSCompressed.fragment

Description: This field is the actual **decrypted payload.
Representation: This value must be represented as a string


As a python example, the HMAC hashing will be as follows for our previous example:
hmac_digest = hmac.new(mac_secret,'',digestmod=hashlib.sha256)
hmac_digest.update(struct.pack('!QbHH',seq_num,TLSCompressed.type,TLSCompressed.version, len(decrypted)))

So, what doFinal(buffer) do is:
do `update(buffer)` 
calculate the cryptography result
reset the HmacSHA1 instance
return the cryptography result

The doFinal means this is the last(final) step to calculate the result, and there is no more data.
From Java document (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/Mac.html):

byte[] doFinal() Finishes the MAC operation.
byte[] doFinal(byte[] input) Processes the given array of bytes and finishes the MAC operation.

"3653029","HMAC SSL Certificate Question with OAuth","I'm kinda new to this topic so please be gentle ;) I'm attempting to use a 3rd-party Health API called Dossia (http://dossia.org).
I setup a test account and have received my OAuth Consumer Key and Secret, in the config there's a line which says 

define('USER_SIG_METHOD','HMAC-SHA1');

My question is how do I make my server's ""Signature Method"" HMAC-SHA1?
This is just a non-ssl dev box with Fedora, I do have a production box with SSL on it, but I was hoping to get a sandbox post before moving it to production. 
When I curl a post, I get a 404 error and the curl handle's info reads this:
 [ssl_verify_result] => -8179

So I'm assuming this is the issue, I have scoured their wiki, which is found here however the only thing it says about the signature method is that they only support HMAC, do I need to include a certificate like the one on my prod box? Or am I going in completely the wrong direction?
Any advice would help me,
Thank you!
","The signature Method was not the issue here, it was an issue with the record ID needed to be consistent in order to post to the right patient,

","I'm using the python library and had the same issue.  When I spoke to technical support they said the issue was in the way I was calculating the authentication.
Basically you have to include the pagination url as part of the signature.
On the python library at least, you do not have to change the api endpoint since arguments are being delivered as part of the form data.
So you still access for example ""/api/dashboard/closed/"" when getting the second page and the ""?order_by=-closed_at&start_at=2017-10-26+17%3U50%3A49%2B00%9A00"" stuff goes in the form somehow.
The python API does all this for you, you just have to copy the example from the github page.

You have the argument order for the PHP hash_hmac() function wrong.

Ruby:
appsecret = '00916893840fe0a29dfdc261efd3a26a&'
data = 'GET&http%3A%2F%2Fopen.tianya.cn%2Foauth%2Frequest_token.php&oauth_consumer_key%3Dfc69b18eb12bab1e9b35d1093c4de9290516cfdc4%26oauth_nonce%3Dc09e4bf167fbc7eb374b1abb02b5268d%26oauth_signature_method%3DHMAC-SHA1%26oauth_timestamp%3D1366882036%26oauth_version%3D1.0'

digest = OpenSSL::HMAC.digest('sha1', appsecret, data)
Base64.encode64(digest)

PHP:
$appsecret = '00916893840fe0a29dfdc261efd3a26a&';
$data = 'GET&http%3A%2F%2Fopen.tianya.cn%2Foauth%2Frequest_token.php&oauth_consumer_key%3Dfc69b18eb12bab1e9b35d1093c4de9290516cfdc4%26oauth_nonce%3Dc09e4bf167fbc7eb374b1abb02b5268d%26oauth_signature_method%3DHMAC-SHA1%26oauth_timestamp%3D1366882036%26oauth_version%3D1.0';

$digest = hash_hmac('sha1', $data, $appsecret, true);
echo base64_encode($digest);

Both produce hJT2I37mBCo9qISNshKEvhe/at4=. Note, however, that the ruby output also has a trailing new-line, so you will need to normalize this (either remove it in ruby or add one in PHP) if you want to compare them directly.

","When you compare $a and $b, the string inside $b is converted into an integer. Because the value is larger than what PHP can represent as an integer, it gets silently converted into a float instead.  $a is a float. The floats are equal, which is why the compare succeeds.  
hash_hmac converts the float in $a to a string instead of converting the string in $b into an integer which then overflows into a float.  This is why the hashes differ.
If you want the compare to fail so that the behavior between it and hash_hmac is consistent, you'll want to cast $a into a string first or will want to use === to avoid converting data types.

","I'm going to post an answer to my own question, since after combing through Shopify's forums and the rest of SO, I couldn't find anything that would definitively answer this.
At some point, recently, Shopify started including the protocol parameter in the querystring payload. This itself wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that Shopify neglected to mention in their documentation that : and / are not to be URL-encoded when checking the signature. This is completely nonsensical, given that they themselves do URL-encode these characters in the query string that they provide.
So, to fix the issue, just provide the safe parameter to urllib.parse.urlencode with the value :/ (fitting, right?). The full working code looks like this:
params = urllib.parse.parse_qsl(qs)
cleaned_params = []
hmac_value = dict(params)['hmac']

# Sort parameters
for (k, v) in sorted(params):
    if k in ['hmac', 'signature']:
        continue

    cleaned_params.append((k, v))

new_qs = urllib.parse.urlencode(cleaned_params, safe="":/"")
secret = SECRET.encode(""utf8"")
h = hmac.new(secret, msg=new_qs.encode(""utf8""), digestmod=hashlib.sha256)

# Compare digests
hmac.compare_digest(h.hexdigest(), value)

Hope this is helpful for others running into this issue!
Note that this code is somewhat simplified, as the query params are not lexicographically (alphabetically) sorted. If this could be made clearer I can update the code to do that as well.

"38966981","Reading HttpContent bytes fails inside DelegatingHandler when multiple content types present","I'm trying to implement HMAC security for an API. Everything works fine until I try to post data values alongside a file in a MultipartFormDataContent.
The HttpClient DelegatingHandler fails silently when the async line of code to read bytes is hit.
Here's the code building the request:
private FileOutputViewModel GetApiOutput(Uri apiResource, string filename, byte[] file, IDictionary<string, string> extraParameters)
{
    FileOutputViewModel result = new FileOutputViewModel();

    if (file != null)
    {
        using (var content = new MultipartFormDataContent())
        {
            if (extraParameters != null)
            {
                foreach (var param in extraParameters)
                {
                    content.Add(new StringContent(param.Value), param.Key); // <- If I don't have this, everything works fine
                }
            }

            var fileContent = new ByteArrayContent(file);
            fileContent.Headers.ContentDisposition = new ContentDispositionHeaderValue(""attachment"")
            {
                FileName = filename
            };
            content.Add(fileContent);

            var response = HttpClient.PostAsync(apiResource.ToString(), content).Result;

            result.Output = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result);

            result.Filename = Path.GetFileName(filename);
        }
    }

    return result;
}

If I don't use the DelegatingHandler everything works fine, but the HMAC security isn't implemented for the request so is rejected on the API's end.
If I don't add the data values using StringContent items alongside the file then there's no problem reading the bytes. But I'm left with an incomplete request as I need to pass more info along with the file.
The line of code that fails in the DelegatingHandler is indicated below:
private static async Task<byte[]> ComputeHash(HttpContent httpContent)
{
    using (var md5 = MD5.Create())
    {
        byte[] hash = null;
        if (httpContent != null)
        {
            var ms = new MemoryStream();
            await httpContent.CopyToAsync(ms); // <- Fails here
            ms.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);

            var content = ms.ToArray();
            if (content.Length != 0)
            {
                hash = md5.ComputeHash(content);
            }
        }
        return hash;
    }
}

Originally the failing line was:
var content = await httpContent.ReadAsByteArrayAsync();

but this failed with even just the file on its own (previous Stackoverflow question). Using a MemoryStream was one step forward but hasn't got me all the way.
Any ideas how I might be able to work around this issue?
","Seems this was caused by having an async signature for the System.Net.Http.DelegatingHandler.SendAsync method. Originally the delegate override was:
protected async override Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)

when I adapted the code so I could change it to:
protected override Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)

everything started to work as expected.

I chain different streams to ensure Encrypt-then-MAC, later I want to encrypt large files, so this design is necessary.
So if I add the the iv and salt to a stream, with e.g. new MemoryStream(iv).CopyTo(hmacStream); the result will contain this data.

                        using (var plainStream = new MemoryStream(plainData))
                        {
                            plainStream.CopyTo(aesStream);
                        }
                    }
                }
                encryptedBytes = resultStream.ToArray();
            }
            hmacHash = hmacsha512.Hash;
        }

        return new Message {HMAC = hmacHash, Data = encryptedBytes};
    }

    private static AesManaged CreateAesManaged(byte[] iv, byte[] key)
    {
        var aesManaged = new AesManaged
        {
            Mode = CipherMode.CBC,

My temporary solution is to make a second HMACSHA512 calculation at the end.
But this seems not right in any way.
var overallHmac = new HMACSHA512(keyHmac);
hmacHash = overallHmac.ComputeHash(hmacHash.Concat(iv).Concat(saltPassword).Concat(saltHmac).ToArray());

Here is the full sample, search for CreateOverallHmacKey to find the spot.

Within their webhook headers, they provide a header of: X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256
which is: 

Each Webhook request includes a X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header which is generated using the app's shared secret (looks like: '267bb1719a8e6ff75c4f2d709be0ca11'), along with the data sent in the request.

This is jolly wonderful; However, I'm really struggling to calculate the value of the X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256.
I have a .cfm page which the webhook hits and I pass through the getHTTPRequestData to a function like thus:
<cfscript>
variables.stArgs                        = {};
variables.stArgs.stWebHookData          = getHTTPRequestData();
application.stObj.stShopify.oShopifyWebHookBusiness.receiveWebHook(argumentCollection=variables.stArgs);
</cfscript>

I then stole some code from StackOverflow and Ben Nadel, but neither seem to end up giving me the value that I want.  Currently I'm using Ben Nadels code like thus:
local.data = arguments.stWebHookData.toString();
local.macClass = createObject( ""java"", ""javax.crypto.Mac"" );
local.secretkeySpec = createObject( ""java"", ""javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec"" ).init(toBinary(toBase64(arguments.key)),'HmacSHA256');
local.mac = local.macClass.getInstance('HmacSHA256');
local.mac.init(local.secretkeySpec );

local.hashedBytes = local.mac.doFinal(toBinary(toBase64(local.data)));
return lcase( binaryEncode( local.hashedBytes, ""base64"" ) );

(arguments.key is the shared secret)
Somewhere along the way, I am going wrong.  Have I completely misunderstood what I am meant to be doing.  This looks so easy in PHP.
","So, getHTTPRequestData() returns a struct with a number of members. The one we're interested is content, which will be a byte array. 
The MAC classes' doFinal() method  expects an array of bytes (in our case the HTTP request's content) and returns an array of bytes (the HMac of the content)
The returned byte array needs to be base-64 encoded in order to compare it to the one Shopify puts in the webhook's headers. toBase64() will do that for us. 
Putting it all together, you get this:
toBase64(local.mac.doFinal(getHTTPRequestData().content))

I am considering two approaches:

User's access token contains both the required user information and time period (aes encrypted). The token is passed in Authorization header in every request. Server decrypts the token and gets all the information from it.
User's access token has the same information hashed (with HMAC). Authorization header contains both the token and the required user information (ID, role, maybe username). Server hashes user's information together with the current period using the same secret and compares with the passed token. If they are equal the access is granted.

Which approach is more secure (I feel the 2nd) and more common (probably the 1st)?
If you think the approach 2 is better, is it maybe better to pass user's information in a separate header?

It seems like HMAC authentication relies on a private key which is used to generate a hash on the client side and used to re-create the same hash on the server-side for comparison. 
But this raises the question of how the client knows the secret key. It would either have to be sent over the wire when the user logs in - or it would need to be already present in the client application. 
It seems that if it gets sent over the wire on login - this opens up a security hole. But if it is already present in the client (a Backbone app in this case) someone could easily find it in the code. 
My next question would be, if the secret key is not supposed to be sent over the wire, then how would it get to the client in the first place and be secure?

"22297560","How to implement HMAC-SHA authentication from scratch?","I would like to implement authentication for a web app api using a similar technique to the AWS Signature Process. The server will render html for user web browser clients. The app will also return json for non-browser clients (iphone, android, blackberry, ipad, etc.) I am trying to write authentication code that will allow a single user to be signed (remembered) in to the app from multiple clients. Logging out from any one client should not revoke the token/cookie for all the other clients. 

When a user sign up or logs in, how does a client (native mobile client or web browser especially) get the private/secret key? My understanding is the key should not be sent over a network? Can it just be sent over ssl?
For browser clients is the private key stored in a cookie or in some other form of local storage?? I.e. for generic api token authentication would the token be stored in a cookie on the browser and in a db on the phone 
When the client is a browser, how does it sign a request signature with private key? i.e. generate a hash of the id + private key + request. For native mobile clients or server to server communication I believe there are libraries that can be used to generate a signed request. When the request originates from a browser how does this work?
If a user is required to be remembered on multiple clients (tablet, iphone, work computer, home laptop, etc.) would the user need to have a set of private keys/tokens for each client? 

I would have used Devise with Rails but it requires you to write your own token authentication code.
I am also looking at OAuth, which questions 2 and 4 both apply to, but would really like to investigate the AWS method.
","You start with a solution (HMAC) but I do not think your ""problem"" fits your solution :).
I'll try to answer this to the best of my knowledge.

To my understanding ,a private key would be derived of a public key that is shared. Or you could share a private key, but only if authentication is already established (in other words: you already know for sure who you are talking to) and the connection is secured (encrypted). You still will be vulnerable to man in the middle attacks though.
I'm not sure. A cookie is not secure. Steal the cookie, steal the private key. My preference would be a locally stored key(file or storage), encrypted by a password.
You would have to devise some sort of a client side library (in javascript or something like it).
Yes.

Why share keys when you could share a token, like oAuth implements. The token is generated by your application and is valid for a limited time. This way you share access, but not the means to aquire access to your application. You login with username and password (or keyfile) and you get a token that grants you access untill the token is revoked.

But it returns a completely different result. If I pass the masterKey directly into the javascript hmac, and pass it in as a string into the CCHmac method in Swift, it all works; so it seems to be something to do with finding the equivalent to this:-

","Ok, I got this after 22 hours of study/google.

Spoiler Alert
Since this is one of pentesterlab's pro exercises, I'll not post the code demonstrating how to generate a full JWT using HSA256. 
Instead, it'd be better if I post how to do calculate the HSA256 using a pem file in python, as it was my original question:
import hashlib
import hmac

key = open(""public_cert.pem"",""r"").read()
signature = hmac.new(key, unsignedToken, digestmod=hashlib.sha256).digest()
print signature

Basically we just need to read the public key file and use the hmac.new(..) function, setting hashlib.sha256 as the digest to be used.
The ""unsignedToken"" is the JWT text (or declarations) that we wanted to calculate the signature.
For those still trying to figure it out how to create a valid JWT for pentesterlab's exercise, the only hint I can give is to urlsafe-base64 encode everything.
There is also a python module, named ""pyjwt"" that can be used, but its source code must be edited to allow public keys to be used as a HMAC key.

","In case any one found this question. The answer provided by the host works, but the idea is wrong. You don't use any RSA keys with HMAC method. The RSA key pair (public and private) are used for asymmetric algorithm while HMAC is symmetric algorithm.
In HMAC, the two sides of the communication keep the same secret text(bytes) as the key. It can be a public_cert.pem as long as you keep it secretly. But a public.pem is usually shared publicly, which makes it unsafe.

I'm using a secret key and a Twitch user ID which I've stored in a customer tag.
The hash value is passed as a query parameter to my app, which uses the crypto module in node.js to generate a hash and compare it with the hash from the url.
Things get strange here: In the .liquid file, when I type the Twitch ID directly into the string filter, the hash value generated by the .liquid file is the same value my app generates, and everything looks good:
{{ ""12345678""  | hmac_sha256: ""secret_key"" }}
However, when I pass the same Twitch ID as a variable into the string filter, the hash value the liquid file generates is different than the first time:
{{ twitchId  | hmac_sha256: ""secret_key"" }}
I've already tried removing whitespace and newline characters from the Twitch ID variable just in case there were any. I don't even have a guess as to what the problem could be. Maybe the variable (which is a string) is encoded differently than when I type it in directly?
For reference, the javascript code checking for matching hashes:
    // Get query string params:
    const { hash, twitchId } = req.query;

    }

","You need to show how you are assigning the ID to the variable. Without seeing that, there is no way to validate your question.
I did a quick test, and proved I get the same HMAC with a string and a variable, so it must be that you are doing something weird in your assignment:

I guess I wrongly assumed the theme.liquid file is loaded before the file in my response to Shopify. I assumed this because javascript variables I instantiate in my theme.liquid file are available in my response liquid file (I think this has something to do with liquid variables being created server-side and javascript variables being created client-side).
I am now instantiating the twitchId variable in my response liquid file. So that solved it.

One of my top concerns now is securing the WebAPI against invalid calls to my API.  
I am looking at the HMAC approach where I share unique keys with different authorized web apps that can call my API.  
My question is,
Assuming I share Key A with WebApp A and Key B with WebApp B, can the developer of WebApp A use Key A with his another WebApp C to gain access to my API and make 'authorized' calls? The key shared to them is susceptible to abuse in other applications.
","Of course, your keys could be used everywhere. In general, HMAC approach is designed to authenticate messages. In other words, when you are using HMAC, you are 100% sure, that the key owner (except scenario when key was compromised) has sent you a request. Nothing can stop key-owner from sharing this key. But, the main thing is, that from perspective of your ""host""-API, all the requests signed with particular key should be considered as the same client, independently of are they physically the same application or not.

"37804770","ASP.NET WebApi Security: Confusions with HMAC, OAuth, IdentityServer, Auth0","I trying to build an application which uses the webapi 2 and 
angular js 1 at the front end. I have been researching
the security aspects especially token based security. 
I could find a lot of things and it's really confusing what to implement like: 
OAuth, IdentityServer, HMAC and also Auth0. 
I checked on HMAC and consumed the webapi through the console application.
However, I have not been able to find the project where webapi is consumed by 
JS based frameworks in the front end (like angular). There are typically console applications with lots of codes. I wonder how am I suppose to do this using Angular js?
I checked on the IdentityServer and found its learning curve bit frustrating for a newbie like me. I have the existing db with the existing users and roles tables. Instead of using default tables provided by Identity, I would like to use my own and write my own authentication logic. But I am not being able to find the resources for these too. 
Now I could see an Auth0. Now before diving in I would like to make 
sure if it is the advisable authentication and authorization framework 
for webapi.
As I have been asked to implement Token based authentication in the project.
I am having hard times figuring out the right approach and the easiest way to do. I have wasted a week and still confused what shall I implement. So, If you have any resources where the webapi security has been performed in an elegant way, please help me out.
","First of all, I would not recommend using HMAC to secure your API. If your private key is compromised. That means an intruder can access your services easily!
IdentityServer4 and Auth0 both work as authentication & authorization framework(Oauth2 and OpenID connect framework). You can also utilize SMAL, WS-federation etc.  
If you approach Identityserver4, you need to maintain the server by yourself. It also involves you need to have an intermediate level of knowledge of Oauth2.0 & OpenID connect protocols. If you are thinking of production application, that means, you also need to host the identityserver4. 
Moving to  auth0, they provide the whole authentication & authorization out of the box including Social IDP. You just need to navigate through their dashboard to create the application and resources etc. You can use the generous free tier if you don't have a lot of requirements. 
Regarding the security, both Auth0 and Identityserver4 are the great and elegant way to secure your resource(API) and applications. 
The following architecture should work for both Identityserver4 and Auth0:

Your frontend application will redirect the user to /authorize endpoint to authenticate the user( Executing Implicit Grant flow). 


      GET /authorize?
            client_id=[Client id]&
            scope=[Scopes]&
            response_type=[Response types]&
            audience=[API Identifier]&
            redirect_uri=[Redirect URI]&
            state=abc&
            nonce=xyz

http://docs.identityserver.io/en/latest/endpoints/authorize.html
https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/tutorials/implicit-grant
As a result of successful authentication, you application receives idToken and Access token. 

Use the access token as authorization header when making HTTP request from your front-end application to the web API endpoint. 
In your API server, validate the token and return the resources. You can use the ASPNET CORE authentication middleware to validate the token.

Generate SHA256 with an Onlineconverter:
I suppose the Problem is the LF. The Onlineconverter maybe have problem with it. Maybe they use CRLF. Better don't try to check your SHA256 with Onlineconverters.

Generate base64 with an Onlineconverter:
The SHA256 Scratchpad shows is not the value you convert with base64. You have to convert the Hex-Value of the SHA256.

Query to sign with GET:
If you want to use GET, the query to sign has to look like the query to sign for POST. Also the four lines. Only swap POST with GET.

So, kDate I get is correct. kRegion is not correct as I get the value:

I have tried using this website to calculate the HMAC (hmac generator) and I get the same result.

I really wonder if the page is wrong. Can anyone explain if it's my fault or AWS fault?
Thank you

You should understand the values are binary and printed in hexadecimal form
You are passing date in hexadecimal. You should convert it to binary and pass it before calling hash_hmac. Or store it in binary and print the same in hexadecimal
You never mentioned the language you are using. I had to google to find out what language you are using. In PHP, you can pass: $raw_output = true to get the binary string
Store the strings n binary and convert them to hex before printing.

Since I am not familiar with PHP, I tried the same in Python and the output matched the expected output. See how I convert it to hex and print.
import hmac
import hashlib
from base64 import b16encode as b16

def sign(key, msg):
    return hmac.new(key, msg.encode(""utf-8""), hashlib.sha256).digest()

def getSignatureKey(key, dateStamp, regionName, serviceName):
    kDate = sign((""AWS4"" + key).encode(""utf-8""), dateStamp)
    print b16(kDate)
    kRegion = sign(kDate, regionName)
    print b16(kRegion)
    kService = sign(kRegion, serviceName)
    print b16(kService)
    kSigning = sign(kService, ""aws4_request"")
    print b16(kSigning)
    return kSigning

key = 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY'
dateStamp = '20120215'
regionName = 'us-east-1'
serviceName = 'iam'

getSignatureKey(key, dateStamp, regionName, serviceName)

I've read a lot about OAuth, SAML, JWT, HMAC etc. and everytime I see author emphasizes that OAuth is not authentication and you need to differ authN from authZ. I'm a bit confusing because I don't understand:

when I need to use authentication (SSO, login/password) and when authorization(OAuth, tokens) for API?
are HMAC, JWT for authorization or for authentication? because they are signed and I can add userid to this token use like user identifier
what are real differences between authN workflow and authZ workflow?

","OAuth can be also used to authenticate users using a resource owner grant (i.e. a client gets an access token providing an user+password credential). 
The resulting access token is what you should call authorization, since it will contain info like claims describing permissions, permission masks or roles (it depends on what authorization scheme you implement in your solution).
A JWT (JSON Web Token) is just a JSON representation of both access token and any other associated info. JWT is the content of some authentication result which can be used to be authorized against some resources. Since the JWT contains an access token, if you're using basic authorization, you'll add an Authorization header to your requests: Authorization: Bearer [your access token].

"48430211","Python HMAC to CryptoJS","My question is very similar to Translation from Python to JavaScript: HMAC-SHA256, however that question was never answered.
The following Python code produces the correct hash:
def sign_api_request(api_secret, api_key, method, url):
    encoded_url = urllib.parse.quote(url.lower(), '').lower()
    timestamp = int(time.time())print(""timestamp: "" + str(timestamp))
    nonce = str(uuid.uuid4())

    signature = api_key + method + encoded_url + str(timestamp) + nonce

    secret_bytes = base64.b64decode(api_secret)

    signature_bytes = signature.encode('UTF8')

    signature_hash = hmac.new(secret_bytes, signature_bytes, hashlib.sha256).digest()
    base64_signature_hash = base64.b64encode(signature_hash).decode()

    print(base64_signature_hash)

I'm trying to generate the same hash string using Javascript (as a Postman pre-request script). Here's what I've got:
function epochTime() {
    var d = new Date();
    var t = d.getTime();
    var o = t + """";
    return o.substring(0, 10);
}

function newGuid() {
    return 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'.replace(/[xy]/g, function (c) { var r = Math.random() * 16 | 0, v = c == 'x' ? r : r & 0x3 | 0x8; return v.toString(16); });
}

var uri_path = encodeURIComponent(request.url.toLowerCase()).toLowerCase();
var payload = uri_path; //.toLowerCase();

timestamp = epochTime();
nonce = newGuid();
signature = environment.api_key + ""GET"" + payload + timestamp + nonce;

secret_bytes = atob(environment.api_secret);

var hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(signature, secret_bytes);
var hashInBase64 = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(hash);
var sig = ""amx "" + environment.api_key + "":"" + hashInBase64 + "":"" + nonce + "":"" + timestamp;
postman.setGlobalVariable(""signature"", sig);

If I use the same timestamp and nonce (by setting them explicitly rather than generating them at runtime) and the same api_key and api_secret (which are constant across calls) I expect to get the same value in sig (Javascript) as I do in base64_signature_hash (Python), however that's not the case.
I understand that this might be an encoding problem, but my js-fu is weak. Any ideas?
Edit to add: the method and url used for each are also the same.
","Basically, there are two issues. First, in both Python and JS code secret_bytes should be base64 encoded string. Second, in JavaScript code secret_bytes was not correctly decoded from base64 string. Please find below corrected Python and JavaScript examples.

    timestamp = str(1569158586);
    nonce = '708b7df1-7494-49fa-812c-e5f6c24aeab6'

    signature = api_key + method + encoded_url + timestamp + nonce
    # print(signature)

    secret_bytes = base64.standard_b64decode(api_secret)
    # print(secret_bytes)

    signature_bytes = signature.encode('UTF8')

    signature_hash = hmac.new(secret_bytes, signature_bytes, hashlib.sha256).digest()
    base64_signature_hash = base64.b64encode(signature_hash).decode()

@pvg there was no any spelling mistakes.. if I just use {$totalAmount} in the $data it did not work.. but this needed this : FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT

"6671926","Using an HMAC on an a already hashed value, good or bad practice?","Hi all I have a question on if this is good practice or not.  I am aware that simply double hashing a value can be bad for various reasons.
What I would like to do would be something like this, in php.
$val = hash_hmac('sha256', md5($password), $salt);

The reason for this is that we are authenticating with a trusted partner over a closed api.  The passwords are stored as an MD5 hash in our DB.  However, I don't want our partner to send this same value across the net.
This way I can compare the md5'd password inside our database to unique hash that our partner has sent.
What say ye?
","First of all, is this a user password (ie, you are authenticating on-behalf-of a user), or a shared secret between your two servers?
If it's a user password, stop. You are saving passwords in plaintext (or as an unsalted md5). Either way is bad. Save passwords as a salted hash and use OAuth or something to authenticate instead.
If it's a shared secret between two servers (not representing a user), you can still use oauth or something, but if you just want something simple, you should authenticate like this:
$val = hash_hmac('sha256', $nonce, $secret);

$nonce is a one-time-value chosen by the server randomly to prevent replay attacks.
Keep in mind that if you don't have a nonce, then whatever value you send across is your shared secret. It doesn't matter if you derive it from a hmac of a md5 or whatever; if it ends up being the same each time, it is equivalent to a password sent across the communications channel. And remember to secure the communications channel from MITMs as well!

function multipartFormData(params, url, key, nonce, signature) {
var boundary = '----WebKitFormBoundary' + nonce;
var bodyString = [];

bodyString.push(
'--' + boundary,
'Content-Disposition: form-data; name=""document""; filename=""image.png""',
'Content-Type: image/png',
'',
fs.createReadStream('image/image.png')
  );

  bodyString.push('--' + boundary + '--','');

  var content = bodyString.join('\r\n');

  return {
    formData: content,
    url: url + '/',
    headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data; boundary=' + boundary,

    'Apiauth-Nonce': nonce,
    'Apiauth-Signature': signature,
    'Content-Length': content.length

  }
}

There are the signature hash authentication key: 
function getMessageSignature(path, params, nonce) {
    var data_params = params;
    var boundary = '----WebKitFormBoundary' + nonce;
    var postParameters  = querystring.stringify(data_params);
    var path = '/api' + path + '/';

    var auth_hash = crypto.createHmac(""sha256"", config.secret).update(message).digest('hex').toUpperCase();
    return auth_hash;
}

So then I just do my request:
function Client(key, secret) {
    var nonce = new Date() * 1000;
    var config = {
        url: 'https://somesite/api',

// there is other all functions, 2 of them i have already written on top

    var signature = getMessageSignature(path, params, nonce);
    var options = multipartFormData(params, config.url, config.key, nonce, signature);

    request.post(options, function(error, response, body) {

"46147441","How to combine HMAC with AES for (python) client-server messenger?","So I am trying to write a small encrypted command line IM messenger which accepts two keys as args. I am not sure how the two keys are meant to work together or which is for what. I am trying to use HMAC and AES together but am unsure of how. 
Please note this is for educational purposes only, I do not intend to try to use this anywhere else. I am having a hard time understanding and any advice or explanations would be so greatly appreciated. I have a working IM messenger already up and running, I need only to figure out the HMAC/AES/keys.
Thank you all,
       ~Maddie
","What you should be doing is using the Encrypt-Then-MAC paradigm. 
That means, you are first using the first key to encrypt the message with AES.
Afterwards, you use the second key as an authentication key for the HMAC-SHA256 function to authenticate the ciphertext (the output of the encryption function). Then you concatenate the ciphertext and the HMAC output (called a tag) and transmit it over the wire.
Upon receiving such a message you recalulate the tag from the ciphertext and compare it to the one tranferred. If it is valid, you may decrypt the ciphertext.
Final note: You do not really need to use to seperate keys as an input parameter. If would be fine to just supply one master key and than use that to derive to seperate encryption- and authenctication-keys using a key derivation function like HKDF.

","I'm not sure if this is the source of your problem, but you should use request.raw_post instead of param_hash.to_json. The request body is a json object and there is no canonical ordering of attributes on a json object. When you convert the param hash back to json, there's no guarantee that the attributes are in the same order as in the original request body.
Try again using

"39456369","Check for errors in TLS implementation","I'm developing a small TLS client, which is used together with SMTP. The handshake is working well until my client sends the encrypted finished message. So Client Hello, Server Hello, Certificate, Server Hello Done, Client Key Exchange and Change Cipher Spec are working. As chiper suite I'm using TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256.
My problem is, that I receive the ""Bad Record MAC"" alert from the server after sending the finished message. But I have no idea where I can start to search for the error. I've double checked all my functions and readed the RFC twice.
In my opionion one of the following points can cause the ""Bad Record MAC"" alert:

The master-secret is wrong.
The client_write_MAC_key is wrong.
The client_write_encryption_key is wrong.
The P_hash function is wrong.
The PRF function is wrong.
The MAC function is wrong.
The AES encryption doesn't work correctly.
The hash of the Finished Message is wrong.

Has anyone an idea what I can do to find the issue. Are there any tools to check if the master-secret, MAC and key calculations are correct? Or is it possible to decrypt the content with Wireshark? Note that I'm not having the private key of the server.
","I've setted up an local test server with OpenSSL as Steffen Ullrich suggested. I've done a detailed analytics of the ""debug output"" which was provided by Wireshark.
I was able to solve a problem with my padding. But I'm still getting a Bad Record MAC alert. Like the debug output says, the MAC is incorrect (message ssl_decrypt_record: mac failed).
Some more information about the connection and the debug output:

The pre-master-secret, master-secret and all the keys (client write MAC key, server write MAC key, client write key, server write key, client write IV, server write IV) are correct. I've compared these from my software with them of the debug output. So everything until the Encrypted Finished Message is correct.
The server / Wireshark can decrypt the Encrypted Finished Message successfuly.
The server / Wireshark detects the padding correctly.
The server / Wireshark ""skips"" the IV and only shows the Finished Message and the MAC in the line Plaintext[64]:

In my opinion only two things can cause this error:

The MAC is calculated wrong.
The hash (verify_data) from the handshake messages are wrong.

My Encrypted Finished Message has a full length of 80 bytes and the following structure:
struct
{
    // TLS record
    ContentType type;
    ProtocolVersion version;
    uint16 length;
    // TLS handshake and content (encrypted)
    uint8 IV[16];
    struct
    {
        HandshakeType msg_type;
        uint24 length;
        uint8 verify_data[12];
    } content;
    uint8 MAC[32];
    uint8 padding[15];
    uint8 paddingLength;
} FinishedMessage;

The content looks for example like the following:
     00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f
0000 16 03 03 00 50 XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX
0010 XX XX XX XX XX 14 00 00 0C YY YY YY YY YY YY YY
0020 YY YY YY YY YY ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ
0030 ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ
0040 ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ ZZ 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F
0050 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F

Where XX represents the randomly generated IV and YY the verify_data and ZZ the MAC of the message like described in the RFC.
The verify_data contains the first 12 bytes of the SHA-256 hash. The hash is computed by the messages Client Hello, Server Hello, Certificate (from Server), Server Hello Done and Client Key Exchange. For hashing the full messages without the record header (first 5 bytes) are used.
The MAC is computed by the client write MAC key and the message. As sequence number the number 0 is used. The fragment which is used for calculating the MAC only contains the msg_type, length and verify_data (see structure content above).
Has anyone an idea how I can find what is wrong with my MAC?

I tried googling around but did not get anything. In this Java code, I am passing URI and Key as arguments, to generate the hash code, where URI contains Timestamp. 
The java code is as :
    public static String calcMAC(String data, byte[] key) throws Exception {
    String result=null;
    SecretKeySpec signKey = new SecretKeySpec(key, SecurityConstants.HMAC_SHA1_ALGORITHM);
    Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(SecurityConstants.HMAC_SHA1_ALGORITHM);
    mac.init(signKey);
    byte[] rawHmac;
    try {
        rawHmac = mac.doFinal(data.getBytes(""US-ASCII""));
        result = Base64.encodeBase64String(rawHmac);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return result.trim();
}

public static void main(String args[]) {
    String timestamp = args[0];
    String key = ""d134hjeefcgkahvg32ajkdbaff84ff180"";
    String out = null;
    try {
        out = calcMAC(""/req?app_id=47ca34"" + timestamp + ""=2018-05-22T12:02:15Z"", 
                key.getBytes());
        System.out.println(URLEncoder.encode(out, ""UTF-8""));
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}

Is it possible to achieve the same goal in NodeJs/JavaScript?
Note:: I have to call this script from Postman pre-request script.
","The crypto module should do this for you, you can substitute the 'data' variable with whatever you want to hash: 
const crypto = require('crypto');

const data = 'The fault dear Brutus lies not in our stars';
const key = Buffer.from('d134hjeefcgkahvg32ajkdbaff84ff180', 'utf8');

const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha1', key).update(data).digest('base64');
const uriEncodedHash = encodeURIComponent(hash);
console.log('Hash: ' + uriEncodedHash);

Hashing the data in both Java and Node.js gives me the result (URI Encoded) of:
TJJ3xj93m8bfVpGoucluMQqkB0o%3D

The same Java code would be:
public static void main(String args[]) {
    String data = ""The fault dear Brutus lies not in our stars"";
    String key = ""d134hjeefcgkahvg32ajkdbaff84ff180"";
    String out = null;
    try {
        out = calcMAC(data, key.getBytes());
        System.out.println(URLEncoder.encode(out, ""UTF-8""));
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}

Again, we can put anything into 'data' we want.

PS: I've looked through both, the Embedded Apps API (but I can't figure out if that's even the right documentation or if I'm doing something wrong), as well as the GitHub example provided (which has no instructions on how to verify an Embedded App admin page visit).
UPDATE:
I've tried various other ways, discovering some ridiculous problems along the way, but still no luck.  

The method I understand should be used to verify a Shopify HMAC is something akin to this:
function verify_hmac($hmac = NULL, $shopify_app_api_secret) {
    $params_array = array();
    $hmac = $hmac ? $hmac : $_GET['hmac'];
    unset($_GET['hmac']);

    foreach($_GET as $key => $value){
        $key = str_replace(""%"",""%25"",$key);
        $key = str_replace(""&"",""%26"",$key);
        $key = str_replace(""="",""%3D"",$key);
        $value = str_replace(""%"",""%25"",$value);
        $value = str_replace(""&"",""%26"",$value);
        $params_array[] = $key . ""="" . $value;
    }

    $params_string = join('&', $params_array);
    $computed_hmac = hash_hmac('sha256', $params_string, $shopify_app_api_secret);

    return hash_equals($hmac, $computed_hmac);
}


But the line $params_string = join('&', $params_array); causes an annoying problem by encoding &timestamp as xtamp ... Using http_build_query($params_array) results in the same ridiculous thing.  Found others having this same problem here.  Basically resolved by encoding the & as &amp;, to arrive at $params_string = join('&amp;', $params_array);.

My final version is like this, but still doesn't work (all the commented code is what else I've tried to no avail):  
function verify_hmac($hmac = NULL, $shopify_app_api_secret) {
    $params_array = array();
    $hmac = $hmac ? $hmac : $_GET['hmac'];

","If you get a hit from Shopify, the first thing you do is check in your persistence layer if you have the shop registered. If you do, and you have a session of some kind setup, you are free to render your App to that shop. If you do not have the shop persisted, you go through the oAuth cycle to get an authentication token to use on the shop, which you persist along with the shop and new session.
For any routes or end points in your shop where you are receiving webhooks, of course those requests have no session, so you use the HMAC security approach to figure out what to do. So your question is clearly straddling two different concepts, each handled differently. The documentation is pretty clear on the differences.

The one that is technically working is the Python script and although I get results from PHP script, the hex returned is incorrect.
UPDATE -- one thing i'v noticed is if i am using a single line for the data then the results are identical. The mismatch seems to occur when there is multi-line data.

"53662669","Bittrex API Invalid Signature Response With Python","I am trying to view my open orders through the Bittrex API but all I get is an INVALID_SIGNATURE response.
I'm using Python 3.6. Here is my code:
import time

import requests

apikey = '12345'
apisecret = '56789'

nonce = str(time.time())

url = 'https://bittrex.com/api/v1.1/market/getopenorders?&apikey=' + apikey + '&nonce=' + nonce

signature = hmac.new(apisecret.encode(), url.encode(), hashlib.sha512).hexdigest()
hdrs = {'apisign' : signature}

r = requests.get(url, headers = hdrs)
print(r.json())

I'm expecting a response like:
{
    ""success"" : true,
    ""message"" : """",
    ""result"" : [{
            ""Uuid"" : null,
            ""OrderUuid"" : ""09aa5bb6-8232-41aa-9b78-a5a1093e0211"",

                …
        }
    ]
}

But instead I get:
{'success': False, 'message': 'INVALID_SIGNATURE', 'result': None}

I know my keys are correct, and using purposely incorrect keys changes the INVALID_SIGNATURE response to 
APIKEY_INVALID. I've tried to pull other information such as ""getbalance"", ""getorderhistory"", etc., but they all give the same result.
I've found many variations of the code above, but each one I try ends with the same result. I'm sure I'm just missing something simple but after a week of searching, I still don't know why it isn't working.
Any insight is appreciated.
Thanks.

","HMAC computes a hash from a secret and the data you want to authenticate. In order for two servers to compute the same HMAC they'll have to share the secret, which possibly makes it not that secret. In order too be able to verify old password the secret will need either to be fixed or to be somehow referenced along the stored password if it can changes, making it practically a salt.
Using HMAC in a password storage setting is pretty odd, it's not a proper password derivation function (way too fast, not memory intensive enough) and the secret don't bring much value if any, seeing it must be fixed (unlike proper HMAC usage where the secret is agreed upon by the communicating parties for a session and forgotten about after).

"45230971","how do I sync user token in multi dispatcher setting","Seeking your advise on best practice on the below two use cases :
1st Use case:
I have set up of two Dispatchers (D1 and D2)and two publishers(P1 and P2) with TarMK. D1 always send requests to P1 and D2 always send requests to P2. Load balancer sends request to either D1 or D2.
2nd User case:
I've another setup where D1 can send request either P1 or P2 and D2 can send request either P1 or P2. Load balancer sends request to either D1 or D2.
In this application user token is created on user successful authentication. This token is created based on key located at /etc/key. The key located under /etc/key is different for both P1 and P2. 
Given this set-up, a user is logged in to P1 and if P1 goes down then 
1)How can I redirect user to P2 without asking user to login. 
2)How can I replicate user token to P2? 
I do not want to use revers replication. What is the best practice of such design? Do I need to keep same key /etc/key in both P1 and P2? 
","
Do I need to keep same key /etc/key in both P1 and P2?

Short answer: Yes
Details
AEM uses Encapsulated Tokens to support authenticated users across publisher farms. 
Both of your scenarios to use one dispatcher per publisher or cluster publishers across each dispatcher should work in case of failure if you follow the recommendation of synchronising the HMAC key across all your publishers in the cluster.
This can be achieved by following the instructions here
AEM is designed around stateless authentication but the token needs to be encrypted and decrypted by same HMAC key which is stored under /etc/key path. Unless you synchronise these keys, there is no way for one instance to understand the token from another instance. This is a design/feature of AEM authentication.

Currently I get accurate data if message = """" but so far any non-empty query parameters return a 403 error. The API documentation asks for parameters to be formatted as ""customerCode=XXX"" and  I've been able to produce valid queries in the API Sandbox. I assume the problem is somewhere in the getSignature function, but I've rewritten it a few ways and .encode() or bytes() gives me the same result. If the code looks coherent and it's a syntax error on my end I can reach out to the support team. Again, when message is an empty string I get valid results back so I'm puzzled. Error occurs on all tested Report pages with multiple different query parameters tested per page. Relevant import functions are not pasted here but are included in the code.

","EDIT: I just noticed that message is only being used for the signature, and is not being included in the request.  I think you probably need something like data = requests.get(url + report, data=message, headers=headers).
Old, almost certainly incorrect theory is below:
Since it works for an empty message, my guess is that it has to do with the byte encoding of the message.  The utf-16 or utf-32 encodings of the empty message will be the same as the utf-8, but they will differ for non-empty messages.
So perhaps try message.encode('utf-16') or message.encode('utf-32')?  The API docs should describe this detail of how auth is done.
Is it possible to link to the docs for the API, or is it internal?

","Assuming that you are dealing with two strings of the same length (e.g., HMACs) then you can just apply a comparison to each character and accumulate the result:

","The Objective-C method
+ (NSString *)calculateWithAlgorithm:(HMACAlgorithm)algorithm forKey:(NSString*)key andData:(NSString *)data;

is exposed to Swift as
class func calculateWithAlgorithm(algorithm: HMACAlgorithm, forKey key: String!, andData data: String!) -> String!

It returns an (implicitly unwrapped) optional string because the NSString returned by the Objective-C method may be nil. 
Converting the return value to a String in
let signature : String = BGHMAC.calculateWithAlgorithm(...)

causes a runtime exception if the return value is nil (""no value""). You should therefore test the return value
before using it:
let signature : String! = TBGHMAC.calculateWithAlgorithm(HMACAlgorithm.SHA256, forKey: key, andData: data)
if signature {
    println(signature)
} else {
    println(""failed"")
}

But why does calculateWithAlgorithm() return nil? The problem is here:
NSString* returnStr = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:hmacBytes encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

A message digest is a quite arbitrary sequence of bytes, and cannot be interpreted
as an UTF-8 string, therefore returnStr is nil.
To solve your problem, you could for example convert the message digest to
a string using the Base64 encoding:
NSString* returnStr = [hmacBytes base64EncodedStringWithOptions:0];

The CommonCrypto library has been properly added with an objectiveC bridging file, and printing the result gives me a proper hashed signature.
I've contacted coinspot but they are swarmed with requests and they only have a cookie template response in regards to any technical support for their API.
Here's the Alamofire segment I placed under a function to call any command to the coinspot server:
    func request(_ command: Router, params: [String: AnyObject]?, completion: @escaping (Result<JSON>)-> Void){
        var parameters = [""nonce"": Int(Date().timeIntervalSince1970*1000) as AnyObject]
        if params != nil{
            parameters = parameters + params!
        }
let sign = customerSecret.sha512
        print(sign)
        let headers:HTTPHeaders = [""key"": APIKey, ""sign"": sign]
        do{
            try Alamofire.request( command.asURL(), method: .post, parameters: parameters, encoding: JSONEncoding.default, headers: headers).responseJSON{(response) in
                guard let json = response.result.value else {
                    completion(.failure(CoinSpotError.networkError(error: response.result.error)))
                    return
                }
                print(response)
            }
        } catch {
            print(""error"")
        }
    }

I think the above is correct. Router is just a set of addresses that call to the proper POST request for retrieving data.
Finally, I've changed the request to GET, got rid of both headers and parameters, and I get a status ok and the resulting JSON. I figured I'll just try a command on a browser and it worked, 
The API does say every request must be a post method. 
","Coinspot API is down, with no ETA: Coinbase API down
I continue to receive {'status': 'invalid'} back from any request I make.
Their publicapi is still up, albeit only for BTC, LTC, and DOGE.

"23682343","How secure is JavaScript based HMAC?","I am currently architecting a new SaaS based application which will include a RESTful API.  I want to secure the communications between the Browser and API Server. To do this I plan on using a ""Two Legged"" OAuth approach.  My question is how secure can this approach be if I am encrypting in the browser using JavaScript HMAC library?  Wouldn't this approach expose the secret key?
","General observations about client-side Javascript based ""security"":

anything you do on the client in Javascript is entirely visible to said client; you cannot hide anything from the user
yes, if you're sending out private keys to the client in Javascript, they cease to be private keys
anything happening client side cannot be trusted, at all; you don't even have any proof that the client is running your code, all you see is the result of it
if you're trying to do some client-side magic to protect from third parties: a third party in a position to do any harm is typically also in the position to intercept all the Javascript that your server is sending to the client in the first place...
if you're protecting the transport of said Javascript from said third parties by using SSL... you don't need any more client-side Javascript code to add any more protection to that channel

Beyond this, I'm not entirely sure who is supposed to authenticate against whom here and what you want to keep secret from whom; but hopefully these points will get you thinking.

","The bug is simple. The ipad and opad need to be (input) block size in length, not the length of the digest output. I.e. they must be 512 bits (64 bytes) for SHA-1, not 20.
I.e. 
#define INPUT_BLOCK_SIZE 64
byte derivedKey[64] =  {0x42,0xA9,0x78,0x90,0xFC,0xE5,0x16,0x8E,0x58,0x12,

// null-padded on the right

and then change the DIGESTSIZE to INPUT_BLOCK_SIZE for wherever the length of ipad, opad is needed.
Result:
4303E965D88D288C9AC594CE6C5E6AFF27D40B2D

From Wikipedia

K' is another secret key, derived from the original key K (by padding K to the right with extra zeroes to the input block size of the hash function, or by hashing K if it is longer than that block size)

(emphasis mine).

P.S. It would be better to use the SHA1_Init/Update/Final, as then lots of copying would be skipped. You can also avoid allocating memory for the ipad and opad separately by first calculating ipad and after it has been used, then xorring in place by 0x6a to get the opad.

If I do not decode the API before hashing they return the same result. But for this particular purpose, the key needs to be decoded. The message variable is just my first name ""Parit"" in case someone wants to replicate.
","I thought that Utilities.computeHmacSignature() might not be able to use []byte for the value. So as a workaround, how about using jsSHA? I think that in your case, you can use https://github.com/Caligatio/jsSHA/blob/master/src/sha512.js.
The flow for using jsSHA is as follows.
Flow :

Download sha512.js.
On script editor, create new script as for example, the filename of sha512.js.


Copy and paste the script of sha512.js to the created script.

Copy and paste the sample script to Code.gs of the script editor.
Run myFunction() of the sample script.

Sample script :
function myFunction() {
  var message = ""Parit"";
  var secret = ""W0+m0Dc9GMN9yDVeq3GMDsJ49WasEhQHkNHNuDw3wNg="";
  var obj = new jsSHA(""SHA-512"", ""TEXT"");
  obj.setHMACKey(secret, ""B64"");
  obj.update(message);
  Logger.log(obj.getHMAC(""B64""))
}

Note :

When I tested Parit for message, I got BfVNi21gY09c8M18cWBRBgo1W9pAlXM99ZVoF7Kz2ETFnIuvXjj8NRvRgn/GaT/m6YJ8efsr5s9EDbIhznAaag==.

It this was not useful for you, I'm sorry.
Update :
By the Google's update at June 19, 2018, Utilities.computeHmacSignature() got to be able to use the byte arrays. By this, using only native Google Apps Scvript, the result can be retrieved without using jsSHA. So I would like to update my answer.
Modified script :
function myFunction() {
  var message = ""Parit"";
  var secret = ""W0+m0Dc9GMN9yDVeq3GMDsJ49WasEhQHkNHNuDw3wNg="";

  var value = Utilities.base64Decode(Utilities.base64Encode(message));
  var key = Utilities.base64Decode(secret);
  var out = Utilities.computeHmacSignature(Utilities.MacAlgorithm.HMAC_SHA_512, value, key);
  var res = Utilities.base64Encode(out)
  Logger.log(res)
}

Result :

It seems that when I make the invocation to the server, even though my request URI is of the format,
http://mywebapp.azurewebsites.net/api/foo/bar?val=123

Around half the time, the request URI in the HttpResponseMessage comes back as
http://mywebapp.azurewebsites.net/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2Fapi%2Ffoo%2Fbar%3Fval%3D123

This only happens when I apply the HMACAuthentication attribute on my foo controller.
The strange part is that it doesn't happen every time and doesn't happen when I run on localhost. I've copied out the example exactly from the github repo. I was thinking the server time might have something to do with this, but that doesn't explain why the requests go through sometimes and fail at others... it should be consistent. Not sure what part of the code is relevant to put down here either so please let me know what'd help to see.
I'd appreciate any insight on this. Thanks in advance!
","Figured it out, the problem was occurring in the isReplayRequest method in the repo.
Here's the original method definition:
    private bool isReplayRequest(string nonce, string requestTimeStamp)
    {
        if (System.Runtime.Caching.MemoryCache.Default.Contains(nonce))
        {
            return true;
        }

        DateTime epochStart = new DateTime(1970, 01, 01, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc);
        TimeSpan currentTs = DateTime.UtcNow - epochStart;

        var serverTotalSeconds = Convert.ToUInt64(currentTs.TotalSeconds);
        var requestTotalSeconds = Convert.ToUInt64(requestTimeStamp);

        if ((serverTotalSeconds - requestTotalSeconds) > requestMaxAgeInSeconds)
        {
            return true;
        }

        System.Runtime.Caching.MemoryCache.Default.Add(nonce, requestTimeStamp, DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddSeconds(requestMaxAgeInSeconds));

        return false;
    }

The issue was occurring at the second if condition where the serverTotalSeconds and requestTotalSeconds are unsigned integers. 
There were periodic cases where the timestamps would end up negative (i.e. the requestTotalSeconds was greater than serverTotalSeconds by 1), which would end up setting the value of (serverTotalSeconds - requestTotalSeconds) as 18446744073709551615, which is the max value UInt64 can hold.
In my case, I used two TimeSpan objects to compare the time and derive the difference in seconds.
Hope this helps someone else.

This gets a few strings, concats those creates a sha256 hash for them and at the end encodes everything for URI representation.
Here is my racket version which sadly does not yield the same results as the JS version one.
For one the last encoding into URI is missing but I also have the suspicion that the sha256 code isnt right.
#lang racket

(define x (auth-token ""master"" ""Das Ist Ein Datum""))

EDIT
I tried to boil down the example so I can see what is wrong and here is what I got
;; racket

","Your boiled-down example should be
(encode (hmac-sha256 (string->bytes/utf-8 ""master"")(string->bytes/utf-8 ""payload"")))
not
(encode (hmac-sha256 (decode ""master"")(string->bytes/utf-8 ""payload"")))
The former version returns the correct result.
A possible flaw is that you (map string-downcase) over all the text components, whereas the JS function does not call toLowerCase on resourceLink. Try this:
(define (auth-token master-key date [verb """"] [res-type """"] [res-link """"])
  (let* ([! string-downcase] [->bytes string->bytes/utf-8]
         [text/list  (list (! verb) ""\n"" (! res-type) ""\n"" res-link ""\n"" (! date) ""\n"")]
         [text/bytes (->bytes (string-append* text/list))]
         [signature  (encode (hmac-sha256 (->bytes master-key) text/bytes))])
    (string-append ""type=master&ver=1.0&sig="" signature)))

The JS version also ends by calling encodeURIComponent. I don't know what that does but there doesn't seem to be any equivalent in your code

""SharedAccessSignature sr={resource-uri}&sig=koNqIJF56tzzBpqWYp4tRvxeWIJEHSLugA2O2weELZ4%3D&se=1492307707&skn=iothubowner"".
Despite all this, I'm still getting an 401... Been at it for a couple hours now trying all sorts of things without any success. Wondering if it has something to do with the hmac encryption function?  Any forge folks out there that can verify the code?  For those interested, I'm in an ionic 2 application (based on angular 2) and using angular 2's http class to perform the request.
Thanks.
","As I haven't had 50 reputation now, I cannot post this as a comment.
Did you decode the SharedAccessKey with base64?
I'm not familiar with Forge, but here's what I did with CryptoJS
https://github.com/azure-iothub/device-management/blob/master/main.js#L117
The connectionInfo is gotten from connection string with getInfoFromConnectionString method
https://github.com/azure-iothub/device-management/blob/master/main.js#L74
I hope this can help.

","To get a HMAC matching the online generators, it's a simple as;
unsigned char* data = ""data"";

unsigned char* t;

In your example, you're using MD5 on the key before calculating the HMAC, which is not what the online generators do. Of course, if your key or data are not regular null terminated strings, you need to replace the strlen calls with the actual length.

","I think it might be the fact that the policy needs to be base64 encoded.
Here's some code that I've been using. You'll see the slight difference:

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = ""XXX""

policy = base64.b64encode(policy_document)

signature = base64.b64encode(hmac.new(AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, policy, hashlib.sha1).digest())

My policy_document is already a string, hence the lack of json.dumps() but it goes through b64encode() before being used in the hash.

"25312201","Provides tapestry's hmac-passphrase sufficient csrf protection?","I wonder, why Tapestry's hmac funcionality is not enough to prevent Cross-Site-Request-Forgery.

Tapestry encodes serialized objects into Base64 encoded strings that are stored on the client; primarily, this is for form submissions, to encode the set of operations needed to process the form when it is submitted.

(quoted jira issue)
The tapestry framework (version 5.3.6 and newer) signs the above data using hmac. When the form is submitted by the client, this data is included in the POST request in a t:formdata parameter and validated by the server.
From my point of view, this is enough to protect against crsf. The signed data is created on the server with a key, that only the server knows.
How should an attacker create a valid t:formdata Element which is accepted by the server?
I'm confused because I found several libraries/implementations on the internet, which add csrf-protection to tapestry.
I also read this SO-answer which states, that hmac ""might"" (or might not?) be sufficient csrf protection. 
Concluding: In which cases does the hmac not provide sufficient protection against csrf and why?
","The HMAC only applies to portions of the submitted form data, the part that Tapestry will de-serialized into Java objects. That was, in theory, enough for an attacker to compromise the server JVM (though not, necessarily, to be able to inject code or behavior into the application). With HMAC enabled, the submitted form data is secure, for as long as the HMAC is kept secret on the server.

","The problem is the encoding.
JWT uses base64url encoding :

A JWT is represented as a sequence of URL-safe parts separated by
     period ('.') characters.  Each part contains a base64url-encoded
     value.

but you are using base64 encoding in the signature, as shown in your code example. 
The difference between base64url encoding and base64 encoding is, that the characters '+' and '/' from the normal base64 output will be replaced by '-' and '_' and the trailing '=' (padding) will be omitted.
You say:

And I found the ""-"",""_"" in webside and convert ""+"",""/"" in my output signature. 

With '-' and '_' instead of '+' and '/' you have a correct output.
When you have a base64url encoded signature like this

eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.L9YSDasvO2B5i8FZUczC-MAtSsTuM0Dj-FEpfn6uoRs

the signature wil be verified.

"33330645","PHP double randomised hmac verification to prevent timing attack","A way to prevent timing attacks for hash string comparison is to perform additional HMAC signing in order to randomize the verification process (see https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2011/february/double-hmac-verification/). 
In addition to the second HMAC hashing for each hash, a random salt of random length is added to both in order to make the hashing timing / process even less predictable.
My implementation of this look like this:
function hmac_verify ($hash_original, $message, $key) {

    $hmac_salt = '...'; // was added at the original HMAC signing
    $random_salt = openssl_random_pseudo_bytes (rand(16,96));

    $raw_hash = hash_hmac('sha512', $message . $hmac_salt, $key, true);
    $hash_compare = base64_encode ($raw_hash); // $hash_original is in base64 
    $hash_compare_safe = hash_hmac('sha512', $hash_compare, $random_salt, true);
    $hash_original_safe = hash_hmac('sha512', $hash_original, $random_salt, true);

    if ($hash_compare_safe === $hash_original_safe) return true;
        else return false;

}

The function is called in this way after decrypting the encrypted text in order to verify the decryption result:
if (!hmac_verify ($hmac_hash, $plaintext . $cipher_text, $key . $iv)) return ""HASH ERROR"";

Will this successfully prevent a timing attack? Am I doing anything unnecessary? Could something be improved?
A second question is whether it is more advisable to perform the HMAC verification on the plaintext, the ciphertext, or both (as in my example), and why. 
","I've left some comments inline as I read your function. This isn't an analysis after reading the whole thing, rather this is what I immediately think of as I read it.
function hmac_verify ($hash_original, $message, $key) {
    ##
    # Nitpick: A variable named $hash_original will prime people who read
    # your code to think of simple hash functions rather than HMAC
    ##

    $hmac_salt = '...'; // was added at the original HMAC signing
    ##
    # What is this? $hmac_salt? Looks like a hard coded-salt (a.k.a. pepper).
    # I wouldn't trust this with my life.
    ##

    $random_salt = openssl_random_pseudo_bytes (rand(16,96));
    ##
    # Why are you bothering to randomize this? Just use a static value
    # approximating the output size of the hash function (i.e. 64).
    ##

    $raw_hash = hash_hmac('sha512', $message . $hmac_salt, $key, true);
    $hash_compare = base64_encode ($raw_hash); // $hash_original is in base64 
    $hash_compare_safe = hash_hmac('sha512', $hash_compare, $random_salt, true);
    ##
    # Ah, yeah, don't pepper. HMAC is secure.
    ##
    $hash_original_safe = hash_hmac('sha512', $hash_original, $random_salt, true);

    if ($hash_compare_safe === $hash_original_safe) return true;
        else return false;
    ##
    # Why not just do this?
    # return $hash_compare_safe === $hash_original_safe;
    ## 

}

So, I would highly recommend separating this out into two separate mechanisms: One that calculates MACs and the other that compares strings in constant time (like PHP 5.6's hash_equals() does).
function hmac_verify ($hmac, $message, $key)
{
    $calc = hash_hmac('sha512', $message, $key, true);
    return hmac_equals($hmac, $calc);
}

function hmac_equals($hmac, $calc)
{
    $random = openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(64);
    return (
        hash_hmac('sha512', $hmac, $random)
            ===
        hash_hmac('sha512', $calc, $random)
    );

My current setup simply passes the username, and the password in md5 format to authenticate against my DB.  
Is there a framework people recommend using.  I've heard of oAuth and HMAC with PHP but I'm not sure if these are overkill for what I need.
Any thoughts?
","For starters, MD5 is not considered secure anymore.  It's just too easy to brute-force with modern hardware.
Secondly, if you're sending an MD5 over the wire & that is what you have in the database, you are effectively using the MD5 of the password as the password.  This means you're sending the unencrypted password over the wire.  Think about it - an attacker just needs to capture the MD5 and send it back if they want to break in - you are not getting any actual security from this.
Just send plaintext username and password over SSL.  Compare it against a server-side secure hash (bcrypt is considered the way to go these days) that's got a secret key merged in.  This will limit risk if your DB gets compromised.

I thought you needed to replace '+' and '=' to '%' signs. 

Yes, but you don't just replace them with %.  Use this map:
+ becomes %2B
/ becomes %2F
= becomes %3D

This is referred to as url-encoding, url-escaping, or percent-encoding.  The characters are replaced by a literal % followed by their 2-digit hex ASCII equivalent.

And if it should not be hardcoded, where sholud it be putted?
I'm thinking to implement JWT authentication.
","HMAC secret key is a plain text. As any private/secret text, you should avoid to store (hard-code) text as simple/plain string, because it can be revealed using disassembling.
So yes, it is a good thing to somehow obfuscate the secret key, doing at least simple text transform. In general you can choose any kind of transformation.
One of the approaches is to use encoding/decoding for transformation: your secret key is stored in source as encoded string, and decoded at runtime when is needed. For example you can use XOR encryption suggested by Google:
static String stringTransform(String s, int i) {
   char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
   for(int j = 0; j<chars.length; j++)
      chars[j] = (char)(chars[j] ^ i);
   return String.valueOf(chars);
}

This function should be used for both encryption and decryption, ""i"" is an any random value.

"26423662","Scalatra response HMAC calulation","I'm developing a web service using Scalatra and I want to use HMAC for bidirectional authentication. 
So far, I've implemented the client authentication to the server: the client (an Android app) calculates a HMAC/SHA512 for each request using these parameters: a shared secret, the HTTP method, URL, some headers (timestamp, clientId etc) and the request body (if it's a POST or a PUT). This HMAC is then added to a specific header and the request is sent to the server (which validates the HMAC in the request header with a HMAC that it calculates the same as the client).
Now, I want to do the opposite thing: have the server authenticate to the client using the stored shared secret, the request HTTP method, URL and the response body.
So far, I've found that I can override renderResponse(actionResult: Any), renderResponseBody(actionResult: Any) or even renderPipeline and I've decided to go with overriding renderPipeline as it seems to be the easiest to handle.
In my overriden renderPipeline I transform the response body to a byte array (loading the served File in memory if serving a File), calculate the HMAC and add it to the response headers.
What I want to know is: are there cases when overriding renderPipeline this way would break either the authentication functionality presented above (like renderPipeline not being called or being called multiple times or the headers having been sent befor renderPipeline is called to render the body) or some other functionality in Scalatra? 
As a note I do not calculate the HMAC when the action returns Unit and the response output is being written directly by the action.
","I had exactly the same problem to solve. I used a trait extending Handler, just like it's done in the GZipSupport.scala and using this answer as a reference implementation.
I built a ServletOutputStreamCopier which holds a copy of the original OutputStream and every byte to both streams:
class ServletOutputStreamCopier(orig: ServletOutputStream) extends ServletOutputStream {
    val copy: ByteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream(1024)

    override def write(b: Int): Unit = {
      orig.write(b)
      copy.write(b)
    }
    override def setWriteListener(writeListener: WriteListener): Unit = orig.setWriteListener(writeListener)

    override def isReady: Boolean = orig.isReady

    def getCopy: Array[Byte] = copy.toByteArray
}

Then a ResponseCopier, which is an HttpServletResponseWrapper with the previously defined ServletOutputStreamCopier and exposes the copy to the outside:
class ResponseCopier(res: HttpServletResponse, sos:   ServletOutputStreamCopier, w: PrintWriter) extends HttpServletResponseWrapper(res) {
    override def getOutputStream: ServletOutputStream = new ServletOutputStreamCopier(sos)

    override def getWriter: PrintWriter = w

    override def setContentLength(i: Int) = {}

    def getCopy: Array[Byte] = sos.getCopy
}

Finally the handle method takes care of adding the header after the Scalatra action was completed by using the callback ScalatraBase.onRenderedComplete.
trait SignedResponseSupport extends Handler {
  self: ScalatraBase =>

  abstract override def handle(req: HttpServletRequest, res: HttpServletResponse): Unit = {
    withRequestResponse(req, res) {
      val sosc = new ServletOutputStreamCopier(res.getOutputStream)
      val w = new PrintWriter(sosc)
      val wrapped = new ResponseCopier(response,sosc ,w)

      ScalatraBase.onRenderedCompleted { _ =>
        w.flush()
        w.close()
        val password = ""secret-password""
        val signature = signResponseBody(wrapped.getCopy, password)
        wrapped.addHeader(""X-Response-Signature"", signature)
        }
      }
      super.handle(req, wrapped)
    }

  def signResponseBody(body: Array[Byte], password: String): String = {
    /*signing goes here*/
  }

}

"48427354","Ruby HMAC signing issue","I got an issue with HMAC. 
I have to sign a form before sending it to a bank. 
They only provide an example in PHP in their documentation. 
I have a hex key to sign my data (e.g. FCEBA61A884A938E7E7FE4F5C68AA7F4A349768EE5957DDFBE99C1D05A09CBACF1FCF0A7084CB2E4CBA95193176C4395DE7F39EA9DBEBEF0907D77192AAE3E8A). 
In the PHP exemple, they do this with the key before signing the data:
 $key = ""FCEBA61A884A938E7E7FE4F5C68AA7F4A349768EE5957DDFBE99C1D05A09CBACF1FCF0A7084CB2E4CBA95193176C4395DE7F39EA9DBEBEF0907D77192AAE3E8A"";
 $message = ""param1=a&param2=b"";

 $binKey = pack('H*', $key);
 $signature = hash_hmac('sha512', $msg, $binKey);
 echo $signature;

 // => a3efb70368bee502ea57a1a4708cac8912a5172075ea8dec2de2770dfbb4c8fb587f03fdadc0ca4f9e1bb024cfda12866295b259f5fb4df2fe14d960874a68ab

I don't understand why they pack the key and if I should do something similar with my key.
I did the following in my Ruby code: 
key = ""FCEBA61A884A938E7E7FE4F5C68AA7F4A349768EE5957DDFBE99C1D05A09CBACF1FCF0A7084CB2E4CBA95193176C4395DE7F39EA9DBEBEF0907D77192AAE3E8A""
message = ""param1=a&param2=b""

digest = OpenSSL::Digest.new('sha512')
signature = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(digest, key, message)

puts signature

","You need to do this in Ruby:
hash = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(digest, [key].pack('H*'), message)

The real issue here is that your PHP code uses two variable names for the message.  You set $message, then use $msg, which means you're computing the hash for an undefined variable.

"44439713","Encoding newline in VB.NET for HMAC SHA1","I'm having a problem authenticating an API with OAuth. I can get it work fine in Python, but not in VB.Net. I realised the issue is that SHA1 algorithm is returning a different value in Python and VB.NET for the what I thought was the same message. This only seems to be the case when there is a newline character ""\n"" in the message (which there has to be for the API call). Using Environment.NewLine doesn't seem to help.
The code I'm using (based on this answer) is here, with the expected values I get from my Python program:
Public Sub Main()           
    ' Expect D/5B78PD9pFhmqZQi3eenPBy6ks=
    ' Get    D/5B78PD9pFhmqZQi3eenPBy6ks=

    ' Expect yuuq6RwtwkoJ6n3PquGFx60MLas=
    ' Get    uv4AwQjvYeCTajhHw7EFtPlJfCE=
    console.writeline(getHash(""a"", ""msg\n""))

    ' Expect yuuq6RwtwkoJ6n3PquGFx60MLas=       
    ' Get efRfAnmIN/C/YX/UPHVPFY5VjJg=
    console.writeline(getHash(""a"", ""msg"" + Environment.NewLine))

End Sub

Public Function getHash(ByVal key As String, ByVal msg As String) As String
    Dim myEncoder As New System.Text.UTF8Encoding
    Dim keyBytes() As Byte = myEncoder.GetBytes(key)
    Dim msgBytes() As Byte = myEncoder.GetBytes(msg)

    Dim myHMACSHA1 As New System.Security.Cryptography.HMACSHA1(keyBytes)
    Dim HashCode As Byte() = myHMACSHA1.ComputeHash(msgBytes)

    Return Convert.ToBase64String(HashCode)
End Function

In case it's useful, my Python program is:
import base64
import hashlib
import hmac

key = ""a""
msg = ""msg\n""
key_byte = key.encode('utf-8')
msg_byte = msg.encode('utf-8')

h = hmac.new(key_byte, msg_byte, hashlib.sha1)
print base64.b64encode(h.digest())   # yuuq6RwtwkoJ6n3PquGFx60MLas=

My guess is it's something to do with how the newline character is encoded, but I can't figure out how to solve it.
","To start with I'd just like to point out that \n in VB.NET does not represent a new line character. It will literally just become \n.
Environment.NewLine adapts to the current OS. Different operating systems use different line endings. The issue here is that the Python code is using a Line Feed character (\n) as a new line indicator, but since Environment.NewLine adapts to the OS it will return Windows' line ending, which is Carriage Return + Line Feed (\r\n).
Therefore if you want it to match the Python code you've got to be sure to insert a Line Feed only. For instance:
Console.WriteLine(getHash(""a"", ""msg"" & vbLf))

i have to validate the request i receive, so i know it's from Facebook.
i have to generate a hash that receives the payload (BLOB) and a key (string)  that both facebook and i share (app_secret), and then i compare it to the value of X-Hub-Signature, so i can confirm it's a valid request.
problem is, Facebook says:
""Please note that we generate the signature using an escaped unicode version of the payload, with lowercase hex digits. If you just calculate against the decoded bytes, you will end up with a different signature. For example, the string äöå should be escaped to \u00e4\u00f6\u00e5.""
So far my hashes are a match to the payloads i receive, but i tried with those äöå characters and i can't know for sure if it's working, since all hmac online encoders don't look that good and also i don't know how to unicode escape them (on the online encoders).
so far i have this:

","Moving my comment as answer, so that the question is properly answered. As it become clear OP uses different python3 versions.

module-level hmac.digest() is new in 3.7. So it's not available

  guess on Windows you have the latest 3.7 installed.

","any given implementation of HMAC-SHA1 will produce the same set of bytes given the same set of bytes as the input message and key.  
That said, there can be a lot of variation on how various interfaces work and how they accept those bytes.  For example, one library may output the hash as a hex string, and another may output it as an array of bytes.  Or one would take a string as input with a UTF-8 encoding, whereas another would take it in as a UTF-16 encoding.  You would need to be careful that the same bytes are hitting the algorithm in different libraries to ensure you get the same result.
Also, while HMAC-SHA1 is probably okay from a security perspective, you should probably be using HMAC-SHA256 instead.

"18077729","Hashing and using time as salt to prevent access from un-authorized system and replay attacks","I am currently writing a user authentication API for a mobile game. I'd want to make sure that the user can only access the system from the mobile app. (That is, the server has to deny access if the Server API is accessed from browser or CURL (un-authorized system) even though the exact POST parameters are valid). Ideally, the system should not allow replay attacks as well.
Does anybody have idea or example of how this can be done?
I am thinking of adding a unique-per-user salt with current timestamp and SHA256-ing the parameters with a private key on the client app, which will then be validated on the server. This way will prevent the access from browser or CURL as attackers will need to get the private key in order to compute the SHA256 hash. The salt (which includes timestamp) will also be sent as one of the params, and the server will get the timestamp and deny access if it is past a certain time. But I am not very sure about the security and whether it is the common or correct practice, as I've never design secured app, or seen the source code of one before.
Thanks for your input!
","This will stop users from intercepting requests on network and using them with CURL. But both private key and signature algorithm can be extracted for your app and reimplemented, so this solution will not be totally secure. 
Alas, you can't have complete security here without some custom tamper-resistant hardware issued to users.

76-EB-A0-9F-CB-54-87-72-99-DC-BD-1E-1E-35-71-7E-3B-D4-2E-06-6E-7E-CD-B1-31-C7-D0-16-1D-EC-34-18

Obviously, when comparing bytes for bytes, this doesn't work. 
I see that I'm having to convert the expected_sig and the signature in different ways to get them to display as a string, but I can't figure out how I need to change the expected signature to get to where I can compare bytes for bytes.
I can obviously work around the issue but simply converting the string bar, but that's dirty and I just don't like it.
Where am I going wrong here? What am I not understanding?
","The good news is that the hash computation appears to be working.
The bad news is that you're receiving the hash in a brain-dead fashion. For some reason it seems that the authors decided it was a good idea to:

Compute the hash (fine)
Convert this binary data to text as hex (fine)
Convert the hex back into binary data by applying ASCII/UTF-8/anything-ASCII-compatible encoding (why?)
Convert the result back into text using base64 (what?)
URL-encode the result (which wouldn't even be necessary with hex...)

Using either base64 or hex on the original binary makes sense, but applying both is crazy.
Anyway, it's fairly easy for you to do the same thing. For example:
string hexSignature = string.Join("""", signature.Select(b => b.ToString(""x2"")));
byte[] hexSignatureUtf8 = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(hexSignature);
string finalSignature = Convert.ToBase64String(hexSignatureUtf8);

That should now match WebUtility.UrlDecode(split[1]).
Alternatively, you can work backwards from what's in the result, but I wouldn't go as far as parsing the hex back to bytes - it would be simpler to keep the first line of the above, but use:
string expectedHexBase64 = WebUtility.UrlDecode(split[1]);
byte[] expectedHexUtf8 = Convert.FromBase64String(expectedHexBase64);
string expectedHex = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(expectedHexUtf8);

Then compare it with hexSignature.
Ideally, you should talk to whoever's providing you with the crazy format and hit them with a cluestick though...

I'm scratching my head a lot now. I think b'' and [0] are equivalent salts, but I'm not sure. I think they both use utf-8 to encode the password, but I'm not sure. And I'm not convinced the JavaScript hmacSHA256 function exactly matches what Python is doing. Or it could be something else still.
","Off the top of my head, have you checked if
hash = sjcl.misc.pbkdf2(""password"", """", 100000, 256);

gives the correct result?
As far as I can tell from the docs, SJCL's PBKDF2 implementation defaults to HMAC-SHA256 if you don't explicitly give it a PRF.  If making that change fixes the bug, then there's probably something wrong with your hmacSHA256 wrapper.
Also, I'm not sure if specifying an empty salt as [0] really works (or is guaranteed to work in future versions, given that the format of SJCL's bitArrays is explicitly subject to change), but """" definitely should work.

","Your issue is strtol(). It expects a string. In C a string is an arbitrary sequence of characters terminated with a NULL-byte. However, it is provided a pointer to an array of size two where the last entry is not NULL. Therefore, strtol() also analysis the bytes behind your tmp array.
Since, tmp is stored on the stack we can not assume that the subsequent bytes are always the same for different invocations. Thus, you get random results.
Solution: Either, you increase the size of tmp and add a NULL byte in the last place or - and this is probably the better solution - you directly initialize nonce and key with what you need (see also this post):

I've been struggling with returning the correct HMAC. I'm using ring for the SHA256 digests but no matter what I try, I can't seem to get the right result. I suspect it might have something to do with .as_ref().to_vec() conversions. Even if that's true, I don't know how to continue from that. Not everything from RFC 2104 is implemented in the following code, but it highlights my issue.
extern crate ring;
use ring::{digest, test};

pub fn hmac(k: Vec<u8>, mut m: Vec<u8>) -> Vec<u8> {
    // Initialize ipad and opad as byte vectors with SHA256 blocksize
    let ipad = vec![0x5C; 64];
    let opad = vec![0x36; 64];
    // iround and oround are used to seperate the two steps with XORing
    let mut iround = vec![];
    let mut oround = vec![];

    for count in 0..k.len() {
        iround.push(k[count] ^ ipad[count]);
        oround.push(k[count] ^ opad[count]);
    }

    iround.append(&mut m); // m is emptied here
    iround = (digest::digest(&digest::SHA256, &iround).as_ref()).to_vec();
    oround.append(&mut iround); // iround is emptied here
    oround = (digest::digest(&digest::SHA256, &oround).as_ref()).to_vec();
    let hashed_mac = oround.to_vec();

    return hashed_mac;
}

#[test]
fn test_hmac_digest() {
    let k = vec![0x61; 64];
    let m = vec![0x62; 64];

    assert_eq!(actual, expected);
}

These are the digests:
Actual = [139, 141, 144, 52, 11, 3, 48, 112, 117, 7, 56, 151, 163, 65, 152, 195, 163, 164, 26, 250, 178, 100, 187, 230, 89, 61, 191, 164, 146, 228, 180, 62]

Expected = [246, 203, 179, 123, 50, 109, 54, 242, 242, 125, 41, 74, 195, 187, 70, 166, 170, 194, 156, 28, 153, 54, 185, 133, 87, 96, 65, 191, 179, 56, 174, 112]

","As mentioned in a comment, you have swapped the bytes for the inner and outer padding. Refer back to the Wikipedia page:
o_key_pad = key xor [0x5c * blockSize]   //Outer padded key
i_key_pad = key xor [0x36 * blockSize]   //Inner padded key

Here's what my take on the function would look like. I believe it has less allocation:
extern crate ring;

use ring::{digest, test};

const BLOCK_SIZE: usize = 64;

pub fn hmac(k: &[u8], m: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
    assert_eq!(k.len(), BLOCK_SIZE);

    let mut i_key_pad: Vec<_> = k.iter().map(|&k| k ^ 0x36).collect();
    let mut o_key_pad: Vec<_> = k.iter().map(|&k| k ^ 0x5C).collect();

    i_key_pad.extend_from_slice(m);

    let hash = |v| digest::digest(&digest::SHA256, v);

    let a = hash(&i_key_pad);

    o_key_pad.extend_from_slice(a.as_ref());

    hash(&o_key_pad).as_ref().to_vec()
}

","[Edit: I've edited this answer heavily since first writing it, to make it clearer, and to emphasize the use of Array#pack.]
Unfortunately, the way to express raw bytes in Ruby is with a string. You should probably force the encoding to ASCII 8-bit, as opposed to the default UTF-8, so that chars are the same thing as bytes, and no fancy conversions will be done on the input data.
You can explicitly set the encoding of a string:
2.5.0 :008 > my_string = String.new.force_encoding(Encoding::ASCII_8BIT)
 => """"
2.5.0 :009 > my_string.encoding
 => #<Encoding:ASCII-8BIT>

...or use the Array#pack method:
2.5.0 :010 > a123 = [1,2,3].pack('c*')
 => ""\x01\x02\x03""
2.5.0 :011 > a123.encoding
 => #<Encoding:ASCII-8BIT>

...or any combination thereof:
2.5.0 :018 > my_string = String.new.force_encoding(Encoding::ASCII_8BIT)
 => """"
2.5.0 :019 > my_string << [4,5,6].pack('c*')
 => ""\x04\x05\x06""
2.5.0 :020 > my_string << [7,8,9].pack('c*')
 => ""\x04\x05\x06\a\b\t""
2.5.0 :021 > my_string.bytes
 => [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

The pack method is a great way to insert values into the string, since it's very explicit about the format.
You could of course also use an array of byte values, but that array would not be compatible with most use cases.
I'm not certain that will solve your problem, but it's worth a try.

","You will want to consider the ""replay attacker"". When the attacker captures a packet between your API client and the server, what damage can she do when she replays it later? 
In your case, if you only use the API key of the user in the HMAC, then the attacker will be able to impersonate that user when she replay the requests. She can call any API request and just set the HMAC to what she captured, as it will validate.
If none of the parameters of the request are included, the attacker will be able to call the request and specify her own parameters. So it's better if the parameters are also included in the HMAC. It doesn't prevent replay of the request with these specific parameters though.
You can include a timestamp parameter to the request and in the HMAC. The server will recompute the HMAC including the timestamp passed in, and it will also verify that the timestamp is recent enough. As the attacker cannot forge new HMAC out of thin air, she will only be able to use ones with matching timestamps that you will reject based on age.

","First, you should understand that there are attacks that allow an attacker to modify encrypted data without decrypting it. See Is there an attack that can modify ciphertext while still allowing it to be decrypted? on Security.SE and Malleability attacks against encryption without authentication on Crypto.SE. If an attacker gets write access to the encrypted data -- even without any decryption keys -- they could cause significant havoc.
You say that the encrypted data is ""never transmitted outside of the application generating it"" but in the next two sentences you say that you ""save it to the database"" which appears (to me) to be something of a contradiction. Trusting the processing of encrypted data in memory is one thing, but trusting its serialization to disk, especially if done by another program (such as a database system) and/or on a separate physical machine (now or in the future, as the system evolves).
The significant question here is: would it ever be a possible for an attacker to modify or replace the encrypted data with alternate encrypted data, without access to the application and keys? If the attacker is an insider and runs the program as a normal user, then it's not generally possible to defend your data: anything the program allows the attacker to do is on the table. However, HMAC is relevant when write access to the data is possible for a non-user (or for a user in excess of their normal permissions). If the database is compromised, an attacker could possibly modify data with impunity, even without access to the application itself. Using HMAC verification severely limits the attacker's ability to modify the data usefully, even if they get write access.

You can pass a custom :body_reader option to Plug.Parsers in order to cache the body for later use.
You'll want to not read the body before the Parser and instead cache the body to read later from your plug that wants to hash it.
Option:

:body_reader - an optional replacement (or wrapper) for
  Plug.Conn.read_body/2  to provide a function that gives access to the
  raw body before it is parsed and discarded. It is in the standard
  format of {Module, :function, [args]} (MFA) and defaults to
  {Plug.Conn, :read_body, []}.

Example:

Sometimes you may want to customize how a parser reads the body from
  the connection. For example, you may want to cache the body to perform
  verification later, such as HTTP Signature Verification. This can be
  achieved with a custom body reader that would read the body and store
  it in the connection, such as:
defmodule CacheBodyReader do
  def read_body(conn, opts) do
    {:ok, body, conn} = Plug.Conn.read_body(conn, opts)
    conn = update_in(conn.assigns[:raw_body], &[body | (&1 || [])])
    {:ok, body, conn}
  end
end

which could then be set as:
plug Plug.Parsers,
  parsers: [:urlencoded, :json],
  pass: [""text/*""],
  body_reader: {CacheBodyReader, :read_body, []},
  json_decoder: Jason

"20628589","Drawbacks of password-based SSL authentication for PHP REST API","I have developed an API that I want to secure through user authentication. My first idea was to assign to each user a secret key (password) and a client id (username) that they would send along with each request to the API. However, I have read many articles that suggest alternative authentication schemes, like OAuth2 or using HMAC hashes. What I cannot understand yet is the benefit of these schemes against a combination of HTTPS+password+username in terms of security. The only thing I found is that HTTPS may incur higher cost in terms of CPU, but I'm not convinced about the security benefits I'll get using other authentication schemes. 
Can you please offer me good reasons against using basic encrypted authentication, or to put it in other words, why I should prefer HMAC hashes or OAuth? 
","The main point of OAuth is to allow a third-party to use your API on behalf of a user. It basically ensures that the user doesn't need to share their username/password with the third-party.
If you are not going to allow third-party websites to connect to your website then there are simpler ways. It really depends on what your API is about, how it is accessed by the users (website, mobile application, etc.).
Sending the username and password with each request doesn't seem like a good idea, even over HTTPS, so maybe a better solution would be to have a ""/login"" function which returns a token on success. You can then use this token to access the API. The advantage is that you can expire the token in case of problem.

The server recalculates the hash using the private key it has listed for the user.
Now, on the server's side, I obviously can't store the secret key in plain-text. However, I also can't do a one way store using Hmac, because then, when I recalculate the hash on the data, it will give a different response.
What is the best way to store user's secret password on the server side?
","The best way is what you are doing now. I mean the password is never stored either as plain text nor in encrypted reversable form. I did not exactly understand your problem but if you want to make the system truly secure find solution for your problem without using user's password in plain form.
But if you indeed need this I'd recommend you at least to store passwords in DB encrypted. The encryption password should be also hidden somehow to make potential hacker's work harder.

","This seems to be a design choice for the Base64 encoders, one of them chose to use the _ character and one of them chose to use the / character (C# also uses the + character instead of the - character). If you need to use that string across languages you can use myString.replace(oldChar, newChar) (myString.Replace(oldChar, newChar) in C#) to replace the mismatch characters.

If you want C# Base64 strings to look like Java's Base64 strings you can use Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens.Base64UrlEncoder, but this is a Nuget package you would have to install. This uses - and _ instead of + and /.

I believe it may have something to do with the string to byte encoding, but I cannot pinpoint what exactly is causing the issue. When I was testing my HMAC code, I had to rely on online generators because I couldn't find vectors for HMAC-SHA224 and HMAC-SHA256. Some calculators would give me completely different output values for the same key, message combination. That could be because of how they are processing the inputs, but I am not sure. I would appreciate it if someone more experienced could help me out with this.
EDIT: This problem is solved. Seems that all that was needed was to pass int as a binary string of length 4. I updated the code with the fixes.
EDIT 2: I read the standard again to realize the solution was in my face the entire time (standard says to encode i as a 32-bit big endian integer).
","The solution was to convert int to a binary string of length 4. Thanks to @EgorSkriptunoff for his insight.

I have found many possible solutions for that online, however all of them require including some module or framework. 
Isn't HMAC and SHA512 not supported by swift 3.1 natively? 
Sorry if it's a stupid question, I'm relatively new to swift. 
If it's available, how can I simply encrypt some data using hmac sha512? 
Thanks.
","CommonCrypto is the native way to do encryption on Apple devices. You do not need any module or framework, you just add a bridging header and import CommonCrypto:
#import <CommonCrypto/CommonCrypto.h>

You then can compute your HMAC with a simple extension (Swift 4):
extension String {

    func hmac(key: String) -> String {
        var digest = [UInt8](repeating: 0, count: Int(CC_SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH))
        CCHmac(CCHmacAlgorithm(kCCHmacAlgSHA256), key, key.count, self, self.count, &digest)
        let data = Data(bytes: digest)
        return data.map { String(format: ""%02hhx"", $0) }.joined()
    }

}

Example:
let result = ""test"".hmac(key: ""test"")

Result:
88cd2108b5347d973cf39cdf9053d7dd42704876d8c9a9bd8e2d168259d3ddf7

If you use Swift on a non-Apple device you indeed need to use an external framework to do encryption.

Just get the files needed (md5.c, md5.h) from lwip (inside lwip /src/netif/ppp/md5.c), and copy it to your proyect.
Change the non-working line
uint32_t dev=HASH_MD5((uint8_t *) input, strlen((char *) input), Md5);

for
MD5_CTX mdContext;
MD5Init(&mdContext);
MD5Update(&mdContext, input, strlen((char *) input));
MD5Final(Md5,&mdContext);

Edited: Since i dont use ppp in the project, i have copied the md5 file from ppp to the project and I edited it a bit, removing all include references (except md5.h and string.h) and removing conditional compilation:
This is the stuff that I removed at the beginning
//#if PPP_SUPPORT /* don't build if not configured for use in lwipopts.h */

//#if CHAP_SUPPORT || MD5_SUPPORT

//#include ""ppp.h""
//#include ""pppdebug.h""

And this at the end:
//#endif /* CHAP_SUPPORT || MD5_SUPPORT */

//#endif /* PPP_SUPPORT */

You can download the source code for md5.c and md5.h here

"32208100","Do Windows crypto APIs run slower on purpose with debugger attached to the process?","In my Windows application I needed to implement the PBKDF2 encryption for passwords. For that I needed to calculate HMAC using SHA-256 many times over. So for a single round of that I was calling the following sequence of APIs:
//For simplicity I'm not posting the full code
//One can look up implementation of HMAC/SHA-256 in C
CryptAcquireContext(, NULL, MS_ENHANCED_PROV, PROV_RSA_FULL, CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT | CRYPT_NEWKEYSET);
CryptImportKey(, , 0, CRYPT_IPSEC_HMAC_KEY, );
CryptCreateHash(, CALG_HMAC, , 0, );
CryptSetHashParam(, HP_HMAC_INFO, , 0);
CryptHashData(, , , 0);
CryptGetHashParam(, HP_HASHVAL, NULL, , 0);
CryptGetHashParam(, HP_HASHVAL, , , 0);

This sequence may be called on the order of 10,000+ times in a sort of a loop according to PBKDF2 specifications.
I started noticing though, that if I run this sequence via Ctrl+F5 (in Visual Studio), or without a debugger, it executes in about less than 1 sec on my laptop. But if I attach a debugger to the process, it runs painfully slow -- sometimes close to 10+ seconds or so. (The timing in this case is also inconsistent.)
So I thought that this happens because of a debugger build. So I tried building a release build and then attached a debugger. To my amazement it was also running slow.
So I'm curious, is there something in those crypto APIs that make them run slower with the debugger attached?
","
I just tried it and if I attach Visual Studio debugger to my running process, it doesn't seem to happen.

Then it depends from the Windows debug heap (not to be confused with the CRT debug heap, which is completely unrelated and is activated building in debug mode):

Instead of using the standard heap API, processes that the debugger creates use a special debug heap. You can force a spawned process to use the standard heap instead of the debug heap by using the _NO_DEBUG_HEAP environment variable or the -hd command-line option.

"19846172","Which of these encryption methods is more secure? Why?","I am writing a program that takes a passphrase from the user and then writes some encrypted data to file. The method that I have come up with so far is as follows:

Generate a 128-bit IV from hashing the filename and the system time, and write this to the beginning of the file.
Generate a 256-bit key from the passphrase using SHA256.
Encrypt the data (beginning with a 32-bit static signature) with this key using AES in CBC mode, and write it to file.

When decrypting, the IV is read, and then the passphrase used to generate the key in the same way, and the first 32-bits are compared against what the signature should be in order to tell if the key is valid.
However I was looking at the AES example provided in PolarSSL (the library I am using to do the hashing and encryption), and they use a much more complex method:

Generate a 128-bit IV from hashing the filename and file size, and write this to the beginning of the file.
Generate a 256-bit key from hashing (SHA256) the passphrase and the IV together 8192 times.
Initialize the HMAC with this key.
Encrypt the data with this key using AES in CBC mode, and write it to file, while updating the HMAC with each encrypted block.
Write the HMAC to the end of the file.

I get the impression that the second method is more secure, but I don't have enough knowledge to back that up, other than that it looks more complicated.

If it is more secure, what are the reasons for this?
Is appending an HMAC to the end of the file more secure than having a signature at the beginning of the encrypted data?
Does hashing 8192 times increase the security?

Note: This is an open source project so whatever method I use, it will be freely available to anyone.
","The second option is more secure.  
Your method, does not provide any message integrity.  This means that an attacker can modify parts of the ciphertext and alter what the plain text decrypts to.  So long as they don't modify anything that will alter your 32-bit static signature then you'll trust it.  The HMAC on the second method provides message integrity.
By hashing the key 8192 times it adds extra computational steps for someone to try and bruteforce the key.  Assume a user will pick a dictionary based password.  With your method an attacker must perform SHA256(someguess) and then try and decrypt.  However, with the PolarSSL version, they will have to calculate SHA256(SHA256(SHA256...(SHA256(someguess))) for 8192 times.  This will only slow an attacker down, but it might be enough (for now).
For what it's worth, please use an existing library.  Cryptography is hard and is prone to subtle mistakes.

","(Note, I couldn't reproduce that ""calculated_hmac"" because the sample ""content"" string must differ in some way from the original - probably just white space, but that's enough to totally alter the result ...). 
Anyway, based on the instructions, I'd guess the main issue is using strings, instead of binary, in the hashing:


Generate the hmac from the request body of the message.... You will need to convert the body to a byte array in UTF8.
To compute the hash, provide the byte array of the security token provided by Microsoft Teams when you registered the outgoing webhook.


First try decoding the body into binary
<cfset bodyBinary = charsetDecode(GetHttpRequestData().content, ""utf-8"")>

Do the same with the secret key
<cfset secretKey  = ""MsVx7SpJKnSiycvsUyLMiD8lDIFkEUDhuYuFAT94hXY="">
<cfset secretBinary = binaryDecode(secretKey, ""base64"")>

Lastly, don't forget HMAC() returns a hexadecimal string. If you need base64, you'll have to DIY:
<cfset hexHash = hmac(bodyBinary, secretBinary, ""HMACSHA256"")>
<cfset calculated_hmac = binaryEncode(binaryDecode(hexHash, ""hex""), ""base64"")>

"44581184","Why does Spring's default OAuth JWT implementation make the JWT verifier public?","Spring's default OAuth JWT flow (using client_credentials grant) is as follows:

Launch the Auth Server (AS)
Launch the Resource Server (RS)


At startup the RS requests the tokenKey by calling GET /oauth/token_key using Basic Auth

The AS returns a PUBLIC KEY using RS256 (SHA256withRSA)
Some time later, the Client requests an accessToken by calling GET /oauth/token using the client_credentials grant
The AS returns a JWT accessToken containing a JWS signature
The Client sends the JWT as a Bearer token to the RS
The RS uses the tokenKey that it received from the AS at startup to verify that the JWT accessToken came from the AS. This is where I get confused...

Is this secure? Why would a public cert be used rather than a shared secret key? Couldn't a hacker easily obtain the public key and sign their own valid JWT accessToken? How does the usage of the public key cert and the JWT signature work together to verify that the sender was actually the Auth Server and not an attacker?
Any insight would help.
","Some research into the nature of public key cryptography and digital signatures gleans this: 
Digital signatures implement asymmetric cryptography. A digital signature gives the receiver reason to believe the message was sent by the claimed sender. Similar to a handwritten signature they are difficult to forge. The signer, in this case, the AS, uses a secret PrivateKey to create the signature. Some non-repudiation schemes offer a time stamp for the digital signature, so that even when the PrivateKey is exposed, the signature is valid.
A digital signature scheme typically consists of 3 algorithms 
1) A key generation algorithm that selects a PrivateKey uniformly at random from a set of possible private keys. The algorithm outputs the private key and a corresponding public key.
2) A signing algorithm that creates a signature using the message and the private key
3) A signature verifying algorithm that, given the message, PublicKey and signature, either accepts or rejects the message's claim to authenticity.
In this case (RS256), the signature was created using SHA256withRSA which is not used as an encryption algorithm, rather it is used to verify the origin or the authenticity of the data.  The signature was generated using a private key. The public key is passed to the Resource server to be used to verify the signature. In this scenario, even if an attacker has the PublicKey, they cannot create a spoof message with the signature or alter the contents.

"51574050","How is a nonce RESTful when using HMAC?","I'm trying to wrap my head around RESTful practices as I attempt to implement my own REST API, and that said, there's a fair bit that's confusing me.
One of the resources I've come across is the REST Cookbook for logging in, and while I understand how a nonce works for HMAC authentication, I'm hung up on one of the caveats listed towards the bottom of the page:

Using nonces can improve your security, but you MUST store and compare nonces server-side.

Now, the original dissertation on the REST architecture asserts the following about statelessness:

5.1.3 Stateless
We next add a constraint to the client-server interaction: communication must be stateless in nature, as in the client-stateless-server (CSS) style of Section 3.4.3 (Figure 5-3), such that each request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client.

This constraint has popularly disallowed old DHTML webapp methods of maintaining authentication (e.g. a cookie containing a ""session ID"" hash that identifies a user's subsequent requests). If a server needs to remember which nonce values have been used, isn't that technically maintaining state much like a session ID? If a legitimate client loses state, how can it generate a valid nonce when the server shouldn't be storing, let alone disclosing, stateful information?
I get a feeling I'm seeing something wrong, missing a piece of the puzzle, or misinterpreting something in this method, but I can't figure out what for the life of me...

Get Some key using login credentials

Hash with a Secret Key
Transmit message, and include values that are in the message (not hashed)

Then

Receive the message
Use the unhashed values to rebuild the message 
Hash with secret key
If the hashes match, then the message is good.

I am implementing something similar - but I don't think I need to do some of these steps.  I wanted to Know: Does my implementation have security holes in the logic?
My Implementation:

Client asks the server to generate a Token - this requires login credentials.
Server creates a token but does not return it (it is kept in the database) - it returns a time stamp.
Client generates a message based on time stamp, user and other data.
Client hashes token with a secret key, provided outside of this process.
Client sends token to the server.

Then:

Receive the message
If that token is in the database, it is valid

My reasoning behind taking out the message reconstruct is: that happened when the token was generated and the client couldn't know about the token in the database unless that knew how to generate it which means they authenticated and have a secret key.

Thank you people let me know.
","I answered your question more completely here, in the context of the Poloniex exchange:
Ruby Http Post Parameters
To answer your specific questions from this post:

How do I find my post request data?

POST data simply means the body of your request. This could be JSON, plain text, form data, etc. In cases where a specific format (i.e. JSON) isn't mentioned, POST data probably refers to POST form data (Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded). This is how data submitted from a web form is formatted and indeed that appears to be what Poloniex is looking for. 
x-www-form-urlencoded data can be produced like this in Ruby:
form_data = URI.encode_www_form({:command => 'returnBalances', :nonce => Time.now.to_i * 1000 })
puts form_data


command=returnBalances&nonce=1447537613000

How do I use the HMAC-SHA512 method to encrypt this data so that I can send it in a header? (using Ruby)

HMAC digest produces a unique string based on a secret key and the data provided. In Ruby, you can produce an HMAC digest like so: 
OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest( 'sha512', secret, form_data)

"24107293","PHP HMAC - Will this implementation of a hmac validator be sufficient?","The following function is part of a Request class. The class basically just holds the information parsed from the headers and body, and I want to implement a secure HMAC validation scheme. I have not done this before, but I have read A LOT on the subject, both here on SO and other places. I chose the sha256 algo as a middle way between performance and security.
The class holds all the variables except the API_KEY which is a defined constant that changes for each version and the shared secret which I store in a DB after an initial three-way exchange with public-key encryption securing the shared secret during device-registration. validNonce() just looks up the nonce in the DB to see if it is valid.
My questions boils down to: Am I on the right track? Am I missing something bleeding obvious? 
public function isValidRequest($secret)
{
    if(!validNonce($this->nonce))
    {
        return false;
    }

    $data = API_KEY . $this->device_key . $this->user_key . 
            $this->cnonce . $this->nonce . $this->body;

    $hmac_hash = hash_hmac(""sha256"",$data,$secret);
    return $this->hash === $hmac_hash;
}

","
Am I on the right track? Am I missing something bleeding obvious? 

Timing attacks! Okay, so it's not really obvious, but that's the missing piece of the puzzle here.
The general solution (in diff format) is:
- return $this->hash === $hmac_hash;
+ return hash_equals($this->hash, $hmac_hash);

Furthermore, how you feed your data into HMAC needs to be carefully considered when working with multipart messages. Otherwise, even though you're using HMAC securely, you'll introduce the risk of creating two identical strings from different combinations of its constituent parts, which might be security-affecting.
$data = API_KEY . $this->device_key . $this->user_key . 
        $this->cnonce . $this->nonce . $this->body;

This was a concern of mine when I designed PASETO, so I defined a scheme I call PAE (pre-authentication encoding) that makes these messages distinct and unambiguous. You can find an implementation here (reproduced below):
<?php
class Util
{
    // ~8<~8<~8<~8<~8<~ SNIP SNIP ~8<~8<~8<~8<~8<~
    /**
     * Format the Additional Associated Data.
     *
     * Prefix with the length (64-bit unsigned little-endian integer)
     * followed by each message. This provides a more explicit domain
     * separation between each piece of the message.
     *
     * Each length is masked with PHP_INT_MAX using bitwise AND (&) to
     * clear out the MSB of the total string length.
     *
     * @param string ...$pieces
     * @return string
     */
    public static function preAuthEncode(string ...$pieces): string
    {
        $accumulator = \ParagonIE_Sodium_Core_Util::store64_le(\count($pieces) & PHP_INT_MAX);
        foreach ($pieces as $piece) {
            $len = Binary::safeStrlen($piece);
            $accumulator .= \ParagonIE_Sodium_Core_Util::store64_le($len & PHP_INT_MAX);
            $accumulator .= $piece;
        }
        return $accumulator;
    }
    // ~8<~8<~8<~8<~8<~ SNIP SNIP ~8<~8<~8<~8<~8<~
}

And a compatible JavaScript implementation:
function LE64(n) {
    var str = '';
    for (var i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
        if (i === 7) {
            // Clear the MSB for interoperability
            n &= 127;
        }
        str += String.fromCharCode(n & 255);
        n = n >>> 8;
    }
    return str;
}
function PAE(pieces) {
    if (!Array.isArray(pieces)) {
        throw TypeError('Expected an array.');
    }
    var count = pieces.length;
    var output = LE64(count);
    for (var i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        output += LE64(pieces[i].length);
        output += pieces[i];
    }
    return output;
}

What this means is that you'd want your final result to use something like PAE to encode all of the pieces into the $data function when creating AND verifying your HMAC tags. Don't forget to use hash_equals() to compare the two strings.

"56727357","Hmac verification with flask in Python (with reference in PHP and RUBY)","Hey guys I've been working on a way to implement HMAC verification in python with flask for the selly.gg merchant website.
So selly's dev documentation give these following examples to verify HMAC signatures (in PHP and ruby): https://developer.selly.gg/?php#signing-validating 
(code below:)
PHP:
<?php
        $signature = hash_hmac('sha512', json_encode($_POST), $secret);
        if hash_equals($signature, $signatureFromHeader) {
            // Webhook is valid 
        }
?>

RUBY:
signature = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(OpenSSL::Digest.new('sha512'), secret, payload.to_json)
is_valid_signature = ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.secure_compare(request.headers['X-Selly-Signature'], signature)

So, so far what I could figure out: They don't encode with base64 (like shopify and others do), it uses SHA-512, it encodes the secret code alongside json response data and finally the request header is 'X-Selly-Signature'
I've made the following code so far (based on shopify's code for HMAC signing https://help.shopify.com/en/api/getting-started/webhooks):
SECRET = ""secretkeyhere""
def verify_webhook(data, hmac_header):
    digest = hmac.new(bytes(SECRET, 'ascii'), bytes(json.dumps(data), 'utf8'), hashlib.sha512).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(digest, hmac_header)
try:
    responsebody = request.json #line:22
    status = responsebody['status']#line:25
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    return not_found()
print(""X Selly sign: "" + request.headers.get('X-Selly-Signature'))
verified = verify_webhook(responsebody, request.headers.get('X-Selly-Signature'))
print(verified)

However selly has a webhook simulator, and even with the proper secret key and valid requests, the verify_webhook will always return False. I tried contacting Selly support, but they couldn't help me more than that
You can test the webhook simulator at the following address:
https://selly.io/dashboard/{your account}/developer/webhook/simulate
","You're nearly right except that you don't need to json.dumps the request data. This will likely introduce changes into output, such as changes to formatting, that won't match the original data meaning the HMAC will fail.
E.g.
{""id"":""fd87d909-fbfc-466c-964a-5478d5bc066a""}

is different to:
{
  ""id"":""fd87d909-fbfc-466c-964a-5478d5bc066a""
}

which is actually:
{x0ax20x20""id"":""fd87d909-fbfc-466c-964a-5478d5bc066a""x0a}

A hash will be completely different for the two inputs.
See how json.loads and json.dumps will modify the formatting and therefore the hash:
http_data = b'''{
    ""id"":""fd87d909-fbfc-466c-964a-5478d5bc066a""
}
'''
print(http_data)
h = hashlib.sha512(http_data).hexdigest()
print(h)
py_dict = json.loads(http_data) # deserialise to Python dict
py_str = json.dumps(py_dict) # serialise to a Python str
py_bytes = json.dumps(py_dict).encode('utf-8') # encode to UTF-8 bytes
print(py_str)
h2 = hashlib.sha512(py_bytes).hexdigest()
print(h2)

Output:
b'{\n    ""id"":""fd87d909-fbfc-466c-964a-5478d5bc066a""\n}\n'
364325098....
{""id"": ""fd87d909-fbfc-466c-964a-5478d5bc066a""}
9664f687a....

It doesn't help that Selly's PHP example shows something similar. In fact, the Selly PHP example is useless as the data won't be form encoded anyway, so the data won't be in $_POST!
Here's my little Flask example:
import hmac
import hashlib
from flask import Flask, request, Response

app = Flask(__name__)

php_hash = ""01e5335ed340ef3f211903f6c8b0e4ae34c585664da51066137a2a8aa02c2b90ca13da28622aa3948b9734eff65b13a099dd69f49203bc2d7ae60ebee9f5d858""
secret = ""1234ABC"".encode(""ascii"") # returns a byte object

@app.route(""/"", methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def selly():
    request_data = request.data # returns a byte object
    hm = hmac.new(secret, request_data, hashlib.sha512)
    sig = hm.hexdigest()

    resp = f""""""req: {request_data}
    sig: {sig}
    match: {sig==php_hash}""""""

    return Response(resp, mimetype='text/plain')

app.run(debug=True)

Note the use of request.data to get the raw byte input and the simple use of encode on the secret str to get the encoded bytes (instead of using the verbose bytes() instantiation).
This can be tested with:
curl -X ""POST"" ""http://localhost:5000/"" \
 -H 'Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8' \
 -d ""{\""id\"":\""fd87d909-fbfc-466c-964a-5478d5bc066a\""}""

I also created a bit of PHP to validate both languages create the same result:
<?php
    header('Content-Type: text/plain');
    $post = file_get_contents('php://input');
    print $post;
    $signature = hash_hmac('sha512', $post, ""1234ABC"");
    print $signature;
?>

How can i implement this thing in my code. (I am using VB 6)
Re-phrasing my question: How is password converted into 2 elements HMAC_key and encryption_key?

Let's see if I can explain further..
Encryption software used is CryptoSys while decryptionis done by CodeIgnitor..which is not working
So the difference I can see between the two is that codeignitor is expecting an HMAC authmessage when decrypting while the encryption does not prepend it the final message. So how can i do that? I am using VB6 for encryption.

So far I have come to the conclusion that there could be 2 key-derivation function a pb-kdf or a h-kdf.
The h-kdf authentication in particular works as follows:

A password is enterd by user
Based on this password and a random IV, an HMAC key is generated using HKDF and SHA-512 digest algo.
This HMAC key is saved and also expanded and then using IV/salt encrypts the plaintext message.
The IV is pre-pended to the plain-text message and base64 encoded.
The HMAC key is then pre-pended to the final message gereated in step 4.

So basically hkdf does not convert a key into 2 elements but only uses the basic key generated to generate other keys (and HMAC key is the original key used to generate other keys) now my question becomes...
Is there any vb6 library that uses hkdf and sha-512? As far as i have researched, Chilkat and CryptoSys APIs are only pbkdf based..Am I correct?

"50849179","Implementing a side channel timing attack","I'm working on a project implementing a side channel timing attack in C on HMAC. I've done so by computing the hex encoded tag and brute forcing byte-by-byte by taking advantage of strcmp's timing optimization. So for every digit in my test tag, I calculate the amount of time it takes for every hex char to verify. I take the hex char that corresponds to the highest amount of time calculated and infer that it is the correct char in the tag and move on to the next byte. However, strcmp's timing is very unpredictable. Although it is easy to see the timing differences between comparing two equal strings and two totally different strings, I'm having difficulty finding the char that takes my test string the most time to compute when every other string I'm comparing to is very similar (only differing by 1 byte).
The changeByte method below takes in customTag, which is the tag that has been computed up to that point in time and attempts to find the correct byte corresponding to index. changeByte is called n time where n=length of the tag. hexTag is a global variable that is the correct tag. timeCompleted stores the average time taken to compute the testTag at each of the hex characters for a char position. Any help would be appreciated, thank you for your time.

","I'm not sure if it's the main problem, but you add seconds to microseconds directly as though 1us == 1s. It will give wrong results when number of seconds in startTime and endTime differs.

double startTime=(double)start.tv_sec + (double)start.tv_usec/1000000;

","How about this modification?
Reason of issue:
Both value and key of Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(value, key) are ""String"" or ""Byte[]"". In your script, when var kDate    = hash( dateStamp, kSecret ); is run, kDate is the byte array. But when var kRegion  = hash( regionName,  kDate ); is run, regionName and kDate are ""String"" and ""Byte[]"", respectively. By this, after var kRegion  = hash( regionName,  kDate );, the result is not the same with that of jsSHA.
Modification points:

In order to avoid this, for example, please convert ""String"" to ""Byte[]"".

Modified script:
function sample() {
  var key = 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY';
  var dateStamp = '20150830';
  var regionName = 'us-east-1';
  var serviceName = 'iam';
  var kSecret = 'AWS4' + key;

  regionName = Utilities.newBlob(regionName).getBytes(); // Added
  serviceName = Utilities.newBlob(serviceName).getBytes(); // Added
  var value = Utilities.newBlob('aws4_request').getBytes(); // Added

  var kDate    = hash( dateStamp, kSecret );
  var kRegion  = hash( regionName,  kDate );
  var kService = hash( serviceName, kRegion );
  var kSigning = hash( value, kService );
  return kSigning;
}

function hash( payload, key ) {
  return Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(payload, key);
  // return Utilities.computeHmacSignature(Utilities.MacAlgorithm.HMAC_SHA_256, payload, key) // You can also use this.
}

Result:
kDate: 0138c7a6cbd60aa727b2f653a522567439dfb9f3e72b21f9b25941a42f04a7cd

","In Java there are no unsigned types so you cannot avoid negative values in binary data. It's not the problem.
One problem you have is in byteArrayToString(). toHexString() does not left-pad with zeros so values 0..15 don't output two chars but just one. I'd use something like String.format(""%02x"", b) instead. See also: How to convert a byte array to a hex string in Java?

","Yes, your web api service can send back multiple schemes in the WWW-Authenticate challenge. In your case it can send back 'bearer' and 'hmac' for example.
See also this question for more info on using multiple schemes.
BTW, it's not your web api service that supports Resource Owner Password flow. The client uses this flow to get a token from the authorization server that it can use in a bearer scheme with your service (resource server). HTH.

Since its a fun project i wanted to try out HMAC-Authentication but I dont know how to set it up in the frontend so that I dont have the user password stored in the client side.
This is how I thought how to implement hmac:
1.The client gets the username and password from an HTML form and builds the HMAC with the user password as the secret: 
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', user.password)
  hmac.update(querypath) //adds the path name as message
  hmac.digest('hex')

2.The client puts the hmac in the Authorization header and sends it along the username in plaintext like this to the API:
  Authorization: username:[digest]

3.The server calculates the hash itself (looks up the user,gets pw etc.) and compares it to the one that it got from the client/request
if(hmacFromRequest === hmacCalculatedFromServer){
   //authenticated
}else{
//not authenticated
//throw new Error or reply to client
}

My Question is basically now what do I send back to the client? Does the client need to save the password somewhere to calculate the hmac? Should i just put the hmac in localStorage and get it everytime I make a request?

Base64 decoding the secret (as suggested in the pro docs) 
Base16 encoding (and lowercasing) the signature before Base64 encoding it as suggested in this this answer
Using the full path ""https://api.coinbase.com/v2/accounts""
Using just the resource path: /accounts
(Edit based on comments): Also tried /v2/accounts and /v2/accounts/
Numerous variations on the path etc.

What am I doing wrong? 
Edit:
From the pro docs:

Remember to first base64-decode the alphanumeric secret string (resulting in 64 bytes) before using it as the key for HMAC. Also, base64-encode the > digest output before sending in the header.

(Emphasis mine) 
I notice that the byte_size/1 of my decoded_secret ends up with only 24 bytes: 
decoded_secret = Base.decode64!(request.secret)
IO.puts byte_size(decoded_secret) # => 24

Not 64 as the docs specify. Still digging into this.

"55261040","How could HMAC comparison ever not be constant-time in Python?","Python has a method specifically for comparing HMAC to prevent timing attacks: https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/hmac.html#hmac.compare_digest
And I read about timing attacks here: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/74547/timing-attack-against-hmac-in-authenticated-encryption
My question is, how could it possibly ever not be constant-time? It would be necessary to calculate the actual HMAC in order to compare it, and it's not like you could calculate the digest 1 character at a time, right? At the end, it would just be a simple string comparison, which is 2 orders of magnitude faster than the actual HMAC calculation in my tests. So where exactly is the attack surface here? Could someone please give an example of exactly where the actual vulnerability is if I don't use hmac.compare_digest()?
","
At the end, it would just be a simple string comparison, which is 2 orders of magnitude faster than the actual HMAC calculation in my tests.

But it is not constant time. Just because they are done fast doesn't mean the difference is not measurable. For bytes values, Python first tests for equal length and equal first bytes before using memcmp to test the rest.  For strings, Python compares length, then kind (if the string uses 1, 2 or 4 bytes per character), then also uses memcmp.
The Linux manpage for memcmp explicitly states:

Do not use memcmp() to compare security critical data, such as
         cryptographic secrets, because the required CPU time depends on the
         number of equal bytes.  Instead, a function that performs comparisons
         in constant time is required.  Some operating systems provide such a
         function (e.g., NetBSD's consttime_memequal()), but no such function
         is specified in POSIX.  On Linux, it may be necessary to implement
         such a function oneself.)

A sufficiently determined attacker can exploit this weakness to figure out what hash you have stored vs the hash of the data it is sending.
Timing attacks make it possible to forge signatures. Say, a service stores authorization information in a token shared with the client. If the client could alter this token, they could gain access they would not otherwise have. To protect against this, the token is signed using an HMAC signature, letting the server verify the returned token before accepting it as valid. If the authorization data doesn't match the signature, the token is rejected.
If the server does this:
auth_data, signature = split_token(token)
expected = hmac_signature(auth_data)
if signature == expected:
    # ...

then an attacker can detect how many characters of a forged signature match the expected signature, and adjust accordingly. They start with XXXXX:000000..., then try XXXXX:1000000..., etc. until the time taken by the service increases, indicating that they have a matching first character. Then the second character can be altered, until the full signature matches.

Here $sb5 is the Base64-encoded HMAC-value which correponds to the Java-code result.
There are two flaws in your code:

The values for $sb and $keyToEncode were confused.
The PHP-method hash_mac has a fourth parameter $raw_output which is by default FALSE. When set to FALSE the result is returned as lowercase hexadecimal string otherwise as binary data (http://php.net/manual/en/function.hash-hmac.php). Since your PHP-code uses the default value of $raw_output (i.e. FALSE), the HMAC is returned as a hexadecimal string and must first be converted to binary data before it can be Base64-encoded. For the conversion the PHP-method hex2bin has to be used.

Btw, you can also use the $raw_output = TRUE variant. Then, no conversion with hex2bin is necessary. However, if you want to display the HMAC as hexadecimal string the PHP-method bin2hex has to be used: 
<?php
$sb = 'c0814229c201ab1022070741d15eda7af2189db64a2c88699c6481dbb83521afd8640d9af6d984602037d2e4f90c4f9a12915899290d944f385192b658829ec1';
$keyToEncode = '4a275929e0eba4445bc7f9a80c6361a2351119a27b51eebb2c259f68f72efd5f';
$sb3 = hash_hmac('sha256',$sb, $keyToEncode, TRUE); // HMAC-value as binary data
$sb4 = base64_encode($sb3);                         // Base64-encoded HMAC-value
print ""HMAC-value (hexadecimal string): "".bin2hex($sb3).""\n"".""HMAC-value (Base64-encoded): "".$sb4;

Hi, Yet another OAuth question.
I'm working on a Delphi OAuth library. I have OAuth2 all done and dusted, but am having a couple of little issues with OAuth1.0a, and generating an HMAC.
Specifically:
I have tested that my code generates a correct signature base string, as per the test case in RFC5849 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.1
I have tested that my implementation of SHA1 and SHA-1HMAC passes all the following tests:
Test: FIPS 180-2 C.1 and RFC3174 7.3 TEST1
Test: FIPS 180-2 C.2 and RFC3174 7.3 TEST2
Test: RFC3174 7.3 TEST4
Test: FIPS 198a A.1
Test: FIPS 198a A.2
Test: FIPS 198a A.3
Test: FIPS 198a A.4

I have checked that my HMAC generates the correct values in(!) Wikipedia:
HMAC_SHA1("""", """")   = fbdb1d1b18aa6c08324b7d64b71fb76370690e1d
HMAC_SHA1(""key"", ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"")   = de7c9b85b8b78aa6bc8a7a36f70a90701c9db4d9

So, now I need to generate the digest, which should just be a base 64 encode. My base64 encoding seems OK:
 '' => ''
 'f' => 'Zg=='
 'fo' => 'Zm8='
 'foo' => 'Zm9v'
 'foob' => 'Zm9vYg=='
 'fooba' => 'Zm9vYmE='
 'foobar' => 'Zm9vYmFy'

So, I then put it all together, and attempt to generate an HMAC-SHA1:
function OAuth1TestHMACSHA1Digest: boolean;

For example, the function should be generating de7c9b85b8b78aa6bc8a7a36f70a90701c9db4d9 for text ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"" with key ""key"", but it generates d3c446dbd70f5db3693f63f96a5931d49eaa5bab instead.
Could anyone point out my mistakes?
The function:
const int block_size = 64;
const int hash_output_size = 20;
const int ipadVal = 0x36;
const int opadVal = 0x5C;
std::string HMAC::getHMAC(const std::string &text)

// return outer_hash

}

edit: In the line
std::string zeros = std::string(appended_zeros, '0');

'0' should be 0 instead : int instead of char. Thanks to @Igor Tandetnik for that.
","Ok..so a little look around lead me to HMAC produces wrong results. Turns out, I was doing the same mistake of using hex as ascii.
I used a function to convert the inner_hash from hex to ascii and then everything turned out perfect.

std::string HMAC::getHMAC(const std::string &text)

// check if key length is block_size
// else, append 0x00 till the length of new key is block_size

    std::cout << ""\nAppending "" << appended_zeros << "" 0s to key"";
    std::string zeros = std::string(appended_zeros, 0);
    newkey = key + zeros;
}
if (key_length > block_size)
{
    SHA1 sha1;
    newkey = sha1(key);
}

// calculate hash of newkey XOR ipad and newkey XOR opad
std::string keyXipad = newkey;
std::string keyXopad = newkey;
for (int i = 0; i < 64; i++)
{
    keyXipad[i] ^= ipadVal;
    keyXopad[i] ^= opadVal;

Thank you for taking the time to look at this issue!
","First, don't build your own HMAC routine here. Use CCHmac. It's built-in and handles HMAC+MD5 correctly.
If at all possible, I recommend going to the API documentation rather than trying to reverse engineer another code base. There are lots of little things going on in the PHP that you may be overlooking; an API doc should explain all of those.
If the PHP code is the only reference you have, then you should break down each piece and see where it's going wrong. For instance, verify that you are getting the auth data in the same form. Then confirm that each program, given the same auth data generates the same HMAC. Then confirm that given the same HMAC, each program generates the same response. Etc. Somewhere you are doing something differently. Make sure that you're using Base64 vs raw data in the same places (PHP devs tend to treat Base64 strings as though they were actually raw data, which causes confusion when coming over to ObjC).
And of course you should examine the server logs to validate that your final request matches the PHP requests.

In this case the client sends a password and a one time password to the server. The server knows the secret, calculates the current hotp and compares the values it receives. So far, so good. With plaintext this works perfectly fine  and the calculated values are the same I get when I use the iOS App ""OTP Auth"". But there is also the possibility to calculate the OTP in combination with base32. So I added a few lines to encode the plaintext to base32 but now the output in not correct.
Let's assume we're using the secret ""1234"" so the plaintext output would be ""110366"". That's working. But if I'm encoding the secret to base32 the output should be ""807244"" but my program calculates ""896513"". Anybody know why this is happening?
I've already tried to use different secrets and checked it on different apps. Always the same result.

    one_time_password = otp

I expect 807244 as the output but the output is 896513
","First, it's important to point out that the result of secret.encode('UTF-8') has exactly the same type as the result of base64.b32encode(bSecret) (and for that matter base64.b64encode(bSecret)) -- they all return bytes objects. Also worth noting is that the implementation of hmac in Python has no mention of base64/base32 encoding. So the short answer is that your expected result of 807244 is only valid if the shared secret is a base64/UTF-8 encoded blob.
This quick snippet shows that really you can give any bytes you like to hotp and it will come up with some result (because hotp is called multiple times in the example, counter is changed)
# ... everything from your example above ...
secret = ""1234""
secret_bytes = secret.encode(""UTF-8"")
secret_bytes
>>> b'1234'
b32_secret = base64.b32encode(bSecret)
b32_secret
>>> b'GEZDGNA='
b64_secret = base64.b64encode(bSecret)
b64_secret
>>> b'MTIzNA=='
hotp(secret_bytes, counter)  # just a UTF-8 blob works
>>> '110366'
hotp(b32_secret, counter)  # base32/UTF-8 also works
>>> '896513'
hotp(b64_secret, counter)  # base64/UTF-8 works as well
>>> '806744'

If you have more detail of why you expected 807244 for a base32/UTF8 blob, I'll be happy to amend this answer.

Instead of translating the secret to base32, the secret must be a Base32 decoded value. Also instead of encoding this value, it must be decoded (""base64.b32decode(bytes(saved_secret, 'utf-8'))"")

"52845759","Problems with header fields in django rest framework HMAC module?","So I've been trying to utilize the djangorestframework-hmac module (https://github.com/aaronlelevier/django-rest-framework-hmac) to secure a REST API with HMAC.  But I'm running into what would seem to be a fundamental problem with it: as with most HMAC schemes, the client needs to put the message signature in a header field named 'Signature', but the problem is that header field names get translated by Django ('Signature' becomes 'HTTP_SIGNATURE').
But I can see in the code for django-restframework-hmac that the server is looking for a header field called 'Signature'. Now the module comes with an example, which works, but in the example, the client is running Django, which I believe may somehow be skirting around the header-field translation problem.  But what if the client is not using django?  How could the client possibly get his header fields seen by the server?  Is there something I'm missing here about the way django uses header field names?
Just to be explicit, here is the kind of request I'm making to test the client side:
headers = {'Key': api_key, 'Signature': sig, 'Timestamp': t}
DJANGO_URL = '127.0.0.1:8000/testrest/'
r = requests.get(DJANGO_URL, headers=headers)

But on the django server side, if I print out the request.META dictionary, the key corresponding to each of my header fields is altered ('Signature'->'HTTP_SIGNATURE', etc).  Yet the django HMAC code is looking for a field named 'Signature' in the request.META.  This behavior is even there in the Django doc.
I'm just wondering if this is a bug in the django hmac library, or if I'm not sending my request properly or something.
","It looks like a bug in djangorestframework-hmac
Someone created identical issue on github
https://github.com/aaronlelevier/django-rest-framework-hmac/issues/4
And I noticed that tests in this lib use mocked requests so header is never rewritten by django and the bug was unnoticed

this approach facebook signed request email
this too http://sunilarora.org/parsing-signedrequest-parameter-in-python-bas/
using python 2.7 and 3.2

from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes, hmac
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
h = hmac.HMAC(key, hashes.SHA256(), backend=default_backend())
h.update(message)
signature = h.finalize()
replacing -_ chars with +/ a la Facebook signed_request Invalid via a simple replace(""-"", ""+"").replace(""_"", ""/"").
I had hopes for this one but I can't seem to verify a sig even if it lacks any of the above symbols like this one for example GlU46mFitdvtOnm56aLR3xQ1RUBzoCY0k2u1kMjBdQA.ey[...] ..so.. yeah..
I've attempted different string encodings (utf-8 / ascii) on the signature / payload
different hashing algorithms (sha512 / md5 ..)
hashing the base64 strings over decoding them from base64 first
regenerating my app secret (I've double checked that the app ID that appears in the payload references the correct app, and thus secret)

So far I've been unable to produce the same signature that comes on given signed request(s) .. so every facebook message is considered invalid (less than ideal!). 
How on earth does facebook generate these signatures? How do I generate them correctly (or incorrectly, if it matches facebook :P I'm not fussy) in order to validate them?

","You got the same result in both cases. It's just encoded differently. The openssl command encodes it as hex and your function uses base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString() to encode it as base64.
Here's a small Python 2 snippet showing this:
>>> x = ""c8db56825ae71d6d79447849e617115f4a920fa2acdcab2b053c4b2838bd6b71""

True

For some reason I'm failing to create the correct Signature. Which is created by using the SigningKey and SingingString as input into an HMACSha256 function, specifically the function highlighted on this page https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-v4-examples.html#signature-v4-examples-java.
But for some reason, I cannot produce the signature that AWS says will be created here on this page.: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-calculate-signature.html
(5d672d79c15b13162d9279b0855cfba6789a8edb4c82c400e06b5924a6f2b5d7)
Despite using their function, their Strings as input, and double checking my work. What am I missing?
Are you supposed to use a different function for these Strings or byte[]?
I feel like I'm missing something, and I don't know where to reconcle this confusion because from my code and what I see on these pages I seem to be doing the right thing.
I'm especially confused because when I pasted the String from their site into my code to see if it would convert properly it did not, despite using their same Hmac function (which did work for creating every other hash string posted on their site).
","The hex representation of the date, region, service, and signing keys is shown for illustration, because the keys contain bytes that do not represent printable characters.
But you appear to be hex-encoding your signing key before using it to sign the request.  Don't do that.  You will want to hex-encode it only for viewing/debugging.  The actual signing key should be retained and used in its original binary/byte form.

Use the digest (binary format) for the key derivation. Most languages have functions to compute either a binary format hash, commonly called a digest, or a hex-encoded hash, called a hexdigest. The key derivation requires that you use a binary-formatted digest.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-calculate-signature.html

The canonical request hash in the string-to-sign is used in hex-encoded form, as is the final signature.  The key derivation is all binary.

Once the client has been authenticated, should I be creating a auth token (hashing the clients public key + nonce) then storing it in the db and then with each api request (for other endpoints) hash the requesting client's public key and the nonce and comparing the two?
Or should I be generating some auth token after authentication and send it to the client as well as storing it, then require them to send it back with every request and compare?
Also, my plan here was to get a nonce before each request. Does this seem excessive?
Any help explaining options on how to proceed from here would be greatly appreciated.

Private Function hash_HMACMD5(ByVal sTextToHash As String, ByVal 
sSharedSecretKey As String)

Dim asc As Object, enc As Object
Dim TextToHash() As Byte
Dim SharedSecretKey() As Byte
Set asc = CreateObject(""System.Text.UTF8Encoding"")
Set enc = CreateObject(""System.Security.Cryptography.HMACMD5"")

 TextToHash = asc.Getbytes_4(sTextToHash)
 SharedSecretKey = asc.Getbytes_4(sSharedSecretKey)
 enc.Key = SharedSecretKey

 Dim bytes() As Byte
 bytes = enc.ComputeHash_2((TextToHash))
 hash_HMACMD5 = Base64Encode(bytes)

 Set asc = Nothing
 Set enc = Nothing

 End Function

So, I was hoping someone out there might be able to point me in the right direction ?
Thanks In advance for any help.

I've traced all the code through, and I can't see any thing that would indicate something different is going on. As mentioned below, there is a import line
import android.util.Base64;

The call to create the hash is :
String hMACHash = new MASecurity().getHMACHash(str, str2);

MASecurity Class is :
import android.util.Base64;
import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.security.InvalidKeyException;
import javax.crypto.Mac;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

public class MASecurity {
private static final String TAG = ""MASecurity"";

public String getHMACHash(String str, String str2) {
    return base64EncodedStringFromBytes(hmacMD5(str, str2));
}

private String base64EncodedStringFromBytes(byte[] bArr) {
    return Base64.encodeToString(bArr, 2);
}

public byte[] hmacMD5(String str, String str2) {
    byte[] bArr = null;
    try {
        Mac instance = Mac.getInstance(""HmacMD5"");
        instance.init(new SecretKeySpec(str.getBytes(), ""HmacMD5""));
        bArr = instance.doFinal(str2.getBytes());
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
        MALog.m8401e(TAG, e.getLocalizedMessage());
    } catch (InvalidKeyException e2) {
        MALog.m8401e(TAG, e2.getLocalizedMessage());
    }
    return bArr;
}

The input values are correct, as they are logged whilst the app is running.
Hope this helps ??

I face an issue with the kregion signature in the example. While I can confirm that the AWS example is valid using an online signature tool, I am never able to reproduce the example output using any Google app script. As HMAC SHA256 signature works fine for an earlier part of the example (kdate), the issue seems to come from the way data is stored or used.
What works for kDate is the following with parts from another stackoverflow entry to convert byte array to hex string and with the help of Google apps script documentation for computeHmacSha256Signature:
var input=""20120215"";
var key=""AWS4""+""wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"";//Do not worry, this is an example key, not my actual key

Using an online converter, i can confirm that the key is well converted. Yet, the output signature is still wrong.
I was wondering whether it could be because the key bytes are stored as doubles. So, I tried the following with no difference on the output signature:
var input=""us-east-1"";
var key=[0x96, 0x9f, 0xbb, 0x94, 0xfe, 0xb5, 0x42, 0xb7, 0x1e, 0xde, 0x6f, 0x87, 0xfe, 0x4d, 0x5f, 0xa2, 0x9c, 0x78, 0x93, 0x42, 0xb0, 0xf4, 0x07, 0x47, 0x46, 0x70, 0xf0, 0xc2, 0x48, 0x9e, 0x0a, 0x0d];
var signature=Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(input,key);
signature=signature.map(function(chr){return (chr+256).toString(16).slice(-2)}).join('');

Then I thought maybe both parameters of the computeHmacSha256Signature function need to be byte arrays:

Logger.log(signature);

The above leads to error ""Cannot convert Array to (class)[]."". Which seems to indicate that the computeHmacSha256Signature function is more comfortable with the string input.
I got yet another invalid kRegion output signature by using the output signature of kDate without converting it to a string:
var input=""20120215"";
var key=""AWS4""+""wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"";
var signature=Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(input,key);
input=""us-east-1"";
key=signature;
signature = Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(input,key);
signature=signature.map(function(chr){return (chr+256).toString(16).slice(-2)}).join('');
Logger.log(signature);//non-valid c3b37a4dc2e085fcd35411493526592a33ef1d7d38454a25e574a34fe190d7be

I tried many other conversions with no success.

You want to achieve the result of the sample scripts of ""Examples of How to Derive a Signing Key for Signature Version 4"" using Google Apps Script.

In your case, you want to retrieve the value of f4780e2d9f65fa895f9c67b32ce1baf0b0d8a43505a000a1a9e090d414db404d from the following sample values as kSigning.
key = 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY'
dateStamp = '20120215'
regionName = 'us-east-1'
serviceName = 'iam'



If my understanding is correct, how about this sample script?
Important points:

At Google Apps Script, the data which was encrypted by Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature() is the bytes array of the signed hexadecimal. In the sample scripts, the bytes array is converted to the unsigned hexadecimal. So it is required to be converted.


But, when the byte array is created by Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(), the created byte array can be used for Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature() without converting.


From above situation, the sample script for Google Apps Script can be made as follows.
Sample script:
In this sample script, in order to check whether the script is correct, I tested the script using the sample values at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-v4-examples.html.
function myFunction() {
  // These are the sample values of https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-v4-examples.html
  var key = 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY';
  var dateStamp = '20120215';
  var regionName = 'us-east-1';
  var serviceName = 'iam';

  // I prepared the following script.
  var kDate = Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(dateStamp, ""AWS4"" + key);
  var kRegion = Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(Utilities.newBlob(regionName).getBytes(), kDate);
  var kService = Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(Utilities.newBlob(serviceName).getBytes(), kRegion);
  var kSigning = Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(Utilities.newBlob(""aws4_request"").getBytes(), kService);
  kSigning = kSigning.map(function(e) {return (""0"" + (e < 0 ? e + 256 : e).toString(16)).slice(-2)}).join("""");

  Logger.log(kSigning) // Result
}


About above script, for example, kDate is the byte array. So regionName is required to be converted to the byte array. Please be careful this.

Result:
f4780e2d9f65fa895f9c67b32ce1baf0b0d8a43505a000a1a9e090d414db404d

This value is the same with the sample value. By this, it was found that the prepared script returns the correct value.

"48107204","What causes the discrepancy from HMAC functions in R vs Python when using .digest()?","I am trying to write some functions to connect to IBM Cloud Object Storage using AWS Version 4 signing protocols.  There's some boilerplate code for doing this that works in Python over here, but when I try to convert the code to R I find myself in a conundrum.
When using HMAC functions in R & Python the .hexdigest() method yields identical outputs for the same string in both languages:
# Python
import hmac
import hashlib
>>> hmac.new(""key"", ""message"".encode('utf-8'), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
'6e9ef29b75fffc5b7abae527d58fdadb2fe42e7219011976917343065f58ed4a

# R
library(digest)
> hmac(""key"", enc2utf8(""message""), ""sha256"")
[1] ""6e9ef29b75fffc5b7abae527d58fdadb2fe42e7219011976917343065f58ed4a""

If you use the .digest() method in Python from the crypto library - which the code from AWS/IBM suggests - then you get ASCII output.  I am able to approximate this ASCII output in R by changing the hmac() output to raw and then converting to character.  Below you can see it is not exactly the same - though it is close. 
# Python
>>> hmac.new(""key"", ""message"".encode('utf-8'), hashlib.sha256).digest()
""n\x9e\xf2\x9bu\xff\xfc[z\xba\xe5'\xd5\x8f\xda\xdb/\xe4.r\x19\x01\x19v\x91sC\x06_X\xedJ""

# R
> rawToChar(hmac(""key"", ""message"", ""sha256"", raw = T))
[1] ""n\x9e\xf2\x9bu\xff\xfc[z\xba\xe5'Տ\xda\xdb/\xe4.r\031\001\031v\x91sC\006_X\xedJ""

What is causing the discrepancy here?  The source code and docs for .digest() says that it returns a string of 8-bit data that may contain non-ASCII bytes.  How can I replicate this output in R? 
Ultimately I believe this is what is causing my signatures to fail when trying to authenticate with IBM Cloud Object Storage.  Any help or alternative suggestions for HMAC libraries in Python/R would be greatly appreciated!

"37209712","Python3, hmac returns wrong output?! ARM71, 32bit","I've asked another question here recently, regarding python, flask with a badsignature exception for sessions (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37158432/python-flask-session-cookie-bad-signature-exception) , and I've been working with this problem now for a while, an seen another problem.
When signing a client-side session for my flask application hmac is used to hash the signature. On my personal computer this works fine, but when moving this to the embedded device built for this application hmac occasionally fails to hash the key (wrong output), which makes the session data invalid.
I made a small test program running the hmac.new() & .update() multiple times(10000) without any errors (on the target machine). But when the call is made inside the flask application the error occur in about 60% of the calls. 
The call is made inside the ""derive_key"" method of itsdangerous.py and it looks like this:
  def derive_key(self):
        """"""This method is called to derive the key.  If you're unhappy with
        the default key derivation choices you can override them here.
        Keep in mind that the key derivation in itsdangerous is not intended
        to be used as a security method to make a complex key out of a short
        password.  Instead you should use large random secret keys.
        """"""
        salt = want_bytes(self.salt)
        if self.key_derivation == 'concat':
            return self.digest_method(salt + self.secret_key).digest()
        elif self.key_derivation == 'django-concat':
            return self.digest_method(salt + b'signer' +
                self.secret_key).digest()
        elif self.key_derivation == 'hmac':
            mac = hmac.new(self.secret_key, digestmod=self.digest_method)
            print(""mac1:"", binascii.hexlify(mac.digest()))  #1
            mac.update(salt)
            print(""mac2:"", binascii.hexlify(mac.digest()))  #2
            return mac.digest()
        elif self.key_derivation == 'none':
            return self.secret_key
        else:
            raise TypeError('Unknown key derivation method')

digestmod = hashlib.sha1
With the secret_key = b'testing' and salt=b'cookie-session' the expected output is:
mac1: b'6ab6fc891eefd3b78743ea28b1803811561a7c9b'
mac2: b'd58bd52b4ced54374ea5baca0b6aa52b0e03af74'

But many times these values differ. 
I've also seen that the output of mac1 & mac2 is equal! like the salt did not modify the result.
I have also asked this question here:
https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1808
This application is running on an ARM7, 32bit.
All libraries installed using yocto.
UPDATE:
For every call to derive_key() I also print salt and key: The output for a couple of requests is the following:

I added the ""OK!"" and ""NOT OKAY!"" so that it is easier for you to see which executions went wrong.
(I also see that it, in this example, is not 60% fails. )
In the output above, Only the ""Open session""-event failed. So i tried it again to see if it is only when saving the session, but it happens for Save-session also..

Converted to ruby, this gives us :

urlPath = ""/resize""

hmac = OpenSSL::HMAC.digest(digest, signKey, ""#{urlPath}#{urlQuery}"")
pp Base64.strict_encode64(hmac)

We're almost there , but there a slight issue, don't know if it is due to openssl or base64, but for example when I get this with go :
wClkWcUvI9ILs7noAr_HtnKpRCeeWBXE1Ne2C99sAco
I get the following with the ruby version :
wClkWcUvI9ILs7noAr/HtnKpRCeeWBXE1Ne2C99sAco=
With ruby, whatever's done, it ends up with a =
While go uses underscore, ruby use backslashes (this last one statement might be the result of pure unawareness about specific ruby parts, but let's just detail the issue)
What should be done to get the same output with both versions ? Why do we get a close but not exact result between those languages ?
Thanks a lot for the reply
","The Go code uses the URL safe variant of base64 encoding where your Ruby code uses the normal version. The URL safe version uses - and _ instead of + and / so that it is safe for use in URLs. The Ruby version also includes padding (the = at the end).
You can use the URL safe version in Ruby, and you can also specify no padding to get the same result as Go:
Base64.urlsafe_encode64(hmac, false)

","Usually with HMAC signatures the keys are sorted alphabetically first prior to be signed. If you are iterating over a Hash key/value pairs then the iteration order is largely non-deterministic (or should at least be treated as such).
Try sorting your keys first like:

","It seems you made a typo in collecting the data from your hash. You currently use:
msg.keys.map { |k,v| ""#{k}=#{v}"" }.join('&')

but by calling #keys on the hash you'll get an array with only keys.
I guess you meant to type
msg.map { |k,v| ""#{k}=#{v}"" }.join('&')

otherwise you'll lose the values and v is always nil.

Any ideas?
","For the date I'm using
 @date_time = Time.now.iso8601

To create Hmac:
bin_key = Array(keyTest).pack 'H*'

","In PHP code you are using SHA1 and in Swift code - SHA256. These are different hashing algorithms and that's why you're getting different signatures. You should use kCCHmacAlgSHA1 instead.
Also you should avoid using cString API, it's not safe in Swift. It's better to use Data instead.
func digestHMac256(key: String) -> String! {

    guard
        let strData = self.data(using: String.Encoding.utf8),

Also check the string which you're trying to encode. For example:
let toEncode = ""GET&http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mydomain.com%2Fv1%2Fhomepage&customerid%3D1247""

let encoded = toEncode.digestHMac256(key: ""cs_a6twe79rt7aa"")

"49197833","Translate code from JS to CPP","i'm a bit experienced in CPP and totaly new in JS. Have a task in translating code from JS to CPP, i tried something but not clear about what i am doing; hereafter my js code. 
body: json object

xyz: string (suck as: ALgalgw7agw)

const payload = new Buffer(JSON.stringify(body))

const signature = crypto
  .createHmac('sha384', xyz)

1) what is the meaning of this code segment?
2) how can i implement it in cpp?
Thanks so much for your time,
","You are talking about NodeJS, in this case instances of the Buffer class are similar to arrays of integers but correspond to fixed-sized, raw memory allocations. The size of the Buffer is established when it is created and cannot be resized. After that you are transforming it to a Base64 String.
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world', 'ascii');
// Prints: aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=
console.log(buf.toString('base64'));

After that you are creating a hash for the payload, using ""xyz"" variable which is the key to decipher the payload, and then digesting it to a hex. So in the end:
signature = /* hex sha384-with-key encrypted payload */

If you want to translate this JS code to C++ you'd need to use some kind of crypto library (such as OpenSSL) and for the Buffer I think there are built-in functions. 
I suggest you reading this and this to know more about crypto and Buffer classes/functions on NodeJS

"30424405","Is there a specific difference in the one-time-password algorithm when using sha512 to using sha1","I am writing a pam module, that does authentication with one time passwords.
I started writing it with sha512 as algorithm for the hmac and ran into a problem. I also did it with sha1, which works.
The code is at: https://github.com/Ongy/pam_totp
I tested the hmac with sha512, as far as I can tell that is correct, so the error should be in the get_truncate function, which does work with sha1, but not with sha512.
static int get_truncate(const uint8_t * hash, size_t len, char * buffer,
        size_t maxlen)
{
    uint32_t value;
    uint8_t offset;
    offset = hash[len-1] & 0x0F;
    value = *((uint32_t *) (hash+offset));
    value = be32toh(value) & 0x7FFFFFFF;
    value %= 100000000;

    return snprintf(buffer, maxlen, ""%08d"", value);
}

which is called in 
static int get_totp_sha512(const uint8_t * hashdata, size_t len, uint64_t time,
            char * dst, size_t maxlen)
{
    uint8_t buffer[64];
    uint64_t counter = htobe64(time);

    memset(buffer, 0, sizeof(buffer));

    calculate_hmac_sha512(hashdata, len, (uint8_t *) &counter,
                     sizeof(counter), buffer, sizeof(buffer));

    return get_truncate(buffer, sizeof(buffer), dst, maxlen);
}

Most of the relevant code should be in src/main.c.
The rfcs relevent are: 6238 and 4226. (The second one describes the general algorithm, the first one also allows other hashes than sha1)

My implementations of PBKDF2 in PHP, C#, Java, and Ruby.
it's based on PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1.
i googled to find something that help me to make a hash based on PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512.
and i've found this library on github:
therealmagicmike/PBKDF2.NET.
in this library i can define my hash algorithm like HMACSHA1, HMACSHA256, HMACSHA384 or HMACSHA512.
and as you know HMACSHA1 is faster than HMACSHA512. and it's not good in security reasons.
But i've found something that i don't know it's true or not! i've implemented both algorithms in same page and understand that adriancs's algorithm takes longer time than the mike's. and it's not logical as for adriancs's article.
So, i want to know which algorithm is slowest and also which is better?
any help will be appreciated.
Thanks a lot.
","Sorry to find this so late. I'm the author of PBKDF2.NET. The speed difference is due to the equality comparison. The library by Defuse implements a slow-compare function, where I chose to leave any custom comparisons up to the consumer. My reasoning is that I didn't want to create a library with additional non-essential utility functions but rather to provide a proper implementation of the algorithm. Whether or not a particular application requires a slow compare really depends on the application so I excluded this.

I know that I can use a plain old string to .signWith(Algorithm,String) however I've been made aware that using a standard Java String (literally) isn't secure enough. I was using something akin to:
String compactJws = Jwts.builder()
  .setSubject(""Joe"")
  .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS512, ""shared complex passphrase"")
  .compact();

","According to RFC 7518 - JSON Web Algorithms (JWA):

A key of the same size as the hash output (for instance, 256 bits for
  ""HS256"") or larger MUST be used with this algorithm.  (This
  requirement is based on Section 5.3.4 (Security Effect of the HMAC
  Key) of NIST SP 800-117 (sic) [NIST.800-107], which states that the
  effective security strength is the minimum of the security strength
  of the key and two times the size of the internal hash value.)

You must use a key of at least 512 bits with HS512. 
Keys needs to be chosen at random. You can generate the key with MacProvider.generateKey(); or other random generator and distribute it to your servers (for example encoded in base64)
An alternative is using a RSA key pair. You use the private key to sign the token and the public key to verify. The public key can be safely published and used by all services

    const char* pData = stringToSign.c_str();
    unsigned char* result = nullptr;
    unsigned int len = 32;

    int nkeyLen = strlen(pKey);
    int dataLen = strlen(pData);

"57538198","python - hmac new sha1","I am trying to get the same result as this online API service produces.
By entering key as the application key, and secret as the secret produces the following URL:
http://webservices.esd.org.uk/organisations/barrowbc?ApplicationKey=key&Signature=YXWJsGSKnLcENW1vm30EYObbCsA=

I have tried producing the same signature using the following code:
import hmac    
import urllib
import base64
from hashlib import sha1


def sign_url(url,key,secret):
    url = url + 'ApplicationKey=' + key
    signature = hmac.new(secret,url,sha1).digest().encode(""base64"") 
    signature = '&Signature=' + signature
    url = url + signature
    print(url)

sign_url('http://webservices.esd.org.uk/organisations/barrowbc','key','secret')

but this produces:
http://webservices.esd.org.uk/organisations/barrowbcApplicationKey=key&Signature=W//jgV+xdSbTBG6+i1TCGN/Kbsk=

The expected signature is 
YXWJsGSKnLcENW1vm30EYObbCsA=

but my code outputs
W//jgV+xdSbTBG6+i1TCGN/Kbsk=

","Your version is missing the required ? component before the Application= parameter. You probably want to add in a & if there are other parameters, however, and you need to remove the newline that .encode(""base64"") adds to the end of the value:
def sign_url(url, key, secret):
    sep = '&' if '?' in url else '?'
    url = '{}{}ApplicationKey={}'.format(url, sep, key)
    signature = hmac.new(secret, url, sha1).digest().encode(""base64"") 
    return '{}&Signature={}'.format(url, signature[:-1])

I note however that when the URL contains URL-encoded elements then the signature appears to be applied to the URL-decoded version (with + interpreted as spaces), so you really want to add a urllib.unquote_plus() (Python 2) / urllib.parse.unquote_plus() (Python 3) call when signing:
try:
    from urllib.parse import unquote_plus
except ImportError:
    from urlib import unquote_plus

def sign_url(url, key, secret):
    sep = '&' if '?' in url else '?'
    url = '{}{}ApplicationKey={}'.format(url, sep, key)
    signature = hmac.new(secret, unquote_plus(url), sha1).digest().encode(""base64"") 
    return '{}&Signature={}'.format(url, signature[:-1])

I've confirmed that this is what their PHP example code does and verified sample query parameters in the online signature tool, e.g. when entering the path and parameters foo%20bar?foo%20bar into the tool, CCuMYpCDznH4vIv95+NrN+RHEK0= is produced as the signature, but using foo+bar?foo+bar produces the exact same signature even though + should only be decoded as a space in form data.
I'd parse out the URL, add the ApplicationKey parameter to the parsed parameters, and then construct a new URL to sign.
Here's a version that does just that, and works both on Python 2 and on Python 3:
import hmac
import base64
from hashlib import sha1

try:
    # Python 3
    from urllib.parse import parse_qsl, unquote_plus, urlencode, urlparse
except ImportError:
    # Python 2
    from urlparse import urlparse, parse_qsl
    from urllib import unquote_plus, urlencode

def sign_url(url, key, secret):
    parsed = urlparse(url)
    query = parse_qsl(parsed.query)
    query.append(('ApplicationKey', key))
    to_sign = unquote_plus(parsed._replace(query=urlencode(query)).geturl())

    if not isinstance(secret, bytes):
        secret = secret.encode()
    if not isinstance(to_sign, bytes):
        to_sign = to_sign.encode()
    signature = base64.b64encode(hmac.new(secret, to_sign, sha1).digest())
    if not isinstance(signature, str):
        signature = signature.decode()

Because there are few libraries for cryptography in VBScript, I'm using server side Javascript and the crypto-js library from https://code.google.com/archive/p/crypto-js/
I've tried to translate the PHP code example from Facebook's docs at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/gamesonfacebook/login#parsingsr into Javascript. I can generate an HMAC SHA256 hash of the signed_request payload but that doesn't match the signed_request signature.
I think the problem is that Facebook's signature is in a different format. It looks to be binary (~1抚Ö.....) while the HMAC SHA256 hash I'm generating is a hexadecimal string (7f7e8f5f.....). In Facebook's PHP example the hash_hmac function uses the raw binary parameter. So I think I need to either convert Facebook's signature to hexadecimal or my signature to binary in order to do an ""apples-to-apples"" comparison and get a match.
Here's my code:
/* Use the libraries from https://code.google.com/archive/p/crypto-js/

var sig = base64UrlDecode(encodedSig);

var expectedSig;

expectedSig = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(encodedPayload, FB_APP_SECRET); // Unaltered payload string; no match
expectedSig = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(payload, FB_APP_SECRET); // base64-decoded payload string; no match

if (sig == expectedSig) {
    Response.write(payload);

    // Replace characters and convert from base64.
    return Base64.decode(input.replace(""-"", ""+"").replace(""_"", ""/""));

","After looking into the crypto-js documentation about encoding I found the solution. The de-/encoding methods provided by crypto-js are listed under 'Encoders' at the bottom of https://code.google.com/archive/p/crypto-js/ (Thanks for the nudge, CBroe.)
The solution was to use .toString() on the signatures. It seems like crypto-js uses a word format that was preventing a comparison match. I did also switch to using the base64 decoding provided by crypto-js in order to stick with one library.
Here's my updated code:

I learnt how to store HMAC-based token in HTTP cookies.
The idea is that the server has a secret key and is the only entity able to generate valid tokens.
I also read this thread:
How do stateless servers work?
There is an interesting example about Paypal-like website.
If an attacker just copy the content of a token, he can do whatever he want with the account until the token being invalid.
I see several ways to avoid that issue:

Store IP address or its hash in the token: possibly annoying for user?
Store user-agent or its hash in the token: low added value
Ask for re-authentication for security-based use cases (ex: password change)
Add a one-time password layer

Is there additional weaknesses?

I'm currently managing a code base in which we've got a mysql database with all records encrypted using the php-encryption library. This works well for our current setup. We now got a new business requirement that should make it possible to do a SELECT based on one of the encrypted fields.
Since it is impossible to select based on the encrypted values I searched around and found ciphersweet. It's a new (6 months old) repo with currently only 136 github stars. I've read through a blogpost about it written by the company behind the lib. It sounds ok, but since I'm not a cryptographic expert I can't really judge it's secureness.
Is there anybody else out there who can comment on this library/technology? or does anybody know another source where the quality of this technology is evaluated?
","I don't know this lib, but the company authored https://github.com/paragonie/random_compat which is the de facto standard.

"25670638","Node: API authentication of 3rd party apps","I am building an API for a mobile APP. However, I want to also be able to allow other apps to use the API. If someone wants access to my API, they would request an clientKey and clientSecret that would be associated to that company (the one who is using the api). If someone makes a request to my API, given the clientKey I'd know which company is making the request and with the secret I could use HMAC signing to check authenticity. If a request is valid, then I will know which company is making the request and therefore can check if the request is valid for that company (a company would only be able to manage its own resources for example). 
I am using node + mongoose + passport (for regular app users login). 
Questions:
1) Does this seem like a good approach?
2) Are there any security flaws in this scheme?
3) Does anyone know a good stable node module that does this?
4) Any other thoughts are welcome

","The HMAC algorithm is more than just ""hash key followed by message""; the key is padded to match the algorithm's block size, each byte is then xor-ed with a fixed ""ipad"" (0x36), the hash is computed from that value followed by the text is computed. Then the original padded key is xor-ed with a fixed ""opad"" (0x5C) and the hash is again computed from that new value followed by the hash from the previous step.
Point is, it's not as straightforward as you think it is. You can look at the contents of the hmac.HMAC class to see the additional rigmarole Python does to follow the HMAC RFC.

","You are using two different algorithms to create a Message Authentication Code, or MAC.
When you are using the hmac module, you are creating a hashed MAC, or HMAC. Here, the key is used twice (with a different XOR mask each time) to prepend a value to the data, and a hash function (provided by the hashlib library) is used to process the input data a block at a time to 'compress' the data first into in inner value, then an outer value after prepending the second key, in a two-step process. This makes the algorithm very flexible as any block hash can be adapted for this technique.
BLAKE2, with a key, can also be used to create a MAC, but it is the hash function itself that then uses that key to produce a 'secret' hash output, one that can only be verified with the same key, so producing a secure signature too. It does this by making the key the first block for the iterative hashing operation.
But Blake2 without a key, is just another hash function, like SHA256 and others, and when you use it in an HMAC, the different approach will produce a different result. The two are not compatible, because the two algorithms use their key very differently.
Quoting from the RFC 7693 – BLAKE2 Crypto Hash and MAC:

BLAKE2 does not require
     a special ""HMAC"" (Hashed Message Authentication Code) construction
     for keyed message authentication as it has a built-in keying
     mechanism.

and from the BLAKE2 section of the hashlib documentation:

BLAKE2 supports keyed mode (a faster and simpler replacement for HMAC), [...]

The salt argument to the hashlib.blake2b() function is a different feature of the BLAKE2 hashing algorithm, where otherwise you'd just prepend the salt with the hashed plaintext. A salt 'randomises' the output so that it is highly unlikely to produce the same output for the same input message twice (making it impossible for a 3rd party to detect repeated messages).

I changed it to this and it works just fine

"35975437","is this hashing / verification class safe enough?","I know this kind of question has been asked here more than many times, but under every question there is recommendation to ask these things to someone who knows what they are doing. (so we can learn what we are doing as well)
Also I couldn't find enough satisfying examples with updated php functions..
So here is my hashing class which I am developing for an open-source project. I have 4 steps

base64 encode the password, for safer encryption format
merge password with a server-side key using sha256
merge, merged password and pepper, with random key which will be stored in database (called cholesterol, for preventing mix-ups, since as main hash salt I am using password_hash default random salt)
hash the result with password_hash, default blowfish, with 16 cost

The parts I am not sure about are key lengths, should I use another base64 encode in order to prevent raw bytes problem with sha256 and is the resulting hash has right format for direct insert to mysql.
Also how secure the class usage itself.
Here is the class:
<?php
namespace shotwn\lazywork;

/**
* add manual here
* pepper is a static server-side key, generated with hash_hmac sha256 and random keys
*
* cholesterol is a random, 22digit?(need more?) database stored key which has been used as salt with
* hash_hmac sha256
*
* main structure is
* password_hash(hash_hmac(sha256, hash_hmac(sha256, base64_encode(password), pepper),cholesterol))

class PasswordKitchen {
  private static $password_pepper;

  function __construct() {
       try {
         self::$password_pepper = include ""/../.nope/biber.key"";
       } catch (Exception $e) {
         throw new Exception(""No pepper key"");
       }
   }

  private function season(string $password, string $cholesterol = null) {
    //use site-wide password pepper
    $password_safe = base64_encode ($password);
    if(isset($cholesterol) && $cholesterol != null) {
      $password_cholesterol = $cholesterol;
    } else {
      $password_cholesterol = substr(base64_encode(openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(17)),0,22);; //will be user-based mysql recorded
      $password_cholesterol = str_replace(""+"",""."",$password_cholesterol);
    }

    $password_with_pepper = hash_hmac(""sha256"",$password_safe,self::$password_pepper);
    $password_with_pepper_and_cholesterol = hash_hmac(""sha256"",$password_with_pepper,$password_cholesterol);

    $seasonedPassword = (array) [
      ""password_w_PaC"" => $password_with_pepper_and_cholesterol,

    $options = [
        'cost' => $cost, //change for admin accounts
    ];

    $seasoning = $this->season($password);
    $seasoned_password = $seasoning[""password_w_PaC""];
    $password_cholesterol = $seasoning[""password_cholesterol""];

    $passwordHash = password_hash($seasoned_password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);

    return (array) [
      ""hash"" => $passwordHash,
      ""cholesterol"" => $password_cholesterol,
    ];
  }

  public function validate(string $password, string $cholesterol, string $hash) {
    $seasonThePassword = $this->season($password, $cholesterol);
    return password_verify($seasonThePassword[""password_w_PaC""], $hash);
  }
}

","This is what password_hash() already does:

It generates a safe salt
and calculates a BCrypt hash with a cost
factor of currently 10.

So there is no need to take extra steps to safely store your passwords. Especially the generation of the random salt (cholesterol) is already done by the function. The cost factor you pass to your function is never used.
So i would recommend to just use the password_hash() directly:
// Hash a new password for storing in the database.
// The function automatically generates a cryptographically safe salt.
$hashToStoreInDb = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);

// Check if the hash of the entered login password, matches the stored hash.
// The salt and the cost factor will be extracted from $existingHashFromDb.
$isPasswordCorrect = password_verify($password, $existingHashFromDb);

If you want a higher cost factor you can pass it in the options, be aware that increasing the cost factor by one, will double the calculation time, 16 seems to be an unnecessary high factor.
If you want to include a server side secret, there is a better way as to add it as a pepper. Instead encrypt the resulting hash. Further explanations you can find at the end of my tutorial about safely storing passwords.

But when trying to describe this design pattern in a Google search, all I get is ""HMAC"" which appears to be more sophisticated; HMAC is designed to never send the shared secret directly to the server, and involves hashing the secret key with other data.
So what am I looking at? Is there a name for it?
","You are correct, using an API key in the way you describe is not HMAC.  It is often referred to as ""API Key Authentication"" or some similar name.  API key authentication is simply a password that is passed, usually as a header, along with every request.
This is only secure when paired with HTTPS, so that anyone watching the traffic can't simply read out the API key.

(EDIT: is a JWS a valid MAC?)","so I am working on a software that will have to eventually communicate with one or more servers. I am experimenting on implementing Json Web Tokens for specific parts of this communication (basically not for authentification, they will be access tokens mostly).
For some reasons, I would want to include sensitive data as a part of the payload (not highly sensitive, more like infos that are better not be shown for privacy reasons, but not critical for the application integrity).
After reading the JWE specs, and considering the available time i have to do this, i would like to spare the task of building a proper JWE for the moment, and just use a custom function to encrypt the payload before creating the JWS. A proper JWE would be then delayed until next version of the software.
Is it totally to be avoided? Can i use this as a temporary solution? Or is it rather a sign of bad desing of my communication ways?
EDIT - I preferred editing this topic, as the new question is closely related to the first one, but a bit more precise and specific:
I went on with proper security specifications and tests with it. Now that i came up with what seems to be a good encryption solution, and read quite a lot more on the subject, it seems that the approach I started to work with would be valid: it is stated in many places that encryption does not cover the content integrity, so that the message must go through a MAC (after encryption).
_So, let's take the initial question in the inverse order: now that i have a properly encrypted message, and then need to MAC it, is a JWS built with the HMAC algorithm a valid MAC? Or is it just language abuse to call it a HMAC JWS?

I have this small library class:

    public static int HashSizeInBytes = 20;

        hmacInstance.DoFinal(result, 0);

        return result;
    }
}

And I have a lot of messages going through this method, all using the same key: hmacKey, and I would like to speed it up as much as I can, and reuse as much as I can, still with respect to security parameters (randomness, freshness...).
If I try to reuse or parallellize the hmac instance, I get an ""array out of bounds"" exception inside Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Macs.Hmac.BlockUpdate.
I've created this unittest for reproduction (1 or 2 parallel hash functions goes fine, 100 goes wrong):
[Test]
public void TestBulkHashing()
{
    var messages = new List<byte[]>();

    foreach (var index in Enumerable.Range(0, 100))
    {
        var buffer = new byte[4096];
        Random r = new Random();
        r.NextBytes(buffer);

        messages.Add(buffer);
    }

    Parallel.ForEach(messages, m =>
    {
        HashingTools.HashSha1(m);
    });
}

","As correctly surmised by @dlatikay, this is a synchronization mistake. Bouncycastle's classes are not thread-safe unless they explicitly say it is.
If you modify your HashSha1 method to explicitly synchronize threads you will not get the exception:
public static byte[] HashSha1(byte[] message) {
    byte[] result = new byte[hmacInstance.GetMacSize()];
    lock(hmacInstance) {
        hmacInstance.BlockUpdate(message, 0, message.Length);
        hmacInstance.DoFinal(result, 0);
    }

    return result;
}

As to your question about optimization, Bouncycastle already pre-computes the part of the computation that involves the key. When you call DoFinal(...) the internal state is reset to this pre-computed value so you do not need to call Init() again for the next HMac if you use the same key. Your code already takes advantage of this optimization so I don't think there is more you can do unless you want to write your own hashing code.

Background:
I am trying to make the R code work the same as the python code below (I am not very experienced with python).
     raw_key = 'QQrawkeyrawkeyrawkeyrawkey4='
     key = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(raw_key)
     url_test = 'example_url'
     hmac.new(key, url_test.encode(), hashlib.sha1).digest()

Additional context is that I need to string to create the signature for a call to the google distance matrix API using a premium account.
","digest::hmac(.., raw=TRUE) isn't actually returning a character vector, it's returning a ""raw"" vector in R. To convert this to a string, use
rawToChar(signature)

PHP sample:
base64_encode(hash_hmac('sha384', $message, trim($key), true))

signature = Base64.encode64(hmac_hash)

Here is the message variable is JSON.
","OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest in Ruby outputs a hex string, and that's what you base64 encode. In your PHP code, the true parameter to hash_hmac makes it output raw binary data. Without that, it would be hex, which I think would result in the same as the Ruby one.
So you either need to remove the true param in PHP code, in order to encode the hex representation in PHP, or use OpenSSL::HMAC.digest in Ruby, in order to encode the raw binary data in Ruby.
Also you have trim() on the key in PHP but no .strip in Ruby, but I don't think that's the problem.

"56409305","Nodejs different HMAC signature from OpenSSL","I've been struggling with creating a correct HMAC signature in Node.
Use case
I'm currently working a Jointspace API client for Node to control Philips smart tv's. But to get this working I need to sign a string for a pairing request.
Current situation
My nodejs code looks like this:
const crypto = require('crypto');

let secret = Buffer.from('ZmVay1EQVFOaZhwQ4Kv81ypLAZNczV9sG4KkseXWn1NEk6cXmPKO/MCa9sryslvLCFMnNe4Z4CPXzToowvhHvA==', 'base64');
let text = '12345';
let algorithm = 'sha1';
let hmac = crypto.createHmac(algorithm, secret);
hmac.write(text);
hmac.end();

console.log(hmac.read('binary').toString('base64'));

When I run it, it results to this:
~ $ node test.js
DURLMkx7YdrIlWdUKo3iNDC3cp0=

Expected
When I do the exact same thing with the openssl command via the command line, I get a different result. (The correct result)
~ $ echo -n ""ZmVay1EQVFOaZhwQ4Kv81ypLAZNczV9sG4KkseXWn1NEk6cXmPKO/MCa9sryslvLCFMnNe4Z4CPXzToowvhHvA=="" | base64 -d | openssl dgst -sha1 -hmac ""12345"" -binary | base64
GvbRLlBSY8r/jPqUGox8zZHxOew=

References
There is an issue on the node Github page which addresses an issue of a difference between Node and openssl. In that issue they basically say that crypto in node is just a wrapper for the C++ openssl library. And in order for it to properly work you need to provide the secret as a Buffer instead of a string because of conversion issues.
E.g.
crypto.createHmac('sha1', new Buffer('secret_key', 'utf8'));

But this does not resolve my issue.

","Hmac is more secure.
What you are proposing is called ""Suffix-MAC"" in Crypto101 page 135.  The problem with Suffix-MAC is a collision in the hash function can be used to create existential forgeries.  That is, if h(m1) = h(m2), and if I know suffix-mac(m1), then I also know suffix-mac(m2).
Bellare proved that HMAC is more robust because you don't need collision resistance of the hash function for it to be secure.  This is why HMAC-SHA1 is still considered okay even though SHA1 is not considered okay.

","The digest() function in R doesn't do the same thing as the .digest() method in python. It doesn't extract the value, it computes a new digest for whatever you pass in. Also the hmac function will by default return a string with the bytes in it, but you want to base64 encode the actual bytes so you need to make sure to request the raw values. Finally, a base64 string should have a multiple of 4 characters in the string. The extra padding seems to return a different value. So this should give the same value as the python code
api_key = ""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456789=""
decoded_api_key = base64Decode(api_key)
hmac_binary = hmac(decoded_api_key, ""MySpecialString"", ""sha512"", raw=TRUE)
hmac_encoded = base64Encode(hmac_binary)
print(as.character(hmac_encoded))

","You'll want to use the [querystring][1] vmod. As far as I know it does not come pre-packaged, so you will need to build it but it should do exactly what you need. 
With that you can define regexes/static values to match querystring arguments, and then filter those out or in.

"45581884","HMAC API exposed via public site?","What steps can I take to prevent unauthorised access to our API (if indeed any are required)?
Background
The diagram below illustrates a microsite we're implementing, and an HMAC API we're providing (for several purposes) which returns commercially sensitive data to authenticated consumers.  The arrows represent intended (green) and unintended (red) communication.

The HMAC API is intended for address autocompletion.  There is no login for the microsite.  The page has an address input.  To enable autocomplete the page makes an AJAX GET call to the controller after each keystroke.  For each AJAX GET call, the controller constructs the HMAC and makes a request to the HMAC API.
The problem
I can't see anything currently preventing consumption of the AJAX GET method.
Considerations
I've read that AnitForgeryTokens aren't useful on GET methods, but that you can get around this by turning it into a POST.  That sounds a bit ugly, but since this is only a microsite (i.e. we're throwing it away after a month or so) I'm quite prepared to put up with ugly security.
Seven years on from that, is that still the best way?
","
prevent unauthorised access to a method on an unauthenticated controller

If you don't have any authentication and authorization (""unauthenticated controller"") then there can be no such thing as an unauthorized access: i.e. every access is allowed. And, what does not exist cannot be prevented.
If you could defined what unauthorized access means in your use case you might be able to add some authorization which prevents it.

const someOtherPlaintextPassword = 'not_bacon';

Another one is bcrypt-nodejs and you might do something like this:

bcrypt.compareSync(""bacon"", hash); // true
bcrypt.compareSync(""veggies"", hash); // false

","I resolved this by putting the timestamp (seconds since epoch) in the body of the post request, or parameter of the get request. I simply used the timestamp as the signature for encoding, which means the HMAC hash is different for every request that comes in a different second.
Then to prevent an attacker just using a previously seen timestamp I verified on the server that the timestamp is not more than 5 seconds before the current.
An attacker with a really fast turn around of intercepting a communication and sending an attack could still get through, but I couldn't drop the timeout below 5 seconds because it's already getting some requests timing out.
Since the whole thing is done under SSL I think it should be secure enough.

Our Ubuntu 18.04 build server (running Jenkins) sits behind a firewall with only specific IP ranges white-listed.
We have an HAProxy (1.8) instance receiving all inbound requests and routing to the appropriate backend service.
The problem is SonarCloud have changed their webhooks from a defined set of IP addresses to using HMAC to validate authenticity. This means the webhooks are blocked by the firewall unless we open it to all internet traffic.

If we can congifure HAProxy to validate the HMAC then we can open the server to all traffic & use HAProxy to validate these requests (as well as other existing IP whitelisted ranges).
","HAProxy doesn't do HMAC natively, but it can be done using  HAProxy's Lua integration.
One approach would be to find a Lua library that can do the flavor of HMAC that you need, and then write an HAProxy converter in Lua to take the appropriate inputs and do the calculation of the digest for comparison.
I implemented something similar, once, using HAProxy 1.6 with Lua 5.x where the client sent a URL signed using HMAC-SHA1, and the proxy successfully checked it for validity.
Unfortunately, I no longer have access to that code, but I wrote this HAProxy converter to do utf-8-aware URL-escaping (percent encoding) in Lua... I mention it here because it's a complete, working example of one way to extend HAProxy functionality using Lua, including the Lua code and HAProxy configuration needed to use it, so it might help you work toward a solution.

","You’re trying to perform an action after the function’s return statement.  That code will never be reached because the function has returned.
Instead, do it before:
document.getElementById(""demo"").innerHTML = self.GetAuthHeader();
return self;

Or, even better, if this code is provided by a vendor then you probably shouldn’t edit it.  Updates would remove your edits, and vendor support would be compromised.  Instead, perform your action outside the code entirely:
var BuckarooHmac = (function () {
    // vendor code
}());

document.getElementById(""demo"").innerHTML = BuckarooHmac.GetAuthHeader();

Does that mean that i is a signed value and if so what happens on overflow?
","Nothing says that it would be signed.  The fact that dkLen is capped at (2^32 - 1) * hLen suggests that it's an unsigned integer, and that it cannot roll over from 0xFFFFFFFF (2^32 - 1) to 0x00000000.
Of course, PBKDF2(MD5) wouldn't hit 2^31 until you've asked for 34,359,738,368 bytes.  That's an awful lot of bytes.

SHA-1: 42,949,672,960
SHA-2-256 / SHA-3-256: 68,719,476,736
SHA-2-384 / SHA-3-384: 103,079,215,104
SHA-2-512 / SHA-3-512: 137,438,953,472

Since the .NET implementation (in Rfc2898DeriveBytes) is an iterative stream it could be polled for 32GB via a (long) series of calls.  Most platforms expose PBKDF2 as a one-shot, so you'd need to give them a memory range of 32GB (or more) to identify if they had an error that far out.  So even if most platforms get the sign bit wrong... it doesn't really matter.
PBKDF2 is a KDF (key derivation function), so used for deriving keys.  AES-256 is 32 bytes, or 48 if you use the same PBKDF2 to generate an IV (which you really shouldn't).  Generating a private key for the ECC curve with a 34,093 digit prime is (if I did my math right) 14,157 bytes.  Well below the 32GB mark.

","i ranges from 1 to l = CEIL (dkLen / hLen), and dkLen and hLen are positive integers. Therefore, i is strictly positive.
You can, however, store i in a signed, 32-bit integer type without any special handling. If i rolls over (increments from 0x7FFFFFFF to 0xF0000000), it will continue to be encoded correctly, and continue to increment correctly. With two's complement encoding, bitwise results for addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same as long as all values are treated as either signed or unsigned.

"58501315","How to verify a HS256 signed JWT Token created with Keycloak authentication provider on jwt.io","I am trying to verify a HS256 JWT Token generated with locally ran KeyCloak Authentication Provider on https://jwt.io. 
The KeyCloack instance is running on my local machine inside a docker container. I have applied almost the same steps as described in this answer (which on contrary applies the RS algorithm instead, and works as described): https://stackoverflow.com/a/55002225/1534753
My validation procedure is very simple:
1.) Request the token (with Postman) from my local docker KeyCloak instance with:
 POST requesting http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/dev/protocol/openid-connect/token
2.) Copy the token contents inside the jwt.io's ""Encoded"" section
3.) I verify that the header and payload are as expected and correct
4.) I copy the client secret from my KeyCloak instance admin dashboard, you can see the reference on the image below:

5.) I paste the secret into the ""VERIFY SIGNATURE"" section on jwt.io and the ""Encoded"" token section changes, hence resulting with an invalid signature and a invalid (i.e. different) token.
My core question is what am I missing here? Why does the token change when I apply the expected secret!? Am I applying the right secret, the one from the client? If I understand JWT infrastructre and standard correctly then It should stay the same if the secret (with the expected algorithm applied) is valid. My reasoning is that something with JWT creation on KeyCloak is specific. I have not touched the HS256 algorithm provider on KeyCloak, everything is used as default with the docker installation guide on using KeyCloak. The settings related to the token and algorithm are setup to use HS256, and the algorithm is specified as expected in the JWT's header section correctly which can be verified after the encoded token is pasted into the jwt.io's page.
I need this to work as I am trying to apply the same JWT validation process inside a .NET Core web API application. I have encountered this whole issue in there, i.e. inside the System.IdentityModel.Tokens.JWT and the JwtSecurityTokenHandle.ValidateSignature method which results with an invalid signature and finally resulting in an exception. 
On side note, I am accessing the token with Postman and its Authorize feature the configuration can be seen on the image below:

One more side note is I have a user ""John"" which belongs to my ""Demo"" realm. I use him to request an access token from KeyCloak.

Update in response to your comment
The first thing to notice is that in R sha256 with a non-NULL key argument will calculate the hash-based message authentication code (HMAC). From ?sha256:

All hash functions either calculate a hash-digest for ‘key ==
       NULL’ or HMAC (hashed message authentication code) when ‘key’ is
       not ‘NULL’.

So if you want to use a key you will need to compare the resulting HMAC in R with the SHA2556-based HMAC in Python.
In R:
library(openssl)
sha256(""test@gmail.com"", key = ""111"")
#[1] ""172f052058445afd9fe3afce05bfec573b5bb4c659bfd4cfc69a59d1597a0031""

","Just to highlight, the standard/native Azure Web Apps run in a secure environment called a sandbox. Each app runs inside its own sandbox, isolating its execution from other instances on the same machine as well as providing an additional degree of security and privacy which would otherwise not be available. 
The only way an application can be accessed via the internet is through the already-exposed HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) TCP ports; applications may not listen on other ports for packets arriving from the internet.
However, applications may create a socket which can listen for connections from within the sandbox. For example, two processes within the same app may communicate with one another via TCP sockets; connection attempts incoming from outside the sandbox, albeit they be on the same machine, will fail.
Using a custom Windows container in App Service lets you make OS changes that your app needs, so it's easy to migrate on-premises app that requires custom OS and software configuration. See sandbox page.
Based on your requirement, you may checkout these document to start-off:
Run a custom Linux container in Azure App Service & Run a custom Windows container in Azure (Preview)
502 bad gateway errors won't be visible in the IIS logs as they’re returned by the frontend servers,  which forwards the requests to the worker hosting the app and there are many reasons why the frontend can return this error, but typically, 502 errors are caused by the application level issues, among them:
•   requests taking a long time
•   application using high memory/CPU
•   application crashing due to an exception
You may always follow the document Troubleshoot HTTP errors of ""502 bad gateway"" and ""503 service unavailable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/troubleshoot-http-502-http-503)"" in Azure App Service for identifying the issue.

Maybe this is not the most elegant of ways to do things. But a solution None the less.
char* hexStringToCharString(unsigned char hash[], int length);
void main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    //the original hash
    unsigned char newHash[] = {0xE4, 0x5F, 0x60, 0x72, 0x61, 0x7C, 0xCE, 0x5E, 0x06, 0xA9, 0x5B, 0xE4, 0x81, 0xC4, 0x33, 0x51, 
        0x02, 0x3D, 0x99, 0x23, 0x35, 0x99, 0xEA, 0xC9, 0xFD, 0xAF, 0xFC, 0x95, 0x81, 0x42, 0x62, 0x9A};
    //what I think is recieved from the socket
    unsigned char* receivedTag = ""e45f6072617cce5e06a95be481c43351023d99233599eac9fdaffc958142629a"";

    char *newString = hexStringToCharString(newHash, 32);

    for (int i=0; i!=strlen(newString); i++)
    {
            if (receivedTag[i]!=newString[i])
            {
                    printf(""DATA MISMATCH: Found %02X instead of %02X at index %d!\n"", newHash[i], receivedTag[i], i);
                    break;
            }
    }
    free(newString);

    printf(""Yay\n"");
    return;
}

char* hexStringToCharString(unsigned char hash[], int length){

    char temp[3];
    //need length*2 characters which is 64 plus one for null!
    char *theString = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char)*((length*2)+1));
    strcpy(theString, """");
    for(int i=0;i<length;i++){
        sprintf(temp, ""%02x"", hash[i]);
        strcat(theString, temp);
    }
    return theString;

}

The output in this case
Yay

So, Maybe this is entirely wrong. But if you find this solution needs editing then comment below.

BigQuery includes a number of crypto related functions, such as hash functions and encryption functions, but a HMAC function (that calculates a signature) is missing.
","The BigQuery developers apparently forgot to add HMAC functions, but fortunately that can be built on what is available. HMAC is defined as
HMAC(Key, Message) = H((Key xor opad) concat H((Key xor ipad) concat Message))

where H is a hash function and
Key, ipad and opad are all byte strings of the same length as the blocksize of the hash function.
BigQuery provides all the necessary building blocks to implement this in custom functions. The following code implements HMAC_SHA1, but you can change it to use a different hash function by replacing the hash function and updating the block size.
-- HMAC(K, M) = H((K xor opad) concat H((K xor ipad) concat M))
-- K, opad and ipad are all the same size as the hash function's block size
-- ipad = 0x36 repeated to fill the block size
-- opad = 0x5c repeated to fill the block size
-- If K is smaller than the block size, it must be padded with 0x00s

-- This implementation gives the same result as the online HMAC generator at https://www.freeformatter.com/hmac-generator.html


create temp function blocksize() as (64); -- the block size of the hash function, 64 in the case of SHA1
create temp function ipad() as (repeat(b""\x36"", blocksize()));
create temp function opad() as (repeat(b""\x5c"", blocksize()));

create temp function pad(key BYTES) as (
  concat(key, repeat(b""\x00"", blocksize() - byte_length(key)))
);

create temp function hash_if_needed(key BYTES) as (
  if(byte_length(key) > blocksize(), sha1(key), key)
);

-- size of key == block size
create temp function hmac_sha1_core(key BYTES, message BYTES) as (
  sha1(concat(
    key ^ opad(),
    sha1(concat(key ^ ipad(), message))
  ))
);

-- key must not be larger than the block size
create temp function hmac_sha1_bytes(key BYTES, message BYTES) as (
  hmac_sha1_core(pad(key), message)
);

create temp function hmac_sha1(key STRING, message STRING) as (
  hmac_sha1_bytes(hash_if_needed(cast(key as BYTES)), cast(message as BYTES))
);

To verify, try select to_hex(hmac_sha1(""my secret key"", ""hello world"")) and compare it to the hmac generated on https://www.freeformatter.com/hmac-generator.html

Basically, I want the client to send my server a username and password, and I want the server to respond by giving the client a token that can be used in lieu of a password from that point forward.
I've looked into this a little and a recommendation I keep seeing is to use an HMAC with a secret key known only to the server.  I see the benefit of this method, but it still seems to me that this isn't ideal, since as far as I am able to tell it cannot be expired.  
I can add extra security by adding the ip address to the string used for creating/verifying the hmac, I believe, but I'm still not sure if this is the best way.
Is there any reason not to just have my authentication token simply be generated with something like openssl_random_pseudo_bytes() and stored in my database along with an ip address and username?  Then I can just send the user that and verify it against what's in the database.  It also allows me to easily expire or log out the user.
","If you have a secret key known only to the server it can be expired any time you want?  Just change the secret key (keeping a history for expiration tracking purposes) and all the old tokens should be invalidated.
If that is the rotue you go, I suggest using a different secret for each user, this allows you to revoke specific user tokens at will.

1) We use JwT bearer token authentication (integrated with Identityserver 3) and we have implemented custom authorization using the database. All this over Https.
2) Next, we also have an IP address check, where we check the IP address of the incoming request and match it against a list of whitelisted IP addresses that we maintain.
Now, we are trying to get rid of the IP address way of doing the second level check and replace it with another way.
MY question is: Is HMAC a good candidate for that second level check? I am kind of hesitating as we already have the  token authentication in place and so, was not sure if HMAC way of second level check will add any value to this, as a second level check. Also, was not sure how we can send both a token as well as a HMAC string as part of an Authentication header. 
Can you also please let me know what are some of the good substitutes for IP address validation,  as a second level check when we build a RESTful web api.

","No SHA-256 hash can have only 8 byte positions. The output, as the name suggests, should be 256 bits or 32 bytes. What I suspect to happen is that the input of stringify is already presumed to be bytes, while CryptoJS functions return a WordArray of 32 bit words. As 8 * 32 = 256 this seems reasonable.
So I presume you can simply fix this by using a function on the WordArray instead, for instance hash.toString('hex').

Even the AWS Code provided by them for both javascript and python derived the same values and calculates the same hash as I received. 
However, according to the documentation in their doc's, it should be:

I have tried over 10+ calculators that all return the same value I received until I found 1 online calculator, only 1, that calculates the same as amazon at https://cryptii.com/hmac
I know HMAC is a mathematical function that is absolute, the same input will give the same output, which means that the input is different or that it is transformed along the way in a way that is abstracted from me.
Any tips?

If I've done everything right (other than selecting good keys) so far, I would ordinarily have a 24-byte (i.e., 192-bit) digest, but if I digitally sign the digest prior to appending it, my experience is that the signature block isn't a predictable length.  I'm sure I could come up with any number of ways to identify the end of the message portion, but I don't want to make this a hack.  What is the accepted way of doing this?  (The signature will use ECDSA.)
I should also mention that this will be a multicast message using UDP inside ESP, since that puts constraints on message economy.  (That's also the main reason for the problem--keeping it binary.  The other is the practice of appending, rather than prefixing it with a byte count in front of it.)

I am pretty sure that I am not doing anything wrong when it comes to the padding as well as the creation of the opad and ipad tables. Perhaps my string to int conversions are off. Perhaps its a weird quirk with Lua 5.3 that I don't know about. I don't know what I am missing here. It could be very obvious, but I am not seeing it at the moment. Thanks in advance for your assistance.
I should add that this implementation is needed for a lua sandbox in which I cannot use other libraries.

But, using python 3, the computed signature doesn't match the signature in the header in any way at all. Xero would send numerous requests to the subscribing webhook url for both correctly and incorrect. In my log, all those requests returned as 401. So, below is my test code which also proved to not match. I don't know what is missing or I what did wrong.
Don't worry about the key been show here, i have generated another key but this was the key assigned to me to use for hashing at this point.

I am not versed in python 2, but it looks like binascii.hexlify would be a way to accomplish the conversion.  Just remember this conversion is only for the benefit of your eyeballs.  The actual code uses the binary representations of the intermediate keys.

"58191951","Use HMAC with OData Connected Service","So we want to use a webapi that is build in ASP.net and uses OData as protocol. I did some homework and saw that Microsoft has a very good documenten OData Connected Service. The only thing I can't find is that the webapi we want to use has a HMAC for security. I cannot find an example where the OData Connected Service is used with HMAC. Could someone explain if and how HMAC is possible with the OData Connected Service?
","Probably the answer depends on the specific implementation of the HMAC on the server side.
If server receives all the data included in the request along with the Authorization header and extracts the values (APP Id, Signature, Nonce and Request Time stamp) from the Authorization header, then client should:

Build a string by combining all the data that will be sent, this string contains the following parameters (APP Id, HTTP method, request URI, request time stamp, nonce, and Base 64 string representation of the request pay load). 
The signature will be sent in the Authorization header using a custom scheme such as ”amx”. The data in the Authorization header will contain the APP Id, request time stamp, and nonce separated by colon ‘:’. The format for the Authorization header will be like: [Authorization: amx APPId:Signature:Nonce:Timestamp].
Client send the request as usual along with the generated data in the Authorization header (just use client hooks or httpclient).

Example (after generating client code):
private string APPId = ""65d3a4f0-0239-404c-8394-21b94ff50604"";
private string APIKey = ""WLUEWeL3so2hdHhHM5ZYnvzsOUBzSGH4+T3EgrQ91KI="";

My question is what is the most secure way to store the private key for the client? localStorage seems to be unsafe, and the Secure HTTPS-Only Cookies would work, but the JS has to have access to it to generate the HMAC for each request? What would be the best workaround in this situation?

","HMAC outputs a hash (byte array) from input of another byte array. So - effectively you need to make a byte array (or multiple arrays) from your structure. 
The important thing is - your structure should be unique for unique data. What I mean is - having two fields with values ""abc"" ""def"" or ""abcd"" ""ef"". If you just concatenate the values, you will get ""abcdef"" in both cases and it could be possible to authenticate wrong message. A solution could be putting some constant values as field separators.

Obviously client's machine can have any datetime set and for this to be correctly checked on the server, it has to match server's date & time. What is the best practice for this?
I can currently think of a few ways that would work:

Before every request, send an API request to retrieve current server's date & time (not prefered method as that would essentially double the number of ajax requests).
On page load, send an API request to retrieve current server's date & time, and save the client's date and time as well. For any further ajax requests, compare the current time to client's time and add the same difference to the saved initial server time to essentially get the server time.
Same as #2, but instead of initial API request, embed the datetime in the HTML page itself.

Is there any better way that I am not thinking of? Any #2 & #3 caveats (with timezones, DST etc.) that I am missing?
Thanks!

The php uses the line substr(hash_hmac('sha256', $string, $token), 0, 20) which outputs

In Objective-C I use CCHmac like this:
NSData *hmacForKeyAndData(NSString *token, NSString *string)

I think you can see my problem here. I have the right output (It just needs trimming to 20 characters), but as NSData. If I convert the NSData to an NSString then I get a load of funny characters. I need to take the NSData <ac560934> and convert it into the string ac560934
Is this even possible? Or should I be using a different approach for the hash_mac?

Data is stored in JSON format. Before writing to the file, we create JSON string and calculate HMAC. Then both of the information are written to a file. When file is read, we again generate the HMAC of the data and compare it to the stored hash.
It sounds like something trivial and something that should not cause any issues, however we are getting a lot of reports that this check fails. We get them also from our testers, who definitely didn't tamper the file.
I'm wondering if it's possible that reading/writing file could affect the process. Due to some legacy code, the file is read and written in binary mode. I'm wondering if this could affect the process? I'm not going to ""let's change it and see what happens"" before I have a confirmation that this could be the case.
The file is read and stored on the same system all the time, it's not transferred anywhere.

# Convert hex-encoded data into a byte array
hash_bytes = bytes.fromhex(hash)

# Split bytes into 4-byte chunks (32-bit integers) and convert
# The integers in your example a big-endian, signed integers
hash_ints = [
    int.from_bytes(hash_bytes[i:i+4], ""big"", signed=True) 
    for i in range(0, len(hash_bytes), 4)

# Print result
print({""words"": hash_ints, ""sigBytes"": len(hash_bytes)})

I would take a look at calling sign.digest() to see if it returns the string you are expecting.  If it is, then you can replace headers={'apisign': sign} with headers={'apisign': sign.digest()}.

","Your code is wrong. data must be an array of uint8, but you declared it as an array of pointers to uint8.
Furthermore the last parameter of HMAC must be a pointer to unsigned int but you provided an unsigned int, that's the reason for the crash.
Your compiler should have warned you. Compile with -Wall.
Corrected (untested) code:
int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  uint8_t data[] = { 0x14, 0xf7, 0xbd, 0x95, 0x57, 0x9a, 0x7e, 0xa1, 0x5c, 0xf7, 0x27, 0x91, 0x0d, 0x61, 0x58, 0x01, 0xa3, 0x12, 0x17, 0x54, 0x0b, 0x2e, 0xb4, 0xc5, 0xb1, 0xeb, 0xab, 0xe0, 0x43, 0x9b, 0x8e, 0x1f, 0x39, 0x7d, 0x85, 0x1a, 0x3a, 0x4b, 0x9c, 0xf4, 0xbf, 0x31, 0x55, 0x72, 0x41, 0xf5, 0xdb, 0xcb, 0xb3, 0xa6, 0xb5, 0xb8, 0x82, 0xe5, 0xef, 0x18, 0x72, 0xa0, 0x59, 0x08, 0x9b, 0xfa, 0x17, 0xa3 };

Log-In
Click on my avatar 
Click Go To Admin
Scrolled down to the section INTEGRATIONS in the left side of the menu
Clicked Connect
Clicked Add Configuration

I named the configuration
Added the URL to my endpoint
In the Integration and Security Settings I selected Include HMAC Signature - Recommended - Use a hash to verify message authenticity.

Clicked the Save button

To receive Webhook messages from DocuSing I'm following this method. But I still don't get the signature in the header. 
Since the documentation is outdate I might have missed some crucial setting that is needed to enable the signing off of the Webhook. 
I hope someone cane point to my mistake. 
","You are using two different things and mixing them.
The first thing you did was a global connect configuration for the entire account.
The second is for a specific envelope, and it overrides the global connect configuration.
You actually don't need to do that part. Once you have a global connect configuration - all envelopes in this account would be impacted and if you added HMAC - it would be applied to that.
Try to remove this code and just send the envelope regularly and see if you get the HMAC header.

","your key value must be a byte array of bytes.
to convert a string object to a bytes using following code 
key=bytes(str('7car2d2b-7527-14e1-8975-06cf1059afe0'),'utf8')

and then give the key to hamc.new object
Or 
you can use bytearray function instead of bytes

By manually setting up the headers we've been able to make it work with some calls. We both feel uncomfortable with this solution anyway--we really do not want to be reinventing the wheel on something as important as our HMAC auth.
We are currently trying to figure out if there's a way in ActiveResource to setup the default connection being used. If this is feasible we can easily setup a Faraday connection using HMAC, and then rest easily knowing that ActiveResource will always use that connection. 
We did try the api_auth gem but encountered errors (which I've lost track of). We are going to try it again, but I'm not brimming with hope.

My problem is that when I try to connect to my webservice and call my controller, I always get an error message about ms-signature parameter. The only way to call my controller is to use HMAC authentication in the client side (ie SHA calculations on a secret key and the JSON data to be send to the webservice). It seems thata HMAC authentication is set by default, even if I don't want it.
I added a BasicAuthenticationFilter class for login and password check, and it works, but I still have the error message about ms-signature parameter before I can call my controller.
What should I do to disable HMAC authentication in my REST webservice? Basic Authentication by login and password is enough security for me.
","Apparently, the answer was that if I do not want SHA authentication, I need to use Nu-Get to install AspNet.Webhooks.Receiver.Generic package rather than AspNet.WebHooks.Receiver.Custom package. Some changes must be applied to the code, but I finally get ride of SHA authetification which seems to be set by default in Custom WebHooks receivers.

"58081482","Swift HMAC doesn't match NodeJS HMAC, but only sometimes!","I have discovered a HUGE issue in my code, and I have literally no idea what is causing this. 
SO, when I send requests to my server I hash a string thats in the request. This is sometimes user input.
My app is multi language so I have to support all ""ä"" chars etc.
So with the normal english letters/chars numbers etc, this hashing method works like a dream. BUT when the string being hashed and compared contains a ""ä"" or a ""ö"" (Not specifically those, it literally might be that any char not in the Base64 set will cause this) the hash doesn't match!
This is an absolute and complete disaster, and I have not noticed it this far. I have tried basically everything I know to try to fix this, and googling, and I am out of luck so far.
I generate the hash in Swift inputting the string and secretToken into this function and saving the output as a HTTP header: 
func hmac(string: String, key: String) -> String {

    var digest = [UInt8](repeating: 0, count: Int(CC_SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH))

    CCHmac(CCHmacAlgorithm(kCCHmacAlgSHA256), key, key.count, string, string.count, &digest)

    let data = Data(digest)

    return data.map { String(format: ""%02hhx"", $0) }.joined()

}

How I compare the hash in NodeJS:
if (hashInTheRequest === crypto.createHmac('sha256', secretToken).update(stringToHash).digest('hex')) {
    //Good to go
}

Thanks in advance!
","This could be due to a composition issue. You mentioned non-latin characters, but didn't specify any concrete examples, where you had problems.
What is composition?
Unicode aims to be able to represent any character used by humanity. However, many characters are similar, such as u, ü, û and ū. The original idea was to just assign a code point to every possible combination. As one might imagine, this is not the most effective way to store things. Instead, the ""base"" character is used, and then a combining character is added to it.
Let's look at an example: ü
ü can be represented as U+00FC, also known as LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH DIAERESIS.
ü can also be represented as U+0075 (u), followed by U+0308 (◌̈), also known as LATIN SMALL LETTER U, followed by COMBINING DIARESIS.
Why is this problematic?
Because hash functions don't know what a string is. All they care about is bytes. As such, a string has to be decoded to a string of bytes. As was shown above, there are multiple different ways to decode a string, which means that two different systems can decode the same logical string to different bytes, thus resulting in different hashes.
How can I fix this?
You have to explicitly define how the string will be decoded on both platforms, to ensure that both decode the strings in the exact same manner.

"58703583","Replicating Python HMAC Encoding to R","I am trying to create a token for an API call in R. I have example code and output in Python, but I am unable to replicate in R. I know little to nothing about encoding, decoding, etc. Hoping someone can shed some light on what I can do to make these outputs match. Here is an example.
    import base64
    import hmac
    import hashlib

    secret_key = 'AAAAAABBB'
    uri = '/keywords'
    method = 'GET'
    timestamp = time.time() * 1000
    message = ""{}.{}.{}"".format(timestamp, method, uri)

    hash = hmac.new(bytes(secret_key, ""utf-8""), bytes(message, ""utf-8""), hashlib.sha256)
    hash.hexdigest()
    signature = base64.b64encode(hash.digest())

Can anyone please help me with replicating above codes into R?
Thank you.

"58747568","Authentication being bypassed when called from a browser","I have implemented hmac authentication in a .NET Core 2.1 website. On my local machine when hmac is turned on when I hit the URL in the browser I get a 401 error. In my testing app if I send no authentication I get a 401 error. If I send the authentication it all works great.
On the server if I hit the website in the browser it works i.e. I don't get a 401, I should. If I call it from my test client I get a 401 unless I send the authentication. 
I can't work our why on the server deployment. What could allow a browser not to need authentication but forces a test client to?
