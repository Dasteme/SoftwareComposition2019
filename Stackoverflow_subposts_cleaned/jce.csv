"6340918","Trust Store vs Key Store - creating with keytool","I understand that the keystore would usually hold private/public keys and the trust store only public keys (and represents the list of trusted parties you intend to communicate with). Well, that's my first assumption, so if that's not correct, I probably haven't started very well...
I was interested though in understanding how / when you distinguish the stores when using keytool.
So, far I've created a keystore using
keytool -import -alias bob -file bob.crt -keystore keystore.ks

which creates my keystore.ks file. I answer yes to the question do I trust bob but it is unclear to me if this has created a keystore file or a truststore file? I can set up my application to use the file as either.

","There is no difference between keystore and truststore files. Both are files in the proprietary JKS file format. The distinction is in the use: To the best of my knowledge, Java will only use the store that is referenced by the -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore system property to look for certificates to trust when creating SSL connections. Same for keys and -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore. But in theory it's fine to use one and the same file for trust- and keystores.

","The terminology is a bit confusing indeed, but both javax.net.ssl.keyStore and javax.net.ssl.trustStore are used to specify which keystores to use, for two different purposes. Keystores come in various formats and are not even necessarily files (see this question), and keytool is just a tool to perform various operations on them (import/export/list/...).
The javax.net.ssl.keyStore and javax.net.ssl.trustStore parameters are the default parameters used to build KeyManagers and TrustManagers (respectively), then used to build an SSLContext which essentially contains the SSL/TLS settings to use when making an SSL/TLS connection via an SSLSocketFactory or an SSLEngine. These system properties are just where the default values come from, which is then used by SSLContext.getDefault(), itself used by SSLSocketFactory.getDefault() for example. (All of this can be customized via the API in a number of places, if you don't want to use the default values and that specific SSLContexts for a given purpose.)
The difference between the KeyManager and TrustManager (and thus between javax.net.ssl.keyStore and javax.net.ssl.trustStore) is as follows (quoted from the JSSE ref guide):

TrustManager:     Determines whether the
  remote authentication credentials (and
  thus the connection) should be
  trusted.
KeyManager:   Determines which
  authentication credentials to send to
  the remote host.

(Other parameters are available and their default values are described in the JSSE ref guide. Note that while there is a default value for the trust store, there isn't one for the key store.)
Essentially, the keystore in javax.net.ssl.keyStore is meant to contain your private keys and certificates, whereas the javax.net.ssl.trustStore is meant to contain the CA certificates you're willing to trust when a remote party presents its certificate. In some cases, they can be one and the same store, although it's often better practice to use distinct stores (especially when they're file-based).

","Keystore is used by a server to store private keys, and Truststore is used by third party client to store public keys provided by server to access. I have done that in my production application. Below are the steps for generating java certificates for SSL communication:

Generate a certificate using keygen command in windows:

keytool -genkey -keystore server.keystore -alias mycert -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 3950

Self certify the certificate:

keytool -selfcert -alias mycert -keystore server.keystore -validity 3950

Export certificate to folder:

keytool -export -alias mycert -keystore server.keystore -rfc -file mycert.cer

Import Certificate into client Truststore:

","To explain in common usecase/purpose or layman way: 

TrustStore : As the name indicates, its normally used to store the certificates
  of trusted entities. A process can maintain a store of certificates of all its trusted parties
  which  it trusts.
keyStore : Used to store the server keys (both public and private)
  along with signed cert.

During the SSL handshake, 

A client tries to access https:// 
And thus, Server responds by providing a SSL certificate (which is stored in its keyStore)
Now, the client receives the SSL certificate and verifies it via trustStore (i.e the client's trustStore already has pre-defined set of certificates which it trusts.). Its like : Can I trust this server ? Is this the same server whom I am trying to talk to ? No middle man attacks ?
Once, the client verifies that it is talking to server which it trusts, then SSL communication can happen over a shared secret key. 

Note : I am not talking here anything about client authentication on server side. If a server wants to do a client authentication too, then the server also maintains a trustStore to verify client.

","In simplest terms :
Keystore is used to store your credential (server or client) while truststore is used to store others credential (Certificates from CA).
Keystore is needed when you are setting up server side on SSL, it is used to store server's identity certificate, which server will present to a client on the connection while trust store setup on client side must contain to make the connection work. If you browser to connect to any website over SSL it verifies certificate presented by server against its truststore.

","These are the steps to create a Truststore in your local machine using Keytool.
Steps to create truststore for a URL in your local machine.
1) Hit the url in the browser using chrome
2) Check for the ""i"" icon to the left of the url in the chrome and click it
3) Check for certificate option and click it and a Dialog box will open
4) check the ""certificate path"" tab for the number of certificates available to create the truststore
5) Go the ""details"" tab -> click""Copy to File"" -> Give the path and the name for the certificate you want to create.
6) Check if it has parent certificates and follow the point ""5"".
7) After all the certificates are being create open Command Prompt and navigate to the path where you created the certificates.
8) provide the below Keytool command to add the certificates and create a truststore.
Sample: 
   keytool -import -alias abcdefg -file abcdefg.cer -keystore cacerts
        where ""abcdefg"" is the alias name and ""abcdefg.cer"" is the actual certificate name and ""cacerts"" is the truststore name

9) Provide the keytool command for all the certificates and add them to the trust store.
    keytool -list -v -keystore cacerts

","There are a couple of commonly quoted solutions to this problem. Unfortunately neither of these are entirely satisfactory:

Install the unlimited strength policy files. While this is probably the right solution for your development workstation, it quickly becomes a major hassle (if not a roadblock) to have non-technical users install the files on every computer. There is no way to distribute the files with your program; they must be installed in the JRE directory (which may even be read-only due to permissions).
Skip the JCE API and use another cryptography library such as Bouncy Castle. This approach requires an extra 1MB library, which may be a significant burden depending on the application. It also feels silly to duplicate functionality included in the standard libraries. Obviously, the API is also completely different from the usual JCE interface. (BC does implement a JCE provider, but that doesn't help because the key strength restrictions are applied before handing over to the implementation.) This solution also won't let you use 256-bit TLS (SSL) cipher suites, because the standard TLS libraries call the JCE internally to determine any restrictions.

But then there's reflection. Is there anything you can't do using reflection?
private static void removeCryptographyRestrictions() {
    if (!isRestrictedCryptography()) {
        logger.fine(""Cryptography restrictions removal not needed"");

Simply call removeCryptographyRestrictions() from a static initializer or such before performing any cryptographic operations.
The JceSecurity.isRestricted = false part is all that is needed to use 256-bit ciphers directly; however, without the two other operations, Cipher.getMaxAllowedKeyLength() will still keep reporting 128, and 256-bit TLS cipher suites won't work.
This code works on Oracle Java 7 and 8, and automatically skips the process on Java 9 and OpenJDK where it's not needed. Being an ugly hack after all, it likely doesn't work on other vendors' VMs.
It also doesn't work on Oracle Java 6, because the private JCE classes are obfuscated there. The obfuscation does not change from version to version though, so it is still technically possible to support Java 6.

","I would use your suggested code, but with a slight simplification:

SecretKey secretKey = keyGen.generateKey();

Let the provider select how it plans to obtain randomness - don't define something that may not be as good as what the provider has already selected.
This code example assumes (as Maarten points out below) that you've configured your java.security file to include your preferred provider at the top of the list. If you want to manually specify the provider, just call KeyGenerator.getInstance(""AES"", ""providerName"");.
For a truly secure key, you need to be using a hardware security module (HSM) to generate and protect the key. HSM manufacturers will typically supply a JCE provider that will do all the key generation for you, using the code above.

","Using KeyGenerator would be the preferred method. As Duncan indicated, I would certainly give the key size during initialization. KeyFactory is a method that should be used for pre-existing keys.
OK, so lets get to the nitty-gritty of this. In principle AES keys can have any value. There are no ""weak keys"" as in (3)DES. Nor are there any bits that have a specific meaning as in (3)DES parity bits. So generating a key can be as simple as generating a byte array with random values, and creating a SecretKeySpec around it.
But there are still advantages to the method you are using: the KeyGenerator is specifically created to generate keys. This means that the code may be optimized for this generation. This could have efficiency and security benefits. It might be programmed to avoid a timing side channel attacks that would expose the key, for instance. Note that it may already be a good idea to clear any byte[] that hold key information as they may be leaked into a swap file (this may be the case anyway though).
Furthermore, as said, not all algorithms are using fully random keys. So using KeyGenerator would make it easier to switch to other algorithms. More modern ciphers will only accept fully random keys though; this is seen as a major benefit over e.g. DES.
Finally, and in my case the most important reason, it that the KeyGenerator method is the only valid way of handling AES keys within a secure token (smart card, TPM, USB token or HSM). If you create the byte[] with the SecretKeySpec then the key must come from memory. That means that the key may be put in the secure token, but that the key is exposed in memory regardless. Normally, secure tokens only work with keys that are either generated in the secure token or are injected by e.g. a smart card or a key ceremony. A KeyGenerator can be supplied with a provider so that the key is directly generated within the secure token.
As indicated in Duncan's answer: always specify the key size (and any other parameters) explicitly. Do not rely on provider defaults as this will make it unclear what your application is doing, and each provider may have its own defaults.

In other posts, I have found this, but using a SecretKeyFactory might be a better idea:
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""AES"");
SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom(); // cryptograph. secure random 
keyGen.init(random); 
SecretKey secretKey = keyGen.generateKey();

It would be great if the answer included an explanation of why it is a good way of generating the random key. Thanks!
","Lots of good advince in the other posts. This is what I use:
Key key;
SecureRandom rand = new SecureRandom();
KeyGenerator generator = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""AES"");
generator.init(256, rand);

If you need another randomness provider, which I sometime do for testing purposes, just replace rand with
MySecureRandom rand = new MySecureRandom();

","This error means that your Java virtual machine uses a policy that only allows restricted cryptography key sizes due to US export laws.
Java 9 and higher
The Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files are included with Java 9 and used by default (see Security Updates in the Java 9 Migration Guide).
If you get this error with Java 9, it might mean the policy configuration has been changed to a more restrictive policy (limited), see the instructions from the migration guide:

JCE Jurisdiction Policy File Default is Unlimited
If your application previously required the Java Cryptography
  Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files, then you
  no longer need to download or install them. They are included in the
  JDK and are activated by default.
If your country or usage requires a more restrictive policy, the
  limited Java cryptographic policy files are still available.
If you have requirements that are not met by either of the policy
  files provided by default, then you can customize these policy files
  to meet your needs.
See the crypto.policy Security property in the
  <java-home>/conf/security/java.security file, or 
  Cryptographic Strength Configuration in the Java Platform, 
  Standard Edition Security Developer's Guide.

Java 8 and earlier
Java 8 Update 161 and higher
Starting with Java 8 Update 161, Java 8 defaults to the Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy. If you receive this error, it could indicate the configuration has been changed to limited. See instructions in the next section on Java 8 Update 151, or the previous section on Java 9, for changing this back to unlimited.
Java 8 Update 151 and higher
Starting with Java 8 Update 151, the Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy is included with Java 8 but not used by default. To enable it, you need to edit the java.security file in <java_home>/jre/lib/security (for JDK) or <java_home>/lib/security (for JRE). Uncomment (or include) the line
crypto.policy=unlimited

Make sure you edit the file using an editor run as administrator.
The policy change only takes effect after restarting the JVM (this is especially important for long-running server processes like Tomcat).
For backwards compatibility, installing the policy files as documented in the next section will still work as well.
Before Java 8 Update 151
For Java 8 Update 144 and earlier, you need to install the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files (available at Oracle).
To install these files (from the README.txt in the download):


Download the unlimited strength JCE policy files.
Uncompress and extract the downloaded file.
This will create a subdirectory called jce.
  This directory contains the following files:
README.txt                   This file
local_policy.jar             Unlimited strength local policy file
US_export_policy.jar         Unlimited strength US export policy file

Install the unlimited strength policy JAR files.
In case you later decide to revert to the original ""strong"" but
  limited policy versions, first make a copy of the original JCE
  policy files (US_export_policy.jar and local_policy.jar). Then
  replace the strong policy files with the unlimited strength
  versions extracted in the previous step.
The standard place for JCE jurisdiction policy JAR files is:
<java-home>/lib/security           [Unix]
<java-home>\lib\security           [Windows]



Note for the JDK it is in jre/lib/security.
The new policy file only takes effect after restarting the JVM (this is especially important for long-running server processes like Tomcat).

","I stumbled on the same issue with SSLScokets and I think I identified the reason for this regression with Java 7. The reason comes to the ciphers negotiated between the client and the server.
By default Java 6 enables these ciphers for a TLS connection (in priority order) :
SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5
SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
SSL_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
SSL_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA
SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA
SSL_DHE_DSS_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA
SSL_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5
SSL_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
SSL_DHE_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
SSL_DHE_DSS_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
TLS_EMPTY_RENEGOTIATION_INFO_SCSV

And Java 7 enables these ciphers:
TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA
TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA
TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA

Ciphers using Diffie-Hellman come in higher priority on Java 7, but they don't seem to support keys longer than 1024 bits unless the strong crypto package is installed.

socket.setEnabledCipherSuites(new String[] {

","Some additions or clarifications:
(Suncle) Java 7 since 7u09 uses a more sensible consistent order of ciphersuites by default, unlike the seemingly random order in 7u04. (I don't have tests between 04 and 09.) This order puts ECDHE and plain-RSA (aka akRSA) before DHE, and thus avoids the problem if AND ONLY IF the server supports ECDHE or RSA and agrees to client preference. (Or ECDH-fixed, but practically nobody uses that.) If the server insists on DHE (for whatever reason) AND uses DH>1024 bits, you still have the problem.
If the asker (or anyone else) connects to a server that truly requires integer-DH (and not ECDH or RSA), the only way to work with Java before 8 is to get the server to use DH 1024-bit. Which AFAWK is technically secure for a few more years, but with a thin margin it is prohibited by important authorities like NIST (see Special Pub 800-57 at csrc.nist.gov). (Even RSA 1024 isn't actually broken yet, but it probably will be soon and so is prohibited.)
The ""unlimited strength policy"" is not relevant to this problem, or at least not directly, and the good answers to #6851461 did not say it is. It does not change the restriction on DH parameters in SunJCE, which is (wrongly) treated as a standard issue not a strength issue. (Specifically it takes the restrictions that used to be correct for DSA, and applies them to DH.) It does enable AES-256 and SHA-2 (only for TLSv1.2) suites, and given a sufficiently strange preference list, that might change the selection result from DHE (fails) to non-DHE (works).
You don't need to go entirely back to the Java 6 list, you just need to prioritize other key exchanges over DHE, or for a recalcitrant server drop DHE entirely. You definitely should NOT go back to enabling any EXPORT or single-DES suites, unless absolutely needed for a legacy server; they have been NOT SECURE for several years now, and remained enabled by default in 6 far longer than they should have.

Question: Does anybody see a problem with this approach?
Btw: In case you are using Apache HTTPClient, then https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCLIENT-1111 is interesting which shows how to set the CipherSuites (starting with HTTPClient v4.2) via the method 
SSLConnectionSocketFactory() {...}.prepareSocket(SSLSocket)

Update 2015/10/31:
To help better understand the context where to use this, here as full pseudo-code example where you see how to hook-in to override the prepareSocket() method:
HttpClientBuilder builder = HttpClients.custom();

SSLContextBuilder sslContextBuilder = SSLContexts.custom();
SSLContext sslContext = sslContextBuilder.build();

SSLConnectionSocketFactory sslsf = new SSLConnectionSocketFactory(sslContext, hostNameVerfier)
{


    protected void prepareSocket(SSLSocket socket) throws IOException {

    // Workaround to use different order of CipherSuites used by Java6 in order
        // to avoid the the problem of java7 ""Could not generate DH keypair""
        String[] enabledCipherSuites = socket.getEnabledCipherSuites();

        // but to avoid hardcoding a new list, we just remove the entries
        // which cause the exception (via TrialAndError)
        List<String> asList = new ArrayList(Arrays.asList(enabledCipherSuites));

        // we identified the following entries causeing the problems
        // ""Could not generate DH keypair""
        // and ""Caused by: java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: Prime size must be multiple of 64, and can only range from 512 to 1024 (inclusive)""
        asList.remove(""TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA"");
        asList.remove(""SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA"");
        asList.remove(""TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA"");

        String[] array = asList.toArray(new String[0]);
        socket.setEnabledCipherSuites(array);

    };
};

Registry<ConnectionSocketFactory> socketFactoryRegistry = RegistryBuilder.<ConnectionSocketFactory> create().register(""https"", sslsf).build();

PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager conman = new PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager(socketFactoryRegistry);
builder.setConnectionManager(conman);

CloseableHttpClient httpClient =  builder.build();

Be careful
We are using this piece of code only in a context where the user explicitly enables to trust self-signed certificates (e.g. for test-environments etc.). If you don't want to do this, then better don't mess with the SSL-stuff.

I tried replacing the jar files for JCE unlimited but still get the same error. The bug is reported since 2007, but why does it run for Java 6 and not for Java 7?

","For a very comprehensive explanation of the issue that includes the text of the PKCS#5 and PKCS#7 cryptographic standards, please take a look here.

PKCS#5 padding means padding 1 to 8 bytes. The padding bytes themselves contain the amount of padding bytes encoded as a byte. PKCS#5 padding was specified for DES, but it would be suitable for any block cipher with a block size of 8 bytes.
Now the DES specifications and even the PKCS#5 specification for password based encryption precede and Java by quite a long time. AES was only standardized in 2002, long after Java and even Java 2 was introduced. So (triple) DES and PKCS#5 padding was integrated into Java before AES made its appearance.
When Java - or more precisely, the Sun JCE provider - gained AES functionality it required a padding method for a block size of 16 bytes. PKCS#7 specifies this padding method that is identical to PKCS#5 padding, except that it is defined for block sizes of 2 to 255 bytes (the maximum  value of a byte if it encodes a zero based unsigned integer). However, the padding method was already there; it was named ""PKCS5Padding"". So instead of introducing a new name, ""PKCS5Padding"" was simply re-used.
By now the Sun provider should really support ""PKCS7Padding"" as PKCS#5 padding is simply incorrect. It's not just a Java naming issue, it's an issue for any developer that tries to implement cryptographic protocols or port other applications to Java. For now however, you should use ""PKCS5Padding"" instead of ""PKCS7Padding"".

","The ability to sign certificates is not part of a standard Java library or extension.
A lot of the code that is needed to do it yourself is part of the core. There are classes to encode and decode X.500 names, X.509 certificate extensions, public keys for various algorithms, and of course, for actually performing the digital signature.
Implementing this yourself is not trivial, but it is definitely doable—I probably spent 4 or 5 full days the first time I made a working prototype for certificate signing. It was a fantastic learning exercise for me, but it's hard to justify that expense when there are usable libraries available for free.

It's probably a good idea to remove the old policy JAR's if they were added earlier, as Oracle states in the release notes:

Because the old JCE jurisdiction files are left in
  /lib/security, they may not meet the latest security JAR
  signing standards, which were refreshed in 6u131, 7u121, 8u111, and
  later updates.

Older Versions
Answers suggesting to install the JCE files via Homebrew won't work anymore, as the casks were deleted from the Homebrew repository after release of the Java 8 Update 151. If using an older version of Java 8, you can refer to the accepted answer.

Unlimited Strength Java Cryptography Extension
Due to import control restrictions for some countries, the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) policy files shipped with the Java SE Development Kit and the Java SE Runtime Environment allow strong but limited cryptography to be used.
An unlimited strength version of these files indicating no restrictions on cryptographic strengths is available on the JDK web site for those living in eligible countries.  Those living in eligible countries may download the unlimited strength version and replace the strong cryptography jar files with the unlimited strength files.
Questions

Does every JDK bundle comes with local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar ?
What is the limitation in default local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar. Is it the key size ?
If I need to use 128 bit keys does it required to go for Unlimited Strength Java Cryptography
Extension
Is there a way I can keep these two jars in external path and load it. Because I have more 50 servers rather than coping in each JDK I would prefer to maintain it in a central place. 

","
Does every JDK bundle comes with local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar ?

yup. JCE has been integrated into the Java 2 SDK since the 1.4 release.

What is the limitation in default local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar. Is it the key size ?

Yes it is the key size. I thing more than 128 bit is not allowed. You can check the maximum size of the algorithm using int maxKeyLen = Cipher.getMaxAllowedKeyLength(""AES""); 

If I need to use 128 bit keys does it required to go for Unlimited Strength Java Cryptography Extension

For 128 bit key encryption I dont think you need Unlimited Strength Java Cryptography Extension jars. Default ones should work just fine.

Is there a way I can keep these two jars in external path and load it. Because I have more 50 servers rather than coping in each JDK I would prefer to maintain it in a central place. 

As mentioned above this scenario should not occur if you are using 128 bit key for encryption but if you are using more lengthy key (Eg 256) you will need to get unlimited strength jars and replace them in $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security. As it is in the JDK/JRE itself you cannot make it centralized not in case of distributed servers. You will need to replace it on each of your servers.
Refer oracles reference guide.
Also if you don't want to do this you can refer to following thread for alternatives - 
How to avoid installing “Unlimited Strength” JCE policy files when deploying an application?
Reflection is user in the thread as a work around. Though I would not recommend it you can take a look at it.

","Your comment on Thom's answer is correct. The JRE path is /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/, and the JCE files are then under lib/security/.
I happen to have multiple JVMs installed, so I thought it was worth showing a way to check whether a particular JVM has the correct files. These are some commands you can use to determine whether a given Java installation is configured correctly:
find ~/Downloads/UnlimitedJCEPolicy -name *.jar |xargs md5
cd /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/  # -OR-
cd '/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/'
find . \( -name local_policy.jar -or -name US_export_policy.jar \) |xargs md5

Once you know the path to the files, you can replace them as-needed. Keep in mind that each version of Java may require different JCE libraries. You may need separate jars for 6, 7, and 8, depending on compatibility.

From here you can use this executable and find to locate these files

And combine that with @ngreen's answer to get the md5 of these files (if you want)
find ~/Downloads/UnlimitedJCEPolicy -name *.jar |xargs md5
# MD5 (/Users/nperry/Downloads/UnlimitedJCEPolicy/local_policy.jar) = 9dd69bcc7637d872121880c35437788d

Backup the original files if you want
mkdir ~/Downloads/JCEPolicy-originals-1.7/
cp $(find $(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.7) -name local_policy.jar)     ~/Downloads/JCEPolicy-originals-1.7/
cp $(find $(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.7) -name US_export_policy.jar) ~/Downloads/JCEPolicy-originals-1.7/

You can replace the files with this.
sudo cp ~/Downloads/UnlimitedJCEPolicy/local_policy.jar $(find $(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.7) -name local_policy.jar)
sudo cp ~/Downloads/UnlimitedJCEPolicy/US_export_policy.jar $(find $(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.7) -name US_export_policy.jar)

One note: I've seen that on Java 1.4 and maybe 1.5 levels, the output with option ""all"" is not as complete as it is using the same option on the Java 1.6 level. E.g., 1.6 shows the actual contents of network (socket) reads and writes. Maybe some levels of 1.4 and 1.5 do as well, but 1.6 was more consistent.

","For JBoss AS7 bouncy castle needs to be deployed as a server module. This replaces the server/default/lib mechanism of earlier versions (as mentioned in Gergely Bacso's answer).
JBoss AS7 uses jdk1.6+. When using JBoss AS7 with jdk1.6 we need to make sure we are using bcprov-jdk16.
Create a Jboss module (a folder $JBOSS_HOME/modules/org/bouncycastle/main).
Put the bouncy castle jars that you want to be globally available in it, along with a module.xml file that looks like this:  
<module xmlns=""urn:jboss:module:1.1"" name=""org.bouncycastle"">
    <resources>
        <resource-root path=""bcprov-jdk16-1.46.jar""/>
    </resources>
    <dependencies>
        <module name=""javax.api"" slot=""main"" export=""true""/>
    </dependencies>
</module>

Once you have setup the module you need to make it available to your deployments. There are two ways:
1. Globally via standalone.xml
In $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml replace
<subsystem xmlns=""urn:jboss:domain:ee:1.0""/>

with  
<subsystem xmlns=""urn:jboss:domain:ee:1.0"">
    <global-modules>
        <module name=""org.bouncycastle"" slot=""main""/>
    </global-modules>
</subsystem>

The jar libraries will now be available across all applications (and this will ""emulate"" adding to the classpath as was possible in jboss 4,5,6 etc)
2. For a specific deployment (preferred)
Add a module dependency entry to the ear's META-INF/jboss-deployment-structure.xml file, under the  section, eg:
<jboss-deployment-structure xmlns=""urn:jboss:deployment-structure:1.1"">
    <deployment>
        <dependencies>
            <module name=""org.bouncycastle"" slot=""main"" export=""true"" />

","But if You change server from JBoss to other (for example Glassfish) You have the same problem.
The better solition for me are changes in jdk.
You shoud add Bouncy Castle to security providers on Your java platform in two steps:
1. Copy BC librarys (currently bcpkix-jdk15on-149.jar, bcprov-jdk15on-149.jar) to directory $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext/
2. Register BC provider: edit file $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security and under line
security.provider.1=sun.security.provider.Sun

add Your BC provider
security.provider.2=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider

Change numbers of rest providers. The whole block of providers should be similar to:
security.provider.1=sun.security.provider.Sun
security.provider.2=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider
security.provider.3=sun.security.rsa.SunRsaSign
security.provider.4=sun.security.ec.SunEC
security.provider.5=com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Provider
security.provider.6=com.sun.crypto.provider.SunJCE
security.provider.7=sun.security.jgss.SunProvider
security.provider.8=com.sun.security.sasl.Provider
security.provider.9=org.jcp.xml.dsig.internal.dom.XMLDSigRI

","I think you could probably use Cipher.getMaxAllowedKeyLength(), while also comparing the cypher you're using to known lists of ""good"", secure cyphers, such as AES.
Here's a reference article that lists maximum key size jurisdiction limitations that were current as of Java 1.4 (these likely haven't changed, unless the law has also changed - see below).
If you are operating in a nation that has cryptographic export/import restrictions, you'd have to consult the law in your nation, but it's probably safe to assume in these situations that you don't have unlimited strength cryptography available (by default) in your JVM. Putting it another way, assuming you're using the official JVM from Oracle, and you happen to live in a nation against which the U.S. has leveled export restrictions for cryptography (and since Oracle is a United States company, it would be subject to these restrictions), then you could also assume in this case that you don't have unlimited strength available.
Of course, that doesn't stop you from building your own, and thereby granting yourself unlimited strength, but depending on your local laws, that might be illegal.
This article outlines the restrictions on export to other nations, from the Unites States.

","In the same spirit as the answer of Dan Cruz, but with a single line of code and without  going trough exceptions:

So a complete program might be:

public class TestUCE {

","Your signature string contains 256 characters, however this is hexadecimal and really represents 128 bytes.
Before you verify the signature, you must convert it back to a byte array. This is not achieved through someString.getBytes() but rather via DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary(someString) (or any other method you prefer from Google).
Also, I would strongly recommend you use the Signature class rather than the Cipher class when signing messages. Currently your code can only handle messages that are smaller than 128 bytes in length (smaller, in fact, due to padding). Instead, you should be hashing the message prior to signing (e.g. using the SHA256withRSA mechanism).

However the #2 code shows following error:

I think the line in #1 Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding"");
generates 2048 bits (256 bytes) result. Perhaps this is the problem... remember that I use 1024 bit private key.
So how can the #1 code generate 128-byte result?

"1756801","How to sign a custom JCE security provider","Sun's PKCS11 JCE security provider is lacking some functionality we need.
So I wrote an enhanced version of it using the original sources.
Unfortunately the JCE infrastructure rejects the new provider
""JCE cannot authenticate the provider""
because it is not properly signed.
javax.crypto.JceSecurity.verifyProviderJar(...) throws.
(it calls javax.crypto.JarVerifier.verify())
Any suggestions how to sign the new provider to make it 
work with JCE?
","The process is described in the document, ""How to Implement a Provider.""
It involves emailing Sun Oracle some information (including the CSR you generated for your signing key), then faxing a confirmation document. Getting your signed certificate back can take a week or more, so plan ahead. 
You only need to sign your provider if it provides services that are restricted by some (repressive) governments. For example, a Cipher implementation is a restricted ""service,"" while MessageDigest is an unrestricted service. I assume with the message you're getting, that you are trying to provide a restricted services.
If you provide any of these services, there's no way around it: You need a code-signing certificate issued by Sun. (One from IBM might work too; if I recall correctly, their code-signing CA is supported, but I don't know anything about their issuing process.)

","You have to sign the JAR with ""JCE Code Signing CA"". In all current Java distributions, only 2 CAs (Sun and IBM) are built-in (hard-coded) and there is no way to add your own. We tried to work with Sun to sign our provider and it's almost impossible. They wouldn't issue intermediate CA cert, which means you have to go through the trouble every time you make a change.
Why don't you just user your own library? You use standard API for interoperability between different JCEs. But that's not realistic for CryptoKi/SmartCard stuff right now, you almost always need to write some custom code to interact with vendor specific API. You can even make your code mimic JCE API to minimize code changes.

","An alternative is to design your custom provider using OpenJDK. This is the open-source project sponsored by Sun/Oracle, and provides the code base for their official release. OpenJDK does not require providers to be signed. OpenJDK is available (by default, now) on several Linux distributions. Unfortunately, it does not seem to be readily available on Windows or Macintosh. If you're running Windows or Macintosh, I recommend installing Linux into a VM.
If you must develop on Windows or Mac, however, you can copy the jce.jar file from an OpenJDK install over jce.jar (in your Java lib directory) of an official install. This will effectively circumvent the Jar authentication process. Be sure to put the original jce.jar file back when you're done developing, though.

How are you creating the SecretKey instance? What error message to you get?

The Java code in your question is using DES, not ""Triple DES"". The algorithm name should be ""DESede/CBC/PKCS5Padding"". The code in your answer probably works because you got the algorithm right, not because you switched providers. The SunJCE provider in Java 6 will accept 128-bit keys (and use keying option 2). I am not sure about older versions.

","In the jPOS project, the problem is worked around by always using either single-length (8-byte) or triple-length (24-byte) keys. Let's say your clear double-length key (in bytes) is AAAAAAAA BBBBBBBB. All code in the jPOS project I've seen so far that uses the JCE appends the first 8 bytes again to the clear key, so it becomes a triple-length key as such: AAAAAAAA BBBBBBBB AAAAAAAA. It seems the Sun provider does accept this material for creating a SecreKeySpec, as it is 192 bits long, as @erickson mentioned.

I want to do this using the bouncy castle library but I don't know why I cannot get it to work by using the JCE interface...
The problem is that generating the hash in 3 different modes: 
 1. using the PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 secret key factory provided by sun 
 2. using the bouncy castle api directly 
 3. using the bouncy castle through JCE 
results in 2 distinct values: one common to the first two and one for the third.
Here is my code:
    //Mode 1

    SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1"");
    KeySpec keyspec = new PBEKeySpec(""password"".toCharArray(), salt, 1000, 128);
    Key key = factory.generateSecret(keyspec);

    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(key.getEncoded()));

    //Mode 2

    generator.init(PBEParametersGenerator.PKCS5PasswordToUTF8Bytes((""password"").toCharArray()), salt, 1000);
    KeyParameter params = (KeyParameter)generator.generateDerivedParameters(128);
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(params.getKey()));

    //Mode 3

    SecretKeyFactory factorybc = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBEWITHHMACSHA1"", ""BC"");
    KeySpec keyspecbc = new PBEKeySpec(""password"".toCharArray(), salt, 1000, 128);
    Key keybc = factorybc.generateSecret(keyspecbc);
    System.out.println(keybc.getClass().getName());
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(keybc.getEncoded()));
    System.out.println(keybc.getAlgorithm());

I know that PBKDF2 is implemented using HMAC SHA1 so that is why i chose as algorithm in the last method the ""PBEWITHHMACSHA1"" which i took from the bouncy castle java docs.
The output is the following:

PBEwithHmacSHA

Any ideas?
","In short, the reason for the difference is that PBKDF2 algorithm in modes #1 and #2 uses PKCS #5 v2 scheme 2 (PKCS5S2) for iterative key generation, but the BouncyCastle provider for ""PBEWITHHMACSHA1"" in mode #3 uses the PKCS #12 v1 (PKCS12) algorithm instead. These are completely different key-generation algorithms, so you get different results.
More detail on why this is so and why you get different sized results is explained below.
First, when you're constructing a JCE KeySpec, the keyLength parameter only expresses ""a preference"" to the provider what key size you want. From the API docs:

Note: this is used to indicate the preference on key length for variable-key-size ciphers. The actual key size depends on each provider's implementation.

The Bouncy Castle providers don't appear to respect this parameter, judging from the source of JCEPBEKey, so you should expect to get a 160-bit key back from any BC provider which uses SHA-1 when using the JCE API.
You can confirm this by programmatically accessing the getKeySize() method on the returned keybc variable in your test code:
Key keybc = factorybc.generateSecret(keyspecbc);
// ...
Method getKeySize = JCEPBEKey.class.getDeclaredMethod(""getKeySize"");
getKeySize.setAccessible(true);
System.out.println(getKeySize.invoke(keybc)); // prints '160'

Now, to understand what the ""PBEWITHHMACSHA1"" provider corresponds to, you can find the following in the source for BouncyCastleProvider:
put(""SecretKeyFactory.PBEWITHHMACSHA1"", 
    ""org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JCESecretKeyFactory$PBEWithSHA"");

And the implementation of JCESecretKeyFactory.PBEWithSHA looks like this:
public static class PBEWithSHA
    extends PBEKeyFactory
{
    public PBEWithSHA()
    {
        super(""PBEwithHmacSHA"", null, false, PKCS12, SHA1, 160, 0);
    }
}

You can see above that this key factory uses the PKCS #12 v1 (PKCS12) algorithm for iterative key generation. But the PBKDF2 algorithm that you want to use for password hashing uses PKCS #5 v2 scheme 2 (PKCS5S2) instead. This is why you're getting different results.
I had a quick look through the JCE providers registered in BouncyCastleProvider, but couldn't see any key generation algorithms that used PKCS5S2 at all, let alone one which also uses it with HMAC-SHA-1.
So I guess you're stuck with either using the Sun implementation (mode #1 above) and losing portability on other JVMs, or using the Bouncy Castle classes directly (mode #2 above) and requiring the BC library at runtime.
Either way, you should probably switch to 160-bit keys, so you aren't truncating the generated SHA-1 hash unnecessarily.

"10043376","Java X509 Certificate parsing and validating","I'm trying to process X509 certificates in several steps and running into a couple of problems. I'm new to JCE so I not completely up to date on everything yet.
We want to be able to parse several different X509 certificates based on different encodings (PEM, DER and PCKS7). I've exported the same certificate from https://belgium.be in PEM and PCKS7 format using FireFox (certificate including chain). I've left couple lines out that are not needed for the questions
public List<X509Certificate> parse(FileInputStream fis) {  
    /*
     * Generate a X509 Certificate initialized with the data read from the inputstream. 
     * NOTE: Generation fails when using BufferedInputStream on PKCS7 certificates.
     */
    List<X509Certificate> certificates = null;
      log.debug(""Parsing new certificate."");
      certificates = (List<X509Certificate>) cf.generateCertificates(fis);
    return certificates;
  }

This code is working fine aslong as I work with a FileInputStream instead of a BufferedInputStream for PCKS7, which is quite strange already I think? But I can live with it.
The next step is to validate these certificate chains.
1) Check if all certificates have a valid date (easy)
2) Validate certificate chain using OCSP (and fallback to CRL if no OCSP URL is found in the certificate). This is where I'm not completely sure how to handle this.
I'm using the Sun JCE, but it seems there is not that much documentation available (in examples) for this?
I first made a simple implementation that only checks the chain without going through the OCSP/CRL checks.
private Boolean validateChain(List<X509Certificate> certificates) {
    PKIXParameters params;
    CertPath certPath;
    CertPathValidator certPathValidator;
    Boolean valid = Boolean.FALSE;

    params = new PKIXParameters(keyStore);
    params.setRevocationEnabled(false);

    certPath = cf.generateCertPath(certificates);
    certPathValidator = CertPathValidator.getInstance(""PKIX"");

    PKIXCertPathValidatorResult result = (PKIXCertPathValidatorResult)  
    certPathValidator.validate(certPath, params);

      if(null != result) {
        valid = Boolean.TRUE;
      }
    return valid;
 }

This is working fine for my PEM certificate, but not for the PCKS7 certificate (same certifcate, only exported in other format).
java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Path does not chain with any of the trust anchors.
The only difference I'm able to see is that the order in which the CertPath is formed is not the same? I was not able to figure out what was going wrong so I left this for now and kept on going with the PEM certificate, but lets call this QUESTION 1 ;)
What I wanted to implement afterwards was the OCSP checking.
Apparently if I enable OCSP using:  Security.setProperty(""ocsp.enable"", ""true""); and set    params.setRevocationEnabled(true);
it should be able to find the OCSP URL on its own, but that does not seem to be the case. What is the standard implementation supposed to do (QUESTION 2)? 
java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Must specify the location of an OCSP Responder
Going past this, I found a way to retrieve the OCSP url from the certificate using AuthorityInfoAccessExtension and such.
But after setting the OCSP url manually in the ocsp.url property, I'm getting an java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: OCSP response error: UNAUTHORIZED
It seems like I'm missing a lot of necessary steps while alot of online references say setting the ocsp.enable property should be all you need to do? 
Perhaps any of you whizkids cant guide me through the process a little bit? Show me where I'm completely wrong :)
The next step would be implementing CRL checks if no OCSP was found, if anyone could point out any example or show me some documentation on this it would also be much appreciated!
Thanks!
EDIT:
Since it's not picking up the properties on its own, I've been trying to set all the properties myself using the following:
    // Activate OCSP
        Security.setProperty(""ocsp.enable"", ""true"");
        // Activate CRLDP -- no idea what this is
        Security.setProperty(""com.sun.security.enableCRLDP"", ""true"");

        X509Certificate target = (X509Certificate) certPath.getCertificates().get(0);
        Security.setProperty(""ocsp.responderURL"",""http://ocsp.pki.belgium.be/"");
        Security.setProperty(""ocsp.responderCertIssuerName"", target.getIssuerX500Principal().getName());
        Security.setProperty(""ocsp.responderCertSubjectName"", target.getSubjectX500Principal().getName());
        Security.setProperty(""ocsp.responderCertSerialNumber"", target.getSerialNumber().toString(16));

Which gives an exception:
java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Cannot find the responder's certificate (set using the OCSP security properties).
","For future reference I'll post the answer to my own question (partly atleast)
OCSP and CRL checks are implemented in the standard Java implementation already and there is no need for custom code or other providers (BC, ..). They are disabled by default.
To enable this, you have to atleast set two parameters:
(PKIXParameters or PKIXParameterBuilder) params.setRevocationEnabled(true);
Security.setProperty(""ocsp.enable"", ""true"");

This will activate OCSP checking when you are trying to validate the certificate path (PKIXCertPathValidatorResult.validate()).
When you want to add the fallback check for CRL if no OCSP is available, add an aditional property:
System.setProperty(""com.sun.security.enableCRLDP"", ""true"");

A lot of my problems are happening due to the fact that I have to support different certificate formats (PKCS7, PEM). My implementation works fine for PEM, but since PKCS7 does NOT save ordering of the certificates in the chain it is a bit harder (http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6238093)
X509CertSelector targetConstraints = new X509CertSelector();

targetConstraints.setCertificate(certificates.get(0));
// Here's the issue for PKCS7 certificates since they are not ordered,
// but I havent figured out how I can see what the target certificate
// (lowest level) is in the incoming certificates..

PKIXBuilderParameters params = new PKIXBuilderParameters(anchors, targetConstraints);   

Hope this will be useful remarks for other people as well, perhaps someone can shed a light on how to find the target certificate in an unordered PKCS7 list?

","I see you've already gone over to the BouncyCastle side of the house but just in case anyone else was wondering; you can add the cert chain to the entry when putting the key into the KeyStore. For example

keyStore.load([keystore stream], password.toCharArray());// or null, null if it's a brand new store

","I found a different solution (although via the link that srkavin posted) that doesn't even require using BouncyCastle:

I read Oracle Java 8 should support these protocols, but maybe that's not supported by OpenJDK? Or should I enable it somehow?
Update
Oracle's JCE cryptographic provider is installed under jre/lib/security/, but it didn't help. 
","Try installing the JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files (these should help with your higher bit ciphers)
Also note, in the link you provided about java 8 cipher protocol support says 

Cipher suites that use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECDSA, ECDH, ECDHE, ECDH_anon) require a JCE cryptographic provider ...

Did you install such a provider on your Java 8 VM?

Update
Oracle's JCE cryptographic provider is installed under jre/lib/security/, but it didn't help. 
","So I'm running a similar setup, with an AWS box running openjdk-1.8.0.51.
what solved it for me is to add bouncycastle as a provider like so:

Add the bcprov-<verion>.jar to /usr/lib/jvm/jre/lib/ext
Edit /usr/lib/jvm/jre/lib/security/java.security adding the following line to the list of providers: 
security.provider.6=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider


(I added it as the 6th entry but you can add higher in the order if you prefer)
Restarted my application and was able to use EC-based cipher suites such as TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256.

I read Oracle Java 8 should support these protocols, but maybe that's not supported by OpenJDK? Or should I enable it somehow?
Update
Oracle's JCE cryptographic provider is installed under jre/lib/security/, but it didn't help. 
","The root cause is that OpenJDK on CentOS/RHEL/Amazon Linux with OpenJDK on them simply do not ship with the required native libraries to support EC. The Unlimited Policy Files are a red herring, as are any attempts to un-disable various algorithms, etc. If the libraries aren't there, you can't use the features.
The accepted answer of ""install Bouncy Castle"" works because BC provides a pure-Java implementation of all the desired algorithms. Ideally, the JDK would provide native implementations which would yield higher performance.
It looks like OpenJDK on Amazon Linux will just have to wait. :(

UPDATE 2016-11-09
It seems that Oracle's Elliptic curve native library (libsunec.so) is licensed under the GPL. You can confirm this by going to Oracle's download page, clicking on Third Party Licenses, and checking the README for your version of Java.
This means that, if you can grab a copy of Oracle's JRE/JDK for the target platform and architecture, you can take the libsunec.so library from it and install it legally into the OpenJDK installation.
For me, that meant grabbing the file $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/amd64/libsunec.so from an Oracle Java 8 JRE and dropping it into e.g. /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.8.0/lib/amd64/. That is all that is required in order to enable Elliptic-Curve algorithms.
UPDATE 2018-03-08
Oracle Java 9 will include the ""unlimited strength cryptography"" libraries enabled by default, so that's nice. It looks like OpenJDK will still require you to set a system property to enable ""unlimited strength cryptography"".

","@T.Rob commented that you may have made a mistake in encrypting with the private key.  If ""everyone"" knows the public key, then anyone can decrypt your file.  IBM's JCE behaviour is thus protecting people against this mistake.
I can see the logic of that. 
However, there may be cases where you really do need to encrypt with the private key; e.g. as part of a protocol that needs to prove that you know the private key corresponding to a published public key.
If this is really what you want to do, you probably need to use a recent Sun JCE implementation (older Sun JCEs didn't implement RSA), or Bouncy Castle.

","I don't know this for sure but I believe that the JCE has an embedded policy limiting encryption to the public key and decryption to the private key.  
In the example code the encryption was done with the private key.  This would require the public key to decrypt, meaning that anyone with the public key could access the encoded data.  Although this has it's uses it is not the accepted pattern and the IBM implementation may be ""protecting"" you from accidentally creating encrypted data that was publicly readable.
The fact that it tested properly when these were reversed tends to confirm my suspicions but I haven't yet found an official document stating as much.

","IBM insists private keys cannot be used for encryption and public keys cannot be used for decryption, so they either see this artificial restriction as a feature, or someone is seriously confused here.
Here is how I worked around this problem:
RSAPrivateCrtKey privateKey = (RSAPrivateCrtKey) ks.getKey(keyAlias, ksPassword.trim().toCharArray());
RSAPublicKeySpec spec = new RSAPublicKeySpec(privateKey.getModulus(),privateKey.getPrivateExponent());
Key fakePublicKey = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"").generatePublic(spec);
encryptCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, fakePublicKey);

Essentially, I created a public key object with private key's crypto material. You will need to do the reverse, create a private key object with public key's crypto material, to decrypt with public key if you want to avoid the ""Public key cannot be used to decrypt"" exception.

","@Stephen C / @FelixM: IBM seems to be completely clueless about how RSA cryptography works and how it is intended to be used. Basically both operations (encrypt / decrypt) must be available for the public AND private key.
Encrypt with public key is needed to transmit the client-side part of the pre master secret in SSL/TLS handshakes. The server needs to decrypt with its private key. But if they negotiate something like ECDHE_RSA the server needs to SIGN parts of the handshake with the private key - thats encrypt with PrivateKey. Vice versa the client needs to decrypt with the public key from the certificate of the server to verify the hash value of the signature. (proving authenticity of the message)
So if I try to run ECDHE_RSA (server-side) on latest IBM JDK 7 the following happens:
java.security.InvalidKeyException: Private key cannot be used to encrypt.

As you can see we're using ""Signature"" and call ""initSign"", which requires indeed a PrivateKey. This proves IBM being clueless about this fact and obviously they don't even
have valid regression tests!
Use another crypto provider and don't believe IBM until they change their mind.

","I figured out what was wrong with my code.  Earlier in the code for some reason someone did the following:
if (SunJCEinProviders) 
{
Security.removeProvider(""SunJCE"");
}   

int i = Security.insertProviderAt(new  com.sun.crypto.provider.SunJCE(),1);

So for some reason we were removing javas initial SunJCE provider then adding a new one and this new one was failing to be authenticated.

I am not really sure how to use encrypt_mode to encrypt sessionKey. Could someone help me on this?
","Wrapping and encrypting are very similar, however wrapping expresses more precisely what you are planning to do. General ""encryption"" operates on raw data with no semantic meaning, whereas wrapping is known to relate to keys. Hence the Cipher.unwrap() method returns a Key not a byte array.
Your code will be more portable (particular with respect to hardware security modules) if you use wrap for doing key wrapping. In some circumstances, key permissions will allow a wrapping operation but not a raw encryption of the key bytes.
Of course, since the entirety of the JCE architecture is based on a provider concept, you will need to check exactly what algorithm to specify for your chosen provider to get the output format you want. This is particularly important if you are sending the wrapped key data to a third-party.

In your particular case, the same behaviour will be exhibited by both WRAP and ENCRYPT, as demonstrated below, where I interchange the results:
KeyPairGenerator generator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"", ""SunJSSE"");
generator.initialize(2048);
KeyPair keyPair = generator.generateKeyPair();

SecretKey sessionKey = new SecretKeySpec(new byte[16], ""AES"");

Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"", ""SunJCE"");
c.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, keyPair.getPublic());
byte[] result1 = c.doFinal(sessionKey.getEncoded());

c.init(Cipher.WRAP_MODE, keyPair.getPublic());
byte[] result2 = c.wrap(sessionKey);

c.init(Cipher.UNWRAP_MODE, keyPair.getPrivate());
SecretKey sessionKey1 = (SecretKey) c.unwrap(result1, ""AES"",
    Cipher.SECRET_KEY);

c.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, keyPair.getPrivate());
SecretKey sessionKey2 = new SecretKeySpec(c.doFinal(result2), ""AES"");

    sessionKey2.getEncoded()));

","With RSA you can only encrypt/decrypt block with size up to your key length minus padding length. If you have data longer than your key maybe it is just merged in one array so you should split it into chunks with size of your key (128 bytes suggests 1024 key with no padding, I'm not sure if it's possible). Using update() is not the case here.
Simply, you have to know how this array was created.
Generally speaking, RSA shouldn't be used to encrypt large amount of data as it's quite time consuming. Should be used to encrypt key to symmetric cipher, like AES.

The steps you should take encrypt are:

Generate RSA key pair (or retrieve public key from a key store)
Generate Symmetric key (AES)
Encrypt data with AES key
Encrypt AES key with public RSA key
Store (or send to person with private key) the encrypted AES key, and the AES Encrypted Data

To decrypt:

Get private key associated with that key pair used to encrypt
Decrypt AES key with private key
Decrypt data with AES key
Use data

"12937138","How does JCA/JCE and PKCS#11 work (together)?","I want to use a HSM (hardware security module) to create a signature of a XML file. I did a bit of research and am now a bit confused, though.
Can you please clarify those questions:

What is meant with a key handle in JCE? I have read about it, that it is just a handle and the key is stored somewhere else. How can that be? From my understanding I either load the key into memory and use it, or the signing is done completely by a HSM and I only get the result, right?
Does the PKCS#11 standard define a way so that the signature is generated in the HSM? I've read about tokens, but I am not sure about signing.
The featurelist of my HSM states JCE and PKCS#11 separately. What does that mean? 
I thought PKCS#11 is  a standard, and JCE defines classes to use that standard. Does JCE specify its own protocols?

","
What is meant with a key handle in JCE?
A key handle (in JCE, PKCS#11, or most other cryptographic APIs) is simply a reference that enables you to use a key without seeing its actual value. That is good: you can have the key permanently stored in a secure place (e.g. an HSM) with the assurance that nobody will be able to copy it and run away with it - as it may happen if the key is the application space. Unlike a physical safe though, you can still perform cryptographic operation without running any security risk of key leakage.
Does the PKCS#11 standard define a way so that the signature is generated in the HSM?
PKCS#11 is a C API for cryptographic tokens. A token is a PKCS#11 abstraction for any device or program that offers services described by such API. The API defines which operations you can perform using the objects inside the PKCS#11 token: some objects are non sensitive, and can be extracted (e.g. public keys); some others are sensitive and can only be used, via handles.
If you have a handle to an object that supports signing, you can use the C function C_Sign to ask the token to authenticate some data provided by your application. The key does not leave the HSM.
The featurelist of my HSM states JCE and PKCS#11 separately. What does that mean?
Your HSM supports JCE in the sense that it comes with a native library that qualifies as a   Cryptographic Service Provider.
It supports PKCS#11 in the sense that it comes with a native library that offers a C PKCS#11 API.
I thought PKCS#11 is a standard, and JCE defines classes to use that standard. Does JCE specify its own protocols?
Indeed PKCS#11 is a standard; but it is not directly usable by languages other than C. You need a mapping layer that translates it into something compatible to your language. A PKCS#11 library (and the physical tokens that it abstracts) can be mapped to a JCE provider.

However, a JCE provider may have nothing to do with PKCS#11.

    SecretKey tmp = factory.generateSecret(spec);
    SecretKey secret = new SecretKeySpec(tmp.getEncoded(), ""AES"");

    // given key above, our cippher will be aes-256-cbc in ruby/openssl

    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secret);
    AlgorithmParameters params = cipher.getParameters();

    // generate the intialization vector

Hex strings are used for the encrypted message and initialization vector since you can use OpenSSL to verify the encryption/decryption process (highly recommended).
Now from a Ruby program, you would use the AES-256-CBC cipher, and derive the secret key from the password and salt strings (not byte[] as per Java). Using the output from the above-mentioned Java program, we have:
# from Ruby-land
require 'openssl'

d = OpenSSL::Cipher.new(""AES-256-CBC"")
d.decrypt
key = OpenSSL::PKCS5.pbkdf2_hmac_sha1(""password"", ""8 bytes!"", 1024, d.key_len)
d.key = key
d.iv = ""ecbc985b3550edc977a17acc066f2192"".scan(/../).map{|b|b.hex}.pack('c*')
data = ""4a39f1a967c728e11c7a5a3fb5d73ad07561f504c9d084d0b1ae600cc1f75137cbb82a4d826c060cb06e2e283449738d"".scan(/../).map{|b|b.hex}.pack('c*')
d.update(data) << d.final
=> ""To Ruby, from Java, with love...""

You do get the parameters, but apparently no longer linked to the OID, which might make a difference.
In particular it may be treated as ""arbitrary"" or ""explicit"" in TLS and not work 
even though the TLS parties support that same curve by name.
Note that openssl uses the name prime256v1 but not everyone does. Java (sun.) uses secp256r1, or the OID.
If you are actually getting this pubkey from openssl, note that JCE can directly read the X.509 
SubjectPublicKeyInfo format, which openssl calls PUBKEY, including the named (OID) form.

Apparently in Java 9 you no longer need a zip, see:
http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/security-dev/2016-October/014943.html

Adding, 'Security.setProperty(“crypto.policy”, “unlimited”);' or

"20581169","Java Crypto Api - how to choose a cipher provider","In order to implement encryption using Java, I am using JCE, which is nice and fun.
I was told that it is better to choose the crypto provider than to use a default one.
I need to choose providers both for symmetric key generation. used by this code (using AES in CBC mode):
 Key sharedKey = (KeyGenerator.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING"", PROVIDER1).generateKey();

And for Asymmetric text encryption used by this code (using RSA in ECB mode):
Cipher rsaEncryptor = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding"",PROVIDER2); 

My question is how should I choose PROVIDER1 and PROVIDER2?
for example, I saw that ""SunJCE"" is a well documented provider, but I don't think it is a ""good enough"" reason to choose it.
anyone?
","In general, you should stick to the default provider, unless there is a compelling reason not to. Hard coding your provider has the serious drawback that your code won't allow you to change your provider without rewriting your code. The only reason I would see for choosing a provider directly is to make sure that some security constraints are met, that would not be present for other providers.
The following paragraph is directly from the Oracle documentation: 

Reminder: Cryptographic implementations in the JDK are distributed through several different providers (""Sun"", ""SunJSSE"", ""SunJCE"", ""SunRsaSign"") for both historical reasons and by the types of services provided. General purpose applications SHOULD NOT request cryptographic services from specific providers. That is:
getInstance(""..."", ""SunJCE"");  // not recommended
    vs.
getInstance(""..."");            // recommended



You can still manage to allow other providers to be used by giving them a higher priority (a lower priority indicator, 1 is highest priority) within the java.security file within the jre/lib/security path of your runtime. If you want to specify the provider using getInstance(""Algorithm"", ""Provider"") it might be a good idea to make the provider string configurable (e.g. using properties and using myConfig.getProperty(""Provider"")).

This is probably the only provider for your runtime that will generate RSA key pairs. Note that encryption is part of javax.security, which means that it was originally an optional package/provider (because of import/export control of cryptography).
RSA key creation is not encryption so it is included with SunRsaSign which provides RSA signature generation. As signatures are not used to provide confidentiality they are regarded as less sensitive cryptographic operations.

"22333550","Encrypt String using PBEWithMD5AndDES to compare to stored hash with Java","I am working with an application that stores challenge responses in some type of md5 hash.  There is an api method to check that all the responses are correct, but for some reason there is not a method to check one response which is a requirement that I have.  I'm not trying to decrypt. I'm just trying to encrypt the same way the application is doing it in order to compare. I do have a JCE library.  I'm afraid I'm pretty new to encryption so please help a noob out with a detailed answer.  Here's what I've gathered from a properties file:
algorithm=PBEWithMD5AndDES
password=pooface
digest=MD5

A sample hash looks like this:
MD5:MXgxY21tdXR4bjB0:oRu+jlpCO/eSdwMb0iTVbw==

They all return MD5:<16chars>:<24chars>.  Any guidance is helpful. Thanks in advance.
","Not really an ""Answer"", but a few pointers:

In the absence of documentation, you'd probably be best off reverse-engineering the API implementation (if you have it, and it's legal) to figure out what it's doing. (From a point of principle, you ought to be in a position to demand documentation of the algorithm that the API uses to hash (or otherwise) the passwords, otherwise it's security-by-obscurity). In the absence of that:
The oRu+jlpCO/eSdwMb0iTVbw== is Base64-encoded binary. If you Base64-decode it you get 128 bits, which is the size of an MD5 hash: 0xa11bbe8e5a423bf79277031bd224d56f.
The MXgxY21tdXR4bjB0 is probably a salt (i.e. something added to the received password to protect against dictionary attacks: MD5(""password"") is known and easily pre-computed, whereas MD5(""MXgxY21tdXR4bjB0password"") isn't). This, together with the previous point, suggest that you compute the MD5 hash of the salt plus something else to produce the 128 bits that are produced by Base64-decoding the oRu... data.
PBE stands for password-based encryption, i.e. generate a symmetric key (using MD5 in this case) from a password (perhaps pooface in this case...) then use that key to encrypt something (perhaps encrypt the user's password) with DES. See ""AlgorithmParameters Algorithms"" in http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html, and PKCS#5: http://www.emc.com/emc-plus/rsa-labs/standards-initiatives/pkcs-5-password-based-cryptography-standard.htm.
DES is a block cipher with a block size of 64 bits, so the output (i.e. ciphertext) will be a multiple of 64 bits long. It's possible that this is stored directly in your sample hash, but unlikely, not least because that would mean that the ""MD5"" in your sample hash line would be meaningless.
I suspect (but it's only a guess) that:

Use PBEWithMD5AndDes to derive a DES key based on the password ""pooface"".
Encrypt the user's password with that DES key.
Hash the salt and ciphertext with MD5, giving 128 bits of hash output.
Base64-encode the hash to give you the oRu... value.

Other things to consider:

The salt might be used to derive the encryption key.
The salt might be used within the encryption.
You say ""challenge response"": this probably means that the authenticating application invents a challenge (probably a random number), then gets the client to compute something based on this challenge and knowledge of some secret. The challenge might be the salt (but there are a few reasons why that might not be the case).
In the PBE you have two inputs: the password (used to derive the encryption key), and the thing being encrypted. I've assumed that response is encrypted using a key derived (using PBE/MD5) from ""pooface"". It's possible that this is the wrong way round: derive a key (using PBE/MD5) using the challenge response, and use that to encrypt ""pooface"". That seems less likely to me though.


Presumably you can create your own user with a known password (or challenge response, or whatever they call it), i.e. you can provide known input and see what output you end up with. That's useful from a reversing perspective. When figuring out what crypto is going on, I'd also use a few utilities:

Write a Java prog that takes a password and outputs a DES encryption key (i.e. implements PBEWithMD5AndDes).
Familiarise yourself with the openssl command, which will do MD5 hashing, DES encryption and Base64 (en|de)coding on demand.

BTW, using MD5 and DES is a bit poor these days...

If I'm reading the output correctly (and I may not be) the handshake process settled on using aes128-cbc for key exchange and hmac-md5 for the actual session encryption. According to the JSCH documentation (minimal though it may be), both of these algorithms are supported.
I can connect to this share with both the sftp command-line utility and with FileZilla, so the problem has to either be with JSCH or with my Java configuration, but I'm at a loss to figure out what's what.

Some people suggest installing JCE (Java Cryptography Extensions) to solve this problem, so I gave it a shot, but I still get the same error after copying the appropriate jar files into the /libs/security directory and restarting the application. We confirmed that JCE was installed by executing this script and noting that the exception was not thrown.
I also tried connecting to the remote SFTP share from the terminal using the sftp command in verbose mode. Here's what I got:

If I'm reading the output correctly (and I may not be) the handshake process settled on using aes128-cbc for key exchange and hmac-md5 for the actual session encryption. According to the JSCH documentation (minimal though it may be), both of these algorithms are supported.
I can connect to this share with both the sftp command-line utility and with FileZilla, so the problem has to either be with JSCH or with my Java configuration, but I'm at a loss to figure out what's what.

If I'm reading the output correctly (and I may not be) the handshake process settled on using aes128-cbc for key exchange and hmac-md5 for the actual session encryption. According to the JSCH documentation (minimal though it may be), both of these algorithms are supported.
I can connect to this share with both the sftp command-line utility and with FileZilla, so the problem has to either be with JSCH or with my Java configuration, but I'm at a loss to figure out what's what.
Java version:
java version ""1.7.0_71""
OpenJDK Runtime Environment
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.65-b04, mixed mode)

JSCH version:
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.jcraft</groupId>
    <artifactId>jsch</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.51</version>
</dependency>

Thanks in advance!
EDIT: It looks like a bug for this exact behaviour was filed against the JDK, but was closed with no resolution. There's also an email thread between the maintainers of JSCH and the JDK developers that discusses the issue, but has no resolution.
","You can force JSCH to use SHA256 instead of SHA1 with keysize > 1024 (which JSSE doesn't allow anymore) like this:
java.util.Properties configuration = new java.util.Properties();
configuration.put(""kex"", ""diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256"");           
configuration.put(""StrictHostKeyChecking"", ""no"");

"2653591","Decrypting “long” message encrypted with RSA java","Hi this is the same question, that was asked two years ago:
Java/JCE: Decrypting “long” message encrypted with RSA
I had a large byte array and rsa keypair, initiated by value 1024.
Using rsa encryption and the specified size of the key is strong requirement, I can't change it. So I can't use symmetric encryption with asymetric encryption symmetric key. I can't use any other keys. I had a byte array and need ciphered byte array to be returned. I wonder if there is any ready tool, that can manage with this problem? 
Sorry for such an amateurish question, but I really need a help.
","As stated, your question has a single answer, and that's ""no"". RSA encryption is an algorithm which encrypts messages up to a given size, which depends on the key size; with a 1024-bit RSA key, and RSA as the standard describes it, the maximum size is 117 bytes, no more. There is no way to encrypt a larger message with RSA alone, and that's a definite, mathematical certainty.
If you really need to process longer messages, then you necessarily have to add something else. In that case, please, please, do not try to do anything fancy of your own devising with some oh-so-clever splitting of data into small blocks and the like. That path leads to doom. You might produce something which appears to compile and run, but which will be invariably weak in some way, like almost every other home-made variation on cryptography. That's because security cannot be tested: it is not a case of ""works"" or ""does not work"".
The well-trodden path of asymmetric encryption goes thus:

You select a random sequence of bytes of some appropriate length, e.g. 128 bits (that's 16 bytes). Let's call it K.
You encrypt K with the RSA public key; this yields E.
You encrypt the message with K using a symmetric encryption algorithm (""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding""). Since this is a one-shot key, you can use an all-zeros IV. This yields a bunch of bytes, let's call it F.
The encrypted message is then the concatenation of E and F.

Decryption proceeds in the reverse order: the RSA private key is used to recover K from E, then K is used to decrypt F into the original message. The key K is never stored anywhere, and a new key K is generated every time (even if you encrypt the same message twice). That's important, do not change that unless you understand what you are doing (and if you do, then you already know that).
Given what you state about your problem, you have to do something else than ""just RSA"". The procedure I describe above is about the best ""something else"" that you could come up with, security-wise.
Assembling some cryptographic elements into such a protocol is a process fraught with pitfalls so you may have better luck using an already defined format and support library. Two common formats for asymmetric encryption are CMS and OpenPGP. A library which supports both and has good reputation is Bouncy Castle.

Some of the parts of the message (XML) must be encrypted because of the type of information transmitted. I planned to use AES 128 to encrypt and decrypt the data between these two endpoints. 
First the sensitive data is encrypted using Object-C's CommonCrypto framework, and then the data is decrypted inside a Java Server (Servlet).
I'm new to security protocols and standards, and basically my code is a subset of group of informations that I could gather on Apple's dev forum/resources, and the internet (Google) :-)
The basic flow is:

The data is encrypted using AES (using a pre-set key).
The encrypted bytes are putted within the XML (using base64)
The data is gathered from the XML, and decrypted using the same pre-setted key;

The encryption part of the Object-C code is:
char keyPtr [ kCCKeySizeAES128 +1 ];
bzero( keyPtr, sizeof(keyPtr) );

// The secret key is masked for obvious reason, but you can use ""12345678912345678912345678912345""

"40975510","Spring boot and JCA providers","I have a Spring boot(1.4.2.RELEASE) project with bouncycastle as a dependency in the pom.xml as in the following:

<dependency>

...

However, when I attempt to specify ""BC"" as the provider for a JCA operation in my code, such as:
Signature aSig = Signature.getInstance(""SHA256withRSA"",""BC"");
I get the standard no such provider exception:
java.security.NoSuchProviderException: no such provider: BC 
despite having the entry 
security.provider.1=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider
in my jre's java.security file.  
With this dependency in my pom file, the built jar has the bouncy castle jars in the BOOT-INF/lib folder:

I can access the classes within them with no issue but JCA can't find the provider.
So, does JCA require the provider jars to be in jre/lib/ext? 
...or am I simply missing something?
EDIT:
However, this:

works.

However, Java policy limits the length of DES keys to 56 bits, so maximum key length for 3DES is 168 bits.

","Yes, a file that begins with the line ""-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----"" is a PEM format PKCS#8 encrypted private key. I don't know why your comment says ""OpenSSL does not recognize it""; the fact that openssl rsa reads it successfullly proves OpenSSL does recognize it.
BC PKCSException is just a wrapper; your actual problem is java.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size. This occurs if you try to use better than 128-bit symmetric encryption or (as here) decryption in a JRE that has the default shipped-by-Sun-now-Oracle crypto policy which is limited to 128-bit symmetric.

","
I'm trying to sign and validate signature in RSA+SHA1 with PKCS1 v2.0 padding.

This is a strange requirement.
First of all, RSA is secure even if PKCS#1 v1.5 compatible padding is used. It is however not secure when SHA-1 is used to hash the input/message, for the simple reasons that SHA-1 is not considered secure anymore for that kind of purpose.
Second, although PKCS#1 v2.0 contains a new padding mode for signature generation called PSS or - to be more precise - RSASSA-PSS it also contains the single signature generation mode from 1.5 of the standard called RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5. So at least in theory your requirements are not clear.

Now PKCS#1 v1.5 padding for encryption is known to be broken against padding oracle attacks. For that reason alone, OAEP encryption introduced in PKCS#1 v2.0 is generally available.
PSS for signature generation has a better security proof, but PKCS#1 v1.5 is still considered secure. This is likely why Oracle / SUN didn't include PSS within Java SE JCA. If you want it you can vote for it here.


I haven't found in the documentation (JDK or JCE) which algorithm/padding I have to use. It seems that I've to use OAEP padding but I didn't succeed.

OAEP stands for Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding. Padding for encryption cannot/should not be used for signature generation.

After adding the Bouncy Castle provider the RSA PSS becomes available. You can use your (insecure) scheme with ""SHA1withRSA/PSS"" or indeed the identical ""SHA1withRSAandMGF1"". It's likely that Oracle's Java SE will support RSA/PSS once the TLS 1.3 specification is finalized.

","Hope I'm not too late to respond to this. Very recently I had to face the same issue with RSA encryption. My Signer wants to do the verification to the data that is sent through POST. This is how I managed to work on that in Java. 
Step 1 - Add following into your project
bcprov-ext-jdk14-1.45.jar 
commons-codec-1.4.jar

Step 2 - Declare your Cipher
private Cipher cipher;

Step 3 - Call below in your class constructor
Security.addProvider(new org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider());
this.cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/NONE/OAEPWithSHA1AndMGF1Padding"");

Step 4 - Get your PublicKey from public key text string
public PublicKey getPublic(String pubKey) throws Exception {
    byte[] publicBytes = Base64.decodeBase64(pubKey);
    X509EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(publicBytes);
    KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
    return keyFactory.generatePublic(keySpec);
}

Step 5 - Verification method
public boolean verfyRSA(String signature, String data, PublicKey key) throws Exception {

    byte[] sign = Base64.decodeBase64(signature);
    byte[] dat = Base64.decodeBase64(data);

    Signature rsaVerify = Signature.getInstance(""SHA1withRSAandMGF1"");
    rsaVerify.initVerify(key);
    rsaVerify.update(dat);
    return rsaVerify.verify(sign);
}

Step 6 - Usage
Yourclass yc = new YourClass();
PublicKey publicKey = yc.getPublic(""Your PublicKey without leading and trailing -------text------"");
boolean b = yc.verfyRSA(""POST_Signature"", ""POST_data"", publicKey);

Hope this helps. Mind the getInstance() parameters. These are the ones that do the trick. Cheers

I am using this tutorial/code as a starting point in building the applet - http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/3587361/Java-Applet-for-Signing-with-a-Smart-Card.htm
The biggest problem for me here seems to be the fact that the applet asks the user for location of the pkcs#11 implementation library. This is a big no-no for me because my typical user is not going to know the location of his pkcs#11 library.
From Oracle's Java documentation - http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html it seems that Java doesn't come with it's own implementation.
Is there a way to do this signing without asking the user for this location. I am OK with a solution which only works with just IE and Firefox on Windows.
With a few smartcards/cryptokens I have used, I have noticed that the moment I insert it, I can see the certificate in IE & Firefox's personal tab of certificates. This probably means that the crypto token registers all the certificates it contains with OS when you insert the card and deregisters it when you remove it. So it must probably be exposing some interface to the OS/Browser when it does it - can this not be used for signing?
","We did the thing you are trying to do now (distributed signing with client-side modules) within Distributed Cryptography add-on for our SecureBlackox product and we offer ActiveX control for IE and Java applet for other browsers. 
Unfortunately PKCS#11 DLLs are not registered anywhere so you can't avoid asking the user about location of this DLL. 
Most hardware devices support both PKCS#11 and CryptoAPI interfaces. Within CryptoAPI interface the CSP DLL exposes hardware-based certificates to CryptoAPI engine and thus to applications. In this case you can use Java classes that work with Windows CryptoAPI.
PKCS#11 is an interface, implemented by hardware vendors, so Java can't implement it's own - JVM is not a hardware and doesn't contain certificates (even if it did, that would not solve your problem). I need to notice, that Firefox has built-in PKCS#11 driver via which Firefox accesses its own certificates.  This was done for uniform support for software- and hardware-stored certificates.

","Smartcard or Token driver (PKCS#11) library has an additional layer called CSP (Crypto Service Provider) which acts like bridge between the device driver and OS Crypto services.  Token driver, once installed also adds this CSP and thus plunging the token or smartcard makes Certificates in it available (which acts as handle to private key stored securely on the crypto device).

I was also told that for Java 9, a JVM parameter -Dosgi.compatibility.bootdelegation=true can do the job (w/o the need to update MANIFEST.MF) but I don't have a Java 9 environment to verify it. Appreciate if someone can try it and let us know the result.

UPDATE 3
The class SealedObjectForKeyProtector.class is somehow different from the rest of the classes in the sunjce_provider.jar. When we try to decompile it with JD-GUI, it fails with internal error, unlike the rest of the classes:

","I meet this issue these days. And per my troubleshooting, it is caused by the different return value of this method:
sun.misc.VM.latestUserDefinedLoader()

Previously (before 8u171), this method returns sun.misc.Launcher$ExtClassLoader, while it returns application's classloader after upgrade. In ObjectInputStream, both class loader can load com.sun.crypto.provider.SealedObjectForKeyProtector successfully, that's simply because ExtClassLoader is the parent of application's class loader (or, parent's parent). However, once SealedObjectForKeyProtector is loaded by application's class loader, it's class loader no longer equals to ExtClassLoader.
On the other hand, within com.sun.crypto.provider.JceKeyStore, unlike ObjectInputStream, SealedObjectForKeyProtector is always loaded by ExtClassLoader. Thus below check in JceKeyStore.java:932 will fail due to class doesn't equal:
932            if (info.serialClass() != SealedObjectForKeyProtector.class))
934                return Status.REJECTED;

Then, we will get below log and an IOException eventually:
ObjectInputFilter REJECTED: class com.sun.crypto.provider.SealedObjectForKeyProtector
Solution: make sure class com.sun.crypto.provider.SealedObjectForKeyProtector is not loaded by ContextClassLoader by certain configuration. Details depend on the ContextClassLoader. For example, for org.powermock.core.classloader.MockClassLoader, the concrete solution is adding below annotation to involved test classes:
@PowerMockIgnore(""com.sun.*"")

","I have done a complete analysis about the issue and debugged through the code part that involves in JCEKS keystore. Whenever the application uses custom class loader then you will face the issue for sure, if using JCEKS keystore from older java versions than JDK 8 Update 151.
 private static class DeserializationChecker implements ObjectInputFilter {
    private static final int MAX_NESTED_DEPTH = 2;

    @Override
    public ObjectInputFilter.Status
        checkInput(ObjectInputFilter.FilterInfo info) {

        // First run a custom filter
        long nestedDepth = info.depth();
        if ((nestedDepth == 1 &&
                    info.serialClass() != SealedObjectForKeyProtector.class) ||
                (nestedDepth > MAX_NESTED_DEPTH &&
                    info.serialClass() != null &&
                    info.serialClass() != Object.class)) {
            return Status.REJECTED;
        }

        // Next run the default filter, if available
        ObjectInputFilter defaultFilter =
            ObjectInputFilter.Config.getSerialFilter();
        if (defaultFilter != null) {
            return defaultFilter.checkInput(info);
        }

        return Status.UNDECIDED;
    }
}

In the above code from JceKeyStore.class, the filter info will always be null, so   info.serialClass() != SealedObjectForKeyProtector.class check will fail. The class loading delegation doesnot happening as expected in case of custom class loader like Equinox - Eclipse plugin.
There is a two step solution

Firstly upgrade the keystore from JCEKS to PKCS12 as mentioned in the JDK 151 https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u151-relnotes-3850493.html  under  Notes: Better keystore handling topic. For most cases this will solve the issue. Further access the keystore with keystore type value PKCS12 after changes.
Make the classes from sun_jce provider get loaded earlier even before your custom class loaders scope. Use those configuration to make your custom class loader delegate the class loading of sun_jce jars to ExtClassLoader. For example : By using Eclipse-BuddyPolicy: ext  in the META-INF of eclipse plugin projects.

"6432179","Creating an SSL Connection in Java","I looked around and did not see any questions that fully answered what I wanted, though if this is a duplicate, point me to the question and I will be on my way.
Right now I am trying to write a Java server that will receive data from an SSLServerSocket and for now, just print it out. I would eventually like to have this data come from an Android, but right now it throws an SSLException before it even starts listening for data.
code:
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.keyStore"",""C:\\ProgramFiles\\jre6\\bin\\server.jks"");
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword"",""password"");
SSLServerSocketFactory factory = (SSLServerSocketFactory) SSLServerSocketFactory.getDefault();
ServerSocket ss = factory.createServerSocket(6543);
Socket s = ss.accept();

There is more code after that to process it, but it gets hung up and throws the exception there, so I'm not sure posting it will help any, but if it will, just comment for it. 
I created the certificate following a tutorial for openssl on Ubuntu and transferred it over and created my keystore using:
keytool -import -file ""C:\Documents and Settings\matt\Desktop\server.crt"" -keystore server.jks

I can easily admit that I don't fully understand how a large portion of this works, so any help would be appreciated. Also, I suppose I am going to leave it outside the scope of this question becauseI feel like this is a pretty big question on its own, butI would also like some insight as to how to connect the client if possible. Sorry for all the trouble and thanks ahead of time for all the help. 
EDIT:
the tutorial I followed is here:
http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html
Thanks again!
EDIT:
The Exception being throw is:
javax.net.ssl.SSLException: No available certificate or key corresponds to the SSL cipher suites which are enabled

I tried to Google the exception and most everything was a tutorial describing how to create a keystore (which I am under the impression that I already have). I will continue to sift through these search results. 
Thanks!
","When you create a keystore like this, you only put a certificate in your keystore:
keytool -import -file ""server.crt"" -keystore server.jks

What you need is to have a private key + a certificate.
Either you import them from somewhere else if you already have a certificate issued by a Certification Authority, or you can create a self-signed certificate if it's for limited use.
If the certificate you've created with OpenSSL is self-signed (or from a mini CA for your own use, e.g. with CA.pl), it's probably not worth the trouble of doing the conversion. You might as well generate a self-signed certificate directly with keytool. See the ""Generating Your Key Pair"" example in the official keytool documentation:

keytool -genkeypair -dname ""cn=Mark Jones, ou=JavaSoft, o=Sun, c=US""
     -alias business -keypass kpi135 -keystore /working/mykeystore
     -storepass ab987c -validity 180


Make sure you use cn=your.fqdn.host.name (or cn=localhost if it's for local tests only). (I think keytool provided with Java 7 also has support for subject alternative names, which would be better.)
If you already have a private key + certificate you want to re-use in PKCS#12 format (usually .p12 file), you can import it using the method described in this question.
If what you've produced with OpenSSL is in PEM format, it might be easier to bundle them in a PKCS#12 file with OpenSSL and then import them as above. This can be done with this:
openssl pkcs12 -export -in cert.pem -inkey key.pem -out creds.p12

","You are a bit short on information there...
There are several signature schemes which use elliptic curves, but the most widespread (by far) is ECDSA. You must then worry about the following points:

Signature operates on a sequence of bits. Every single data bit must be correct. Here, you have ""values"" so there must be an encoding of those values into a sequence of bits (or bytes). To verify the signature, you must use the same encoding than the one used to generate the signature.
ECDSA begins by hashing the input data with a cryptographic hash function. There again, you must use the same one than what was used for generating the signature. As a wild guess, I would say that the hash function is probably SHA-1.
ECDSA operates in an elliptic curve. The curve size is not enough to define the curve: there are many 192-bit curves. However, since defining your own curve is hard, most people use one curve among the 15 curves defined in FIPS 186-3. One of those 15 curves has a ""192-bit size"" (it is called ""P-192"") so chances are that the signature uses that curve.
An ECDSA public key is the encoding of a curve point. A curve point is, nominally, a pair of integers (X, Y) (these are the ""coordinates"" of the point). These integers are from the base field in which the curve lives; for the P-192 curve, the coordinates are 192-bit integers. The ""normal"" encoding for such a public key is then a 49-byte string: the first byte will be 0x02, followed by the big-endian unsigned encoding of X (24 bytes), then the unsigned encoding of Y (24 bytes). Other encodings are possible.
An ECDSA signature formally consists in two integer values, usually called r and s (192-bit integers too). There again, the signature you have is probably a sequence of bytes which is an encoding of the two integers. There are two common encodings, one being a raw big-endian unsigned encoding of both value (hence a 48-byte signature), the other using ASN.1 (for a signature of length 53 or 54  bytes, or so).

Using Bouncy Castle, as @Ashkan suggests, is a good idea. But, as you see, there are quite a lot of assumptions to do about your situation. If you want to gain a thorough understanding of what is going on, buy a copy of ANSI X9.62:2005 (the ECDSA standard). Be warned that the mathematical contents are quite heavy.

Currently I have no idea how to generate a keypair and how to save it to a keystore. Also I've got some java code that can generate a key pair for GOST 34.10-2001 algorithm:
Security.addProvider(new org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider());

KeyPairGenerator kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""ECGOST3410"", ""BC"");
kpg.initialize(new ECGenParameterSpec(""GostR3410-2001-CryptoPro-A""));

KeyPair kp = kpg.generateKeyPair();

This code sample uses ECGenParameterSpec class to initialize a key pair generator, so may be I should provide it somehow to the keytool (-providerArg provider_arg or -Jjavaoption)?
P.S. I think that I should provide curve name as some parameter but I can not determine what parameter I should use.
","You will not be able to use keytool and BC to create a keystore with GOST3410 keys.
sun.security.x509.CertAndKeyGen class used by the keytool does not provide an option to initialize the key generator with parameters, while BC GOST3410 key generator requires the initialization with ECParameterSpec.
You can create the keypair+certificate and place them into the keystore programmatically:
Security.addProvider( new org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider() );

KeyPairGenerator keyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance( ""ECGOST3410"", ""BC"" );
keyPairGenerator.initialize( new ECGenParameterSpec( ""GostR3410-2001-CryptoPro-A"" ) );
KeyPair keyPair = keyPairGenerator.generateKeyPair();

org.bouncycastle.asn1.x500.X500Name subject = new org.bouncycastle.asn1.x500.X500Name( ""CN=Me"" );
org.bouncycastle.asn1.x500.X500Name issuer = subject; // self-signed
BigInteger serial = BigInteger.ONE; // serial number for self-signed does not matter a lot
Date notBefore = new Date();
Date notAfter = new Date( notBefore.getTime() + TimeUnit.DAYS.toMillis( 365 ) );

org.bouncycastle.cert.X509v3CertificateBuilder certificateBuilder = new org.bouncycastle.cert.jcajce.JcaX509v3CertificateBuilder(
        issuer, serial,
        notBefore, notAfter,
        subject, keyPair.getPublic()
);
org.bouncycastle.cert.X509CertificateHolder certificateHolder = certificateBuilder.build(
        new org.bouncycastle.operator.jcajce.JcaContentSignerBuilder( ""GOST3411withECGOST3410"" )
                .build( keyPair.getPrivate() )
);
org.bouncycastle.cert.jcajce.JcaX509CertificateConverter certificateConverter = new org.bouncycastle.cert.jcajce.JcaX509CertificateConverter();
X509Certificate certificate = certificateConverter.getCertificate( certificateHolder );

"50298687","Bouncy Castle vs Java default RSA with OAEP","Can someone explain to me why this code throws javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Decryption error on the final line when it's decrypting the key?
// Given an RSA key pair...
KeyPairGenerator keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"");
keyGen.initialize(2048);

PublicKey publicKey = keyPair.getPublic();

// ... and an AES key:

// When I encrypt the key with this Bouncy Castle cipher:
Cipher encryptionCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/NONE/OAEPWithSHA256AndMGF1Padding"", ""BC"");

decryptionCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, privateKey);
// ... throws `javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Decryption error` here:
decryptionCipher.doFinal(encryptedKey);

Is the following statement from https://stackoverflow.com/a/27886397/66722 also true for RSA with OAEP?

""RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding"" actually doesn't implement ECB mode encryption.
  It should have been called ""RSA/None/PKCS1Padding"" as it can only be
  used to encrypt a single block of plaintext (or, indeed a secret key).
  This is just a naming mistake of Sun/Oracle.

If so, I would expect these transformations to be equivalent and my test above to pass. The same padding has been specified in both, so why the BadPaddingException?
Either way, I would appreciate a layman's explanation of what the difference is.
","For similar Stackoverflow questions with more information please see Maarten Bodewes answers to this and this.
The ""mode"" part of the transformation string has no effect. The problem is different defaults used by different providers. This is unfortunate and very definitely suboptimal. Should we blame Sun/Oracle? I have no opinion beyond being dissatisfied with the result.
OAEP is a fairly complicated construction with two different hash functions as parameters. The Cipher transform string lets you specify one of these, which you have specified as SHA-256. However, the MGF1 function also is parameterized by a hash function which you cannot specify in the cipher transformation string. The Oracle provider defaults to SHA1 whereas the BouncyCastle provider defaults to SHA-256. So, in effect, there is a hidden parameter that is critical for interoperability.
The solution is to specify more fully what these hidden parameters are by supplying an OAEPParameterSpec to the Cipher.init(...) method as in the following example:
Cipher encryptionCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/NONE/OAEPWithSHA256AndMGF1Padding"", ""BC"");
OAEPParameterSpec oaepParameterSpec = new OAEPParameterSpec(""SHA-256"", ""MGF1"",
                MGF1ParameterSpec.SHA256, PSource.PSpecified.DEFAULT);
encryptionCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, publicKey, oaepParameterSpec);
// ...
// ...
// ...
Cipher decryptionCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/ECB/OAEPWITHSHA-256ANDMGF1PADDING"");
oaepParameterSpec = new OAEPParameterSpec(""SHA-256"", ""MGF1"",
                MGF1ParameterSpec.SHA256, PSource.PSpecified.DEFAULT);
decryptionCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, privateKey, oaepParameterSpec);

The first one is effectively a no-op, because those are already the defaults for Bouncycastle.

"30442771","Java JDK 7 SSL Issue","I'm facing a very strange issue and i'm blocked from several days on it
I have a WS client acting on SSL; with JDK 1.5 all orks good; upgrading to JDK 1.7 I'm having the error ""javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure""
So i debugged and I arrived to write a very simple and stupid Java main; in JDK 1.5 it works; in JDK 1.7 it doesn't.
By searching and reading Oracle documentation, in my JDK 1.7 environment i did the following steps:

installed the JDK 1.7 JCE extension downloaded from this URL: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html
imported the certificate by using the keytool command: keytool -importcert -file C:\certificato\mycert.spcoop.gov_25_05_15.der -alias prenotazioni  -keystore cacerts
added these JVM parameters: -Djavax.net.debug=all -Dhttps.protocols=""TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1,TLSv1,SSLv3""

This is my Java code:
SSLSocketFactory sslsocketfactory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
URL url = new URL(https_url);
HttpsURLConnection conn = (HttpsURLConnection)url.openConnection();
conn.setSSLSocketFactory(sslsocketfactory);
InputStream inputstream = conn.getInputStream();
InputStreamReader inputstreamreader = new InputStreamReader(inputstream);
BufferedReader bufferedreader = new BufferedReader(inputstreamreader);
String string = null;
while ((string = bufferedreader.readLine()) != null) {
System.out.println(""Received "" + string);
}

When I execute my code, in JDK 5 all works OK; in JDK 7 I have this error:
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure

I really don't want to ditch JSCH library due to it's rich feature,popularity and documentation and the server is out of our jurisdiction.

So is there a workaround anyone has figured out using JSCH library ???
","If you are using Java 8, then this might be caused by a bug in Java JCE that has recently been fixed. Upgrading to Java SE 8u45 (or higher) solves the issue.
I verified that with 1.8.0_45, jsch-0.1.53 is actually able to successfully negotiate an SSH session with a server that uses a 1536-bit DSA key.

","You are generating key data for a DiffieHellman key of 128 bytes with the statement:     byte[] bkey = ka.generateSecret();, but then use it as input for a AES keyspec with     new SecretKeySpec(bkey, ""AES""); 
This later trigger the exception you see when trying to initialize a cipher with cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, sk1); as an AES key is expected to have 16, 24 or 32 bytes (128, 192 or 256 bits) of key data and not 128 bytes.

java.security.*
javax.security.*

And on the other hand you have java.lang.SecurityManager, and possibly other security-related types sprinkled in other non-security packages (like java.lang).
So, several questions:

What is the difference between java.security and javax.security? When to use types in each?
Besides java.lang, are there any other packages where security-centric types appear, and if so, what are they?
Where do JCE and JCA fit in here? What packages do they comprise, or are they totally separate and in their own JARs?

Thanks in advance!
","The split has mainly historical reasons. Once upon a time there were export restrictions on cryptographic software in the US.
As a rule of thumb: Stuff related to signatures is found in java.security, the rest (ciphers, ...) in javax.security.
The JRE nowadays comes with the standard security provider bundled in, so JCE is part of the platform.

","Yes, make sure that your jQuery files are using jQuery.noConflict();. I had a similar problem in that another module's javascript was loaded before the JCE javascript & was causing a $ conflict scenario.

I have gone through this thread, and am able to run the program in Java 6. However, I need to run the same program in Java 5, and SecretKeyFactory for PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 is not available in JDK 5.
So, essentially, I need to generate 192 or 256 bits for a SecretKey based on users password, and I would like a secure way to do that in java 5.
Help appreciated!
EDIT #1
Just to avoid getting stuck, I am now using 128 bits from MD5(user-entered-password + fixed-salt) as the key to AES. I know it sucks, and will change it the moment I figure out a good way to generate the key.

"26282162","How to derive a key with JCA/JCE and with an HSM","I have a master key in an HSM and I want to derive it with a given diversifier.
I am quite new to JCA/JCE, and a bit lost with KeyGenerator, SecretKeyFactory, ... especially since all parameters are strings.
I want to use AES or HmacSha1.
It seems I need to use a SecretKeyFactory, and provide a KeySpecs.  But which type of KeySpecs?
(I have seen a post on that topic, but I didn't seem an HSM was used.)
Thanks.
","You can derive key using:

password-based derivation (PKCS#5) as described in Deriving a secret from a master key using JCE/JCA or
emulate C_Derive from PKCS#11 using encryption as described in PKCS11 deriveKey() and encrypt() returning different results for 3DES

to use HSM from JCA/JCE APIs, you need to add the corresponding provider to the JCA/JCE APIs and then specify the the provider parameter to request for that specific provider implementation.
For example:
int slot = 0;
Provider provider = new au.com.safenet.crypto.provider.SAFENETProvider(slot);
Security.addProvider(provider);
final String PROVIDER = provider.getName(); // ""SAFENET"", ""SAFENET.1"", ...

KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""DESede"", PROVIDER);
Key baseKey = keyGen.generateKey();

Cipher desCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""DESede/CBC/PKCS5Padding"", PROVIDER);
desCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, baseKey);

byte[] derived = desCipher.doFinal(""diversification data"".getBytes());

Note that if you need to do key derivation very often, you might consider to use your provider's PCKS#11 wrapper for Java (e.g. jcprov from SafeNet) or other APIs so that you can be more explicit about its session management and be more efficient about resource usage.

","Your example appears to use a 32-byte key and a 256 bit version of the AES cryptosystem. So, technically yes it is 256-bit AES encryption. The actual size of the message determines the resulting output but it should be larger then the original message. Also, you should be able to decrypt it and get the original message.

","MessageDigest sha = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");

The following code creates a Hash of the input that is key. If we have some data ""x"" and ""y"" unless x=y
hash of ""x"" will never equal to hash of ""y"", this can be used to determine if original data is tampered because if it is it will produce a different hash.
key = Arrays.copyOf(key, 32); // Use only first 256 bit
this.keyObj = new SecretKeySpec(key, ""AES"");

In this case you are getting 32 bytes of the digest you have created and forming a secret key that is of size 256 bit as 8x32=256 
you are then using the cipher along with this key for encryption and decryption.
most of the Cipher's operate in blocks (this one does). They partition the text to be encrypted into fixed block size which is equal to key size and then apply XOR etc operation on the block to get the encrypted block . If the text size does not align with cipher block size then extra padding is appended to the text to align it to the fixed block size.

"32306081","How to decrypt a private key in Java (without BC openssl)","Is it possible decrypt an encrypted RSA (or others, shouldn't matter) private keys using JCE and/or BouncyCastle provider (not using openssl bundle)?
I can read unencrypted keys just fine using PrivateKeyFactory.
Googling this gets me through examples of using PEMReader (from BC openssl bundle) that has a password applied to it, but - don't want to use openssl bundle, don't necessarily want to use PEM format, and I can decode PEM using PemReader (from provider bundle). It's what can I do with it afterwards is the question.
I'm looking for some mega-function, or a series thereof that can do it, i.e. I am not looking into parsing the ASN1 of the encrypted key, figuring out the encryption method, passing the input through the cipher, etc.
","If you have an encrypted PKCS#8 key in binary format (i.e. not in PEM format) the following code shows how to retrieve the private key:
public PrivateKey decryptKey(byte[] pkcs8Data, char[] password) throws Exception {
    PBEKeySpec pbeSpec = new PBEKeySpec(password);
    EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo pkinfo = new EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo(pkcs8Data);
    SecretKeyFactory skf = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(pkinfo.getAlgName());
    Key secret = skf.generateSecret(pbeSpec);
    PKCS8EncodedKeySpec keySpec = pkinfo.getKeySpec(secret);
    KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
    return kf.generatePrivate(keySpec);
}

If you have a PEM format, remove the header (first line), the footer(last line) et convert the remaining content from base64 to regular byte array.

In the interest of keeping up with the latest, I have upgraded bouncycastle to 1.47 which seems to be largely different and I was wondering two things:
1) I can't seem to track down a concise list of examples. Due to the added verbosity of the code now necessary to accomplish similar things as before, this would be very welcome.
2) It seems unreasonably hard to work with bouncycastle while mixing in classic JCE stuff, at least much more so then before. Is there a reason for this?
As an example of the latter, take the generation of a csr, it used to be as simple as doing this:
org.bouncycastle.jce.PKCS10CertificationRequest request = new org.bouncycastle.jce.PKCS10CertificationRequest(type.toString(), subject, pair.getPublic(), null, pair.getPrivate());

Where subject is a ""javax.security.auth.x500.X500Principal"", the private & public key stem from a general ""java.security.KeyPair"" etc.
Now I have something like:
public byte[] generatePKCS10(KeyPair pair, SignatureType type, X500Principal subject) throws IOException {
    PKCS10CertificationRequestBuilder builder = new PKCS10CertificationRequestBuilder(
        new X500Name(subject.getName()),
        SubjectPublicKeyInfo.getInstance(pair.getPublic())
    );
    AlgorithmIdentifier sigAlgId = new DefaultSignatureAlgorithmIdentifierFinder().find(type.toString());
    AlgorithmIdentifier digAlgId = new DefaultDigestAlgorithmIdentifierFinder().find(sigAlgId);
    AsymmetricKeyParameter keyParam = PrivateKeyFactory.createKey(pair.getPrivate().getEncoded());
    try {
        ContentSigner signer = new BcRSAContentSignerBuilder(sigAlgId, digAlgId).build(keyParam);
        PKCS10CertificationRequest csr = builder.build(signer);
        ContentVerifierProvider verifier = new JcaContentVerifierProviderBuilder().setProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider()).build(pair.getPublic());
        csr.isSignatureValid(verifier);
        return csr.getEncoded();
    }
    catch (OperatorCreationException e) {
        throw new IOException(e);
    }
    catch (PKCSException e) {
        throw new IOException(e);
    }
}

Is there a whole host of easy conversion utilities or overloaded methods or JCE-specific implementations that I'm missing? It does not help that a lot of google-searches highlight old (read: deprecated) ways of doing things.
","I stumbled upon a JCE-compliant solution shortly after posting this. It seems quite a few of their classes have a JCA-specific extension which handles all the necessary conversion. For example ""X509v1CertificateBuilder"" can be instantiated as ""new JcaX509v1CertificateBuilder()"" which takes JCE parameters instead of bouncycastle-specific ones. 
For the example above:
PKCS10CertificationRequestBuilder builder = new JcaPKCS10CertificationRequestBuilder(
    subject,
    pair.getPublic()
);

I hope this pattern holds...

","Despite the name, most re-implementations are done in rooms with mostly empty beer cans and pizza boxes. This is speaking from past experience, you understand :-)
However, in the context of chip development, a clean room is one where small imperfections (like dust) can cause serious problems at the nano scale. So they're kept incredibly clean, with air scrubbers, protective suits (protecting the environment, notvthe wearer) etc. 
By analogy, software clean room development is done without any access to imperfections that could cause problems. In the case of open-source software, this means not having access to an implementation that might be ""tainted"" by an incompatible license.

","com.sun.crypto.provider is the Sun Java Cryptography Extension (JCE), introduced for Java 1.3 (I think) to get around the lunatic export regs of the US government.

","What you are seeing on the console is the result of the toString() method of byte[]. It doesn't represent the actual contents. Instead it is an ID for the object. They are different because you have different objects.
Also if you use String.valueOf(encrypted) it will fall back to the valueOf(Object) method because there is no valueOf(byte[]). This gives you not a string representation of the contents of your array, but the same object ID produced by toString().
Use e.g. new String(encrypted) to convert the contents of the byte array to a readable string.

","Why isn't it possible to just add the necessary policy files?
That would be the easiest thing to do.
If you live in the US and you export your software to other (maybe ""unallowed"") countries, you will (theoretically) get trouble either way (including policy files/doing the encryption yourself). 
If you live outside the US, why even bother about it, just include the policy files, no one cares.

","Use the Bouncycastle lightweight crypto API directly, rather than through Java JCE interface. Bouncycastle includes its own crypto API accessible through various classes in org.bouncycastle.* packages. It also implements the JCE provider interface to make some of its crypto implementations available through standard JCE classes like Cipher, KeyGenerator, etc.
The cryptography policy restrictions are enforced by the JCE classes, not by bouncycastle. Therefore if you do not use these classes you'll will not encounter any restrictions. On the downside you will sacrifice some portability. To get started, take a look at the javadocs for the AESEngine class, and the rest of the javadocs for the bouncycastle.

It works through the client sending the encrypted message to the server where it is sent back and decrypted. Unfortunately, whenever I decrypt the message, I get the error as follows: javax.crypto.IllegalBlockSizeException: Input length must be multiple of 16 when decrypting with padded cipher. The encryption is based of this program :(http://www.scottjjohnson.com/blog/AesWithCbcExample.java) which works perfectly fine and I cannot see the difference between my code and that one except for that I must convert from string to byte array. Here is my code code:
Client (Encryption):
String message = textField.getText();
// generate a key
KeyGenerator keygen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""AES"");
keygen.init(128);  // To use 256 bit keys, you need the ""unlimited strength"" encryption policy files from Sun.
byte[] key = keygen.generateKey().getEncoded();
SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(key, ""AES"");

// build the initialization vector.  This example is all zeros, but it 
// could be any value or generated using a random number generator.
byte[] iv = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
IvParameterSpec ivspec = new IvParameterSpec(iv);

// initialize the cipher for encrypt mode
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, skeySpec, ivspec);

// encrypt the message
byte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(message.getBytes());
System.out.println(""Ciphertext: "" + encrypted + ""\n"");
System.out.println(encrypted);
out.println(encrypted);
textField.setText(""""); 

Server Side:
String input = in.readLine();
writer.println(""MESSAGE "" + input);

Client (Decryption):
//DECRYPTION
System.out.println(line);
line = line.substring(8);
System.out.println(line);

// generate a key
KeyGenerator keygen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""AES"");
keygen.init(128);  // To use 256 bit keys, you need the ""unlimited strength"" encryption policy files from Sun.

// reinitialize the cipher for decryption
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");
cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, skeySpec, ivspec);

","Your problem has nothing to do with cryptography. You are failing to transfer your data correctly between your clients and the server.
I'm fairly sure out.println(encrypted) is not what you want to be doing, although I'm not entirely clear since I don't know the type of out. Nor should you be calling line.getBytes() in your decryption code.
You should convert your ciphertext to a non-lossy string form, such as hexadecimal or base64. So, try:
out.println(DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(encrypted));

and
byte[] decrypted = cipher.doFinal(DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary(line));

","No.  You can't encrypt entire folders with only Java's JCE library.  It's not hard to zip it first though using a stream wrapper like ZipInputStream and ZipOutputStream.  Since you don't care about file size reduction, you could also use jtar.  That will make it easy to tar up the folder after which it can be encrypted with JCE like any other file.
I would make a class called something like public class FolderEncrypter with methods public byte[] encryptFolder(File folder) and public File decryptFolder(public byte[]).  Then it is easy to reuse throughout your code whenever you need it.

Which one should I put into my search path to execute Java-based

According to the ""JDK and JRE File Structure"" document, you should add jdk1.7.0\bin to the path:

c:\jdk1.7.0\bin
      Executable files for the development tools contained in the Java Development Kit. The PATH environment variable should contain an entry
  for this directory. For more information on the tools, see the JDK
  Tools.



Do I need to put the Unlimited JCE Policy files just into the security
  sub-directory of the corresponding JRE in my search path or also into
  all others in order to work correctly?

According to the ""Unlimited Strength Java(TM) Cryptography Extension Policy Files"" documentation you will need to install the unlimited strength policy JAR files for all JREs that you plan to use.:

On Windows, for each JDK installation, there may be additional
      JREs installed under the ""Program Files"" directory. Please make
      sure that you install the unlimited strength policy JAR files
      for all JREs that you plan to use.

","I haven't worked with CAC cards, but PKI integration is typically handled by PKCS#11 middleware installed on the client CPU. On the server, you may need to intercept the request at the apache module level to enable PKI/SSO, here's a slideshow with more info on how they did it for forge.mil:

If you need to do other web based interactions with the card (non PKCS11 functions like if you want to talk to one of the other apps installed on the card from your web app, or install an applet on the card) you'll need some kind of browser plug-in to send raw APDUs or higher level commands via PCSC.

Prior to JDK 1.4, the JCE was an unbundled product, and as such, the JCA and JCE were

","You first should know what you are trying to do before doing it:

RSA without padding is completely insecure;
you use a key for Password Based Encryption which only makes sense with - well - a password;
you come out with a DES key, which again is completely insecure;
you probably generate it with a salt, which is random, so the output is random.

The whole protocol doesn't make sense. That you're trying to encrypt directly with DH (a scheme to perform key agreement) shows that you haven't studied crypto enough.
With cryptography it's not about getting things to work. It's about getting things secure. You cannot do that by just trying things out. Learn at least the basics of cryptography then code.

The RSA algorithm is the only one I have gotten to work with my keys. If I specify the DiffieHellman alg. for the keypair, I am unable to encrypt/ decrypt at all. If anyone has any insight into what I have done wrong, any help would be greatly appreciated. When I call this in its current state, I start with a secretkey of this value = cGFzczEyMw== and end with a key of this value after encryption/ decryption

","RC4 is a stream cipher, so it can decode any amount of data. Your issue is that InputStreams are not read in massive chunks. Normally you loop around the read call until there is no more data left to read and use a small buffer. See the documentation of read().
This could be implemented as
while(true) {
    int numRead = cipherInputStream.read(byteBuffer);
    if(numRead == -1)
        break;
    outputStream.write(byteBuffer, 0, numRead);

","@Michael Lowman has the correct answer, but I'd thought I'd show another way just to advertise a feature of the DataInputStream class.
You can the read-it-all-in-one-go behavior, like a perl slurp, by using the DataInputStream.readFully() method. In your example, you can read in the bytes with this method, then write them out and decrypt by using as CipherOutputStream instead of a CipherInputStream.
Consider the following fragment as an example:
    byte[] byteBuffer = new byte[(int) inputFile.length()];
    DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(inputStream);
    dis.readFully(byteBuffer);
    dis.close();
    CipherOutputStream cos = new CipherOutputStream(outputStream, cipher);
    cos.write(byteBuffer);
    cos.close();

When I export it however, it only works when I run the JAR file from command line. I have done some debugging and when I double click the executable/runnable JAR it falls in the encryption/decryption methods as they throw Exceptions.

","Ok, so it looks like the only way to distribute the unlimited JCE policy is to unpack the required .jars and overwrite the existing ones on users' computers, either during installation or upon first run of the application. But even that appears to be a hit or miss process.
The alternative route that a lot of people seem to be taking is using APIs such as BouncyCastle which supports higher levels of encryption and can be freely and easily distributed, even with commercial applications.
I imagine that Oracle made it this way because of restrictions previously imposed of certain countries that now seem to have been lifted. I might be wrong, but I have nevertheless heard that Java is working on a better implementation to solve this problem!

What is the proper random algorithm to be used here to initialize a  KeyPairGenerator?
Like SHA1PRNG when we use SHA256WithRSAEncryption 
I mean: SHA256WithRSAEncryption is a key pair algorithm, while SHA1PRNG is a random generator to be used by the keypair algorithm. E.g. keyPairGenerator.initialize(keySize, secureRandom);
(where keyPairGenerator is of class KeyPairGenerator)
Are they somehow depend on proper pairing?I.e. can I use MD5WithRSAEncryption with SHA1PRNG?
","The hash algorithm, if any, underlying the deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) doesn't matter. 
The output of a DRBG is statistically random; if your were able to determine anything about the source of the bits by examining the output, it wouldn't be suitable for cryptographic use.
By the way, the RSA signature algorithm uses a RNG when using the RSA-PSS scheme. Older RSA signatures are deterministic (and this is a weakness).
What does matter is the effective strength of an algorithm. For example, you wouldn't want to use SHA-1 with a 3072-bit RSA signature key; the hash not as strong as the encryption algorithm using that key. DRBGs can be classified by their strength as well. The security strength of a DRBG indicates how much computation is needed predict its output without being given its internal state.
The security strength of a good hash-based DRBG is the same as that of the underlying hash function. To find this out, look at NIST SP 800‑57 Part 1, Table 3. For strong security, 112 bits is the minimum, with 128 bits or more being encouraged. That means using a DRBG based on SHA-224 or SHA-256, with a 2048- or 3072-bit RSA key, respectively.

What is the proper random algorithm to be used here to initialize a  KeyPairGenerator?
Like SHA1PRNG when we use SHA256WithRSAEncryption 
I mean: SHA256WithRSAEncryption is a key pair algorithm, while SHA1PRNG is a random generator to be used by the keypair algorithm. E.g. keyPairGenerator.initialize(keySize, secureRandom);
(where keyPairGenerator is of class KeyPairGenerator)
Are they somehow depend on proper pairing?I.e. can I use MD5WithRSAEncryption with SHA1PRNG?
","The only issue with SHA1PRNG is that the keyspace is for some reason limited to 20 bytes.  This is totally unnecessary since the hash can be performed on a virtually unlimited amount of text.  It is not clear to me why there is a limit on the keysize for this generator.  The good news it is easy to copy the source code and remove that limitation. The bad news is that it is then not compatible with the standard implementation.

Obviously I want to make one small jar with only the required stuff.
Obviously the Java way of doing that involves having a huge sacred signed Bouncy Castle JCE jar around.
The question is: What's the easiest way of getting S/MIME without touching JCE and having it complain about ""authenticating"" ""providers""? Maybe there is a S/MIME implementation that doesn't depend on JCE? Maybe it is possible to use Bouncy Castle S/MIME using their lightweight API without touching JCE? Maybe there is any other way?
It is obvious to me that nothing can prevent a pure-java open source crypto algorithms from working regardless of whether Sun approves, so it's not a question of theoretical possibility, rather: which way is the least painful?
Of course, I can always go ugly early by grabbing Bouncy Castle pure-java JCE implementation, renaming its packages to java.security1, and making any changes I want - but this way looks too painful right now.
UPDATE My current problem with using Bouncy Castle directly: I try to load keys from keystore, which involves using SecretKeyFactory, which in turn rejects my Bouncy Castle build.
","BC S/MIME is written over the CMS package, so the question really devolves to modifying the CMS package so all the crypto is done using the light-weight classes.
Something similar has been done already, more-or-less successfully, for the .NET version of Bouncy Castle. We're trying (admittedly it's a slow process) to refactor the Java version so the CMS stuff can work with either JCE or lightweight. The same issue affects other parts of the BC API too e.g. the PKCS#12 keystore is built into the JCE provider, the OpenPGP package is written to JCE, etc. The .NET ports of these rewrote them to the light-weight API also.
Your problem is probably simpler than the general case though. Presumably you only need the CMSSignedDataGenerator and supporting classes. You probably don't need all the myriad variations of addSigner or generate. If you just decide on your digest/signature algorithms up front, then all the provider stuff will be easy to replace with hardcoded calls to specific lightweight implementations.
Instead of a keystore, maybe you could get away with just storing a single private key in a PKCS#8 file (PEM encoded perhaps). Similarly for the certificate.

","This is a security feature that prevents un-trusted code from removing a Sun provider. There is a way to do it which involves having proper permissions to do so. If you go to this link http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html and scroll down to the title heading The Security Class you can read up on how to remove a provider and what will happen.
EDIT
Excerpts from the docs which go over that installed providers that are not extensions may requite a policy file to perform certain actions such as adding and removing a provider. Worth a try.

The documentation from the vendor of each provider you will be using should include information as to which permissions it requires, and how to grant such permissions. For example, the following permissions may be needed by a provider if it is not an installed extension and a security manager is installed

-

The Security class manages installed providers and security-wide properties. It only contains static methods and is never instantiated. The methods for adding or removing providers, and for setting Security properties, can only be executed by a trusted program. Currently, a ""trusted program"" is either

a local application not running under a security manager, or
an applet or application with permission to execute the specified method (see below).

The determination that code is considered trusted to perform an attempted action (such as adding a provider) requires that the applet is granted the proper permission(s) for that particular action.

-

Each ""grant"" statement in such a file grants a specified code source a set of permissions, specifying which actions are allowed.
Here is a sample policy configuration file:
grant codeBase ""file:/home/sysadmin/"", signedBy ""sysadmin"" {
    permission java.security.SecurityPermission ""insertProvider.*"";
    permission java.security.SecurityPermission ""removeProvider.*"";
    permission java.security.SecurityPermission ""putProviderProperty.*"";

"11208380","Why MD5 is required for JCE initialization","I am experimenting on enabling FIPS 180-3 on my java application. FIPS 180-3 allows only usage of 5 secure [hashes] (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-3/fips180-3_final.pdf) , MD5 is not one among them. Hence i am trying to programatically remove MD5 algorithms from the Sun provider. This is the sample code.

public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Security.removeProvider(""SUN"");
    Sun sun = new Sun();
    sun.remove(""MessageDigest.MD5""); //Comment and it will work !!!
    Security.addProvider(sun);
    Cipher ciph = Cipher.getInstance(""AES"");                
}   


But this is throwing the following exception. If you comment ""sun.remove(.."" the program works fine. If i remove MD2, instead of MD5 then also it works fine.
To me it looks like the jre libs are using MD5 for their signing, but i checked jre/lib/ext/sunjce_provider.jar signer and its using sha1.
Any idea why my code is failing with this error?

","So my inference from this exercise is that since jce itself needs MD5 to verify its classes for signing purposes, we cannot remove MD5 algorithm from jre and hence jre 1.6 itself cannot be made FIPS 180-3 complaint.
c# in FIPS cannot load MD5. Refer Is there an alternate hashing algorithm to MD5 for FIPS-enabled systems?. With the above test i guess java cant do that behavior.
Do let me know if anyone objects to by observation or any obvious mistakes i might have overlooked.

Thank you in advance for any help you can provide.
","This is not so much a solution but a workaround. Due to cleaning the headers before displaying the page, the code generated by JCE is lost. By adding the following code to the page called by ajax, I am able to trigger the JCE initializer and display the editor correctly.
$document =& JFactory::getDocument();
echo ""<script type='text/javascript'>
function loadJCE() {"";
echo $document->_script[""text/javascript""];
echo ""}
</script>"";

Then I just called loadJCE from the load complete function.
Again, this is not the best way to do it but it did the trick for me.

","Don't do this:

You're using the platform default encoding all over the place in your code. Don't do this. It will lose data.
When you're converting genuine text to bytes (e.g. on encryption) use a specific charset - UTF-8 is a good choice. Use the same charset to decode from ""encoded text"" to String.
When you're converting arbitrary binary data to text, use base64 encoding, e.g. via this public domain Base64 encoding library.
Basically, when you create a new string with the String(byte[]) or String(byte[], String) constructors, you're saying, ""This is genuine text data - please just decode it as a string."" When the data is actually the result of encryption, it's not text data... it's an arbitrary bunch of bytes.

This applet contains custom cryptoprovider implementation and some additional helper jars. It must be able to work with local files and USB-devices.
Java complains that it doesn't know this certificate. Root certificate seems to be legitimate certificate from Sun used for code signing and java should know it, but it doesn't for some reason.
What should I do, so java won't complain about this applet? Should I extract this root certificate JCE Code Signing CA and install it into $JRE/lib/security/cacerts?
","It is good question. This certificate is selfsigned and not officialy in Java tursted CA (cacerts). I've found that cryptographic extensions works even if that certificate is expired (doesn't work without signing). So I suppose that JCE requires cryptoproviders to be signed with ""JCE Code Signing CA"" but doesn't care about validity of that certificate (maybe it is checked internally by JCE without cacerts). I also understand that it is not the case here. The problem is with javaws (JNLP distribution) which requires jars to be signed with trusted chain. Also it is stressed by Oracle about JCE Code Signing certs that ""the certificate will not work for deployment purposes"" (see: here). But what if it have to exist in distribution? As I said: good question.
EDIT:
Conclusions:
1. Cryptoproviders have to be signed with ""JCE Code Signing CA"" not necessary valid.
2. If you distribute jar signed with ""JCE Code Signing CA"" then certificate has to be valid. JCE sign is not enough to distribute but if exists it has to be valid.

","How is the verification code downloaded to the client?  More details about the application in question?  If it's a verification script downloaded via HTTP then the scheme is fundamentally broken.  You probably need to use SSL, especially if you already argued as such.
Without knowing more about your system, it sounds like an adversary in a man-in-the-middle attack need only to:

Replace the public key in the verification code with their own.
Resign all ""secure"" communications with their own signature.
Your script sees nothing wrong because the public key it checks was modified by the adversary.

Not to mention all communication is in plain-text (so hopefully no personal/sensitive information being transmitted?)
SSL works around this problem because all the certificates have to be signed by a root certificate authority trusted by / installed with the web browser.  CAs are supposed to only issue certificates for domains to people that control/own them; therefore, the previous attack would not work.
Now, if your client is installed in a trusted fashion such that an adversary cannot tamper with it, then you can continue with your scheme and still be secure.  For example, if the client is installed on a client PC by hand, or delivered securely some other way (like via SSL, and/or using code signing).

","This issue is due to a NAESB-EDI standard. Where a file has been submitted in an http request and we are required to produce a particular response.  We are using SSL and the original payload is supposed to be encrypted. The response is plain html (of 4 items) with an additional digital signature of the response. What I have figured to do is to create the response, have existing pgp software create the signature based upon the generated response and then append the signature to the response. Thus I am not using MD5 anymore and I am not exposing keys to public use (except to those that we specifically trade). So James answer is partially correct and without SSL, this offers little if any protection against sniffing since the response is clear text. Yet without the required information in the request, they would not even get a proper response. Likely wouldnt get a response (let alone a proper one).

","The issue appears to be
at java.io.Os400FileSystem.list(Native method)
at java.io.File.list(File.java:922)

The Mac.getInstance() code needs to read a folder (File.list) which is being done by the Os400FileSystem.list() method.  Apparently that folder is too large.
The first thing you need to check is that the machine is current on PTF's.   If the problem remains, then try giving your process more memory (argument to the JAVA/RUNJVA command) to see if you just have a bit too little memory.  The defaults were incremented from V5R3 to V5R4.

","Current Android versions  include a shortened version of Bouncycastle and there is no full support for Elliptic Curve Cryptography.

","I have received an answer from the GoogleGroup dedicated to Conscrypt. The Conscrypt documentation was lacking some instructions about how to use it on Android (this is fixed now). On Android, App/build.gradle should contain:
compile 'org.conscrypt:conscrypt-android:1.1.4'

I had a ""java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError"" because I was using:
compile 'org.conscrypt:conscrypt-openjdk:1.1.3:'

This is wrong because this line is for OpenJDK.
On more thing: I have been told that Conscrypt on Android works as far back as API level 9 (Gingerbread).

","The exception mentions:

This answer only tries to fix that issue. I've written another answer to help the following issue, since these are totally different.
If you live in a country that does allow it, you can go and download it from Oracle's website.
Then, to install these unlimited strength packages, go into your $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/ folder (assuming you have a JDK).
There, backup your local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar.
Now unzip the local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar files from the zip file you downloaded into that folder, and restart your application. Your application now have access to unlimited strength JCE capabilities.
If anything goes wrong, revert the two files to their backup versions.
Please note that each JVM that will have to run this code must be ""patched"" this way.

Any ideas why PBEWITHHMACSHA256ANDAES_256 is throwing EncryptionOperationNotPossibleException?
","Sorry to write another answer, but it seems we've progressed since the last answer. The problem is now slightly different, but enough to deserve another answer.
As you say, you ""only"" get an empty exception message now.
The problem seems to reside with the algorithm: using PBEWITHHMACSHA256ANDAES_256 always throws an exception.
This is because AES requires extra parameters, namely the IV. I found that IV are not supported by Jasypt.
If you want to go further with that specific algorithm, I suggest you implement it manually without Jasypt. An implementation is present in the above link.

","If you mean that you are literally using the identity operator (==) to test, then the assertion should always fail. Use alias.equals(""CN=CommonName, OU=..."") instead.
However, assuming that's not the problem, can add:
System.out.println(x509CertFact.getProvider());
System.out.println(alias);

at the appropriate points in the code and post the results? It might turn up more leads. Posting the certificate you are loading (in text-friendly PEM format) would be helpful too, if it isn't disclosing any personally-identifying information.

","Try using X500Principal#getName(String) to get the DN in the format of your choice.  Then you can parse the common name out of that.
Alternatively, if you're mapping an alias to an actual certificate you could store the ""alias"" in all caps (and query it in all caps) but you would still have the original casing from the mapped certificate

Which loads the key fine, but doesn't get me to a JCE PublicKey - just a byte[] getPublicKeyBlob() method.
Am I missing something obvious?
","I've found a way to do this using Bouncycastle (but would like to find a JCE way).
Adapting the code from Using public key from authorized_keys with Java security, and refering to RFC 5656, section 3.1, the following block added to decodePublicKey will parse the single BigInt value Q, which is ""the public key encoded from an elliptic curve point"":
if (type.startsWith(""ecdsa-sha2-"") &&
            (type.endsWith(""nistp256"") || type.endsWith(""nistp384"") || type.endsWith(""nistp521""))) {

        // Based on RFC 5656, section 3.1 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656#section-3.1)

        // The string [identifier] is the identifier of the elliptic curve
        // domain parameters.  The format of this string is specified in
        // Section 6.1 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656#section-6.1).
        // Information on the REQUIRED and RECOMMENDED sets of
        // elliptic curve domain parameters for use with this algorithm can be
        // found in Section 10 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656#section-10).
        String identifier = decodeType();
        if (!type.endsWith(identifier)) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Invalid identifier "" + identifier + "" for key type "" + type + ""."");
        }

        // Q is the public key encoded from an elliptic curve point into an
        // octet string as defined in Section 2.3.3 of [SEC1];
        // (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656#ref-SEC1)
        // point compression MAY be used.
        BigInteger q = decodeBigInt();

        ECPublicKey keyBC = getKeyBC(q, identifier);
        return keyBC;
    }

The solution I've found for getting from Q to an ECPublicKey is the following, using the Bouncycastle API (credit to Generate ECPublicKey from ECPrivateKey for providing the starting point):
ECPublicKey getKeyBC(BigInteger q, String identifier) {
    // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42639620/generate-ecpublickey-from-ecprivatekey
    try {
        // This only works with the Bouncycastle library:
        Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());
        // http://www.bouncycastle.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=362269#SupportedCurves(ECDSAandECGOST)-NIST(aliasesforSECcurves)
        String name = identifier.replace(""nist"", ""sec"") + ""r1"";
        KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""ECDSA"", ""BC"");
        ECNamedCurveParameterSpec ecSpec = ECNamedCurveTable.getParameterSpec(name);
        ECPoint point = ecSpec.getCurve().decodePoint(q.toByteArray());
        ECPublicKeySpec pubSpec = new ECPublicKeySpec(point, ecSpec);
        ECPublicKey publicKey = (ECPublicKey) keyFactory.generatePublic(pubSpec);
        return publicKey;
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException | InvalidKeySpecException | NoSuchProviderException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}

That gets you from an openssh format elliptic curve public key (ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b [256|384|521]) to a JCE ECPublicKey.

    while ((i = is.read(b)) != -1) {
        os.write(b, 0, i);
    }
}

","The first thing that catches my eye is this line:
aesCipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");
Assuming aesCipher is a variable of type Cipher, you are calling here the static Cipher.getInstance and throwing away the result (not assigning it to any variable). I.e. this line has no effect at all, aesCipher is the same as before this line.
If it was null before, then it still is null, and the next line (which calls a non-static method) will give you a NullPointerException. If your code is silently gobbling unknown exceptions (this might be outside the code shown), this is a general problem.
Other than this, I suppose that the flush on the CipherOutputStream does not really flush the whole buffer, but only as many blocks that can be written without adding any padding. Use close() instead of flush() here (which also seems to work in the second example).

A general remark: A small self-contained complete compilable example would have enabled me to try it and give you a definite answer, instead of only guessing. For example, ""does not return anything"" is not a good description for the behavior of your method - does the method return null, an empty array, throw an exception, block eternally?

For anyone having this problem as well, it turns out that my smart card doesn't support PKCS11 and I don't have appropriate PKCS11 dll.
","Well, I recently worked in a project which used to have Smart Card access for PKI Certificates and there we had the help from these two frameworks:

The Legion of BouncyCastle Java API (for PKI method abstractions) http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html
IAIK JCE PKCS11 Wrapper (for generic .dll smart card access) http://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/sic/Products/Core-Crypto-Toolkits/PKCS_11_Wrapper

I think that the second option shall be something that might help you too.

","I doubt about the question 

MessageDigest.getInstance(“MD5”) returning null

If the class MessageDigest you meant is java.security.MessageDigest, that method will NOT return null, even if you gave a not existing algorithm as parameter.
The code from jdk1.7
public static MessageDigest getInstance(String algorithm)
    throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        try {
            Object[] objs = Security.getImpl(algorithm, ""MessageDigest"",
                                             (String)null);
            if (objs[0] instanceof MessageDigest) {
                MessageDigest md = (MessageDigest)objs[0];
                md.provider = (Provider)objs[1];
                return md;
            } else {
                MessageDigest delegate =
                    new Delegate((MessageDigestSpi)objs[0], algorithm);
                delegate.provider = (Provider)objs[1];
                return delegate;
            }
        } catch(NoSuchProviderException e) {
            throw new NoSuchAlgorithmException(algorithm + "" not found"");
        }
    }

if it returned null, then md or delegate must be null, then NPE happened in this class.
so check and debug your codes step by step, find out which object is null.

No.  Or at least, not without understanding what the JCE error means.
If you showed us the error messages / stacktraces, maybe we could help you with that.

UPDATE
Those errors look like problems in your code rather than in JCE.

SSHA stands for Salted SHA.  SSH / SSHA are secure hash schemes, not an encryption schemes.  Moreover, you won't find a JCE provider for SSHA ... because it is really just a variation on SHA where you add a ""salt"" to the input that you are hashing.
The ""illegal key size"" exception looks like you are misusing one of the API methods.

If you showed us the code that throws the exceptions ... and the full stacktraces ... we could give you a more definite answer.  But I'm convinced that replacing the JCE JARs will make no difference.

","I know this is late, sorry for that - I have been researching how to do AES/CCM myself.
At any rate, the bouncycastle API supports CCM. It is pretty simple to add if you don't already have it as it is just a .jar file. You can head over to the java download page here to get the .jar. 
However, you can see your current security providers by running the below code: 
        Provider[] providers = Security.getProviders();
        for (int i = 0; i < providers.length; i++){
            Log.e(""Provider"", ""Name: "" + providers[i].getName() + "" Version: "" + providers[i].getVersion());
        }

I get the below output: 

After a quick search, and it's already pretty obvious, but ""BC Version: 1.52"" is Bouncy Castle.
I also found an example .pdf that says ""PKCS7Padding is often also referred to as PKCS5Padding."" I'm not using padding, so i'll have to let you do the research on that. You can find that article here. The quote is on page 17, but you can probably find it faster with a CTRL-F, then paste in PKCS5Padding. The examples are only of CBC and EBC though.
As a side note, you can see on this page that PKCS is supported.
I hope this helps!

it is occurring on line:
 Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA1"");

I tried next solutions:
 - NoSuchAlgorithmException: Algorithm HmacSHA1 not available - my local java.security file in actual state
 - https://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=316839
may be someone have any other ideas?
","fixed. problem was in my code, I have unusable:
System.setProperties(props);

where props - properites of config file

"25189382","JCE Editor toolbar icons do not load properly","I have a Joomla! 3.3.3  and I'm using the JCE Editor. My problem is that the editor is not showing the icons of the buttons on the toolbar. Using Firebug, I realized it was a problem in the path of the css of all themes.


In this case, I'm using Classic. The css that appears in of the Firebug code is:
.classicSkin .mceIcon {
   background: url(""/campusbaixada/web/sites/dev01.unifesp.br/components/com_jce/editor/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/img/icons.gif"") in the repeat scroll 20px 20px RGBA (0, 0, 0, 0);
}

If I change to:
.classicSkin .mceIcon {
   background: url (""/ components / com_jce / editor / tiny_mce / themes / advanced / img / icons.gif"") no-repeat scroll 20px 20px rgba (0, 0, 0, 0);
}

part of the toolbar will reappear.
So I'm going in of the JCE folder on the server (components / com_jce / editor / tiny_mce / themes / advanced / skins / classic) and change the code for the
.classicSkin .mceIcon {
   background: url (img ../../ / icons.gif) no-repeat 20px 20px;
}

for
.classicSkin .mceIcon {background: url (/components/com_jce/editor/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/img/icons.gif) no-repeat 20px 20px;}

Now my questions:
I tried to leave it fixed at a default css file of my template cuz every time I update the component, it loses my settings, but could not make it work. On their forum besides not having this problem, I have to pay to be able to post the doubts ... can anyone help me?
","The following workaround worked for me: Log into the Administrator.  Go to Components -> JCE Editor -> Global Configuration.  Set ""Compress CSS"" to No and click Save.

"8636558","Encrypting and decrypting a chunk of text in Java with JCA and JCE","I am trying to write a simple app in order to encrypt, and decrypt a chunk of text, using JCA and JCE from Java.
So far the encryption part works, but it gives me the following exception when decrypting :

javax.crypto.IllegalBlockSizeException: Input length must be multiple of 8 when decrypting with padded cipher


This is the part where I initialize the two Ciphers, encCipher, and decCipher.    
PBEKeySpec pbeKeySpec;
PBEParameterSpec paramSpec;
SecretKeyFactory keyFac;
byte[] salt = {(byte) 0xc7, (byte) 0x73, (byte) 0x21, (byte) 0x8c,
               (byte) 0x7e, (byte) 0xc8, (byte) 0xee, (byte) 0x99};
int count = 20;
paramSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);

try {
    pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(""my_password"".toCharArray(), salt, count);
    SecretKey secretKey = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBEWithMD5AndDES"").generateSecret(pbeKeySpec);

    encCipher = Cipher.getInstance(secretKey.getAlgorithm());
    encCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey, paramSpec);
    decCipher = Cipher.getInstance(secretKey.getAlgorithm());
    decCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey, paramSpec);

} catch (Exception ex) {
    ex.printStackTrace();
 }

I don't have experience with using the Java Cryptography Architecture, I would like to know how could I fix the error.
The exception happens at the line with decCipher.doFinal from loadClients.
private void saveClients() {
   String plainText = """";
   String encText = """";
   Set<String> clients = my_clients.keySet();
        try {
            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new File(output_file));
            for (String client : clients) {
                long client_time = my_clients.get(client);
                plainText = client + "" "" + client_time;

                encText = new String(encCipher.doFinal(plainText.getBytes()));
                out.println(encText);
            }
            out.close();
        } catch (Exception ex) {

","The problem comes from the fact that you transform bytes into Strings. Suppose that your default platform encoding is ASCII. This means that half of the bytes contained in your encrypted text (bytes 128 and above) don't represent valid characters. Moreover, you write one line for each encrypted text. So, if your encrypted byte array happens to contain a newline char, you will in fact write two lines to the writer, and try to decrypt each line one by one, which will lead to an exception.
Either use bytes to store and transfer your encryted data, or transform them into Strings using a non-lossy algorithm, like Base64 (which will make sure everything will be transformed into printable characters). Apache commons-codec has a Base64 implementation.

I know about DTLS, but it is problematic in Java. So I would much prefer to do my own encryption using JKS or JCE.
Why UDP? Some lost packets or reordering doesn't concern me, but latency does.
So far I have this concept:
The server creates a temporary symmetric encryption key (unique for the session), encrypts it with the public key of the client (asymmetric encryption) and sends it to the him. The rest of the session they communicate with datagrams encrypted using the symmetric key only.
What are the disadvantages of using this approach as opposed to DTLS? Speed? Security?
","The primary disadvantage is that you thought of it yourself. In general, one should never try to be ""clever"" or ""innovative"" in cryptography-related matters unless one is actually a cryptographer. Short of comprehensive experience regarding the tools, algorithms, and attack vectors, the best way to ensure cryptographic strength is to use well-tested, standardized tools. That means DTLS.
In this case, one problem seems to be susceptibility to MITM attacks, assuming the server does not already know the public key of all clients. Depending on the symmetric algorithm and the contents of the datagram, it might also be susceptible to known-plaintext attacks or chosen-ciphertext attacks. Again, these are things you should read about a little, get scared, realize that this is not what you want to be spending your time on, and go use DTLS.

What are the disadvantages of using this approach as opposed to DTLS? Speed? Security?
","That almost sounds like you are trying to re-invent DTLS. You are saying DTLS is problematic, but why is this?
In theory your logic is sound though. It reminds me of DTLS with RSA key exchange:

Client -> ClientHello (Share ClientRandom)
Server -> ServerHello (Share ServerRandom)
Server -> Certificate (Share certificate, containing server public key among other stuff)
Client -> KeyExchange (Share Pre-Master Secret encrypted with server public key)

Now both parties have: ClientRandom, ServerRandom which are public knowledge and Pre-Master Secret which has been shared over the network only with asymmetric encryption. Only the owner of the Certificate knows the private key required to decrypt Pre-Master Secret from the network communication so it is important that the Client verifies the Certificate the server sent.
DTLS determines the method for generating Master Secret from Pre-Master Secret, ClientRandom and ServerRandom and the symmetric encryption/MAC keys from the Master Secret. DTLS uses Pre-Master Secret instead of directly sharing the Master Secret for modularity. From security stand point it should be equally secure to share Master Secret directly. The ClientRandom and ServerRandom are technically used as salt in the key generation. This guarantees that both participants get a say in the cryptographic security of the salt.
Once the symmetric encryption keys are generated, the participants further verify that they can communicate using them before concluding the handshake.
When using CBC the encrypted packets themselves are in the form of:
[ IV ] + encrypted( [ Data blocks ] [ HMAC ] [ Padding ] )

Sending the Initialization vector with every packet adds some overhead to the transmission, but defends against some chosen plaintext attacks. However this is only one of the security measures against different attacks. There are a lot of different nuances in effective (D)TLS implementation: Ignoring or hiding error conditions, making sure operations take constant time even if they fail, etc.
So while the secure idea of DTLS can be summed up with ""Share public key to one participant. Transfer symmetric key with asymmetric encryption. Encrypt the communication with the symmetric key"", there's a lot more small details that makes it secure. It's these small details that usually fail when people invent their own security measures.
Effective MITM attacks are reduced by verifying the certificate - of course in the above handshake only the client verifies the server identity. If you need for the server to verify the client identity the client would need to send its own certificate as well, etc.

"40026788","nCipher HSM retarget JCE key","Is it possible to ""retarget"" keys generated via the ncipher JCE API to pkcs11? I know that you can retarget via the generatekey command but I don't see how to do it to an existing JCE key. The first prompt is for the ""source application"" and the options don't seem to include JCE. Does it support other options beyond the ones listed there or should I be looking at a different way of retargeting?
The ultimate goal here is to export a couple keys (asymmetric and symmetric) that were generated via nCipher's JCE API (yes, I know that an HSM's job is to secure the keys and exporting is usually not a good idea but it is a requirement here). We are able to export keys that were generated via the PKCS11 interface but not ones that were generated via the JCE so our thinking is that if we can retarget it from JCE to PKCS11 we might be able to export these keys as well. If there is another way to do this we are open to that as well.
Lastly, the JCE keys show up as ""recovery enabled"" when executing the nfkminfo on them. Does that mean that they are exportable or does recovery here mean something else?
","Disclaimer: I work for Thales e-Security but do not speak for the company.  
Yes you can retarget a jcecsp key to pkcs11.  If you have any jcecsp keys in your kmdata/local, /opt/nfast/bin/generatekey will offer jcecsp as a source option.  If you have no keys of that ilk, it will quietly omit that option from the source list.  However, this retarget process may not do what you think it does.  All retargeting does is change the application type and potentially the associated metadata: it doesn't change the fundamental capabilities of the key as those were baked into the protected key blob at generation time and cannot be changed. 
The Security World uses nShield key ACLs to limit the key's capabilities (Sign, Verify, Encrypt, Decrypt, Wrap, Be Wrapped, etc.).  PKCS#11 pulls its parameters (CKA_SIGN, etc.) directly from the key ACLs, and when generating keys through the API, the ACLs saved in the key blob are derived directly from the parameters in the key template.  If you set CKA_SENSITIVE to FALSE, and your Security World allows it, you can generate and save an exportable key. JCE is not that sophisticated: it has no concept of key capabilities at all, so the Provider has to guess at the user's intent with the key and it defaults to a fairly generous set.  However, since as you point out the whole idea of HSMs is to protect key bits and not let you have them, Export is not one of the defaults.  And what's not baked into the key file when you create it, you don't get by retargeting the key.  
One thing you could do if you want to use JCE is to generate the key using a different Provider and then store it in an nCipher.sworld KeyStore using the nCipherKM Provider: this will import the key into the Security World (if your World allows that) and save it as a key_jcecsp_* file.  However this has nothing to do with key security so from an HSM perspective it's not recommended. Another thing you could do is to drop down to the native nCore API, generate the key with the ACL entries you require, and then polymorph it to a JCE Key Object and save it in the HSM-backed KeyStore.  You can shoot yourself in the foot as many times as you want with the ACLs on the key you create.  The polymorphing is very poorly documented: ask Thales Support and they can guide you.  
Finally, the Recovery capability means that in addition to the Working Key blob which may be protected by an Operator Card Set, the key file has a Recovery Blob.  This is in case that Operator Card Set is lost: the Recovery Blob can be opened up by the Administrator Card Set of the Security World using the rocs utility (Replace Operator Card Set), which will write a new key file under a new OCS.  No, this does not mean the key is exportable.  It just means that you are protected against losing the OCS.  Of course losing the ACS is a non-starter as that is your Root of Trust.

But actually this is not what you wanted. To create an extra button for the P format you might try some Javascript to convert the Format select into a sequence of buttons.
In JCE 1.5 in the JCE Plugin Manager, there is a button ""New Plugin"". That helps with setting up new plugins. In JCE 2.0 you will need to create a complete installation package first.

fill_iv(iv); /* bytes 8 bytes of randomness into iv */
des_key_sched(&key1,ks1);

The C code takes two keys, JCE takes one. How do I reconcile this? Just append the two into one array? In which order?

","In answer to your last question, you'd find out by reading the documentation on the specific algorithms themselves. The Sun docs do generally assume you already are familiar with the subject matter. In this case, you would know that: triple DES is the application of three independently keyed DES ECB instances in sequence; that the most common way to this is something called DES ede, which means the 1st and 3rd DES instances are run in the encrypt direction but the 2nd DES instance is run in the decrypt direction; that ede3 three means that each DES instance is keyed independently and ede2 means that the 1st and 3rd instances use the same key; that OFB64 means 64-bit output feedback mode.
You should get the the same result with getInstance(""DESede/OFB64/NoPadding""), and by making the key1 the 1st 8 bytes of the DESede key, key2 the 2nd, and key1 the 3rd.

"42263476","what padding strategy is used by SunJCE SHA1WithRSA","Normally both PSS and PKCS1v15 can be used for RSA signatures padding.
And for java the code is also simple, but it just can't tell the padding strategy used.
My code:
Signature signature = Signature.getInstance(""SHA1WithRSA"");
signature.initSign(privateKey);
signature.update(plainBytes);
byte[] signBytes = signature.sign(); 

May I explicitly define PSS with MGF1 as the padding strategy using SunJCE as provider?  
","thanks @xuanzhui
Here is how I successfully verified my (hex encoded) signature:
public static boolean verify(String plainText, String signature, PublicKey publicKey) throws Exception {
    Signature publicSignature = Signature.getInstance(""SHA512withRSA/PSS"");
    publicSignature.setParameter(new PSSParameterSpec(""SHA-512"", ""MGF1"", MGF1ParameterSpec.SHA512 , 64, 1));
    publicSignature.initVerify(publicKey);
    publicSignature.update(plainText.getBytes(UTF_8));

    return publicSignature.verify(hexToBytes(signature));
}

Note despite the documentation suggesting otherwise (getSaltLength() - ""returns the salt length in bits"") salt length seems to be in bytes!
Also I think ""SHA512withRSA/PSS"" is only supported from Android 23+

"15231056","How to use keytool to run a test and check if JCE is absent or present?","Recently I ran into JDK installs from Oracle which had JCE files such as local_policy.jar present in the jre/lib/security directory but those files were dummies and did not truly enable Unlimited Strength encryption. After replacing them with downloads from Oracle, things went much smoother.
Now I'm thinking that there should be an easy way to sanity-test a system and prevent confusion like this. So, I'm wondering:

Which keytool operation could I run that would only succeed if the appropriate JCE jars were installed and in use?

That way, when it fails I know that local_policy.jar is either not available or there is a useless dummy file in place which should be swapped out with the real one.
","As already mentioned in my various comments, you can use the getMaxAllowedKeyLength() test to determine if a jdk/jre supports unlimited strength cryptography (in my tests i've used the ""AES"" cipher, but ""RC5"" should work as well).  when testing this functionality, you need to have the right jars in place (the contents of the jars being the important bits).  
from my local box, a jdk with limited strength cryptography has a local_policy.jar file with the contents:
// Some countries have import limits on crypto strength. This policy file
// is worldwide importable.

grant {
    permission javax.crypto.CryptoPermission ""DES"", 64;
    permission javax.crypto.CryptoPermission ""DESede"", *;
    permission javax.crypto.CryptoPermission ""RC2"", 128, 
                                     ""javax.crypto.spec.RC2ParameterSpec"", 128;
    permission javax.crypto.CryptoPermission ""RC4"", 128;
    permission javax.crypto.CryptoPermission ""RC5"", 128, 
          ""javax.crypto.spec.RC5ParameterSpec"", *, 12, *;
    permission javax.crypto.CryptoPermission ""RSA"", *;
    permission javax.crypto.CryptoPermission *, 128;
};

whereas a jdk with unlimited strength has the contents:
// Country-specific policy file for countries with no limits on crypto strength.
grant {
    // There is no restriction to any algorithms.
    permission javax.crypto.CryptoAllPermission; 
};

(note that the US_export_policy.jar is the same in both cases).

"27944331","Why is the java method Provider.getService(String type, String algorithm) synchronized?","Many Java libraries are relying on the Provider.getService method, for example MessageDigest, Cipher and many others. When a web server needs hash or encryption as a part of its business flow it uses the Java Security library which eventually calls to the method:
 public synchronized Service getService(String type, String algorithm)

In a multi-threaded server after certain load, many threads are starting to compete for the lock on the above method, which leads to very serious bottleneck affecting the throughput of the server.
We solve this issue by adding Aspect which intercepts methods that eventually call to Provider.getService and cache the instances of these objects in a ThreadLocal.
Could someone explain please, why in first place the developers of the Provider.getService decided to put 'synchronized' on that method?? Why they could not solve the race condition by using ConcurrentMap?
","
Could someone explain please, why in first place the developers of the Provider.getService decided to put 'synchronized' on that method?? Why they could not solve the race condition by using ConcurrentMap?

The Provider.getService(...) method says available since 1.5 so ConcurrentHashMap was written when this the getService(...) code was.  If you look at the code, the call is doing more than executing map operations.  For example:
    // avoid allocating a new key object if possible
    ServiceKey key = previousKey;
    if (key.matches(type, algorithm) == false) {
        key = new ServiceKey(type, algorithm, false);
        previousKey = key;
    }

This sort of get/test/set operation isn't handled by ConcurrentHashMap unless you create the key ahead of time which the programmers might have thought was computationally excessive.
It may also be that they expected folks to do exactly what you are doing which is to create and then cache the instance of the service.  Certainly putting these in ThreadLocals is what I've been doing.
Hope this helps.

Searching google one finds that a JCE Unlimited Policy File is needed.
As you download it, the instalation instructions say that the only thing needed to do 
is to copy both jar files included into /security/ folder of your JRE.
Well that doesn´t work, i've searched all the directories of my machine to find
any other java installation, and i found none. I double checked that the files were correct
Some info:
java -version reports:
java version ""1.6.0_26""
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_26-b03)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 20.1-b02, mixed mode, sharing)
I've installed this Java version using apt-get install sun-java6
Any ideas on this?
","The solution to my problems came from other place and i'll explain here.
Before the error i had:
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(""pkcs12"",""BC"");  
File cert = new File(certPath);     
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(cert);        
ks.load(fis,certpassword.toCharArray());

And now i have: 
KeyStore.Builder builder = null;
ProtectionParameter paramet = new PasswordProtection(certpassword.toCharArray());
builder = KeyStore.Builder.newInstance(""PKCS12"", null, new File(certPath), paramet);
KeyStore ks = builder.getKeyStore();
File cert = new File(certPath);
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(cert);        
ks.load(fis, certpassword.toCharArray());

This code is probably not completely correct but it works.
As for a reason to this i don´t have a clue.
I just tried a different way of loading the certificate and this one worked.
I haven´t tested if this solution works without the unlimited policy files.

PKCS#5 padding is meant to be used with ciphers that have a block size of <= 8 bytes. The block size for AES is 16 bytes. Is all the code that is out there that uses AES with PKCS#5 wrong? Or does the framework internally use PKCS#7 instead? The frameworks in question would be Sun provide in Java, JCE and BouncyCastle.
","The code is indeed using PKCS#7 instead. The reason that ""PKCS5Padding"" is specified is very likely due to compatibility with the older DES and 3DES ciphers. Note that PKCS#5 padding is exactly 8 bytes, not less. Bouncy Castle usually follows the Sun/Oracle providers for the sake of compatibilty, although you can also use the more correct ""PKCS7Padding"" for the Bouncy Castle provider.

","This is a late answer and does not cover all questions. But I wanna share my solution in case anybody else stumbles over here. As for me, I am using LogBack to store logs in my MySQL database. I guess it makes no difference, if you use Oracle or something else, because the connection is done via jdbc and the decryption by jasypt. I assume you know how to use jdbc and jasypt.
This is my example logback.xml:
<configuration>

// Important to extend DriverManagerConnectionSource
public class Connector extends DriverManagerConnectionSource {

  /**

   */
  @Override
  public Connection getConnection() {

      props.load(inputStream);
      config.setAlgorithm(""<algorithm>"");
      config.setPassword(""<jasypt encryption password>"");
      encryptor.setConfig(config);

      return DriverManager.getConnection(String.format(""jdbc:mysql://%s/%s?user=%s&password=%s"",
                                                       props.getProperty(""<ip>""),

    } catch (IOException | SQLException  e) {
      e.printStackTrace();

SecretKey secretKey = keyGen.generateKey();
Cipher desCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""DES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");
desCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE,secretKey);
/* Encryption */
strDataToEncrypt = ""Hello World of Encryption using DES "";
byte[] byteDataToEncrypt = strDataToEncrypt.getBytes();
byte[] byteCipherText = desCipher.doFinal(byteDataToEncrypt); 
strCipherText = new BASE64Encoder().encode(byteCipherText);
System.out.println(""Cipher Text generated using DES with CBC mode and PKCS5 Padding is "" +strCipherText);
/* Decryption */
desCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE,secretKey,desCipher.getParameters());

byte[] byteDecryptedText = desCipher.doFinal(byteCipherText);
strDecryptedText = new String(byteDecryptedText);
System.out.println("" Decrypted Text message is "" +strDecryptedText);

So please kindly suggest me the way to perform the encryption using the above code. It's basically for benchmarking the performance of encryption algorithm over the data in MongoDB.
","What exactly are you trying to encrypt? If you want to encrypt the fields you would call your encrpytion function on the data you were trying store in the BasicDbObject and then store it, then decrypt when it was retrieved. 
I'm not sure what this benchmark is going prove to. MongoDB is not going to have anything to do with how you encrypt your data at the application level.

","On Azure Webapp, you only have the operation permission for the path D:\home\, but no permission for the others include %JAVA_HOME% and Apache Tomcat at the path D:\Program Files (x86)\.
Generally for using some packages, you can directly import these jar files into the directory WEB-INF\lib of the project or the war file. This way is only effective for the current project, and it's safe for the others to avoid clash.
For the file structure of the path D:\home, you can refer to the wiki page https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/File-structure-on-azure to know.
However, according to the doc README.txt in the JCE, it seems to be not possible for installing on Azure Webapp, so I think you can try to use other cryptography packages instead of JCE for your app, such as apache commons codec.

I can confirm that transforming the Public key to a string and back returns the same Public Key. I have also tried testing the code just using bytes, and this works fine. The error is apparently in trying to decrypt the bytes taken from a string.
Is there some way to decrypt bytes taken from a string without throwing this error? Thanks in advance, it is very much appreciated.
EDIT: i think I might have isolated the issue. I am trying to turn an encrypted bytearray into a string, and then extract the bytes from it, but the encrypted bytearray doesn't translate properly into a string anyway so when I get the bytes it doesn't extract what the original encrypted bytearray was. Is that correct, and if so, how do I turn the bytearray into a string properly so we can exchange it?
","If you do this
byte[] ciphertext = RSAEncryption.rSAencrypt(plaintext.getBytes(), pubKeytext);
//String ciphertextString = new String(ciphertext);
//System.out.println(ciphertextString);

PrivateKey privkey = keyPair.getPrivateKey();
byte[] decryptedText = RSAEncryption.rSAdecrypt(ciphertext, privkey);

the code runs perfectly fine. You cannot convert a byte array to a String since the bytes are converted to characters and back to bytes (using getBytes()) - depending on your default charset. new String(ciphertext) strips away unprintable characters which changes the ciphertext and hence makes the plaintext unrecoverable. (Thanks to Artjom B. for pointing that out.)
Simply use Base64 or binary to transport your ciphertext, e.g.:
byte[] ciphertext = RSAEncryption.rSAencrypt(plaintext.getBytes(), pubKeytext);
String ciphertextString = Base64.toBase64String(ciphertext);
System.out.println(ciphertextString);

PrivateKey privkey = keyPair.getPrivateKey();
byte[] decryptedText = RSAEncryption.rSAdecrypt(Base64.decode(ciphertextString), privkey);

Config: Core i5 3570-3.4Ghz, 8Gb RAM (not sure , whether it matters) 
Why encryption takes less time than hashing? Hash functions should be way faster. Am I doing something wrong? 
Thank you
","Please find the results for openssl speed sha1 aes-128-cbc below:
The 'numbers' are in 1000s of bytes per second processed.
type             16 bytes     64 bytes    256 bytes   1024 bytes   8192 bytes

As you can see AES is faster for smaller amounts, and slower for large amounts. Why does this happen? Well, simple. AES uses a block size of 128 bits while SHA-1 uses a block size of 512 bits. So for small amounts of data, SHA-1 has to do much more work. Note that for 64 bytes, SHA-1 has to use 2 full blocks, so it is still rather at a disadvantage. Because of the bigger state size, I expect it will also optimize less easily.
AES is usually also heavily optimized. I'm not sure that SHA-1 in Java has seen the same amount of interest. Nowadays, you would rather look at SHA-2.

"38928702","Difference between RSA Sign with Java and openssl rsautl -sign","I'm trying to write matching code in Java, for this openssl operation:
    openssl rsautl -sign
So far, I tried this: 

Signature sig = Signature.getInstance(""SHA256withRSA"");
sig.initSign(privateKey, SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong());


ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(inputData);
byte[] sBuffer = new byte[1024];
int sBufferLen;
while ((sBufferLen = bais.read(sBuffer)) >= 0) {
        sig.update(sBuffer, 0, sBufferLen);
}
bais.close();

byte[] signature = sig.sign();

Looks like the Java code calculates the SHA-256 hash for the inputData, then signs the hash and returns the signature only.
openssl, on the other hand seems to return the inputData along with the signature.  
I am inferring this using the openssl rsautl -verify operation. Running this operation on the Java signed data returns the ASN1 encoded data with a sha256 object in it. Running this operation on the openssl signed data returns the actual input data.  
Is there any way to mimic what openssl is doing - including the original data with the signature (detached signature?) using Java APIs?
","According to the answer here, while signing:
Java does:
[hash data -> ASN.1 encode -> Pad -> modexp]
openssl only does:
[Pad -> modexp]  
So I had to skip the first two steps in Java, so that it matches openssl rsautl -sign
To do that I looked at the code in the RSASignature class.  
byte[] toBePadded = inputData.getBytes();
RSAPadding padding = RSAPadding.getInstance(1, 512, SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong());
byte[] toBeSigned = padding.pad(toBePadded);
byte[] opensslSignature = RSACore.rsa(toBeSigned, (RSAPrivateKey) privateKey, true);

Edit: Easier to just use ""NONEwithRSA"" signature type:
Signature sig = Signature.getInstance(""NONEwithRSA"");

","It seems like you want to perform password-based encryption. If that is the case, your error is likely caused by using ""AES"" as the algorithm in your Cipher object. Try this instead:
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""PBEWithMD5AndDES"");

Please also note that PBEWithMD5AndDES is very weak by modern standards. If you have any control over the algorithm used, please switch to something stronger. For instance, you could use PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 to produce a key that you then use with AES to encrypt the plaintext.

So I think I have JRE 8 already. How do I tell if I have JCE, and how do I install it properly if it is not there?
","Here are the installation instructions:
1)  Download the unlimited strength JCE policy files.
2)  Uncompress and extract the downloaded file.
This will create a subdirectory called jce.
This directory contains the following files:

    README.txt                   This file
    local_policy.jar             Unlimited strength local policy file
    US_export_policy.jar         Unlimited strength US export policy file

3)  Install the unlimited strength policy JAR files.
In case you later decide to revert to the original ""strong"" but
limited policy versions, first make a copy of the original JCE
policy files (US_export_policy.jar and local_policy.jar). Then
replace the strong policy files with the unlimited strength
versions extracted in the previous step.

The standard place for JCE jurisdiction policy JAR files is:

    <java-home>/lib/security           [Unix]
    <java-home>\lib\security           [Windows]

It was apparently explained in the README.txt where you can get it after you downloaded the zip file(jce_policy-8.zip).

","Yes, WYSIWYG editors will mess your embedded scripts and styles. What I do on my sites is configure JCE to not appear by default.
Go to ""Components > JCE Editor > Profiles > Default > Features and Layout > Editor State"" and set it to ""Off"".
This will give you a generic text area for editing your articles (by default) and a link to turn on WYSIWYG editing.  This way it will not mess up your JavaScript / CSS.
You can also try ""Flexi Custom Code"" module, which works similarly to ""Custom HTML"" module but is intended to be used for JS / CSS instead.
Good luck.

 discussed in many posts, e.g. How to avoid installing "Unlimited Strength" JCE policy files when deploying an application?
Everything works fine of course when I switch the policy files but I would rather avoid this and since I don't plan to use symmetric encryption my guess was that it would be possible. My problem is that that I get the Illegal key size exception already in the load method of KeyStore.
My questions:
1) Can I do anything about the internal encryption in the keystore so the key size limitation doesn't require users to change policy files?
2) I have understood that the BouncyCastle Lightweight API could be an option. If so, how do I load a keystore with that API?
Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());           

//Get private key
KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS12"",""BC"");
String pwd = ""password"";
FileInputStream finJKS = new FileInputStream(""C:\\TEMP\\host.p12"");
keyStore.load(finJKS,pwd.toCharArray());

run:
     java.io.IOException: exception decrypting data - java.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size
Running jre in JDK 7u51 on Netbeans 7.4 on Windows.
Best regards
","Your code snippet throws an InvalidKeyException despite using BouncyCastle, because you are not using the BC Lightweight API. If you access BC through the JCE API then the same limits on crypto strength apply as with Sun/Oracle providers. 
PKCS#12 files are usually encrypted with 3DES (pbeWithSHA1And3-KeyTripleDES-CBC), which is not restricted by the default policy file. However, PKCS#12 allows the use of arbitrary encryption algorithms, so it seems like you got a p12 file that is encrypted with another algorithm. You can check this with openssl:
openssl pkcs12 -in host.p12 -info -noout

The encryption algorithm should change when you convert the keystore to JKS or JCEKS (more secure) with keytool:
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore host.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -deststoretype JCEKS -destkeystore host.jks

Of course you will have to adapt your code then:
KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""JCEKS"");

You could even convert the JCEKS keystore back to PKCS12 with keytool. Keytool generates PKCS12 files with pbeWithSHA1And3-KeyTripleDES-CBC.

","The error message is not related to the the keystore, but rather to the SSL ciphers which your version of Java supports. 
It seems the cipher TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA is configured to be used somewhere, but the version of Java that you use does not provide this cipher. 
When looking at current versions of Java 7, I see this cipher being reported as available, so you can try to run the same with a newer Java version and see if that prevents this warning.

Convert ECIES ECP CryptoPP to JAVA

To get the point out of Crypto++, its about as hard as:
// Assuming your key was DER Encoded
byte key[Z3_KEY_LENGTH] = ...;

ECIES<ECP>::Decryptor decryptor;
decryptor.BERDecodePublicKey(ArraySource(key, sizeof(key)).Ref(), false, sizeof(key));

const ECPPoint& point = decryptor.GetPublicElement();
const Integer& x = point.x;
const Integer& y = point.y;

If your key was not DER Encoded, refer to Keys and Formats from the Crypto++ wiki. You also have the wiki page on Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme.
Java 7 provides and ECPoint class, and it takes an X and Y coordinate.

> ECIES<ECP>::Decryptor ellipticalEnc( keyStr );
> unsigned char *tmpBuffer( new unsigned char[ src.Size() ] );
> DecodingResult dr = ellipticalEnc.Decrypt( rng, src.Data(), src.Size(), tmpBuffer );

This does not look quite right, but you have not showed enough code.
size_t maxLength = decryptor.MaxPlaintextLength( src.Size() );
unsigned char *tmpBuffer = new unsigned char[ maxLength ];

DecodingResult dr = ellipticalEnc.Decrypt( rng, src.Data(), src.Size(), tmpBuffer );
if( !result.isValidCoding )
    throw runtime_error(""failed to decrypt cipher text"");

unsigned char *buffer = new unsigned char[ result.messageLength ];
std::cpy(tmpBuffer, buffer, result.messageLength);

"52220368","Unwrapping RSA encrypted AES key using Safenet HSM and Java leaks the unwrapped key","I am using a Safenet HSM (Hardware Security Module) to store my cryptographic keys, and I am trying to unwrap a secret key (AES/DES) encrypted with RSA using Java APIs and SunPKCS11. I would like to do this securely, so that unwrapped AES/DES key cannot be extracted from the HSM (like the RSA private key value is invisible). However, after unwrapping the value of the unwrapped key is visible in the key object outside the HSM.
Here is my code:
Key privateKey = keyStore.getKey(""MyKeyId"", keyStorePassword);

Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"", ""SunPKCS11-Safenet"");
cipher.init(Cipher.UNWRAP_MODE, privateKey);
Key unwrappedKey = cipher.unwrap(wrappedKey, ""AES"", Cipher.SECRET_KEY);
// At this point the unwrapped key is visible in the unwrappedKey object!

How I can tell the code not to reveal the unwrapped key? Do I have to add something in the PKCS11 config file? I've tried adding the options below into the config file, but it doesn't seem to help:
attributes(*,CKO_SECRET_KEY,*) = {
  CKA_SENSITIVE=true
}

I am not sure if revealing keys during unwrapping is expected from the API. If so, how I can import such keys securely into the HSM so that they cannot be extracted from it?
I've tried asking the Safenet support team, but they could not answer why this is happening. So, after lots of trying and searching the Internet, I have asked this question here.
","If you unwrap the key... you get back the key.  ie, unwrapping a key exposes the key.  If you are asking the HSM to unwrap the key, it is doing what you told it to do.
Maybe you want to import the key instead, if the HSM supports this operation.  The assumption on key import is that the HSM understands the format in which the key has been wrapped for security/protection/transport.  
It will then do the unwrap for you, and save the unwrapped key in its database.  Maybe it then hands you back the key as a handle, or as a differently wrapped key (ie, wrapped using its internal master key).
Moving a key between comparable HSMs is export/import or backup/restore, depending on the device and the devices' understanding of those verbs.
Moving a key between different vendor's HSMs or different cryptosystems, without exposing the secrets is an interesting exercise.

","The extra data in the cipher text at the end is the padding, but you need to call Cipher.doFinal() in both cases - the cipher needs to know it has all the input data before it can add or remove padding.
Cipher.getIV() will return the IV. While the IV might be generated on encryption it is never part of the actual stream and is normally passed around as a parameter or generated.
In case it's the way that the output is getting chunked up that is causing confusion, there's no ""standard"" for this - in the case of BC it always holds onto a block until doFinal() arrives, for some ciphers the SunJCE provider doesn't, for HSMs the input may be buffered to first to make better use of the HSM, so a succession of updates may produce nothing, then suddenly a large chunk of processed data may appear. You need to rely on the return values from the updates and doFinals to tell handle the processed data correctly.

","Use of /dev/random will likely cause start up delays in your Java application as /dev/random blocks until significant entropy to be generated.
In general /dev/urandom will be a more performant and equally secure source of randomness.  Because of Java peculiarities, the vmarg will actually look like:
-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom

However, it is unclear to me why this property is required at all.  The accepted answer works but gives no indication as to why.  I'd be interested to know the cause of the exception.

"30654740","Set up Netty-with TLS handsake with ECC and RSA client certificate auth","I am working on a remote server that uses Netty to perform client authentication with a TLS handshake through the Netty SSLHandler library. This S/O question gives a bit: Set up Netty with 2-way SSL Handsake (client and server certificate)
Now, the question I have about this system is that the Server requires a TrustManager to initialize a SSLContext. From what I observe this uses the SunJSSE provider. Now after setting up this implementation, I got it working with RSA client certs. Now, I am having trouble using ECC client certs as SunJSSE cannot recognize them (I think Java SE 7 include SunEC as a provider. But SunEC is a SunJCE implementation and not a SunJSSE one and thus cannot be used as a provider for TrustManager). So, how do I proceed. I heard Bouncy Castle can recognize these certs, but I still cannot instantiate a TrustManager with BC as the provider.
Edit: Also if there is no way to use TrustManagers, should I do the entire handshake only use BouncyCastle's API's and not netty's libraries? That seems off though.
This is my other S/O question that shows the stack trace: Client ECC SSL Certificate contains "unknown named curve"

Any suggestion?
","to do the encryption right, you're missing some details.
AES is a symmetric cipher taking a key size of 128, 192 or 256 bits.   You cannot just use an RSA private key with any encryption scheme.
For using RSA keys just search the net, for example http://www.java2s.com/Code/Android/Security/RSAencryptdecryptfunctionRSAECBPKCS1Padding.htm
Usually how encryption of longer content (files) is done: 
(please note there are multiple options or modes, what I write here is a simple suggestion) 
Encryption:

generate a random AES key (128bit will do) and nonce (IV) - for IV do not use the fixed vector as it is in your code
use RSA to encrypt the generated key (e.g. RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding)
compute digest (hash) of the content (sha-256)
to the output stream write the encrypted AES key, IV, digest and  encrypted content (AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding).   

Decryption

read the AES key, nonce and digest from the stream 
decrypt the key with your RSA private key 
read the and decrypt the content 
compute digest of the decrypted content and compare it with the already read hash, fail if they do not match

It seems complicated, but skipping any of these steps may (and often will) result in encryption being broken. Even these steps need to have some properties (fixed execution time, etc, but for start you should be ok).

"39244055","How could I prevent Bouncycastle being added as a JCE provider?","I've spent 2 days chasing a strange SSL problem with Tomcat (bad record mac) and I finally found it was caused by Bouncycastle JCE Provider implementation.
This is maybe the third time I had this kind of weird, strange behavior problems (Others being problems reloading webapps, or reading certificate info).
I believe Bouncycastle is a great library, but the fact that it is commonly added as a global provider for the Java process with Security.addProvider(), and that third party libraries do this internally and without warning, makes it a big problem. Example
So, is there a way to prevent BC from being added as a security provider, globally? 
I've tried to use a Security Manager directly and through Tomcat, but I couldn't make it work, and I don't know how could I disable only that action. (I don't want any other change in my system)
My code uses the library but it never needs to add it as a JCE provider. 
I can't  understand why the JCE API works that way and creates such a big point of instability, but maybe that's another question.

According to Java Cryptography Architecture Oracle Providers Documentation for JDK 8, several of these ciphers (for example, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384) are included and enabled by default in java 8.
Does anyone know why the default-enabled ciphers are not showing up and how can I get these ciphers to be added for my server?

"35610017","What is the algorithm for the JCEKS PBE used to encrypt the private key?","I want to decrypt the private key in a Java JCEKS Keystore, and I do not want to use Java.
I can find a description of the PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES, but not the actual implementation.
This comment purportedly explains the derivation:
/**
 * This class implements a proprietary password-based encryption algorithm.
 * It is based on password-based encryption as defined by the PKCS #5
 * standard, except that is uses triple DES instead of DES.
 *
 * Here's how this algorithm works:
 *
 * 1. Create random salt and split it in two halves. If the two halves are
 *    identical, invert one of them.
 * 2. Concatenate password with each of the halves.
 * 3. Digest each concatenation with c iterations, where c is the
 *    iterationCount. Concatenate the output from each digest round with the
 *    password, and use the result as the input to the next digest operation.
 *    The digest algorithm is MD5.
 * 4. After c iterations, use the 2 resulting digests as follows:
 *    The 16 bytes of the first digest and the 1st 8 bytes of the 2nd digest
 *    form the triple DES key, and the last 8 bytes of the 2nd digest form the
 *    IV.
 *
 * @author Jan Luehe
 * @see javax.crypto.Cipher
 */

But, is that first concatenation, password + half-of-salt, or is it half-of-salt + password? Is the input of the following rounds password + digest, or is it digest + password.
Between 8-bit chars, or full 16-bit chars, and the possible combinations of concatenation, you would think that by trial and error I should have worked it out by now.
I know the salt, and the iterations, and the password, and even the plaintext that the ciphertext should decrypt to (i.e. I have the decrypted data).
Deriving a 24-byte DES3 key, whether fixing parity or leaving it alone, and an 8-byte IV, decrypting in DES3 CBC mode, I cannot recreate my plaintext.
What is the algorithm that this comment describes?
","Thank you to erikson 1 who replied to a comment on this answer to another question, and to Ebbe M. Pedersen. In the end, I should have tripped over the answer in trying the different  combinations but somehow missed it.
For those interested, once you open up the JKS and find the entry, the encrypted PKCS#8 shows the JCEKS algorithm 1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.19.1 along with salt and iteration count parameters and with those and your 8-bit/char password you can decrypt the ciphertext to find the inner, unencrypted PKCS#8 holding your private key.
def jce_pbkdf1(password, salt, iterations)
  salts = [copy = salt.dup, copy.slice!((copy.length / 2)..-1)]
  octets = salts.map { |half| (iterations).times.inject(half) { |digest| OpenSSL::Digest.digest('md5', digest + password) } }.join
  return octets[0..23], octets[24..-1] // key (parity not set) and IV

"44333397","How to get JSCh/JCE to work with Java 1.4?","According to http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/, JSch is in pure Java, but it depends on Java Cryptography Extension (JCE). JSch has been known to work with J2SE 1.4.0 or later (no additional libraries required).
Before anyone suggests I upgrade (which would indeed make my life easier), it is not an option: I have to get this working under Java 1.4.2.
So, I downloaded the JSch 0.1.54 source (and the JZLib 1.1.3 source) and fixed a few minor problems here and there. The remaining stumbling block is JCE. Without it, the following classes (found under java.security.interfaces starting with Java 1.5) are missing:
Error:(40, 3) java: cannot find symbol
  symbol:   class ECFieldFp
  symbol:   class ECGenParameterSpec
  symbol:   class ECParameterSpec
  symbol:   class ECPoint
  symbol:   class ECPrivateKey
  symbol:   class ECPrivateKeySpec
  symbol:   class ECPublicKey
  symbol:   class ECPublicKeySpec
  symbol:   class EllipticCurve

Where is the JCE source or jar that will fill this need? The Bouncy Castle page (https://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html) seems to be part of the solution, but there is a bewildering choice of downloads for Java 1.4. I tried lcrypto-jdk14-157 but it's incomplete against the above list: it supplies only ECPoint and ECPrivateKey.
","According to the change log, the support was added since version 0.1.52. These classes are used in com/jcraft/jsch/jce/KeyPairGenECDSA.java, KeyPairECDSA.java, ECDH.hava, SignatureECDSA.java and other new files to support ECDSA key.
If you don't have to connect a server supported only ECDSA key.  A solution is downloading source code from sourceforge.net, building the jar file using JDK 1.4.2. There is one compatible problem:
jsch-0.1.51/src/main/java/com/jcraft/jsch/Util.java:490: replace(char,char) in java.
lang.String cannot be applied to (java.lang.String,java.lang.String)
    str = str.replace(""~"", System.getProperty(""user.home""));

All you have to is fixing this error.

    }

","I think I've found it. For some reason the code above derives an encryption-key by seeding a SecureRandom instance with the existing encryption key to get a new byte[] (don't ask me why, it was a long time ago it was written). This is then fed to the SecretKeySpec constructor. If I skip all this and just feed the SecretKeySpec constructor the encryption key that we already have then the unit test passes. The code that does the encryption now looks like this:
final SecretKeySpec secretKeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(encryptionKey, CIPHER_ALGORITHM);

// Instantiate the cipher
final Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(CIPHER_TRANSFORMATION);

cipher.init(cryptionMode, secretKeySpec, iv);
return cipher;

The odd thing is that it has worked on Windows. Looks like the SecureRandom implementations behave differently on OS X and on Windows. Calling setSeed on OS X appends to the seed whereas Windows replaces it. 
Update: found some more details on the implementation differences of SecureRandom: http://www.cigital.com/justice-league-blog/2009/08/14/proper-use-of-javas-securerandom/

"19449002","JCE security provider in OSGi","We have a problem using a custom JCA implementation in our OSGi bundle. The JCA implementation that we are forced to use by our customer leads to a class loader memory leak. This prevents the deployment and usage of it in our bundle, because we quickly run into a perm gen space problem.
The proposed solution from the JCA provider is to put the JAR in the jre/lib/ext folder, but it is not loaded from there. This is due, as far as I know, to the OSGi (Eclipse equinox) class loader policy to have the bootstrap classloader as the parent of each bundle classloader, which excludes the extension class loader that loads from the jre/lib/ext folder. I.e. no bundle ever sees anything in the jre/lib/ext folder.
Is there a way to get Eclipse equinox to load a jar that is registered as a security provider, only once, such that all bundles or a specific bundle can see that provider? The fact that the JCA library is not unloaded via OSGi could be tolerated in this instance.
","You should edit the system packages and add the packages from the JCA-custom.jar.
You can define which packages should be included in several ways.

You create a profile for equinox and define the packages. You can find examples for each jdk versions in the eclipse.osgi jar. For example, look for JavaSE-1.6.profile and try finding the entry org.osgi.framework.system.packages
You can define it as a system variable when you start your OSGi container. The system variable is the same: -Dorg.osgi.framework.system.packages=package names separated by comma

I found a couple of questions so I fixed the issue by setting the crypto.policy property to unlimited in my code: 
Security.setProperty(""crypto.policy"", ""unlimited"");

I deployed the war in a JBoss in my machine, and it works.

","OK, this doesn't seem to be an easy to answer question. From what I found so far, it appears that the required length for this input depends on the actual provider used, in case of the default provider this is probably sun.security.provider.SecureRandom. This implementation uses a MessageDigest with a size of 20 bytes, therefore 20 bytes can be used as input for the setSeed(byte[])-method.
private static final int DIGEST_SIZE = 20;

More wouldn't probably add entropy to it. Other implementations might use even less; I didn't find one that uses more bytes so far.

"34822839","Enabling AES-256 Cipher suites on Openfire","I'm putting together an XMPP server for a project of mine, and I have rather strict encryption standards. Namely, I need the TLS protocol to only utilize AES-256 cipher suites and their equivalents. Basically, anything that doesn't require the JCE unlimited policy, I want excluded. Yes, I know that it's highly prohibitive on the client because they need to be able to use/install the JCE policy. I'm ok with that, and I'm not allowed to work around it.
As I understand, Openfire runs off of the base JRE. I've found how to install the JCE unlimited policy in the JRE, and further how to remove cipher suites from the java environment via jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms in java.security. However, my testing shows that even when I set up an environment where the client and server have no shared supported suites, and encrypted connections are set to ""required,"" a client can still connect and communicate. I'm specifically trying to avoid this behavior. 
Furthermore, with the release of Openfire 4.0, and the ability to modify the list of enabled cipher suites directly, I notice that AES-256 ciphers are not on the supported list in the first place, even when the JCE unlimited policy is installed. Meaning, whether i remove unacceptable cipher suites in jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms or directly in in Openfire, Openfire is not importing the AES-256 suites i need, regardless of the JCE policy.
Is there a way to add cipher suites to the Openfire list, so long as the cipher suites are supported by the underlying JRE/JCE?
","Nevermind. I found that Openfire was using its own JRE from the install rather than the general JRE in program files. Re-copied the JCE files to the new runtime and it works perfectly.

","Vedat, 
KeySafe doesn't know about JCE (which is ironic as it is itself a Java program).  It shows you the underlying objects in the Security World.  You're getting one actual key file containing your key data (encrypted by the HSM master key) and the plaintext alias (""MyAESKey""), and one file representing the KeyStore.  If you open up your keystore.dat file with a text editor, you'll see that it contains an identifier that shows up in the filename of the other files: this is how the software ties things together.  
The files in Key Management Data\local are completely abstracted away by the JCE KeyStore API implementation: all you need to reference the keys in a KeyStore is the file for it: keystore.dat in your example.

"49938492","How to use PKCS#11 CKM_AES_KEY_WRAP mechanism in Java?","I'm working with some PKCS#11 tokens that insist on using CKM_AES_KEY_WRAP for unwrapping AES-encrypted keys. On these tokens, CKM_AES_CBC and friends don't support unwrap.
At the other end of this system, I therefore need to wrap a key using a PKCS#11 token accessed via Java.
SunPKCS11 doesn't appear to support CKM_AES_KEY_WRAP. Neither does IAIK, as far as I can tell. Does anyone have any suggestions for achieving this in Java?
","CKM_AES_KEY_WRAP is rather simple mechanism so you don't need your PKCS#11 wrapper library to provide nice constants or enum members to use it.
You should be fine as long as your PKCS#11 wrapper library allows you to specify wrapping mechanim as ulong and its parameters as byte[]. SunPKCS11 is quite limited so I would try with IAIK first.
Following code sample demonstrates the idea with Pkcs11Interop wrapper for .NET:
// Acquire handle to keys
ObjectHandle wrappingKey = new ObjectHandle();
ObjectHandle toBeWrappedKey = new ObjectHandle();

// Define mechanism yourself
ulong CKM_AES_KEY_WRAP = 0x00002109;
byte[] CKM_AES_KEY_WRAP_PARAM = new byte[] { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08 };
Mechanism mechanism = new Mechanism(CKM_AES_KEY_WRAP, CKM_AES_KEY_WRAP_PARAM);

// Perform wrapping
byte[] wrappedKey = session.WrapKey(mechanism, wrappingKey, toBeWrappedKey);

"13842231","Encryption - IV length is different than provided","I've been struggling with encryption for a while now, and I'm about to complete the process, however, I'm now encountering some issues with the IV. Here's my code: 
IV generation
public static byte[] createIV(int size) { 
 byte[] iv = new byte[size];
 SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
 random.nextBytes(iv);   

 return iv; 
}

AES-256 cipher creation (key)
public static Map<String, byte[]> cipherAES() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
     Map<String, byte[]> aes = new HashMap<String, byte[]>();
     aes.put(""IV"", ConversionUtil.toHex(createIV(16), 16).getBytes());
     KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""AES"");
     keyGen.init(256);
     Key encryptionKey = keyGen.generateKey();
     aes.put(""key"", encryptionKey.getEncoded());

     return aes;
}

toHex method
public static String toHex(byte[] data, int length) {
     StringBuffer buf = new StringBuffer();

     for (int i = 0; i != length; i++) {
        int v = data[i] & 0xff;

        buf.append(DIGITS.charAt(v >> 4));
        buf.append(DIGITS.charAt(v & 0xf));
     }

        return buf.toString();
}

Cipher initialization
  SecretKey key = new SecretKeySpec(map.get(""key""), 0, map.get(""key"").length, ""AES"");
  Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");
  cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, new IvParameterSpec(map.get(""IV""), 0, 16));

If I provide an IV of 16 bytes with this format to the cipher: 
8E12399C07726F5A8E12399C07726F5A

When I call the getIV method on the Cipher, I get this: 
8E12399C07726F5A

which is exactly half the bytes I provided for the IV. This is currently causing several issues, since the server can decrypt the second part of the message but not the first one. 
I'm using JCE libraries only:
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

Can anyone shed some light on this? Let me know if you need further details.
","As mentioned in the comments by CodesInChaos and bimsapi, your error lies in your conversion of the IV value into hexadecimal. A simple correction to your cipherAES() method would be:
public static Map<String, byte[]> cipherAES() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
     Map<String, byte[]> aes = new HashMap<String, byte[]>();
     aes.put(""IV"", createIV(16)); // <-- no need for conversion
     KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""AES"");
     keyGen.init(256);
     Key encryptionKey = keyGen.generateKey();
     aes.put(""key"", encryptionKey.getEncoded());
     return aes;
}

Note also that your method design is a little odd. Returning a map of strings to byte arrays is quite brittle and prone to errors. Consider instead returning an object that stores these items. In that object I would store the key as a Key, not a byte array.

","Vedat, the nCipherKM Provider generates actual key material on the Hardware Security Module(s) it connects to.  The HSM is designed to not let you have the actual key bits: keeping those secret is its purpose in life.  
The second sequence will obtain random data from the HSM's random generator, which is a NIST Special Publication 800-90A compliant Deterministic Random Bit Generator seeded by hardware-based entropy.  This is the same type of random material the HSM uses internally to generate keys.  Since you don't seem to have any HSM protection requirements for the resulting keys, you should be good to go.

","According to the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) Reference Guide under How to Make Applications ""Exempt"" from Cryptographic Restrictions, you could bundle a policy file stating exemptions with your application's JAR, but the JAR must then be signed and it is not even sure that Oracle's default crypto providers support this:

(NOTE: The SunJCE provider does not supply an implementation of the ExemptionMechanismSpi class.)

Needless to say, I have not tested this way... ;) This looks way more complicated than replacing two files.

","It simply means the JCE meets FIPS requirements. The main difference is that some less-secure ciphers are removed (like DES). Because most strong ciphers already meet FIPS requirements, you wouldn't be able to see differences by checking maximum key sizes.

","This is the expected result. If you look at the Nist 800-38D, page 15, you will see that:
if len(IV)=96 then 
   Y0=IV||0^31||1 
else 
   Y0=GHASH(H,{},IV).

So, the larger IV's are not trimmed there are additional operations are recommended. In this way, you can have higher entropy for your IVs.

We have a problem when we try to use certain classes like Cipher, KeyAgreement, KeyGenerator, Mac, or SecretKeyFactory. 
Java throws an exception:
Exception in thread ""main"" java.security.NoSuchProviderException: JCE cannot authenticate the provider Foo

I read here and here that a custom JCE security provider must be signed, if you try to use it for encryption. This is because of some laws in some governments regarding cryptography.
I also read this post:
How to sign a custom JCE security provider
It seems that the advice is to mail Oracle some info about your company/product and send the csr so they can issue a certificate that can be used for code signing and is valid fo 5 years.
My question is, is there any way to get around this for testing purposes? By, for example, changing some policies or self-signing the JAR. We tried self-signing the JAR, it didn't work maybe we did something wrong.
Has anyone had any luck overcoming this issue without getting the certificate from Oracle?
At the end, we will apply for the certificate, but I read that it can take up to 10 days to get the response, and we need this for testing.
","Yes, what you can do is patch the JarVerifier.class file inside jce.jar. Jce.jar is part of your JRE/JDK (depends whether you have just the Runtime Environment or the Development Kit installed). This method is tedious and involved, but it’s the best way to ensure you don’t touch any other code besides the jar verification code.
For these steps you will need the JDK installed, as well as a hex editor.
On my Windows installation for example, jce.jar is located at C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_77\jre\lib\jce.jar.
Once you’ve found it, open jce.jar in a zip file editor (e.g. WinZip, 7zip). Navigate to javax\crypto\ and extract JarVerifier.class to your Desktop or other desired location to work on it. Also, make a backup copy of this file!!
Now here comes the detective work. Open a terminal and cd to where you extracted JarVerifier.class. Run this command: javap -c JarVerifier.class
This will show you a reconstructed Java bytecode version of the code in the class file. You’ll see a method called void verify() throws ... JarException ....
In my version of the JRE, the code for verify() begins as follows:
aload_0
getfield #15
ifnonnull 17
new #20

etc...
The verify method works by using exceptions to tell the calling method if the given jar is not properly signed. If no exceptions are thrown, then it is assumed that everything is OK, and the JCE provider can be used. We can use this to our advantage by simply changing the first instruction of the verify() method to the op-code for return.
Pull up this webpage of Java bytecode instructions as a reference: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode_instruction_listings. We want to find where exactly this sequence of instructions is inside our JarVerifier.class file, so we need to convert the bytecode printed out by javap earlier to hexadecimal numbers. We will then search for this string of numbers inside JarVerifier.class to find exactly where the verify() method is.
So.. using the Wikipedia page as reference, it goes like this:

aload_0: 2A
getfield #15: B4 00 0F
ifnonnull 17: C7 <2 byte branch offset>
new #20: BB 00 14

It’s a little tedious to calculate the branch offset, and we don’t need it in our search.
Now, search for the following hex string of bytes: 2AB4000FC7. In my version of the JRE there is only one match. Verify that BB 00 14 is also present 2 bytes after C7, just to make sure this is really the verify() method.
Finally, the patch. The opcode for return is B1. Simply replace the 2A representing aload_0 with the value B1. In my version, this was at the offset 0x2938. Now, all verify() does is just return!
Save your file, exit, and run the above javap command on your new JarVerifier.class file to see the result of your change. You should see that the first instruction in verify() is a return.
Using your zip file editor from above, replace JarVerifier.class inside jce.jar with your modified version. Save the jar file if necessary.
That’s it! JCE jar verification has been disabled.

"39338094","Creating an external (2-steps) signature with bouncycastle and SunMSCAPI","I'm trying to remove some deprecated BC code from my application, but I'm having problem switching the old CMSSignedDataGenerator.addSigner to the new API.
Our old code, which worked on Linux (PKCS11 provider) and Windows (SunMSCAPI) was something like this:
CMSSignedDataGenerator gen = new CMSSignedDataGenerator();

CertStore certStore = CertStore.getInstance(""Collection"",new CollectionCertStoreParameters(Arrays.asList(certChain)));

Attribute attrHash = new Attribute(CMSAttributes.messageDigest, new DERSet( new DEROctetString(hash) ) ); 
Attribute attrcontentType = new Attribute(CMSAttributes.contentType, new DERSet( CMSObjectIdentifiers.data ) );
ASN1EncodableVector v = new ASN1EncodableVector(); 
v.add(attrHash); 
v.add(attrcontentType);

gen.addSigner(aPrivateKey, userCertificate, CMSSignedDataGenerator.DIGEST_SHA1, new AttributeTable(v), null); 
gen.addCertificatesAndCRLs(certStore); 

CMSSignedData s = gen.generate(CMSSignedDataGenerator.DATA, null, false, getProviderName() ); 

return s.getEncoded();

The provider name would be either ""SunMSCAPI"" or whatever we are dynamically using for PKCS#11 on Linux.
Both addSigner and generate methods got deprecated in BC, so now I'm doing the following:
    CMSSignedDataGenerator gen = new CMSSignedDataGenerator();
    Store certStore = new JcaCertStore(Arrays.asList(certChain));

    Attribute attrHash = new Attribute(CMSAttributes.messageDigest, new DERSet(new DEROctetString(hash)));
    Attribute attrcontentType = new Attribute(CMSAttributes.contentType, new DERSet(CMSObjectIdentifiers.data));
    ASN1EncodableVector v = new ASN1EncodableVector();
    v.add(attrHash);
    v.add(attrcontentType);

    ContentSigner sha1Signer = new JcaContentSignerBuilder(""SHA1withRSA"").setProvider(provider).build(aPrivateKey);
    gen.addSignerInfoGenerator(
            new JcaSignerInfoGeneratorBuilder(new JcaDigestCalculatorProviderBuilder().setProvider(provider).build())
                    .setSignedAttributeGenerator(new DefaultSignedAttributeTableGenerator(new AttributeTable(v)))
                    .build(sha1Signer, userCertificate));

    gen.addCertificates(certStore);
    CMSSignedData s = gen.generate(new CMSAbsentContent(), false);
    return s.getEncoded();

The problem with this new code is that it works perfectly when using ""BC"" as a provider, but when I switch to ""SunMSCAPI"" I get th following exception:
no such algorithm: SHA-1 for provider SunMSCAPI

This convoluted way of signing is just because we need to sign a digest, we don't have the full content available for signing, so I have to pass the digest pre-computed to the signing method.
Can anyone please help me find out what could possible be wrong with the above code?

I want to do this to verify JWT signatures.
e.g. https://api.github.com/users/davidcarboni/keys: 
ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBK8hPtB72/sfYgNw1WTska2DNOJFx+QhUxuV6OLINSD2ty+6gxcM8yZrvMqWdMePGRb2cGh8L/0bGOk+64IQ/pM=

It looks like I can use ECPublicKeySpec. This takes two parameters. An ECPoint and an ECParameterSpec. I'm able to get the parameter spec using the following JCE code (and the openssh identifier from the key data, say ""nistp256""):
ECParameterSpec getECParameterSpec(String identifier) {
    try {
        AlgorithmParameters parameters = AlgorithmParameters.getInstance(""EC"");
        String name = identifier.replace(""nist"", ""sec"") + ""r1"";

    } catch (InvalidParameterSpecException | NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Unable to get parameter spec for identifier "" + identifier, e);
    }
}

I've successfully parsed the Q value from the key data. RFC 5656 tells me that ""Q is the public key encoded from an elliptic curve point into an octet string"") however the constructor of JCE's ECPoint class takes two parameters, X and Y.
Can I get to X and Y from Q, or do I need to take a different approach? 
(NB I quite rightly don't have access to the private key)

65 63 64 jumped out to me as ""ecd"" (sure enough, ""ecdsa-sha2-nistp256"").
So the blob looks to be

Big Endian length of a string/payload (19)
The string ""ecdsa-sha2-nistp256""
Big Endian length of a string/payload (8)
The string ""nistp256""
Big Endian length of a payload (0x41 == 65)
The encoded ECPoint Q (04 AF 21 ... 10 FE 93)

The encoded ECPoint starts with 04 indicating it is an uncompressed point (the most common encoding).  The 04 encoding rules (from http://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf, 2.3.5, step 3) say that the remaining payload is X and Y, each left-padded with zeros to the encoding size of the curve field.
So your ECPoint looks like
04
Qx:
AF 21 3E D0 7B DB FB 1F 62 03 70 D5 64 EC 91 AD
83 34 E2 45 C7 E4 21 53 1B 95 E8 E2 C8 35 20 F6

16 F6 70 68 7C 2F FD 1B 18 E9 3E EB 82 10 FE 93

In C# you'd need to a) reverse the bytes of each of Qx and Qy (because the .NET BigInteger expects Little Endian, and these are Big Endian) and b) put a padding 0x00 byte as more significant than the 0xAF and 0xB7 bytes, since they have their high bits set (and would be interpreted as negative numbers).  Don't know if Java has either of those quirks.

"11371541","Does Clojure (or JCE, or JVM, or...?) introduce parallelism automatically?","I am running some CPU-intensive Clojure code from within Intellij Idea (I don't think that's important - it seems to just spawn a process).  According to both htop and top, it is using all 4 cores (well, 2 + hyperthreading) on my laptop.  This is despite me not having any explicit parallelism in the code.
A little more detail: top shows a single process with ~380% CPU use, while htop shows a ""parent"" process and then 4 ""children"", each with 1/4 the time and ~100% CPU.
Is this normal?  Or does it mean I have got something very wrong somewhere?  The code involves many lazy sequences, but at its core modifies a mutable data structure (a mutable - not a Clojure data structure - hash that accumulates results).  I am not using any explicit parallelism.
A significant amount of time is likely (I haven't profiled) spent in JCA/JCE (crypto lib) - I am using multiple AES ciphers in CTR mode, each as a stream of secure random bytes (code here), implemented as lazy seqs.  Perhaps that is parallelized?
More random ideas:  Could this be related to IO?  I'm running on an encrypted SSD and this program is processing data from disk, so does a lot of reading.  But htop shows system time as red, and these are green.
Sorry for such a vague question.  I can post more info if required.  This is Clojure 1.4 on 64bit Linux (JDK 1.7.0_05).  The code being executed is here but it's pretty messy (more apologies) and spread across various files (most CPU time is spent in nearest-in-dump in the code there).  Note - please don't waste time trying to run code to reproduce, as it expects a pre-existing data-dump to be on disk (which isn't in git).
debugger Running in the debugger (thanks, A-M) shows four threads (if I understand the debugger correctly), but only one is executing the program. They are labelled finalizer, main (the program), reference handler, and signal dispatcher. Finalizer + ref handler are in wait state; signal dispatcher has no frames available.  I tentatively think this means the parallelism is at a lower level, perhaps in the crypto implementation?
Aha I think it's parallel GC (Java now has a concurrent collector).  At the start, CPU use jumps way up when the actual process pauses (it prints out a regular tick).  And since it's churning through lots of data it's generating a lot of short-lived objects (confirmed by using -XX:+UseSerialGC which reduces CPU use to 100%)
","OK, I feel a bit dumb posting this as it now looks pretty obvious, but it seems to be parallel GC.  I am processing a lot of data (sucking it in from an SSD) and generating lots of short-lived objects.  And it appears that the JVM has parallel GC.  See http://blog.ragozin.info/2011/12/garbage-collection-in-hotspot-jvm.html
It may also be a sign of a problem - What is going on with java GC? PermGen space is filling up? - which I will investigate tomorrow (I didn't mention it - although in retrospect I should have - but this is borderline running out of memory).
Update: Running with -XX:+UseSerialGC reduces the total CPU use to 100% (ie 1 core).  But I didn't really mean that the two explanations above were exclusive, only that with better configuration and/or code I could reduce the amount of GC.

Is there a programmatic way to check for these files from within the app?  thanks.
","Turns out, as GregS points out above, that the program was not failing silently, but swallowing the exception.  The call to KeyStore.store() was throwing an IOException that I was catching with a generic catch (Exception e) farther below.  Once catching the IOException separately, the program now works properly.

"31052370","Provider-independent crypto in Java?","I'm trying to write a program in Java that will digitally sign database entries prior to insertion. I would like for the program to be algorithm-independent - ideally, the user would specify the JCE provider and algorithm as arguments at runtime.
Is there a way to do this? I've been testing with the BouncyCastle provider, and the code runs fine when I dynamically register it:
Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());

However, when I try to statically register the provider by adding the following lines to the end of my security/java.policy file, I get the error: java.security.NoSuchProviderException: no such provider: BC when I try to get an instance of a Security object using the provider.
security.provider.1=sun.security.provider.Sun
security.provider.2=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider

Specifically, I added those lines to /etc/java-7-openjdk/security/java.policy (which is linked to $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.policy). This is on Ubuntu 12.04. I also tried just adding the BouncyCastleProvider as the first entry and got the same error.
Am I configuring the static registration wrong or is what I am attempting impossible?
","I think you are adding the static registration into the wrong file.
Use security.policy instead of java.policy within the same folder.

","Bluemix supports overlaying the JRE if you push the server directory.
Assuming you are pushing a directory called defaultServer, create the following directory:
defaultServer/resources/.java-overlay/.java/jre/lib/security

Download the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) unlimited strength policy JAR files from IBM and place them in the created overlay directory.
Push the directory using:
$ cf push <yourappname> -p defaultServer

These JAR files will overlay the default policy JARS in the Java runtime.

http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=21417

Query
We are developing a JCE provider and would like a way to statically register it so other apps can use it. It would also be useful if security properties can be set statically because we use them to set default algorithms and other options. In standard java both of these can be done by setting properties in the file /jre/lib/security/java.security.
Response
I'm going to decline this at this time. Android doesn't really support sharing code this way. If some kind of shared library mechanism is added to the platform, then this could be revisited. For now, apps will have to bundle providers within themselves.

I realise that jcecsp is not in the recognised app list of --retarget command.
So my questions is: is there a way to add jcecsp as an supported application for generatekey --retarget command? or this is simply not possible in nShield HSM?
I got this error output:
$ generatekey --retarget jcecsp
ERROR: sorry, application jcecsp is not currently usable

","jcecsp is a little weird in that operations need to go through Java's KeyStore API.  You might be able to use Java keytool's -importkeystore option with SunPKCS11 as source, and nCipher.sworld as destination.  If this works, you'll have effectively retargeted the key.  The Java layer, working through the keystore file, ensures that key can be found again when JCE tries to access it.
You'll be dancing with a lot of options... SunPKCS11 docs are here https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html and see the Thales docs for what to feed it about the nCipherKM side.

This asymmetric cryptosystem is an implementation of ElGamal. The library provides a mechanism for generating keypairs and for encrypting and decrypting data.
The public and private keys of this cryptosystem do not currently implement any interface (they have no connection with Key from java.security).
However we now have the requirement that we need to store an ElGamal public key inside an X509 certificate. To do this we plan on implementing the java.security.PublicKey interface in our proprietary public key, as this will allow us to pass our proprietary public key as a PublicKey (to allow it to be stored in a certificate).  However, implementing PublicKey means that we must now implement three new methods in our PublicKey, these are:

public String getAlgorithm()
public String getFormat()
public byte[] getEncoded()

The getEncoded() method should return the public key encoded in some way. In keeping with convention, we would like to encode the data using X509 format.
We question is: how can the contexts of an arbitrary object be encoded using this encoding format?
","X.509 specifies the format of a certificate. The public key itself is just one part of it. Within the X.509 data structure it is stored as a bit string (so basically raw binary data).
The getEncoded method typically returns the DER encoding of a SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure which contains the algorithm encoded as an ASN.1 object identifier and the bits of the public key itself.
The documentation of Key gives some more details.

The getEncoded() method should return the public key encoded in some way. In keeping with convention, we would like to encode the data using X509 format.
We question is: how can the contexts of an arbitrary object be encoded using this encoding format?
","Henry is of course correct, however stopping with SubjectPublicKeyInfo is a bit of a tricky thing, as SubjectPublicKeyInfo is little more than a definition of a container.
If you encode an ElGamal public key using the getEncoded specified by Bouncy Castle then you will get this ASN.1 structure:
SEQUENCE (2 elem)
  SEQUENCE (2 elem)
    OBJECT IDENTIFIER: 1.3.14.7.2.1.1
    SEQUENCE (2 elem)
      INTEGER (2048 bit): 3231…
      INTEGER: 2
  BIT STRING (1 elem)
    INTEGER (2048 bit): 2072…

So that's a SubjectPublicKeyInfo (first sequence) with an ElGamal algorithm identifier (and ElGamal OID), which in turn contains the large prime and generator (with value 2). Then comes the BIT STRING, which contains an INTEGER with the public key value.
Note that I find it exceedingly hard to find out if the above is specified anywhere. IOW seems to have been some workshop in which NIST was also involved. ElGamal encryption is not used much anymore.

However when encrypting in JCE, two ciphertexts are never the same because the initialization creates a random IV, as directed.
Is there some way to fix the IV for initiliazation so the Javascript can pass it to the Java server? The documentation for the JCE gives me nothing.
Thanks in advance, its much appreciated.
EDIT: its come to my attention that the IV is used for the padding. I'm using PKCS1 padding, if that changes anything.
EDIT: I've done some more reading, and apparently the difference between the ciphertexts is due to the padding. While I appreciate that this is working as directed, I need the client to be able to decrypt the encrypted text. If I pass it the ciphertext encrypted with the public key, will the client be able to decrypt it even without knowing anything about the padding, even if its a different library and language doing the decrypting?

I searched my web logs and at the same time that I get the e-mail alert that my anti-virus detected the backdoor, I can see ""Bot for JCE"" attempting to access what is supposed to be the backdoor PHP files - thankfully getting nothing more than an error 404.

Although thankful that my antivirus is finding the virus before it can be exploited, I obviously need to plug the hole in the site.
TL/DR -- Since I'm not seeing anything obvious on my website access logs, is there a way to have something installed on the server identify exactly where the file is being uploaded from? That is - I want to know exactly what page/script on my site they're accessing that's allowing them to upload to the WAMP TMP directory.

"54776057","Validate JCE certificates during Eclipse install","During installation of Eclipse (using Eclipse Installer) I get asked ""Do you trust these certificates?"", listing two certificates for Bouncy Castle (one signed by Sun, one by Oracle) and one certificate for Eclipse (signed by Sun). How can I validate these certificates?

I understand that this are code signing certificates for JCE (Java Cryptography Extension), i.e. certificates signed by Oracle for encryption, key generation and key agreement, and Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms. I also know that Bouncy Castle is in common use for providing algorithms related to encryption.
Two questions:

All certificates are signed by the same two CAs, but I cannot find a (public) list of ""official"" CA certificate fingerprints. How can I validate these?


JCE Code Signing CA, issued by and to Sun Microsystems Inc, valid to 2020-04-25, fingerprint 57:37:D1:E1:16:2F:F6:FE:26:B9:87:88:D2:86:DA:66:7F:98:54:3C

Why are those CAs not trusted by default, i.e. included in some trust store supplied with the JDK/JRE? The CAs are operated by Oracle (at least the CA certificates say so 😉), the JRE I'm using is provided by Oracle (openjdk 11.0.2), I see no reason the CAs should not be trusted (given they are indeed legit).

As with all our users, they have the unlimited security policy jars installed.
The server certificate is self-signed (not CA). They use 127.0.0.1 as the hostname since they're just connecting to a backend process.
A default installation of the JRE/JDK works (using Sun/Oracle security providers). Using javax.net.debug output, I have confirmed that these successful connections use the same self-signed certificate.
However, when I hacked together some code to simply establish a connection, it works without issue using the same truststore, keystore, certificate, and JDK on the same machine. This uses the same verification function which makes the same call to X509TrustManager.checkServerTrusted() using the same certificate and the same authType string. I cannot for the life of me explain why checkServerTrusted() verifies the cert in this case but fails in the user's case.
Is it possible that there's some way to tweak the JCE such that the X509TrustManager would fail to verify this cert? Perhaps because it's self-signed, or because the common name is the name of the service and not a domain name? I see nothing in their JVM parameters or security properties to indicate this. But perhaps they're making some JCE call I don't know about which modifies X509TrustManager's behavior?
The javax.net.debug output for the cert is below. The common name is simply the name of our adopter's service. That seems fishy to me. However, it works with the default security providers.

","It turns out that this is an issue with caching the trust manager.
With either the default providers or our custom provider, the trust manager is initially instantiated with the cacerts truststore.
With the default providers, a new trust manager is later instantiated using the javax.net.ssl.trustStore-specified truststore. Our custom provider just re-uses the previously instantiated cacerts trust manager.
Solution: Instantiate a new trust manager, which will respect javax.net.ssl.trustStore.

","This is a complicated and difficult question to answer. First of all, encrypting 4GB worth of file is going to take time no matter what you do.

"46207908","Unit testing encrypt/decrypt with some salt located in different code bases","First of all I shall mention that I have seen Unit testing of encrypt/decrypt, and Unit testing encryption and decryption in Java.
I want to protect a library by validating its license. The license contains information such as maximum users and expiration time and so on.
The problems I encounter are:

The encryptor and decryptor are in two different code bases. The decryptor is packaged with the library, but encryptor is not, so it is hard to have them both in the same test suite!
A random salt is used within encryptor, so even with same input the encryptor produces a different output each time, again I can not do assertion on the result.
For the sake of its purpose the decryptor (to make it harder to inject another class for it) is a final class, and all of its methods are private, except a few package accessible entry points.

I don't want to test JCE, but I want to test my code which does:

Extracting the salt from the encrypted license,
Deciphers the encrypted license,
Deserializes the output to some data structure containing license data,

Shall I create a clone of the the code, with some softer access constraints and test that? Then the problem is I am not testing the real code which is run on client systems.
Are there any better solutions to do this?
","From what you described I don't see a problem in testing them separately.


The encryptor and decryptor are in two different code bases. 


Not an issue if you test them separately.


A random salt is used within encryptor


You can inject a mock random generator that will produce the same results.


For the sake of its purpose the decryptor is a final class, and all of its methods are private


Many ways to test private methods as can be seen here


Extracting the salt from the encrypted license


All you need for that is an encrypted license that you know the salt of.


Deciphers the encrypted license


Similarly, you can use a license that you know what it deciphers to.


Deserializes the output to some data structure containing license data,


Not related and is a separate test of the deserialization code.

","It's not clear to me how you'd apply PKCS #5 padding to a stream cipher. It might make sense to devise a bit-oriented padding for 1-bit CFB in order to pad out the last byte, but PKCS5Padding (PKCS #7, really) pads with bytes to fill out the final block. But a stream cipher doesn't have a block size. Don't you want NoPadding instead?
I suspect that the CFB mode engine is returning 0 as the block size, since it is undefined. When the padding engine tries to use this block size in its computation, the arithmetic error is thrown. (If this is what's happening, it would be better for BouncyCastle to validate the block size and throw a more specific error here.)

https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYKE2_9.0.0/com.ibm.java.multiplatform.90.doc/user/compsec_jce_algos.html
","In general '3-key' and '2-key' (aka triple-length and double-length key) are keying options 1 and 2 of the cipher commonly called Triple-DES or 3DES or TDES or DES-EDE, although it was officially defined as TDEA. (In Java crypto, DES-EDE is customarily spelled with no hyphen and second part lowercase = DESede -- although case is ignored when algorithms are looked up by Cipher.getInstance() and similar.) This applies in both password-based encryption as here, and regular (key-based) encryption. 
The mappings in the table clearly show that IBM implements the two schemes of password-based encryption (for private keys) using 3DES with these two keying options, defined by PKCS12 aka rfc7292 in appendix C:
pbeWithSHAAnd3-KeyTripleDES-CBC  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {pkcs-12PbeIds 3}
pbeWithSHAAnd2-KeyTripleDES-CBC  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {pkcs-12PbeIds 4}

IBM provides several spellings of each name (with -CBC omitted) and for the 3-key scheme also the names with keying NOT specified PBEWith{SHA-1,SHA1,SHA}And{3DES,DESede,TripleDES} and the OID (which is usually more helpful for interchange) {,OID.}1.2.840.113549.1.12.1.3 as synonyms. This may be intended to ease transition from the Oracle-was-Sun-and-OpenJDK implementation, which implements only the 3-key scheme with the tweaked and abbreviated name PBEWithSHA1AndDESede and the OID as a synonym (the latter not documented AFAICS). 
OTOH IBM apparently implements the four other PKCS12 schemes, based on RC2 and RC4, using the standard spellings plus variants PBEWith{SHA,SHA-1,SHA1}And{40,128}Bit{RC2-CBC,RC4} (and no OIDs?) whereas Oracle-and-OpenJDK 8+ uses PBEWithSHA1AND{RC2,RC4}_{40,128} and the corresponding OIDs.

openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform DER -in key.pem -nocrypt -out key.der

I have a question that pops up occusionally.
I am trying to debug some jdk apis using eclipse.
I have tried:
1) Using the jre inside jdk (containing the jdk src) as the jre to use
2) Adding the jdk src as a separate project and add reference from my project to the jdk project.
I started debugging.
I got into the jdk code but only up to a certain point.
Then I got the ""Attach Source"" editor.
The part of code I am trying to debug is part of java's pkix apis that uses the JCE provider architecture.
So for example I do 
Certificate generateCertificate(fin);//I go into the code

then I step into 
return certFacSpi.engineGenerateCertificate(inStream);

And I get ""Source Not Found Editor""
I see that the class called is:  
public class sun.security.provider.X509Factory extends java.security.cert.CertificateFactorySpi

But I can not seem to find the package sun.security.provider in the jdk src.
Isn't all src available from SUN? Am I doing something wrong in my environment setup?  
Any input is highly welcome  
","The full source code is distributed as separate jar file, but it's a little bit outdated (6u23): http://download.java.net/jdk6/source/
But you can also download the openjdk sources, that contain also the source of the sun specific classes.

"39173676","Java Create KeyPair hangs on VM but works on physical system","I have some Java code which is creating a KeyPair using JCS and Bouncey Castle.  When I create a keypair on a physical Linux system like my desktop it works fine.  The key generation takes a second or two.  When I run the same code on a VM the key gen usually ""hangs"" (I leave it running for up to 5 minutes).  Sometimes it works in under 30 seconds but that's rare.
I'm guessing that this has something to do with not enough randomness being available on the VM, but I don't know how to work around this.
Here is the test code which is pulled from my actual program code and condensed:
import java.security.KeyPair;
import java.security.KeyPairGenerator;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.security.SecureRandom;

public class KeyPairCreateTester {
    private static final String RANDOM_ALGO = ""SHA1PRNG"";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final String keyAlgo = ""RSA"";
        final int keySize = 2048;

        try {
            System.out.printf(""Creating random instance using %s\n"", RANDOM_ALGO);
            SecureRandom random = SecureRandom.getInstance(RANDOM_ALGO);
            System.out.printf(""Creating key using algo %s size %d\n"", keyAlgo, keySize);
            KeyPairGenerator keygen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(keyAlgo);
            System.out.printf(""Initialize\n"");
            keygen.initialize(keySize, random);
            System.out.printf(""Generating key\n"");
            KeyPair keyPair = keygen.generateKeyPair();
            System.out.println(""Success"");
        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
            System.err.println(""No such algo"");
        }
    }

}

The ""hang"" occurs after ""Generating key"".
Adjusting the keySize down to even 512 has only minimal effect.  At 512 the key is generated a few times more often but it still hangs most of the time for at least 5 minutes.
The physical machine and the VM are both Ubuntu 16.04.
Java is 1.8.0_72 + 1.8.0_101 (I tried both).
Would REALLY appreciate some pointers on this one.  It's driving me crazy!

"48337425","Dynamically detect signature algorithms in JCE","My application is on Java 7. I want to digitally verify a signed message sent by a calling system.
My problem is, I don't know the signature algorithm that has been used in the calling system.
In the runtime in JCE, how can I detect the signature algorithm to verify?
All the examples I have seen have the algorithm is pre-known or hardcoded
https://www.mkyong.com/java/java-digital-signatures-example/
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/security/apisign/index.html
I am using Sun provided JCE implementation and cannot use any third party providers like Bouncy Castle.
I can do ASN parsing to detect the OID of the algorithm but again AFAIK JCE does not have any ways to detect the algorithm by passing the OID in java 7.
Please check here for that Fetching MessageDigest by OID is failing in Java 7
","You could extract the algorithm OID from signed message, but this is generally not the right way to solve your issue, because you have to deal with all the possibilities and the code will be too complex

Padding algorithm: PSS, PKCS#1, etc
Key algorithm: RSA, EC, DSA
Hashing algorithm: SHA1, SHA256, etc.

In the usual signature formats: XMLDsig, CMS, PAdES, JWS the signature algorithm is included in the signature container as an attribute
See this XMLDsig example using DSA with SHA1

So, I suggest to include the signature algorithm in the message sent by calling system. For example in JWS signature is included a header like this {""alg"":""RS256""}

Of course if you are working with a limited set of keys and algorithms (i.e RSA-PKCS#1 with SHA) you could extract the OID from the signature decrypting the message and parsing the ASN.1

"34872233","Encrypt/Decyrypt - Cipher - JceSecurity Restriction","I am trying to encrypt/decrypt the data using javax.crypto.Ciper where I have given transformation as AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding.
My problem is when I run the code in Local machine, encryption / decryption works fine, however when I run the same code on Server, system throws Exception during Cipher.init(""AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding"").
On doing detailed analysis and checking the code inside Cipher.java, I found the problem is inside the following method Cipher-initCryptoPermission() when system checks for JceSecurity.isRestricted().
In my local machine, JceSecurity.isRestricted() returns FALSE, however when it runs on Server, the same method returns TRUE. Due to this on server, the system does not assigns right permissions to the Cipher.
Not sure, where exactly JceSecurity restriction is set. Appreciate your help. 
","On doing deep-diving I found the real problem and solution.
Under Java_home/jre/lib/security there are two jar files, local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar. Inside local_policy.jar, there is a file called default_local.policy, which actually stores all the permissions of the cryptography.
In my local machine the file had AllPermission, hence there were no Restriction in JceSecurity for me and was allowing me to use AES encryption algorithm, but on the server it is having limited version as provided by Java bundle.
Replacing the local_policy.jar with no restrictions (or unlimited permissions) did the trick. 
On reading more about it on Internet found that Java provides the restricted version with the download package as some countries have restrictions on using the type of cyptography algorithms, hence you must check with your organisation before replacing the jar files.
Jar files with no restrictions can be found on Oracle (Java) site at following location.Download link

"53851339","How to debug code without debug information?","I come across unintended behavior while using the BouncyCastle Provider with the JCE. 
I thus want to see whats happening inside and have to debug the code of the BouncyCastle Library. Sadly the classes I have to take a look into (XMSSMTKeyFactorySpi) seem to be compiled without debugging information as both the local variable info and line numbers are missing.
I already thought of building it myself and including the debug information, however this does not work as the BouncyCastle provider is a Security provider for the JCE and has to be signed in order to be used with JCE. (Which I have to do as the error only occurs when using BC with JCE)
So how can I debug the code in question without debugging information being included to the .class?
Is there even a way of doing so? 
One solution would be to rebuild the BC provider and send it to Oracle to get signed as described here, but I kinda don't want to do this. At least not if there is another way.

Edit: to debug the BC Provider code one can simply take one from Providers with debug, thank you @JamesKPolk

"47423230","Why does Lambda generate identical cryptographic keys after initialization and how to fix it?","I've noticed something weird when generating key pairs from AWS Lambda - every time I run the code it generates identical keys. I am aware that Lambda containers are frozen after each invocation and this is probably why the underlying JCE classes are loaded from memory and keep their initial state. The code in question is relatively simple:
KeyPairGenerator keyPairGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"", ""BC"");
keyPairGen.initialize(2048);
KeyPair keyPair = keyPairGen.generateKeyPair();
RSAPublicKey rsaPublicKey = (RSAPublicKey) keyPair.getPublic();
RSAPrivateKey rsaPrivateKey = (RSAPrivateKey) keyPair.getPrivate();

return new RSAKey.Builder(rsaPublicKey).privateKey(rsaPrivateKey)
            .keyID(kid).keyUse(KeyUse.SIGNATURE)

I tried both the vanilla provider and Bouncy Castle but the result is the same - identical key pairs when Lambda is ""warm"". Once the container is terminated and restarted from a ""cold"" state, I get a new and different set of keys.
I'm also using AWS Cognito and the service is served through both API Gateway and CloudFront.
Any ideas how to ""refresh"" the underlying JCE classes?
","To answer my own question, the culprit was actually CloudFront. Even with API caching turned off in API Gateway, CloudFront still caches the responses for some API requests.
If someone comes across the same problem, the solution is to ""bust"" the CloudFront cache by appending a query parameter to the request URL:
GET /api/generateKeyPair?timestamp=1507843759370

"57265305","HSM decryption + encryption chaining","My application is acting as a switchboard to transfer very sensitive messages between two parties and I'm trying to figure out how I can do this without ""looking"" at the message they're trying to send. 
I have a HSM, and I've generated a keypair for the sender - they're going to encrypt the message with their public key that I gave them, and I can decrypt the message using the private key I have in the HSM. 
I'm going to then pass that message on by encrypting it with the public key of the ultimate receiver, which I have. 
Is there any way to chain these two operations inside the HSM, without having the decrypted message anywhere near my application memory? I would like the plaintext content to never leave the boundaries of the HSM.
I know that some HSMs have a CodeSafe / SEE machine feature that lets me write embedded system code and run it inside the HSM, before I get into that I'd like to see if there's a way using the general PKCS / JCE / CNG APIs to do this safely.
","If all you need is to re-encrypt the same secret under a different key, you can use C_Unwrap to create a temporal HSM object with value of the translated secret and then use C_Wrap to encrypt the value of this temporal HSM object for all the recipients.
This way the secret will never leave HSM.
Something like this (verified to be working on SafeNet Luna 7 with RSA-OAEP):
// Your private key for 'decrypting' secret. Must have key unwrapping allowed
CK_OBJECT_HANDLE hsmPrivateKey = ... ;

// Encrypted secret
byte[] wrappedKey = ... ; // 

// Template for temporal generic secret key with value of the secret

        new CK_ATTRIBUTE(CKA.CLASS, CKO.SECRET_KEY),
        new CK_ATTRIBUTE(CKA.KEY_TYPE, CKK.GENERIC_SECRET),
        new CK_ATTRIBUTE(CKA.TOKEN, false),
        new CK_ATTRIBUTE(CKA.PRIVATE, true),
        new CK_ATTRIBUTE(CKA.EXTRACTABLE, true),
        new CK_ATTRIBUTE(CKA.SENSITIVE, true),
        new CK_ATTRIBUTE(CKA.ENCRYPT, false),
        new CK_ATTRIBUTE(CKA.DECRYPT, false),
        new CK_ATTRIBUTE(CKA.WRAP, false),
        new CK_ATTRIBUTE(CKA.UNWRAP, false),
        new CK_ATTRIBUTE(CKA.SIGN, false),
        new CK_ATTRIBUTE(CKA.VERIFY, false),
        new CK_ATTRIBUTE(CKA.DERIVE, false)
};

// Unwrapping/decryption mechanism
CK_MECHANISM mechanism = ... ;

// Handle for temporal generic secret key with value of the secret
CK_OBJECT_HANDLE temporalValueHandle = new CK_OBJECT_HANDLE();

// Unwrap/decrypt the secret into temporal key
CryptokiEx.C_UnwrapKey(session, mechanism, hsmPrivateKey, wrappedKey, wrappedKey.length, tempTemplate, tempTemplate.length, temporalValueHandle);

// Wrap/encrypt the secret for recipients. Recipient public keys must have key wrapping allowed
for(CK_OBJECT_HANDLE recipientPublicKey : ... ) {
    LongRef resSize = new LongRef(0);
    CryptokiEx.C_WrapKey(session, mechanism, recipientPublicKey, temporalValueHandle, null, resSize);
    byte[] rewrappedKey = new byte[CryptokiUtils.safeIntCast(resSize.value)];
    CryptokiEx.C_WrapKey(session, mechanism, recipientPublicKey, temporalValueHandle, rewrappedKey, resSize);
    System.out.println(""Re-wrapped key: "" + bytesToHexString(rewrappedKey));
}

","Turns out you have to add keys in the cas.properties for the TGC encryption:
# The encryption secret key. By default, must be a octet string of size 256.
tgc.encryption.key=***

# The signing secret key. By default, must be a octet string of size 512.
tgc.signing.key=***

In order to get keys use this tool.
Here is the reference in the CAS 4.2.x documentation.
It mentioned that the CAS server will automatically generate keys for the TGC if not set before, but I couldn't find them in my console so I used the mentioned tool. Don't forget to choose oct as the key type.

The attribute gets eliminated no matter what.
If I disable all editors the attribute remains but I need the editors active.
Any help?

","My guess is that your keyText is Base64 encoded. You should probably decode it to get a byte[] of 32 bytes. In Java 8 you can do something like this:
byte[] key = java.util.Base64.getDecoder().decode(keyText.getBytes());
SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(key, ""DES"");

byte[] tokenData = des.doFinal(Base64.decodeBase64(token));

This other question has more information about Base64. Converting Secret Key into a String and Vice Versa
I still think you will get invalid key size errors though. Isn't a DES key 56 bits (plus 8 parity bits)? So that would only be 8 bytes long not 44 or the 32 I think you will get when you decode Base64.

","DES has a key size of 56-bits in 8-bytes, the lsb of each byte is reserved for parity but is generally ignored.
So ""My key size is 44 bytes"" is incorrect.
Next is the IV used for decryption must be the same as was used for encryption. DES has a block size of 8-bytes so the IV needs to be 8-bytes. One general way of handling the IV is so prefix the encrypted data with it, the IV does not need to be secret.
Finally, zero padding is not generally a good solution, it does not support binary data that may end with a zero byte. PKCS#5 is the generally used padding.

I am aware of the need to install extended JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy files for some cryptographic operations, as noted here.
My question is, when these jars are not installed, why does encryption throw the same exception while decryption does not?
","The key type, size and platform (the JRE or JDK version) are all required knowledge to see if you require the unlimited crypto files. These files depend on a policy set by Oracle to comply with specific import regulations. Some ciphers + key sizes are free for use and others are not. Which ones are allowed and which ones are not depends on politics rather than technical reasoning.
It does not matter if you are using encryption or decryption. Decryption can be used for encryption in certain modes of encryption, such as CTR mode encryption.

In your particular case an RSA key of 2048 bits has a lot less strenght than an AES key of 256 bits. So it is not so strange that one part of your code throws an exception and the other part doesn't. The use of AES keys of 192 or 256 bits is precluded unless you have the unlimited strength files for Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_45-b18).

","You should create a template override for the view, in that you can place the link to edit adding:

to the url so that only the component part will be shown; and add the

the pfx is installed in user local store correctly, because i used it in c# and it worked many times. 
in the java code above also, when i use pfx directly instead of SunMSCAPI provider, it works:
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(""pkcs12"");

ks.load(pfxStream, pfxPassword.toCharArray());

kmf.init(ks, pfxPassword.toCharArray());

","It looks like the issue was that there is many certificates in my localstore and according to my research KeyManager selects the first Key found that meet the criteria, meaning that it will not necessarily pick my certificate among them. i solved this issue, by creating a decorator over X509KeyManager that chooses my desired certificate alias. got the idea from this QA:

As per my research I would need a SSL certificate (pair of keys private and public). I have got to know how to generate a certificate using Bouncy Castle library. 
My questions are:

What I assume is that, in the server side the certificate must contain both private and, public key and in the client side the certificate must contain only the public key of the server. Is this correct?
If the above understanding is correct, how should I generate two certificates, one for server using both public and private key 
and the other one for client by only public key. 

can some one give me some directions on this?
","There are several resources online explaining very well how public-key crypto works.  Generally, your server has two resources: a private key and a certificate.  The public key is contained in the certificate. Usually the private key is protected with a password, so your server will also need that.
The certificate is sent to the client upon connection; but the client needs to trust it.  For that to happen, either the certificate needs to be signed by a trusted authority, or you need to explicitly trust that certificate in the client (the latter case is referred to as a self-signed certificate).
Bouncy castle is a library for these kind of things, but you can use anything for creating your keypair.  The most obvious one is keytool, which comes which java. read up on generating your keypair here.

","Different major versions have different directories so adding JRE 8 will not touch JRE 7.
What happens exactly depends on your installer.  If you use the tar.gz package it will create a new directory for every build, if you use RPM it will remove the old versions and add new ones.  You need to check how RPM behaves if you modify a file, but I would assume it could be overwritten.

","If you are willing to make a jar and use a wrapper for each program, you can bundle a specific jre with each executable.

Download and run Launch4j
In your eclipse project, click on:
File -> export -> runnable jar file -> next
And select the run configuration for the project you'd like to extract. Hit Finish
It's a good idea to test each jar and make sure it runs. Double click, or find it with cmd and do java -jar nameOfJarToTest.jar.
Make a subfolder for your jre. I just called mine ""jre"". 
Copy and paste your bin and lib folders from the correct jre into that folder you just made. Mine are located in a place like C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_201 if you wanted to run java 8. To be extra clear, your file structure should be 


someContainerFolder(folder you just made)
  nameOfJarToTest.jar

  jre(folder you just made)

        bin(folder copied from the jre in your file system)

        lib(folder copied from the jre in your file system)



Run Launch4j. Add the .jar and select an output file path. Fields pictured below 

Click on the jre tab and add your respective jre in the min jre field. Make sure you select the option Only use private jdk runtimes. Type ""jre""(if you named the folder with 'bin' and 'lib' jre) in the ""bundled jre path"" field pictured below.



Click on 'build wrapper'. It looks like a settings cog. 


If you do this for both jar files, and make sure the 'bin' and 'lib' folders are from the jre you want to run, the two programs will both run fine in different runtime environments. If you would like one program to be able to call the other, I found the geeksforgeeks website has a very simple and concise way for you to call external executable files from your code if you're okay with canonical paths.

https://stackoverflow.com/a/13238132
In my scenario:
System.out.println(Cipher.getMaxAllowedKeyLength(""AES""));

return 
2147483647

What's wrong?
Why this environment doesn't work correctly?
I'm working with jdk1.8.144 in 32bit version.
And Eclipse Oxygen.3a Release (4.7.3a)
","I found an answer. It wasn't problem with neither JDK nor Eclipse. Simple answer is:

In our code there is java.home variable assigned to custom value.

Explanation:
Variable java.home points to Java installation directory as said in documentation of System.getProperties(). It is always available.
In normal scenario value of this variable is inferred from JAVA_HOME system variable.
More interesting reading here on SO.
But because of some strange configuration of our computers somebody made a decision to set it manually for local test environment. 
And it worked until JDK migration when JDK path has changed. 
Hints for others:
After JDK upgrade when you are using Eclipse there are several places to check configuration:

Preferences -> Java -> Installed JRE
Project properties -> Java Build Path -> JRE System Library
Project properties -> Java Compiler
Run Configuration (for example for Maven build run) -> JRE
Check System.getenv() variables if any has strange value.

generally we can create key-store file in this way,
keytool -genseckey -keystore <filename>.jceks -storetype jceks -storepass <passwrod> -keyalg AES -keysize 256 -alias <alias name> -keypass <key password>

here, only one person has access to key-store file and keys, also that person can access that file without getting any others support. So only one have full permission.

"26916758","Storing persistent encryption keys","Sensitive information stored in our database is stored encrypted.
My application needs a single global AES 256 encryption key. My boss suggests using the same key stored in a certificate used for our SSL. Mind you this application is not SSL related.
I'm wondering if this is a good idea? Maybe we should store a separate key in a database or in the Java backend code itself?
I hear SSL uses a variety of encryption methods and so the key used by SSL may not be compatible with the encryption we use, which is always AES 256?
Help appreciated
","Try storing it in a JCEKS key store instead. Key stores can be used to store keys. Note that you would need to protect it with a relatively strong pass phrase. It's tricky to automate access to a key.
Understanding how you can manage keys is called key management, and it is the topic of entire books.

EDIT 1 I've added additional stacktrace - please check
","The clue is in last cause in your stack trace:
Caused by: java.lang.SecurityException: Can't read cryptographic policy directory: unlimited
down the rabit hole:

Verify where your security policies are coming from by inspecting  java.security.properties from within running JVM:
System.getProperty(""java.security.properties"");

It should be present and pointing at a file. Inspect that file and make sure it has the following property crypto.policy=unlimited and the folder called unlimited is available from where the policy file is. The policy file itself should explain where to look for this folder.
For Coretto it is <jre_home>/conf/security/policy/

You can modify the location of the security policy by starting your JVM and passing it the location of the policy file: java -Djava.security.properties==/conf/security/java.security
ORjava -Djava.security.properties=/conf/security/java.security
Additional =sign in the first case will cause Java to use only properties in the file you pointing at. The second option will add / update the properties defined in the file.

Lastly you have to dig around your Correto 11 to find the policy file.

","An IllegalBlockSizeException occurs when the input data is not a multiple of the block-size (16 bytes in the case of AES).
This problem has been caused by your method of reading the decrypted data. As explained in the comments by Jesper and JB Nizet, encrypted data is unreadable as text. Trying to read it as a string (regardless of character set) isn't going to work.
So... ensure you are writing your file to disk as a byte stream and read it in the same manner. This should ensure you have exactly the right data (which will be the right length).
I'd recommend something like Apache commons-lang FileUtils.writeByteArrayToFile and FileUtils.readFileToByteArray, or write your own with the Java IO libraries.

I have been asked to implement a component for decrypt java.lang.String. The encrypted string is part of webservice response which we integrate with.
Webservice provider has provided to us with a binary file to be used to decrypt. 

ProviderDESedeWebservice.key. 

They also informed the alogirthm:

String comes encoded in 64Base. So we have to decode it before to decrypt.
Once decrypted, I should get a xml message

Key file (ProviderDESedeWebservice.key) is going to be in the classpath. At the moment I placed it at resources folder.

Issue
Executing decrypt() java throws an error:

java.security.InvalidKeyException: Invalid key length: 46 bytes

Ok I have understood that DESede keys can not be longer than 24 bytes.
So I have tried this approach at the time of generating the key
...
try {                               
        SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""DESede"");  
        SecretKey key = factory.generateSecret(new DESedeKeySpec(scretKeyByteArr));
        return key; 
} catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();    
}
return null;

Now Java throws:

javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Given final block not properly padded

I kept trying different approachs and my next tried has benn to change the algorithm
Cipher desCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""DESede/CBC/NoPadding"");

Finally I get a binary that looks like this 

Decrypted message:�.B
  ���;����[�׮��u85�I���@M���㦬�����E��+S���^

But I have expected to get an XML.
Question
I think the question is obvious.

What am I doing wrong?
Do am I loading properly the key file?
-- Answer:Yes. Problem is not here
Do am I decoding properly the input string?
-- Answer:Yes. Problem is not here
Could secret key file be corrupted? Malformed?
-- Answer:No. But it might not be the one I need

EDIT:
I have tested that web services encrypted responses can not be decrypted with the key we have. Key or algorithm might be modified by reasons why dont know and we were not aware of it

","Yes, it does. And no, it doesn't.
AES-NI is used through Java intrinsics, which replaces byte code by the native implementation of AES. So although you won't find a direct call to the AES-NI instructions, the doFinal call in your Java code will at some point use hardware acceleration. So the code of the JCE is just Java, but the JIT can still speed it up. Nifty, huh?
To really test your code you may want to use a warm up time for the JIT (to enable the AES-NI as well). You should be able to use a buffer instead of generating a new array object each time for the ciphertext.
More importantly, might want to catch the output of that buffer and e.g. XOR it into a final buffer and print it out. This will make it next to impossible for the compiler to skip the code altogether. Compiler optimizations are tricky to handle if you're not really interested in the results themselves; the compiler or JIT may just skip the encryption altogether to obtain the same result, after all.
You probably need more AES operations in a single loop too. You could implement the Monte Carlo testing required for the AES competition as a base.

","You are not using the same IV for both encryption and decryption.
From the comment that the decryption starts: ""the first line is ""çQßs}@ LÂ¤qMä]this is a test"" that would mean the IV for encryption and decryption is not the same.
This comment says it all:  
//Save the IV bytes or send it in plaintext with the encrypted data so you can decrypt the data later
Either:

save the IV by returning it from the encryption and passing it in on decryption

or

prefix the encrypted data with the IV and on decryption split it off to use for decryption. (The IV does not need to be secret)

More on the IV and CBC mode, see Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):
While the IV influences the entire encrypted data CBC mode is self correcting and this means only the first block is incorrect when the wrong IV is used on decryption.

So i went to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html. To get the java cryptography extension.  
I downloaded the extension and and compressed it.  At this point I am expecting to be able to get past the **high-encryption ** error that was blocking me.

Unfortunately,  I am still getting the same error from above.  Not sure what else I need to do to get this working. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

Depends on your application
Yes.  Different ciphers may use different key lengths.  You pass AlgorithmParameterSpec to the key generator.

"24120640","Symmetric Key Generation","I have two questions:

When to use SecretKeySpec and when to use KeyGenerator for key generation?
Is it necessary that the Key instance and the Cipher instance has to follow the same Algorithm? What is the concept behind?

","KeyGenerator creates a new random key each time it is called. The returned key is also guaranteed to have the length compatible with the algorithm specified when obtaining the KeyGenerator instance.
SecretKeySpec wraps an existing byte array. The source of bytes can be a hex or Base64 string or really any other textual or binary representation of the previously generated key. Hence the use case for SecretKeySpec is when you need to reuse the key which was previously stored in some external representation.
Usually an instance of SecretKeySpec can be used directly as a key because SecretKeySpec implements SecretKey and most crypto algorithms that use secret keys support so-called ""raw"" keys where the ""raw"" key is basically a random sequence of bytes without specific internal structure.
When an algorithm requires a specific SecretKey representation (usually a subclass of SecretKey internal to algorithm implementation) you will have to use SecretKeyFactory to transform a SecretKeySpec into a proper SecretKey.
If a crypto algorithm supports ""raw"" keys then the only requirement is that the key length matches the algorithm expectations.
But the implementer of crypto provider can decide that he needs to use a specific key representation which, for example, caches or precalculates some values based on the initial ""raw"" bytes. In that case the algorithm can require that a SecretKey instance passed into in addition to returning correct identifiers from Key.getAlgorithm() and Key.getFormat() methods is also a specific subclass of SecretKey, so the usage of SecretKeyFactory to convert key spec into a key is mandatory. Such cases are usually documented in the provider documentation.

","Note: This is going to be a bit of an unorthodox answer, and might not be exactly what the OP is looking for. 
One possible solution is to zip the files in your folder, and then encrypt the zip file. 
Reading its contents will be slower of course, but is perfectly feasible with Java's NIO Zip File system provider. You will need to decrypt it back so that it is back to zip format.

","If you mean ""Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files"" with JCE, then you cannot achieve what you need with any kind of packaging. These policy files need to be installed to the running JVM, and thus you cannot solve this problem either programmatically or via different packaging options.
To achieve what you need, you have to use BC throgh their own API, rather then calling JCE functions and specifying ""BC"" as the provider since it will fail because of policy/security checks. You can walk around this check only by using BC API (or any other crypto library) directly.

As you see, signatures are completely different, even though I use the same private key. What is wrong with my code? I just don't get it.

"54407921","Is there some way to have access to server port from SSLEngine for my custom provider?","Im setting up my own jce provider and already have a working setup already by extending SPI/engine classes
I was using Http1Protocol and I was able to retrieve the alias (Im using the port as an ALIAS ) via keyManager.chooseServerAlias(keyType, principal[], socket) since it has socket param with it
But when I changed it to Http11NioProtocol, it now uses chooseEngineServerAlias to retrieve the alias and unfortunately keymanager doesnt have access to socket which Im using as a reference for retrieving the port/alias,
Please advise
I have checked ServerHandshaker.setupPrivateKeyAndChain and it has the following implementation on retrieving the engine
    if(this.conn != null) {
            var3 = var2.chooseServerAlias(var1, (Principal[])null, this.conn);
        } else {
            var3 = var2.chooseEngineServerAlias(var1, (Principal[])null, this.engine);
        }

Based on my understanding, when using NIO protocols, it will use SSLEngine, but when using the IO protocol, it uses the SSLSocket. seems I will be using NioProtocol connector on my tomcat, I am now unable to have the reference for the port number.

"57503329","Does SSLSocket.startHandshake include certificate verification and hostname verification for SSLSocket?","From the security guide https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-ssl.html#CommonHostnameProbs, when an SSLSocket is used seperated from the HttpsUrlConnection, hostname verification is required manually by invoking the hostnameverifier.verify() method:
// Open SSLSocket directly to gmail.com
SocketFactory sf = SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) sf.createSocket(""gmail.com"", 443);
HostnameVerifier hv = HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier();
SSLSession s = socket.getSession();


// Verify that the certicate hostname is for mail.google.com
// This is due to lack of SNI support in the current SSLSocket.
if (!hv.verify(""mail.google.com"", s)) {
    throw new SSLHandshakeException(""Expected mail.google.com, ""
                                    ""found "" + s.getPeerPrincipal());
}

// At this point SSLSocket performed certificate verification and
// we have performed hostname verification, so it is safe to proceed.

// ... use socket ...
socket.close();

But I also see secure code examples says:
/*
 * This example demostrates how to use a SSLSocket as client to
 * send a HTTP request and get response from an HTTPS server.
 * It assumes that the client is not behind a firewall
 */

public class SSLSocketClient {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        try {
            SSLSocketFactory factory =
                (SSLSocketFactory)SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
            SSLSocket socket =
                (SSLSocket)factory.createSocket(""www.verisign.com"", 443);

            /*
             * send http request
             *
             * Before any application data is sent or received, the

             *
             * SSL handshaking can be initiated by either flushing data

             *
             * Handshaking is started manually in this example because
             * PrintWriter catches all IOExceptions (including

             * Unfortunately, this means any error messages are lost,

             * PrintWriter.checkError().
             */
            socket.startHandshake();

            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(
                                  new BufferedWriter(
                                  new OutputStreamWriter(
                                  socket.getOutputStream())));

            out.println(""GET / HTTP/1.0"");
            out.println();
            out.flush();

            /*
             * Make sure there were no surprises
             */
            if (out.checkError())
                System.out.println(
                    ""SSLSocketClient:  java.io.PrintWriter error"");

            /* read response */
            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(
                                    new InputStreamReader(
                                    socket.getInputStream()));

            String inputLine;
            while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null)
                System.out.println(inputLine);

            in.close();
            out.close();
            socket.close();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Whether it is secure? I didn't see any hostname verify method is called before the read/write behavior of this socket. Does the socket.startHandShake() includes it?
