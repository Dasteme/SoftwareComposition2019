","The encryption methods described are symmetric key block ciphers.
Data Encryption Standard (DES) is the predecessor, encrypting data in 64-bit blocks using a 56 bit key. Each block is encrypted in isolation, which is a security vulnerability.
Triple DES extends the key length of DES by applying three DES operations on each block: an encryption with key 0, a decryption with key 1 and an encryption with key 2. These keys may be related.
DES and 3DES are usually encountered when interfacing with legacy commercial products and services.
AES is considered the successor and modern standard. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard
I believe the use of Blowfish is discouraged.
It is highly recommended that you do not attempt to implement your own cryptography and instead use a high-level implementation such as GPG for data at rest or SSL/TLS for data in transit. Here is an excellent and sobering video on encryption vulnerabilities http://rdist.root.org/2009/08/06/google-tech-talk-on-common-crypto-flaws/

","Use AES.
In more details:

DES is the old ""data encryption standard"" from the seventies. Its key size is too short for proper security (56 effective bits; this can be brute-forced, as has been demonstrated more than ten years ago). Also, DES uses 64-bit blocks, which raises some potential issues when encrypting several gigabytes of data with the same key (a gigabyte is not that big nowadays).
3DES is a trick to reuse DES implementations, by cascading three instances of DES (with distinct keys). 3DES is believed to be secure up to at least ""2112"" security (which is quite a lot, and quite far in the realm of ""not breakable with today's technology""). But it is slow, especially in software (DES was designed for efficient hardware implementation, but it sucks in software; and 3DES sucks three times as much).
Blowfish is a block cipher proposed by Bruce Schneier, and deployed in some softwares. Blowfish can use huge keys and is believed secure, except with regards to its block size, which is 64 bits, just like DES and 3DES. Blowfish is efficient in software, at least on some software platforms (it uses key-dependent lookup tables, hence performance depends on how the platform handles memory and caches).
AES is the successor of DES as standard symmetric encryption algorithm for US federal organizations (and as standard for pretty much everybody else, too). AES accepts keys of 128, 192 or 256 bits (128 bits is already very unbreakable), uses 128-bit blocks (so no issue there), and is efficient in both software and hardware. It was selected through an open competition involving hundreds of cryptographers during several years. Basically, you cannot have better than that.

So, when in doubt, use AES.
Note that a block cipher is a box which encrypts ""blocks"" (128-bit chunks of data with AES). When encrypting a ""message"" which may be longer than 128 bits, the message must be split into blocks, and the actual way you do the split is called the mode of operation or ""chaining"". The naive mode (simple split) is called ECB and has issues. Using a block cipher properly is not easy, and it is more important than selecting between, e.g., AES or 3DES.

"5554526","Comparison of DES, Triple DES, AES, blowfish encryption for data","Does anyone have pros and cons together for comparing these encryption algorithms ?
","AES is a symmetric cryptographic algorithm, while RSA is an asymmetric (or public key) cryptographic algorithm. Encryption and decryption is done with a single key in AES, while you use separate keys (public and private keys) in RSA. The strength of a 128-bit AES key is roughly equivalent to 2600-bits RSA key.

","Although TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider is a safe and good method but it's too slow. If you want to refer to MSDN you will get that advise you to use AES rather TripleDES. Please check below link:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.tripledescryptoserviceprovider.aspx
you will see this attention in the remark section:

Note 
  A newer symmetric encryption algorithm, Advanced Encryption
  Standard (AES), is available. Consider using the
  AesCryptoServiceProvider class instead of the
  TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider class. Use
  TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider only for compatibility with legacy
  applications and data.

Good luck

","Encryption algorithms work on raw bytes, not characters.
The reason you couldn't handle accented characters was because the code you were using to convert the characters to and from raw bytes didn't handle Unicode.
You should use AES; for an example of how to use it in Java, see here.  
EDIT: Right now, you might just be hiding it from curious eyes, but there's no telling what the future will hold, and it is always much better to use strong encryption now and not find out, to late, that you should have but didn't.

","The input length it's referring to is the length of your ciphertext (strToBeDecrypted), which it expects to be a multiple of the block size. It is implied that by default the library is expecting your input to be padded.
That means either you either need to set the padding to 'none' when decrypting (as that was the 'padding' used when encrypting) or you've corrupted the ciphertext somehow.
Try changing ""DES"" to ""DES/ECB/NoPadding"". I don't know what the default cipher mode is for your implementation, but it's typically ""ECB"" or ""CBC"". If neither of those two work then you're corrupting your ciphertext somewhere along the line.

You are doing the right thing, your problem is just that the SunJCE Java cryptography provider doesn't support AES for password-based encryption.  You need to use an alternative provider which does: for example, you could use the Bouncy Castle provider with the algorithm ""PBEWITHSHA256AND128BITAES-CBC-BC"".  (Despite the whimsical name, Bouncy Castle is well-respected).
As for ""is DES secure enough for my data"", well if the data you're protecting would be worth less than roughly $10,000 to an attacker, then back in 2009 it was probably just secure enough.  And in 2014, if your data is worth encrypting at all, the answer is no.

","EDIT: @David Koontz replied to this post, and I had a chance to look 5 years into the past. I'm leaving my post intact below, but for anyone reading this now, avoid 3DES if you have the opportunity, and if not, get an expert to look at your specific system. There's no guarantee that a general answer will apply to your situation, in computer security especially.
Yes.
3DES is broken, but when a cryptographer says ""broken,"" that means something very specific: that an attacker can break the key in better-than-brute-force time. 3DES has a key length of 168 bits, which is reduced to 112 bits by some meet-in-the-middle attack cleverness. And, to quote Wikipedia, ""it is designated by NIST to have only 80 bits of security.""
It's pretty badly broken, but even so, 80 bits makes for a very big number; 3DES is plenty good for beating people with fewer resources than the NSA, for example, and it will be for maybe 10 or 15 years, with some luck. The incentive to replace 3DES it isn't high enough for a lot of people who aren't using it to protect expensive things.

","I don't exactly know what you want to achieve, but I can at least explain the error you are getting.
DES and 3DES have a block-length of 64 bit. That means you must pass a plaintext which length is a multiple of 64-bits to the encryption-function. To achieve this you usually pad / fill up the last block of the plaintext with data of a certain pattern so that you can easily remove it again after decryption.
In your code you specify the encryption-parameters like this: DESede/ECB/NoPadding 
So you explicitly opt to not automatically apply any padding.

To fix this, just specify a padding mode (for example PKCS5Padding) instead of NoPadding.
Note: The cipher-mode ECB is not secure at all! You should instead better use:
Cipher.getInstance(""DESede/CBC/PKCS5Padding""); // or ""AES"" instead of ""DESede""

(you must provide an additional IV though when using a mode like CBC or CTR)

","DES encryption in ECB mode uses an 8 byte block size, and encodes each blocks individually. The problem is that your input string doesn't divide into 8 bytes equally and the cryptor doesn't know what to do with the final non 8 byte block.
The fix is to allow the cryptor to pad the final block by adding kCCOptionPKCS7Padding to the options to CCCrypt. eg (snippet from an NSData encryption category):
CCCryptorStatus cryptStatus = CCCrypt(kCCEncrypt, 
                                      kCCAlgorithmDES,

            {

","There is two mistakes you have done in your code
you use DESede to create the secret key factory in this line 
 SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""DESede"");

but you use the DES to get the Cipher object. you have to use DESede instead
so use this line 
encryptCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""DESede/CBC/PKCS5Padding""); 
instead of this line 
encryptCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding"");
use the same algorithm to get decripting cipher 
and another one is use a AlgorithmParameterSpec to init the decrypting cipher. 
byte iv[] = encryptCipher.getIV(); 
IvParameterSpec dps = new IvParameterSpec(iv);
decryptCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key, dps);

you can use above code to apply the AlgorithmParameterSpec to the initialization of cipher

","It should be noted that there are (and have always been) questions surrounding the DES algorithm. It's been widely in use for a long time, but since it was originally specified with only a 56 bit key, it's questionable whether it's secure enough for any important uses at this point. Triple DES is generally better, but there are some known theoretical attacks. If you have a choice of cipher, you might want to look at AES instead.

","One-way encryption is a secure form of hashing: the plaintext is changed into an apparently random sequence of data, often of fixed length, in such a way that the original plaintext (theoretically) cannot be retrieved without a brute-force effort.
Two-way encryption, or reversible encryption is what we normally mean by the term encryption: the plaintext is transformed into apparently random data, but in a way that relies on a ""key"" that allows the original plaintext to be retrieved.
DES is a form of reversible encryption that is relatively weak by today's standards, as it relies on a 56-bit key (14 hex characters).  It has been superseded by 3DES, or triple-DES, which is essentially the same algorithm with a longer key.
You don't mention your application, but if you need only to compare the data and not retrieve it, hashing is considered more secure.  For example, you can store hashed passwords; then, when a user authenticates, perform the same hash on the entered text and compare it with the stored hashed value.  If they match, the correct password was entered.
A significant advantage to hashing is that you don't need to store a decryption key.

","I Think you probably mean a one-way function [1]. In cryptography one distinguishes between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. Symmetric cryptography uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt (DES is symmetric). Asymmetric Cryptography is used for key exchange and a public key is used to encrypt the message, while the private key is used to decrypt it. An example of Asymmetric Cryptography is AES [2]. Asymmetric cryptography uses one way functions.

The above code works great. I am able to see the result and everything. But I want to modify it as follows so that i can store the cipherText in a file. Then another program reads the encrypted text from the file and decrypts it. Below is what I have done till now, but I cannot understand how to proceed. Just a little hint on how to proceed will help.
import java.security.*;
import javax.crypto.*;

// encrypt and decrypt using the DES private key algorithm
public class PrivateExample {

  public static void main (String[] args) throws Exception {
    String text=new String();
    text=""This is an encryption test"";

    byte[] plainText = text.getBytes(""UTF8"");

    // get a DES private key
    System.out.println( ""\nStart generating DES key"" );
    KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""DES"");
    keyGen.init(56);
    Key key = keyGen.generateKey();
    System.out.println( ""Finish generating DES key"" );
    //
    // get a DES cipher object and print the provider
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding"");
    System.out.println( ""\n"" + cipher.getProvider().getInfo() );
    //
   // encrypt using the key and the plaintext
    System.out.println( ""\nStart encryption"" );
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
    byte[] cipherText = cipher.doFinal(plainText);
    System.out.println( ""Finish encryption: "" );
    System.out.println( new String(cipherText, ""UTF8"") );

   //Now writing to an ouput file the cipherText
   try{
       FileOutputStream fs=new FileOutputStream(""c:/test.txt"");
      fs.write(cipherText);
     }catch(Exception e){
       e.printStackTrace();
     }
//How to proceed from here

}
}

Now this program's job is complete. It has successfully written the encrypted string into a file. The new program only has to decrypt the data. How do I read the encrypted bytes from the file? The new program obviously has no idea regarding what the original string was, but I will be using the same key as in the algorith. Please help! I am new to encryption
","Here's how you write your key to a file:
        //Write your key to an output file.
        byte[] keyAsByte = key.getEncoded();
        FileOutputStream keyfos = new FileOutputStream(""key.txt"");
        keyfos.write(keyAsByte);
        keyfos.close();

I wouldn't recommend putting the key with the encrypted text in the same file.
Here's how you read the encrypted text and the key back and decrypt:
    //Read your key
    FileInputStream keyFis = new FileInputStream(""key.txt"");
    byte[] encKey = new byte[keyFis.available()];
    keyFis.read(encKey);
    keyFis.close();
    Key keyFromFile = new SecretKeySpec(encKey, ""DES"");
    //Read your text
    FileInputStream encryptedTextFis = new FileInputStream(""test.txt"");
    byte[] encText = new byte[encryptedTextFis.available()];
    encryptedTextFis.read(encText);
    encryptedTextFis.close();
    //Decrypt
    Cipher decrypter = Cipher.getInstance(""DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding"");
    decrypter.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, keyFromFile);
    byte[] decryptedText = decrypter.doFinal(encText);
    //Print result
    System.out.println(""Decrypted Text: "" + new String(decryptedText));

Note: I didn't use the same path as you for writing the information.

","Wikipedia does not say TripleDES supports 56 bit keys. The ""keying options"" talk about ""triple-length"" keys and ""double-length"" keys, the latter ""reduces the key size to 112 bits"".
The effective key size for the original DES is 56 bit. Such a key is constructed from 64 bit input though, where 8 bits remain unused. The ""triple-length"" key option thus works with a three times 56 bit (=168) constructed from three times 64 bit (=192 bit) and the ""double-length"" option works with two times 56 bit keys (=112) constructed from two times 64 bit (=128). 
As your TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider needs to derive the actual keys from the 64 bit-based input first, it will only take either 128 bits (double-length) or 192 bits (triple-length) as input and then internally derive the 168 or 112 bit actual keys from that input.
That's standard procedure for TripleDES, so you should have no problems with portability across platforms.

","I believe some (all?) implementations of DES use only 7 bits per character of the key (ASCII encoding).  I'm not sure if the definition of DES allows for 8-bit characters in keys or if it actually ignores the high bit of each byte.  I think it's the latter.
However, in .NET key sizes are based on the number of bytes, times 8 bits per byte, even if the underlying algorithm ignores that top bit.  That is probably the main discrepancy.
TripleDES runs DES three times with potentially three different 56-bit DES keys.  In some implementations the middle run is reversed (encrypting-decrypting-encrypting or ""EDE"") so that using the same 56-bit DES key for all three duplicates the encryption of simple DES.  This was done for compatibility with older systems where both are using hardware-based encryption.  I'm not sure if the TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider uses this ""EDE"" approach or the ""EEE"" approach (or gives you a choice).  Further, the same 56-bit DES key can be used for the first and third run, using a 112-bit key instead of the 168-bit key it could also use.
The certified TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider wouldn't accept 56-bit (64-bit) keys because it's not really 3DES security (you could use DESCryptoServiceProvider instead?).  At one time it was determined that the 168-bit EEE (or EDE?) 3DES does not provide any greater security than using a 112-bit (128-bit) key.  However, there may be some extreme (generally unavailable) attacks in which the shorter key is theoretically more vulnerable.  That may also apply to the EDE vs EEE question.
On your compatibility vs other languages question, .NET's *CryptoServiceProvider classes are just a wrapper API around the underlying Windows CRYPTO library.  If the other languages are also using the Windows CRYPTO library it should be compatible.  Otherwise, you'd have to find out whether they are using EDE or EEE and make sure all are using the same one (you may or may not have flexibility on that), and obviously use the same key length.  They are probably all using the same byte order, but if you find things still don't match up that might be another thing to check.  Most likely on Windows they're all using CRYPTO and will probably match up as long as you can set the options the same way for all of them.

","Des uses multiples of 64 bit keys, but throws away 8 bits leaving a useful keylength of 64 bits.
Triple des can use double or triple key length.
However because repeating des with the same key decrypts the message running des an even number of times can partially decrypt stuff if the keys share patterns.    
For this reason des is always ran an odd number of times.  
This is also why you should never choose a key where 64 bit parts repeat.
With triple des 192 bit you thus have a effective key length of 112 bits

","Why not just use the included DESede algorithm?
Change all your DES code instances to DESede and change your Key Generation method to as such:
public static SecretKey generateDESkey() {
    KeyGenerator keyGen = null;
    try {
        keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""DESede"");
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException ex) {

    keyGen.init(112); // key length 112 for two keys, 168 for three keys
    SecretKey secretKey = keyGen.generateKey();
    return secretKey;
}

Note how the getInstance() method is now supplied with DESede and the key size has been increased to 112 (168 for three keys).
Change your Cipher instances from:
Cipher.getInstance(""DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding"");

to
Cipher.getInstance(""DESede/ECB/PKCS5Padding"");

"23142363","Convert char or string to bitset in c++","I'm doing an assignment on DES encryption and I can't seem to convert a string, let alone a char into a bitset. Can anyone show me how to convert a single char into a bitset in C++?
","The following:
char c = 'A';
std::bitset<8> b(c);  // implicit cast to unsigned long long

should work.
See http://ideone.com/PtSFvz

Converting an arbitrary-length string to a bitset is harder, if at all possible. The size of a bitset must be known at compile-time, so there's not really a way of converting a string to one.
However, if you know the length of your string at compile-time (or can bound it at compile time), you can do something like:
const size_t N = 50;  // bound on string length
bitset<N * 8> b;
for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); ++i) {
  char c = s[i];
  for (int j = 7; j >= 0 && c; --j) {
    if (c & 0x1) {
      b.set(8 * i + j);
    }
    c >>= 1;
  }
}

That may be a bit inefficient but I don't know if there's a better work-around.

","IV stands for Initialization Vector.

","As per this document, simply pass the cipher a key that is 168 bits long.

Keysize must be equal to 112 or 168. 
A keysize of 112 will generate a Triple DES key with 2 intermediate keys, and a keysize of 168 will generate a Triple DES key with 3 intermediate keys.

Your code seems to do something questionable to make up for the fact that the output of MD5 is only 128 bits long.
Copy-pasting cryptographic code off the internet will not produce secure applications. Using a static IV compromises several reasons why CBC mode is better than ECB. If you are using a static key, you should probably consider generating random bytes using a secure random number generator instead of deriving the key from a short ASCII string. Also, there is absolutely no reason to use Triple DES instead of AES in new applications.

","In principle, the for-next loop to generate the DES ABA key does seem correct. Note that you can provide DESede with a 16 byte key from Java 7 onwards, which amounts to the same thing.
That said, the code you've shown leaves a lot to be desired:
I is not secure:

the key is not generated by a Password Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF) using the (password?) string
the key is composed of two keys instead of three (using a triple DES or TDEA with an ABA key)
the IV is set to all zero's instead of being randomized
the ""password"" string is too short

Furthermore the following code mistakes can be seen:

using new sun.misc.BASE64Encoder() which is in the Sun proprietary packages (which can be removed or changed during any upgrade of the runtime)
throwing Exception for platform exceptions and runtime exceptions (not being able to decrypt is handled the same way as not being able to instantiate the Cipher)
requesting 24 bytes instead of 16 within the Arrays.copyOf() call (which seems to return 24 SHA-1 output while there are only 20 bytes)

To generate a 3DES 24 byte (168 bits used) DES ABC key from a password (like) String you should use PBKDF-2. Adding an authentication tag is also very important if man-in-the-middle attacks or padding oracle  apply. It would be much secure and much more practical to upgrade to AES if you can control the algorithms being used as well.

According to DesFire document, I need two modes of decryption, send and receive. This blog post has some explanation about it. 

However, the DESFire crypto is a bit different from the normal DES/CBC scheme: The PCD uses DES “send mode” when sending data (xor before DES), and the card uses DES “recieve mode” when recieving data (xor after DES). But when the PCD recieves data, it uses normal DES/CBC mode (xor after DES), and the card uses normal DES send mode when sending data (xor before DES).

And in Android side I follow the examples and recommendations:
// connected to tag and application     

// result = encoded(randB) + af 
byte[] result = idTag.transceive(Utils.wrapMessage((byte)0x0a, new byte[]{(byte)0x0}));

byte[] b0 = new byte[8];
for(int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    b0[i] = result[i];
}

// key
byte[] key = new byte[] {(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,
                 (byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,
                 (byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,
                 (byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0 };
byte[][] keys = new byte[3][];
keys[0]=key; keys[1]=key; keys[2]=key;

// decrypt encoded(randB)
byte[] r0 = DES.TripleDES_Decrypt(b0, keys);

// generate randA (integer 0-7 for trying)

for(int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    nr[i] = Byte.parseByte(Integer.toString(i), 16);
}

I get the first result, the encrypted randB. However, the second ""result"" is always ""91ae"", means authentication error. I'm doing something wrong here, send wrong data to card.
Can anyone tell me what must I change in the code to work in these modes? What should I XOR with data before/after TripleDES?
Not the real question, but I read that default ""Key"" in DesFire card is 16 zero bytes. Also the document points that I need to use TripleDES for 16 bytes of key, DES for 8 bytes of key. So I'm using and need to use TripleDES as I haven't changed the default key, am I right? 
For those who need the know about CipherBlockChaining.
EDIT: I found out that I need to do XORing before and after TripleDES and I mustn't touch TripleDES's internal operations at all. I will be trying that in a while. 
Deleted the inner TripleDES lines, just saying for the ones seeing the question for the first time.
","OK I got the solution. My mistake was that I was sending 
3DES(randA + randB') 

But I should send 
3DES(randA) + 3DES(randB' XOR 3DES(randA))

Here's the authentication code for Android/Java (it's so sad that this is the only one that can be found on the net currently!):
The actual authentication code:
// send initial authentication request
byte[] result = idTag.transceive(Utils.wrapMessage((byte)0x0a, new byte[]{(byte)0x0}));

// get encrypted(randB) from the response
byte[] b0 = new byte[8];
for(int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    b0[i] = result[i];
}

// 16 bytes default key
byte[] key = new byte[] {(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,
    (byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,
    (byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,
    (byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0 };
// keys for TripleDes
byte[][] keys = new byte[3][];
keys[0] = key; keys[1] = key; keys[2] = key;

// decrypt encoded(randB)
byte[] r0 = DES.TripleDES_Decrypt(b0, keys);

// generate randA (integer 0-7 for trying, should randomize for real-life use) 
byte[] nr = new byte[8];
for(int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    nr[i] = Byte.parseByte(Integer.toString(i), 16);
}

// decrypt randA, should XOR with IV, but IV is all 0's, not necessary
byte[] b1 = DES.TripleDES_Decrypt(nr, keys);

// shift randB one byte left and get randB'
byte[] r1 =new byte[8];
for(int i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
    r1[i] = r0[i + 1];
}
r1[7]=r0[0];

// xor randB' with randA and decrypt
byte[] b2 = new byte[8];
for(int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    b2[i] = (byte) (b1[i] ^ r1[i]);
}
b2 = DES.TripleDES_Decrypt(b2, keys);

// concat (randA + randB')
byte[] b1b2 = new byte[16];

for (int i = 0; i < b1b2.length; i++) {
    if(i <= 7) {
        b1b2[i] = b1[i];
    } else {
        b1b2[i]=b2[i-8];
    }
}

result = idTag.transceive(Utils.wrapMessage((byte)0xaf, b1b2));

TripleDes is the one in the question. wrapMessage function:
public static byte[] wrapMessage (byte command, byte[] parameters) throws Exception {
    ByteArrayOutputStream stream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

    stream.write((byte) 0x90);
    stream.write(command);
    stream.write((byte) 0x00);
    stream.write((byte) 0x00);
    if (parameters != null) {
        stream.write((byte) parameters.length);
        stream.write(parameters);
    }
    stream.write((byte) 0x00);

    return stream.toByteArray();
}

EDIT: Thanks to VGe0rge, we found out the reason why this authentication doesn't work from time to time. Instead of calling the 3DES function in the question, just call:
Cipher.getInstance(""DESede/CBC/NoPadding"");

According to DesFire document, I need two modes of decryption, send and receive. This blog post has some explanation about it. 

However, the DESFire crypto is a bit different from the normal DES/CBC scheme: The PCD uses DES “send mode” when sending data (xor before DES), and the card uses DES “recieve mode” when recieving data (xor after DES). But when the PCD recieves data, it uses normal DES/CBC mode (xor after DES), and the card uses normal DES send mode when sending data (xor before DES).

And in Android side I follow the examples and recommendations:
// connected to tag and application     

// result = encoded(randB) + af 
byte[] result = idTag.transceive(Utils.wrapMessage((byte)0x0a, new byte[]{(byte)0x0}));

byte[] b0 = new byte[8];
for(int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    b0[i] = result[i];
}

// key
byte[] key = new byte[] {(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,
                 (byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,
                 (byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,
                 (byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0,(byte)0x0 };
byte[][] keys = new byte[3][];
keys[0]=key; keys[1]=key; keys[2]=key;

// decrypt encoded(randB)
byte[] r0 = DES.TripleDES_Decrypt(b0, keys);

// generate randA (integer 0-7 for trying) 
byte[] nr = new byte[8];
for(int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    nr[i] = Byte.parseByte(Integer.toString(i), 16);
}
// decrypt randA
byte[] b1 = DES.TripleDES_Decrypt(nr, keys);

// shift randB and get randB'
byte[] r1 =new byte[8];
for(int i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
    r1[i] = r0[i + 1];
}
r1[7]=r0[0];

// concat (randA + randB')
byte[] b2 = new byte[16];
for(int i = 0; i < 16; i++)
{
    if(i <= 7) {
    b2[i] = b1[i];
} else {
    b2[i] = r1[i - 8];
}
}

As you explained, when sending data to the card: The PCD uses DES “send mode” when sending data (xor before DES), and the card uses DES “recieve mode” when recieving data (xor after DES)

","If you're just looking for obfuscation, XOR with a secret constant is as small an implementation as you will find. It would also be also trivial to break, since its vulnerable to frequency analysis to look for the most common english letters.
If you need a stronger algorithm, I'd recommend looking at blowfish which tends to be small and fast. It does still require memory for tables, but hopefully it will work for your application.
Bruce Schneier explicitly placed the Blowfish algorithm into the public domain, disavowing patents. You can get his implementation in C (and other implementations as well) from his site.  This source does not carry a copyright notice. I suspect that the source code too is in the public domain, but a bit more checking may be necessary.

","The same person that released the C++ DES implementation also released a C Rijndael Encryption Algorithm - I should have poked around his website a bite more, The Tiny Encryption Algorithm (academic paper here) also has a very small C implementation footprint.
Blowfish looks good, and is likely the best of these three as far as security.

","You could use a Pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) to generate a repeatable sequence of words, which you then XOR with the corresponding word in your data stream. (The transmitter and receiver need to know in advance the parameters used to generate the pseudorandom sequence.)
This approach isn't unbreakable, but it's a step up from using a constant for the XOR-ing - and PRNGs are very simple to implement, typically consisting of one multiplication and modulo operation for each word.

... and tried to do it like this:

        int rc9 = Communicate(new byte[] { 0x60 }, ref outb);

outb always contains { 0x67, 0x00 } and not, as expected, { af 04 01 01 00 02 18 05 }.
Connect is sucessful, and SCardGetAttrib allows me to fetch the ATR. The Communicate method works with SCardTransmit. I can post the code if it helps.
Thanks for any pointer!
EDIT:
Thanks for the first answer! I changed the program as suggested:
        byte[] outb = new byte[9];
        int rc5 = Communicate(new byte[]{0x90, 0x60, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00}, ref outb);

Now outb is {  0x91, 0x7E }. This seems to be better, 0x91 looking like an ISO 7816 response code, but unfortunately not 0x90, as expected. (I also had a look at the DESFIRE_TRANSCEIVE macro in the second link that continues reading if it receives 0xf2.) I tried a Google search for ISO 7816 APDU response codes, but had no success in decoding the error code.
EDIT 2:
I also found the following comment:

with an omnikey 5321 I get DESFire ATR 3B8180018080 UID 04 52 2E AA 47
  23 80 90 00 [from apdu FFCA000000] All other apdu give 917E unknown
  error

This explains my error code and gives me another hint, FFCA000000 looking quite similar to my other Mifare 1k string. So with FFCA000000 I get a 9 byte response that seem to contain the UID. Interestingly, the FFCA000000 code also works with the 1k cards, so maybe my solution is just to change the last 04 to 00 and deal with responses of different length. Right?
EDIT 3:
It seems the penny has dropped... 0x04 = 4 bytes response = too small for a 7 byte UID = response 917E = buffer too small :-)

outb always contains { 0x67, 0x00 } and not, as expected, { af 04 01 01 00 02 18 05 }.
Connect is sucessful, and SCardGetAttrib allows me to fetch the ATR. The Communicate method works with SCardTransmit. I can post the code if it helps.

EDIT:
Thanks for the first answer! I changed the program as suggested:
        byte[] outb = new byte[9];
        int rc5 = Communicate(new byte[]{0x90, 0x60, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00}, ref outb);

Now outb is {  0x91, 0x7E }. This seems to be better, 0x91 looking like an ISO 7816 response code, but unfortunately not 0x90, as expected. (I also had a look at the DESFIRE_TRANSCEIVE macro in the second link that continues reading if it receives 0xf2.) I tried a Google search for ISO 7816 APDU response codes, but had no success in decoding the error code.

This explains my error code and gives me another hint, FFCA000000 looking quite similar to my other Mifare 1k string. So with FFCA000000 I get a 9 byte response that seem to contain the UID. Interestingly, the FFCA000000 code also works with the 1k cards, so maybe my solution is just to change the last 04 to 00 and deal with responses of different length. Right?
EDIT 3:
It seems the penny has dropped... 0x04 = 4 bytes response = too small for a 7 byte UID = response 917E = buffer too small :-)

","Read C FAQ 20.10. Hexadecimal is a representation. All numbers are stored in binary internally. Your DES_cblock is probably a typedef for an (unsigned, perhaps!) integral type. So, what you have in effect is an array of integers. You can put numbers in decimal, hexadecimal or binary -- but they will all work. Hexadecimal is typically used in cryptography because it has some notational advantages.

","The clue is in the name of the function you're using:  TripleDesEncryptOneBlock
This method only encrypts one block of the input string (8 bytes or 64 bits).  To encrypt the entire string you need to chain multiple calls to this method.

"6990286","Triple DES encryption","Please note that the issue I am having here is with the key size. At first, based on the comments included in the below code, I figured that my key needed to be 24 bytes (192 bits). This didn't work so I gave 16, 32, and 8 byte keys a shot - nothing seems to be working. By ""not working"" I mean that after my text has been encrypted and decrypted it does not hold the same value as my original text.

Example: 

Original Text: 'Example test this should work '
Encrypted Text: ¸¹pÕô6
Decrypted Text: 'Example '
Here are the two functions I am using (Encrypt / Decrypt functions). Also I will include how I am calling each function.

        {
            // Create a new 3DES key.
            TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider des = new TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider();

            // Set the KeySize = 192 for 168-bit DES encryption.
            // The msb of each byte is a parity bit, so the key length is actually 168 bits.

            des.KeySize = 192;
            des.Key = key;
            des.Mode = CipherMode.ECB;
            des.Padding = PaddingMode.None;

            ICryptoTransform ic = des.CreateEncryptor();

            byte[] enc = ic.TransformFinalBlock(plainText, 0, 8);

            return enc;
        }

        public byte[] TripleDesDecryptBlock(byte[] plainText, byte[] key)
        {
            // Create a new 3DES key.
            TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider des = new TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider();

            // Set the KeySize = 192 for 168-bit DES encryption.
            // The msb of each byte is a parity bit, so the key length is actually 168 bits.
            des.KeySize = 192;

","Use this:
byte[] enc = ic.TransformFinalBlock(plainText, 0, plainText.Length);
I hope it will encrypt/decrypt your whole string. Also you will need not to call this method multiple times

I managed to encrypt and decrypt (getting all kinds of weird symbols) but I never managed to decrypt my encrypted file. That's why I'm looking for a good example but can't seem to find one.
Do you know a good example project that does DES without using any built in libraries from the .NET framework? Or maybe you want to take a look at mine to see if you can spot what I'm doing wrong?

","It's not clear if this is your case, but note it's not possible to access the audio/video from (i.e.:unencrypt) the SRTP merely being a passive observer - that's the whole point of having transport encryption.
The protocol (DTLS-SRTP) works roughly like this:

each browser has a unique keypair, usually generated on installation time
The fingerprint of the public part of the keypair of each side in included in the SDP, in the offer and answer.
Both ends negotiate a DTLS connection, through a ordinary DTLS handshake, thus deriving a kind of session key, which is used to secure the (DTLS) connection
The derived session key is used as the SRTP key

If you don't have access to at least one of the private parts of the keypairs, it's not possible at all to decrypt the connection. If the endpoints choose to use a Diffie-Hellman key exchange on the handshake, a passive attacker will not be able to get the derived key, even with access to both private keys. This property is called forward secrecy.
The only reliable way of accessing the SRTP contents is doing the handshake yourself, implementing a active MITM (changing the fingerprints on the SDP) or getting the private key from the browser and restricting DH key-exchange (which, AFAIK, is not possible at all)

","Padding exception occur when the last cipher text block does not compute to valid plain text. This would happen if last ciphertext block is corrupted or the key is incorrect. For CBC mode it would also happen if the second to last ciphertext was altered (but you are using ECB mode encryption).
In your case, the deriveKeyDES() is always generating a random key. Although we didn't get the actual calls to the security methods, I would presume you use a different key for encryption and decryption. In that case there is a very high chance that the resulting plain text does not contain valid padding bytes.
Rasmus answer certainly points to an error in your code, and it would screw up your timings and return a the plain text two times, but it would not remove the BadPaddingException.

","I had the same problem in one source code, and IllegalBlockSizeException in another one.
Solved this two problems by return encoding data like:
 public String encrypt(String input) {
    try {
        byte[] inputBytes = input.getBytes(""UTF-8"");
        byte[] enc = encryptCipher.doFinal(inputBytes);
        // and problem was in return encoding. That's how i fixed it 
        return Base64.encodeToString(enc,Base64.DEFAULT);
        .....
          }
        }

Give u a code for decrypt:
 public String decrypt(String input) {
    try {
        byte[] dec = Base64.decode(input.getBytes(), Base64.DEFAULT);
        //here had exception
        byte[] utf8 = decryptCipher.doFinal(dec);
        return new String(utf8,""UTF8"");
    } catch (IOException | BadPaddingException | IllegalBlockSizeException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return null;
}

I should submit, that had BadPaddingException and IllegalBlockSizeException 
only in decrypt method byte[] utf8 = decryptCipher.doFinal(dec); (u had exeption in the same place: byte[] plaintext = cipher.doFinal(cipherBytes);), but real wrong is in encrypt method(return value) 
That's why i recommend u to use that code in encrypt method:
return Base64.encodeToString(enc,Base64.DEFAULT);

","You can convert your program into a function:
#include <stdint.h>
#define BIT(x)  ((1 << x))
int sbox(int x) {
    static const uint32_t s[4][16] = {
      14,  0,  4, 15, 13,  7,  1,  4,  2, 14, 15,  2, 11, 13,  8,  1,
       3, 10, 10,  6,  6, 12, 12, 11,  5,  9,  9,  5,  0,  3,  7,  8,
       4, 15,  1, 12, 14,  8,  8,  2, 13,  4,  6,  9,  2,  1, 11,  7,
      15,  5, 12, 11,  9,  3,  7, 14,  3, 10, 10,  0,  5,  6,  0, 13
    };
    return (s[ (( x & BIT(5))?2:0) | ( x & BIT(0) ) ]   // c
            [(x >> 1) & 0xf]);                          // q
}

But there's a flaw in the program, in that the indexing mechanism doesn't match the table organization.
I can take the original sbox1 code:
#include <stdint.h>
static const uint32_t sbox1[64] = {
    14, 4,13, 1, 2,15,11, 8, 3,10, 6,12, 5, 9, 0, 7,
     0,15, 7, 4,14, 2,13, 1,10, 6,12,11, 9, 5, 3, 8,
     4, 1,14, 8,13, 6, 2,11,15,12, 9, 7, 3,10, 5, 0,
    15,12, 8, 2, 4, 9, 1, 7, 5,11, 3,14,10, 0, 6,13   
};
#define BIT(x)  (1 << x)
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i;
    printf(""    static const uint32_t s[64] = {\n"");
    for (i = 0; i < 64; i++) {
        if ((i & 15 ) == 0) 
            printf(""       "");
        printf (""%3d%c"",
            sbox1[(( i & BIT(5))?32:0) | ( i & BIT(0)?16:0 ) |
              ((i >> 1) & 0xf)], 
              (i < 63)?',':' ');
        if ((i & 15) == 15)
            printf(""\n"");
    }
    printf(""    };\n"");
    return (0);
}

And produce your table:
cc     sbox1.c   -o sbox1
sbox1  
static const uint32_t s[64] = {  
    14,  0,  4, 15, 13,  7,  1,  4,  2, 14, 15,  2, 11, 13,  8,  1,  
     3, 10, 10,  6,  6, 12, 12, 11,  5,  9,  9,  5,  0,  3,  7,  8,  
     4, 15,  1, 12, 14,  8,  8,  2, 13,  4,  6,  9,  2,  1, 11,  7,  
    15,  5, 12, 11,  9,  3,  7, 14,  3, 10, 10,  0,  5,  6,  0, 13  
};  

The give away here is that your table rows have duplicate values on them, something that doesn't occur in the DES standard.
So the little program sbox1 also demonstrates that the your sbox has been linearly indexed, meaning all I'd need to do in a program is s[x] to return the correct output, already indexed linearly.
And that says, assuming you make unique tables for the eight boxes, that it's not worth writing a function to call just for a straight table look up.

"7862671","Decrypting DES with OpenSSL","I'm trying to decrypt a DES-encrypted file from an external source with a known key and IV using OpenSSL (other libraries aren't really an option, as the application links against it already and I don't want to introduce new dependencies). It's a Qt application, so the data's coming in and out as QByteArrays.
Here's the code I have at the moment (set to write the decrypted data out to a file for inspection):
AmzHandler::AmzHandler(QByteArray encoded)
{
    QByteArray encrypted = QByteArray::fromBase64(encoded);
    QByteArray decrypted = decrypt(encrypted);
    QFile fred (""decrypted"");
    fred.open(QFile::WriteOnly);
    fred.write(decrypted);
    fred.close();
}

QByteArray AmzHandler::decrypt(QByteArray encrypted)
{
    DES_cblock key = {0x29, 0xab, 0x9d, 0x18, 0xb2, 0x44, 0x9e, 0x31};
    DES_cblock iv = {0x5e, 0x72, 0xd7, 0x9a, 0x11, 0xb3, 0x4f, 0xee};
    DES_key_schedule schedule;
    unsigned char decrypted[encrypted.size()];

    DES_set_odd_parity(&key);
    DES_set_key_checked(&key, &schedule);

    DES_ncbc_encrypt((unsigned char * )encrypted.constData(), (unsigned char * )decrypted, encrypted.size(), &schedule, &iv, DES_DECRYPT);

    return QByteArray::fromRawData((char * )decrypted, length);
}

The output file for my test input is nonsense, and is not consistent across multiple runs. (I have a working implementation in Python, which is attached at the bottom of this post, to test against.) I'm not really sure what's going on; whether I've made some simple screwup in the conversions to char or am misusing OpenSSL.
EDIT: Solved. It turns out the line DES_set_odd_parity(&key); was missing. Add that and it works.
Here's working code in Python:
def AmzHandler(encoded):
    encrypted = base64.b64decode(encoded)
    d = pyDes.des(hex_to_str(""29AB9D18B2449E31""), mode=pyDes.CBC, IV=hex_to_str(""5E72D79A11B34FEE""))
    decrypted = d.decrypt(encrypted)
    f = open(""decrypted-py"", ""w"")
    f.write(decrypted)
    f.close()

","The issue was just a missing call to DES_set_odd_parity(&key);, which appears to be necessary for correct decoding with this implementation. Working code is as follows:
QByteArray AmzHandler::decrypt(QByteArray encrypted)
{
    DES_cblock key = {0x29, 0xab, 0x9d, 0x18, 0xb2, 0x44, 0x9e, 0x31};

"9979358","PyCrypto: Generate RSA key protected with DES3 password","I have been able to create a RSA key protected by password with DES3 (well... I think because I'm very new to this encryption world) by using the command:
openssl genrsa -out ""/tmp/myKey.pem"" -passout pass:""f00bar"" -des3 2048

Now, I would like to do that inside a Python script, using PyCrypto, if possible. I have seen this message, which seems to discourage the use of PyCrypto to do that. Is it still like that?
Of course I can always call os.execute, and execute the above command, but I'd consider that ""cheating"" :-). I'm pretty much doing this to learn PyCrypto.
Thank you in advance.
","Starting from PyCrypto 2.5 you can export an RSA private key and have it protected under a passphrase. A Triple DES key is internally derived from the passphrase and used to perform the actual encryption.
For instance:
from Crypto import RSA
from Crypto import Random

random_generator = Random.new().read
key = RSA.generate(1024, random_generator)
exportedKey = key.exportKey('PEM', 'my secret', pkcs=1)

The variable exportedKey contains an ASCII version (PEM) of the key, encoded according to PKCS#1 (a cryptographic standard. Another option is pkcs=8 for - guess what - PKCS#8). Since the result is standard, you can use it with several other programs, including openssl.
And of course, you can also re-import it back into python via PyCrypto!
The exportKey method is documented here.

Correct me If i'm wrong but if I convert a certain password for example ""test"" using DES hashing because of the salt there are many possibilities. How does the system (I image it just compares the generated hashes) than know that the entered password is correct?
","The salt is stored in plaintext, so to speak. It is there to prevent some kinds of attacks, but the salt is only some piece of public (although site-local) information that is catenated to the password before hashing.
So let us say that your password is “test” and you work at Cyberdyne. The administrator may have decided that the salt would be “Cyber”, so that the string that gets hashed though DES is “Cybertest”.
When you input the password “test”, it is added to the local salt again before applying DES, so that the result of salting+hashing matches the stored password.
If a smart guy (or gal) has built a rainbow table of the DES signatures of all dictionary words, he (or she) will not find your hashed password in it, because the crypted version is not DES(test), it is DES(cybertest).

","This has been pretty well answered, but just thought I'd add some additional info with a practical example.
On most modern systems, the passwords are actually stored in a shadow file /etc/shadow (which is only readable by root), not in /etc/passwd.  As a simple exercise to see how it all actually works, try the following:  As root, view the line from the shadow file for your user record: 
cat /etc/shadow | grep yourusername

You will see something like this:
yourusername:$1$TrOIigLp$PUHL00kS5UY3CMVaiC0/g0:15020:0:99999:7:::

After your username there is $1.  This indicates that it is an MD5 hash.  After that there is another $, then (in this case) TrOIigLp followed by another $.  TrOIigLp is the salt.  After that is the hashed password, which was hashed using the salt - in this case PUHL00kS5UY3CMVaiC0/g0.
Now, you can use openssl to hash your password using the same salt, like so:
 openssl passwd -1 -salt TrOIigLp

Enter your user password when prompted, the openssl command should compute the MD5 hash using the salt provided, and it should be exactly the same as the above from the shadow file.  The -1 in the above command is for MD5 hashing.

","It seems that you need a cyclic left shift. BigInteger.shiftLeft is not cyclic. You'd have to combine shiftLeft, shiftRight, and and or, just like you would if you were using int and <<.
static BigInteger allOnes(int L) {
    return BigInteger.ZERO
        .setBit(L)
        .subtract(BigInteger.ONE);
}

static BigInteger cyclicLeftShift(BigInteger n, int L, int k) {
    return n.shiftLeft(k)
        .or(n.shiftRight(L - k))
        .and(allOnes(L));
}

Now, cyclicLeftShift(n, L, k) returns n cyclically-shifted k bits to the left, where the cycle window is L.
How this works is as follows:
                               _________L__________
                              /                    \

                              \__k__/\_____L-k_____/



n.shiftLeft(k) :       [ABCDE][FG...........][00000]
   .or
n.shiftRight(L - k) :                        [ABCDE]

   =                   [ABCDE][FG...........][ABCDE]

                               _________L__________
   .and                       /                    \
allOnes(L) :                  [111..............111]

   =                          [FG...........][ABCDE]

Note: if you have a fixed L, you can optimize this a bit by caching allOnes(L) instead of computing it every time.

","BigInteger implements infinite-precision integers, so shifting to the left will keep adding zeros to the left.  You need a rotate:
private static BigInteger rotateLeft(BigInteger bi) {
    BigInteger ret = bi.shiftLeft(1);
    if (ret.testBit(32)) {
        ret = ret.clearBit(32).setBit(0);
    }
    return ret;
}

That's going to be rather inefficient for 32-bit numbers, so you might as well just use primitives to rotate DES' 28-bit halves.  I'm not familiar with the DES algorithm, so I'll assume you need BigInteger for something else.
private static BigInteger rotateLeftPrimitive(BigInteger bi) {
    int value = bi.intValue();
    return BigInteger.valueOf(((value << 1) & 0xffffffe) | ((value >>> 27) & 1));

","Addressing the bigger question 1) DES is broken and should never be used for anything other than working with legacy systems, 2) the Sun JCE already provides an implementation (as does BouncyCastle and other crypto providers), and 3) implementing any crypto algorithm is challenging and you really want to go with a well-tested implementation for production use.
If it's a class exercise I would use a byte[] instead of a BigInteger.  You'll need to do a little bit more by hand but it's a lot closer to the spirit of DES since it was designed to be easily implemented in hardware.

"2727005","BitShifting with BigIntegers in Java","I am implementing DES Encryption in Java with use of BigIntegers.
I am left shifting binary keys with Java BigIntegers by doing the BigInteger.leftShift(int n) method. Key of N (Kn) is dependent on the result of the shift of Kn-1.  The problem I am getting is that I am printing out the results after each key is generated and the shifting is not the expected out put.  The key is split in 2 Cn and Dn (left and right respectively).
I am specifically attempting this:
""To do a left shift, move each bit one place to the left, except for the first bit, which is cycled to the end of the block. ""
It seems to tack on O's on the end depending on the shift. Not sure how to go about correcting this.

","I think your idea of implementing DES using bit strings is reasonable as an educational tool. Instead of directly using BigIntegers to represent these bitstrings, I recommend you create a BitString class that implements exactly those bit string methods you need for your project. Inside the BitString class, you can use BigIntegers, but you may find that a simple int array with 1 bit per array element is just as easy or easier, or maybe a linked list.

"6107288","DES decryption error ""Bad Data"" in C# when closing cryptostream","I try to decrypt an  encrypted byte array (encrypt with K1 and decrypt with K2). Visual Studio throws an exception ""BAD DATA"" when it tries to close my crypto stream
here's my code snippet of DES decryption
public Byte[] Decrypt(Byte[] cipherData, Byte[] key, Byte[] iv)
    {
        MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
        DES mDES = DES.Create();
        mDES.Key = key;

        cs.Close();
        Byte[] decryptedData = ms.ToArray();
        return decryptedData;
    }

the initial vector is the same as encryption. I don't know why this error occurred. 
Added:
As recommended by Greg B, I post here my code snippet of encryption. The output of encryption is the input of decryption (two different keys)
        public Byte[] Decrypt(Byte[] cipherData, Byte[] key, Byte[] iv)
    {
        MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
        DES mDES = DES.Create();

        cs.Write(cipherData, 0, cipherData.Length);
        cs.Close();
        Byte[] decryptedData = ms.ToArray();
        return decryptedData;
    }

","the problem you encountered comes from the selected padding mode.
since padding is used when decrypting your cipher text the cryptostream tries to remove the padding when your retrieve the decrypted bytes. since you don't use the key the data was encrypted with, you will get ""garbage"" ... the cryptostream fails to detect the padding that needs to be removed, and the operation fails with the observed exception.
if you want to rebuld someething like 3DES with the DES class use PaddingMode NONE for your decryption and the following encryption step (so only the first encryption or the last decryption uses padding)

","I believe the link you are following is suggesting a new way to encrypt and decrypt mimicking that of how the SQL EncryptByPassPhrase is made. So, you could only use the decrypt in C#, if you encrypted in C# as well.
Since, you already used EncryptByPassPhrase in SQL then I would suggest just using DecryptByPassPhrase in SQL before passing to C# code.
Example of your hello world encrypt and decrypt:
Declare @lEncryptedText VARBINARY(256) = (select ENCRYPTBYPASSPHRASE('hello','world'))
SELECT @lEncryptedText --Encrypted VALUE for world

SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR(100),DECRYPTBYPASSPHRASE('hello',@lEncryptedText)) --Decrypted Value

I need to migrate this code to Nodejs and facing multiple issues. I refeered http://mygo.iteye.com/blog/2018882 to get the basic idea on nodejs way to do the encryption in des3. However I see following difference in JAVA way and Nodejs way.
1. JAVA is using Hex string of 48 lenght as key, since one char in hex is 4 bits therfore final size is equivalent to 24 bytes length which meets DES3 requirement. 
2. In Java code, final key is being used as bytes (as needed by DES) which made indpendent of the way we store the key
3. In node js, key is stored as character i.e. to use des3 I have to use 24 bytes which is equivalent to 24 chars key as  73AD9CEC99816AA6A4D82FB2. Here this is string of 24 chars and since one char is one byte thereofore total length is 24 bytes which meets DES3 requirement.

","Running crypto.getCiphers() shows you the available ciphers. Triple DES (EDE) in ECB mode with two keys (16 byte key) can be used as des-ede. If you have three part key (24 byte key) you should use des-ede3. ecb probably does not appear in the cipher description, because it's the most basic form.
Triple DES-EDE has different ways to use a key. EDE means encrypt-decrypt-encrypt with three different keys. If you only have for example one 8 byte key, this suggests that you use the same key for every phase of EDE. It's clear from your Java code that you have a 24 byte key (48 hex encoded chars). You have to use the same key.
The crypto module uses PKCS7 padding by default, so you will need to set the auto padding to false and do the padding yourself. I leave that task up to you.

Word of caution:
Don't use (3)DES especially with only one 8 byte key! Don't use ECB mode! Don't use NoPadding for block modes! Use AES-256 with GCM mode (no padding since it's a streaming mode).-

I did understand the algorithm, but am stuck at the very beginning as to manipulation of the key.
Here's the problem.
In DES, we have a 64-bit key (8 chars in C and 4 in Java, although I can cast the char to byte to get only the ASCII part), of which every 8th bit is a parity bit and needs to be stripped to make it a 56-bit key and do further processing. I have thought about this for long, but cannot find a way to strip every 8th bit and store the result in another char array (in Java as well as C).
I tried using the java.util.BitSet class, but got confused.
Any suggestions as to how can I remove every 8th bit and concat adjacent bytes(Java) or chars(C) to get the 56 bit key?
I am aware of the bit operations and shifting, but for the specific example:
Suppose I have an 16 bit key: 1100 1001 1101 1000.
I need to remove the 8th and 16th bit, making the key: 1100 100 1101 100.
If I declare 2 bytes, how do I truncate the 8th bit and append the 9th bit to it, making the first byte: 1100 1001
So, what I need help with is how do I, replace 8th bit with 9th bit, replace 16th bit with 17th bit and so on to derive a 56-bit key from 64-bit key?
If someone can explain it to me, I might probably be able to implement it regardless of language.
","In C, you can manipulate bits with the bitwise operators, such as & and |, as well as the bitshift operators << and >>.
For instance, to turn off the high bit of a given byte, you can do this.
char c = 0xBF;  // initial value is bit pattern 10111111
c &= 0x7F;      // perform AND against the bit pattern 01111111
                // final value is bit pattern 00111111 (0x3F)

Does that make sense?
Obviously, you need to be able to convert from a bit pattern to hex, but that's not too hard.
You can use similar masking to extract the bits you want, and put them in an output buffer.
Update:
You have 64 bits (8 bytes) of input, and want 56 bits (7 bytes) of output.
Let's represent your input as the following, where each letter represents a single bit
The 'x' bits are the ones you want to throw away.
xAAAAAAA xBBBBBBB xCCCCCCC xDDDDDDD xEEEEEEE xFFFFFFF xGGGGGGG xHHHHHHH

So you want your final answer to be:
AAAAAAAB BBBBBBCC CCCCCDDD DDDDEEEE EEEFFFFF FFGGGGGG GHHHHHHH

So in C, we might have code like this:
unsigned char data[8] = {/* put data here */};

// chop off the top bit of the first byte
data[0] <<= 1;

// the bottom bit of data[0] needs to come from the top data bit of data[1]
data[0] |= (data[1] >> 6) & 0x01;

// use similar transformations to fill in data[1], data[2], ... data[6]
// At the end, data[7] will be useless

Of course this is not optimized at all, but hopefully you get the idea.

","Be careful of 16-bit chars in Java.  Many methods only convert the lower 8 bits.  Read the documentation carefully.  It is more usual to treat a cryptographic key as a a byte[] in Java due to the stronger typing than in C.
As to the parity bits, check through the DES algorithm carefully and see where they are used.  That should give you a hint as to what you need to do with them.

","I can briefly tell about a way....i will explain further if required...
Right shift all the 8 chars by 1 ie c1 = c1>>1 etc
Multiplyc1 with the total number of bytes (ie56) ie c1 * 0x0000000000 (not sure how  many zeros)
Then, add 0x0000+ to next chars ie c2 = c2 + 0x0000; c3 = c3 + 0x000000 so on (Keep adding 2 0s for proceeding chars)  
Now, start adding c1 + c2 + c3.......
The idea here is that, first fill in the number with zeros and start adding teh other chars so that they keep lying properly
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
34 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   (c1 = c1>>1) . Here c1=0x34, c2=0x67
00 67 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   (c2 = c2>>1)
so on...............

Add teh above;
I hope this will help.

","@jwd, @jscode
Thanks a lot for your help.
To jwd: I got the idea from your code. Seemed pretty simple logic after I read it..  :-) Wonder why I didnt think of that.
Well, I did polish your idea a little bit and it works fine now in Java.
If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.
THANKS..
P.S.: The testing part is very primitive. I print the bit values. I did it manually for a couple of examples and used the same as input and it works fine.

"22070990","How to decrypt 3DES in ECB mode (using a wordlist)?","I have some encrypted texts (encrypted with 3DES in ECB mode without salt). 
My question: How can I decrypt them using a wordlist? (or without one?)
Example: 
Encrypted text:  
Xfi+h4Ir6l7zXCP+N4EPvQ==

The wordlist for this: 
foo
bar
marketing

The original text was before encrypting was: ""marketing"" (just to make the example full). 
I tried with the commented python script: 
$ cat 3des.py 
 #!/usr/local/bin/python

from pyDes import *

data = ""marketing""
k = des(""DESCRYPT"", CBC, ""\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"", pad=None, padmode=PAD_PKCS5)
d = k.encrypt(data)
print ""Encrypted: %r"" % d
print ""Decrypted: %r"" % k.decrypt(d)
assert k.decrypt(d, padmode=PAD_PKCS5) == data

testing it: 
$ python 3des.py 
Encrypted: '\xabd\xfc\x98x\x86\x8d\xb5A\xba\x8e\x12,\x1f\x83\xb5'
Decrypted: 'marketing'
$ 

A little help please?
","If you're going to use pyDES, you'll first have to configure your the script to use 3DES...  Here's the provided pyDES example, modified to use 3DES:
from pyDes import *

data = ""marketing""
k = triple_des(""DESCRYPTDESCRYPT"", ECB, ""\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"", pad=None, padmode=PAD_PKCS5)
d = k.encrypt(data)
print ""Encrypted: %r"" % d
print ""Decrypted: %r"" % k.decrypt(d)
assert k.decrypt(d, padmode=PAD_PKCS5) == data

To break it down...
The following line contains the class initialization information:
k = triple_des(""DESCRYPTDESCRYPT"", ECB, ""\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"", pad=None, padmode=PAD_PKCS5)

From the documentation, the params are as follows:
(key, [mode], [IV], [pad], [padmode])

key     -> Bytes containing the encryption key. 8 bytes for DES, 16 or 24 bytes
       for Triple DES
mode    -> Optional argument for encryption type, can be either
       pyDes.ECB (Electronic Code Book) or pyDes.CBC (Cypher Block Chaining)
IV      -> Optional Initial Value bytes, must be supplied if using CBC mode.
       Length must be 8 bytes.
pad     -> Optional argument, set the pad character (PAD_NORMAL) to use during
       all encrypt/decrpt operations done with this instance.
padmode -> Optional argument, set the padding mode (PAD_NORMAL or PAD_PKCS5)
       to use during all encrypt/decrpt operations done with this instance.

So, in my modified example, I've configured the params like this...
Key: DESCRYPTDESCRYPT
Mode: ECB
IV: ""\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0""
pad: None
padmode: PAD_PKCS5

So, from here, you'll need to change the 'data' variable above to the ciphertext you want to decrypt and then load your wordlist into an array, set up a loop to iterate the values in the array through the 'key' param...

Here's the diagram of CBC Send and CBC Receive algorithms as per DESFire EV1 manufacturer instructions:


","During an ISO or AES authentication the following scheme is used:

Random B is received from the card with RECEIVE + DECIPHER
Random AB is sent to the card with SEND + ENCIPHER
Random A is received with RECEIVE + DECIPHER

IMPORTANT: ALL encryption goes through CBC. The IV of the key used for CBC encryption/decryption is only reset ONCE at the beginning. Then it must be maintained up to date during ALL the following commands.
If you use ISO or AES mode, after a successfull authentication, you MUST also calulcate the CMAC over sent commands and received data, otherwise your IV will not be in sync with the card and you get an Integrity Error each time you use the Session key!
As I was struggeling with the same problems I posted some communication examples that will help you much in testing your code. You find them here on Stackoverflow: Desfire EV1 communication examples There you also find a link to my source code that I recommnd you to study.

I've used the SmartCardShell program to run a javascript code that extracts the data off a British e-Passport.
I'm trying to replicate the code in java for my dissertation. However I am stumped on the MAC generation. 
The javascript code for the data encryption and MAC generation is:
var cryptogram = crypto.encrypt(kenc, Crypto.DES_CBC, plain, new ByteString(""0000000000000000"", HEX));
print(""Cryptogram   : "" + cryptogram);'

var mac = crypto.sign(kmac, Crypto.DES_MAC_EMV, cryptogram.pad(Crypto.ISO9797_METHOD_2));
print(""MAC          : "" + mac);

I've managed to correctly verify that my encryption key (Kenc) is generated correctly.
Going off the script code, the MAC key (Kmac) is also a triple DES key which is done via:
byte[] kmackey = new byte[24];
System.arraycopy(kmac, 0, kmackey, 0, kmac.length);
System.arraycopy(kmac, 0, kmackey, kmac.length, 8);
System.out.println(""kmackey = "" + ConvertToHex.convertToHex(kmackey));

DESedeKeySpec desedekey = new DESedeKeySpec(kmackey);
SecretKeyFactory keyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""DESede"");
Key KMac = keyFactory.generateSecret(desedekey);

As seen above, the javascript code ""signs"" the data with the Kmac key, the DES_MAC_EMV mechanism and pads the cryptogram data with the ISO 9797 padding method 2 - which I believe is called ""bit padding"".
Can anyone assist me in creating/explaining to me a Java equivalent of the DES_MAC_EMV mechanism and the ISO 9797 padding method 2?
Appreciate the help
Just to add as I forgot to mention it, I am creating a system to connect to the e-Passport and extract data. At the minute I am verifying the data I obtained from the SmartCardShell program/javascript code. This is not a javacard applet/application, it is solely a Java ""host"" application
HSK
","Padding
Padding is actually very simple. Some places refer to the padding method 2 of ISO 9797-1 as Bit Padding. You basically add a single 0x80 byte at the end and then append sufficient number of 0x00 so that the total length of the message is a multiple of 8.
Encryption
DES_MAC_EMV in the above code is more formally named ISO 9797-1 Algorithm 3. Some articles/ websites also refer to it as Retail MAC algorithm.
You need two 8 byte keys for this algorithm and perform 3DES as defined below. Please note that this is my understanding of the algorithm (off-my-head); please read the formal specs for a ""correct"" understanding:

First do the required padding
Use an initialisation vector of 0 (all zeroes)
Chain and encrypt 8 bit blocks using the first key (as in
single DES)
The final block needs a 3DES application; hence decrypt using the second key and encrypt it with the first key again

Ciphertext is 16 bytes.
Decrypted: >>(null)<<
Decrypted: >>12345678<<
Decrypted: >>9abcdef<<

Here it says that the the chipertext is 16 bytes (which is ok). But the key itself(hex code printed above) is 64 bytes long! 
However, DES3 with two-key options should have key length with 128 bits (including parity bits). However the EVP_MAX_KEY_LENGTH definition is by default 64. Also I've tried to print  the chiper key length, the size of variable key and the ctx key size as seen below:
printf(""Key length DES3: %d\n"", EVP_CIPHER_key_length(EVP_des_ede3_cbc()));
printf(""Key size: %d\n"", sizeof(key));
printf(""Cipher CTX key length: %d\n\n"", EVP_CIPHER_CTX_key_length(&ctx));

This will output:
Key length DES3: 24
Key size: 64
Cipher CTX key length: 16

I'm a little bit confused here. Shouldn't be the DES3(two-key) key size 128 bits? Why is the length of DES3 key printed as 24(is this bit,byte,etc..)? Why are all these key lengths and sizes different?
","
However, DES3 with two-key options should have key length with 128 bits (including parity bits)

Yes. 2-key 3DES has a key size of 64x2 = 128-bits; and 3-key 3DES has a key size of 64x3 = 192-bits (as Greg S stated).

However the EVP_MAX_KEY_LENGTH definition is by default 64

That's the maximum it can be (for all EVP symmetric ciphers), and not just DES/3DES/AES, etc. That value might even change in the future.

Shouldn't be the DES3 (two-key) key size 128 bits?

Yes.

Why is the length of DES3 key printed as 24 (is this bit, byte, etc..)?

Who knows.... but its in bytes, not bits.

Why are all these key lengths and sizes different?

The size is based on the algorithm or cryptosystem.
2-key 3DES performs Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt and uses two keys. So one of the keys is used twice. 3-key 3DES performs Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt and uses three independent keys. That's how they were designed.

After the permutation the result is divided in half and the sides swapped. This will enable it to be put back using the same algorithm but with the IPinverse table.

Your permutation contains indexes from 1 to 64, but the way you use them, they should be 0 to 63.
What's the swap for? If you permute, swap, then permute back, you won't reach the same place.
You need to verify that the permutation and reverse are indeed opposites. I'm surely not going to go over all the numbers and verify it.

","Looks like you are using the GNU JRE and it doesn't have a JCE in it. You can solve this by downloading the bouncy castle JCE and add it as a provider;
Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());

Note also that your encryptionBitCount looks suspicious as DES has a fixed key sice of 56 bits.
DES and MD5 are considered obsolete, you might want to try AES for the cipher and SHA for the hashing instead. The bouncy castle API provides an algorithm PBEWITHSHAAND128BITAES-CBC-BC which might do the trick.

","See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation for a description of the different modes of operation used in block ciphers. You don't need an initialization vector (IV) if you're using ECB mode which is just encrypting the message block by block. Maybe you have to check your DES library for setting ECB mode / disabling others.
If they aren't using ECB mode you need the IV, you can't ""guess"" it. The IV in most cases doesn't has to be secret, so it's not a problem to move it around.

(Some pieces of libdes code reused, though I had to figure out the DES ""checksum"" part myself).
The last pitfall is, that libdes uses non-standard padding mechanism. It's almost like the ISO one, but the last byte is not the number of added bytes but 8 - this number. I set the Padding property to None and handled the padding myself.

Make note of the usage of using blocks and also how the padding is applied to the different streams.
The framework TripleDES is about 2.5 times faster than the above code.
public static byte[] TripleDESEncryptFramework(byte[] plainText, byte[] key)
{
  var tdes = TripleDES.Create();
  tdes.Mode = CipherMode.ECB;
  tdes.Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7;
  tdes.Key = key;

  var encryptor = tdes.CreateEncryptor();

  byte[] result;
  using (var ms = new MemoryStream())
  {
    using (var cs = new CryptoStream(ms, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write))
      cs.Write(plainText, 0, plainText.Length);

    result = ms.ToArray();
  }

  return result;
}

If you want to compare the results of the two different encryption methods then you need to remember that the 24-bit key for TripleDES is actually the 3 keys put in one array:
[  key1  ][  key2  ][  key3  ]
==============================
[            key             ]

","So you just want to know how to read and write to a file?
Take a look at apache.commons.io.FileUtils. It offers both methods for reading and writing strings from/to a file. Here are some examples:
// info.txt represents the path to the file
File someFile = new File(""info.txt"");

// Create String from File
try {
  String filecontent = FileUtils.readFileToString(someFile, Charset.defaultCharset());
  System.out.println(filecontent);

} catch (IOException e) {
  e.printStackTrace();
}

// Encode / Decode string here

// Write String to file     
try {
  FileUtils.writeStringToFile(someFile, ""your new file content string"", Charset.defaultCharset());
  System.out.println(""Success!"");

} catch (IOException e) {
  e.printStackTrace();
}

You might want to use a different Charset, depending on the charset of your text file.

Edit:- 
Followed zacheusz and solved encoding problem, but encoded strings in both .NET and java are different...
","I see that in .NET you are specyfing IV:
cryptoProvider.CreateEncryptor(bytes, bytes)

According to the documentation the second byte array is the IV. So you should use the same array in Java.
I think that the bug is here:
cipher.doFinal(Base64.encodeBase64(inputText.getBytes(""ASCII""))); 

You are b64 encoding input before decrypting it.
Try
    byte[] output = cipher.doFinal(inputText.getBytes(""ASCII""));  
    System.out.println(""Encoded Value ..... ""+new String(Base64.encodeBase64(output)));

Additional remarks (regarding your questions in comments):

you need the same iv for Java and .NET 
the constructor for IvParameterSpec takes byte[] as an argument 
In .NET the CreateEncryptor method takes byte[] IV as second argument:

This writes decrypted data out to a file.

    }

    return ms;

On the line currBytes = cs.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length) I receive the error ""Length of the data to decrypt is invalid"" but only on the second set, not the first.  The ICryptoTransform ""decryptor"" is created from a common method, and I know it's using the same key.
Can anyone tell me why I would not be getting this error in the first instance, but would be in the second, and (more importantly) how to fix it.
And, yes, I know DES is not the best encryption method ever.  This is something in the nature of a proof-of-concept that will never see the light of day in a production environment.
","Try to add these checks to both pieces of code. I strongly suspect one or both of these fails:

    long totalBytes = inStream.Length;

        readBytes += currBytes;

This writes decrypted data out to a file.
Then I have this code which does exactly the same thing, except it writes to (and returns) a MemoryStream:
using(MemoryStream memStream = new MemoryStream(inBytes))
using(MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream())
using (CryptoStream cs = new CryptoStream(memStream, decryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Read))
{
    byte[] buffer;
    if (inBytes.Length < (1024 * 10)) buffer = new byte[inBytes.Length];
    else buffer = new byte[(1024 * 10)];
    long readBytes = 0;
    long totalBytes = inStream.Length;
    int currBytes;

    while (readBytes < totalBytes)
    {
        currBytes = cs.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);
        ms.Write(buffer, 0, currBytes);
        readBytes += currBytes;
    }

    return ms;
}

On the line currBytes = cs.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length) I receive the error ""Length of the data to decrypt is invalid"" but only on the second set, not the first.  The ICryptoTransform ""decryptor"" is created from a common method, and I know it's using the same key.
Can anyone tell me why I would not be getting this error in the first instance, but would be in the second, and (more importantly) how to fix it.
And, yes, I know DES is not the best encryption method ever.  This is something in the nature of a proof-of-concept that will never see the light of day in a production environment.
","I ran into this error today and it turned out that I had converted one source string into a byte array using ASCII in one function and the other using Base64 in a different function.

","The SecureRandom object is optional. If you don't select one, Java will use a default source of randomness. See the documentation of this method to understand how one is selected.
The Cipher Javadocs explains the purpose of this argument:

If this cipher (including its underlying feedback or padding scheme) requires any random bytes (e.g., for parameter generation), it will get them from random. 

So, in your particular case, you are probably not making use of this item at all. Nothing in your DES usage will require random data (since you appear to be using ECB mode). If you were using CBC-mode, then I assume the IV would be randomly generated from the SecureRandom object.

Is this the correct way of encrypting data using DES cryptography?
","I can't help you with the C#, but I can attempt to address your last question: whether this is the ""correct way"" to encrypt. Well, that answer depends on what you're expecting to do.
What you've implemented is a mode known as CBC-MAC; it doesn't allow the receiver to recover the message (and hence it's not really ""encryption"" at all); one clue to this is that the message is 16 bytes, but the ""encrypted"" message is only 8 bytes.  It does have the property that it is difficult for someone in the middle to modify the message and to come up with the correct 8 byte MAC value (assuming they don't have the key); hence, things like this are often used as cryptographically strong integrity checks.  Now, CBC-MAC does have problems with length extension attacks; if you don't care about length extension attacks (all your messages are 16 bytes), this might not be important to you?
Is CBC-MAC the right thing for your application?  Well, I don't know the answer to that; the key questions for you:

What are you trying to do?  Are you trying to ""encrypt"" a message (so that the other side can recover it)?  Or, are you trying to prove that the message was sent by someone with the key?
Are you trying to be compatible with someone else?  Has that someone else specified this ""encryption"" method?
ortag decided to omit the warnings for DES, but I think I'll include them - DES can be broken with not totally unreasonable amounts of work; it's probably safe against your kid sister and maybe even joe average hacker, but if your adversary has access to a some computer resources, he can break this.

"10634065","encryption using provided key using DES with padding","I want to encrypt a frame using DES using a given key. 
The padding style I am using is PKCS5Padding. This pads the string with 02 02 if 2 bytes are to be added and with 03 03 03 if 3 bytes are to be added to make multiple of 8.
But my requirement is to pad a string with my particular bytes. e.g if 2 bytes are to be added then 30 30 and 3 bytes are to be added then 30 30 30 (in hex 0's value is 30). Also, I must know how many padded bytes have been added.
Which padding technique should I follow and how can I use it?
Below is my code for encryption:
byte[] keyValue = new byte[]{(byte) 0x30, (byte) 0x30, (byte) 0x30, (byte) 0x30, (byte) 0x30, (byte) 0x16,(byte) 0x05, (byte) 0x12};
myKeySpec = new DESKeySpec(keyValue);
mySecretKeyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""DES"");
key = mySecretKeyFactory.generateSecret(myKeySpec);


Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""DES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");
IvParameterSpec iv2 = new IvParameterSpec(new byte[8]);
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, iv2);
byte[] plainText = function.HexStringToByteArray(payloadRecv);
byte[] encryptedText = cipher.doFinal(plainText);

","Do not select PKCS5Padding in the cipher specification. Select NoPadding. You'll have to add the padding onto the data yourself prior to encrypting it. After decrypting it (also using no padding), you'll have to inspect the last byte to know how many bytes of padding to remove and remove it yourself.
Basically, just code exactly what you described.

","I have written an article in CodeProject, to Implement a simplified version of the DES block cipher algorithm using C# to encrypt and decrypt binary files.
The SDES.cs class is a generic class which could be used to encrypt/decrypt binary files or plain text.
I will change the two following methods in MainFrm.cs file to suit your needs
private void Encrypt()
private void Decrypt()

The changes as follow, instead of opening the file using the BinaryReader class,

I will loop over the plain text ""string"" and read it char by char
convert each char to byte 
encrypt the byte and append it to byte array
finally convert the encrypted bytes to chars again

the code will be:
private void Encrypt()
{
     byte[] output = new byte[txt_enc_in.Text.Length];
     for (int i = 0; i < output.Length; i++)
     {
          output[i] = my_Des.Encrypt(Convert.ToByte(txt_enc_in.Text[i]));
     }
     txt_enc_out.Text = """";
     for (int i = 0; i < output.Length; i++)
     {
          txt_enc_out.Text += Convert.ToChar(output[i]);
     }
 }  

the inverse steps also applied on the Decrypt() method, also some changes should be applied on the GUI.
the final code is available here.

","Make sure your key consists of the same bytes (strings may be encoded differently) and feed it a IV filled with zero's. ECB mode does not use an IV (and the PHP manual specifies as much), but if you do give it one default it to all zero's - the IV will be XOR'ed with the first plain text block, so setting it to all zero's will cancel out that operation. Also, make sure that the input cipher data is the same. Ignore the padding in the first instance, you should be able to check if the result is correct before unpadding.

"24168246","Replicate Java's PBEWithMD5AndDES in Python 2.7","If it's not immediately obvious, let me start by saying I am not a crypto person.
I have been tasked with replicating the behavior of Java's PBEWithMD5AndDES (MD5 digest with DES encryption) in Python 2.7.
I do have access to Python's cryptography toolkit PyCrypto.
Here is the Java code whose behavior I am trying to replicate:
import java.security.spec.KeySpec;
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEKeySpec;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory;
import java.security.spec.AlgorithmParameterSpec;
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEParameterSpec;
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter;

public class EncryptInJava
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
      String encryptionPassword = ""q1w2e3r4t5y6"";
      byte[] salt = { -128, 64, -32, 16, -8, 4, -2, 1 };
      int iterations = 50;

      try
      {
        KeySpec keySpec = new PBEKeySpec(encryptionPassword.toCharArray(), salt, iterations);
        SecretKey key = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBEWithMD5AndDES"").generateSecret(keySpec);
        AlgorithmParameterSpec paramSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, iterations);

        Cipher encoder = Cipher.getInstance(key.getAlgorithm());
        encoder.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, paramSpec);

        String str_to_encrypt = ""MyP455w0rd"";
        byte[] enc = encoder.doFinal(str_to_encrypt.getBytes(""UTF8""));

        System.out.println(""encrypted = "" + DatatypeConverter.printBase64Binary(enc));
      }
      catch (Exception e)
      {
        e.printStackTrace();
      }
    }
}

For the given values, it outputs the following:
encrypted = Icy6sAP7adLgRoXNYe9N8A==

Here's my ham-handed attempt to port the above to Python, encrypt_in_python.py:
from Crypto.Hash import MD5
from Crypto.Cipher import DES

_password = 'q1w2e3r4t5y6'
_salt = '\x80\x40\xe0\x10\xf8\x04\xfe\x01'
_iterations = 50
plaintext_to_encrypt = 'MyP455w0rd'

if ""__main__"" == __name__:

    """"""Mimic Java's PBEWithMD5AndDES algorithm to produce a DES key""""""
    hasher = MD5.new()
    hasher.update(_password)
    hasher.update(_salt)
    result = hasher.digest()

    for i in range(1, _iterations):
        hasher = MD5.new()
        hasher.update(result)
        result = hasher.digest()

    key = result[:8]

    encoder = DES.new(key)
    encrypted = encoder.encrypt(plaintext_to_encrypt + ' ' * (8 - (len(plaintext_to_encrypt) % 8)))
    print encrypted.encode('base64')

It outputs a completely different string.
Is it possible to port the Java implementation to a Python implementation with standard Python libraries?
Apparently the Python implementation requires that the plaintext that I encrypt be a multiple of eight characters, and I'm not even sure exactly how to pad my plaintext input to meet that condition.
Thanks for your help.
","If you're using the newer Cryptodome library with Python 3, you'll need to also encode your plaintext_to_encrypt to 'latin-1', as is shown below.
from Cryptodome.Hash import MD5
from Cryptodome.Cipher import DES
import base64
import re

_password = b'q1w2e3r4t5y6'
_salt = b'\x80\x40\xe0\x10\xf8\x04\xfe\x01'

_iterations = 50

plaintext_to_encrypt = 'MyP455w0rd'

# Pad plaintext per RFC 2898 Section 6.1
padding = 8 - len(plaintext_to_encrypt) % 8
plaintext_to_encrypt += chr(padding) * padding

if ""__main__"" == __name__:

    """"""Mimic Java's PBEWithMD5AndDES algorithm to produce a DES key""""""
    hasher = MD5.new()
    hasher.update(_password)
    hasher.update(_salt)
    result = hasher.digest()

    for i in range(1, _iterations):
        hasher = MD5.new()
        hasher.update(result)
        result = hasher.digest()

    encoder = DES.new(result[:8], DES.MODE_CBC, result[8:16])
    encrypted = encoder.encrypt(plaintext_to_encrypt.encode('latin-1'))  #encoded plaintext

    print (str(base64.b64encode(encrypted),'utf-8'))

    decoder = DES.new(result[:8], DES.MODE_CBC, result[8:])
    d = str(decoder.decrypt(encrypted),'utf-8')
    print (re.sub(r'[\x01-\x08]','',d))

"4975843","How to encrypt a serialized object with DES(CBC mode) in Java?","I was reading this article about serialization.
It was the first time I saw encrypting a serialized object.
I'm trying to encrypt some serializable object and then save them into a file.
But the article's example uses ECB mode which is known to reveal informations about the encrypted plaintext. I was wondering, how is it possible to encrypt a serialized object
by using CBC instead of ECB mode?
In order to use CBC, an initial vector is needed. This vector must be saved with the serialized object, but if the vector gets encrypted then we can't find the vector in order to decrypt the object.
Also, is it possible to say that the initial vector will be saved as plaintext in the file where the serialiazable object is saved. But then wouldn't the file be destroyed?
An example using CBC mode would be very useful.
","There's a decent SO question and answer about using 3DES here.   The IV is a digest of the password/key.  The solution cited there can be augmented with the appropriate serialization mechanics to a ByteArrayOutputStream or directly to/from a FileOutputStream.

","If you perform encryption using a HSM then the encryption procedure is performed within the HSM, not in the software. Cipher does not implement the encryption procedure itself. The underlying CipherSpi of the PKCS#11 provider for Cipher is chosen using delayed provider selection depending on the key given during the call to init(). So although the desEncrypt() function seems to perform the same operations, in reality the functionality depends on the provider, and in your case, on the PKCS#11 wrapper, library and of course HSM.
Now PKCS#11 is an interface specification; not all mechanisms in PKCS#11 will be implemented in every token. It is likely that some encryption algorithms are too obscure or too unsafe. The latter is probably the case for DES ECB as that algorithm is extremely insecure. That does not mean that DES keys cannot be used in general - they could still play a role in e.g. MAC calculations. So please check the documentation of your HSM if DES ECB is supported (in the current setting).
You can get more information about the PKCS#11 method calls by adding -Djava.security.debug=sunpkcs11 to your call to the Java interpreter (java or javaw). If DES does not work, try the much safer and more common ""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"" or triple DES mechanism.

"13869034","DES encrypt/decrypt from a file","I am writting a program where I take a string, encrypt it and then write it in a file. Then later, I read from the file the string, decrypt it and then modify it. Here's my code for DES encryption/decryption:
/* class for crypting and decrypting a file */
class DESEncrypter
{
private Cipher encryptionCipher;
private Cipher decryptionCipher;

public DESEncrypter (SecretKey key) throws Exception
{
encryptionCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding"");
encryptionCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
decryptionCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding"");
decryptionCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key);
}

/* write to 'out' the encryption of the information read from 'in' */
public String encrypt(String unencryptedString)
{
    String encryptedString = """";

    try {
        byte[] unencryptedByteArray = unencryptedString.getBytes(""UTF8"");

        byte[] encryptedBytes = this.encryptionCipher.doFinal(unencryptedByteArray);

        encryptedString = new sun.misc.BASE64Encoder().encode(encryptedBytes);

    } catch (Exception ex) {
        Logger.getLogger(DESEncrypter.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);
    }

    return encryptedString;
}

private static String bytes2String(byte[] bytes)
{

    StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer();
    for (int i = 0; i < bytes.length; i++) 
    {
        stringBuffer.append((char) bytes[i]);
    }

    return stringBuffer.toString();
}

/* write to 'out' the information obtained by decrypting the information read from 'in' */
public String decrypt (String encryptedString) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
{
    byte[] unencryptedByteArray = new byte[4096];

    try {
        // Encode bytes to base64 to get a string
        byte[] decodedBytes = new sun.misc.BASE64Decoder().decodeBuffer(encryptedString);

       // Decrypt
       unencryptedByteArray = this.decryptionCipher.doFinal(decodedBytes);     
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        Logger.getLogger(DESEncrypter.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);
    }

    return bytes2String(unencryptedByteArray);
}
} 

And this is the function where I write a encrypted String in a file:
public void writeToFileEncrypted(String filename, String owner, String departament)
{
try 
    {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(new File(""files_encrypted"")));
        String crypt = """";
        String aux;
        while ((aux = br.readLine()) != null)
        {
            crypt += aux;
        }
        br.close();

        String info = this.server.crypt.decrypt(crypt);
        info += filename + "" "" + owner + "" "" + departament + ""\n"";

        /* delete the old encryption */
        File temp = new File(""files_encrypted"");
        temp.delete();

        String infoCrypt = this.server.crypt.encrypt(info); 

        File newFiles = new File(""files_encrypted"");
        if (newFiles.createNewFile() == false) 
        {
    log.severe(""Failed to re-create the 'files_encrypted' file when trying to add a new file"");
    return; 
        }

        BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(newFiles));
        bw.write(infoCrypt);
        bw.close();
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        log.warning(""An exception was caught while trying to remove '"" + clientName + ""' from the banned list"");
        e.printStackTrace();
        return;
}
}

While the server runs, I can make modification to that String from file(run that function many time). The problem is when I close the server and then I open it again because I get the error:
javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Given final block not properly padded
This is how I read from file when the server opens:
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(new File(""files_encrypted"")));
String crypto = new String();
String aux;
while ((aux = br.readLine()) != null)
{
    crypto += aux;
    readBytes++;
}
br.close();
System.out.println(readBytes);
info = this.crypt.decrypt(crypto); 

Why do I get that error? What I'm doing wrong? I must write the encrypted String in file some other way?
LATER EDIT:
I've changed the function that read a String from a file, decrypt it, modify it , encrypt it and then write it in file.
public void writeToFileEncrypted(String filename, String owner, String departament)
{
try 
    {
        File f = new File(""files_encrypted"");
        int nrRead = 0;
        String info = null;
        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(f);
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
        int ch;
        while ((ch = fis.read()) != -1)
        {
            sb.append((char)ch);
            nrRead++;
        }
        fis.close();

        StringBuilder sba = null;
        if (nrRead != 0)
        {
            info = this.server.crypt.decrypt(new String(sb.toString().getBytes(""UTF-8""), ""UTF-8""));
            sba = new StringBuilder(info);
            sba.append(filename + "" "" + owner + "" "" + departament + "" "");
        }
        else
        {
            sba = new StringBuilder(filename + "" "" + owner + "" "" + departament + "" "");
        }

        /* delete the old encryption */
        File temp = new File(""files_encrypted"");
        temp.delete();
        //System.out.println(""before: "" + sba.toString());
        String infoCrypt = this.server.crypt.encrypt(sba.toString()); 
        //System.out.println(""after: "" + infoCrypt);
        File newFiles = new File(""files_encrypted"");
        if (newFiles.createNewFile() == false) 
        {
    log.severe(""Failed to re-create the 'files_encrypted' file when trying to add a new file"");
    return; 
        }

        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(newFiles);
        fos.write(infoCrypt.getBytes(""UTF-8""));
        fos.flush();
        fos.close();
    }
    catch (Exception e)

        e.printStackTrace();
        return;
}
}

I've also modified where I read the info from file when server opens for the first time:
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(f);
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
int ch;
while ((ch = fis.read()) != -1)
{
    sb.append((char)ch);
    readBytes++;
}

fis.close();
if (readBytes != 0)
{
    System.out.println(""on: "" + sb.toString());
    info = this.crypt.decrypt(new String(sb.toString().getBytes(""UTF-8""), ""UTF-8""));                
    System.out.println(""load: "" + info);
}
} 

At the System.out.println with ""on: "" what I read from file is exactly what I've written encrypted, without any spaces or new lines. If I read with read(buffer), where buffer is byte[], it seems that adds a lot of spaces.
Although I've made all this modifications I still get the error javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Given final block not properly padded

","You have several problems. The reading and decrypting process should be symmetric with the encrypting and writing process. But

you transform your String into a byte[] using getBytes(""UTF8""), which is fine, but you don't use new String(byte[], ""UTF8"") to do the reverse operation.
you write a whole String to a file, including potential line breaks, but you read it line by line and concatenate each line, thus losing the line breaks in the process. You must read each and every char that has been written.

Also, relying on undocumented, unsupported classes like sun.misc.Base64Encoder/Decoder shouldn't be done. Use Apache commons-codec to find a documented Base64 encoding, guaranteed to still be there when the next JDK comes out, and which can be used on every JVM, including non-Sun JVMs.

While the server runs, I can make modification to that String from file(run that function many time). The problem is when I close the server and then I open it again because I get the error:
javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Given final block not properly padded
This is how I read from file when the server opens:
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(new File(""files_encrypted"")));
String crypto = new String();
String aux;
while ((aux = br.readLine()) != null)
{
    crypto += aux;
    readBytes++;
}
br.close();
System.out.println(readBytes);
info = this.crypt.decrypt(crypto); 

Why do I get that error? What I'm doing wrong? I must write the encrypted String in file some other way?
LATER EDIT:
I've changed the function that read a String from a file, decrypt it, modify it , encrypt it and then write it in file.
public void writeToFileEncrypted(String filename, String owner, String departament)
{
try 
    {
        File f = new File(""files_encrypted"");
        int nrRead = 0;
        String info = null;
        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(f);
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
        int ch;
        while ((ch = fis.read()) != -1)
        {
            sb.append((char)ch);
            nrRead++;
        }
        fis.close();

        StringBuilder sba = null;
        if (nrRead != 0)
        {
            info = this.server.crypt.decrypt(new String(sb.toString().getBytes(""UTF-8""), ""UTF-8""));
            sba = new StringBuilder(info);
            sba.append(filename + "" "" + owner + "" "" + departament + "" "");
        }
        else
        {
            sba = new StringBuilder(filename + "" "" + owner + "" "" + departament + "" "");
        }

        /* delete the old encryption */
        File temp = new File(""files_encrypted"");
        temp.delete();
        //System.out.println(""before: "" + sba.toString());
        String infoCrypt = this.server.crypt.encrypt(sba.toString()); 
        //System.out.println(""after: "" + infoCrypt);
        File newFiles = new File(""files_encrypted"");
        if (newFiles.createNewFile() == false) 
        {
    log.severe(""Failed to re-create the 'files_encrypted' file when trying to add a new file"");
    return; 
        }

        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(newFiles);
        fos.write(infoCrypt.getBytes(""UTF-8""));
        fos.flush();
        fos.close();
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        log.warning(""An exception was caught while trying to remove '"" + clientName + ""' from the banned list"");
        e.printStackTrace();
        return;
}
}

I've also modified where I read the info from file when server opens for the first time:
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(f);
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
int ch;
while ((ch = fis.read()) != -1)
{
    sb.append((char)ch);
    readBytes++;
}

fis.close();
if (readBytes != 0)
{
    System.out.println(""on: "" + sb.toString());
    info = this.crypt.decrypt(new String(sb.toString().getBytes(""UTF-8""), ""UTF-8""));                
    System.out.println(""load: "" + info);
}
} 

At the System.out.println with ""on: "" what I read from file is exactly what I've written encrypted, without any spaces or new lines. If I read with read(buffer), where buffer is byte[], it seems that adds a lot of spaces.
Although I've made all this modifications I still get the error javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Given final block not properly padded
Has somebody any idea what's going on here?
","There are a few things here. 
private static String bytes2String(byte[] bytes)

Is dodgy, you are casting a byte to a char in this method so there is no character encoding specified here. To convert bytes to characters you should just use the String constructor that takes an array of bytes and an encoding. e.g.
    byte[] tmp = new byte[10];      
    String a = new String(tmp, ""UTF-8"");

Be careful using BufferedReaders + .readLine() - this will strip out any newline characters from your file as you read it unless you add them back into your buffer. Although I don't think this is your problem.
But I think the best way to simplify your code is to write the encoded bytes via an OutputStream directly to the file. Unless you need to send the contents of the file over a transport that doesn't like binary data, there is no need to base64 encode. Just use Input/OutputStreams to write the encrypted bytes direct to disk.
RESPONSE TO LATER EDIT:
You are still mixing up your use of binary data (bytes) and character data (String/chars). You can't do things like:
    int ch;
    while ((ch = fis.read()) != -1)
    {
        sb.append((char)ch);

The input stream is retuning bytes, a byte is not a character and just casting it to one is going to cause problems. When using encryption the output from the encryption operation is binary data, and the input to the decryption operation is also binary data. The fact that your are encrypting text is something you deal with before the encryption occurs, and after the decryption occurs. You basic operation should go along the following lines.

Take the text you want to encrypt and convert it to bytes, specifying an encoding using the .getBytes(String charsetName) on your String.
Pass these bytes into your encryption routine
Write the resulting bytes directly to disk

To decrypt:

Read the bytes from the file
Pass the bytes to your decryption routine (as bytes! no Strings/ text involved)
Take the out put bytes and re-construct you String using new String(byte[] bytes, String charsetName) specifying the same encoding as before. 

You might find the following (untested, but should work) methods useful:
public byte[] readBinaryFile(File f) throws IOException
{       
    byte[] contents = new byte[(int)f.length()];
    BufferedInputStream bis = null;
    try
    {
        bis = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(f));
        DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(bis);
        dis.readFully(contents);
    }
    finally
    {
        if(bis != null)
        {
            bis.close();
        }
    }           
    return contents;            
}

public void writeBinaryFile(byte[] contents, File f) throws IOException
{
    BufferedOutputStream bos = null;
    try
    {
        bos = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(f));
        bos.write(contents);
    }
    finally
    {
        if(bos != null)
        {
            bos.close();
        }
    }           
}

So you will also need to change the interface, and internals of your encrypt and decrypt methods so they take and return byte arrays, and ditch the base64 encoding.

","I don't know what the guy that wrote that article was smoking, but:
DESCryptoServiceProvider desCrypto =
   (DESCryptoServiceProvider)DESCryptoServiceProvider.Create();

return ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetString(desCrypto.Key);

will not get you a valid key. At least one problem is the fact that the key you use to encrypt is not the same key that you're using to decrypt, because you can't convert bytes to ASCII and back like that.
If you want to treat the key as a string, what you probably want is:
string keyAsString = Convert.ToBase64String(desCrypto.Key);

Then when you want to turn it back into bytes, instead of ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes, you'll do:
byte[] key = Convert.FromBase64String(keyAsString);

EDIT
There's a ton more wrong with that article too. I'd say ignore that one and find a better example.
EDIT
Here's a very clean basic AES working example that I use for my standard encryption needs. Some of the major improvements over the article are:

Proper creation of a key
Current algorithm (AES 256-bit key)
Random IV
Buffered file access instead of reading/writing the entire file in one chunk
Wrapping all the disposable objects in using

Aside from that, it's the same basic idea.

Because the IV is random, you'll see another small difference in technique. When encrypting the file, you first write the IV to the encrypted file (it's not a secret, so you just write it straight out). When decrypting the file, you read the first few bytes to retrieve the IV, then the rest of the file contains the actual encrypted data. The purpose of a random IV is so the same plaintext file will encrypt into a different encrypted file every time you run it.
The Main method here demonstrates encryption with a random key. If you want to use a password, it's a little more work, but you can implement PBKDF2 with maybe a dozen or so extra lines of code.

","This problem seems to be caused by the way PHP reads keys and data when you supply them as strings. Solve this problem by using code such as the following:
$key = pack('H*', ""0123456789abcdef""); // this correctly maps hex to bytes
$data = pack('H*', ""0123456789abcdef"");
echo bin2hex(mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_DES, $key, $data, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB));

This outputs 56cc09e7cfdc4cef which matches the DES calculator (proof).

For those interested, I also used the following Java code to deduce what was going on. This prints the same result as the PHP:
SecretKey key = new SecretKeySpec(new byte[8], ""DES"");

Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""DES/ECB/NoPadding"");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);

System.out.println(DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(cipher
    .doFinal(new byte[8])));

","You've got a few issues here:

sb.getBytes() does not do what you think it does. What you are expecting is a byte array containing { 0xff, 0xfe, 0x7a, 0x50 }. What you are getting is a byte array containing { 0x46, 0x46, 0x46, 0x45, 0x37, 0x61, 0x35, 0x30 } (assuming you're using UTF-8).
Your choices here would be to either initialise the byte array manually, like so:
byte[] b = new byte[]{ (byte) 0xff, (byte) 0xfe, (byte) 0x7a, (byte) 0x50 };

Or to parse the string correctly. I'm not sure exactly how you'd go about that, but it should be doable (and there will likely be an open-source library to do it for you).
The output javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec@183a2 is not writing out the value of the key. All you're seeing is the toString output of the SecretKeySpec, which follows the format <fully-qualified-class-name>@<hashcode> (see here for details on the toString() method), so the numbers you're seeing, 183a2, are just the hashcode of the SecretKeySpec object, which must not be the key - that would very insecure. To see the value of the key it's holding, you'd need to call the SecretKeySpec#getEncoded() method.
Note that just calling System.out.println(byteArray) will not display the content of the byte array - it will just display the class name and hashcode again. You'll need to either iterate through the array and print out the elements one-by-one, or use another tool to compare the two arrays.

RC4

3DES

Are there other encryption protocols suppoorted by asterisk?
Are there an asterisk command to know the supported encryption protocols?
","With regards to SIP, Asterisk (via chan_sip) supports encryption of both the signalling and the media. Arheops comment that Asterisk 1.8 doesn't support encryption is incorrect; this is true in Asterisk 1.8 and all later versions. For more information, see the Secure Calling section on the Asterisk wiki.
Signalling is encrypted using OpenSSL (yes, the one with the vulnerability. Upgrade if you haven't). It defers encryption of the SIP signalling to OpenSSL. Which cipher is used is dependent on the version of OpenSSL you have installed, as well as what you configure in sip.conf, via the tlscipher option.
;tlscipher=<SSL cipher string>
;        A string specifying which SSL ciphers to use or not use
;        A list of valid SSL cipher strings can be found at:
;                http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html#CIPHER_STRINGS
;

Asterisk supports encryption of the media in one of two ways. The first, supported in Asterisk 1.8 and later, is SDES-SRTP, via the libsrtp library. libsrtp uses AES as the default cipher.
As SDES-SRTP has to exchange keys in plain text in the signalling, another method of encrypting the media is available in Asterisk 11 and later, DTLS-SRTP. This uses OpenSSL's DTLS capabilities (available in more recent versions) to exchange the keys between the participants in the encrypted media stream. Note that this is the mechanism mandated by WebRTC (whereas SDES-SRTP got slapped down with a ""SHOULD NOT"" be implemented).
On a final note, in Asterisk 12, the new SIP stack (based on PJSIP), also supports all of these various encryption mechanisms.

Can someone give an example of how to encrypt these with setkey/encrypt and get the same result as I would from the java code?

","Don't use crypt(). It uses some non-standard algorithm so it will be very difficult to interoperate with other systems. Besides, DES is not secure anyway. 
I suggest you use OpenSSL in C. Most of its ciphers are compatible with JCE.

   com.sun.security.auth.module.Crypt

","Because you're calling Cipher.getInstance with just the string ""DES"", you're not specifying a cipher mode or padding method.  This means you get the defaults, which depends on what Java cryptography provider you're using - you need to know exactly what they are to write compatible C.  (You really should be specifying them rather than relying on defaults).
If you're using the SunJCE provider, then the defaults for DES are ECB mode and PKCS #5 padding.  The best way to do this is probably to use OpenSSL or another meaty crypto library - but if you want to use functions that are usually found in the standard C library on UNIX-type platforms, the ecb_crypt family of functions is going to be a lot easier to work with than the setkey / encrypt family.
You will need to add PKCS#5 padding when encrypting, and check it (and discard it) when decrypting).  The following ecb_pkcs5_encrypt function should do the rough equivalent of the above Java code using those functions.

UPDATED QUESTION 
I have tested the above solution from CodeInChaos. 
It does give me back a 64 bit result. But still there is something wrong.
Here is my updated code.
The keyblock value is abababababababab
and the data block value is 215135734068666F.
The resultant 64 bit result should be XOR'ed with the data block again.
The final answer is suppose to be 414945DD33C97C47 but I get 
288a08c01a57ed3d. 
Why does it not come out right? 
Here is the specifications in suppliers documentation for the encryption.
Encryption is DEA in accordance with FIPS 46-3, single DES in ECB mode, using a single 64-
bit DES Key with odd parity.
$      public static string DESEncrypt(string keyBlock,string dataBlock){
        DES desEncrypt = new DESCryptoServiceProvider();
        byte[] keyBlockBytes = BitConverter.GetBytes(Convert.ToInt64(keyBlock, 16));
        byte[] dataBlockBytes = BitConverter.GetBytes(Convert.ToInt64(dataBlock, 16));
        desEncrypt.Mode = CipherMode.ECB;
        desEncrypt.Key = keyBlockBytes;
        desEncrypt.Padding = PaddingMode.None;
        ICryptoTransform transForm = desEncrypt.CreateEncryptor();
        MemoryStream enecryptedStream = new MemoryStream();
        CryptoStream cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(enecryptedStream, transForm, CryptoStreamMode.Write);
        cryptoStream.Write(dataBlockBytes, 0, dataBlockBytes.Length);
        cryptoStream.FlushFinalBlock();
        byte[] encryptedData = enecryptedStream.ToArray();
        string enCryptedHex = BitConverter.ToString(encryptedData);
        enCryptedHex = enCryptedHex.Replace(""-"", """");
        long iDeaEncrypt = Convert.ToInt64(enCryptedHex, 16);
        long iDataBlock = Convert.ToInt64(dataBlock, 16);
        long decoderKey = iDeaEncrypt ^ iDataBlock;
        string decKeyHex = Convert.ToString(decoderKey, 16);
        return decKeyHex;
    }

","I think you need to set the padding to PaddingMode.None:
desEncrypt.Padding = PaddingMode.None;

But you should really think hard, if DES and ECB is really what you want.

b.t.w.
byte[] encryptedData = new byte[enecryptedStream.Length];
encryptedStream.Position = 0;
encryptedStream.Read(encryptedData, 0, encryptedData.Length);

can be replaced by:
encryptedData = encryptedStream.ToArray();

"15443591","Mangler function for DES?","The Mangler function takes as input 32 bits, and expands it to 48 bits.  It does this breaking the 32 bits in 8 4 bit chunks and concatenating the left and right bits to each chunk.  My question is this.  Where do the first four bit chunk get the left bit from?  Would it take it from the last bit of the last chunk?  Or would it simply concatenate a 0.  This applies to the last 4 bit chunk as well, except they would need to get the right bit which does not exist.
Thanks  
","The Expansion Function takes the last bit from the last ""chunk"" and prepends it to the first ""chunk"" and the last ""chunk"" gets its rightmost bit from the leftmost bit in the first ""chunk"".

"39446834","How many keys does Triple DES encryption need?","I am porting some C# code to C++, and trying to encrypt a textfile with Triple DES encryption. But I am confused; some encryption APIs only require one key for Triple DES (C# for example: How to implement Triple DES in C# (complete example) ), while others require 2 or 3 keys (in several C++ implementations I've found). 
Why is that?
","The TDEA keying is maybe better understood here considering the key length over just a simple key. Depending on the keying option used, it can be a single key length, double key length, or triple key length. All parts are required and would constitute the ""key bundle"".
The TDEA is basically three applications of the DES cipher. Each part of the ""key bundle"" is used with one or more executions of the DES cipher algorithm (see also the Feistel cipher);

for a single key, it is used three times (equates to classic DES but is no longer recommended), K1 = K2 = K3;
for a double key, the first part of the key is used twice, K1 and K2 are independent and K3 = K1;
and for the triple key length, each key part is used once, all parts are independent.

What you are seeing as ""two"" (or ""three"") keys is most likely the double (or triple) key length being used, each part being provided separately.
The documentation for each API should provide details on how the keys are provided/expected.
A few test cases to check interoperability never hurt either.

Some background/context on how TDEA works; source Wikipedia;

Triple DES uses a ""key bundle"" that comprises three DES keys, K1, K2 and K3, each of 56 bits (excluding parity bits)...
The encryption algorithm is:
ciphertext = EK3(DK2(EK1(plaintext)))
I.e., DES encrypt with K1, DES decrypt with K2, then DES encrypt with K3.
Decryption is the reverse:
plaintext = DK1(EK2(DK3(ciphertext)))
I.e., decrypt with K3, encrypt with K2, then decrypt with K1.
Each triple encryption encrypts one block of 64 bits of data.

Why is that?
","Niall's answer is correct, but to me it felt like a little bit more information would help your understanding of the problem better.
3DES is alternately referred to in some specifications as DES-EDE, which is DES-Encrypt/Decrypt/Encrypt.
var x = Encrypt(key1, input);
x = Decrypt(key2, x);
x = Encrypt(key3, x);
return x;

So 3DES always requires 3 keys, each of which are have 56 key bits stretched into 64 bits (8 bytes) because every 7 bits gets a 1 bit parity check. This is frequently expressed as one 192-bit value (24 bytes) value, or an intermediate 128-bit value (16 bytes).

If the 3DES key is 64 bits (which has a key strength of 56 bits, and many implementations will reject)


k1 = key
k2 = key
k3 = key

If the 3DES key is 128 bits (which has a key strength of 112 bits)


k1 = key[0..7]
k2 = key[8..15]
k3 = k1

If the 3DES key is 192 bits (which has a key strength of 168 bits)


k1 = key[0..7]
k2 = key[8..15]
k3 = key[16..23]


So if we have a 64-bit 3DES key we encrypt with the key, then decrypt with the key (returning the original data) and then encrypt with the key again. That makes ""one key"" 3DES equivalent to (1)DES.
Note that the DES-equivalent behavior can happen for two-key 3DES if k2 is coincidentally k1, (or 3-key if k1=k2=k3) so using 3DES isn't always an upgrade over using DES.
As for why the implementations differ: In C# arrays are length tagged, so passing one array the recipient can check if you are passing 8, 16, or 24 bytes. In C arrays aren't length tagged, so the API needs to either ask you how long your data is (which is what Windows CAPI and CNG do) or just take three different key pointers, and make you do the fragment cloning for 1-key and 2-key keys.

I had a doubt previously about converting a 64 bit key to 56 bit key, and could do that successfully, thanks to some guidance received here.
I have divided my implementation into the key-gen phase (where I generate a new key for each of the 16 rounds) and the encryption phase.
However, I am not able to generate the correct keys.
I did an example manually using ""abcdefgh"" as key and I am not able to reproduce the results in my program.
The DES keygen phase involves:

Dividing 56-bit key into 2 28 bit keys. I store 28 bits in 4 bytes as leftkey28[4] (which has the last 4 bits as 0) & rightkey28[4] (which has the first 4 bits as 0)
These 28 bit groups are left circular shifted using (<< 1 & << 2 in the original algorithm and then combined to get a new 56-bit key). However, because of this problem, I scrapped left shifting by 2 for now, and am only left circular shifting by 1. And still, the root of this problem is untraceable.

The problem seems to be in the line Round#2 Byte#2 in my output.
I will be grateful for any guidance or hints towards finding out the root cause.
(
P.S. I have never done so much bit manipulation before!
The code is not optimized or written according to Java rules/conventions as I just wanted to make it work before doing any other things

","The convention with DES is to pretend you have 64 bit keys (8 bytes), but if you want to be really, uhh, pedantic, you clobber the 8th bit of each of these bytes with the parity of preceding 7 bits.
I've only played with Java, and I've seen that Java (Sun/Oracle JRE) doesn't bother checking parity.  It just ignores the 8th bit of each byte.
Maybe the DESEngine in BouncyCastle will be of some help to you.  The generateWorkingKey() method looks interesting:

"7045756","DES Implementation in Java: Error during Key Generation Phase","I am a student doing a mini-project - DES implementation.
I had a doubt previously about converting a 64 bit key to 56 bit key, and could do that successfully, thanks to some guidance received here.
I have divided my implementation into the key-gen phase (where I generate a new key for each of the 16 rounds) and the encryption phase.
However, I am not able to generate the correct keys.
I did an example manually using ""abcdefgh"" as key and I am not able to reproduce the results in my program.
The DES keygen phase involves:

Dividing 56-bit key into 2 28 bit keys. I store 28 bits in 4 bytes as leftkey28[4] (which has the last 4 bits as 0) & rightkey28[4] (which has the first 4 bits as 0)
These 28 bit groups are left circular shifted using (<< 1 & << 2 in the original algorithm and then combined to get a new 56-bit key). However, because of this problem, I scrapped left shifting by 2 for now, and am only left circular shifting by 1. And still, the root of this problem is untraceable.

The problem seems to be in the line Round#2 Byte#2 in my output.
I will be grateful for any guidance or hints towards finding out the root cause.
(
P.S. I have never done so much bit manipulation before!
The code is not optimized or written according to Java rules/conventions as I just wanted to make it work before doing any other things
)
Thanks in advance.

","It looks like you had it right in the first place (sort of):
// rightKey28[0] = (byte) (key56[3] & 00001111);

But you replaced it with subtraction: 
rightKey28[0] = (byte) (key56[3] - leftKey28[3]);

If you want the first byte of rightKey28 to have its four least-order bits set, your original code was (almost) correct; the new code is wrong.
The ""sort of"" and ""almost"" refer to the fact that binary literals are not supported until Java 7. So ""11110000"" is a decimal integer, with a binary pattern of 101010011000011001110000. It almost works by coincidence, but you miss the highest order bit; I think what you want here is 0xF0 (and 0x0F for the low order bits).
Also, these parts looks suspect:
circularBit = (byte) (rightKey28[0] & (1 << 3));
circularBit <<= 4;

This is moving the ""circular"" bit to the high order position in the byte: X000000.
But later you shift it right only 3 bits:
rightKey28[3] = (byte) (rightKey28[3] << 1);
rightKey28[3] = (byte) (rightKey28[3] | ((((int) circularBit) & 0xff) >>> 3));

If rightKey28[3] starts with a bit pattern ABCDEFGH, it will end up with pattern BCDYFGH0, where Y is the logical result of X | E. Don't you really want BCDEFGHX? If so, you right shift circularBit by 7 bits.
Finally, note that rightKey[0] will have 5 bits set, because you shift the 4 bits it starts with left by 1. You may want to mask to ensure only the low order 4 bits contain data:
rightKey28[0] = (byte) ((rightKey28[0] << 1) & 0x0F);

"7045756","DES Implementation in Java: Error during Key Generation Phase","I am a student doing a mini-project - DES implementation.
I had a doubt previously about converting a 64 bit key to 56 bit key, and could do that successfully, thanks to some guidance received here.
I have divided my implementation into the key-gen phase (where I generate a new key for each of the 16 rounds) and the encryption phase.
However, I am not able to generate the correct keys.
I did an example manually using ""abcdefgh"" as key and I am not able to reproduce the results in my program.
The DES keygen phase involves:

Dividing 56-bit key into 2 28 bit keys. I store 28 bits in 4 bytes as leftkey28[4] (which has the last 4 bits as 0) & rightkey28[4] (which has the first 4 bits as 0)
These 28 bit groups are left circular shifted using (<< 1 & << 2 in the original algorithm and then combined to get a new 56-bit key). However, because of this problem, I scrapped left shifting by 2 for now, and am only left circular shifting by 1. And still, the root of this problem is untraceable.

The problem seems to be in the line Round#2 Byte#2 in my output.
I will be grateful for any guidance or hints towards finding out the root cause.
(
P.S. I have never done so much bit manipulation before!
The code is not optimized or written according to Java rules/conventions as I just wanted to make it work before doing any other things
)
Thanks in advance.

","Here's my DES code (incomplete in C).
Well, I tried Java for 2 weeks, and was having trouble with using long for ints, ints for bytes and shorts, etc (for bit manipulation/bit-shifting).
Then, gave up on Java and did this in C. It is the encryption code only.
Hope it helps someone in the future. Let me know if I am incorrect anywhere.
Thanks to all you guys for the help.

","Thanks for your question!
To do this, use the OpenSSL::Cipher library. Here is a link with some sample code for AES: http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/Cipher.html#class-OpenSSL::Cipher-label-Encrypting+and+decrypting+some+data
To use DES, run this command to see if your Ruby installation supports DES.
puts OpenSSL::Cipher.ciphers

","According to this article : http://43n141e.blogspot.tw/2008/08/des-encryption-java-to-openssl-to-ruby.html , I try the following two steps :
1. Calculate iv value in Java:
String key = ""123456""
final byte[] rgbIV = key.getBytes();
final IvParameterSpec iv = new IvParameterSpec(rgbIV);
byte[] ivBytes = iv.getIV();
StringBuffer sbuf = new StringBuffer();
for (byte b : ivBytes) {
    sbuf.append(String.format(""%02x"", (b & 0xFF)));
}
System.out.println(""iv: "" + sbuf);

2. Decrypt in Ruby :
def decode(encryptedString, key, iv)
    decrypt = OpenSSL::Cipher::Cipher.new('des-cbc')
    decrypt.decrypt
    decrypt.key = key
    decrypt.iv = iv.scan(/../).map{|b|b.hex}.pack('c*')
    decrypt.update(encryptedString) + decrypt.final
end

"7855238","Encode / Decode RealVNC password","I'm trying to write C# application that can remotely change the RealVNC password on another box.
What works currently is that I can pull a password from a box that has already been changed, store it as a hex string, and then send it to another box AND then change the password that way but I need to be able to change the password or randomize it on the fly.
I'm having problems with creating the correct binary to place in the registry.
I know the VNC key:
byte[] Key = { 23, 82, 107, 6, 35, 78, 88, 7 };

So using the above key and passing ""1234"" as the password to encrypt using the following code:
public static byte[] EncryptTextToMemory(string Data, byte[] Key)
{
    try
    {
        MemoryStream mStream = new MemoryStream()

        DESCryptoServiceProvider desProvider = new DESCryptoServiceProvider();
        desProvider.Mode = CipherMode.ECB;
        desProvider.Key = Key;

        CryptoStream cStream = new CryptoStream(mStream,
            desProvider.CreateEncryptor(),
            CryptoStreamMode.Write);

        byte[] toEncrypt = new ASCIIEncoding().GetBytes(Data);

        cStream.Write(toEncrypt, 0, toEncrypt.Length);
        cStream.FlushFinalBlock();

        byte[] ret = mStream.ToArray();

        cStream.Close();
        mStream.Close();

        return ret;
    }
    catch (CryptographicException ex)
    {
        MessageBox.Show(""A Cryptographic error occurred: "" + ex.Message);
        return null;
    }

After passing the returned byte array to BitConverter.ToString, I would expect to get the same hex values as stored in the registry of a password already set to 1234 with RealVNC itself, but I'm not.
","Here are my sources to encrypt/decrypt VNC password:

    {
        if (password.Length > 8)
        {

        }
        if (password.Length < 8)
        {
            password = password.PadRight(8, '\0');
        }

        byte[] key = { 23, 82, 107, 6, 35, 78, 88, 7 };
        byte[] passArr = new ASCIIEncoding().GetBytes(password);
        byte[] response = new byte[passArr.Length];
        char[] chars = { '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' };

        // reverse the byte order
        byte[] newkey = new byte[8];
        for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
        {
            // revert desKey[i]:
            newkey[i] = (byte)(

                ((key[i] & 0x80) >> 7)
                );
        }
        key = newkey;
        // reverse the byte order

        DES des = new DESCryptoServiceProvider();
        des.Padding = PaddingMode.None;
        des.Mode = CipherMode.ECB;

        ICryptoTransform enc = des.CreateEncryptor(key, null);
        enc.TransformBlock(passArr, 0, passArr.Length, response, 0);

        string hexString = String.Empty;

        {

            hexString += chars[response[i] & 0xf];
        }
        return hexString.Trim().ToLower();
    }

And to decrypt:

","In the implementations I have seen of DES, I only ever recall seeing plaintext and ciphertext of the same size. Wikipedia seems to confirm this. Since DES works on 64-bit chunks, that would make since as long as the code implementing DES properly pads the input to match those 64-bit boundaries. In fact, that's pretty much the definition of a block cipher (which is what DES is).
Thus I would wager you will see it work flawlessly with the other computer using the size of the encrypted text. A few tests of your own should be able to confirm this absolutely.
Also, I firmly agree with the Jeremy's comment that DES is a poor choice of encryption algorithm for most situations. Triple DES or AES are much better options.

The world is full of bad security systems designed by people who read Applied Cryptography. 


Don't send your own 'encryptyed' stuff on wire. You're missing an HMAC, you're missing a key exchange protocol, you're missing a wire frame protocol (which is exactly the answer to your question 'how do I know the size'). Just use an off-the-shelf protocol like TLS/SSL. gnu-tls offers a easy to use API for SSL/TLS, openssl also supports it but is notoriously cumbersome to use. Whatever you do, don't start writing your own protocol, you'll come up with yet another broken 'encryption' protocol because of a bad key exchange or a 'optimized nonce' or a missing frame signature or whatever.
Here is a simple example using gnu-tls: Simple client example using the C++ API

"20252706","S-DES implementation : how to work with the individual bits?","I have an assignment that asks us to implement S-DES (Simplified DES), and the algorithm includes a lot of bit permutations, shifts as well as XOR-ing.
Obviously, the fastest way to implement this would be using bit operations, such as:
char CLS(char key, int shift){
    char skey;
    skey = (key << shift) | (key >> (8 - shift)) 
    return skey;
}

/* Get 8-bit subkey from 10-bit key */
char permute(short int key){
    short int i;
    short int k1[] = { BIT_6, BIT_3, BIT_7, BIT_4, BIT_8, BIT_5, BIT_10, BIT_9 }; // SDES spec
    char sk1 = '\0';

    for(i = 0; i < 8; i++){
        sk1 = (sk1 << 1) | (key & k1[i]);
    }
}

...

Which is simple enough to do. However, how do I get those bits efficiently? Using something like fread(), I could read at least 1 byte at a time and supply those to the SDES algorithm, but that grossly under-utilizes the CPU, as I'd not only be reading and encrypting only 1 byte at a time, I would also be writing 1 byte of encrypted data to disk at a time! Surely there must be a better way.
The only alternative to this that I could think of was treat each byte as a char array and manipulate the bits that way, but not only does that add memory overhead: I'd still be stuck working with 1 byte at a time and I wouldn't be able to use shift operations and need to instead use temporary arrays and array indices.
I'm looking to improve this behaviour slightly, but all I could think of was bringing bigger blocks into memory. For example, I could use fread() to read 4K blocks of data into a char array[4096] and then work with that as opposed to reading 4096 bytes one-by-one from disk. 
But, I'm not certain if this is all I could do given that it's a simple algorithm. Could further improvements be made, or is this about as good as it gets?
Should anyone want to take a look, here is the specification of the S-DES algorithm. 
","If you want to speed-up your algorithm you could parallelize the encryption on the byte array, for example with OpenMP. As DarkSquirrel42 pointed out in a comment, to gain speed you should also replace your permute function with a function using a look-up table:
#define LUT_SIZE 1024
static char lookup_table[LUT_SIZE];

/* Get 8-bit subkey from 10-bit key */
char permute(short int key)
{
    // SDES spec
    short int k1[] = { BIT_6, BIT_3, BIT_7, BIT_4, BIT_8, BIT_5, BIT_10, BIT_9 }; 
    char sk1 = '\0';

    for (short int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        sk1 = (sk1 << 1) | (key & k1[i]);
    }
    return sk1;
}

void init_lut()
{
    for (short int i = 0; i < LUT_SIZE; i++) {
        lookup_table[i] = permute(i);
    }
}

char permute_fast(short int key)
{
    if (key < 0 || key >= LUT_SIZE) {
        //error handling
        return 0;
    }
    return lookup_table[key];
}

"13245385","Invalid block padding trying to decrypt 2-key triple DES","I am trying to implement 2-key triple DES with crypto++ in C++.
My implementation is based upon the code in the crypto++ wiki located here.
The code on the wiki builds properly; I can see that it is encrypting and decrypting correctly when I run the sample program.
For my implementation, I am trying to do the following:

the user can run ""desimp.exe encrypt test.txt"". The program will encrypt test.txt and then output an encrypted file named test.txt.des . This seems to be working properly.
the user can run ""desimp.exe decrypt test.txt.des"" and the program will decrypt test.txt.des and output the decrypted text to a file ""decrypted.txt"" I can't get this to work. The error that I get is ""StreamTransformationFilter: invalid PKCS #7 block padding found""

I believe I might need to save the data in the iv to a file at the time of encryption as well. Is this correct? I have tried doing this, and I think I'm able to get the iv saved to a file correctly - but I think in order to read in the iv to be used to for decryption, it needs to be read in as an array of 8 bytes. The file size of test.txt.iv when I attempt to save the iv is 21 bytes. If this is the right approach, I'm not sure how to proceed.

","Michael, There are few mistakes I found in your code. Check the line cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, generateSecretKey(key), ivspec); You need to pass the same key as initialization vector,but not IV you have. The des.exe program is based on source code of LibDes library. You can find all the details in the documentation and source code. You have mention des -D parameter. It means you need to decrypt DES with CBC/NoPadding mode. Check also the _oddParityTable method you have. 
If your file is not UUdecoded omit the related part in my code. 
Here is ready Java example:

    public static void main (String[] args) throws Exception

One left shift is fine for now!
NOTE: This pertains to the bitarray package.
","You could use slicing:
def leftshift(ba, count):
    return ba[count:] + (bitarray('0') * count)

def rightshift(ba, count):
    return (bitarray('0') * count) + ba[:-count]

These maintain the bit-width of the input, dropping bits on one end and padding with 0 on the other.
You can create your own subclass of the bitarray type:
class mybitarray(bitarray):
    def __lshift__(self, count):
        return self[count:] + type(self)('0') * count
    def __rshift__(self, count):

    def __repr__(self):

Demo:
>>> c0 = mybitarray(c0)
>>> c0
mybitarray('1111011111111111111111110001')
>>> c0 << 4
mybitarray('0111111111111111111100010000')

But it's not working.
When we do not specify mode of operation(i.e. CBC/ECB) and padding method(i.e. PKCS5Padding/NoPadding) and only algorithm name is specified for getting instance of Cipher then what are the default values which Android and Java use?

Does Android uses CBC by default? As it doesn't give error for IV. If I specify IV in init method and don't specify mode in my java project, it throws exception as IV cannot be used for ECB.

Thanks.
","Both Android and Java default to ""AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding"". Both your key and IV are not of the correct size (so the code should not even run!) and you forget to perform (character) encoding/decoding correctly. Especially the ciphertext should never be directly converted into a string, as unprintable characters are likely to be dropped or converted.

Can you please clarify to me why the cipher length is 44 while the original message length is 24?
EDIT:
Kindly, I need the answer with clarification. The cipher always ends with =. Could this be because of the padding? Can you explain to me why/how the cipher is resulted with this length? And always ends with =? 
Is my code correct or there is a mistake? I have doubts in the encoding part.
","There are several things going on:

msg.getBytes() returns the bytes representing an encoding of the string using the ""platform's default charset"" (e.g. could be UTF-8 or UTF-16 or ..): specify the encoding manually to avoid confusion! In any case, see msgBytes.length to get the true plain text length.
DES, being a block cypher, will have output padded along a block size boundary - but this will always be larger than the plain text (refer to msgBytes.length) length when using PKCS#5 because the plain text is always padded with [1,8] bytes. To see what the true encrypted size is, see textEncrypted.length.
The encrypted bytes are encoded using base-64 and this process - which is independent of the encryption - inflates the number of bytes required by about 33% (as only 6 bits per character/byte are used). The Java base-64 implementation also adds padding which is where the trailing ""="" character is introduced.

As long as you (or someone else with the correct algorithm and cipher key) can retrieve the initial string - by performing the inverse of each step in reverse order, then it works. If a particular step does not have an inverse/reverse operation or cannot be ""undone"", then something is wrong; but this also means that every step can be individually tested.

To the numbers!

msg.getBytes() returns an ASCII/UTF-8 encoded sequence (if it used UTF-16 or another another ""wide"" encoding then the numbers below would be too large)
Therefore, msgBytes.length is 24
And since msgBytes.length mod 8 is 0, the plain text is padded with 8 bytes that have the value of 0x08 (per CKCS#5)
Thus, textEncrypted.length is 32 (24 data + 8 padding)
Due to base-64 encoding, 32 bytes * 1.33 ~ 43 characters
And with base-64 padding (=), the final result is 44 characters!

"19462675","DES encryption plain vs. cipher length","I am using Java to make a toy program that encrypts a message using DES encryption. The message I want to encrypt is:
String msg=""This is a secret message"";

Which I convert to bytes as:
byte [] msgBytes=msg.getBytes();

And send it to encrypt function that works as follows:
//encryption function
public static String encryptMsg(byte [] msgBytes, SecretKey myDesKey) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchPaddingException, InvalidKeyException, IllegalBlockSizeException, BadPaddingException
{
    Cipher desCipher;
    // Create the cipher

// converts to base64 for easier display.
byte[] base64Cipher = Base64.encode(textEncrypted);
return new String(base64Cipher);

Encrypted Message: FDCU+kgWz25urbQB5HbFtqm0HqWHGlGBHlwwEatFTiI=
Original msg length: 24
Encrypted msg length: 44

Can you please clarify to me why the cipher length is 44 while the original message length is 24?
EDIT:
Kindly, I need the answer with clarification. The cipher always ends with =. Could this be because of the padding? Can you explain to me why/how the cipher is resulted with this length? And always ends with =? 
Is my code correct or there is a mistake? I have doubts in the encoding part.
","The result of a DES encryption will always be a multiple of 8 bytes. The input is also padded to a multiple of 8 bytes according to the padding algorithm specified.
The base 64 encoding encodes each 3 bytes into 4 characters (3x8 = 4x6 = 24), and ensures the output length is a multiple of 4 by padding with = characters. 
So, the 44 characters output corresponds to 33 bytes, but the = at the end indicates that in fact there were only 32 bytes. Which is fine, since 24 bytes clear data with PKCS5 padding becomes 32 bytes.

Is there any reason to use 16 rounds other than for more security? 
","I do not know specifically why the number 16 was chosen. However, one would surmise that at that time, cryptanalysis would have shown that 16 rounds provided an 'adequate' amount of security based on the performance tradeoff. That is to say that your ""more security"" statement would be correct.
Remember that less rounds means it is easier to brute-force because it takes less time and is less expensive to expand out the pipeline in dedicated hardware. More rounds on the other hand do make it harder to crack, but it is more computationally expensive across the board. This means that (especially in those days, remember DES dates back to the 1970s) it is more expensive/time-consuming - this means for the ""good guys"" (those who know the key and are legitimately using the cypher) too.
Therefore it is always important to find the ""right balance"" between performance and security. The most common guideline being ""by the time the cyphertext is cracked, the value of the encrypted information has decreased to a point where it does not matter"". That is, encryption will never protect data forever due to increasingly available computing power and diminishing costs, but it should be designed to last long enough.

","You would have to ask the designers, but the wikipedia article contains this quote:

There have also been attacks proposed against reduced-round versions of the cipher, that is, versions of DES with fewer than 16 rounds. Such analysis gives an insight into how many rounds are needed for safety, and how much of a ""security margin"" the full version retains. Differential-linear cryptanalysis was proposed by Langford and Hellman in 1994, and combines differential and linear cryptanalysis into a single attack. An enhanced version of the attack can break 9-round DES with 215.8 chosen plaintexts and has a 229.2 time complexity (Biham and others, 2002).

Which suggests to me that 16 rounds was simply a tradeoff between security and performance.
The fact that 16 is a power of two could simplify things, also.

"1116350","What is DES-X?","What is DES-X?
And
DES-X and DES, are they backwards compatible?
","Well, DES-X is a variant of the DES block cipher (as I'm sure you already knew).
The reason for the introduction of the DES-X was an attempt to increase the security of the original DES algorithm (which was limited to a 56bit key). The proposed solution with DEX-X was to use two more 64-bit keys which would be applied to make it harder for an attacker to guess the key of the DES algorithm. Basically, the first additional key is XORed to the plain text which is then encrypted with DES. The second additional key is XORed to the resulting cypher.
However, as far the backwards compatibility.. I'm not sure what you mean by that? If you're asking if you can use DES to decrypt DES-X messages then NO (it the strict sense). If you're asking whether a DES-X implementation could be configured to encrypt/decrypt DES messages then the answer is YES.
Here's an example:

    DES(msg) = CYPHER
    DES-X(msg) = K2 X DES(K1 x msg) = CYPER-X

If you choose K2 and K1 to be the all 0 then:

    DES-x(msg) = K2 x DES(K1 x msg) [where K1 = 0, K2 =0] = DES(msg)

It should be pointed out that what I mean by making K1 and K2 0 is actually choosing a key which is 64 bits of 0 = {0,0,0,0,0...0} (64 times). Such a key does not modify the plaintext of the cypher at all when the XOR operation is applied.

Is there a specific algorithm that is used by DEScalc.jar which I am missing, because of which I don't get the results obtained by DEScalc.jar

Hi Everyone,
                 Thanks a lot for your help; The issue was with the way I represented the hexadecimal in python; I used the following function to convert ""0123456789abcdef"" to hex representation as Keith mentioned and it worked:
def HexToByte( hexStr ):
    """"""
    Convert a string hex byte values into a byte string. The Hex Byte values may
    or may not be space separated.
    """"""
    # The list comprehension implementation is fractionally slower in this case    
    #
    #    hexStr = ''.join( hexStr.split("" "") )
    #    return ''.join( [""%c"" % chr( int ( hexStr[i:i+2],16 ) ) \
    #                                   for i in range(0, len( hexStr ), 2) ] )

    bytes = []

    hexStr = ''.join( hexStr.split("" "") )

    for i in range(0, len(hexStr), 2):
        bytes.append( chr( int (hexStr[i:i+2], 16 ) ) )

    return ''.join( bytes )

Thanks a lot
","The problem here is in your source (plaintext) string. You have each character expanded to two bytes, instead of one byte. The Java program will take the input ""0123456789abcdef"", and use internally the hex string of that. Using pycrypto and a properly encoded plaintext I get this.
Python2> from Crypto.Cipher import DES
Python2> key
'\xfe\x9b\xd5\x16\xcd\x15\xc8I'
Python2> pw
'\x01#Eg\x89\xab\xcd\xef'
Python2> eng = DES.new(key, DES.MODE_ECB, ""\0""*8)
Python2> hexdigest(eng.encrypt(pw))
'c337cd5cbd44fc97'

Which you can see is the same as the Java code.

","Originally there was NBS Special Publication 500-20, revised in 1980, Validating the Correctness of Hardware Implementations of the NBS Data Encryption Standard (The author has made it available at https://archive.org/details/validatingcorrec00gait ).
Then there is NIST Special PUB 800-17, Modes of Operation Validation System (MOVS):
Requirements and Procedures, covering FIPS PUB 46-2 (DES) as well as Skipjack. http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-17/800-17.pdf .
There's also NIST Special PUB 800-20, Modes of Operation Validation System for the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TMOVS): Requirements and Procedures. http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-20/800-20.pdf .
There may be other publications such as NIST Special Publication 800-67, Recommendation for the TripleData Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) Block Cipher, http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-67-Rev1/SP-800-67-Rev1.pdf, found at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html .
Having implemented DES numerous times in software and a couple of times in VHDL, it's in understanding that the DES standard originally described conformance to the hardware implementation patented by IBM in 1977. (see vhdl_des.tar.gz, which is a simple implementation with an 8 bit interface.  There's a pdf file than includes a description of the I/O permutations.)
To save you the typing the test vectors from FIPS SP PUB 500-20 can be found here des.test.   There may be a parity error in one of the keys, I can never keep track of which of these files is where (des -tv < des.test, a software implementation).  Someone laboriously typed them in by hand from Numerical Recipes in C, where someone had gotten them from 500-20.

","As noticed by @Brian_Sidebotham , using char str[10];buffsize=sizeof(str);...str[buffsize++]='\0' is not a good thing in c. Writing beyond the end of an array may trigger undefined behavior. It could work or deliver wrong results or stop due to a segmentation fault. So the first thing to do is to work with larger buffers. For instance :
char key[9];
sprintf(key,""12345678"");

char password[420];
sprintf(password,""i am not going to write my password here."");

Notice that it is 9, not 8, to leave some place for the null terminating character \0 that is automatically added by sprintf() to build a valid c string. 
Moreover, the last parameter of cbc_crypt() is not the output. It is not the encrypted string but an 8-byte initialization vector for the chaining. That way, if you need to encrypt multiple strings, it prevents regularities in the clear text from appearing in the cipher text. As the cipher text is to be decrypted, the same initialization vector must be provided. Encryption is performed in place : the input string pass will be overwritten by the encrypted text.
Finally, make sure that your strings are large enough because the encrypted text seems to be slightly larger that the clear text.
The following code is expected to work. It is compiled by gcc main.c -o main

Now... A few words about security... According to the wikipedia page about the Data Encryption Standard NBS DES :

DES is now considered to be insecure for many applications. This is mainly due to the 56-bit key size being too small; in January, 1999, distributed.net and the Electronic Frontier Foundation collaborated to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15 minutes

You may switch to the implementation of AES by the openssl library for instance. See How to do encryption using AES in Openssl or Simple AES encryption decryption with openssl library in C or AES (aes-cbc-128, aes-cbc-192, aes-cbc-256) encryption/decryption with openssl C for instance.

Here's what I've tried, but it represents 8 byte key to equivalent 13 byte string:
from Crypto.Cipher import DES
text =(unichr(4).decode('utf-8')*8).encode('utf-8')

key1=(unichr(0x46)+unichr(0xb2)+unichr(0xc8)+unichr(0xb6)+unichr(0x28)+unichr(0x18)+unichr(0xf8)+unichr(0x84)).encode('utf-8')

cipher_text = des.encrypt(plain_text)
print 'the cipher text is ', cipher_text

des = DES.new(key2,DES.MODE_ECB)
print 'the decrypted text is: ', des.decrypt(cipher_text)

","To use the two keys in your example, assign them like this:
key1 = '\x46\xb2\xc8\xb6\x28\x18\xf8\x84'

key2 = '\x4a\x5a\xa8\xd0\xba\x30\x58\x5a'

","As a side note to complement the other answers. If you can, don't use it, use the AESCryptoServiceProvider.

DES is now considered to be insecure
  for many applications. This is chiefly
  due to the 56-bit key size being too
  small; in January, 1999,
  distributed.net and the Electronic
  Frontier Foundation collaborated to
  publicly break a DES key in 22 hours
  and 15 minutes

I need my key to be a fixed (not random) value. That's why I defined it as array of bytes in the beginning. 
My problem is that my decryption function does not return the original message. This means there is a problem in the code and probably the encryption is not proper. I am suspicious about the coding issue as the encryption / decryption is quite straight forward. Can you point the problems in my code?

In the decryption, I changed the encode to decode as suggested by one of the comments. That does not work. I get:

","You're not decoding the encryption of the original message; you're decoding the base64 encoding of the encryption original message.
Rather than passing cipher.getBytes(), you need Base64.decode(cipher).getBytes(), or, alternatively, have the method accept a base64 String and handle the decoding in the method.
Also, there's no need to base64 decode the decrypted content. It will already be in the original encoding. In other words, just return new String(textDecrypted).

The flow you're trying to do is: plaintext -> encrypted content -> base64 -> encrypted content -> plaintext. The flow you're doing is text -> encrypted content -> base64 -> decrypted base64 (nonsense) -> base64 (nonsense)

","I found your problem, but now I am checking why it occurs exactly.
You call des.Clear(); between encrypting and decrypting, if you do not do this, the input and output is the same. 

From Msdn:


When called, the Clear method overwrites all sensitive data within the object with zeros


Thus your masterkey in your DES object is set to zero which is why your output is different.

","This happens because of the Initialisation Vector. This behaviour is there by design. You don't want the encryption algorithm to produce exactly the same output for the same input. Such algorythm is susceptible to plain text attack, where attacker can potentially infer encryption key from the input and the produced output.
This happens in the line
ICryptoTransform ct2 = des.CreateEncryptor();

According to msdn

If the current IV property is null, 
  the GenerateIV method is called to create a new random IV.

To fix this you need to set the IV for your encryptor. You would then store IV alongside the encrypted bytes and use it for decryption. IV, in simple words, is some initial random noise that allows encryption algorithm to produce different input. As a good practise, this noise must be different for each encryption call.
Obviously, DES is a really weak algorithm, you would want to use at least 3DES. But even 3DES is only used for legacy applications. Modern applications use AES.

","Encryption produces bytes, not human readable characters.  To make your bytes human readable, you need to convert them to a different format.  I would suggest Base64 as a common way to do this.
After you have encrypted your file, convert as much of it as you need to Base64 and display the Base64 part.  It will not make any sense, but it won't contain anything too weird.

More Specific: 
I want to create an encrypted/encoded 4 digits number out of 3 string fields. You can imagine it as trying to produce a 4 digit CVV number like in the credit cards, with the help of(in terms of depending from) the card number, the exp. date and the service code. To achive this, i first encrypted the card number using DES with random key, then encrypted(DES) the exp date using the encrypted card number as a key, and as last step, i encrypted(DES) service code using the encrypted exp date as a key. So far, so good, i can retrieve in every step the infoarmations needed. The problem is that the encrypted service code, which will be my final output, shall have the length 4 and shall contains only digits. After two days of researching in the net, after trying several attempts, like: 

hashing : problem was there was no decode back from hash value to encrypted service code
Base64 Transformation : couldn't achieve length and only digits
padding : would loose vital information
further encryption : couldn't find an algorithm producing such a short (in terms of length) key.

Your only choice is a hash, otherwise you'll need Harry Potter to help you out. Or did you expect that you can transform 4 digits back into any 3 possible Strings? I'm afraid that kind of compression doesn't exist.
As for your ""[B@84abc9"". That's the default toString() for a byte array. You'll want to turn it into hexadecimal or Base64 before displaying it.

","Probably a lookup table of an Array with 255 entries would be fastest ""In Ruby"" solution.

","Have you taken a look at the RubyDES library? That may remove the need to write your own implementation.
To calculate parity, you can use something like the following:
require 'rubygems'
require 'inline'  # RubyInline (install with `gem install RubyInline`)

class Fixnum
  # native ruby version: simpler but slow
  # algorithm from: 
  #   http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#ParityParallel      
  def parity_native
    (((self * 0x0101010101010101) & 0x8040201008040201) % 0x1FF) & 1
  end

  class << self
    # inline c version using RubyInline to create c extension
    # 4-5 times faster than native version
    # use as class method: 
    #   Fixnum.parity(0xAB)
    inline :C do |builder|
      builder.c <<-EOC
      int parity_c(int num) {  
        return (
            ((num * 0x0101010101010101ULL) & 0x8040201008040201ULL) % 0x1FF
          ) & 1;
      }
      EOC
    end
  end

  def parity
    self.class.parity_c(self)
  end

  def parity_odd?
    1 == parity
  end
  def parity_even?
    0 == parity
  end
end

0xAB.parity        # => 1 
0xAB.parity_odd?   # => true 
0xAB.parity_even?  # => false
(0xAB + 1).parity  # => 0

According to simple benchmarks, the inline c version is 3-4 times faster than the native ruby version
require 'benchmark'
n = 10000
Benchmark.bm do |x|
  x.report(""inline c"") do
    n.times do 
      (0..255).map{|num| num.parity}
    end
  end

  x.report(""native ruby"") do
    n.times do 
      (0..255).map{|num| num.parity_native}
    end

","I would construct a single table of 16 entries (as a 16 character table), corresponding to each nibble (half) of a bytes. Entries are 0,1,1,2,1,2,....4
To test your byte,
Mask out the left nibble and do a lookup, memorizing the number.
Do. a shift to the right by 4 and do a second lookup, adding the result number to the previous one to provide a sum.
Then test the low order bit from the sum.  If it is 1, the byte is odd, if it is a 0, the byte is even.  If result is even, you flip the high order bit, using the xor instruction.
THis lookup method is much faster than adding up the bits in a byte by single shifts.
email me for a simple function to do the parity for 8 bytes.  3DES uses 3 groups of 8 bytes.

","DES traditionally accepts a 64 bit key where only 56 bits are used to encrypt the message. You could try setting the KeySize property of the DESCryptoServiceProvider to 128 and see how it goes.
Are you sure the whole key is used? the doco for this states:

ENCRYPT_DES
  Data Encryption Standard. Block cipher. Uses key length of 56 bits.

I would assume that only the first 56 bits of the key are used (the first 7 characters). You could try running the encryption method in oracle with the first 7 characters and see if the output is the same compared to all 16.
If that's the case and you really want/need to to use 128 bit keys, you should move up to triple-DES or AES.

EVP_EncryptUpdate(&ctx, out, &outlen1, in, strlen(text));
No Just wondering why ciphertext returned by ""C"" and ""JAVA"" are different for same text and key, I'm expecting them tobe same
","The reason the C code outputs 32 bytes of ciphertext is because you are padding your input string with zeros before passing it to the encryption function.
In this line:
EVP_EncryptUpdate(&ctx, out, &outlen1, in, sizeof(in));

the function has no idea that you padded your data with zeros. Since sizeof(in) is 16, it takes 16 as the length of your plaintext. And with PKCS5 padding (and AES), 16 bytes will pad to 32  bytes.
In your Java code you didn't manually pad your input, you just passed it straight to the encryption function. So the encryption function sees your plaintext size as 4 bytes, which pads to 16 with PKCS5 padding.
So your solution is simple: don't manually pad your input in the C code. Just pass the plaintext directly to EVP_EncryptUpdate. It's already designed to handle unpadded plaintext.

","DES supports only a key size of 56 bit (64 bit with parity). So you cannot use a larger key with it. Mcrypt knows this and silently only uses the first 8 bytes. Mcrypt also doesn't implement proper padding. Instead it pads with 0x00 bytes. You should be able to use a similar, but not same, padding in BouncyCastle:
Cipher.getInstance(""DES/ECB/ZeroBytePadding"", ""BC"");

Never use ECB mode. It's deterministic and therefore not semantically secure. You should at the very least use a randomized mode like CBC or CTR. It is better to authenticate your ciphertexts so that attacks like a padding oracle attack are not possible. This can be done with authenticated modes like GCM or EAX, or with an encrypt-then-MAC scheme.
NOTE DES should not be used at all for new developments.

","To answer your comment above:
Encrypt:

Get keysize and blocksize
Get IV - this should really be something random and properly generated but to work with DCPcrypt without specifying an IV manually you need to use the one provided.
Hash the key
Add the padding - you've got this bit wrong. For this example you need something like:
$blocksize = mcrypt_get_block_size(MCRYPT_DES, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC);
$padsize = $blocksize - (strlen($str) % $blocksize);
$str .= str_repeat(chr($padsize), $padsize);

Encrypt
Base64 encode

Decrypt:

Get keysize 
Get IV - as above (must be the same as the one used to encrypt but, again, should really be properly cryptographically generated). 
Hash the key
Base64 decode
Decrypt
Remove the padding

Does anyone tell me how to make ldapsearch to resolve given password by clear text and stored password by DES encoding?
I’d like to know is how to make plaintext JacicFk5 from ldapseach command-line to hash IfjFxsltK/MPE and make it match against IfjFxsltK/MPE in DB as userPassowrd.
Is there suitable directive for ldap.conf or slapd.conf?
I've checked followings .

One more info.
my ldapseach can solve password text for users stored in AD server via ownclod.
","What you want/need to have is a LDAP simple authentication.  Please first note that it is unsecure to store passwords in plaintext!
First you need to test what auth mechanisms you have supported/allowed.
An example:
tukanos@localhost:~# ldapsearch -H ldap:// -x -LLL -s base -b """" supportedSASLMechanisms
dn:
supportedSASLMechanisms: DIGEST-MD5
supportedSASLMechanisms: CRAM-MD5
supportedSASLMechanisms: NTLM

Now you want to change the onfiguration via ldapmodify.  You prepare a LDIF file (LDIF stands for LDAP Data Interchangable Format)  with configuration.
Prepare your configuration file you can name it olcSaslSecProps.ldif:
dn: cn=config
replace: olcSaslSecProps
olcSaslSecProps: noanonymous,minssf=0,passcred

What the properties mean: 
noanonymous ... no anonymous connection allowed
minssf=0 ... that defines your effective encryption strength (0 ... no encryption)
passcred ... that would allow password to work as for credentials

To quote the OpenLDAP security considerations

Security Strength Factors
The server uses Security Strength Factors (SSF) to indicate the
  relative strength of protection. A SSF of zero (0) indicates no
  protections are in place. A SSF of one (1) indicates integrity
  protection are in place. A SSF greater than one (>1) roughly
  correlates to the effective encryption key length. For example, DES is
  56, 3DES is 112, and AES 128, 192, or 256.
A number of administrative controls rely on SSFs associated with TLS
  and SASL protection in place on an LDAP session.
security controls disallow operations when appropriate protections are
  not in place. For example:
    security ssf=1 update_ssf=112

requires integrity protection for all operations and encryption
  protection, 3DES equivalent, for update operations (e.g. add, delete,
  modify, etc.). See slapd.conf(5) for details.

Now to apply the LDIF file:
ldapmodify -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:// -f ./olcSaslSecProps.ldif

Now to restart the slapd daemon:
systemctl restart slapd

If you check now your configuration you should get LOGIN and PLAIN:
ldapsearch -H ldap:// -x -LLL -s base -b """" supportedSASLMechanisms
dn:
supportedSASLMechanisms: PLAIN
supportedSASLMechanisms: LOGIN

Now your search should work with plain test password:
ldapsearch -x  -b ""dc=example,dc=com"" -D uid=""HDZZZ0R0N,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"" -w JacicFk5 '(&(uid= HDZZZ0R0N)(objectClass=*))'

E_Kn = Encryption with Key number n.
D_Kn = Decryption with Key number n.

So you can easily ""emulate"" 3DES with just DES.

"10246083","Emulate 3DES EDE using only DES","My device doesn't support full 3DES (EDE). How can I emulate one using standard DES? Encryption mode is CBC.
","You start by picking three independent DES keys which are not related to each other in any way.
You will want to put DES into ECB mode, not CBC mode. You also need to ensure that each encryption and decryption operation is done only on 64-bit blocks and nothing more or less. Padding schemes and the likes will cause a vulnerability in the implementation and will lead to the discovery of the block content via brute force faster than a brute force against each key.
Using the first key, encrypt your plaintext. Using the second key, decrypt that value. Using the third key, encrypt the value for your full block. It looks like this:
Encrypt(k3, Decrypt(k2, Encrypt(k1, plaintext)))
Decryption is the other way around and looks like this:
Decrypt(k1, Encrypt(k2, Decrypt(k3, ciphertext)))
When you encrypt your blocks with 3DES you then need to apply your mode of operation like CBC or CTR and apply padding if needed.

"10246083","Emulate 3DES EDE using only DES","My device doesn't support full 3DES (EDE). How can I emulate one using standard DES? Encryption mode is CBC.
","Block mode encryption
What you do is that you split the key of size 128 bit (16 byte) or 168 bit (24 byte) in two or three pieces respectively. So for a 16 byte key K you would have two keys Ka and Kb, and for a 24 byte key you would have Ka, Kb and Kc. DES ABC keys have an effective strength of about 112 bits, DES ABA keys have an effective strength of about 80 bits.
To encrypt a single block of 8 bytes (the block size of both DES and 3DES) you would perform the following cryptographic operation: Cn = E(Ka, D(Kb, E(Kc, Mn))) where Mn is the n'th block of the plain text message and Cn the n'th block of the cipher text. If you don't have a Kc then you may use Ka (DES ABC key vs DES ABA key).
For this you need a single block DES encrypt, which is identical to a single block encrypt in ECB mode, or a single block encrypt with CBC and an IV consisting of 8 bytes valued 00h.
CBC
So that's the block encryption sorted, now you need some kind of encryption mode and padding mode. I'll explain CBC mode encryption here, ECB should not be used for encryption non-random data.
With CBC mode encryption you XOR a vector to the plain text. The vector is normally just the output of the last DESede encrypted block. As you don't have any preceding cipher text, you need to create the first vector yourself using random data. This vector is called the initialization vector or IV. See wikipedia for a clear picture.
Padding
Block cipher modes only allow full blocks of plain text to be encrypted. So you would need some kind of padding scheme. Although there are many padding modes, PKCS#5 padding is used most of the time. You should pad the plain text like this: pad with bytes valued 0Xh, where X is the number of padding bytes required to create a full block. X should be between 1 and 8: in other words, PKCS#5 padding is always used; this makes it possible to distinquish the padding bytes from the plain text.
If you use padding in an online protocol then you need to protect against padding oracle attacks. In this case it is highly recommended to use some form of integrity checks, e.g. by adding a HMAC over the cipher text using a separate key.

Edit:
Python docs for crypt.crypt 
","I believe there isn't currently any publicly available package for Go which implements the old-fashioned Unix ""salted"" DES based crypt() functionality. This is different from the normal symmetrical DES encryption/decryption which is implemented in the ""crypto/des"" package (as you have discovered).
You would have to implement it on your own. There are plenty of existing implementations in different languages (mostly C), for example in FreeBSD sources or in glibc. If you implement it in Go, please publish it. :)
For new projects it is much better to use some stronger password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt. A good implementation is available in the go.crypto repository. The documentation is available here. Unfortunately this does not help if you need to work with pre-existing legacy password hashes.
Edited to add: I  had a look at Python's crypt.crypt() implementation and found out that it is just a wrapper around the libc implementation. It would be simple to implement the same wrapper for Go. However your idea of comparing a Python implementation to a Go implementation is already ruined: you would have to implement both of them yourself to make any meaningful comparisons.

","crypt is very easy to wrap with cgo, eg
package main

import (
    ""fmt""
    ""unsafe""
)

// #cgo LDFLAGS: -lcrypt
// #define _GNU_SOURCE
// #include <crypt.h>
// #include <stdlib.h>
import ""C""

// crypt wraps C library crypt_r
func crypt(key, salt string) string {
    data := C.struct_crypt_data{}
    ckey := C.CString(key)
    csalt := C.CString(salt)
    out := C.GoString(C.crypt_r(ckey, csalt, &data))
    C.free(unsafe.Pointer(ckey))
    C.free(unsafe.Pointer(csalt))
    return out
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(crypt(""abcdefg"", ""aa""))
}

Which produces this when run
aaTcvO819w3js

Which is identical to python crypt.crypt
>>> from crypt import crypt
>>> crypt(""abcdefg"",""aa"")
'aaTcvO819w3js'
>>>

","The problem is that you are confusing a password or pass phrase and a key; a password is not a key.
It is however possible to derive a password from a key. You should use a Password Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF) to do so. There are a few of them that are safe to use: scrypt, bcrypt and PBKDF2. The latter is also present within the standard Oracle implementation of Java. It is part of the functions to support Password Based Encryption (PBE) in Java, as specified in the PKCS#5 standard.
See for instance the code in this question on how to utilize PBKDF2. Note that you have to create a salt (a secure random value of 64 bits or more) and add store it with your ciphertext.

What is wrong?
","DES supports only a key size of 56 bit (64 bit with parity). So you cannot use a larger key with it. Mcrypt knows this and silently only uses the first 8 bytes. Mcrypt also doesn't implement proper padding. Instead it pads with 0x00 bytes. You should be able to use a similar, but not same, padding in BouncyCastle:
Cipher.getInstance(""DES/ECB/ZeroBytePadding"", ""BC"");


Never use ECB mode. It's deterministic and therefore not semantically secure. You should at the very least use a randomized mode like CBC or CTR. It is better to authenticate your ciphertexts so that attacks like a padding oracle attack are not possible. This can be done with authenticated modes like GCM or EAX, or with an encrypt-then-MAC scheme.

","Triple DES, DES-EDE or TDEA (formally speaking) can be used with no less than 3 key sizes.
The most logical form uses 3 separate keys for each of the phases (Encrypt, Decrypt and then Encrypt again, which is the meaning of EDE). It has a key size of 3 times 56 bits or 168 bits, but those are usually encoded with parity bits (the least significant bit of each byte), making 192 bits in total. Due to a meet-in-the-middle attack (already known at the design phase) the security is only around 112 bits, so don't be fooled by the key size alone.
The two key DES-EDE uses the same keys for the Encrypt phases. The key size is therefore 112 bits, encoded as 128 bits and a security of just around 80 bits, due to various attacks. 80 bits is probably just a bit on the short side nowadays.
Finally single key DES-EDE is mainly used for backwards compatibility. The first encrypt and decrypt cancel each other out so you're left with just one encrypt. You can guess the key sizes; single key TDES is never used in software and may not be supported (it just makes sense in hardware, where you don't want to supply a separate implementation of DES in addition to DES-EDE).

DES-EDE is much slower than a good implementation of AES, and AES has a security of around 126,8 for a key size of 128 bits (using a very complicated attack). So if you have any chance, choose AES instead.

","If you want to understand what is going on, you should read about block cipher operations here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_codebook_.28ECB.29
In a nutshell, block ciphers chaining causes the input of one block operation to be fed into the next block operation. This obscures any block-level patterns in the ciphertext. Since there is a chaining structure, the last block gets an input from the second last block, and so on... until the second block gets an input from the first block. Now the first block needs to get an input from something, but there are no preceding blocks. So we use something called an Initialization Vector (iv) to start it off. This IV does not need to be secret like the key, but it does need to have a low probability of re-use (otherwise the attacker can use it to correlate the first blocks of all your ciphertexts). Typically random numbers are used, or sometimes increasing sequence numbers.
In regard to the specific call:
Your method works to decrypt a single block using DES. (Which is nowadays considered out of date and insecure, by the way, please consider using AES instead - the block cipher structures remain the same so all you need to do is swap the library). Anyway,
Since you're using a cipher in ECB mode, each block is decrypted independently with the same initialization vector, which is provided to your Decrypt method call. The call to CreateDecryptor initializes a decryption object using the provided secret key and initialization vector.
The actual decryption is performed using the call to TransformFinalBlock. The arguments are the input byte array, and then an offset and a length parameter (used for when you don't want to decrypt the entire byte array). In this case you do want to use the entire byte array so the starting offset is 0 and the size is the length of the whole byte array.
One thing you should probably add is to check that the input byte array is the correct block size for your cipher, otherwise it will throw an exception. In the case of DES, this is 64 bits. If you switch to AES as I recommended it will be 128 bits.

        return BitConverter.ToString(KeyGeneratorForm.Encrypt(ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(key), ""abcdefgh"")).Replace(""-"", """");
    }

I'm trying to perform the same thing in PHP:
function get_encrypted_key($key){
    $salt = ""abcdefgh"";
    return bin2hex(mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_DES, $salt, $key, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $salt));
}

However, there is a small discrepency in the results, as the last 16 chars are always different:
With key ""Benjamin Franklin"":
C# : 0B3C6E5DF5D747FB3C50DE952FECE3999768F35B890BC391
PHP: 0B3C6E5DF5D747FB3C50DE952FECE3993A881F9AF348C64D

With key ""President Franklin D Roosevelt"":
C# : C119B50A5A7F8C905A86A43F5694B4D7DD1E8D0577F1CEB32A86FABCEA5711E1
PHP: C119B50A5A7F8C905A86A43F5694B4D7DD1E8D0577F1CEB37ACBE60BB1D21F3F

I've also tried to perform the padding transform to my key using the following code:
function get_encrypted_key($key){
    $salt = ""abcdefgh"";

    $extra = 8 - (strlen($key) % 8);
    if($extra > 0) {
        for($i = 0; $i < $extra; $i++) {
            $key.= ""\0"";
        }
    }

    return bin2hex(mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_DES, $salt, $key, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $salt));
}

But I end up with the same results as without padding.
If you have any clue as to what's going on, I'd be glad to hear about it! :)
Thanks
","You mentioned trying a ""classic"" padding snippet. The following quick adaptation of the snippet posted on the mcrypt_encrypt documentation gives the same results you were getting from C#.
PKCS #7 (the default padding scheme used by C#'s SymmetricAlgorithm) pads with bytes where each padding byte's value is the same as the number of bytes of padding, not with zero bytes.
function get_encrypted_key($key)
{
    $salt = 'abcdefgh';
    $block = mcrypt_get_block_size('des', 'cbc');
    $pad = $block - (strlen($key) % $block);
    $key .= str_repeat(chr($pad), $pad);

    return bin2hex(mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_DES, $salt, $key, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $salt));
}

Test output:
php > echo get_encrypted_key('Benjamin Franklin');
0b3c6e5df5d747fb3c50de952fece3999768f35b890bc391
php > echo get_encrypted_key('President Franklin D Roosevelt');

I'm now trying to do the reverse operation (decrypt) with knowing the _password, _salt and _iterations variables, of course.
print encoder.decrypt(encrypted) doesn't match the initial password.
I don't know what to do next. I read the §6.1.2 of the rfc2898 but it didn't help me. Can anyone guide me to the right answer?
EDIT :
Seems like the following is needed:
encoder2 = DES.new(result[:8], DES.MODE_CBC, result[8:16])
print encoder2.decrypt(encrypted)

Why do I have to use DES.new() again? How can I get rid of the padding?

","Just take the last byte and remove as many characters as it encodes (including the last byte).
Beware that you should add an authentication tag if you are vulnerable to error oracles such as padding oracles.

Length of ""123456"" is 6 and the decrypter outputs 8 bytes. The remaining position is filled with a default byte, so the rstrip strips the bytes and gives the string.

I have to use this but.. I don't know how! I mean, someone gave me this and said ""Please note that ecb_crypt comes from a standard encryption library (e.g. openSSL)."".
Ok, so I've installed openSSL, but I can't find this function. I found something similar, but with different arguments (AES_ecb_encrypt).
So, I try to ask you: do you know where I can find ecb_encrypt with those arguments? Where? Is it in openSSL?
It is used, for example, in this way:
void DesEncrypt3Des(void *pResult, const void *pData, KEY_3DES *pKey)
{
    memcpy(pResult, pData, 8);
    ecb_crypt((char *)&pKey->left, (char *)pResult, 8, DES_ENCRYPT);

    ecb_crypt((char *)&pKey->left, (char *)pResult, 8, DES_ENCRYPT);

Further, I don't have any idea what is DES_ENCRYPT in the parameter. I think it is a constant I have to define, but with which value?

You could note KS 16 happens to reflect PC2.  Which tells us when right shifting C and D for decryption to reverse the selected key order shifts occur after using the round key while during encryption (and as you have shown) the left shifts are applied before using the round key.  If you tabularize the round keys you'd tend to use the encode method and select them backward for decryption.
What distinguishes the keytab program from yours appears to only reside in having PC1 and PC2 permutations bifurcated for the C and D registers separately.

There's also a javascript DES implementation floating around that's been disabled to prevent it from using arbitrary keys in an educational environment.  Capturing the page you can actual undo the disable allowing it to use arbitrary keys.  See http://people.eku.edu/styere/Encrypt/JS-DES.html.  The value here is in showing off internal values for each round.
[A copy of JS-DES.html with writable keys can be found at http://dpades.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/simu_js/JS-DES.html, the project home page (http://code.google.com/p/dpades/) says it's GPLv2.]

","The certificate and private key in your server keystore are only used for authenticating the server.
With SSL/TLS, the encryption keys are shared keys negotiated during the handshake.
You can see which encryption algorithm from the cipher suites that is used, which you can get from the SSLSession once you've established the connection. (You can get the session from the SSLSocket.)

I built a quasi-processor simulator that takes a precedence graph, determines priorities (and ""ready"" instructions), schedules the tasks on available functional units, etc.  Pretty much a very basic simulator.  
But I realized I should have built it on top of a DES engine, as I have no capacity (other than setting a flag and checking every node on every ""clock tick"") for saying things like ""In 10 cycles, do this"" (i.e. raising signals at pre-defined times and handling events that are supposed to happen in the future or when predetermined criteria have been met).  
I could obviously implement this myself; built an ""event"" class, stick them on a queue, and at the end (or beginning) of every cycle, check the queue and see what's on there, but I figure there's no point in reinventing the wheel.
So complex network simulators are obviously WAY overkill.  I don't need fancy modeling, or queuing or anything like that.  All I need is a built in clock, and the ability to set events to happen, raise flags when things happen, etc, as I described above.
Freeware and C++ would be great.
Anyone have any ideas?  (The closest I've come -- thanks to some other somewhat related questions -- is something called SIMLIB.)
Thank you so much!

I could obviously implement this myself; built an ""event"" class, stick them on a queue, and at the end (or beginning) of every cycle, check the queue and see what's on there, but I figure there's no point in reinventing the wheel.
So complex network simulators are obviously WAY overkill.  I don't need fancy modeling, or queuing or anything like that.  All I need is a built in clock, and the ability to set events to happen, raise flags when things happen, etc, as I described above.
Freeware and C++ would be great.
Anyone have any ideas?  (The closest I've come -- thanks to some other somewhat related questions -- is something called SIMLIB.)
Thank you so much!

Can someone help please?
Or tell me of a better way to encrypt an XML file with a password?

","From the docs.

If this cipher requires any algorithm parameters that cannot be
  derived from the given key, the underlying cipher implementation is
  supposed to generate the required parameters itself (using
  provider-specific default or random values) if it is being initialized
  for encryption or key wrapping, and raise an InvalidKeyException if it
  is being initialized for decryption or key unwrapping. The generated
  parameters can be retrieved using getParameters or getIV (if the
  parameter is an IV).

A very simple way of encrypting is taking your hash and XOR it with the bytes in the file in a loop (256 bits at a time). It's kind of a low-level approach but you won't need to debug the API. You should be able to implement this with very minimal code.

","The suggested answer was posted in the comments by DSM (I've been waiting for him to post answer, this can stay for the meantime).

This works for me, but then I'm not on Windows. Could you open the files in binary mode (""rb""/""wb"") instead and see if that helps? – DSM

The problem was that the original implementation of the 3DES encryption was ran on a unix machine. Whereas the results on a windows system differ.
In order to fix the chunks of missing data, DSM suggested to change the file input/output to binary instead of regular reading/writting, which has given the desired output as seen here.
fyi diffnow only stores the results for 1 month.

","It's probably the padding, it is the only thing that is not synchronized between the two methods. Unfortunately, you may have to create your own unpadding form mcrypt, as that library does not perform PKCS#5 padding (same as PKCS#7 padding really). Fortunately that is rather simple: decrypt, then use the value of the last byte to strip of the last  bytes.
Other security related notes:

DES is not safe, use 3DES (or officially TDEA) as a minimum;
ECB mode is not safe, use CBC (which does use an IV);
ECB mode does not use an IV;
for client/server authentication you need to be aware of padding oracle attacks.

Because it is encrypted, I need to use the generateSecretKey() function (as I'm not using the CFMX_COMPAT method). I am nervous of just creating this when a user is registered in the system and using it for all time and so I thought about creating a new one every time the user logs in, but wasn't sure if that is really necessary. I am already calling a method to update the users login timestamp on each login so adding a new secret key isn't bad, but I wanted to make sure that I didn't go overboard, so my question is this:

When generating secret keys for users to encrypt information is it best to create a new one every time they login or just create one on registration and use it for all time?

","Your answer (as the elves said to Frodo) is both yes and no. Or perhaps in the words of Bob Dole when asked if he wore boxers or breifs... ""depends"".  
What you are asking about is tied stringently to the requirements. Ostensibly the second choice - ""generating a new key"" - would be more secure than reusing the same key. In the first case you have one key per user. In the second your key is more ephemeral and disappears after a session. So the real question is, what level of security is enough for your requirements. 
The trade off is that the code is slightly more complicated, the server has to work a bit harder, and you can't persist sessions (because restarting the server is going to kill your keys presumably). It might also make things like audit reporting more difficult since it sounds like you are encrypting some log type or audit trail type information. 
I would add that if you store these keys along with the data you might as well not bother with generating new ones. You've already degraded whatever benefit you might have garnered by putting the key under the welcome mat ;)
Hope this helps... sorry to be vague.

So, as you probably know, you need to calculate the CMAC (and update your init vec) on transmit as well as receive. You need to save the CMAC each time you calculate it as the init vec for the next crypto operation (whether CMAC or encryption etc).
When calculating the CMAC for your example the data to feed into your CMAC algorithm is the INS byte (0x64) and the command data (0x00). Of course this will be padded etc as specified by CMAC. Note, however, that you do not calculate the CMAC across the entire APDU wrapping (i.e. 90 64 00 00 01 00 00) just the INS byte and data payload is used.
On receive you need to take the data (0x00) and the second status byte (also 0x00) and calculate the CMAC over that. It's not important in this example but order is important here. You use the response body (excluding the CMAC) then SW2.
Note that only half of the CMAC is actually sent - CMAC should yield 16 bytes and the card is sending the first 8 bytes.
There were a few other things that held me up including:

I was calculating the session key incorrectly - it is worth double checking this if things are not coming out as you'd expect
I interpreted the documentation to say that the entire APDU structure is used to calculate the CMAC (hard to read them any other way tbh)

I am still working on calculating the response from a Write Data command correctly. The command succeeds but I can't validate the CMAC. I do know that Write Data is not padded with CMAC padding but just zeros - not yet sure what else I've missed.
Finally, here is a real example from communicating with a card from my logs:

Authentication is complete (AES) and the session key is determined to be F92E48F9A6C34722A90EA29CFA0C3D12; init vec is zeros
I'm going to send the Get Key Version command (as in your example) so I calculate CMAC over 6400 and get 1200551CA7E2F49514A1324B7E3428F1 (which is now my init vec for the next calculation)
Send 90640000010000 to the card and receive 00C929939C467434A8 (status is 9100).
Calculate CMAC over 00 00 and get C929939C467434A8A29AB2C40B977B83 (and update init vec for next calculation)
The first half of our CMAC from step #4 matches the 8 byte received from the card in step #3

Check first MSB (7 - bit) of array[0] and then shiffting this to the left. And then XOR if MSB 7 bit was == 1;
Or save first MSB bit of array[0] and after shiffting put this bit at the end of array[15] at the end (LSB bit).
Just proof it's here:
https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN10922.pdf
Try this way:

Zeros <- 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
SessionKey <- 00 01 02 03 E3 27 64 0C 0C 0D 0E 0F 5C 5D B9 D5
Data <- 6F 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

First u have to encrypt 16 bytes (zeros) with SesionKey;
enc_aes_128_ecb(Zeros);

And u get EncryptedData.

EncryptedData <- 3D 08 A2 49 D9 71 58 EA 75 73 18 F2 FA 6A 27 AC

Check bit 7 [MSB - LSB] of EncryptedData[0] == 1? switch i to true;
 bool i = false;
  if (EncryptedData[0] & 0x80){
    i = true;
  }

Then do Shiffting of all EncryptedData to 1 bit <<.
ShiftLeft(EncryptedData,16);

And now, when i == true - XOR the last byte [15] with 0x87
if (i){
    ShiftedEncryptedData[15] ^= 0x87;
  }


7A 11 44 93 B2 E2 B1 D4 EA E6 31 E5 F4 D4 4F 58 

Save it as KEY_1.
Try bit 7 [MSB - LSB] of ShiftedEncryptedData[0] == 1?
 i = false;
  if (ShiftedEncryptedData[0] & 0x80){
    i = true;
  }

Then do Shiffting of all ShiftedEncryptedData to 1 bit <<.
ShiftLeft(ShiftedEncryptedData,16);

And now, when i == true - XOR the last byte [15] with 0x87
if (i){
   ShiftedEncryptedData[15] ^= 0x87;
}


F4 22 89 27 65 C5 63 A9 D5 CC 63 CB E9 A8 9E B0

Save it as KEY_2.
Now we take our Data (6F 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00) 
As Michael say's - pad command with 0x80 0x00...
XOR Data with KEY_2 - if command was padded, or KEY_1 if don't.
If we have more like 16 bytes (32 for example) u have to XOR just last 16 bytes.
Then encrypt it:
enc_aes_128_ecb(Data);

Now u have a CMAC.

","So your problem with encryption and decryption  
So the below code will help you 
Note  Constants.GWT_DES_KEY will be same on server and client 
for example :
private final static byte[] GWT_DES_KEY = new byte[] {
        -110, 121, -65, 22, -60, 61, -22, -60, 21, -122, 41, -89, -89, -68, -8,
        41, -119, -51, -12, -36, 19, -8, -17, 47
    };
on the server:
  TripleDesCipher cipher = new TripleDesCipher();
    cipher.setKey(Constants.GWT_DES_KEY);
    try {
    enc = cipher.encrypt(String.valueOf(value));
    } catch (DataLengthException e1) {
    e1.printStackTrace();
    } catch (IllegalStateException e1) {
    e1.printStackTrace();
    } catch (InvalidCipherTextException e1) {
    e1.printStackTrace();
    }

On the client, make sure you inherit the module:
<inherits name='com.googlecode.gwt.crypto.Crypto'/>
Then:

  TripleDesCipher cipher = new TripleDesCipher();
    cipher.setKey(Constants.GWT_DES_KEY);
    String dec ="""";
    try {
    dec = cipher.decrypt(enc);
    } catch (DataLengthException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (InvalidCipherTextException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
    }

","nodejs calls OpenSSL, whose naming schemes have some odd warts due to hysterical raisins. des-ede-$mode in OpenSSL is actually Keying Option 2, aka 2-key TDEA. For 'real' 3-key TDEA you must ask for des-ede3-$mode in this case des-ede3-cbc. 
Also the Java code uses new byte[8] for the IV value, which is 8 bytes all zero, but your nodejs code uses random bytes. Random is actually better cryptographically, but if your goal is to produce the same results as the Java code you need to replicate its mistake.
Finally the Java code encodes the result in base64 while your nodejs code uses hex. These are semantically equivalent and easily interconvertible, but are not the same. If you do want the same, nodejs does support base64.
Aside: the attempted error check in the Java code 
 if (passwd == null && passwd.equals("""") && msgId == null && msgId.equals(""""))

is just stupid; no Java String can be == null and .equals("""") simultaneously. All those && log-and should be || log-or. This code has clearly not been written or tested or reviewed competently; if I were you (which I'm not) I would avoid having anything to do with it.

","@Keenan ""I was hoping to avoid using sscanf and char* in place of the Cocoa classes"". Well you can do that, but what are you hoping to produce? If you want a byte array as the result then you need to stick to unsigned char[], and that begs the question why you'd do the parsing on NSString in the first place.
Here is an Objective-C translation of your C code. Note that octal is seen as ancient history by Cocoa so its parsing classes only deal with decimal and hexadecimal, so you need to write your own or use a standard C function (strtol below).
This example produces both a unsigned char[] and an NSMutableArray - pick one.
// There are no checks in the code, like in the original...
// BTW 789 is not an octal number...
NSString *descKey = @""123 456 789 101 112 131 415 161"";         //    char *deskey = ""123 456 789 101 112 131 415 161"";
// pick one...
NSMutableArray *keyObjC = [NSMutableArray new];                 //    unsigned char key[16];
unsigned char keyC[16];
//    memset(key, 0, sizeof(key));

// As @JeremyP has pointed out the sscanf is wrong as %o produces a 4-byte value and you only want a 1-byte one.
// In C you would therefore need key to be an array of ints and then assign each element to a byte (unsigned char),
// or parse a different way.

unsigned ix = 0;    // for keyC choice only
NSArray *numbers = [descKey componentsSeparatedByString:@"" ""];  //    sscanf(deskey, ""%o %o %o %o %o %o %o %o"",
for (NSString *aNumber in numbers)                              //           (int*)&key[0], (int*)&key[1], (int*)&key[2],
{                                                               //           (int*)&key[3], (int*)&key[4], (int*)&key[5],
                                                                //           (int*)&key[6], (int*)&key[7]);
    unsigned char next = (unsigned char)strtol([aNumber UTF8String], NULL, 8);
    keyC[ix++] = next;                                          // for keyC choice
    [keyObjC addObject:[NSNumber numberWithUnsignedChar:next]]; // keyObjC choice
}

If you want to approach the one line of your Python just compress the iteration to:
for (NSString *aNumber in [descKey componentsSeparatedByString:@"" ""]) { [keyObjC addObject:[NSNumber numberWithUnsignedChar:(unsigned char)strtol([aNumber UTF8String], NULL, 8)]]; }

but it is still longer of course!

","As CRD has already done a good job of showing you a correct solution, I'll use my answer to explain why your solutions didn't work.

  unsigned char key[16];
  memset(key, 0, sizeof(key));
  sscanf(deskey, ""%o %o %o %o %o %o %o %o"",
    (int*)&key[0], (int*)&key[1], (int*)&key[2],

    (int*)&key[6], (int*)&key[7]);


Lying to the compiler never solves problems.
key is an array of unsigned chars. Telling the compiler, in your function call to sscanf, that your pointers into the array are pointers to ints does not make them so; the storage each one points to is still storage for an unsigned char, and no more.
The result of this is that each attempt to store one int at an address you provided overwrites three-quarters of the previous int. The result of that is that the sscanf amounts to little more than a harder way of doing the same thing as the memset.
I say “little more” and not “no more” for a reason: The sscanf call also writes sizeof(int) - sizeof(unsigned char) bytes beyond the end of the array, so you are also smashing the stack and setting up for a potential crash.

    if ([scanner scanInt:&pos]) {
      [enckey addObject:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%o"", pos]];


scanInt: parses the number from the string in decimal. stringWithFormat: likewise does what its name says: It creates a string. With the format you gave it, it converts a number to a string, not the other way around.
Thus, you use scanInt: to parse the number in decimal, and stringWithFormat: to convert it to octal (and encode it back into a string). Assuming, from the sscanf-based code, that the input was in octal, this is the opposite of what you want.
This code will certainly give you numbers, but it will give you wrong numbers, which is almost as bad as the sscanf code that gave you all zeroes plus a crash.
You cannot use NSScanner to scan octal numbers.
I'm also not sure why you called this variable pos, as it does not appear to be a position. Certainly that's not what scanInt: gives you.

I was able to scan the string and pull out the numbers, but I'm not sure how to store into NSData after that.

See the NSData documentation.

I've tried using NSMutableArray and NSData but having no luck.

That has nothing to do with the problem, which is parsing the input data.
I'm not sure whether an NSArray or a C array (the latter optionally wrapped in an NSData) would be the correct place to put the result. It depends on where you want to pass the numbers once you have them parsed.

When I'm testing it, btw all inputs are in hex, my input is:
02468aceeca86420
Used key is: 
0f1571c947d9e859
the encryption output should be:
da02ce3a89ecac3b
But I'm getting this output instead:
019945B853663D50
I double checked everything and I really don't know what I did wrong here ... Pardon me for the messy code but it was written in less than a day :/ 
Thank you for any tip 
","This is the implementation of the DES algorithm, as specified by the NIST in publication FIPS PUB 197, availible on the NIST website, here. The algorithm takes 64 bit blocks and encrypts them using a 56 bit key, producing a 64 bit output in the classic case with no padding or zero padding. Your implementation should use bitwise operations over 8 byte arrays, not hex string representations of length 16, or char[32] like you do in your permutations. Obviously permutations, shifts or rotations of char arrays of size 16 or 32 are not idempotent with same operations over 64 bit values described in the algorithm and adjustments should be made. Not only this approach is bug prone, but it is also much slower. Answering this would mean debugging and fixing your code which is beyond the purpose of this site imho, and since this looks like a homework to me (prove me wrong) I am going to preach this small DESCryptoServiceProvider wrapper.

Check it like this, with your data:
// the encryption output should be: da02ce3a89ecac3b
// But I'm getting this output instead: 019945B853663D50
string inputString = ""02468aceeca86420"";
string stringkey = ""0f1571c947d9e859"";
string encryptedReference = ""da02ce3a89ecac3b"";
string siv = ""0000000000000000"";
encryptedString = DesCsp.EncryptHexStrings(inputString, stringkey, siv);
decryptedString = DesCsp.DecryptHexStrings(encryptedString, stringkey, siv);
Debug.Assert(inputString.ToUpper() == decryptedString.ToUpper());
Debug.Assert(encryptedString.ToUpper() == encryptedReference.ToUpper());

The symmetric encryption algorithms in System.Security.Cryptography also have an initialization vector, but you needn't worry about that. Just like this wrapper
you could use your EncryptBytes(byte[] input, byte[] desKey) method all over the place. For your public static string EncryptHexStrings(string input, string desKey) you'd adapt the input string to a byte array, encrypt it as bytes, make a hex string out of the encrypted bytes on return.

When I'm testing it, btw all inputs are in hex, my input is:
02468aceeca86420
Used key is: 
0f1571c947d9e859
the encryption output should be:
da02ce3a89ecac3b
But I'm getting this output instead:
019945B853663D50
I double checked everything and I really don't know what I did wrong here ... Pardon me for the messy code but it was written in less than a day :/ 
Thank you for any tip 
","The encrypt test vector (0F1571C947D9E859 02468ACEECA86420 DA02CE3A89ECAC3B) is valid, I checked against standard compliant implementation.
The way to trouble shoot a new DES implementation is to compare round values against a known implementation, such as using a DES Calculator that produces round values. You could likewise copy a known good implementation and modify it to output round values. It also means producing the same values for your implementation each round.  
The failure will show up in your implementation of one or more of the permutations, the  key schedule or it's shift direction, or programming language syntax or semantics.
It's easier to compare binary results when you're dealing with strings of 1's and 0's.
There's also a javascript implementation of DES found on google code:
JS-DES.html, and if you want the missing images from the bottom of the page they can be found at JS-DES_fichiers.  Save the images in a sub directory named JS-DES_fichiers.
This is what it produces for

When I'm testing it, btw all inputs are in hex, my input is:

I double checked everything and I really don't know what I did wrong here ... Pardon me for the messy code but it was written in less than a day :/ 
Thank you for any tip 
","This is almost complete code for beginner like me to start learning to use DES. How about making some corrections so everyone don't need to follow the same debugging and fixing job (or better if they do this). Some of helping links are gone but something useful is out there. I was using
http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~kant/teaching/hess/krypto-ws2006/des.htm
and
http://people.eku.edu/styere/Encrypt/JS-DES.html (with modified not readonly)

first key must be the last keys[15] and every next is keys[i-1]
strtoBin is very wrong there. After discarding it there is better output directly binarray from SBoxSubstitution by forming output res like res += Convert.ToString(s1, 2).PadLeft(4, '0'); in first if (i == 1) and so on
last number in expanstionArr must be 0 of course

After those 3 modifications I got the DESEncryption working.
And what you know... decrypting is working too without any other repair :) For that you copy whole DESEncryption to ""DESDecryption"" and change only (int j = 0; j < 16; j++) to for (int j = 15; j >= 0; j--)

PKCS7 and PKCS5 are compatible each other

PKCS#5 and PKCS#7 paddings are compatible (equal) for DES. For AES, Java actually uses PKCS#7 padding even though you would write AES/xyz/PKCS5Padding.

Why I get same result even though the mode, way are all different?

First, let's see how Java behaves. The ciphertexts for DES-ECB, DES-CBC and DESede-ECB are all equal. This is correct if 

the key is the same (DES supports only 8 byte keys, but Triple DES supports 8, 16 and 24 byte keys where non-24 byte keys are expanded to 24 byte keys), 
the plaintext is the same,
the plaintext is less than 8 bytes long (block size of DES/Triple DES) and
the IV is an all 0x00 bytes IV.

Those are all true in the Java code. If you have trouble grasping that, combine the encryption routines for the ECB and CBC modes of operation. 
The result of Triple DES might be a bit confusing. I assume that you've taken your 8 byte key for DES and replicated it either twice or thrice for use in Triple DES. This is an issue, because Triple DES encryption consists of three steps of normal DES: EDE means Encryption + Decryption + Encryption. If all the three subkeys are the same, the one of the Encryption steps cancels out with the Decryption step and the whole thing is equivalent to a single DES encryption.
Let's see why C# behaves differently:
The ciphertext from DES-CBC is different from DES-ECB, because the IV is not an all 0x00 bytes IV. cryptoProvider.CreateEncryptor(key, key) creates an Encryptor with the IV set to key (the second argument). That's not what you want. Just use cryptoProvider.CreateEncryptor() instead.
The ciphertext from DESede-ECB is different from DES-ECB, because you're running the key through a hash function. The key is therefore different.

Don't use DES nowadays. It only provides 56 bit of security. AES would be a much better, because it's more secure with the lowest key size of 128 bit. There is also a practical limit on the maximum ciphertext size with DES. See Security comparison of 3DES and AES.

","OpenSSL's standard way to save keys is to use PEM format (PEM header and footer and base64-encoded DER key inside). Private key is additionally encrypted (encryption algorithm is specified in header). JKS doesn't use DER for encryption of the private key, so you can't just take the encrypted DER sequence and put it to JKS. To add the keypair to JKS you need to get both public and private key in DER format and the private key must be decrypted.

Is it possible with out giving the encryption key we can get the actual data?

I suspect that if you could, that would defeat the purpose of encryption.  To put that a different way.  If you can find a way to do it, you'd have determined the encryption algorithm was easily crackable, and therefore useless.

DES has a 8-byte 56-bit key (the LSB is not used as part of the key, it is for parity) so you can't use a 16-byte key (parity is generally ignored).
Don't use DES, it is not secure and has been replaced with AES.
Don't use ECB mode, it is insecure, see ECB mode, scroll down to the Penguin.

AES allows 128, 192 and 256 bit keys.

doesn't do what you think.  On a 32 bit system, sizeof(clear) will be 4 because it is the size of the pointer, not the length of the data pointed to.  So you are probably only encrypting/decrypting 4 bytes and you are printing out those 4 bytes plus some garbage.

first create the zip, then encrypt the zip
first encrypt the file, then zip it

>>> s1 = b'abc'

>>> ''.join(chr(ord(i)^ord(j)) for i,j in zip(s1,s2))
'\x04\x04\x04'

the ord() function retuen value of the byte when the argument is an 8-bit string.But if you are using python 3 you dont need ord :
>>> ''.join(chr(i^j) for i,j in zip(s1,s2))
'\x04\x04\x04'


Since bytes objects are sequences of integers (akin to a tuple), for a bytes object b, b[0] will be an integer, while b[0:1] will be a bytes object of length 1. (This contrasts with text strings, where both indexing and slicing will produce a string of length 1)

example :

>>> s1[0]
97

and if you want to convert back your strings you need to firs convert the XORed string to binary you can do it by binascii.a2b_qp function :
>>> import binascii 
>>> s=''.join(chr(i^j) for i,j in zip(s1,s2))
>>> s4=binascii.a2b_qp(s)
>>> ''.join(chr(i^j) for i,j in zip(s1,s4))

Example: 
s1 = b'abc'
s2 = b'efg'

s3 = XOR(s1,s2) // my own method

How can I XOR them or how can I get the binary values of 1s and 0s that represent them?
If you use any python methods explain them, I'm relatively new to this language.
","Not really efficient, but this should work.
s1 = b'abc'

Why decryption returns a right result only in part?
","So it seems like there's no NoPadding options available, in the end I just removed '+ kCCBlockSizeDES' from 'cryptData' initialization and added '0' characters to my string before encrypting it to reach a right size (for example a length multiple of 8) and then after decryption I just removed the zeros to get the original string.

","On Java you use DES in ECB mode and on OpenSSL you use DES in CBC mode (IV is present).
This is a significant difference as in CBC the blocks are chained - therefore the first block is decrypted correctly but all following blocks are scrambled.
You can change the Java part to use ""DES/CBC"" mode instead and provide an IV or change the openssl part and use -des-ecb instead of -des.

","Your DES key should be 8 bytes (56 bits + 8 parity bits).
The string you're using as a key looks like a hexadecimal representation of 7 bytes, but instead of decoding it as hex, you're getting the bytes for the characters in the hex string.
Since there are 14 characters, you will most likely (depending on your encoding) end up with 14 bytes, which is too long for DES.
There are a couple of approaches described in this question that explain how to convert the hex string to a byte array.
That will however only get you so far, because you're still one byte short. A traditional approach seems to be to take the 56 bits you have and spread them out over 8 bytes, adding one parity bit to each byte. A Java example of how to do that is described in this answer. Another approach could be to just add a null byte at the end of the key. Which approach you should take depends on the key's intended usage, especially the way it is used by the other parties you're exchanging information with.

","There is a Java-class called SealedObject (doc) which exactly does what you want to achieve.

This class enables a programmer to create an object and protect its confidentiality with a cryptographic algorithm. 

There is only one restriction for the Object to encrypt, it must be Serializable.
MyObject myObj = new MyObject(); // must be serializable

Cipher cipher;
/* initialize fully with IV, key and Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE */

/* encrypt `myObj` */
SealedObject sealedObj = new SealedObject(myObj, cipher);

/* decrypt `sealedObj` */
MyObjct decryptedObj = (MyObject) sealedObj.get(key); // `key` = encryption-key

Basically this class does the serialization with ObjectOutputStream and ByteArrayOutputStream for you and automatically tracks the algorithm used for encryption.

"43504123","Recursively iterating over every character combination","Expected result:
The program takes a hashed password as input; this is passed to the decrypt function.
The function iterates over every mixed-case n-letter combination, hashing each such string.
If it finds a match to the input, it prints out the un-hashed password ; otherwise, it exits.
Actual result:
Function iterates over every mixed-case letter only for last letter in current iteration.
Description of the problem: 
I'm trying to implement a simple brute-force DES-crypted password-cracker in Python. I did an implementation for 4-character passwords using a lot of for loops, but now I want to refactor it for a range of lengths, using recursion.
How can I iterate over every character combination, starting from 1-char combination up to 4-character string combination?
I wanted to use this line:
            password[i] = string.ascii_letters[j]

But I get this error:
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

Code snippet:
def decrypt(encryptedText):
    # reference global variable
    global password
    # check curr password guess length
    pwdlen = len(password)

    if pwdlen >= 4:
        print(""Password is longer than 4 characters, exiting..."")
        exit(2)

    # debug lines
    print(""password is {}"".format(password))
    print(""length: {}"".format(pwdlen))
    time.sleep(2)

    # first two characters is salt
    salt = encryptedText[:2]

    # Check hashes for every combination of strings and compare them
    # starts with last char
    for i in range(pwdlen, 0, -1):
        for j in range(0, len(string.ascii_letters)):
            password = string.ascii_letters[:pwdlen] + string.ascii_letters[j]
            hashed = crypt.crypt(password, salt)

            # debug line
            print(password)

            # if found - print password and exit
            if hashed == encryptedText:
                print(password)
                exit(0)

    # this makes recursion go through +1 char combinations on every iteration
    password = (pwdlen + 1) * 'a'

    return decrypt(encryptedText)

","Strings are immutable.  You can't assign a new value to part of the string.  Instead, you have to build a new value and assign that to the original variable.  For instance:
# password[i] = string.ascii_letters[j]
password = password[:i] + string.ascii_letters[j] + password[i+1:]

Second, you can probably do much better by using the itertools package to generate all of the permutations you want.  For instance, generate the product of asci_letters as many times as you want, and step through the join of those letter sequences.

"22287627","Why does PHP crypt function use DES encryption algorithm?","Given that the rule of thumb is to store salted hashes of the password string, not the encrypted form of it, why does the PHP crypt() function use the DES-based algorithms? Isn't DES an encryption algorithm? The manual says 

... crypt() will return a hashed string using the standard Unix DES-based algorithm or alternative algorithms that may be available on the system ...

What I understand from here is that crypt() only uses the algorithm as implemented by the system. And surely DES is implemented as an encryption algorithm rather than a custom hashing algorithm for crypt. 
PS - I know that DES was way back in the past and nobody should use it anymore. 
","The idea of DES-based password hashing is, basically, to encrypt a block of zeroes with the password and passed salt for some number of rounds. Any half-decent encryption makes key recovery hard even in the face of known plaintext, so that’s why it’s possible to make strong password hashes out of encryption functions.
I think the PHP default is compatible with this scheme.

","Be careful when converting Strings to bytes that you always use the same encoding.  This line

Note that a ""padding error"" is usually no such thing; it's a very misleading error message.

Is it possible for the DUKPT algorithm to generate weak keys, or does it avoid them? What can I do if it does generate a weak key?
","Possible, but very unlikely. The DUKPT algorithm gives a unique key for every transaction, and all bits at any time can be set or not, therefore it is possible for it to generate a ""weak"" key of all 0s. Depending on the size of your key it becomes much less likely to happen of course, and you want to be careful about arbitrarily throwing out ""weak"" keys, as that weakens the other keys as well.
An all zero key happens 1 time out of 2^(N) where N is the number of bits in your key, so for your 64 bit key: 1/(2^64)...needless to say, not very often. Since the DUKPT generates a unique key per transaction, you should be fine using it without checking for that case in DES since you'll presumably be doing all 16 rounds anyways.

","In Universal Windows apps, you have to use the CryptographicEngine for encrypt and decrypt operations.
For your decryption use-case, you'd use the DecryptAsync method, which requires - beside the encrypted data and the IV - a key to perform the operation.
The key you require will be created by the SymmetricKeyAlgorithmProvider class. Therefore, initialize a new instance by opening the desired algorithm and create the key.
For example:
// Static method call, ""SymmetricAlgorithmNames"" has several DES algorithms,
// so choose the correct one

As you can see in the output, the Encrypt() subroutine works just fine but it all goes wrong with the decryption part. The decryption is supposed to return my original data but it seems like there's nothing happening in the Decrypt() subroutine of the program.
","The ICryptoTransform provides a separate function: TransformFinalBlock that should be used when encrypting/decrypting the buffer that contains the last block of data, and ensures that necessary padding is added. Since you are only working with a single block, you should be using this method rather than TransformBlock. Note that returns the encrypted/decrypted data, rather than placing it in a buffer you pass as a parameter.
No answer regarding DES would be complete without mentioning that DES it's insecure, and more generally, that you should be using a unique, random IV each time the data is encrypted, but I'll assume this is mainly for practice, rather than intended for use protecting anything actually sensitive.

Why is it that the encoded output is of longer byte length than the original input?
Thanks.
","The encrypted message is longer because it includes the IV. BTW, a fixed IV does not make sense, it should be random and newly generated for each message.

","Working backward from the second block (a7691f3f7fb52416) gives 8a285d3601f9bb13, and XORed with the first block (8220553e09f1b31b) gives 0808080808080808 (HEX).  Something is producing the block value of 0808080808080808 as a second input block value.

So all you have to do is figure out where the backspace characters came from as a second block input.

I made the mistake poking around because I know a fair bit about DES, not so much perl.
Adding the padding null seemed to do the trick, after I learned how to add Crypt::CBC and Crypt::DES to a perl library.
I used http://code.google.com/p/dpades/source/browse/trunk/simu_js/JS-DES.html to do the encryptions and decryptions necessary to figure out what's going on.  Use the view raw file button and save JS-DES.html locally, open it with a browser.

One of the problems set asks you to implement an algorithm to crack a password that was hashed using des-based encryption and is up to 4 characters. 
So far, so good. I've done it.
But I decided to improve it a little bit and make it possible to crack passwords that are up to 8 characters, which is the maximum for des-based encryption.
And the problem is, when I add the possibility of the fifth character (or more), my code doesn't work anymore.

I'm using the hash below in both codes but it doesn't work on the second code.
hash - 50fkUxYHbnXGw
text - rofl  

Can someone please help me understand why is it not working?
Thanks.
Edit:
The second code just finished running and it actually is working but it's taking way longer to crack the password. Here's a screenshot:

","In the first case, for 4 characters, you have 4 nested loops. Which ""for"" will execute up to 64 times. So your code may run 64 ^ 4 = 16 million times.
In the second case, for 8 characters, you have 8 nested loops. That makes 64 ^ 8 = 281 trillion times.
The time your computer takes to execute the algoritm is proportional to that amount of loops.
It grows so fast because your algorithm is exponential on the number of characters. If you want to learn more, search for ""algorithm asymptotic notation"".

One of the problems set asks you to implement an algorithm to crack a password that was hashed using des-based encryption and is up to 4 characters. 
So far, so good. I've done it.
But I decided to improve it a little bit and make it possible to crack passwords that are up to 8 characters, which is the maximum for des-based encryption.
And the problem is, when I add the possibility of the fifth character (or more), my code doesn't work anymore.

Edit 3: re-fixing title
","You can think of a - h as wheels of comprised of 65 characters, with indexes 0 through 64. The last character is a line terminator from the declared value.
If you were to add a printf for the value of e:
crack08 50fkUxYHbnXGw
e 1
d 0
d 1
d 2
d 3
d 4
d 5
d 6
d 7
d 8
d 9
d 10
d 11
d 12
d 13
d 14
d 15
d 16
d 17
d 18
d 19
d 20
d 21
d 22
d 23
...
d 63
d 64
e 2
d 0
d 1
d 2
...

You'd see we'd skip over the first value of e because h - f are 0.
Finding a 4 character match is then deferred until e = 64 (the 65th index the '\0' string terminator).
That represents more than 65 times longer before finding a 4 character password.
Getting rid of the extra passes involves reorganizing the 'wheel' of characters used, adding a '\0' character as the first character, using that as string terminator for the first pass and skipping over it for subsequent passes:

(Of course, provided that no other key, in addition to these n group keys to decrypt the file could not be?)
","There isn't a way to encrypt with only one key, and be able to decrypt with several other keys individually.
You could have a group key that is encrypted by several keys, so those keys can decrypt the group key as needed, and the group key can be used to encrypt/decrypt data that is shared between users with different keys.
You could do the same thing with the data itself, but this means all keys need to be available for encryption, which doesn't seem to meet your use case.

","DES uses a short 56 bit key, which was vulnerable to brute force attacks. 3DES uses 168 bit keys (56x3), and performs the encryption like so:

Encrypt clear text using the 1st 56 bits of the key, produce output1
Decrypt output1 using the 2nd 56 bits of the key, produce output2
Encrypt output2 using the 3rd 56 bits of they, produce encrypted text.

That's likely converting the incoming 16 byte key into a format createencryptor isn't expecting.
createencryptor expects to see a key the same size as the BLOCKSIZE, which, according to the docs, is 64 BITS, or 8 bytes.
You're passing in a key of 16 bytes, because of this loop

""The ComputeHash methods of the MD5  class return the hash as an array of 16 bytes. Note that some MD5 implementations produce a 32-character, hexadecimal-formatted hash. To interoperate with such implementations, format the return value of the ComputeHash methods as a hexadecimal value.""

","DES is, in fact, weak encryption. It was publicly broken in the 90's in under 24 hours - the problem is that its key is too short, it's possible to crack it with a brute-force attack. It's no longer suitable as a defense against motivated attackers. There are a number of better options available, such as 3DES, AES, and Twofish.
Edit: 3DES is better than DES in the sense that it's significantly more secure (but still less secure than AES), but its performance is of necessity significantly worse than AES, DES, or Twofish (because you're essentially applying DES three times). 3DES is rarely used for new implementations.

","DES is deprecated in almost all legitimate uses of symmetric encryption (it is obsolete and easily brute-forceable). AES (Rijndael with block size of 128 bits) is the standard symmetric encryption solution, while Blowfish, Twofish, RC4 (also not suggested), and 3DES/TDES are other options. AES is universally supported and will be your best solution in this case. Android has support for AES encryption through native Java JCA (formerly JCE) libraries as well as SpongyCastle -- a modified version of BouncyCastle designed for Android).

You should use a strong (128 or 256 bit) key generated from a CSPRNG (or securely derived from a strong passphrase via PBKDF2, bcrypt, or scrypt with high work factor/iterations), a unique and non-predictable IV for each encryption operation, and (preferably) an authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) cipher block mode of operation like GCM or EAX, or failing that, a HMAC-based message authentication code (MAC) over the cipher text and verify it with a constant-time equality check before performing any decryption.

","Don't ever use DES. It's positively antique (over 40 years old) and the short key length (56 bits) means it can nowadays be cracked quite quickly with modest hardware.
Its weakness was recognized some time ago, which is why Triple DES (3DES) was introduced to offer better security (increasing the key length to 112 bits). However, this came at the expense of increased computation times, since the algorithm has to do considerably more work to encrypt each block of data.
AES beats 3DES in every respect. By design, it is able to operate at high speed with low memory requirements. Furthermore, the latest processors (including Intel x86 and ARM architectures) have built-in AES instructions that allow encryption and decryption to be performed in hardware, resulting in speeds that are orders of magnitude higher than would be possible with 3DES.

","I have to agree with the other answers as regards DES - it provides little defense against a motivated attacker.
In terms of RSA (the other algorithm you mention in your title), public-key encryption algorithms are generally considerably slower (by a magnitude of about 1000 based on what I've read, although I've never personally timed it).
It's also arguably less secure to use public-key cryptography for exchanging long messages.
As some background, public-key cryptography generally depends on some kind of a trap-door function (i.e. a function that is relatively easy to compute but is difficult to find the inverse for). It turns out that those functions are remarkably difficult to find; one of the most common ones now (which is what RSA is based on) is integer factorization, which is NP-Intermediate on ""standard"" computers (but is broken for quantum computers).
First, the fact that integer factorization is NP-intermediate is at least a theoretical weakness in RSA - technically, no one's actually proven that NP-intermediate problems are intrinsically more ""difficult"" than polynomial-time algorithms (although it's widely believed that they are) because that would entail solving the P vs. NP problem, which is one of the major outstanding questions in computer science.
It turns out that many of the trap-door functions aren't quite as difficult to find inverses for as it is to break a good symmetric-key algorithm like AES or Twofish - i.e. the best public cryptanalysis for public-key encryption algorithms tend to be at least somewhat more feasible than the ones for symmetric-key algorithms. (There's a good article here on why it's completely infeasible to ""break"" AES with brute force, and the known attacks against it aren't even close to feasible either).
For this reason, public-key cryptography's often used for things like key exchange, at which point both parties switch to symmetric-key cryptography.
All that to say that the other people are right - use AES :).

Update:

There was an ""original key"" encrypted by RSA
The ""original key"" was decrypted using RSA to give us this (i.e 745347651281) 
This (i.e 745347651281) is now supposed to be used to decryped a DES
file.

Note : The ""original key"" was in hex format which I converted to integer(base 16) before doing RSA decryption.
","The key you have displayed is 48 bits in size, not 96 bits in size - if it is considered to be specified hexadecimals. A DES key without parity would be 56 bits in size. This means that you have to create the parity bits that are missing. The parity of DES is described as such:

One bit in each 8-bit byte of the KEY may be utilized for error detection in key generation, distribution, and storage. Bits 8, 16,..., 64 are for use in ensuring that each byte is of odd parity.

Note that the bits are numbered starting at the left with value 1, meaning that the least significant bit of each byte is used for parity. So you have to distribute the bits you have been given over the bytes, and then adjust the parity of each byte by possibly flipping the least significant bit (using XOR with 1).
Usually libraries have support for this kind of operation. In Java you can do this by generating the DES key using SecretKeyFactory for instance.

","First of all you should write the encrypt and the decrypt method:
public static string Encrypt(string originalString, byte[] key)
{
    DESCryptoServiceProvider cryptoServiceProvider = new DESCryptoServiceProvider();
    MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
    CryptoStream cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(memoryStream,
        cryptoServiceProvider.CreateEncryptor(key, key),
        CryptoStreamMode.Write);

    using (StreamWriter streamWriter = new StreamWriter(cryptoStream))
    {
        streamWriter.Write(originalString);
        streamWriter.Flush();
        cryptoStream.FlushFinalBlock();
        streamWriter.Flush();

        return Convert.ToBase64String(memoryStream.GetBuffer(), 0, (int)memoryStream.Length);
    }
}

public static string Decrypt(string cryptedString, byte[] key)
{
    DESCryptoServiceProvider cryptoServiceProvider = new DESCryptoServiceProvider();
    MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream(Convert.FromBase64String(cryptedString));
    CryptoStream cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(memoryStream,
        cryptoServiceProvider.CreateDecryptor(key, key),
        CryptoStreamMode.Read);

    using (StreamReader streamReader = new StreamReader(cryptoStream))
    {
        return streamReader.ReadToEnd();
    }
}

Now you can apply twice the encryption method (and of course twice the decryption one) to your string:
byte[] key1 = ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(""12345678"");
byte[] key2 = ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(""abcdefgh"");

string originalString = ""A secret string"";
string cryptedString = Encrypt(Encrypt(originalString, key1), key2);
Console.WriteLine(""Encrypt message: {0}"", cryptedString);
Console.WriteLine(""Decrypt message: {0}"", Decrypt(Decrypt(cryptedString, key2), key1));

Take a look to my code, it may help you.

","A 15 character string will be at least 15 bytes. It could become 20 or even 30 if you have a lot of non-ASCII characters.
The Encryption will round it up to a multiple of the key block size, lets say 64 bytes.
Then Base64 goes to encode 8 bit bytes into  6 bit tokens, so you get (64 *  8) / 6 tokens (chars).

","Yes. You can calculate that.
a) DES encryption uses blocks. As I remember it's 8 bytes. So, if you encrypt anything, it will become rounded to the block sizes. 

As example, you encrypt 1 byte, it will be come 8 bytes.
You encrypt 8 bytes, it will become 8 bytes
You encrypt 9 bytes, it will become 16 bytes (minimum amount of block to fit original data)

So, the formale encryptedLength = ceiling (originalLength /8) * 8
b) Base64 has also something very similar to block size. And it's block size is 4. Each original 3 bytes will be converted to 4 bytes block
So, for Base64  encodedLength = ceiling (originalLength/3)*4
So, the final formula is
encodedEncryptedLength = ceiling(ceiling(originalLength/8)*8/3)*4
originalLength here is number of bytes (!!! not characters !!!) in the text which you plan to encrypt.

","It might not be a very technical explanation, but I guess a very good way to understand that is thinking about passwords.
Imagine that an attacker could download your whole database of logins and could retrieve everyone's passwords along with their e-mail accounts. But before that, he decides to create some accounts (with some passwords he knows).
If the encryption used just a key, maybe someone could try to 'decode' your key just by having some sample pairs of unencrypted passwords and encrypted ones (using the accounts he created before) and then use the key + the algorithm to decipher every password in the whole database. A worse scenario would be several users with the same password having the same resulted encryption - the attacker wouldn't need even to decipher the key to use other accounts. He would only have to be a good ""known passwords"" guesser.
Now let's suppose you could introduce some 'ramdom' code at the begging of your encryption/decryption. I.E.: when a user chooses password '12345' instead of encrypting this, you encrypt his e-mail also concatenated 'test@gmail.test12345' and then encrypt. Since there's no way to have two different login e-mails, even if a lot of users choose to use the same password, the resulted encryption would be different. Plus, an attacker would never know what kind of pseudorandom information you have input. This is called 'Salting'.
Salting is not very different than initialization vector, but uses different conventions - this one is array of bytes, but it would mean a string. Some engineers even generate random strings as salt and stores it along the encrypted password. As unrepeatable the the salt is, as difficult to decrypt.

If length of input data is not multiple of 8, its padded with trailing zeros to make it multiple of 8, and then encrypted
eg
If length of your input data is 10, length of output data will be 16

"43829039","Triple DES implementation by DES","I'm trying to implement 3Des by using a DES API as below:
des(input, output, key, mode)

which input, output and key are 8 bytes each one and mode identifies encryption and decryption type.
I'm wondering if it's possible to have a 3Des algorithm with variable output length?
This is the code I've written in C to create 3des with more than 8 bytes key by using this API.
But I have no idea if it's working OK or if it's possible to change output bytes.
unsigned char TripleDes(uchar *input, uchar *output,uchar *deskey, int mode)
{
    uchar tt[100];
    uchar tmpInput[100];
    uchar tmpOutput[100];
    int i=0, j=0;

    memset(tt, 0, sizeof(tt));
    memset(tmpInput, 0, sizeof(tmpInput));
    memset(tmpOutput, 0, sizeof(tmpOutput));

    j =  strlen(input);
    memcpy(tmpInput, input, j);
    while(j/8!=0){
        j-=8;
        if (mode) { //Encrypt
            des(tmpInput+i*8, tmpOutput+i*8, deskey,1);
            des(tmpOutput+i*8, tt, deskey+8, 0);
            des(tt,tmpOutput+i*8, deskey, 1);

I am now trying to make a multithreaded version of this program (my first time playing with threads, so I'm hoping that I'm doing something wrong here).
I first attempted to use crypt directly, this was fast but resulted in mangled hashes, as the threads were contesting the crypt function.
Using mutex lock and unlock on the function helped, but this reduced the speed of the program to just a few percent higher than the single threaded version.
I then managed to google up crypt_r which was advertised to be threadsafe.
Modified both the singlethreaded version to use crypt_r (with single thread)
and the multithreaded version to use it instead of crypt, and the performance in singlethreaded version dropped to around 3.6k h/s and to around 7.7k h/s in the multithreaded version when using two cores at 99.9% utilization.
So the question is, should it be this slow?
","The problem was, that the function I was calling when executing the crypt_r function also contained the code for initializing the struct that it requires.
The solution was to move the initialization out of the function that is called when hashing is done.
simplified example incorrect way:
for (int i = 0; i < 200000; i++)
{
    struct crypt_data data;
    data.initialized = 0;

    char* hash = crypt_r(""password"", ""sa"", &data);
    printf(""%i %s"", i, hash);
}

correct way:
struct crypt_data data;
data.initialized = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < 200000; i++)
{
    char* hash = crypt_r(""password"", ""sa"", &data);

Then call it like this in Main:

When a user inputs a random number of string length (whether greater than or less than 8 characters), a cryptographic exception always happens in this line:
System.Security.Cryptography.ICryptoTransform transform = provider.CreateEncryptor(keyBytes, keyBytes);

It says Specified key is not a valid size for this algorithm.
Removing parts of the key to fit in the length of 8 characters (with or without hashing) doesn't seems to be a secure solution (there might be a high rate of collision).
How can I implement DES (not 3DES) with a user input string?
","You need to generate a hash from the user's password and take only 8 bytes to use as your key.
var fullHash = hashMD5Provider.ComputeHash(System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(key));
var keyBytes = new byte[8];
Array.Copy(fullHash , keyBytes, 8);

Your question expressed concern about hash collisions from throwing away part of the hash; yes, that certainly does increase the risk, but (assuming your hash algorithm is good) you're no worse off than if you just used a hash algorithm that only produced 8 bytes to begin with.  A good hash algorithm should distribute the entropy evenly.

","The IV must be the same for both encryption  and decryption. in the example a new random IV is being created for decryption: secureRandom.nextBytes(ivspec);.
You need to carefully and fully review the CryptoJS documentation to determine how the IV is being handled. Often the IV is prepended to the encrypted data for use during decryption.
The encryptedString seems to be Base64 encoded and the decoded length is 32-bytes, just right for a 16-byte IV and 16-byte encrypted data+padding.

"29984798","EXC_BAD_ACCESS Code 2 on CCCrypt","I am trying to use DES encryption to encrypt passwords (Don't ask why DES, I know it's less secure). I am doing it for the first time in iOS, thus had to rely on another post about how to do it. 
When I run the encryption it returns null, same with decrypting an already encrypted string(I used an online tool to encrypt). When I put a breakpoint to see what is going on, it stopped at CCCrypt mentioning EXC_BAD_ACCESS (Code 2).
I tried using different CCOptions, but it returns the same thing always. 
Any hint what's going wrong? Is iv string required?

","There seems to be general confusion about the algorithm, DES or 3DES, a mix is being used but the key is 3DES (24-bytes). The key needs to be changed to 8-bytes. The block size constant should also be changed to kCCBlockSizeDES but that does not cause an error since it is the same value.
For the method:
- (NSString *) decryptDES: (NSString *) key

The bad access error is caused because no storage is allocated for movedBytes, just a pointer. Change the declaration to:
size_t movedBytes;

Change the reference to movedBytes in CCCrypt to &movedBytes.
Test output for encryption:  

string: ""Your Name""
  key: ""12345678""  
movedBytes: 16
  myData: 136142f6 6cd98e01 af1eef46 28d36499
  result: E2FC9mzZjgGvHu9GKNNkmQ==  

Notes from comments by request:  
ECB mode does not use an iv. 
The key needs to be exactly 8-bytes for DES, if it is to short the result will be undefined. In the updated code the key is 5-bytes but the length is given as 8-bytes (kCCKeySizeDES) so the three missing key bytes will be whatever bytes follow keyData.   
The updated answer did not specify ECB mode, the default is CBC mode. Add kCCOptionECBMode.   
In decrypt do not use Base64 encode, convert the data to a NSString:
NSString * resultStr = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:output encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];  

If using an online encryption that uses the php mcrypt function the last block of the data will be incorrect because mcrypt does not support PKCS#7 padding, it uses non-standard and insecure null padding.

","None of your data appears to be Base-64 encoded, so that's not the function you want to use.  It seems you already have a KeyHexAscii function, you'll want to use whatever function you've written that reverses that.

I need it for keys  analysis in DES and 8 byte key requirement for associated library is creating problem in getting actual keys analysis.
","As explained in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard, the 8-byte key for DES is just a 56-bit key in 8 bytes with odd parity check added:
The key is nominally stored or transmitted as 8 bytes, each with odd parity. According to ANSI X3.92-1981, section 3.5:
One bit in each 8-bit byte of the KEY may be utilized for error detection in key generation, distribution, and storage. Bits 8, 16,..., 64 are for use in ensuring that each byte is of odd parity.

(end quote)
So given an 8-byte key I can generate a 7-byte key by dropping the parity check bits and reformatting, and given a 7-byte key I can generate an 8-byte key by reformatting and adding parity check bits. It should therefore be easy to produce wrappers to make a library for one key format look like a library for another - or are you having some other problem I haven't noticed?

I need it for keys  analysis in DES and 8 byte key requirement for associated library is creating problem in getting actual keys analysis.
","In DES a key is comprised of 8 bytes with the LSB a parity bit, a nice and regular structure.  There's an implication there for the relationship between input bytes and Permuted Choice 1, which loads the two 28 bit C and D Registers. 
In parlance of the NBS standard a Permuted Choice is a selection permutation not using all the values of a greater whole.
Historically any DES implementation that used 7 bytes wasn't compatible where there are several FIPS/Nist pubs specifying key/ciphertext/plaintext triplets.
If you have a need for a 56 bit number representing a key there's an implication you're using or storing them in a tabular fashion.  Otherwise you could simply guarantee the parity bit is either correct or say '0'.  'Packed' keys are only of interest for saving storage space.
All that said and done if you need a 56 bit number representing a key you could represent 8 bytes of key in a 64 bit value and after identifying the parity bit locations with respect to endian-ness, shift the 64 bit array value obliterating the parity bits one at a time in 8 operations on a 64 bit machine, leaving 56 'effective' key bits.
On a 32 bit or smaller machine you'd also have to track byte position to keep track of bit shift offsets and would have to deal with bits moving between bytes to pack bits into 7 bytes.
For a 32 bit machine you could pack two 32 bit values into 28 bits in opposite directions then merge the proper 4 bits of the second one into the first followed by shifting the second value down 8 bits.
For a big-endian bit in byte numbering system 1 to 8 with bit 8 the LSB (from the standard)
Bits 1-4 go to the C register, with only four  bit 4 values from 8 successive bytes of an input key (described as an input array of bits).  The D block shares bit 4 and uses bits 5-7 to derived 28 bits:

The bigger issue here may be the ability to communicate any interesting finding in terms of keys useful to those dealing with an 8 byte key representation.  It may be handy to have an inverse function available as well.
There's also a relationship between round keys and the C and D concatenated block, shown in Carl Meyers and Stephen Metyas book ""Cryptography, A New Dimension in Computer Security', subtitled 'A Guide for the Design and Implementation of Secure Systems', Wiley Interscience, 1982, ISBN-0-471- 04892-5.
I recreated the table using a derivative of the original BSD libcrypt source.  The significance of this is that C and D bits don't mix in the two 24 bit values derived from Permuted Choice 2 (which is visible in selected key (KS) in round 16 of the table).

","Triple DES is by definition 168 bits (although dependent on the selected option, the key (excluding parity bits) may actually only be 56 or 112 bits instead of 168 bits). There is no way to extend the key length. If you need a longer key length, then you should use an encryption algorithm that supports that key length.
There is no need to ""prove"" this as you ask, as it is described in the standard documents.
Also note that by today standards, DES is considered very weak and Triple DES is considered relatively weak (especially with keying option 2 and 3). I'd suggest you go for a more modern and stronger algorithm like AES.

","No because triple DES means 3 times DES with 3 different keys, or with 2 keys if one key is reused. So the size in bits is either 128 bits or 192 bits - if you count the parity bits as part of the key, 112 or 168 bits - if you do not count the parity and even lower values - if you look at the security strength of 3DES.
The key size of 3DES is not its main weakness. The main weakness is the whole construction with weak keys and the 8 byte blocksize. Furthermore, 3DES is much slower than e.g. AES. Just upgrading the key size will only get you much lower performance, without much benefit to security.
The * in the Oracle provider means ""any"", but that * is only present in the table that displays the key sizes you can use without downloading the unlimited crypto files. The actual key sizes that are supported are listed for the SunJCE provider. That table shows the actual bits in the key used for cryptographic calculations by the way (112 & 168); the encoding will still be 16 or 24 bytes. Note that old(er) Java versions only allow 24 byte keys (which means you have to do some copying of bytes if you have a 16 byte key as input).
Don't use DES, and leave 3DES alone except for backwards compatibility.

From the documentation, I see that this method generates a key and iv based on a password using a C library that calls the same method as openssl to generate the key and iv: EVP_BytesToKey.
What I'm trying to do is to be able to print the IV for any password I specify so I can port the encryption to another language.
Can you think of any method to extract/print this IV vector from a password?
These are the details of the algorithm, mode and padding this library uses:

ALGO: DES-EDE3 
MODE: CBC  
PADDING: PKCS5

The ruby script below prints out the encrypted message but no clue which iv was used.
#!/usr/bin/ruby
require 'encrypted_strings'

data = 'Whackabad'
password = 'bAJLyifeUJUBFWdHzVbykfDmPHtLKLMzViHW9aHGmyTLD8hGYZ'

encrypted_data = data.encrypt(:symmetric, :password => password)
printf ""Data: #{data}\n""
printf ""Encrypted Data: #{encrypted_data}""

I tried to use openssl as it allows me to print the iv and key generated using -p option but it uses a PKCS7 padding instead of PKCS5. So if I run the command below, doesn't print the same encrypted string as the ruby code above.
echo -n 'Whackabad' | openssl enc -des-ede3-cbc -nosalt -a -k bAJLyifeUJUBFWdHzVbykfDmPHtLKLMzViHW9aHGmyTLD8hGYZ

NOTE:
-a: base64 encode, -k: password, and echo -n: removes the new line from the string so its exactly the same size as the ruby in string.
If I add -nopad option, I don't know how to pad the output to get exactly the same encrypted result. 
Any help would be much appreciated
","PKCS7 padding is basically the same as PKCS5. The reason you get a different result on the command line is that it only uses a single hash iteration, where the function used by encrypted_strings does 2048 iterations by default.
The function used, EVP_BytesToKey is described in the OpenSSL wiki, which include details of the algorithm. Reproducing it in Ruby might look something like this (using MD5 and 2048 iterations):
def hash(d, count)
  count.times do
    d = OpenSSL::Digest.digest('md5', d)
  end
  d
end

password = 'bAJLyifeUJUBFWdHzVbykfDmPHtLKLMzViHW9aHGmyTLD8hGYZ'

bytes = ''
last = ''

# For des-ede3-cbc, 24 byte key + 8 byte IV = 32 bytes.
while bytes.length < 32
  last = hash(last + password, 2048)
  bytes << last
end

key = bytes[0...24]
iv = bytes[24..-1]

You can use these values to decrypt the result of your code (add require 'base64' first):
# This is the result of your code:
encrypted_data = ""AEsDXVcgh2jsTjlDgh+REg==""

# enrypted_strings produces base64 encoded results, so we decode first
encrypted_data = Base64.decode64(encrypted_data)

cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher.new('des-ede3-cbc')
cipher.decrypt
cipher.key = key
cipher.iv = iv

plain = cipher.update(encrypted_data) + cipher.final

puts plain #=> ""Whackabad""

","First of all, don't use DES, use AES. 
The best you can do is not saving the password. Instead, use the password as the key to AES. That's means your user will have to type in the password on each boot, but it's the most secure solution.
If you have to save the password locally, you need a consistent key - your code generate a new key each function call. Generate a new key on signup and store it encrypted with a fixed key on shared preferences.

you can only use a key to encrypt a single message.  Encrypting two or more messages with the same key causes the same problems that reusing the key within a message does, but even worse.
Because your key has to be as long as the message to actually be secure, you have a key management nightmare.  How do you store the key that is as long as the message? how do you communicate it securely to whomever wants to read it? What if you want to encrypt a 1GB file? you now need 2GB of storage for your encrypted version
Your key has to be perfectly random.  Any flaws in your random number generator will expose information about your message and key.  Admittedly, this is an issue with algorithms like AES too, but while a bad RNG will reduce the effort to break an AES message/key, it is not nearly as bad as it would be for your scheme

Well known algorithms like AES address these sorts of issues, using short keys to get more security.  a single 256 bit key can be used to encrypt a huge number of messages before it becomes unsafe to use, and managing and storing a 256 bit key is much easier than a 1GB one.

// make sure the private key is long enough

","You use a well-known algorithm in order to not become Dave.
Schneier's Law states that ""any person can invent a security system so clever that she or he can't think of how to break it.""
Which basically means: an security system (encryption algorithm, authentication system, ...) can't be assumed to be secure because the creator says it's secure. Other experts on the topic must review it (and usually review it for a long time) before it can be considered secure.

","Don't make the key generation harder than it needs to be. You want to try each possible value for the first byte of the variable section. But what if that value is 0xFB? Subsequent values would be 0xFC, 0xFD, 0xFE, and 0xFF. But what about the last value? You can assume that they wrap around, to 0x00.

","The library defines the nonce
as that part of the counter block that is not incremented.
Since the block is only 64 bits long, it is hard to securely define how long that nonce should be,
given the danger of wraparound (if you encrypt a lot of blocks) or nonce reuse (if you generate the nonce randomly).
You can instead decide that the nonce is not present, the counter takes the full 64 bits and a random initial value.
iv = get_random_bytes(8)
cipher = DES.new(key, nonce=b'', initial_value=iv)

Finally, I guess that this is only an exercise.
DES is a very weak cipher, with a key length of only 56 bits and a block size of only 64 bits.
Use AES instead.

","Assuming that Crypt module is the one I find at https://metacpan.org/pod/Crypt::CBC it is documented as by default doing (the same as) openssl, apparently meaning commandline 'enc' (openssl library has MANY other options). That is not encryption 
with the specified key (and IV) directly, but instead 'password-based' encryption (PBE) with a key and IV derived from the specified 'key' (really passphrase) plus (transmitted) salt, using a twist on the original (now unrecommended) PKCS#5 v1.5 algorithm, retronymed PBKDF1. See http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/EVP_BytesToKey.html (or the man page on a Unix system with openssl installed) and rfc2898 (or the original RSA Labs PKCS documents now somewhere at EMC).
You say you cannot change the perl sender. I hope the users/owners/whoever realize that original DES, 
retronymed single-DES for clarity, has been practically brute-forceable for well over a decade, and 
PBE-1DES may be even weaker; the openssl twist doesn't iterate as PKCS#5 (both KDF1 and KDF2) should.
Java (with the Suncle providers) does implement PBEWithMD5AndDES, which initted with PBEParameterSpec (salt, 1)
does successfully decrypt data from 'openssl enc -des-cbc', and thus I expect also your perl sender (not tested). 
FWIW if you could change to triple-DES, Java implements PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES using an apparently nonstandard 
extension of PBKDF1 (beyond hash size) that is quite unlike openssl's nonstandard extension, and thus incompatible if the perl module is in fact following openssl.
You would have to do the key-derivation yourself and then direct 3DES-CBC-pad, which isn't very hard.
Also note encrypted data from any modern computer algorithm is binary. ""Printing"" it as if it were text 
in perl, or Java or nearly anything else, is likely to cause data corruption if you try to use it again.
If you are only looking to see 'is there any output at all, and is it visibly not the plaintext' you're okay.

Anyway, one solution might be to add a lightweight decompressor, and compress a part of your bootloader code, and uncompress at runtime.
Adding more software to the blob might sound strange, but you should evaluate this option.

Could anyone please help me? After searching for a rather long time, I just don't know what to do. Thanks in advance. Joe
","I think the problem is with either convertStringToBytes or hexadecimalString.
You can replace:
byte[] keyByte = convertStringToBytes(""00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"");
byte[] data = convertStringToBytes(""00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"");

with:
byte[] keyByte = new byte[8];
byte[] data = new byte[8];

... because in Java, arrays are initialised to zero.
When I run the same code, but with the above (and not convertStringToBytes), then I get the expected result (8C A6 ...)

Since you're still having problems, here's a full program. The output for me is:

You can call func testCrypt(data:NSData, keyData:NSData, ivData:NSData) by passing the data which needs to be encrypted and the key and value in NSData format. 
For example:
let data: NSData! = message.data(using: .utf8) as NSData!; 
let keyData: NSData! = keyValue.data(using: .utf8) as NSData!; 
let ivData: NSData! = ivValue.data(using: .utf8) as NSData!;
var base64cryptString = self.testCrypt(data: data, keyData: keyData, ivData: ivData)

"30991960","Problems with Dictionary key-lookups. No match when there should be","I'm trying to simulate a Meet-in-the-Middle attack on Double DES which works as follows:

So I'm performing the MitM attack by first encrypting a known plaintext m and with all possible values of k1, and then subsequently I decrypt a known ciphertext c with all possible values of k2. Then there should be a match inbetween which gives me k1, and k2. I'm using a cut-down key size of 20 bits instead of 56bit (or 64bit which is what the DES implementation actually wants as input). I just pad with zeroes after 20bits.
I've implemented what I think is a right solution but not getting any matches. 
My two hashtables:
Dictionary<string, string> hashTable = new Dictionary<string, string>();       
Dictionary<string, string> matches = new Dictionary<string, string>();

Encrypting:
Since I'm using a reduced 20bit key, there can be 220 different combinations of 20bits. So for each iteration, I take the counter i, convert it to a binary string representation, then I pad 0s until it makes a 64bit binary value. Then I convert this string to a byte array and encrypt the plaintext with the key. I'm storing the output (intermediary cipher) as the key in the hashTable and the actual key used to get that cipher, as the value.
//First generate all possible intermediary values
for(int i=0; i< Math.Pow(2,20); i++)
{ 
    string key1 = ToBin(i, 20);
    string paddedKey1 = ToBin(i, 20).PadRight(64, '0');

    //First encryption of plaintext1 using key1
    string intermediaryCipher = 
               DESWrapper.DES_Encrypt(plaintext1, ConvertBinaryStringToByteArray(paddedKey1));


    hashTable.Add(intermediaryCipher, key1);

    //Show the current iteration in binary
    Console.WriteLine(ToBin(i, 20));
}

DESWrapper.DES_Encrypt method:
public static string DES_Encrypt(string input, byte[] key)
{
    DESCryptoServiceProvider desCryptoService = new DESCryptoServiceProvider();

    //Reflection necessary otherwise it complains about a weak key, so bypassing that check
    MethodInfo mi = desCryptoService.GetType().GetMethod(""_NewEncryptor"", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);
    object[] Par = { key, desCryptoService.Mode, key, desCryptoService.FeedbackSize, 0 };

    ICryptoTransform trans = mi.Invoke(desCryptoService, Par) as ICryptoTransform;

    byte[] resultArray = trans.TransformFinalBlock(Encoding.Default.GetBytes(input), 0, Encoding.Default.GetBytes(input).Length);
    desCryptoService.Clear();
    return Convert.ToBase64String(resultArray, 0, resultArray.Length);
}

After the encryption I have a hastable with 220 entries. The next thing I do is to make the decryption:
Decrypting:
When I'm decrypting ciphertext1 with the current padded key, the result, if it is the correct key, will be an intermediary cipher which already exists in the hashTable as a Key. So I perform this lookup. If it exists I save the two keys to another hashtable matches. If it doesn't exist I move on.
for (int i = 0; i < Math.Pow(2, 20); i++)
{
     string key2 = ToBin(i, 20);
     string paddedKey2 = ToBin(i, 20).PadRight(64, '0');

    //Decrypting ciphertext1 with key2 (64bit padded)
    string intermediaryCipher =
    DESWrapper.DES_Decrypt(ciphertext1,   ConvertBinaryStringToByteArray(paddedKey2));

    var temp = hashTable.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Key == intermediaryCipher);
    if(temp.Key != null)
    {
        matches.Add(temp.Value, key2);
        Console.WriteLine(""Found match!"");
        Console.ReadKey();
    }

    //Show the current iteration in binary
    Console.WriteLine(ToBin(i, 20));
}

DESWrapper.DES_Decrypt:
public static string DES_Decrypt(string input, byte[] key)
{
    DESCryptoServiceProvider desCryptoService = new  DESCryptoServiceProvider();

    //Again have to use reflection..
    MethodInfo mi = desCryptoService.GetType().GetMethod(""_NewEncryptor"", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);
    object[] Par = { key, desCryptoService.Mode, key, desCryptoService.FeedbackSize, 0 };
    ICryptoTransform trans = mi.Invoke(desCryptoService, Par) as ICryptoTransform;

    byte[] resultArray = trans.TransformFinalBlock(Encoding.Default.GetBytes(input), 0, Encoding.Default.GetBytes(input).Length);
    desCryptoService.Clear();
    return Convert.ToBase64String(resultArray);
}

The problem:
I never get a match, so the hashtable lookup always returns an empty key-value pair. I don't understand why. Eventually it should match but it doesn't.
Could the problem be in the way I'm trying to look up the values in the hashTable?

Other information:
To encrypt the intial plaintext and ciphertext I use a fabricated key which the 17th bit set to 1 and all other 63 bits set to 0. This is done for both keys.
In this way I should get the match quite fast when I'm doing the decryption, but I'm not sure if the problem is here. Including the code anyway:
        private static void GeneratePlaintextCiphertextPairs(out string plainText1, out string plainText2, out string cipherText1, out string cipherText2)
    {
        Random rnd = new Random(Guid.NewGuid().GetHashCode());

        //Generate two random keys of 20 bits padded with 0s to reach 64 bits
        //We need 64 bits because the implementation of DES requires it. Internally,
        //it will only use 56 bits
        byte[] key1 = GenerateRandom64BitPaddedKey(rnd);
        byte[] key2 = GenerateRandom64BitPaddedKey(rnd);

        plainText1 = ""Hello Dear World"";

        //Perform double DES encryption
        cipherText1 = DESWrapper.DES_Encrypt(
                                DESWrapper.DES_Encrypt(plainText1, key1),
                                key2);

        plainText2 = ""Hello Evil World"";

        //Perform double DES encryption
        cipherText2 = DESWrapper.DES_Encrypt(
                                DESWrapper.DES_Encrypt(plainText2, key1),
                                key2);
    }

    private static byte[] GenerateRandom64BitPaddedKey(Random rnd)
    {
        short keySize = 64;

        //The first 20bits are of interest, the rest is padded with 0s
        BitArray bitArray = new BitArray(keySize);

        for (int i=0; i<keySize; i++)
        {
            //if(i < 20) { bitArray[i] = rnd.NextDouble() > 0.5; }
            //else { bitArray[i] = false; }
            if (i == 17) { bitArray[i] = true; }
            else { bitArray[i] = false; }
        }

        //Console.WriteLine(""In Binary: "" + ToDigitString(bitArray));
        byte[] key = new byte[8];
        ReverseBitArray(ref bitArray);     
        bitArray.CopyTo(key, 0);
        return key;            
    }

Thanks for your time.
","So, I've found a solution!
 For starters I've changed a bit of my code. I've created a myPBEkey class with two methods, encrypt and decrypt, both return a Cipher object with the respective ""opmode"":

Then I've changed my saveProfile and loadProfile methos code to:
public void saveProfile(Profile newProfile) {
    try {
            SharedPreferences.Editor editor = prefs.edit();

            String profileJSONfied = new Gson().toJson(newProfile);             
            byte[] encryptedProfile = pbeKey.encrypt().doFinal(profileJSONfied.getBytes(HTTP.UTF_8));       
            byte[] encryptedProfileBase64 = Base64.encode(encryptedProfile, Base64.DEFAULT);            

            editor.putString(PROFILE, new String(encryptedProfileBase64, HTTP.UTF_8));
            editor.commit();
            profile = newProfile;
    } catch (Exception e) {
            Log.i(C.TAG, e.getMessage());
    }
}


public Profile loadProfile() {
    if (profile == null) {
        try {                   
            byte[] decodedProfileBase64 = Base64.decode(prefs.getString(PROFILE, null), Base64.DEFAULT);
            byte[] plainTextProfileBytes = pbeKey.decrypt().doFinal(decodedProfileBase64);

            profile = new Gson().fromJson(new String(plainTextProfileBytes, HTTP.UTF_8), PROFILE_TYPE);

        } catch (Exception e) {
            Log.i(C.TAG, e.getMessage());
    }
return profile;

I think what solved the problem was separating the encrypt/decrypt from Base64 encode/decode, so first we encrypt and then encode the encrypted byte[] and finally store it. The same goes when decrypting, first we decode the encrypted base64 profile and then decrypt the decoded  byte[].   Voilà!
Thanks for your time, hope it helps you.

But I want to know that is it possible 2048 bit encryption and decryption Using DES.
Can anyone please suggest me on this or any different approach for this?
","No.
DES allows only 56-bit keys, but is insecure due to the short key.
Triple DES (3DES) is also judged insecure. (Source: Wikipedia)
There is no provision in DES for other key lengths. 
If you want a secure symmetric cipher scheme, I suggest you look into modern ciphers like AES-256 instead of pursuing old, insecure, ciphers.
Possibly, your demand for a bigger encryption key stems from a misunderstanding of how crypto works. SSL uses the RSA cipher because it is a good public-key cryptosystem. This is useful in other situations than a symmetric cipher like DES. To quote Wikipedia:

RSA is a relatively slow algorithm, and because of this, it is less commonly used to directly encrypt user data. More often, RSA passes encrypted shared keys for symmetric key cryptography which in turn can perform bulk encryption-decryption operations at much higher speed. 

So, after the key exchange is done using RSA, both parties have a shared secret key which may be used for a block cipher like AES to transmit the bulk data rapidly .

","You are most probably experiencing a buffer overflow. The declaration of len comes after back on the stack. If back overflows, then len will be overwritten. Adding another variable (strangePointer) in between adds a gap on the stack that stops len getting overwritten.

","You have several things incorrect in your code. I'll start with the simple answer first:
Your third key isn't even populated with key data. It is random data on the local activation stack. 
memcpy(&key1,key,8);
memcpy(&key2,key + 8,8);
memcpy(&key2,key + 16,8); // <<=== NOTE still key2

Oh, copy-paste, ye are a cruel and heartless wench. Anyway, by removing the variable you're commenting out, this key is moving further up (or down, depending on your implementation) the stack in memory, and the result is a different value . But the bottom line, you're using indeterminate data for your third key.
But that isn't the entire problem. That change in key exposes another issue, you're output length calculation, which is also flat-wrong. This:
int lenout = 0;
while(out[lenout] != '\0') ++lenout;

assumes the length of the output cipher can be found by searching for a 0-byte. The DES algorithm can easily emit such a byte anywhere in an encryption block.  This is plain wrong. The size of the output of a DES_ede3_cbc_encrypt encryption operation is always a multiple of the block size, which for DES is 8 bytes (not coincidentally the size of a DES_cblock), The correct calculation of your output buffer size is:
int lenout = ((len + sizeof(DES_cblock) - 1)/sizeof(DES_cblock))*sizeof(DES_cblock);

which may seem like a helluva lot, but in the end all this does is round up to the nearest multiple of the block length. Further, you don't even need the input buffer. The API will do the calculation for you if you simply pass your input data message and its true length. But I leave that for you to finish (hint: just remove input and pass message).
the result is:

","A couple of things I see:

You derive $key via a substr in PHP; but just take the output of MD5 in C#, are they the same? (e.g. if PHP's value was a hex string, then the 16 bytes of MD5 are 32 characters, which gets trunctated to 24 characters, being a 12-byte (96-bit) value; in C# it's 16 bytes)
Speaking of the keys, if you're using PHP before 5.6, a deficient key was 0-padded (per the documentation of mcrypt_encrypt; C# won't do that for you.  So that's another thing to check.
You have an IV in the PHP code, but ECB doesn't use an IV. That won't be causing your problem here, but it's less than ideal.
Of course, I should at this point warn that ECB is ""too stable"" and doesn't hide patterns in encrypted data, and doesn't hide that you're sending the same message again.
TransformFinalBlock takes bytes, but you seem to be giving it a string here.  Since C# is a strongly typed language, this can't really be the code you're running.
You should avoid talking about the specific implementations of algorithms.  TripleDES.Create() is preferred to new TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider(), MD5.Create() over new MD5CryptoServiceProvider(); and type the variables as just TripleDES and MD5.
The TripleDES object, the MD5 object, and the output of CreateDecryptor() are all IDisposable, so you should really wrap them in a using statement to be more efficient with your native resources.

The most likely culprit for your problem, though, is that you're not generating the same key in both languages.

When generating a key from a password (key derivation) the same method and parameters ned to be used. There are several such methods commonly used, PBKDF2 is one often used and suggested by NIST. Do you know the method and parameters used for the key derivation?

I do this in Clojure, but I guess I'm having more of a Java Problem here. I run this code:
(defn mac2 [key message]
  (let [engine (org.bouncycastle.crypto.engines.DESedeEngine.)
        mac (org.bouncycastle.crypto.macs.ISO9797Alg3Mac. engine)

    (.init mac (org.bouncycastle.crypto.params.DESedeParameters. key))
    (.update mac msg 0 (count msg))
    (.doFinal mac bytes 0)
    (->hex-string bytes)))

And get this output (the exception is thrown at (.init mac ...):
#<byte[] [B@65e47e28> 16
IllegalArgumentException key size must be 16 or 24 bytes.  org.bouncycastle.crypto.engines.DESedeEngine.init (:-1)

Now you see, the prn ist printing put the key-length, which is 16. 
But BouncyCastle complains, that it is not 16 or 24 (changing the key to a key with the length of 24 does not help either)
Also when i run this code, there is no Problem:
(defn mac1 [key message]
  (let [engine (org.bouncycastle.crypto.engines.DESedeEngine.)
        mac (org.bouncycastle.crypto.macs.CMac. engine)
        bytes (byte-array (.getMacSize mac))

    (.init mac (org.bouncycastle.crypto.params.DESedeParameters. (->bytes key)))
    (.update mac msg 0 (count msg))
    (.doFinal mac bytes 0)
    (->hex-string bytes)))

","Alright, I post the working code here. The problem was that I was passing org.bouncycastle.crypto.engines.DESedeEngine instead of org.bouncycastle.crypto.engines.DESEngine.
org.bouncycastle.crypto.macs.ISO9797Alg3Mac splits the key into 3 pieces and passes then the first one to its Engine. Hence DESedeEngine reports a wrong key size, although the original key had the right size.

","The documentation for javax.crypto.Cipher.init says, in part:

If this cipher requires any algorithm parameters that cannot be
  derived from the given key, the underlying cipher implementation is
  supposed to generate the required parameters itself (using
  provider-specific default or random values)

DES CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode requires an Initialization Vector (IV). If you do not provide one (and you should not, because it opens you up to dictionary attacks), a random one will be generated.
But if you want the encrypted data to be the same every time, you need to specify the IV using an IvParameterSpec:
byte[] iv = DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary(""0000000000000000"");
IvParameterSpec ips = new IvParameterSpec(iv);
desCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, iv);

If you do let it generate a random IV, you can retrieve the generated IV with desCipher.getIV().

"28846702","What type of encryption do I need?","Ok, the original task is to track users among 2 ""friendly"" web-sites who are able to share users cookies (lets say, I have example.com and my friend has mysite.com and also he has a domain simple.example.com so he can set cookies on .example.com).
To track users activity we want to set unique cookie, this cookie should be unique and 32 bytes long (ascii). Quite simple from this point of view and can be implemented as such:
md5(microtime)

and that's it, but now we have new constraints:

we should be able to tell who exactly has set the cookie: exmaple.com engine or mysite.com engine
32 bytes longs is a must, still
we should be able to encrypt timestamp (when cookies was issued)
first and last character of the resulting cookie value should be different so we can do A/B testing basing on the cookie (so we could always say if last character of the cookie is ""> K"", show this users ""feature A"")

Given that the resulting string should always be 32 or less characters long and data should be encrypted and decrypted (not by users, of course) and the string should be unique for the users, it makes the task quite complex.
My thought and questions:

we should use symmetric key encryption (solves constraints 1 and 3), but it this case how do we ensure that resulting string is no longer than 32 chars (constraint 2)?
is there other solution on the problem given that amount of data we need to encrypt is: timestamp and microseconds (14 bytes), site-issuer flag (1 byte) = 15 bytes total

My first take was to pack data into binary string and than base64-encode it. The result would be 8-chars long base64-encoded string:
def encode():
    base64( pack('Lv', timestamp, microseconds) )

Add site-issuer flag and chars at the beginning and the end:
def getCookie():
    rand('a'...'Z') + encode() + issuerFlagChar() + rand('a'...'Z')

So, the result is 11 chars long and we meet constraint 2 easily.
But the problem is: this algorithm is not secure for sure, I'm not sure if the resulting string for millions of websites users is unique.
I wonder if I could use DES or AES for this purpose but I'm not sure that the resulting string will always meet constraint 2 (resulting string should be no longer than 32 ascii chars).
Is there symmetric key algorithms that ensure something like ""if you encrypt N bytes with M-bytes key you will have resulting data length of Math.Ceil(N*2+1/M) bytes""? So the resulting length would be predictable?
","Setting aside the fact that you should indeed consult a security consultant, the actual question you pose can easily be answered:

Is there symmetric key algorithms that ensure something like ""if you encrypt N bytes with M-bytes key you will have resulting data length of Math.Ceil(N*2+1/M) bytes""? So the resulting length would be predictable?

Yes there are. And they are called Block Ciphers. 
By definition, every block cipher has the property that the length of the ciphertext is equal to the length of the plain text. In practice most block ciphers (inclusing DES and AES) cheat a bit because they require the plaintext to be padded to the length of the block before they start encrypting. 
In other words, given a plaintext of N bytes and a block size of B, the ciphertext will have a length of B*(Math.ceil(N/B)) bytes.
Note how I am talking about the block size, which is different from the key size. The key size is actually irrelevant in this case.
For example, AES uses a block size of 128 bits, or 16 bytes. This means that if your plain text is between 17 and 32 bytes long, AES will guarantee that your ciphertext is 32 bytes long.

"28846702","What type of encryption do I need?","Ok, the original task is to track users among 2 ""friendly"" web-sites who are able to share users cookies (lets say, I have example.com and my friend has mysite.com and also he has a domain simple.example.com so he can set cookies on .example.com).
To track users activity we want to set unique cookie, this cookie should be unique and 32 bytes long (ascii). Quite simple from this point of view and can be implemented as such:
md5(microtime)

and that's it, but now we have new constraints:

we should be able to tell who exactly has set the cookie: exmaple.com engine or mysite.com engine
32 bytes longs is a must, still
we should be able to encrypt timestamp (when cookies was issued)
first and last character of the resulting cookie value should be different so we can do A/B testing basing on the cookie (so we could always say if last character of the cookie is ""> K"", show this users ""feature A"")

Given that the resulting string should always be 32 or less characters long and data should be encrypted and decrypted (not by users, of course) and the string should be unique for the users, it makes the task quite complex.
My thought and questions:

we should use symmetric key encryption (solves constraints 1 and 3), but it this case how do we ensure that resulting string is no longer than 32 chars (constraint 2)?
is there other solution on the problem given that amount of data we need to encrypt is: timestamp and microseconds (14 bytes), site-issuer flag (1 byte) = 15 bytes total

My first take was to pack data into binary string and than base64-encode it. The result would be 8-chars long base64-encoded string:
def encode():
    base64( pack('Lv', timestamp, microseconds) )

Add site-issuer flag and chars at the beginning and the end:
def getCookie():
    rand('a'...'Z') + encode() + issuerFlagChar() + rand('a'...'Z')

So, the result is 11 chars long and we meet constraint 2 easily.
But the problem is: this algorithm is not secure for sure, I'm not sure if the resulting string for millions of websites users is unique.
I wonder if I could use DES or AES for this purpose but I'm not sure that the resulting string will always meet constraint 2 (resulting string should be no longer than 32 ascii chars).
Is there symmetric key algorithms that ensure something like ""if you encrypt N bytes with M-bytes key you will have resulting data length of Math.Ceil(N*2+1/M) bytes""? So the resulting length would be predictable?
","First of all, you need to know whether you want to encrypt or sign the data.
Encrypting will prevent users from seeing the data, but they are still able to modify it in some ways depending on the encryption type. For example, decrypting a modified ciphertext will simply give corrupted data, it won't fail. 
Signing, on the other hand, will prevent users from modifying the data, that is, your code will be able to detect the data has been modified. A simple algorithm for this is HMAC.
I'll assume you want both. My solution below does both.
Your cookie must be 32 bytes long, which is 256 bits. We are going to use 128 bits for encrypted data and 128 bits for the HMAC. 
For the data, I will encode the timestamp as a 64bit integer (more than enough even if you want to store it to microsecond precision). The site that issued the cookie can be stored as 1 bit if you have two sites, but I'll store it in a 32bit integer because we have plenty of space. Same for a tag you can use for a/b testing.
All the data is exactly 128 bits, 16 bytes. This is the exact size of an AES block. So, we will encrypt it with AES!
The other 16 bytes will be a MAC of the ciphertext (Encrypt then MAC). I used HMAC-SHA256, which has 256bits of output. We only have room for 128bits, so I have truncated it. In theory this makes it less secure, but in practice 128bit is big enough to make a brute-force attempt impossible.
Decrypting the cookie is the reverse process: calculate the HMAC of the given ciphertext and check it matches the given MAC. If so, proceeed to decrypt the ciphertext and unpack the data.
Here's the code:
from struct import pack, unpack
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import hashlib
import hmac


AES_KEY = hashlib.sha256(b""secret key 1 asdfasdf"").digest()
HMAC_KEY = hashlib.sha256(b""secret key 2 asdfasdf"").digest()

# timestamp: 64bit unix timestamp
# site: 32bit integer, which site issued the cookie
# tag: 32bit integer, tag used for a/b testing.
def encrypt_cookie(timestamp, site, tag):

    # Pack the data
    data = pack('QII', timestamp, site, tag)

    # Encrypt it
    aes = AES.new(AES_KEY, AES.MODE_ECB, 'This is an IV456')
    ciphertext = aes.encrypt(data)

    # Do HMAC of the ciphertext
    sig = hmac.new(HMAC_KEY, ciphertext, hashlib.sha256).digest()
    sig = sig[:16]   # Truncate to only first 16 bytes.

    return ciphertext + sig

def decrypt_cookie(cookie):

    # Do HMAC of the ciphertext
    sig = hmac.new(HMAC_KEY, cookie[:16], hashlib.sha256).digest()
    sig = sig[:16]   # Truncate to only first 16 bytes.

    # Check the HMAC is ok
    if sig != cookie[16:]:
        raise Exception(""Cookie has been tampered with"")

    # Decrypt it
    aes = AES.new(AES_KEY, AES.MODE_ECB, 'This is an IV456')
    data = aes.decrypt(cookie[:16])

    # unPack the data
    timestamp, site, tag = unpack('QII', data)

    return timestamp, site, tag

cookie = encrypt_cookie(1, 2, 3)
print(len(cookie))  # prints: 32
print(decrypt_cookie(cookie))  # prints: 1, 2, 3

# Change a single byte in the cookie, the last one
cookie = cookie[:31] + b'0'
print(decrypt_cookie(cookie))  # raises the exception

I'm curious to know why the cookie must be 32bytes though. Seems a weird requirement, and if you didn't have it, you'd be able to use many libraries that are designed to solve exactly this problem, such as Django signing if you're using Django.

"43270291","How can I ensure correct padding in DES encryption?","I am trying to implement a basic Diffie-Hellman protocol and the code succeeds up to the point when it needs to decrypt the sent value using DES. I have looked at a lot of examples in which it was a matter of the keys not matching up, but I am printing their values on both ends of the connection and they are both exactly the same. I have also tried multiple padding schemes as well as changing how the keys were generated.
My last attempt was in adding the parameter IvParameterSpec to the cipher init, but that only solved one of the errors.
I am running this on a single machine where the socket is connecting over the localhost and I have been checking for any issues on either side with the sent data not exactly matching the received data, but nothing is altered in the sending. I did notice, however, that when printing each of the byte arrays on either side of the socket that the client side is much longer than the server with what appears to be padding(?)

","I managed to figure out a way to solve this (though I suspect it is very inefficient). The issue was due to the readFully method on the server side. I was reading the answer into a 128 byte array and the decrypt function saw the empty slots in the byte array as something instead of nothing. 
To solve this I replaced the input section with the following, which reads each individual byte and creates an array of bytes with the exact length of the incoming message.
            ArrayList<Byte> totalBytes = new ArrayList<Byte>();
            while(true){

","3DES uses three keys. The python function you are using probably derives three keys from the key argument you pass, probably splitting it in three parts.
To use the OpenSSL function, you have to generate 3 keys with 8 bytes each (or a 24 bytes key split in 3).
I adapted the code I found here to use ECB instead of CBC. But, for security reasons, you should consider using CBC, or even AES encryption instead of 3DES.
The example only shows how to use the DES_ecb3_encrypt function with hard coded keys. In a final solution, you have to generate your own keys, using a good RNG.

"33622590","Tinkering with pyDes mode of operation","So, in pyDes, a cryptographic library of DES, there is an API, which goes like this pyDes.des(key, [mode], [IV], [pad], [padmode]). An usage of it goes like this k = des(""DESCRYPT"", CBC, ""\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"", pad=None, padmode=PAD_PKCS5) - where I can either use CBC or ECB mode of encryption.However, as an assignment from my professor, I am told to encrypt using pyDes library, but using CBC and Counter Mode manually. 
I managed to do CBC mode fine, unfortunately I am stuck with the counter mode.
Using the given api of des(key, CBC, IV ...) I can only use IV when I use CBC or ECB mode of operation. I can not use it something like des(""hello"", mode = None, ""foo"",....) where ""foo"" is my IV.( I am supposed to implement Counter mode of operation and the iv is random in every single iteration)
So, my question is did anyone faced this issue, and tried to overcome it.
","The main operation that you need to isolate in order to implement some mode is the actual block cipher without a mode of operation or padding. pyDes doesn't seem to provide direct access to the block cipher directly, but you can emulate it easily with the ECB mode. ECB is a simple execution of the block cipher on all input blocks in the same way. 
The idea would be to create a counter input stream, execute ECB on the input stream to get the key stream and then XOR every byte of the plaintext with the corresponding byte in the key stream.
Steps for CTR mode:

Generate a random nonce (IV) in the range of 0 to 1<<64 (DES block size) which is the starting counter:
import random
r = random.SystemRandom()
nonce = r.randrange(0, 1<<64)

Convert the counter for each block of the plaintext to bytes with struct.pack('>Q', counter) and increase the counter by one
Repeat until you have at least as much bytes in the counter stream as in the plaintext
Encrypt the counter input stream with ECB mode and any available padding
XOR the key stream and the plaintext and throw away the rest of the key stream (if any)

Since CTR mode is a stream cipher, you can use the exact same operation for decrypting with the only difference that the nonce must be supplied from outside. You can prepend the nonce to the ciphertext so that it can be used for decryption. It doesn't have to be secret, but it needs to be unique if the same key is used. 
Note that the block size of DES and 3DES doesn't permit to encrypt many ciphertexts or long ciphertexts with CTR under the same key. If you do then you need to change to a block cipher with a bigger block size like AES.

Example: I want to encrypt a message by using receivers email address(Public Key) and sender will send this message to receiver. Once receiver receives this encrypted message, he will decry-pt this message by using his private key.
This looks okay theoretically, but I am struggling to do this practically.
I don't know 

how to encrypt a message by using receivers email address 
how receiver will decry-pt encrypted message? 
how receiver will get his private key?

I am expecting help from this platform, as I already spent a lot of time on searching this.
What I have tried:
I tried encryption and decryption by using RSA algorithm, but the problem here is RSA generates his own public and private key pair. And I can not use receivers email address as a public key to encrypt message.
Thank you in advance.
Ashok
","You can generate secure symmetric keys from an email address, any string for that matter, with a key derivation function such as PBKDF2 (aka Rfc2898DeriveBytes).
RSA is asymmetric encryption with separate keys for encryption and decryption, symmetric encryption such as AES uses one key for both encryption and decryption.
Asymmetric encryption  such as RSA has the advantage of two keys where the encryption key can be publicly known. But it is very slow and the data size, the keys are large (2048-bits is a currently secure size) and the data length is limited to the key size, it is generally used to encrypt symmetric keys. There is no control over symmetric key pair creation other than length.  Use asymmetric encryption only when a public/private key pair must be used.
Asymmetric encryption such as AES is fast, has smaller keys with 128-bits common and secure and can handle data of essentially any length.

Because the decrypt() method takes SOOOOOO long to decrypt a 100KB file, the device asks me to abort or wait.
If I use img_decrypt() it works in not time at all. Which to me makes no sense they are doing the same thing.
Im trying to use decrypt() to decrypt the first MB of the video.
On the computer everything works fine.
Any thoughts might be helpful.
Both methods work for decrypting a fully encrypted file, decrypt() take way too long though.
One more thing. decrypt() decrypts the data on the write. img_decrypt() decrypts the data on the read. No idea if that effects anything.

","Java has no primitive type that allows you access to anything lesser than a byte. You'll therefore need to work on bytes, and not bits in Java.

Use bytes. The Cipher.doUpdate and Cipher.doFinal methods use bytes, rather an array of them. Use a suitable padding scheme to account for any unpadded data.

","This is quite a reasonable question, despite the down-votes.
Many encryption modes (such as CBC) require that the input is a multiple of the block size of the underlying cipher (.e.g. 16 bytes for AES or 8 bytes for DES). To achieve this one uses a padding scheme.
Whether you can encrypt a plaintext with an arbitrary bit-length depends on what padding scheme you use.
The most commonly used padding scheme (i.e. PKCS #5 padding) prepends n bytes of value n to the plaintext.
This obviously requires that the plaintext is in bytes. But there are lesser known padding schemes that allow arbitrary inputs. For example, the so called ""bit padding"" appends a single 1 bit to your plaintext and the appends as many 0 bits as necessary until the length of your input is a multiple of the block size of your cipher. For example, the ISO/IEC 9797-1 standard is proposing this.
When deciding, whether you want to support arbitrary bit-lengths in your application you also have to consider the crypto libraries that you want to use. While some crypto algorithms have been standarized to allow inputs of arbitrary sizes in bits, it may not be implemented by your crypto library.
E.g. the hash function SHA-1 is well defined for inputs such as the 4-bit string '0101', but you
might have some trouble finding a library that can actually compute this hash.

       (byte) '1', (byte) '2', (byte) '3', (byte) '4', (byte) '5',
       (byte) '6', (byte) '7', (byte) '8'
}; 
cMasterKey = DESUtils.get8byte(new string(Buffer));
MasterKey = DESUtils.decrypt(cMasterKey, Key);

The ""Buffer"" comes from an USB Drive which has a File on it which contains a Masterkey of 16 Chars.
I really don't know how to realize it in PHP. I tried a lot of things like pack('C*', $var) and things like that but I didnt get the same result.
Is there anyone here who knows how to handle it? I dont know if I'm on the right way but I tried things like this:
$key = pack('C*', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8);
$masterbyte = pack('C*', $buffer);
$decmasterkey = mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_DES, $key, $masterbyte, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB);

","'1' in C# is a character literal. Characters can be directly cast to a byte under the default ASCII assumption. So '1' is actually a 0x31 byte and not a 0x01 byte like you have in PHP.
You ""want"":
$key = ""12345678"";

Whether the decoding of $buffer is correct depends on its content and how you read it.

Some notes:

Don't use DES nowadays. It's really insecure. AES is a better alternative.
Never use ECB mode. It's deterministic and therefore not semantically secure. You should at the very least use a randomized mode like CBC or CTR. It is better to authenticate your ciphertexts so that attacks like a padding oracle attack are not possible. This can be done with authenticated modes like GCM or EAX, or with an encrypt-then-MAC scheme.

","What I'm doing is getting to the last byte of the key and I'm using RCL. Then I'm doing it on the byte before, until I get to the first byte. What I am doing is using RCL as normal but then I'm JC and if the carry flag equals 1, use the OR operation on the last byte of the key and turn on the right bit.

"42404347","Migrate String encryption from Ruby to Java","I need to produce the same encrypted string in Java as the one built with the Ruby encrypted_strings library. I've tried many different ways but my Java code keeps returning a different output, and I'm unable to understand what I'm doing wrong.
Below is the ruby script that produces the desired output that I can't get right in Java. 
#!/usr/bin/ruby
require 'encrypted_strings'

data = 'Whackabad'
password = 'bAJLyifeUJUBFWdHzVbykfDmPHtLKLMzViHW9aHGmyTLD8hGYZ'

I had a look at the library, and it seems to be using DES-EDE3-CBC as the default algorithm for encryption. I deduce from here that I should use DESede or TripleDES algorithm and CBC mode. As the padding option, I'm using PKCS5Padding cause the library is calling pkcs5_keyivgen.
Below is the Java code that tries to reproduce the same output unsuccessfully.

I've seen people encrypting data from Java to be decrypted from Ruby and vice-versa with different algorithms so I think this can be achieved but I can't see what's wrong. Do you have an idea? If so, that'd be of much help! 
Thanks 
","The first thing to do is to derive the IV and key from the given password.
From the link above, you will get an encoded IV and KEY that corresponds with ""VDiJjncs4ak="" and ""s9e42J3PpmQv8n5T8L3zzuFaGdrzK/wU"" respectively.
This means that the key and IV vector used in the Java code are wrong as it was said in the comments.
Below is the resulting Java code:
public class SymmetricDESedeCipher {
    private static final String DATA = ""Whackabad"";
    private static final String ALGORITHM = ""DESede"";
    private static final String XFORM = ""DESede/CBC/PKCS5Padding"";
    private static final String KEY = ""s9e42J3PpmQv8n5T8L3zzuFaGdrzK/wU"";
    private static final String IV = ""VDiJjncs4ak="";

    private static byte[] encrypt(String data,
                                  SecretKey key, String XFORM, byte[] iv) throws Exception {
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(XFORM);
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, new IvParameterSpec(iv));
        return cipher.doFinal(data.getBytes());
    }

    public static void main(String[] unused) throws Exception {
        DESedeKeySpec spec = new DESedeKeySpec(new BASE64Decoder().decodeBuffer(KEY));
        SecretKeyFactory secretKeyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(ALGORITHM);
        SecretKey secretKey = secretKeyFactory.generateSecret(spec);

        byte[] encBytes = encrypt(DATA, secretKey, XFORM,  new BASE64Decoder().decodeBuffer(IV));

        System.out.println(""Data: "" + DATA);
        System.out.println(""Encrypted Data: "" + new BASE64Encoder().encode(encBytes));

","As the error message says, there is no method getBytes() for the type InputStream.
You need to read the key and store it as a String. 
eg. 
rather than FileInputStream fisk ... do
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(""Key.txt""));
String key = br.readLine();
br.close();

(assuming that your key file just contains the key on one line)
Then change your encrypt/decrypt and encryptOrDecrypt methods to take in the key as a String rather than InputStream
eg. encrypt(String key, InputStream is, OutputStream os)
Then you can call SecretKeySpec(key.getBytes(),""DES"");
Also you realise that this is DES, not AES as you say right? If you want to use AES you will need a 128 bit key (or 192/256 bits)

","You’re missing a call to $cipher->finish; after the loop, for both encrypting and decrypting, so you’re cutting of part of the last block in both cases.

The CBC algorithm must buffer data blocks internally until they are even multiples of the encryption algorithm's blocksize (typically 8 bytes). After the last call to crypt() you should call finish(). This flushes the internal buffer and returns any leftover ciphertext.

You need something like this:
while (sysread(F,$buffer,1024)) {
    print $cipher->crypt($buffer);
}
print $cipher->finish;

gprof shows that sboxes function occupied 51.78% of the time.
In sboxes(uchar aucData[6], ...), I was given 48 bits, split them into 8 slot, each slot of 6 bits.
for each slot:

combine first bit with last bit to get X;
obtain middle 4 bit to get Y;
do something with (X, Y);

For example, 011110 is a slot, so X = 00 and Y = 1111.
To implement this, I wrote MACRO to GET/SET bit in memory, here is relative code:
#define LOCATE(ptr, index) (((char *)(ptr))[(index) >> 3])

#define GET_BIT(ptr, index) (LOCATE((ptr), (index)) & (((uchar)0x80) >> ((index) % 8)))

And here is the code to get (X, Y)
uchar basePos = 0x00;
for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
    x = 0;
    y = 0;
    basePos = i * 6; // to locate the slot
    // combine first bit with last bit 
    if (0 != GET_BIT(aucData, basePos)) {
        x |= 0x02;
    }   
    if (0 != GET_BIT(aucData, basePos + 5)) {
        x |= 0x01;
    }   
    // get continuous 4 bits
    for (int j = 1; j <= 4; ++j) {
        if (0 != GET_BIT(aucData, basePos + j)) {
            y |= (0x01 << (4 - j));
        }   
    }   
    // do something with (x, y)
}

So my question is, I was given 48 bits, how to get the middle 4 bits as fast as possible?
","Without lookup table:
typedef unsigned long long u64;

void sboxes(uchar aucData[6])
{
    u64 v = aucData[0] + (((u64)aucData[1]) << 8)
    + (((u64)aucData[2]) << 16)
    + (((u64)aucData[3]) << 24)
    + (((u64)aucData[4]) << 32)
    + (((u64)aucData[5]) << 40);

    for(int i = 0; i < 8; i++) 
    {
        uchar x = ((v & 1) << 1) | ((v >> 5) & 1);
        uchar y = ((v >> 1) & 0xF);
        // do something with x, y
        printf(""x: %hhu, y: %hhu\n"", x, y);

        v >>= 6;
    }
}

Full disclaimer: I didn't benchmark. But it should be fast. You may be able to do the packing into u64 faster, if it's still too slow.

This is what I am saying the answer in the encrypted output in online calculator is 0000, and mine is completely different:

","Change 
byte[] b = c.doFinal(M.getBytes()); 
to 
byte[] b = c.doFinal(DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary(M));
Besides, use mode ECB in your code (because you marked ECB in your picture). Like:
Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(""DES/ECB/NoPadding"");

The String.getBytes() encodes the String into a sequence of bytes using the platform's default charset, storing the result into a new byte array. In your case which is an array of length 16 containing values 56 55 56 55... ASCII representation of 8787...
What you need is converting the Hex 8787... to binary.

","The DES operation (both encryption and decryption) ignores the lsbit of each byte of the key. That is, if you flip any of the lsbits within the key, the operation remains the same. That's what is happening in the keys you tried: the ASCII code for space is 0x20, while the ASCII code for ! is 0x21; they differ only in the lsbit. So, if the key has a byte with the ASCII code for a space, you could replace it with a !, and it'll still be able to decrypt. Similarly, the ASCII code for * is 0x2a, while the ASCII code for + is 0x2b; also differs only in the lsbit.
In the original DES standard, the lsbit was supposed to be used as a parity check bit (with each byte always having odd parity). It was supposed to be a weak error check for manually entered keys. Nowadays, no one does this parity check, and so the lsbit gets ignored.

","DES has a 56-bit key, the lsbit of each key byte was initiallly used for parity, now it is ignored.
The answer is: do not use DES! DES is insecure and has been superceeded by AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) AES was specifically designed to replace DES.
Further one should not use a character string as a key, the best practice is to derive an encryption key from the character string with a function such as PBKDF2 (Password Based Key Derivation Function).

","You're making at least two major mistakes.

You have to use the same key to decrypt as you used to encrypt. You can't just generate a random key and except it to be able to decrypt anything. Cryptology isn't magic. You will have to arrange for the decryption key to be preserved somehow, transmitted if necessary, securely, and used at the decryption step.
You're encrypting once with the SealedObject and again with the CipherOutputStream; then in the reverse direction you're decrypting once with the CipherInputStream and again via the SealedObject. This won't actually work, because the Cipher object isn't in comparable states at sender and receiver, and in any case it's pointless. Lose either the SealedObject or the Cipher streams.

The cipher works with 64-bit blocks and I'm having a tough time deciding how to partition the data so that its useable. In case your wondering the data will be coming from a file and I'm just going to pad it with zeroes until the nearest multiple of 64. Here's what I've been thinking about.
Store an array of longs.
With an array of longs I can traverse over each block in the fewest amount of steps. But, will the logical operations, like XOR, work properly?

","Use a data structure that fits your need the best.
If you never want to split you values then use long. If you need to split your data into two halves then use int.
If you need to have more control over your data you should go with byte[]. Because internal representation is not an issue for you (because you use Java) there is no need to use byte[] internally.
When it comes to communiction with other computers (e.g. via network socket or file) it is possible that the byte order is important. Then it would be better to use a byte[] as then you have better control over the byte order.
A BitSet is for other use cases and not feasible to be used in encryption.

","You should use the most efficient primitive type for your cipher. So if you primarily use 64 bit instructions, please go for long. If you use primarity 32 bit instructions then int is probably the best type. I'll let you guess the types for 16 and 8 bit operations.
Note that you should not present this interface directly to the outside world. Instead you should use an interface based on byte arrays (just like, e.g. Cipher). You don't want to confront your users with a ton of grief with regards to big endian, signed/unsigned etc. Besides that, ciphers are usually defined for messages of a specific size in bits or bytes.
Certainly do not use BitSet. It's a horrible (unbounded) interface with many peculiarities. It is absolutely not fit for this kind of operations.

","Your code here:
    while ((bytesReads = fis.read(encText)) != -1) {
        fis.read(decrypt.doFinal(encText), 0, bytesReads);
    }

Is rather obviously wrong: you need to write the plaintext generated by calling decrypt.doFinal just like you do during encryption. Currently you are overwriting the generated plaintext by the next block(s) of ciphertext because you call read twice in the loop.
Furthermore, depending on your DES Cipher implementation, you forgot about the IV.

A lot of other things are wrong as well, including:

the stream handling using getAvailable();
the use of the 56 bit DES cipher;
the use of ECB mode;
the repeated calls to doFinal (which results in a very large overhead and insecure code);
not using the CipherInputStream and CipherOutputStream (etcetera);
using a string as the key;
forgetting to close your streams when an exception occurs (use the try with resources);
the printStackTracke() exception handling;
the use of static fields as variables. 

Using the platform encoding within new String(encText) is only likely wrong.

Note that using the wrong key / ciphertext combination will likely also result in this error.

Somehow, I get stack corruption error in debugger for both encrypt and decrypt functions. I traced down the problem around DES_cbc_encrypt(). What am I doing wrong? I'm using compiled binaries for OpenSSL: openssl-1.1.0e-vs2012 on 64-bit.
","The reason, why I came back here, is because I noticed (although not producible from the sample code), that both DES_cbc_encrypt() and DES_cbc_decrypt() functions expect 8-byte aligned inputs. Thus in the unfortunate case, if the struct here would have been not a multiple of 8 in size, DES_cbc_encrypt() would write past the end of buffer, thus the obvious stack-corruption. Although, when padding is not explicitly disabled, sizeof() still returns the sum of the sizes of the members, so this case I understand is the task of the application programmer. Maybe someone could light up more on this.

","Security aspects aside (as has been pointed out, DES and ECB, as well as no key derivation is insecure), you are using a deprecated crypto.createCipher() function which derives a key from the provided password.

The implementation of crypto.createCipher() derives keys using the OpenSSL function EVP_BytesToKey with the digest algorithm set to MD5, one iteration, and no salt. The lack of salt allows dictionary attacks as the same password always creates the same key. The low iteration count and non-cryptographically secure hash algorithm allow passwords to be tested very rapidly.

Use crypto.createCipheriv() instead, which uses the provided key as-is:
const crypto = require('crypto')
let enterJS = 'h';
let enterStr = null;
function encrypt(plaintext, algorithm) {
    var keyStr = ""imtestKey"";
    var key = Buffer.alloc(8, keyStr);
    var cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(algorithm, key, Buffer.alloc(0));
    cipher.setAutoPadding(true);
    var ciph = cipher.update(Buffer.from(plaintext));
    var ciphf = cipher.final();
    return Buffer.concat([ciph, ciphf]).toString('hex');
}
enterStr = encrypt(enterJS, 'des-ecb').toUpperCase();
console.log(""===============>>>> ENTER STR : "" + enterStr);

The createCipheriv API will reject your 9-byte long key, because DES requires an 8-byte key. I made a workaround to take the first 8 bytes from the provided password as the key and now it's printing your desired result.

","I think reason is simple.
In server you use strlen() for getting content length, so you have ignored terminating '\0' at end of your string. You decrypt your content and print it ignoring that terminating '\0'. So you print garbage from memory at end of decrypted message.
You need to send data including terminating '\0' by something like using strlen(dataBuffer)+1, or you need to add it to received content.
2 side note:

DES algorithm is a very insecure algorithm, NEVER use it.
In socket programming it is always suggested to send data length alongside data. For example, send 2 bytes that show encrypted data length and then send data. So you can manage data much better at client.

","When you have data in the underlying stream and want to decrypt it to an array, use CryptoStreamMode.Read and Read.
Since you have an empty stream that is collecting data, you should use CryptoStreamMode.Write and Write.

Standard caveats apply:

DES is a terrible, broken algorithm
Don't use ASCII (or Unicode) data as keys
Don't assume that encrypted data can be represented as ASCII (or Unicode) data
Never add cryptography into released software unless you can explain


What it does
Under what conditions it will be deemed out of date
How you will grow it up when it's out of date


And how it won't break all your users, or make them insecure, when you do so.

","The for loop that contains:

Note that the code contains binary to hexadecimal conversion and I/O *right within the permute function. I'd expect at most some logging functionality in the heart of the cipher.

","The short answer is yes, but it's not a very practical solution
Lets say you did manage to create a system that broke a video up across machines for distributed decoding.  You first would have to be careful on how you did ""break up"" the video.  You must always start at keyframe and ending right before the next keyframe.  Next you would have to decode your clip.  Once decoded, the decoded data must be transfered to the computer rendering the video.  An uncompressed 1080p @ 30 FPS stream would be ~182 megaBYTES/s, which is more than a gigabit connection can handle.

the given encrypted text is not fully decrypted

The encrypted text you gave is fully decrypted. The problem is not (yet) the decryption but your encryption. As documented des.NewTripleDESCipher returns a cipher.Block and cipher.Block.Encrypt encrypts as documented only the first block of the input data. Given that DES has a block size of 8 byte only the first 8 byte of the input data are encrypted, i.e. https://. 
This means in order to encrypt all data you must encrypt all blocks. Similar you need to decrypt all blocks when decrypting - but cipher.Block.Decrypt also decrypts only a single block.
Apart from that DES is broken, so don't use it for something serious.

This NULL pointer than leads to a segmentation fault inside the strcmp() function. So try to remove that newline char at the end of each input line. Hope this works

","In addition to the remark of Jon, the TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider defaults to CBC mode encryption / decryption. You would need to specify ECB mode for C#, noting that ECB mode is insecure.

Actually, to provide full security, the ciphertext should always be different for each encryption / decryption with the same key. That's what the (random) IV is for in CBC mode.

Nowadays we try to use an authenticated cipher such as AES / GCM, preferably within a secure protocol. For instance one that uses a secure key derivation method that is not MD5.

","Sounds like a character set issue to me.
Likely you're storing the binary value into a VARCHAR (or other non-binary type), and a character set conversion is being applied, and some of the bytes aren't valid ""characters"" in the characterset for the column, either that, or, the stored values are being translated on retrieval, and ""unknown"" encodings are being replaced with question marks.
As a test, you could try using the MySQL HEX() and UNHEX() functions on the binary values, though that will effectively double the size of the strings.  There shouldn't be any characterset problem with character strings representing hexadecimal digits. (I don't think there are native base-64 encoding/decoding functions in MySQL.)
Alternatively, you might try storing the encrypted values in a column with a datatype that supports binary data, with no characterset translation, e.g. VARBINARY rather than VARCHAR.

A couple of things I as unsure on:

I padded the key with 01, that is why the output on the first line ends with 01. I tried padding it with 0s but that did not work either. And the required length is 8 bytes. So not sure if I did that right.
I am not completely sure what offset means in the SecretKey constructor(2nd argument). I am assuming it should be 0.
My main question is why is test(the cipherText) 16 bytes? According to http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ernet.in/~sourav/DES.pdf page 13 it should be only 8 bytes.

I also know my code is not working because I know what the final encrypted output should be.
","You don't specify the mode and padding for the cipher in the call to getInstance(), so the provider will choose default parameters. Your provider is defaulting to ""PKCS5Padding"", so it add 8 bytes with a value of 0x08 to your plain text before performing the DES encryption.
To avoid platform-dependent behavior, it's very important to specify a complete transformation when creating a Cipher instance: algorithm, mode, and padding. If you don't want padding, say so:
Cipher ciph = Cipher.getInstance(""DES/ECB/NoPadding"");
SecretKey blah = new SecretKeySpec(key, ""DES"");

Why did you pad your key? Why wasn't your key 8 bytes long to start? If the first 7 bytes are intended to be used as the actual key, and lack parity bits, you can't just slap a byte on the end; you need to expand the key to eight bytes, appending one parity bit to each 7-bit chunk.
If you use the parity-adjusted key, 3EDCD613A754513B, and no padding, the cipher text is C094C47D7F89E219. Is that what you are expecting?

I got a different result, why? And I don't know  if SecureRandom is a iv ?
","Always use a fully qualified Cipher string. Cipher.getInstance(""DES""); may result in different ciphers depending on the default security provider. It most likely results in ""DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding"", but it doesn't have to be. If it changes, you'll lose compatibility between different JVMs.
What you need to do in PHP to achieve compatibility with Java is to use ECB mode instead of CBC mode and apply PKCS#5 padding (same as PKCS#7 padding). This answer shows an implementation of that padding. You just have to use the correct block size which is 8 for DES.

Never use ECB mode. It's deterministic and therefore not semantically secure. You should at the very least use a randomized mode like CBC or CTR. It is better to authenticate your ciphertexts so that attacks like a padding oracle attack are not possible. This can be done with authenticated modes like GCM or EAX, or with an encrypt-then-MAC scheme.
The IV must be unpredictable (read: random). Don't use a static IV, because that makes the cipher deterministic and therefore not semantically secure. An attacker who observes ciphertexts can determine when the same message prefix was sent before. The IV is not secret, so you can send it along with the ciphertext. Usually, it is simply prepended to the ciphertext and sliced off before decryption.

"52328004","DES algorithm in VNC authentication with Python","I am trying to connect with a VNC server (Vino) using VNC authentication. Reading the RFC 6143 - The Remote Framebuffer Protocol, we can see how VNC authentication works. 
It is using a challenge-response protocol where the server sends a challenge of 16 bytes and the client answer with the challenge encrypted with his key. The encryption is using DES algorithm.
Using TigerVNC and Wireshark I have sniffed this process in order to do this process with Python.
E.g.
This is the traffic which I have sniffed with Wireshark between Vino and TigerVNC. It works.
Server                                                                 Client
|------------------   Server protocol version: 003.007  ----------------->|
|<-----------------   Client protocol version: 003.007      --------------|
|------------------        Security types: 2        --------------------->|
|<-----------------    Security type selected: VNC (2)  ------------------|
|-------------------        Authentication result: OK           --------->|
|-----  Authentication challenge: b4a7257a443426527dd9d987fa6b099f  ----->|
|<----  Authentication response: 4838c102d8cbb1decd38ecdbec533bc7   ------|

The challenge and response are bytes, not hex strings.
But when I encrypt the authentication challenge with Python, I got different results. I have tryed using differents block cipher mode of operations, without success.
E.g.
>>> from pydes import des
>>> challenge = ""\xb4\xa7\x25\x7a\x44\x34\x26\x52\x7d\xd9\xd9\x87\xfa\x6b\x09\x9f""
>>> key = ""testingg""
>>> d = des()
>>> ciphered = d.encrypt(key,challenge,padding=True)
>>> import binascii
>>> ciphered = d.encrypt(key,challenge)
>>> binascii.hexlify(ciphered)
'4f16bc072bf34903e753b3f968b1aa56'

Or with another Python module:
>>> import pyDes
>>> des = pyDes.des(""testingg"")
>>> challenge = ""\xb4\xa7\x25\x7a\x44\x34\x26\x52\x7d\xd9\xd9\x87\xfa\x6b\x09\x9f""
>>> e = des.encrypt(challenge)
>>> binascii.hexlify(e)
'4f16bc072bf34903e753b3f968b1aa56'
>>> binascii.hexlify(des.decrypt(e))
'b4a7257a443426527dd9d987fa6b099f'

Am I missing something? The RFC doesn't show anything about encryption modes or IV vectors..
Moreover, I have shows source code of TigerVNC, which is wrote in Java, and It is not appers to have any special thing about the challenge encryption.

","Data to be encrypted with a block cipher such as DES or AES must be an exact multiple of the block size in length. The solution is to add padding to the data to be encrypted, PKCS#5 padding is the usual padding for DES and probably the default for Javascript. Unfortunately mcrypt does not support PKCS#5 padding, only a non-standard zero padding.
Potential solutions:

Use a better encryption function than mcrypt, see the comment to the question.
Specify no padding in Javascript and manually add zero padding.
Specify no padding in mcrypt and remove the padding manually.

It is better tospecify all options and no to rely on defaults.

You shouldn't use DES for anything.  It is obsolete and recommended against.
You shouldn't store encrypted passwords unless you actually need to decrypt them.  For any sort of login system, you should use bcrypt
Your insert problem is mostly likely due to the fact that you're trying to store the encrypted, binary, data.  You probably forgot to encode the encrypted value to a base64 string.

Original DES aka single-DES has been broken since last century, and should not be used.
In Java, instantiating plain DES like that defaults to DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding (in general Java treats PKCS5 padding as including PKCS7). ECB does not use an IV, and DES has no other parameters, so a java Cipher object for DES/ECB does not need or use any type of parameters object. However, in most applications, ECB mode even with a good cipher (not DES) is insecure and should not be used.
If you change to a more secure mode that does use an IV, like CTR CBC OFB CFB, or better in most applications but only supported in j8+ GCM, then IvParameterSpec is indeed the correct type to use. 
However, with modes that use an IV, using a fixed or otherwise duplicated IV is almost always insecure, so you must have a process that provides a unique IV for each encryption and the corresponding decryption(s). 
This is often done by choosing a random IV when encrypting and transmitting and/or storing it along with the ciphertext (sometimes simply as the first part of the ciphertext) to be used when decrypting, but other designs that accomplish the same thing are possible. For CTR-based modes including GCM, especially when applied to a stream of traffic between the same parties, using a (scaled) counter provides uniqueness. For CBC the IVs must not only be unique but unpredictable; random is usually easiest for this but it is possible to use an encrypted counter.
Both key and IV (when used) should actually be bits not characters. However it is often convenient to represent them in characters using hex (as you did) or base64. Such character representations can be transmitted and received by a huge variety of methods, of which DataInput/OutputStream or ObjectInput/OutputStream is one among many. There are also many ways to transmit bits (binary) on all networks used in this century (although back in the 1970s and 1980s this was often problematical). Choosing among these may depend on what else your programs are doing and in particular whether they already use things like HTTP, XML, JSON, etc.

","You've only changed the end of the ciphertext. This holds the last block of encrypted plaintext. However, usually the plaintext doesn't end on a block boundary. In that case PHP will perform zero padding until a block boundary is reached. These zero bytes are removed by the trim function (you should use rtrim and only remove \0 bytes).
Now if you change the bytes of the last block then the decrypt will result in random bytes. That block may start - by chance - with the same characters, followed by any other - possibly unprintable - characters. In that case the string printed on screen may display the same.
You should really:

use AES (MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128);
perform PKCS#7 compatible padding;
use CBC mode encryption with a random IV;
prefix that IV to the ciphertext;
add an authentication tag (using HMAC-SHA-1);
possibly encode the IV + ciphertext + tag.

","byte[] and String should be kept apart. The main error is that a random sequence of bytes (the encrypted text) might easily be incorrect UTF-8. UTF-8 is a multi-byte format, where high bits mark a multi-byte sequence in a specified way, 10xxxxxx being a continuation byte for instance.
However to encrypt a String (Unicode) it is very appropriate to use UTF-8. A single byte encoding would be lossy; say if the text contained both Greek and Bulgarian.
byte[] data = text.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
text = new String(data, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

These are the overloaded versions from the String constructor and getBytes method, with charset specified. Otherwise it is platform dependent, hence disastrous in communication to another computer.
But as soon as you have binary data, byte[], do not convert it to (Unicode) String, which is a (costly) conversion, redundant and error prone.
Hence one often sees an additional conversion of the binary data to Base64, receiving a longer ASCII string.

","DES has a block size of 64 bit or 8 byte. Modes of operations like CBC and ECB are block based, but in order to encrypt plaintexts of arbitrary it is necessary to use a padding scheme like PKCS#5/PKCS#7 paddings to pad the arbitrary plaintext to the next multiple of the block size.
The padding itself contains the information how many bytes where added for PKCS#5 padding. Since 8 byte is already a multiple of the block size, a full padding block is added. It this weren't the case, you would be able to reliably disambiguate plaintext and padding after decryption.

"3242056","What is wrong with my DESKey (BlackBerry API)?","I have an application developed on BlackBerry JE 4.6.1 that decrypts an information from WebServer using DES algorythm. 
If I send encrypted information to the server, it is decrypted well. But in case if the server sends an encrypted data, 
I do not get the correct value after decryption.
Key is supposed to be the same and crypted information is sent base64 encoded.
During debugging I have found out, that after DESKey is created it's inner data differs from the byte array passed to the constructor.
For example if I create the DESKey the next way
String keyStr = ""2100000A"";
DESKey desKey = new DESKey(keyStr.getBytes()); // pass the byte array {'2','1','0','0','0','0','0','A'}

the method desKey.getData() returns the byte array {'2','1','1','1','1','1','1','@'} that differs from the initial key bytes.
So is it possible for such behavior of the DESKey to be the reason why I can not decrypt data from server? 
Thank you.
","The desKey.getData() behaviour is expected. 
The doc states:

DES operates on 64 bit blocks and has
  an effective key length of 56 bits. In
  reality, the key is 64 bits but there
  are 8 bits of parity used which means
  that the effective key length is only
  56 bits. Every eighth bit is used for
  parity and it is the least significant
  bit that is used for parity.

Parity bit definition:

A parity bit, or check bit, is a bit that is added to ensure that the number of bits with the value one in a set of bits is even or odd. Parity bits are used as the simplest form of error detecting code.

So, this is how it happens:
'2' => 0x32 => 00110010 => 0011001 + (parity bit 0) => 00110010 => 0x32 => '2'
'1' => 0x31 => 00110001 => 0011000 + (parity bit 1) => 00110001 => 0x31 => '1'
'0' => 0x30 => 00110000 => 0011000 + (parity bit 1) => 00110001 => 0x31 => '1'
'0' => 0x30 => 00110000 => 0011000 + (parity bit 1) => 00110001 => 0x31 => '1'
'0' => 0x30 => 00110000 => 0011000 + (parity bit 1) => 00110001 => 0x31 => '1'
'0' => 0x30 => 00110000 => 0011000 + (parity bit 1) => 00110001 => 0x31 => '1'
'0' => 0x30 => 00110000 => 0011000 + (parity bit 1) => 00110001 => 0x31 => '1'
'A' => 0x41 => 01000001 => 0100000 + (parity bit 0) => 01000000 => 0x40 => '@'

I have managed to get it working for android platform, but it fails on ios showing an 401 error. As far as I can tell, the difference happens in this segment:
Ntlm.setCredentials = function(domain, username, password) {
    var magic = 'KGS!@#$%'; // Create LM password hash.
    var lmPassword = password.toUpperCase().substr(0, 14);
    while (lmPassword.length < 14) lmPassword += '\0';
    var key1 = Ntlm.createKey(lmPassword);
    var key2 = Ntlm.createKey(lmPassword.substr(7));
    var lmHashedPassword = des(key1, magic, 1, 0) + des(key2, magic, 1, 0);
    var ntPassword = ''; // Create NT password hash.
    for (var i = 0; i < password.length; i++)
        ntPassword += password.charAt(i) + '\0';
    var ntHashedPassword = str_md4(ntPassword);
    Ntlm.domain = domain;
    Ntlm.username = username;
    Ntlm.lmHashedPassword = lmHashedPassword;
    Ntlm.ntHashedPassword = ntHashedPassword;
};

When I log the result of 'lmhashedPassword' after going through the des() function, it simply returns 'A'. Whereas on android, it returns a longer string. Something in the des function must be cutting it off, but I cannot see what.

In case it may be relevant, I have changed the way the request is made too. When the user clicks login, the following promise is called:
Ntlm.login('url')
            .then(() => {
                console.log('Success');
                appSettings.setString('token', 'abc123');
                this.router.navigate(['/ilt']);
            })
            .catch(error => {
                console.log('Failed');
                appSettings.remove('token');
                alert('Failed! ' + error );
            })

I created a new login function in the ntlm.js file:
Ntlm.login = function(url) {

    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        if (!Ntlm.domain || !Ntlm.username || !Ntlm.lmHashedPassword || !Ntlm.ntHashedPassword) {

            Ntlm.error('No NTLM credentials specified. Use Ntlm.setCredentials(...) before making calls.');
        }
        var hostname = Ntlm.getLocation(url).hostname;
        var msg1 = Ntlm.createMessage1(hostname);
        var request = new XMLHttpRequest();

        request.onload = function() {
            var response = request.getResponseHeader('WWW-Authenticate');
            var challenge = Ntlm.getChallenge(response);

            var msg3 = Ntlm.createMessage3(challenge, hostname);
            request.open('GET', url, false);
            var authorization = 'NTLM ' + msg3.toBase64();
            request.setRequestHeader('Authorization', authorization);

            request.onload = function() {
                if (request.readyState == 4 && request.status == 200) {
                    resolve(request.status);
                }
                else if (request.readyState == 4 && request.status != 200) {
                    reject(request.status);
                }
            };
            request.send(null);
        };
        request.open('GET', url, false);
        request.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'NTLM ' + msg1.toBase64());
        request.send(null);   
    })

};

This is all working fine on the Android version, just cant understand why it isnt on ios. Very frustrating! If anyone can make sense of this, I would be eternally grateful. I realise it is a lot of code and quite niche area!
Many thanks,

UPDATE
I think there may be a difference in the way console.log behaves in Android and iOS, which could explain some of the missing characters. I created a new test account (testuser / testing), and logged various points to try and establish what was happening in the NTLM process step by step. Here are the logs for android:
NTLM WALKTHROUGH ON ANDROID

Step 1: Creates a cryptographic hash of the users password:
lmHashedPassword = -UE}{}*ªÓ´5µî
ntHashedPassword = |SÏ¥ê}�;�� ûQ£õ

Step 2: Sends first request to the server, with the following Authorisation header:
NTLM TlRMTVNTUAABAAAAA7IAAAUABQBEAAAAJAAkACAAAABHQVRFV0FZLlNUUEFVTFNDQVRIT0xJQ0NPTExFR0UuQ08uVUtBRE1JTg==

Step 3: Server sends a challenge back to client:
¡2@�³Q%Ï

Step 4: Client encrypts this challenge with the hash of the users password and sends back to server (response).
The Authorization header is: NTLM TlRMTVNTUAADAAAAGAAYAKQAAAAYABgAvAAAAAoACgBAAAAAEgASAEoAAABIAEgAXAAAAAAAAADUAAAAAYIAAEEARABNAEkATgB0AGUAcwB0AHMAdABhAGYAZgBHAEEAVABFAFcAQQBZAC4AUwBUAFAAQQBVAEwAUwBDAEEAVABIAE8ATABJAEMAQwBPAEwATABFAEcARQAuAEMATwAuAFUASwBsEslcvTQhhY3+RgKtqufBzFrmufFKNkAHXJRcA6ThOAU105+NJBGnsn2ri6Ziuv8=

Step 5: Now the server has sent the username, challenge and response to the Domain Controller.
The DC compares and returns status of: 200

Here are the logs for iOS:
NTLM WALKTHROUGH ON IOS

Step 1: Creates a cryptographic hash of the users password:

NTLM TlRMTVNTUAABAAAAA7IAAAUABQBEAAAAJAAkACAAAABHQVRFV0FZLlNUUEFVTFNDQVRIT0xJQ0NPTExFR0UuQ08uVUtBRE1JTg==

Step 3: Server sends a challenge back to client:
q�v¹,

Step 4: Client encrypts this challenge with the hash of the users password and sends back to server (response).
The Authorization header is: NTLM TlRMTVNTUAADAAAAGAAYAKQAAAAYABgAvAAAAAoACgBAAAAAEgASAEoAAABIAEgAXAAAAAAAAADUAAAAAYIAAEEARABNAEkATgB0AGUAcwB0AHMAdABhAGYAZgBHAEEAVABFAFcAQQBZAC4AUwBUAFAAQQBVAEwAUwBDAEEAVABIAE8ATABJAEMAQwBPAEwATABFAEcARQAuAEMATwAuAFUASwAP9HN5WjPCs9hMRrmttnYHieFrThwyUAWanKWtVdzOqDOJ2isUdQeV0ISmv9TT0ek=

Step 5: Now the server has sent the username, challenge and response to the Domain Controller.
The DC compares returns status of: 401

Seems the credentials are worked out the same, and then the challenge returned from the server is random. But on iOS, the challenge seems to be missing characters - possibly due to the type of characters. The client then encrypts the challenge with the hashed passwords and sends back to the server. I imagine it might be this part which is not correct on iOS.

","Base 64 utilizes the / and + characters. You need to do either one of the following:

URL-encode your base 64 string;
Use a base 64 variant that is safe for URL's.

The first one is easier to code but may be less efficient than the second one (if there are many / and + characters in the encoding).
Note that you can use a simple string replacement to utilize #2, so it is not that hard.

It works when string has an even number of characters.
Is it even real to encrypt/decrypt data with an odd number of characters ?
","DES, as well as AES does not have limit on what can be encrypted, the problem is elsewhere.
It looks like it is a Bas64 encoding problem given the line the error occurs on.
Perhaps trailing ""="" characters were stripped from the Base64.
Information:
DES is a block based encryption algorithm, as such the input must be an exact multiple of the block size, 8-bytes for DES. When the input is not always an exact multiple padding must be added, the easiest way to to let the implementation do that for you by specifying padding, generally PKCS#5 for DES.
For SymmetricAlgorithm use Padding Property PKCS7, it is always best to fully specify everything and not rely on defaults.
algorithm.Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7;

In C, it invokes undefined behavior, see: Left shifting with a negative shift count
To answer your question: You can't make code that invokes undefined behavior return consistent results across platforms. That code needs to be modified to not shift by a negative number.

I have an application which is developed to work under SharePoint but it's basically ASP.NET code. I have an encrypted connection string which I decrypt it in memory and store it in a configuration object to access the database. My configuration object is static (accesible through a Service Locator pattern), which I later use to seed a LINQ-to-SQL data context.
My internal key for decryption is stored, privately in a class as private static readonly string myPassword = ""MyPassword""; (just an example, the actual password is more complex and valid). There's no single statement, anywhere, referencing that field, except one on a static method using it as a parameter for another decryption method (instance method), which instantiates a new DESCryptoServiceProvider with it.
And still, I get the following exception from time to time in my production server logs:
Exception type: CryptographicException
Exception message: Specified key is a known weak key for 'DES' and cannot be used.

As such, the connection string decryption fails and, of course, the database is not accessed anymore. Poof, application down.
How is this even possible? 
Disclaimer: This is an old application I am maintaining. The description I provide here is to help troubleshoot, but I cannot change the way it works internally. Some will agree that this is not the best approach but the application has been running without a problem for more than 2 years and suddenly these exceptions are taking it down.
Update: I've been requested to clarify with a stack trace of the exception, but I cannot provide one full stack trace for NDA reasons. What I can tell is the following:

The object throwing the exception is the System.Security.DESCryptoServiceProvider.CreateDecryptor(Byte[] rgbKey, Byte[] rgbIV) method
The original key (the one we actually use) does validate and does not generate an exception. Still, we get this exception from time to time (not always), without knowing which is the current value which does not validate
The instance of the DESCryptoServiceProvider is stored statically, privately, in a helper class
This is all triggered by System.Web.HttpApplication.InitModulesCommon(), to initialize the application internal parts

Also, here is an obscured stack trace:

","It doesn't sound like anything's mutating the object. It sounds like ""something"" (if you'd posted the stack trace it would be clearer) is validating the DES key... and complaining that it's a known weak key.
Ideally, you should change your password to be more secure, of course - but if you can't, you should look at exactly where that exception's coming from, and see if there are settings somewhere controlling how and when it's validated.

","Have a look at your wrapper SymmetricEncryption.Decrypt. My guess would be that the issue is in there. How it creates the Key from your password. Does it use PasswordDeriveBytes or some other half baked solution?

"17134649","Openssl Encrypting, Decrypting doesn't work with DES","I'm developing a simple application where there are a Client (C) and a Server (S).
Client gets text from std input, encrypts it, and sends it to the Server.
Since, I don't know if the text from user is multiple of 8 byte( I'm using des),
in my encryption function I always call:
EVP_EncryptUpdate
and then:
EVP_EncryptFinal_ex
int encrypt(EVP_CIPHER_CTX *x, char * in, char * buf_out )
{

    int text_len;
    int loutU;
    int loutF;


    text_len = strlen(in) + 1; // i.e : adding '\0'

    if( EVP_EncryptUpdate(x, (unsigned char *)buf_out, &loutU, ( unsigned char*) in, text_len) == 0 )
        return -1;

    if( EVP_EncryptFinal_ex(x, (unsigned char *) &buf_out[loutU], &loutF) == 0 )
        return -1;  

    return loutU + loutF;
}

All works fine but only for the first message.
For example if I send as first message:
""12345678"" (that are 8 bytes), and as second message:
""hello"".
My server will print as second message:
""0x08 0x08 0x08 0x08 0x08 0x08 0x08 0x08 Hello"".
0x08 8 times is the padding that on client side EVP_EncryptFinal_ex added.
Another Example:
If first message is ""prova daje"".
And ""Hello"" as second.
Server will print as second message: 
""je 0x05 0x05 0x05 0x05 0x05 hello""
Note that je and 0x05 for 5 times are part of first message, indeed:
""prova da"" are 8 bytes ,  ""je'\0'"" are 3 bytes, so 0x05 is  the padding.
How can I avoid this?
I would like to have no dependency between the first and the second message.
Do I have to call clean_up each time?

EDIT:
I solved, since I called EVP_EncryptFinal_ex I had to call EVP_init to can reuse
the context.

Do not use DES, it is to weak for curent work. Instead use AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) if you need to do your own encryption.

I would appreciate it if someone could explain why this happens and how I can stop it from happening when writing this code to a txt file (without changing the decrypted output) since the write() function has the same effect on the text. I'm using python 2.7 on vista by the way.
","When you are in the Python shell and print some variable in this way:
>>> print var

What you get is the output of the __str__ method of the object var.
Instead, when you ""print"" a variable in this other way:
>>>> var

What you get is the output of the __repr__ method of the object var.
The difference between these two methods is that the return value of the __repr__ function should be a valid python expression. Ideally you should be able to get a new object identical to var by simply doing a copy/paste of the output of its __repr__ method (by the way this is not possible in every case). However the output of the __repr__ method is intended to be used only for debugging purpose.
The __str__ method, instead, is intended to return you a human-readable and concise representation of the object.
In your case what you get when you write >>> ciphertext is the ""formal"" representation which translate any non-printable character in its hexadecimal representation. Instead, when you use the print statement you get the ""raw"" data containing the non-printable characters as they are.

","DES ECB is a block mode cipher with a 64-bit (or 8-octet) block and is designed to work only on data that is a multiple of the block size. Plus OpenSSL DES_ecb_encrypt isn't really ECB mode but rather the DES block primitive: it encrypts or decrypts one block of exactly 64 bits not less and not more. What you are trying to do should not and cannot work. 
Properly-designed cryptosystems that need to handle variable-length data, which many do, either use a stream cipher, a stream mode (like CTR), or a block mode (but not ECB, see below) with padding -- there are a number of standards to choose from; OpenSSL's EVP_{Encrypt,Decrypt,Cipher}* module uses PKCS5/7 padding by default, although you can turn it off. 

Note DES has been broken and obsolete for two decades, and in most applications where ECB mode has been used even with a good primitive it allows attacks that reduce or eliminate security. If you intend to actually secure something, drop this and use a program designed by someone who knows what they are doing -- but that's offtopic for SO.

More ontopic for SO, your program uses the wrong pointer type for the calls to DES_ecb_encrypt, which your compiler should have detected and warned you about; however, because of the way C defines arrays it is unlikely any implementation will actually fail because of this error. Also you didn't #include the required prototypes for exit malloc memcpy and this could result in bugs or crashes on a system with size_t larger than int.

However, within this for loop I also want to make sure that the possible keys are unique i.e. I have an if statement, which checks whether the possible key already exists in the HashMap. If not, then it uses it to encrypt the plain text and store the cipher text and the possible key in the HashMap. Aftwards, I try to find the keys, which have matching intermediate cipher text by iterating through the HashMap with a foreach and compare each intermediate cipher text from the encryptions with the intermediate cipher text from the decryptions. 
However, I am unable to find the match as it takes too long to finish. I have been waiting for like 2 hours now without any result. If I remove the if statement, which checks if the possible key is already in the HashMap it finishes in like 10 seconds.
for (int size = intermediateCipher.size(); size < Math.pow(2, 20); size++) { // intermediateCipher is my HashMap consisting of <String, byte[]>
    byte[] possibleKey = generateDesKey(); // generateDesKey generates a key of 64 bits
    if (!intermediateCipher.containsValue(possibleKey)) {
        intermediateCipher.put((encrypt(possibleKey, plainText)).toString(), possibleKey);
    }
}

int count = 0;
for (Entry<String, byte[]> arr : intermediateCipher.entrySet()) {

    String temp = (decrypt(arr.getValue(), cipherText)).toString();

    if (intermediateCipher.containsKey(temp)) {
        count++;
    }
}

I should mention that only 20 bits of the DES key is effective. That is why there are 2^20 possible keys. Furthermore, if I don't have the if statement, which checks if the possible key is already in the HashMap, I get 510 matches, which is too much.
UPDATE:
I have tried using a Set in order to store the keys first and then used the keys from the Set to encrypt etc. However, instead of having a for, which iterates from 0 to 2^20, I have tried with a while loop, which checks iterates as long as the Set has elements. However, I have tried running this approach for over 10 mins without any result. It never gets out of the loop.
for (int i = 0; i < Math.pow(2, 20); i++) {
            possibleKeySet.add(generateDesKey());
        }
        System.out.println(possibleKeySet.size());

        for (int i = 0; i < possibleKeySet.size(); i++) {

            intermediateCipher.put((encrypt(possibleKeySet.iterator().next(), plainText)).toString(),
                    possibleKeySet.iterator().next());
        }

        System.out.println(""ss "" + intermediateCipher.size());

        int count = 0;
        for (Entry<String, byte[]> arr : intermediateCipher.entrySet()) {

            String temp = ((decrypt(arr.getValue(), cipherText)).toString());
            if (intermediateCipher.containsKey(temp)) {
                count++;
            }
        }

I have read that for a set hasNext() always returns true for a non-empty collection. So, I have tried with a for each, but the size of the hashMap is never the same as the size of the set of keys, which doesn't make sense to me as I use every key in the set:
for (int i = 0; i < Math.pow(2, 20); i++) {
            possibleKeySet.add(generateDesKey());
        }

        System.out.println(possibleKeySet.size());

        for (byte[] key : possibleKeySet) {
            intermediateCipher.put((encrypt(key, plainText)).toString(),
                    key);
        }

","Map.containsValue() will have a linear time as you are iterating blindly over all the map values. As per the method javadoc:

Returns true if this map maps one or more keys to the specified value. More formally, returns true if and only if this map contains at least one mapping to a value v such that Objects.equals(value, v). This operation will probably require time linear in the map size for most implementations of the Map interface.

To take advantage of a hash lookup you should check the keys with Map.containsKey():
if (!intermediateCipher.containsKey(possibleKey)) {
  ...
}

","Map.containsValue() must check every map entry.  That costs O(n) in the size of the map.  Supposing that the number of duplicates does not exceed a fixed fraction of all keys generated, checking containsValue() on each iteration of your loop then costs an aggregate O(n2) in the number of keys generated.  For a million keys that's awfully expensive.
Consider instead keeping an auxiliary Set of the keys stored so far, and testing membership in that set instead of directly testing the values in the Map.

"1303150","General Design Question about data binding in WPF","I'm starting to use Binding in my WPF project and I'm actually confused about few things on the presentation side (XAML).
So I want to populate a TreeView with a List of Categories. I know how to write the right HierarchicalDataTemplate for my List of Category instances. 
<HierarchicalDataTemplate ItemsSource=""{Binding Path=ChildrenCategories}"" DataType=""{x:Type src:Category}"">
      <TextBlock Text=""{Binding Path=Name}""></TextBlock>
</HierarchicalDataTemplate>

But what now I don't know is from where to get the list. I have here 2 solutions :

I got a Library Singleton class
    which return me the right
    arborescence, then I need to use an
    ObjectDataProvider in my xaml which
    would call the
    Library.Instance.Categories method. (Which means that the controller has to be completely separated from the UI).
I got a Property ListCategories
        in my page interactionLogic
        (OpenUnit.xaml.cs), and bind the
        tree with it.

I'm not sure about the purpose of the xaml.cs files, what are they made for? Is it normally used to store the properties (and act as a controller) or simply to have a back-end for the UI (for example get values from the UI?)?
In case the xaml.cs file is used as a controller, how do I bind my data to it, I've tried many solutions without success,my only success was with the use  of static binding.
I would appreciate any comment or recommandation about UI and Logic Binding in WPF, hopefully I will get less confused.
Thanks in advance, 
Boris
","After reading this great article, I got a little bit less confused :
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx
The article is about the Model View ViewController pattern, and how WPF integrates it. So it seems that xaml.cs files should be used as the ViewController here, and should hold the properties.
It actually make sense since it's not a good practice to mix the View and the Data, we want the designers should have a completely independant work to do.
Also for the solution 2) it is possible if you set the data context to the current file.

Another example - I put print in writeToFile method and tested write and read :
    String test = ""Test symmetric file enc / dec"";
    File fileTest = new File(""src/server/testFileEnc"");
    if(!fileTest.exists()) {
        fileTest.createNewFile();

                    String decryptedFromFile = new String(aCrypto.readFromFile(fileTest , sessionKey));
    System.out.println(""DECRYPTED DATA "" + decryptedFromFile);

"55280102","Why AES Produce Different result and Why DES not Produce","I'm trying to change encryption algorithm of existing project. But i have a little bit confusion. When i use ""PBEWithHmacSHA512AndAES_256"" as a parameter, it produce different result but when i use ""PBEWithMD5AndDES"" as a parameter it produce same result. My functions are : 
 public static synchronized String encrypt1(final String textToEncrypt, final String pathPublicKey) throws Exception {

    final byte[] enc = cipher.doFinal(utf8);

    // Encode bytes to base64 to get a string
    return new sun.misc.BASE64Encoder().encode(enc);
}

Any suggestions, ideas will help me to figure out what's going on here.
Also this is produce different results: 
    KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""JCEKS"");
    keyStore.load(new FileInputStream((pathOfJKSfile)), password.toCharArray());
    Key key = keyStore.getKey(keyName, keyPass.toCharArray());
    byte[] raw = key.getEncoded();
    SecretKeySpec secretKeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(raw, ""PBEWithHmacSHA512AndAES_256"");
    final AlgorithmParameterSpec paramSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, ITERATIONS);

    final Cipher cipherEncrypt = Cipher.getInstance(ALGORITHM);
    cipherEncrypt.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKeySpec, paramSpec);

    final byte[] enc = cipherEncrypt.doFinal(messageBytes);
    System.out.println( new sun.misc.BASE64Encoder().encode(enc));

And i know that cipher.init() using ""JceSecurity.RANDOM"" for pruducing different results.

Both algorithms, PBEWithHmacSHA512AndAES_256 and PBEWithMD5AndDES, first generate an encryption key by processing a password, a salt and an iteration count (using HmacSHA512 and MD5, respectively) and then encrypt the plain text (with AES-256 and DES, respectively) using this key and the CBC-mode. When the Cipher-instance is initialized, a pseudo-random initialization vector (IV) is generated that is required for the CBC- mode.
In the context of PBEWithHmacSHA512AndAES_256, the IV is generated using the SecureRandom implementation of the highest-priority installed provider, at least for the Cipher#init()-method used in the code (note that there are several overloads of the Cipher#init()-method and that a SecureRandom-instance can also be passed explicitly). I.e. with each Cipher-initialization a new (random) IV is generated and therefore the encrypted text is always different, even for an identical plain text. For this reason, the encrypted text in your examples changes in this context.
In the context of PBEWithMD5AndDES, the IV is only determined by the password, the salt, the iteration count (and of course the MD5-hash-algorithm itself). Therefore, the IV and the encrypted text do not change in case of repetition (provided that password, salt, iteration count etc. are the same). For this reason, the encrypted text in your example does not change in this context.
The generation of a new, random IV during the Cipher-initalization makes sense with regard to the following requirements for the IV: For security reasons, an IV in CBC-mode (btw this also applies to other modes) may only be used once under the same key. In addition the IV must be unpredictable.
PBEWithMD5AndDES is deprecated.

EDIT:

The use of an IV is standard nowadays (for security reasons). A lot of information can be found on the Internet on this topic e.g. here. In the following I will only describe a few basic things.
The IV used for encryption must be stored in some way because it is required for decryption. The IV does not have to be kept secret, so that it is usually concatenated with the encrypted data (e.g. before the encrypted data) and stored together with them. During decryption, both parts can be separated because the length of the IV is known (16 Byte for AES). E.g for the concatenation in the encryption-method something like the following is used (let iv and enc be the byte-arrays with the IV and the encrypted data, respectively): 
byte[] result = new byte[enc.length + iv.length];
System.arraycopy(iv, 0, result, 0, iv.length);
System.arraycopy(enc, 0, result, iv.length, enc.length);

and in the decryption-method the corresponding counterpart (having in mind that the length of an IV in AES is 16 Byte).
In the encryption-method the IV can be determined with Cipher#getIV() (this must of course happen after calling Cipher#init()).
In the decryption-method you have to pass the IV to the PBEParameterSpec-ctor (e.g. let iv be the byte-array with the IV):
IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(iv); 
AlgorithmParameterSpec paramSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, iterationCount, ivSpec);

The generation of an IV can also take place outside the Cipher-class, see e.g. Generating random IV for AES in Java. Then you have to pass that IV in the encryption-method in the same way as above described for the decryption-method. 
Note, in connection with an IV some points have to be considered e.g. using a mode without an IV (e.g. ECB), using an IV consisting exclusively of 0-values, using a predictable IV or using an IV more than once under the same key etc. drastically reduces security in general, see e.g. here!

","In this line:
K1 = P8_swap(P10leftPtr, P10rightPtr);

you change the value of K1 but that change is local to the function and will not change the value of K1ptr in main.
If you want to change the value of K1ptr in main you need to pass a pointer to K1ptr to the function. However, that would seem a bit strange as you initialize K1ptr to point to the char-array K1[9]. My guess is that you don't want to change the pointer value in the function but just copy some data into the ""pointed-to"" array.
BTW:
Your P8_swap is wrong. You return a pointer to P8_Output which is a local variable. Never do that! When the function returns, the local variable goes out of scope (aka no longer exists) so the returned pointer points to illegal memory. If you really want something like that, you must use dynamic memory allocation.

","The problem is here
K1 = P8_swap(P10leftPtr, P10rightPtr);

and here
K2 = P8_swap(P10leftPtr, P10rightPtr);

You are basically overwriting the value of the pointers, so that they point to something else that is eventually destroyed at the end of the function call.
So, instead, you need to copy the return value of P8_swap() call into the pointers' content, like so:
char* tmp = P8_swap(P10leftPtr, P10rightPtr);
memcpy(K1, tmp, strlen(tmp)+1);

...

tmp = P8_swap(P10leftPtr, P10rightPtr);
memcpy(K2, tmp, strlen(tmp)+1);

You can read more about memcpy here.
or a basic for loop would also do it
char* tmp = P8_swap(P10leftPtr, P10rightPtr);
for(int i = 0; i < strlen(tmp); i++) {
  K1[i] = tmp[i];
}


Edit:
As @4386427 just pointed out, the tmp would be in this case an unsafe pointer to use, since the return value P8_swap() might get destroyed in the meantime - because it's defined locally within the function.
However, if the memory was allocated dynamically for the value (within the function) - as I initially assumed, then the pointer would be safe to use. See demo.

","You must set initialization vector (IV) to the same value for encryption as well as for decryption. Because new IV is automatically generated for each new instance of DESCryptoServiceProvider, your IV differs and decryption is not successfull.
The reason that half of the message is decrypted correctly results from usage of CBC mode (which is default mode), which has one really nasty property, that only first block of encrypted message actually depends on value of IV, so potential attacker can decode all message, except first block, without knowing correct IV (of course, correct Key is still needed). So it is not recommended to use this mode. See Block cipher mode of operation for more info about this.
So solution is easy - store somewhere IV used for encryption and use the same IV for decryption. If possible, use another cypher mode too. Somthing like this:

Its like this, When the input Blocksize is <=64bits the cypher size is 128bits for sure because of the PaddingMode.PKCS7 in DES. The below code is an example of what I'm saying. 
   static void Main(string[] args)

        DESCryptoServiceProvider des = new DESCryptoServiceProvider();
        des.BlockSize = 64;
        des.IV = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(AesIV);
        des.Key = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(AesKey);
        des.Mode = CipherMode.CBC;
        des.Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7;


        ICryptoTransform des_demo = des.CreateEncryptor();
        byte[] encrypted = des_demo.TransformFinalBlock(input_text , 0, input_text.Length );
        string encrypt = Convert.ToBase64String(encrypted );
        return encrypt;
    }

But I want to have cyphersize more than 128bits (specially 192bits) from same input Blocksize which is <=64bits from this code. How I can I do that? Is there any way to fix up the output cipher size to 24bytes? 
","This problem can be solved very easily. Just change the UTF8 to Unicode. Now, each input data characters will be 2byte each instead of 1byte. So, 8byte (64bits) input will be 16byte (128bits) and when PKCS#7 is used in 16byte data it becomes 24byte (192bits). This is the way to get 192bit cipher from 64bit input.

Does this seem reasonable? Or is there anything better.
Also, its not clear to me whether the default PBEWithMD5AndDES algorithm in jastypt performs multiple iterations or just one.
","Encryption operations are always quite slow. Anyway, if you are using a fixed salt generator, jasypt 1.9.2 includes an optimization that saves some initialization calls and might improve your performance: http://jasypt.org/changelogs/jasypt/ChangeLog.txt
As for iterations, note that iteration in PBE encryption (two-way) is only performed in order to obtain the encryption key (it is obtained by applying a hash function on the password, which is not a byte[] encryption key but an unlimited-strength String). The amount of iterations performed on the hash function that obtains the key can be configured in most encryptor objects by means of a keyObtentionIterations property (and if not, javadoc will explain the value chosen).

Essentially, I have a tuple with the appropriate permutations, and I need to bit shift to the correct location.
For example, using a key:
K = 00010011 00110100 01010111 01111001 10011011 10111100 11011111 11110001
Would move the 57st bit to the first bit spot, 49th bit to the second bit spot, etc...
K+ = 1111000 0110011 0010101 0101111 0101010 1011001 1001111 0001111
Current code:
def keyGen(key):
    PC1table = (57, 49, 41, 33, 25, 17,  9,
                 1, 58, 50, 42, 34, 26, 18,
                10,  2, 59, 51, 43, 35, 27,

keyGen(""133457799BBCDFF1"")

The logic I thought would work was to enumerate the tuple of permutations, and for each bit of my old key, look in the enumeration to find the index corresponding the the bit, and bit shift the appropriate number of times, but I just can't figure out how to go about doing this. It may be that I am approaching the problem from the wrong angle, but any guidance would be greatly appreciated!
","Ok, I ended up figuring a way to make this work, although this probably isn't the most efficient way...
prior to calling the function, turn the binary number into a list:
keyBinary = bin(int(key, 16))[2:].zfill(64)
keyBinary = [int(i) for i in keyBinary]

Kplus = permute(PC1table, keyBinary)

def permute(mapping, permuteInput):
    permuteOutput = []

    for i in range(len(mapping)):
        permuteOutput.append(permuteInput[mapping[i % 56] - 1])

    return permuteOutput

Using three distinct keys is the best way to go.  In fact, it's the only option for the US Government (and US Government contractors):

3.2.1.2 Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA)
The Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA), also known as Triple DES, uses the DES
  cryptographic engine to transform data in three operations. TDEA is
  specified in SP 800-67.   
TDEA encrypts data in blocks of 64 bits, using three keys that define
  a key bundle. The use of  TDEA  using  three  distinctly  different 
  (i.e.,  mathematically  independent)  keys  is approved and  is 
  commonly  known  as  three-key  TDEA  (also  referred  to  as  3TDEA 
  or  3TDES). 
Other  variations  of  TDEA,  where  two  or  three  of  the  keys 
  are  identical,  are no  longer  approved for applying cryptographic
  protection  because of increased computing power or weaknesses in the
  algorithm.

"22657135","C# DES encryption output not always matching expected","I'm doing some work querying an API using that has been provided by another (large, multinational) company. One of the parameters needs to be encrypted using DES (I know, it's not considered secure, but a. the API has already been developed and b. the data encrypted is fairly easily available to the public anyway). I've got to the point where 2 of the 5 queries I've been asked to run are working, but the other 3 are not.
This is where things start to confuse me. The 2 that work fine are obviously encrypting the number correctly. However, the company in question has advised that the encrypted outputs do not match theirs for the 3 that are failing. I don't really understand how this can be, but they've shown me that, for example, one expected encrypted output should have been ""9B2653BF0C348D8BA8643266BEBF329FDD643D2E4F432062"" but my output was ""9B2653BF0C348D8B710BCAF2B3DBFCBFDD643D2E4F432062"" - it seems that 16 characters in the middle in each instance are not matching their output.
My code to encrypt the data is this:
public string GetEncryptedValue(string baseValue)
{
    using (var desProvider = new DESCryptoServiceProvider
          {
            Mode = CipherMode.ECB,
            Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7,
            Key = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(Key)
          })
    using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())
    using (var cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(memoryStream, 
            desProvider.CreateEncryptor(), CryptoStreamMode.Write))
    {
       var data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(baseValue);
       cryptoStream.Write(data, 0, data.Length);
       cryptoStream.FlushFinalBlock();

       return ByteArrayToString(memoryStream.ToArray());
    }
}

private static string ByteArrayToString(ICollection<byte> byteArray)
{
    var hex = new StringBuilder(byteArray.Count * 2);
    foreach (var singleByte in byteArray)
    hex.AppendFormat(""{0:x2}"", singleByte);
    return hex.ToString().ToUpper();
}

Can anyone make suggestions as to what the cause might be? I've tried different encoding types. I know the padding mode is PKCS#5, but as per this SO answer the algorithms are the same. The company in question are large and it often takes several days for questions to go between several countries to get an answer which is often irrelevant.
Thanks.
","It turns out the problem was at the other company's end, and backs up exactly Oleg Estekhin's comment: ""The encrypted output is 3*8=24 bytes, meaning that the initial value is 16-23 bytes long. The DES has block-size of 8 bytes, meaning that 8 input bytes correspond to 8 output bytes, and ECB mode means that 8-byte blocks are independent. This and the fact that the outputs differ by only the second 8-byte block leads to conclusion that inputs differ by at least one byte in positions 8-16.""
The values added to their system (which were VIN numbers) were added with the letter O in them where the number 0 should have been used; interestingly, the letter ""O"" is an illegal character in VINs, which one would assume a company that manufactures cars would know!

Edit1: I already knew that DES isn't secure anymore but I need to use it in a web page just for learning purposes, also the way that C# code was written is completely right because I needed to follow some instructions and get that exactly result.
","DES is a deprecated encryption standard and you should not use it for anything else than learning purposes. AES would probably be the better choice if you're planning on using this to encrypt sensitive data.
Other than that since I haven't coded PHP in a while, but still wanted to contribute, I fixed up your existing C# code a little:
var plainText = ""1y7wpc4iddseyrwez1lor8ow3297t.pd0bfl"";
var password = ""rpsxi.t.rjsmklexarygfqyrrkhwdjh"";
var plainTextBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(plainText);

var des = new DESCryptoServiceProvider
{
    Mode = CipherMode.CBC, // don't use ECB as your CipherMode
    Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7,
    Key = passwordBytes
};

des.GenerateIV(); // work with a unique IV for each operation

string encrypted = null;
using (var desEncryptor = des.CreateEncryptor())
{
    var resultStream = new MemoryStream();
    using (var cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(resultStream, desEncryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write))
    {
        cryptoStream.Write(plainTextBytes, 0, plainTextBytes.Length);
    }

    encrypted = Convert.ToBase64String(resultStream.ToArray());
}

This is still not secure and as I said in the beginning, if security is critical for the application you're building you shouldn't use this. This answer is not supposed to make your code secure, just to point out some flaws in your usage of C# Streams and general coding guidelines.
For the PHP part this answer could work with the updated code I posted. You just have to extract the IV from the des object via des.IV and use it in your PHP script for the same functionality.
It's also worth noting that the used function mcrypt_encrypt is deprecated in newer versions of PHP, which brings me back to the first sentence of my answer: You should probably stop using DES altogether!

to
if(content.size()%8 != 0) content.append(8-(content.size()%8), 8-content.size()%8);

","You forgot to hex decode the key before using it. You're also using CBC mode instead of ECB mode, but as your IV is all zero's, that amounts to the same thing for the first block of data that is encrypted.

","strength - the size, in bits, of the keys we want to produce.
it is from javadoc for KeyGenerationParameters. The DESPArameters.DES_KEY_LENGTH stores value 8 (DES key length in bytes), but KeyGenerationParameters requires key length in bits. 8 bytes * 8 = 64 bits in a case of KeyGenerationParameters. You can just put the constant value 64.
This class can be used for random key generation for any algorythm, for example, to generate DES key you must use value of 64, to generate 3DES key 128 or 192.

","It is important to make sure that the last block in the stream is flushed. Block ciphers modes such as ECB mode and CBC mode need to be padded because a block cipher can only encrypt full blocks of plaintext. As the stream does not know that your serialized data object is the last data it has to encrypt, it cannot pad and encrypt the last block itself.
The FlushFinalBlock should be called after you have written the last plain text data to the CryptoStream. Alternatively you could call close() on the upper CryptoStream instead of the underlying stream, or make sure it is properly disposed before you call close() on the underlying stream.

http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/des/tripledesval.html
Actually, according to the above link no implementation has been validated yet as conforming to TOFB-I!
So I guess I'll need to implement my own TOFB-I algo.

","This problem occurs when external access (externalAccess) flag is false in the object but the corresponding object is called by a shareable interface.
For example (from your code): -

rw_cipherDes = Cipher.getInstance(Cipher.ALG_DES_CBC_NOPAD, false);

Here the external access flag is False i.e. you are instructing the Cipher API not to provide the access of cipher object to any external application (which is for the case of calling this API by shareable interface).
So, the following line will generate a security exception (hence SW 6F00) when called from across applications by shareable interface. 

return rw_cipherDes.doFinal(msg, (short) pos, len, encMsg, (short)
  encPos);}

Obviously,when you call the same API from its own application, then it will work fine.
Solution is allowing externalAccess (true) for the object. This would make it accessible via shareable interface.

rw_cipherDes = Cipher.getInstance(Cipher.ALG_DES_CBC_NOPAD, true);

EDIT:
What I mean by first and last is that the first bits are the Most significant bits and the last are the Least significant bits.
","As I understand the problem: You have an unexpected count of (set) bits!
Reason: Using Random, with the given bounds nextInt(60) and a repetition of 2 x 20 times, it is ""quite likely"" that you set (overwrite) your bits multiple times, which makes you missing (set) bits by the end.
A simple solution 'd be to repeat int next = nextInt(60); until !temp1.get(next) (temp2respectively):
    Random r = new Random();
    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        int next = r.nextInt(60);
        while (temp1.get(next)) { //bit already set, repeat:
            next = r.nextInt(60);
        }
        temp1.set(next);

        // temp2:
        next = r.nextInt(60);
        while (temp2.get(next)) {
            next = r.nextInt(60);
        }
        temp2.set(next);
    } // ensures you 20 bits set.


A finer solution, would be a data structure, which ensures you random & unique values...like: Creating random numbers with no duplicates
or this function (see : https://stackoverflow.com/a/54608445/592355):
static IntStream uniqueInts(int min, int max, int count, java.util.Random rnd) {
    // call Random.ints(min, max) with ... distinct and limit
    return rnd.ints(min, max).distinct().limit(count);
}

which you would use like:
final BitSet temp1 = new BitSet(20); // values lower than 64 (resp. 32?) lead to 64 (resp. 32!)
final BitSet temp2 = new BitSet(20);
final Random r = new Random();
unniqueInts(0, 60, 20, r).forEach(i - > {if(i % 8 > 0)temp1.set(i)});
unniqueInts(0, 60, 20, r).forEach(i - > {if(i % 8 > 0)temp2.set(i)});
//also better:
key1.or(temp1);
key2.or(temp2);

System.out.println(k1temp);
//the if (i % 8 == 0)  ..already done in forEach^^

I'm coding an implementation of DES and I'm manipulating 64bits strings rarely, 28bits and 24bits a bit more, and 48 bits strings a lot.
I've seen implementations using arrays of chars. So it takes exactly the right amount of memory.
But when it comes to bit operation, I found using uint64_t typedef simplifying everything. Eventhough it's too much most of the time.
What do you guys think? Should I keep using uint64_t and pad it with 0s most of the time?
","You definitely want to use uint64_t for everything for performance and simplicity. If you need to handle 48-bit overflow you'll have to handle that specially.

"42124390","exponential arrival and service rates","I have 2 agent types (say patients). each patient type will need a service after an exponential amount of time. 
We also have 2 different services A and B which have different service rates (exponential) for different patient types. 
So in total we have 4 different arrival rates and 4 different service rates.
How can I model this? How can I say that these 2 patient types are going to use those 2 servers since arrival and service rates are exponential? right now I am using probability in selectoutput but the results I get are not exact. When we have exponential arrival and service rates,
how can we say that the agents are going to use the senter image description hereervers? Is there a better way to model this? any help would be appreciated.
","What I could make up from the text and the model you showed is that you have 2 different patients which are also split in 2 different services which they need and that causes the 4 different delays. So patient 1 and 2 and service A or B cause 4 delays? If this is the case than I would make a parameter in the agent called serviceType which Amy Greer first stated and define this parameter at the exit of the first selectOutputs (or exit of delays is also possible). With the select output you can assign the patients to the right service which Amy already stated by using a condition statement.
Now if you want to use different processtimes in your services for the different patients, which consist of 2 different processtimes for service A and B (1&2 for A and 1&2 for B) there are multiple way to do this. Personally I would make a database in my model in which I specify the process times (exponential distributions in this case) and do the delay time in service A and B through a database reference. If you are not familiar with how to do this, I uploaded a screenshot to this link http://imgur.com/7x0xCUZ.

"47266693","Triple DES Java not working","I'm using this programs code Programs code full and i can't figure it out why wouldn't my Triple DES work. How and what did i try?

I added 3key inputs (as well arrays for keybits) that i would use to encrypt the hex and converted them:
    String keyy1 = new Scanner(System.in).nextLine();
    int keyBitstriple1[] = new int[64];
        for(int i=0 ; i < 14 ; i++) {
        String s = Integer.toBinaryString(Integer.parseInt(keyy1.charAt(i) + """", 16));
                while(s.length() < 4) {
                    s = ""0"" + s;
                }
                for(int j=0 ; j < 4 ; j++) {
                    keyBitstriple1[(4*i)+j] = Integer.parseInt(s.charAt(j) + """");
                }
            }    

Then i encrypted the hexa:
    System.out.println(""1st encrypt"");
    int outputBits[] = permute(inputBits, keyBitstriple1, false);
    int outputBits2[] = Arrays.copyOf(outputBits, outputBits.length);
    System.out.println(""-----------------------------------------------------------"");
    System.out.println(""2nd enrypt"");
    int outputBits3[] = permute(outputBits2, keyBitstriple2, false);
    int outputBits4[] = Arrays.copyOf(outputBits3, outputBits3.length);
    System.out.println(""-----------------------------------------------------------"");
    System.out.println(""3rd enrypt"");
    int outputBits5[] = permute(outputBits4, keyBitstriple3, false);
 );
 int outputBits6[] = Arrays.copyOf(outputBits5, outputBits5.length); 
//a copy of end encrypt


Encryption is completely correct, even when i check with online DES encryption software results was the same.

Then i saved the end encryption in outputBits6 and made a user enter 3 more keys to what decrypt that encrypted text. The same as first step.
 String keyy4 = new Scanner(System.in).nextLine();
 String keyy5 = new Scanner(System.in).nextLine();
 String keyy6 = new Scanner(System.in).nextLine();

Then i took first user entered key to decrypt the hexa text. (outputbits6)
    System.out.println(""-----------------------------------------------------------"");
    System.out.println(""First decrypt"");
    int outputBits7[] =  permute(outputBits6, keyBitstriple4, true);
    System.out.println(""-----------------------------------------------------------"");
    System.out.println(""2nd decrypt"");
    int outputBits8[] = permute(outputBits7, keyBitstriple5, true);
    System.out.println(""-----------------------------------------------------------"");
    System.out.println(""3rd decrypt"");
    int outputBits9[] = permute(outputBits8, keyBitstriple6, true);

","One thing that is missing is that generally 3DES encryption is ede: encrypt with the 1st key, decrypt with the 2nd key and encrypt with the 3rd key. The reverse ded for decryption.

My Encryption/Decryption methods take byte arrays as arguments. I used DES as per program specifications. I was population the byte arrays like this 
//were mk is a string
byte[] mkBytes = System.Text.UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(mk); 

However CreateDecryptor method was giving ""Specified key is not a valid size for this algorithm"" error. 
Therefore to go around the problem I was forced to do this, hard code the whole bit array and worked fine.
byte[] masterKey_bytearr = { 0x12, 0x22, 0x22, 0x22, 0x22, 0x22, 0x22, 0x23 };

But now I face the problem again since the user will be inputting the string in a textbox and cannot hard code them myself.  How can I get the string from textbox and assign it to a byte[] suitable for DES CreateDecryptor method?

","To expand on Jean-Bernard's answer:
String concatenation is done like this in Java:
String s1 = ""hello"";
String s2 = ""world"";
String s3 = s1+"" ""+s2; // ""hello world""

Therefore what you want to do is concatenate all of the strings (with a loop) before you show the dialog box.
Which you would do like this:
String collection = """";
for(int i  = 0; i < cihpertext.length; i++) {
    collection += "" ""+ciphertext[i];
    if(chkEight(i)) [
        collection += ""\n""
    }
}
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, collection);

EDIT: To clarify what your mistake is:
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,""\n\nCiphertext: "");
for (int i = 0; i < ciphertext.length; i++) {

    if (chkEight(i)) {
        System.out.print(""\n"");
    }
    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,ciphertext[i] + "" "");
}

In this code you:

Try to print a newline to the terminal if chkEight(i) returns true; this won't append anything to the string.
Then you call showMessageDialog for every iteration in the loop, showing the current ciphertext element plus a space.

Are you sure that you understand your own code?

So I read plain.txt 8 bytes and a 'keyandIV.bin' files. Than I took first 8 bytes from keyandIVbuffer as a KEY for DES and the rest as IV. So I have 8 bytes key and 8 bytes IV, added '\0'  at the end of both (Do I need '\0' here ? Key length must be 64 or 56 bits?).

Also, if something went wrong during an operation an error code should have been printed out to stderr.

"43371689","Include the trailing space in sprintf in MATLAB","I'm trying to implement the DES cipher in Matlab.
In order to have the bits for the plain text and key, I'm doing this:
binInput = hex2bin(sprintf('%x',input));

Where hex2bin is a function gave to us by the professor.
This gives me the hex for the input, then the binary of it as char array.
I noted that when input has a trailing space, it is ignored, hence my algorithm stops to work because the block is not 64 bit long anymore (i get a 1x15 char vector instead of a 1x16 for example).
How can I include this trailing space? I could not find anything online or in the help of sprintf.
Thanks in advance
","sprintf does respect all whitespace regardless of whether it's trailing, leading, or in-between.
sprintf('%x', 'hello')
%   68656c6c6f

sprintf('%x', 'hello ')
%   68656c6c6f20

If you need your input length to be a multiple of 64-bits, you'll likely want to pad your data with null bytes
str((end+1):(end+mod(numel(str), 8))) = '0';

If anything is getting truncated, it is likely an issue with the hex2bin function your professor gave you.

I just don't get it, is there something which I am missing or don't understand?
EDIT
I have added code to print out the byte array in string, it differs:

Java 
barray length: 8

","@JamesKPolk is correct: You're encrypting { (byte)'p', (byte)'e', (byte)'a', (byte)'n', (byte)'u', (byte)'t', (byte)'s', (byte)'\r', (byte)'\n' } in C#, and { (byte)'p', (byte)'e', (byte)'a', (byte)'n', (byte)'u', (byte)'t', (byte)'s' } in Java.
Since ""peanuts"" is (in UTF-8) 7 bytes, it can be PKCS7 padded into one DES block. The next 1-8 bytes results in a second block... and you added two.
Changing the code in the Dot.Net Fiddle to Write instead of WriteLine produces
Algorithm: DES?/CBC/PKCS7
BlockSize: 64
barray length: 8
barray: 45 100 170 103 9 249 237 180
barray: LWSqZwn57bQ=

where now the only difference is that C# BlockSize is bits, and your Java code has it as bytes.
Change ""peanuts"" to ""peanuts\r\n"" in your JDoodle and you get
Algorithm: DES/CBC/PKCS7Padding
BlockSize: 8
barray length: 16
barray:  107 125 91 -51 77 -50 98 120 -42 -62 64 -89 -128 97 -124 75
barray: a31bzU3OYnjWwkCngGGESw==

Which is the same, if the barray decimal contents had been printed as unsigned values instead of signed values (add 256 to all the negative numbers) -- a fact easily visible in the Base64 being the same.

There is one problem: String is for Unicode text, with two-byte chars (UTF-16).
This means any byte[] value must be text in some encoding, and with that encoding converted to a String. Any arbitrary byte[] value will not be a valid String. Especially on Linux with the preeminent UTF-8 encoding that will corrupt data.
The problem probably resides in decryptUTF8. If in the original code the default encoding is a single byte encoding, everything is swallowed as-is. For Linux, UTF-8, erroneous UTF-8 multi-byte sequences might be encountered. Or the encoding is a 7-bits ASCII.
In general keep String and byte[] apart; use byte[] for non-text binary data.

}

As written as comments in the code, I am not quite sure if I am using the correct cipher, maybe even the padding mode is incorrect and my iv has a length of 16 bytes but only 8 bytes are expected.
Also, I did try my luck already with or without hashing the key/iv.
Is it even possible to convert the above mentioned OpenSSL logic into plain C#? 
","Key and IV must be specified for openssl enc with -K and -iv as hexadecimal values. This is missing in the C# code, so that essentially the following expressions
tdes.Key = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(_key);
tdes.IV = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(_key.Substring(0, 16));

would have to be replaced by
tdes.Key = StringToByteArray(_key);
tdes.IV = StringToByteArray(_key.Substring(0, 16));

to produce the same ciphertext for useHashing == false. Here StringToByteArray is a method that converts a hexadecimal string into the corresponding byte array, e.g. here.
It should also be noted that .NET does not accept keys that are too weak, e.g.:
123456789012345612345678901234561234567890123456

In case of such a key a CryptographicException is thrown (Specified key is a known weak key for 'TripleDES' and cannot be used). OpenSSL accepts this key.
Regarding security:

MD5 shouldn't be used nowadays to generate a key, more here.
In addition, MD5 generates a 16 byte hash. Thus, always keying option 2 is used, which is weaker than keying option 1 (Keying options). 
Generally it's insecure to use the key as IV, more here.
TripleDES is slow compared to today's standard AES, more here.

        // TODO(directxman12): make genDES not require an Array

            Util.Warn(""Response "" + response);
        this._updateState(""SecurityResult"");

My understanding is that the client is asking sever to send challenge with code
this._sock.rQwait(""auth challenge"", 16)

Then server is sending a challenge which is being received by client in code
this._sock.rQshiftBytes(16)

Then the Password is DES encrypted using RFB.genDES and response ise sent over socket.
However on server side, which is a XVP proxy program, the code looks like
unsigned int major, minor, type, res, challenge[4], response[16];

...
        case XVP_STATE_CHALLENGE_AUTH:
        srandom((unsigned int)(time(NULL) ^ 0xdf214a30));
        for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            challenge[i] = (random() ^ 0x51a488ce);
        }
        if (!xvp_write_all(client_sock, challenge, sizeof(challenge)))
            return 1;
        xvp_proxy_state = XVP_STATE_RESPONSE_AUTH;
        xvp_proxy_writing = false;
        break;
    case XVP_STATE_RESPONSE_AUTH:
        if (!xvp_read_all(client_sock, response, 16))
            return 1;
        authok = (vm == xvp_multiplex_vm || wrongvm) ? false :
            xvp_password_vnc_ok(vm->password, client_ip,
                                (char *)challenge, (char *)response);
        xvp_proxy_state = XVP_STATE_CONFIRM_AUTH;
        xvp_proxy_writing = true;
        break;

The challenge array is only 4 byte and is being sent as it is using code
!xvp_write_all(client_sock, challenge, sizeof(challenge))

However my javascript log from following code shows array of 16 numbers.
Util.Warn(""Challenge "" + challenge);

e.g. Challenge 100,139,246,69,3,120,162,81,179,57,13,48,56,106,4,19
My question is whether java script is really reading 16 bytes from socket using this._sock.rQshiftBytes(16) and server is sending only 4 bytes on same socket ?

","A good idea to test your crypto against some other ""oracle"". But two issues apparent with your use of the online tool:

the key should be given as hex not text (the VB code has a byte array). Presumably 0102030405060708
3DES is the algorithm, but the VB code uses classic DES - there's a separate TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider for 3DES

However that site gives me the same encrypted text for both DES and 3DES, so it may not be a reliable oracle anyway? Try another, but may need to use a plain text key (first two I looked at didn't offer hex input in any obvious way)

"58645977","Encrypting and decrypting strings in Python, to match old VB.NET code","For quite a few years I've been running a VB.Net application, which used functions for encrypting and decrypting strings. These functions are gratefully taken from a WordPress blog which is now no longer available.
The problem now is that I am making a new Python-based version of the application, but we have databases full of strings that have been encrypted using the old VB.NET version, that I will need to be able to decrypt. So I need Python functions that will decrypt and encrypt to give exactly the same results!
In the old code, sending strText = ""Secret message."" and strEncrKey = ""Terribly"" to encryptString() would result in this encrypted, database-friendly string: dqCMClFoMs3B9AjoFGs+cQ== 
(This process could then be reversed with decryptString())
I'm still new to Python and a complete novice on anything to do with encryption or byte conversion, so I don't know how to replicate the equivalent of the 'createEncryptor' function from the VB.NET code.
Here's my Python code as it stands. It uses pyDes (import pydes) at the top of the code:
    defaultKey = ""Terribly""
    charset = ""utf-8""
    data = pyDes.des(defaultKey)
    print(""pyDes initialised."")
    text_to_encode = ""Secret message.""
    encrypted = data.encrypt(text_to_encode.encode(charset))
    print(""encrypted:"", repr(encrypted))
    decrypted = data.decrypt(encrypted).decode(charset)
    print(""decrypted:"", repr(decrypted))

but this code fails to run.
So my question is two-fold:

Why is my Python installation bombing out with an exit code -1073740791 error on the data.encrypt line? Am I messing up the syntax?
Is it possible to completely replicate the previous encryption and decryption, with matching results each time, and if so, how do I do it?

"58635098","PHP openssl_decrypt doesn't get same results as online tools","Using an online encrypt/decrypt tool, using DES-ECB, I can encrypt an 8 digit hexadecimal number using an 8 digit hexadecimal key, resulting in an 8 digit hex result. I can decrypt that 8 digit result by the same key and get the original data I encrypted.
However, I cannot reproduce this locally using PHP. The encrypted result I get online, it turns out, is the first 8 of 16 digits actually produced. No problem... But when I try to decrypt locally using PHP, I need all 16 digits in order to get the original data.
How can I decrypt with only the 8 digits and still get the original data, like the online tool does?
Online results:
Encrypting:
$data = '03 67 A6 7F C2 00 0A DB';
$key = '00 F2 83 CD BA 41 6F FF';
$result = '8b be 0f 3b ae 92 56 07';

Decrypting:
$data = '8b be 0f 3b ae 92 56 07';
$key = '00 F2 83 CD BA 41 6F FF';
$result = '03 67 A6 7F C2 00 0A DB';

Verify: http://des.online-domain-tools.com/link/1b40e05gD5TNgMb72h/
Local PHP test:
$enc = openssl_encrypt( hex2bin('0367A67FC2000ADB'), 'DES-ECB', hex2bin('00F283CDBA416FFF'), 1);

bin2hex($enc) results in 8bbe0f3bae9256071da486ee680f8449
If I decrypt only the first 8 hex digits, I don't get the same results I do with the online tool:
$dec = openssl_decrypt( hex2bin('8bbe0f3bae925607'), 'DES-ECB', hex2bin('00F283CDBA416FFF'), 1);

bin2hex($dec) results in null (or false if we do not convert to hex)
But if I enter the full 16 digit hex as the encrypted data, I get the correct result:
$dec = openssl_decrypt( hex2bin('8bbe0f3bae9256071da486ee680f8449'), 'DES-ECB', hex2bin('00F283CDBA416FFF'), 1);

bin2hex($dec) results in 0367A67FC2000ADB
This makes sense to me... but I need to be able to get this result from only the 8 digit hex, just like the online tool does. What do I need to do to make this possible?
","The reason for the difference is the padding. A block cipher only allows the encryption of data whose length corresponds to an integer multiple of the blocksize (8 bytes in the case of DES). Padding ensures that this condition is met by adding data according to a specific logic.
There are different types of padding. openssl_encrypt/openssl_decrypt uses PKCS7-padding by default, the online-tool Zero-padding. 
PKCS7-padding will always add data to the plaintext, even if the plaintext already has a length that is an integer multiple of the blocksize. In this case, a complete block is added (details). For this reason, the posted ciphertext generated with openssl_encrypt has a length of 2 blocks (16 bytes) for a plaintext with a length of 1 block (8 bytes).
Unlike PKCS7-padding, the Zero-padding variant used by the online-tool doesn't add any data if the plaintext already has a length that is a multiple of the blocksize.  For this reason, the posted ciphertext generated with the online-tool has a length of 1 block (8 bytes) for a plaintext with a length of 1 block (8 bytes).
openssl_encrypt/openssl_decrypt doesn't support Zero-padding. For the ciphertext of openssl_encrypt to match that of the online-tool, the PKCS7-padding must be disabled and the Zero-padding variant used by the online-tool must be implemented manually. The disabling of the padding is done with the flag OPENSSL_ZERO_PADDING, which must be set with the fourth parameter. Note: The name of the flag is misleading: This flag doesn't enable Zero-padding, but only disables PKCS7-padding. This means that the Zero-padding variant of the online-tool still has to be implemented manually. Furthermore: In the current code, the value 1 is passed in the fourth parameter, which corresponds to the flag OPENSSL_RAW_DATA. To set both flags, the value 1 must therefore be replaced by OPENSSL_RAW_DATA | OPENSSL_ZERO_PADDING.
For plaintexts whose length already corresponds to an integer multiple of the blocksize, both a disabled PKCS7-padding and the Zero-padding variant used by the online-tool don't add any additional data, so that the ciphertexts match. In this case, a manual implementation of the Zero-padding variant used by the online-tool isn't necessary.
A final note on security: DES is insecure. Today's standard is AES. ECB is also insecure. More secure modes are e.g. CBC or GCM.

"37773953","What is the data type to store user inputted bitwise operator","I have implemented Data Encryption Standard(DES) to encrypt a plain text and get the cipher from it. Though the DES uses 56 bit key , 64 bit block size and 16 rounds, to start from a simple code. I used 4 bit key, 8 bit block size, 4 rounds and without sub key generation (i.e. same key is used in all the rounds). According to DES for each an every round a round function is used. In my case I used the bitwise AND (&) operator.
Here is a portion of my code
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Encrypt {
    private int key[]={1,0,1,0};
    private int dataBlock[]={1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1};
    private int dataLeft[]=new int [4]; // for left part the plain text

    private int n=5;    // the no of rounds
    private int cipher[];

    public void splitting(){
        int j=0;        // for setting the indexes of the dataRight[]
        for(int i=0;i<dataBlock.length;i++){

            if (i<(dataBlock.length/2)){

                dataLeft[i]=dataBlock[i];

            }
            //           when i is greater than the half the index of the plain text
            else{

                dataRight[j]=dataBlock[i];
                j++;
            }
        }
        // for printing the array-------------------------------------------------  
        System.out.println(""DataSet"");
        for(int i: dataLeft){

        }
        for(int i: dataRight){
            System.out.print(i);
        }
        System.out.println("" "");
        System.out.println("" "");
        //------------------------------------------------------------------------
    }

    //==============================round function================================================

    public void roundingStart(){

        for(int i=0;i<4;i++){
            //           AND function
            dataRightTemp[i]=key[i] & dataRight[i];

        //      printResults();

        printFirst();
        roundingRest(dataLeft,dataRightTemp);


    }
//rest of the code
}

This works fine. But how do I change the above code so that user can enter the bitwise operator that is to be used in the round function. I tried using Scanner but I don't know what data type to be used to store the user input as bitwise operator so that it can be used at line
dataRightTemp[i]=key[i] & dataRight[i];

Can someone explain me how to do this?
","you cannot store the operator itself.
instead let the user input the operator as text: e.g. and, or , ..
and in your code use an if-statement to use the correct operator based on this user-text. Pseudocode:
if (""and"".equalsIgnoreCase(userInput) {
     dataRightTemp[i]=key[i] & dataRight[i];
} else if (""or"".equalsIgnoreCase(userInput)) {
     dataRightTemp[i]=key[i] | dataRight[i];
}

"55092686","I need help understanding bit order in DES for a C implementation","I'm using a variety of references to study this algorithm, among others Christof Paar's book and classes. Currently I'm working on a custom C implementation of the algorithm, and am trying to implement the Expansion function in DES.
I am having problems with bit order. In an example provided in this link, the following data (A) gets expanded to (B):
(b<x>) --> byte <x>

   (b0) (b1) (b2) (b3)
A: 0xF0 0xAA 0xF0 0xAA

   (b0)                    (b5)
B: 0x7A 0x15 0x55 x7A 0x15 0x55

At a bit level, what's happening is:
A:   1111   0000   1010   1010
B:  011110 100001 010101 01010-

    0111 1010 0001 0101 0101...
    0x7  0xA  0x1  0x5  0x5...

Now, unless I'm missing something, I'd say that in byte 0xF0, or 0b11110000, the left-most bit (1) is being treated as bit 0, and the right-most bit (0), is being treated as bit 7.
This is, however, opposite to the bit order offered by C. In C, bit 0 is the right-most, and bit 7 is the left-most. The expansion of this byte would look like:
 0000   1111
100001 01111...

Am I missing something? What bit order - endianness should I be considering in this algorithm?

I have a Buffer of data structured like this:
[39 bytes of header] + [body] + [padding] (calculated by me).
If I save it to a file, I can actually recognize the structure, and everything seems fine.
Then, I have to DES-CBC encrypt this buffer, and what I do is
a) Instantiate the DES wrapper, which has a key, and calculates a new IV (autoPadding: false on the Cipher object it creates, too)
b) Pass the buffer to the DES wrapper
c) The buffer then gets encrypted as follows:
(data is the buffer, en is the Cipher object)
var buf1 = en.update(data);

When I output buf1 on a file (and then, in my case, on a socket) and retrieve it's bytes, then decrypt it I obtain the following structure:
[header][body]
But when I output data on a file and retrieve it's bytes, I get the starting structure.
I know I should also append en.final() to buf1, but in my case I don't need those values, also with autoPadding being false it would just throw an error.
","The API provides you with a contract. One of the properties of the contract is that you need to call Cipher#final([output_encoding]) when you finished encrypting.

If the plain text that I want to encrypt contains strange charactes, as accents, fails. 
For example, my code is working fine when I try to encrypt the next word: 
Text to be encrypted(multiple of 8 in length) : ""Hello Jose      ""
However, it fails if I try to encrypt the same text but containing an accent:
Text to be encrypted (multiple of 8 in length)= ""Hello José      ""
The error that I am getting is “ValueError: Input strings must be a multiple of 8 in length”.
If I check the length of the word, it is a multiple of 8. 
plaintext=""Hello Jose      ""
print("" Plain text:"" + plaintext)
print("" Plain Text length:"" + str(len(plaintext)))

Result: Plain Text length : 16

from Crypto.Cipher import DES3
import binascii
import base64

plaintext=""Hello Jose      ""
print("" Plain text:"" + plaintext)
print("" Plain Text length:"" + str(len(plaintext)))

#### ENCRYPTION

key=bytes(key, 'utf-8')
plaintext_bytes=bytes(plaintext, 'utf-8')
print("" Plain Text length:"" + str(len(plaintext_bytes)))


cipher_encrypt=DES3.new(key)
encrypted_text=cipher_encrypt.encrypt(plaintext_bytes)
print( "" Encrypted word:"" + str(encrypted_text))

#### DECRYPTION
cipher_encrypt=DES3.new(key)
decrypted_text=cipher_encrypt.decrypt(encrypted_text)
print("" Decripted text:"" + str(decrypted_text,'utf-8') + ""\n"")

Can anyone help me to understand why it is not working correctly?
","Goyo is right. The algorithm reads the plain text as a byte-string. Knowing that, the length in bytes of one character with accent is 2. See next example: 
>> a='a'
>> print(""length:"" + str(len(a.encode('utf-8'))))
length:1

>> a='á'
>> print(""length:"" + str(len(a.encode('utf-8'))))
length:2

So, firstly you have to encode the text to bytes and then calculate the length. 
What you could do is calculate the next multiple of 8 and that should be the length of the plain text. After that, you could fill out the string with whitespace to that length.

After some debugging it looks like new String() and getBytes() are using default platform specific locales. Also UTF-8 in new String() changes encoded bytes (which are multiple of 8 bytes as per DES) to non multiple of 8 due to which decryption fails. Using base64 is not an option.

From my understanding, the Feistel cipher would decrypt a cipher text just by having the keys fed back to it in a backwards order, but this doesn't seem to be working. 
Do we have to reverse the keys or the order of Li,Ri as well. 
My Python Code:
def Encrypt (plainString):

l0=plainString[0:8]
r0=plainString[8:16]
l1=r0
fOutcome1=bitManage (r0,key[0:12])
r1=xorHelper (r0,fOutcome1)
l2=r1
fOutcome2=bitManage (r1,key[12:24])
r2=xorHelper (l1,fOutcome2)
rawCipherText= l2+r2
return rawCipherText

def desDecrypt (plainString):
l0=plainString[0:8]
r0=plainString[8:16]
l1=r0
fOutcome1=bitManage (r0,key[12:24])
r1=xorHelper (l0,fOutcome1)

l2=r1
fOutcome2=bitManage (r1,key[0:12])
r2=xorHelper (l1,fOutcome2)
rawCipherText= l2+r2
return rawCipherText

Here is the code for BitManage
Given the basic formula of the Feistel Cipher: 
Li = Ri−1
Ri = Li−1 ⊕ f(Ri−1, Ki).
I'm just doing two rounds of encryption.

I take in a string
Convert it to a numeric value (a=0...until 31)
Convert to bit strings
Encrypt 16 bit chunks of string.
Decrypt same chunks
Recombine the chunks (so you have one string) then break again into 5 bit strings to get character's numeric value and then convert back to letters.

So I should be able to just reverse the key schedule in f(Encrypt) for f(Decrypt) and get the correct answer but I'm getting gibberish back.
For more information: The key is a 24 bit round number, and,for the f function, the 8 bits of L0,R0 are passed through a separate program that expands them to 12 bits, XORs them with the relevant half of the roundkey and then passes them through S-boxes. I've checked the values of this f function and it seems to work perfectly. 
Is the problem the ""BitManage' function? The only place I can see the problem being caused is with the bit expansion (where I turn an 8 bit value into a 12 bit one by adding all the values at odd indexes to the end of the string) but I'm not sure why that would cause a problem.

","If it is a blank new card, AES is the the wrong cipher. The default cipher is 2K3DES, not AES. You must first change the cipher from the default to AES if you want to use it.

"41936915","TCL Tcllib DES wrong parameters?","I want to use the DES function from the Tcllib, but it seems I do not handle the
variables in a correct way.
Here is the code:
set key DAAE57F813459B3B
set key_b [binary format H* $key]

set data 2D7A99F520D684B4
set data_b [binary format H* $data]

set result [DES::des -dir encrypt -key $key_b -hex $data_b]

When using these values I got an error:
bad option ""-z..."": must be one of -chunksize, -dir, -hex, -in, -iv, -key, -mode, -out, -weak

It seems that the DES function is interpreting '2D...' as '-z...' and therefore as an option (which is not allowed).
When I exchange the values (key <-> data, data <-> key) I do not get an error.
Also when I use data 1D..., 3D... etc. the function works fine.
I am using Tcllib V1.18 and packages: des, sha1, pki, asn, aes, math::bignum, md5, base64.
Does anybody has an idea how to hand over the variable 'data' to the DES function without interpreting the data as option?
","The problem is that the high-level driver code in the DES::des command is confused by the data beginning with a - (0x2D) byte. That's a reportable bug; please report it.
But you can work around it by using the low-level interface in the Tcllib des package:
package require des

set key DAAE57F813459B3B
set key_b [binary format H* $key]

set data 2D7A99F520D684B4
set data_b [binary format H* $data]

# The [binary format] below is for the initialisation vector (IV) which should usually be
# 64 zero bits to start with if you're using simple encryption.
set d [DES::Init cbc $key_b [binary format I* {0 0}]]
set encBytes [DES::Encrypt $d $data_b]
DES::Final $d

# We've got the bytes out; let's convert to hex for printing

binary scan $encBytes H* encHex
puts $encHex;    # --> “4cd33892969591b4”

Going in the reverse direction is pretty easy too:
package require des

set key DAAE57F813459B3B
set key_b [binary format H* $key]

set encHex 4cd33892969591b4
set encBytes [binary format H* $encHex]

set d [DES::Init cbc $key_b [binary format I* {0 0}]]
set decBytes [DES::Decrypt $d $encBytes]
DES::Final $d

binary scan $decBytes H* decHex
puts $decHex;    # --> “2d7a99f520d684b4”

How many DES-keys will produce the same first 32 bit ciphertext from the same plaintext?

Since a block cipher is modeled as a pseudo-random permutation, the answer is 232.

If I get another plaintext-ciphertext pair, where I know the entire plaintext, but only the first half of the ciphertext. How many keys can produce the same first half of a ciphertext?

If the plaintext is longer than a block, then this depends on the mode of operation you're using and the specific length. 
If the plaintext is exactly one block and no padding is used, then it is the same answer as to your first question, because half a block are 32 bits for DES.

It is very strange that the encryption works partially. I was under the impression that you would either encryption would produce the whole original message intact, or it would yield an unreadable gibberish text. But never expected a mixture of the two.
What am I doing wrong?
*Edit: I have edited my question: I always read binary and write binary. The half decrypted output happens when I read/write binary. When I don't read binary, the output is completely gibberish.

"44310691","Encryption with DES with urlENcode(encrypt)","I am attempting to use DES to encrypt / decrypt. However, the decrypt is not working. I keep getting the error: Cannot read property 'charCodeAt' of null
The decryption is from http://www.tero.co.uk/des/
I am using this to encode: 
var decodedKey = decodeBase64(key);
var em = urlEncode(encrypt(decodedKey, value));

and then I am attempting to use this function to decrypt:
var emD = urlDecode(decrypt(decodedKey, em))

with 
 function encrypt(key, message) {
        var ciphertext = des(key, message, 1, 0, null, 1);
        var encodedCiphertext = encodeBase64(ciphertext);
        return encodedCiphertext;

       }

       function decrypt(key,message) {
         var ciphertext = des(key, message, 0, 1, null,1);
         var plainText = decodeBase64(ciphertext);
         return plainText;
       };

","With:
urlEncode(encrypt(decodedKey, value));

you first encrypt then url-encode. When you need to decrypt, you need to first url-decode then decrypt - something like: 
decrypt(decodedKey, urlDecode(em));

as opposed to decrypt then url-decode as you try with this statement: 
urlDecode(decrypt(decodedKey, em));

Also, please note that DES is considered insecure and should be avoided. Use a secure cipher like AES.

Problem now is that I imported tcllib, can make

Here is my code

}

private static String enc(String plainText, SecretKey key1, SecretKey key2) throws Exception{

    String encText = plainText;

my problem is that in the second loop (decryption with key2) I'm always getting this exception
