","SHA512 belongs to the SHA2 family of cryptographic hash functions. Since SHA1 has theoretical weaknesses and SHA512 is slightly slower than SHA1 (slower is better when hashing passwords), SHA512 (or any of the SHA2 family) should be chosen over SHA1 for the purpose of hashing passwords.
Actually understanding the differences in the functions is not going to be simple, but you might have a better chance of getting an answer on the Crypto SE site.

","Let us breakdown the word piece by piece:
PBKDF2--WithHmac--SHA512

Let's go over it part by part

PBKDF2
Stands for Password-based-Key-Derivative-Function, a successor of PBKDF1 and is used to implement a pseudorandom function, such as a cryptographic hash, cipher, or HMAC to the input password or passphrase along with a salt value and repeats the process many times to produce a derived key, which can then be used as a cryptographic key in subsequent operations.
HMAC
Stands for Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) is a specific construction for calculating a message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function in combination with a secret cryptographic key. Any cryptographic hash function,may be used in the calculation of an HMAC; the resulting MAC algorithm is termed HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA1 accordingly.
SHA512
Well, you know about it.. :P

Now, coming back to your question, the line of code:
SecretKeyFactory skf = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1"");

specifies the keyFactory to use the algorithm PDBKDF2WithHmacSHA1. When you would do something like:
SecretKeyFactory skf = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512"");

you tell the factory to use algorithm PBDKF2WithHmacSHA512.
Essentialy the main difference between PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 and PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512 is that:

The PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 will produce a hash length of 160 bits.
The PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512 will produce a hash length of 512 bits.

Hence the latter is more secure. But there are arguments on both sides as to which is sufficient for encryption. No debate. Just saying.
Some additional information about the two algorithms:

HMACSHA1

HMACSHA1 is a type of keyed hash algorithm that is constructed from the SHA1 hash function and used as an HMAC, or hash-based message
  authentication code. The HMAC process mixes a secret key with the
  message data, hashes the result with the hash function, mixes that
  hash value with the secret key again, and then applies the hash
  function a second time. The output hash is 160 bits in length.

HMACSHA512

HMACSHA512 is a type of keyed hash algorithm that is constructed from
  the SHA-512 hash function and used as a Hash-based Message
  Authentication Code (HMAC). The HMAC process mixes a secret key with
  the message data and hashes the result. The hash value is mixed with
  the secret key again, and then hashed a second time. The output hash
  is 512 bits in length.


The main advantage is that HmacWith512 is more secure than HmacWith256. For e.g.
HMAC_SHA1(""key"",""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"") = 0xde7c9b85b8b78aa6bc8a7a36f70a90701c9db4d9

HMAC_SHA512(""key"",""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"") = 0xb42af09057bac1e2d41708e48a902e09b5ff7f12ab428a4fe86653c73dd248fb82f948a549f7b791a5b41915ee4d1ec3935357e4e2317250d0372afa2ebeeb3a

The difference is pretty huge (as seen). Hope it helps. :)
EDIT: As OP mentions 
PBEKeySpec(char[] password, byte[] salt, int iterationCount, int keyLength)

The parameter keyLength is used to indicate the preference on key length
for variable-key-size ciphers. The actual key size depends on each provider's implementation. Hence say, doing something like
PBEKeySpec(password, salt, int 100, 512) doesn't mean you will be using SHA1 to generate a keyLength of 512. It simply means that. SHA1 supports upto a maximum of 160 bits. You cannot exceed that. 
As for your second question, have a look at the HMAC-SHA1. There are many statements that say algorithms like SHA256 is pretty good if you a long hash. 
Also, as per the NSA :

The NSA specifies that ""Elliptic Curve Public Key Cryptography using
  the 256-bit prime modulus elliptic curve as specified in FIPS-186-2
  and SHA-256 are appropriate for protecting classified information up
  to the SECRET level. Use of the 384-bit prime modulus elliptic curve
  and SHA-384 are necessary for the protection of TOP SECRET
  information.

I think using a HMAC function in conjunction SHA512 is quite secure.

I want to do this using the bouncy castle library but I don't know why I cannot get it to work by using the JCE interface...

 2. using the bouncy castle api directly 
 3. using the bouncy castle through JCE 
results in 2 distinct values: one common to the first two and one for the third.

PBEwithHmacSHA

Any ideas?
","In short, the reason for the difference is that PBKDF2 algorithm in modes #1 and #2 uses PKCS #5 v2 scheme 2 (PKCS5S2) for iterative key generation, but the BouncyCastle provider for ""PBEWITHHMACSHA1"" in mode #3 uses the PKCS #12 v1 (PKCS12) algorithm instead. These are completely different key-generation algorithms, so you get different results.
More detail on why this is so and why you get different sized results is explained below.
First, when you're constructing a JCE KeySpec, the keyLength parameter only expresses ""a preference"" to the provider what key size you want. From the API docs:

Note: this is used to indicate the preference on key length for variable-key-size ciphers. The actual key size depends on each provider's implementation.

The Bouncy Castle providers don't appear to respect this parameter, judging from the source of JCEPBEKey, so you should expect to get a 160-bit key back from any BC provider which uses SHA-1 when using the JCE API.
You can confirm this by programmatically accessing the getKeySize() method on the returned keybc variable in your test code:
Key keybc = factorybc.generateSecret(keyspecbc);
// ...
Method getKeySize = JCEPBEKey.class.getDeclaredMethod(""getKeySize"");
getKeySize.setAccessible(true);
System.out.println(getKeySize.invoke(keybc)); // prints '160'

Now, to understand what the ""PBEWITHHMACSHA1"" provider corresponds to, you can find the following in the source for BouncyCastleProvider:
put(""SecretKeyFactory.PBEWITHHMACSHA1"", 
    ""org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JCESecretKeyFactory$PBEWithSHA"");

And the implementation of JCESecretKeyFactory.PBEWithSHA looks like this:
public static class PBEWithSHA
    extends PBEKeyFactory
{
    public PBEWithSHA()
    {
        super(""PBEwithHmacSHA"", null, false, PKCS12, SHA1, 160, 0);
    }
}

You can see above that this key factory uses the PKCS #12 v1 (PKCS12) algorithm for iterative key generation. But the PBKDF2 algorithm that you want to use for password hashing uses PKCS #5 v2 scheme 2 (PKCS5S2) instead. This is why you're getting different results.
I had a quick look through the JCE providers registered in BouncyCastleProvider, but couldn't see any key generation algorithms that used PKCS5S2 at all, let alone one which also uses it with HMAC-SHA-1.
So I guess you're stuck with either using the Sun implementation (mode #1 above) and losing portability on other JVMs, or using the Bouncy Castle classes directly (mode #2 above) and requiring the BC library at runtime.
Either way, you should probably switch to 160-bit keys, so you aren't truncating the generated SHA-1 hash unnecessarily.

","You're good with PBKDF2, no need to jump to bcrypt.
Although, the recommendation to use 1000 iterations was made in year 2000, now you'd want much more.
Also, you should take more care when using bcrypt:

It is also worth noting that while bcrypt is stronger than PBKDF2 for most types of passwords, it falls behind for long passphrases; this results from bcrypt’s inability to use more than the ﬁrst 55 characters of a passphrase While our estimated costs and NIST’s .
  estimates of passphrase entropy suggest that bcrypt’s 55-character limitation is not
  likely to cause problems at the present time, implementors of systems which rely on
  bcrypt might be well-advised to either work around this limitation (e.g., by “prehashing” a passphrase to make it ﬁt into the 55-character limit) or to take steps to
  prevent users from placing too much password entropy in the 56th and subsequent
  characters (e.g., by asking users of a website to type their password into an input
  box which only has space for 55 characters).

That said, there's also scrypt.

Website result: 
The derived 40-bit key is: a5caf6a0d3 

","First, let's look at an official test vector for PBKDF2 HMAC-SHA1:
Input:
   P = ""password"" (8 octets)
   S = ""salt"" (4 octets)
   c = 1
   dkLen = 20

 Output:
   DK = 0c 60 c8 0f 96 1f 0e 71
        f3 a9 b5 24 af 60 12 06
        2f e0 37 a6             (20 octets)

So now we know what we're shooting for both on the web and in your program.  So using that info, we find out that the web site wants your salt as an ASCII string, which it will then convert to bytes.  This is important because you'll never be able to match the web page's output if you use RAND_bytes to generate a salt.
password
salt
1
20
0c60c80f961f0e71f3a9b524af6012062fe037a6

And you are using the salt incorrectly.  In your commented line, you're generating a string with ASCII characters.  If you want to use that salt, you'd have to declare it as an array of bytes.  Plus, you're missing a digit.
unsigned char salt_value[]= { 0x5d, 0x85, 0x94, 0x7b, … /* and so on */ };

And in the uncommented code, you're generating an array of bytes but treating it as a string.  You don't call strlen on an array of bytes because arrays of bytes can contain 0, which strlen will interpret as a null terminator.  So you either track the size manually (e.g., your KEK_KEY_LEN define for the array you malloc) or you use sizeof when appropriate.
PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC_SHA1(pwd, strlen(pwd), salt_value, sizeof(salt_value), ITERATION, KEK_KEY_LEN, out);

So now that we know all these things, we can put together a full program that matches the output of both the web site and the official test vector.

","I get matching results when comparing key-derivation from .NET's Rfc2898DeriveBytes and Anandam's PBKDF2 Javascript implementation.  
I put together an example of packaging SlowAES and Anandam's PBKDF2 into Windows Script Components. Using this implementation shows good interop with the .NET RijndaelManaged class and the Rfc2898DeriveBytes class. 
See also:  

AES in Javascript
Getting SlowAES and RijndaelManaged to play together

All of these go further than what you are asking for.  They all show interop of the AES encryption.  But to get interop on encryption, it is a necessary pre-requisite to have interop (or matching outputs) on the password-based key derivation.

Now, the one limitation I have using Rfc2898DeriveBytes is the ""salt"" must be 8 octets long.  If it is shorter, the Rfc2898DeriveBytes throws an exception.  I was thinking all I had to do was pad the salt (if it was shorter) to 8 bytes, and I'd be good.  But NO!  I've tried pretty much every combination of padding with a shorter salt, but I cannot duplicate the results I get from those two websites above.
So bottom line is, does this mean the Rfc2898DeriveBytes just simply won't work with a source salt shorter than 8 bytes?  If so, does anyone know of any C# code I could use that implements PBKDF2 for WPA Preshared key?
","Looking at the Microsoft link, I made some changes in order to make the PMK the same as those discovered in the links you put forward.
Change the SHA algorithm from SHA256Managed to SHA1Managed for the inner and outer hash.
Change HASH_SIZE_IN_BYTES to equal 20 rather than 34.  
This produces the correct WPA key.
I know it's a bit late coming, but I've only just started looking for this sort of informatin and thought I could help others out.  If anyone does read this post, any ideas on the PRF function and how to do it within C#?

"1046599","PBKDF2 implementation in C# with Rfc2898DeriveBytes","Guys, I'm trying to implement a PBKDF2 function in C# that creates a WPA Shared key.  I've found some here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163913.aspx that seems to produce a valid result, but it's one byte too short... and the wrong PSK value.
To test the output, I am comparing it to this: http://www.xs4all.nl/~rjoris/wpapsk.html or http://anandam.name/pbkdf2/
I did find one way of getting this to work with a built in library to C# called Rfc2898DeriveBytes.  Using this, I get a valid output using:
Rfc2898DeriveBytes k3 = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(pwd1, salt1, 4096);

","This expands on Dodgyrabbit's answer and his code helped to fix mine as I developed this.  This generic class can use any HMAC-derived class in C#.  This is .NET 4 because of the parameters with default values, but if those were changed then this should work down to .NET 2, but I haven't tested that.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

"1149611","Getting SlowAES and RijndaelManaged class in .NET to play together","I'm trying to setup AES encryption / decryption using the javascript library SlowAES and the RijndaelManaged class in .NET.
I chose this method after reading this post, where Cheeso has managed to get these two encryption methods to play together  

""In my tests of the
  COM-wrapped-SlowAEs, I used CBC mode,
  and the encryption was completely
  compatible with the RijndaelManaged
  class in .NET"" - Cheeso

I've taken the javascript code from Cheeso's Windows Scripting Component, the latest slowaes libraries, and using the following javascript script to test:
var key = ""12345678901234567890123456789012"";
var message = ""watson?"";
var decrypted;

slowAES.aes.keySize.SIZE_256;
slowAES.modeOfOperation.CBC;
put_PassPhrase(key);
var result = EncryptString(message);
decrypted = DecryptCommaDelimitedStringToString(result)
document.write(""Key:"" + key + ""<br />original:"" + message + ""<br />Cypher:"" + result + ""<br />Decrypted:"" + decrypted + ""<br />IV(): "" + get_IV());

I'm getting the following output:
Key:12345678901234567890123456789012
original:watson?
Cypher:245,159,1,1,168,1,1,143,1,1,146,1,1,239,117,1
Decrypted:watson? 
IV(): 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've modified the following example found on MSDN to try and match the encryption in C# :
public static void Main()
        {
            try
            {
                string original = ""watson?"";
                byte[] IV = new byte[16];   // match slowaes IV
                byte[] key = new System.Text.ASCIIEncoding().GetBytes(""12345678901234567890123456789012"");// match slowaes KEY

                RijndaelManaged myRijndael = new RijndaelManaged();
                myRijndael.BlockSize = 128;
                myRijndael.KeySize = 256;
                myRijndael.Mode = CipherMode.CBC;

                // Encrypt the string to an array of bytes.
                byte[] encrypted = encryptStringToBytes_AES(original, key, IV);

                // Decrypt the bytes to a string.
                string roundtrip = decryptStringFromBytes_AES(encrypted, key, IV);

                //Display the original data and the decrypted data.
                Console.WriteLine(""Original:   {0}"", original);
                Console.WriteLine(""Round Trip: {0}"", roundtrip);

            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(""Error: {0}"", e.Message);
            }
        }

Watch of the byte array:
-  encrypted {byte[16]} byte[]
  [0] 139 byte
  [1] 104 byte
  [2] 166 byte
  [3] 35 byte
  [4] 8 byte

  [11] 143 byte
  [12] 105 byte
  [13] 3 byte
  [14] 24 byte
  [15] 255 byte

I've tried all the padding options with the managed .NET class, however I can't get the encrypted outputs to match. Can anyone help me?

}

compile the above with 
csc.exe /target:exe /out:Bob.exe Bob.cs

I use the slowAES.wsc from the other post you referenced, with 2 changes: I do not call getPaddedBlock() for the key in the EncryptString or DecryptString() methods. This really needs a PBKDF but let's not worry about that now. Here's what the modified EncryptString looks like: 
function EncryptString(plainText)
{
  // this is really wrong - need a PBBKDF to get the key, instead
  // of just using the passphrase
  var key = cryptoHelpers.convertStringToByteArray(_passphrase);
  // var nkey = slowAES.getPaddedBlock(key, 0, _keysize, _mode);
  var bytesToEncrypt = cryptoHelpers.convertStringToByteArray(plainText);

  var result = slowAES.encrypt(bytesToEncrypt, 
      _mode,
      key,
      _keysize,
      _iv);
  return result['cipher'];
}

This means you have to use a passPhrase that is exactly the length required by the keysize.  If you use AES256, then pass a 32-char string (32 * 8 = 256 bits).  Seems like you figured this out already. 
The client of the WSC component is also Javascript (though it can be any COM language).  Here's what I used.
function toHexString(a)
{
    var ret = '';
    for(var i = 0;i < a.length;i++)
        ret += (a[i] < 16 ? '0' : '') + a[i].toString(16) + ' ';
    return ret.toLowerCase();
}


//var plaintext = ""Hello. This is a test. of the emergency broadcasting system."";
var plaintext = ""watson?"";

try
{
    WScript.echo( ""plaintext: "" + plaintext);
    WScript.echo( ""plaintext.length: "" + plaintext.length);

    WScript.echo( ""instantiate "");
    var aes = new ActiveXObject(""Ionic.Com.SlowAES"");

    WScript.echo( ""keysize "");

    WScript.echo(e.Message);
}

If I then run this code, the Javascript and C# produces the same cipher text for a plaintext of ""watson?"", using AES256, passphrase of 12345678901234567890123456789012, and an IV of 16 bytes of zero.  The ciphertext generated is: 
8B 68 A6 23 08 2A D8 A0 EB 99 17 8F 69 03 18 FF

It successfully decrypts in both cases. 
EDIT: Though I packaged the slowAES encryption in a WSC, it will be interoperable running outside the COM environment as well. The WSC part is unnecessary for this question, but was necessary to demonstrate the answer for a prior question, which  was, ""how can I get VBScript and .NET AES to interoperate?""
EDIT2:  The source code that demonstrates AES interop between Javascript or VBScript and .NET is available.  I extended the basic example given here to produce test apps in 3 languages: C#, Javascript and VBScript.  They all take the same set of arguments.  They each use a RFC2898-compliant key derivation function.  You can specify the password, salt, IV, and plaintext, as well as the number of RFC2898 iterations to use in the PBKDF2.  You can easily verify that the ciphertext is the same for each of these test programs. Maybe the example will be useful for someone.

","There is a writeup over at agilebits from February that does the napkin calculations.  The abridged version:

As a ball park figure, I'm going to say 10,000 PBKDF2 iterations leads
  to tens of or hundred of milliseconds to test a password for a very
  high-end consumer system. What we are doing with PBKDF2 is reducing
  things from a million tests per second to a few hundred. This is
  taking into account specialized software that makes use of multiple
  cores and multiple GPUs.

So taking your erratasec article that benchmarks 430 million SHA-1 hashes per second on a gpu as a baseline - the agilebits article shows metrics that suggest PBKDF2 with 10k iterations would bring that down to around 100k tests per second.
Far from scientific, but gets us in the ballpark...

Does anyone have any rough/back-of-the-envelope/ballpark figures for how fast one could brute force PBKDF2?
","PBKDF2 is tunable.  You can always increase the cost value to reduce the number of possible guesses/sec for an attacker.  My recommendation is to decide how fast you want it to run on your platform and set the cost value accordingly.  For example, If you think 200 hashes/sec is an ideal tradeoff in performance/security, then increase the cost value and test how long it takes to hash a few thousand test passwords until you are averaging about 200/sec.
PBKDF2 also uses a ""salt"" which prevents attacks from scaling by forcing the attacker to separately attack each individual account.  Combined with stretching (i.e. slowing down the algorithm), this makes it extremely difficult to recover more than a small number of accounts.  An attacker can focus on one account and hope for the best or dedicate a set amount of time (an hour, a day) for each account and then move to the next one if he isn't successful.  
With the LinkedIn hashes, people were able to crack more than a million hashes in a day or less.  With PBKDF2 running at ~200 guesses/sec, it would take about 9 hours just to find out which of the 6.5M accounts used ""linkedin"" as their password.  If you wanted to run a list of 1,000 common passwords against all of those hashes, it would take about a year.

","Remember that bcrypt, scrypt, and PBKDF2/PKCS#5/RFC 2898 all support varying numbers of iterations; none is innately ""faster"" or ""slower"". Some take more RAM (PBKDF2 does not take much RAM), but that's about it.
As far as PBKDF2 iterations in specific, one popular GPU based cracking program can handle with a kitted out modern desktop + 8 GPU's at 1 million tries a second against WPA2.  As WPA2 is essentially PBKDF2(HMAC−SHA1, passphrase, ssid, 4096, 256), that tells us that one machine can test somewhat over 4 billion HMAC-SHA1 PBKDF2 iterations per second.  Ten such machines, of course, would test over 40 billion such iterations per second.
OWASP Password Cheat Sheet (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet) recommends at least 64,000 iterations in 2012, doubling every two years, or 90,510 iterations in 2013.

","Specialised hardware, such as used in bitcoin mining, can perform upwards of 50 billion hashes per second (as of early 2013. It's a moving target as hardware gets faster).
If you do 1,000 iterations of PBKDF2 then that will cut the attack down from 50 billion per second to 50 million per second. 10,000 iterations will be 5 million per second.
A typical web server however will not be anywhere near that fast. It's going to be a lot slower for you. You need to do some testing on your own production server and may find 10,000 iterations is too slow.
So it's not really about how fast PBKDF2 can be brute forced, it's about fast your server can verify a PBKDF2 password. You need to decide how long you think it should take (half a second? a tenth of a second? a hundredth of a second?) and then adjust the number of PBKDF2 rounds to suit that.
Also consider the strength of the passwords used by your customers. If they all have excellent passwords, then it really doesn't matter what hashing system you use. If they are all using terrible passwords then PBKDF2 is not good enough to protect them - you would need to get more exotic such as the hardware salted hash Apple uses in the iPhone to try and turn a 4 digit number into something that has at least some security (basically they force all hashing to be performed by a dedicated hardware chip, which is deliberately slow. move the data to any other hardware and it is impossible to decrypt).
Assuming the password is not in a dictionary (most passwords are), then the password strength is calculated by multiplying the number of possible characters in the alphabet by itself one hibe for each character. So if a password has letters (26 character alphabet) and digits (another 10 characters) then you have a 36 character alphabet, and if it's 6 characters long you multiply it by itself 6 times.
So a 6 digit alphanumeric password is 36*36*36*36*36*36, or if you prefer: 36^6. That gives you about 2.1 billion possible passwords... generally we assume the hacker will find the real password about half way through, so call it 1 billion.
If you are using PBKDF2 and have 1,000 iterations, then a hacker with specialised hardware will guess 1 billion passwords in about 20 seconds. That's not very good security at all.
You can improve security by either using more rounds of PBKDF2 (which will slow your website down) or by convincing your users to have better passwords. Simply by switching to 7 digits instead of 6, or by adding upper-case letters or even symbols, they will dramatically improve their security.
Wolfram Alpha is useful for doing the math: ((36 ^ 6) / 50 million) seconds where 36 is the size of the alphabet and 6 is the length of the password, and 50 million is the number of guesses per second a hacker can use (50 million is a serious attacker going after PBKDF2 with 1,000 rounds).
How many passwords are there in your database? If it takes 20 seconds to crack individual password, will that me 30 days of math or 30 years? It depends how many customers you have.

"2465690","PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1","To generate a valid pairwise master key for a WPA2 network a router uses the PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1 algorithm.  I understand that the sha1 function is performed 4096 times to derive the PMK, however I have two questions about the process.
Excuse the pseudo code.
1) How is the input to the first instance of the SHA1 function formatted?
SHA1(""network_name""+""network_name_length""+""network_password"")
Is it formatted in that order, is it the hex value of the network name, length and password or straight ASCII?
Then from what I gather the 160 bit digest received is fed straight into another round of hashing without any additional salting.  Like this: SHA1(""160bit digest from last round of hashing"") Rise and repeat.
2) Once this occurs 4096 times 256 bits of the output is used as the pairwise master key.  What I don't understand is that if SHA1 produces 160bit output, how does the algorithm arrive at the 256bits required for a key?
Thanks for the help.
","yeah thats right, the algorithm to generate a binary key for a WPA network is:
key = PBKDF2(passphrase, ssid, 4096, 256)
PBKDF2 is described in http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2898.txt
It uses the HMAC algorithm to create a digest of the input. HMAC can use any hash function, here the spec calls for SHA1 as you mentioned. The hash is done on an intermediate state within the HMAC algorithm:
H(K XOR opad, H(K XOR ipad, text))

(H=the chosen hash function, K is the passphrase, text would be ssid)
This HMAC process is repeated 4096 times by PBKDF2.
HMAC algorithm: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2104
There's a source example here of deriving a key:
https://www.codeblog.org/viewsrc/openssl-engine-0.9.6a/crypto/evp/p5_crpt2.c
int PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC_SHA1(const char *pass, int passlen,

For the randomBytes call (creating the SALT) what size should I use? I have heard 128-bit salts, maybe up to 256-bit. It looks like this function uses a size in bytes so can I assume a size of 32 (256 bits) is sufficient?
For the pbkdf2 call, what is a good number of iterations and what is a good length for the key (keylen)?
Also, for storage I have seen examples of storing the salt, length, iterations and derviedkey in the same column. I am using an example which separates the 4 by ::, i.e.:
salt::derivedKey::keyLength::iterations

Doing this, I can then separate on :: to get the 4 values, so I can generate a derived key based on a provided password to see if it matches. Is this the correct way to store this? Or should I be a little more ""deceptive"" in combining these values?
","1. Random bytes size: 
Salts should be at least the same size as your hash function, so for sha256 you should use at least 32 bytes. Node.js Crypto's pbkdf2 uses SHA1, so 20 bytes should be the minimum. However, the least you should use is 64 bits (8 bytes), as explained in #3. (Source: https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm).
2. PBKDF2 number of iterations: 
See this question for a great discussion. I took from it that 10.000 range is sufficient without impact performance, but this is hardware/performance dependant.
3. PBKDF2 length:
See this other discussion about key lengths. The parameter is again the hashing function used, in your case SHA-1, so 20 bytes is the correct value. Since PBKDF2's Standard recommends salts of at least 64 bits, it's a waste to generate keys smaller than your input, so use at least 8 bytes. Do not use output length of greater than 20, as it provides no additional security, but doubles computation time for each multiple of 20.
4. How to store variables:
Discussed in all the links above (especially the first), salts should be saved along passwords (but never reused elsewhere), usually by appending it first in the resulting string (salt:hash), or in another database column. 
As far as other variables, their knowledge is not critical for breaching security (as stated in Kerckhoffs's Principle, so you could parametrize it safely anywhere. Your way of doing it by separating them with ""::"" is fine, but you are saving extra information. Crackstation's codes only save ""algorithm:iterations:salt:hash"", so in your case, ""salt::derivedKey::iterations"" is all you need.

"11734495","How to properly store a PBKDF2 password hash","I have been doing some research for proper ways to hash/encrypt a password and store it in a database. I knew about Salt and Hashing so I looked around and PBKDF2 seemed to be a good choice. So I've found this website that gave a good tutorial on it as well as an adaptation of PBKDF2 for PHP (which is what I am using for my website). 
So I've set up my website to use these functions to generate/create passwords, but as you can see in the following code:

function create_hash($password) {
// format: algorithm:iterations:salt:hash
$salt = base64_encode(mcrypt_create_iv(PBKDF2_SALT_BYTES, MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM));
return PBKDF2_HASH_ALGORITHM . "":"" . PBKDF2_ITERATIONS . "":"" .  $salt . "":"" .
    base64_encode(pbkdf2(

        $salt,
        PBKDF2_ITERATIONS,
        PBKDF2_HASH_BYTES,
        true
    )); }


The salt is generated in the create_hash function, and is stored in the resulting hash which ends up looking like sha256:1000:salt:hashed_password. This is what I had to store in my database, and since the salt was included in the resulting hash, I didn't need to add it to my database. However, after generating a few test users with this, I wondered if having the PBKDF2 settings inside my hashed password in the database was actually a good thing. They way my newbie self see it is a hacker, after cracking my database, would see these bunch of sha256:1000:salt:password things, and figure out what each part would stand for, which would help him greatly in his attempts, no?
So I modified it a bit to have an external salt that I generate and store in my database, and include the salt in the password before running it through PBKDF2. I then do the same thing to compare the given password with what I have in my database for the login, and it works. My only concern is that a with 128bit salt, the resulting password hash is barely 50 characters long, that doesn't seem right to me.

Is my concern for that format of password saving makes sense? Or will it just amount to the same thing anyway, since by having my salt in my database, once it's cracked, the hacker can still brute-force his way through?
Thanks, and sorry for the long question.
","
My only concern is that a with 128bit salt, the resulting password
  hash is barely 50 characters long, that doesn't seem right to me.

The size of the resulting hash is completely unrelated to the size of the salt, the password, and the number of iterations.  The output of a modern secure hash algorithm (like sha256) is always the same length regardless of the input.  A zero length input has the same length output as a 25TB input.

Or will it just amount to the same thing anyway, since by having my
  salt in my database, once it's cracked, the hacker can still
  brute-force his way through?

By separating the salt into two pieces, you cost yourself increased code complexity (generally a bad thing).  Depending on how you store the salt pieces, you may gain a little benefit under some circumstances.  As an example, if the static salt fragment is stored outside of the database, then a dump of the database will not give an attacker enough information to perform an offline attack on the password hashes in the database.
The gain if the salt fragments are stored separately from one-another is a small amount of defence in depth.  Whether it outweighs the complexity cost is a judgement call, but I'd say the chances are good that the time would be better spent looking for XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities (the way that attackers often get the database dumps mentioned above), and securing connections between the various components of your system with SSL and certificates or strong passwords.

So I've found this website that gave a good tutorial on it as well as an adaptation of PBKDF2 for PHP (which is what I am using for my website). 
So I've set up my website to use these functions to generate/create passwords, but as you can see in the following code:

However, after generating a few test users with this, I wondered if having the PBKDF2 settings inside my hashed password in the database was actually a good thing. They way my newbie self see it is a hacker, after cracking my database, would see these bunch of sha256:1000:salt:password things, and figure out what each part would stand for, which would help him greatly in his attempts, no?
So I modified it a bit to have an external salt that I generate and store in my database, and include the salt in the password before running it through PBKDF2.

","A couple of things, one, instead of SHA256, you should be using a slow hashing function such as bcrypt, two, you should probably not be storing passwords at all (instead use openId or something similar).
All of that said, you need a different salt for each user, you can store them in the same row or even (as you are doing) the same field, or in an entirely different db.  How much effort you're willing to go to is really up to you and your performance requirements.
In addition to the individual salt for each user/password, you might also consider a per application salt, which is kept out of the any database.

","Answering my own question with a comment from @Romain.

See these answers for a good understanding of how useless hiding a
  salt is here, using bcrypt (since in your link no implementation
  is given) here, and best practices on how to use hash to secure
  passwords here. Finally, never underestimate your opponent!

Also, (since this is a bit old), bcrypt is indeed ""better"" than pbkdf2, but scrypt is even better!

Since PBKDF2 is really a key derivation function, it doesn't make sense for it to specify a way to bundle the ""hash"" (which is the really a derived key) together with the derivation parameters—in normal usage, the key must remain secret, and is never stored. 
But for usage as a one-way password hash, the hash can be stored in a record with the parameters, but in its own field.

","I'll join you in the fight against weak hashes.
OWASP has a Password Storage Cheat Sheet (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet) with some guidance; they recommend 64,000 PBKDF2  iterations minimum as of 2012, doubling every two years (i.e. 90,510 in 2012).
Note that a storing a long, cryptographically random salt per-userid is always basic.
Note that having a widely variable per-userid number of iterations and storing the number of iterations along with the salt will add some complexity to cracking software, and may help preclude certain optimizations.  For instance, ""bob"" gets encrypted with 135817 iterations, while ""alice"" uses 95,121 iterations, i.e. perhaps a minimum of(90510 + RAND(90510)) for 2013.
Note also that all of this is useless if users are allowed to choose weak passwords like ""password"", ""Password1!"", ""P@$$w0rd"", and ""P@$$w0rd123"", all of which will be found by rules based dictionary attacks very quickly indeed (the latter is simply ""password"" with the following rules: uppercase first letter, 1337-speak, add a three digit number to the end).  Take a basic dictionary list (phpbb, for a good, small starter wordlist) and apply rules like this to it, and you'll crack a great many passwords where people try ""clever"" tricks.
Therefore, when checking new passwords, don't just apply ""All four of upper, lower, number, digit, at least 11 characters long"", since ""P@$$w0rd123"" complies with this seemingly very tough rule. Instead, use that basic dictionary list and see if basic rules would crack it (it's a lot simpler than actually trying a crack - you can lower-case your list and their word, and then simply write code like ""if the last 4 characters are a common year, check all but the last four characters against the wordlist"", and ""if the last 3 characters are digits, check all but the last 3 characters against the wordlist"" and ""check all but the last two characters against the wordlist"" and ""De-1337 the password - turn @'s into a, 3 into e, and so on, and then check it against the wordlist and try those other rules too.""
As far as passphrases go, in general are a great idea, particularly if some other characters are added to the middle of words, but if and only if they're long enough, since you're giving up a lot of possible combinations.
Note that modern machines with GPU's are up to the tens of billions of hash iterations (MD5, SHA1, SHA-256, SHA-512, etc.) per second, even in 2012. As far as word combination ""correct horse battery staple"" type passwords, this one is at best a very modest password- it's only 4 all lower case English words of length 7 or less with spaces. So, if we go looking for XKCD style passwords with an 18 billion guess a second setup: A modern small american english dictionary has: 6k words of length 5 or less 21k words of length 7 or less 36k words of length 9 or less 46k words of length 11 or less 49k words of length 13 or less
With an XKCD style passphrase, and without bothering to filter words by popularity (""correct"" vs. ""chair's"" vs. ""dumpier"" vs. ""hemorrhaging"") we have 21k^4, which is only about 2E17 possibilities. With the 18 billion/sec setup (a single machine with 8 GPU's if we're facing a single SHA1 iteration), that's about 4 months to exhaustively search the keyspace. If we had ten such setups, that's about two weeks. If we excluded unlikely words like ""dumpier"", that's a lot faster for a quick first pass.
Now, if you get words out of a ""huge"" linux american english wordlist, like ""Balsamina"" or ""Calvinistically"" (both chosen by using the ""go to row"" feature"", then we'd have 30k words of length 5 or less 115k words of length 7 or less 231k words of length 9 or less 317k words of length 11 or less 362k words of length 13 or less
Even with the 7 length max limit, with this huge dictionary as a base and randomly chosen words, we have 115k^4 ~= 1.8E20 possibilities, or about 12 years if the setup is kept up to date (doubling in power every 18 months). This is extremely similar to a 13 character, lower case + number only password. ""300 years"" is what most estimates will tell you, but they fail to take Moore's Law into account.

","Well, as your post is general, let me state a few general things:

MD5, SHA-0, SHA-1 are all broken hashes, and you should not use them for any cryptographic purpose, use SHA-2.
You should, generally, use well-known and documented approaches to derriving keys from passwords (you don't mention what language, please say which one you are using).
When doing any sort of security programming, the most important thing to do is, before you do anything, strictly document your 'threat model'. This is basically a listing of all the attacks you are trying to prevent, and how you will do it, and also what sort attacks you can't prevent against. It's quite fun to do, and you'll get to learn about all the attacks and other interesting things.

","The answer to your new question is: you should definitely be using something like PBKDF2 to generate the key.

Using something like PBKDF2 (and a random salt!) increases the cost of breaking the encryption on the file.
What I really recommend is that you use this as a toy and not to protect something you really care about. If you are not a security expert, you are going to make mistakes, even the experts (and lots of them together) make mistakes: http://www.sslshopper.com/article-ssl-and-tls-renegotiation-vulnerability-discovered.html

"20047418","PBKDF2 with HMAC in Java","I am working on a Java project where I must ensure the confidentiality and integrity of users password saved in a plaintext file. 
To do so, I will write only a hash of the password in the file. More specifically, my intention is to write the hash of the password and a random salt, plus the random salt itself, to avoid the use of rainbow and lookup tables. I also want to use key-stretching with PBKDF2, to make the computation of the hash computationally expensive. 
Finally, I would like to use a keyed hash algorithm, HMAC, for a final layer of protection.
I am trying to implement my thoughts in a Java code, and I have found some examples of the operations that I have presented above:
private static byte[] pbkdf2(char[] password, byte[] salt, int iterations, int bytes)
    throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException
{
    PBEKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password, salt, iterations, bytes * 8);
    SecretKeyFactory skf = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1"");
    return skf.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();
}

The thing that I really cannot understand is how to input my secret key as the key used by the HMAC algorithm, as it doesn't seem an input to the function. I have looked through the Java documentation, but I cannot find a solution to my question.
At this point, I am not really sure if I understood correctly how the different part of the encryption mechanism work, so I would accept any help on the topic.
","I think I see the confusion. You're apparently expecting your code to apply PBKDF2 then HMAC-SHA-1. That's not how it works: HMAC-SHA-1 is used inside PBKDF2.
The gist of PBKDF2 is to apply a function repeatedly which has the following properties:

it takes two arguments;
it returns a fixed-size value;
it is practically undistinguishable from a pseudo-random function.

HMAC-SHA-1 is such a function, and a common choice. There are other variants of PBKDF2, using HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA-256, or other functions (but these variants aren't in the basic Java library).
PBKDF2 takes two data inputs (plus some configuration inputs): the password, and a salt. If you want to include a secret value in the calculation, PBKDF2's input is the place for it: don't tack on a custom scheme on top of that (doing your own crypto is a recipe for doing it wrong). Append the pepper (secret value common to all accounts) to the salt (public value that varies between accounts).
Note that pepper is of limited usefulness. It's only useful if the hashes and the pepper secret value are stored in different places — for example, if the hashes are in a database and the pepper is in a disk file that is not directly vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

In the .NET docs , it says that PasswordDeriveBytes uses ""an extension of the PBKDF1 algorithm"" which is later in the document specified as ""the PKCS#5 v2.0 standard"", which is PBKDF2 (as far as I can tell). Everywhere on the net I've found (including here on Stack Exchange), though, everyone says ""use Rfc2898DeriveBytes, cause Password* is deprecated and uses PBKDF1"". But the only difference in the docs at msdn.microsoft.com seems to be that the Rfc*-version specifically mentions PBKDF2, where Password* says ""extension of PBKDF1"" and ""PKCS#5 v 2.0"". 
So, can anyone tell me what the difference is between the two classes (if any) and why I should use one rather than the other for PBKDF2 password key derivation?
Now, other code, that deals with the same data, explicitly uses PBKDF2, and works, so that would suggest that indeed PasswordDeriveBytes also uses PBKDF2, or that PBKDF2 is simply compatible with PBKDF1 under certain circumstances, but I want to know for sure that it's not some side effect of some random thing, and that things just magically works (and eventually probably will magically and spectacularly break) without anyone really understanding why.
","PKCS#5 v2.0 defines both PBKDF1 and PBKDF2, the former for reasons of backwards compatibility and also recommends you use PBKDF2 for new applications. I've no idea why the latter is better than the former, but the two .NET classes do seem to use different but interoperable algorithms. (Possibly because only the resulting key is being exchanged, not the inputs + KDF.)

","Here's a blog post detailing the differences:
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnfa/archive/2004/04/14/generating-a-key-from-a-password.aspx
PBKDF2 can be used to generate keys of any length, which is very useful for password-based encryption (it can generate any key length as required by the symmetric cipher) but means less for secure password storage. It also applies the salt using HMAC instead of concatenation like PBKDF1, which has better security properties in cases of weak salts.

","I think a great answer to this would be found here:
C# PasswordDeriveBytes Confusion
But to sumup:
Microsoft's implementation of original PKCS#5 (aka PBKDF1) include insecure extensions to provide more bytes than the hash function can provide (see bug reports here and here).
Even if it was not buggy you should avoid undocumented, proprietary extensions to standards (or you might never be able to decrypt your data in the future - at least not outside Windows.)
I strongly suggest you to use the newer Rfc2898DeriveBytes which implements PBKDF2 (PKCS#5 v2) which is available since .NET 2.0.

","If you instantiate PasswordDeriveBytes and make a single call to the GetBytes method passing a value which is smaller than the output size of the underlying digest algorithm then you get back a value from the PBKDF1 algorithm.
If you make two calls to GetBytes for the same object you may encounter a counting bug in the implementation.
PBKDF1 is only described to output up to the size of the hash algorithm (e.g. 20 bytes for SHA-1), but the PasswordDeriveBytes class has made up a formula to support up to 1000 times the hash output size.  So a large value produced by this class may not be easily attainable in another platform.

If you instantiate Rfc2898DeriveBytes you get a streaming implementation of the PBKDF2 algorithm. The most obvious difference of PBKDF2 over PBKDF1 is that PBKDF2 allows the generation of an arbitrary amount of data (the limit is (2^32-1)*hashOutputSize; or for SHA-1 85,899,345,900 bytes).  PBKDF2 also uses a more complex construction (in particular, HMAC over direct digest) to make recovering the input password from an output value more difficult.
The ""streaming"" in the implementation is that the concatenation of GetBytes(5) and GetBytes(3) is the same as GetBytes(8). Unlike in PasswordDeriveBytes, this works correctly in Rfc2898DeriveBytes.

PBKDF1 was originally created to generate DES keys, published in PKCS #5 v1.5 in 1993.
PBKDF2 was published in PKCS #5 v2.0 (which was republished as RFC2898) in 1999. A slide deck which should be found at ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-5v2/pkcs5v2-0.pdf (but seems to be having issues so ftp://ftp.dfn-cert.de/pub/pca/docs/PKCS/ftp.rsa.com/99workshop/pkcs5_v2.0.ppt may hve to do) further summarizes differences. (The slide deck was written by RSA Security, the creators of PBKDF1 and PBKDF2, and they are the people who recommend PBKDF2 over PBKDF1).

Well the main questions is, what am I doing wrong on C++'s CryptoPP
  library that it is not deriving the same value.

SOLUTION: I was being dumb... I realized after review my original implementation on JavaScript and C# I missed a crucial step that for some reason I did not get a complain from the compiler. Basically the problem was that I did not convert the key used into byte data before the algorithm on my C# and JS implementation...
Anyways, proposed solution is: do not code at 4 AM and make sure to be consistent on your data conversion...
I guess the TL;DR of this is that C# and JS was converting my 256bit key to byte data as ASCII instead of base64 conversion.

Well the main questions is, what am I doing wrong on C++'s CryptoPP library that it is not deriving the same value.

Well, I don't think you are doing anything wrong in C++ with Crypto++ and PBKDF2. I think the other libraries are setting up the parameters differently, or they are a tad-bit non-standard.
I was able to arrive at the IETF's test vectors for PBKDF2 using Crypto++:
// From https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6070.txt
//   PKCS #5: Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) Test Vectors
//
//      Input:
//       P = ""password"" (8 octets)
//       S = ""salt"" (4 octets)
//       c = 1
//       dkLen = 20
//
//     Output:
//       DK = 0c 60 c8 0f 96 1f 0e 71
//            f3 a9 b5 24 af 60 12 06
//            2f e0 37 a6    (20 octets)

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    byte password[] =""password"";
    size_t plen = strlen((const char*)password);

    byte salt[] = ""salt"";
    size_t slen = strlen((const char*)salt);

    int c = 1;
    byte derived[20];

    PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC<CryptoPP::SHA1> pbkdf2;
    pbkdf2.DeriveKey(derived, sizeof(derived), 0, password, plen, salt, slen, c);

    string result;
    HexEncoder encoder(new StringSink(result));

    encoder.Put(derived, sizeof(derived));
    encoder.MessageEnd();

    cout << ""Derived: "" << result << endl;

    return 0;
}

And a run of the program:
$ ./cryptopp-test.exe
Derived: 0C60C80F961F0E71F3A9B524AF6012062FE037A6


I think the first thing you should do is verify the C# and Javascript implementations are using the same character encoding as Crypto++ and the IETF.
If that's not it, then check to see if C# and Javascript use the purpose byte. Crypto++ does not, and you can see the implementation at pwdbased.h.

Unfortunately, I get something a little different when I dial in your parameters:
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    string t1 = ""Y1Mjycd0+O+AendY5pB58JMlmS0EmBWgjdj2r2KW6qQ="";
    string t2 = ""5iFv54dCRq5icQbD7QHQzg=="";

    string pw, iv;

    Base64Decoder b1(new StringSink(pw));
    b1.Put((const byte*)t1.data(), t1.size());
    b1.MessageEnd();

    Base64Decoder b2(new StringSink(iv));
    b2.Put((const byte*)t2.data(), t2.size());
    b2.MessageEnd();

    int c = 100;
    byte derived[32];

    cout << ""pw size: "" << pw.size() << endl;
    cout << ""iv size: "" << iv.size() << endl;

    PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC<CryptoPP::SHA1> pbkdf2;
    pbkdf2.DeriveKey(derived, sizeof(derived), 0, (byte*)pw.data(), pw.size(), (byte*)iv.data(), iv.size(), c);

    string result;
    HexEncoder encoder(new StringSink(result));

    encoder.Put(derived, sizeof(derived));
    encoder.MessageEnd();

    cout << ""Derived: "" << result << endl;

    return 0;
}

A run results in:
$ ./cryptopp-test.exe
pw size: 32
iv size: 16
Derived: F6D4725C2A102D36D438BAA6DCCE0E3C64FA376E60FA8D0AD3DD1F569FE17E59

    def _pseudorandom(x, mac=mac):
        h = mac.copy()
        h.update(x)
        return map(ord, h.digest())
    buf = []
    for block in xrange(1, -(-keylen // mac.digest_size) + 1):
        rv = u = _pseudorandom(salt + _pack_int(block))
        for i in xrange(iterations - 1):
            u = _pseudorandom(''.join(map(chr, u)))
            rv = starmap(xor, izip(rv, u))
        buf.extend(rv)
    return ''.join(map(chr, buf))[:keylen]

This function returns binary digest which is then encoded in base64 and saved to database. Also that base64 string is set as a cookie when a user logs in.
This function is used for password hashes comparison:
def comparePasswords(password1, password2):
    if len(password1) != len(password2):
        return False
    diff = 0
    for x, y in izip(password1, password2):
        diff |= ord(x) ^ ord(y)
    return diff == 0

I wonder if there is any difference in comparison of binary hashes and base64 strings in terms of security? For example when a user logs in, I calculate binary digest of submitted password, decode base64 string from the database and then compare two binary hashes, but in case the user has a cookie with base64 string, I directly compare it with the a string from the database.
The second question is about salt:
os.urandom returns binary string, but before it is used in hash generation I also encode it in base64. Is there any reason why I shouldn't do this and use salt in binary form?
","To answer question 1: There's no major security difference when comparing bytes vs comparing a base64 encoded string... you're just comparing n or n*4/3 elements. The runtime will be 4/3 longer using base64, but the amount of time is still trivial :)  
That said, there was a python developer discussion regarding a similar ""constant time"" comparison function, and they hit upon a few VM-level gotchas - if your input is a unicode string rather than bytes, and especially if the unicode contains non-ASCII characters, there may still be some subtle timing attacks (orders of magnitude less than the short-circuit-equality attack). Because of that, I'd stick to bytes if possible (whether binary data or ASCII-encoded base64 data). 
However, I wouldn't worry too much in the case of PBKDF2, since the timing attack that comparison function was designed to defeat applies more to HMAC signing, rather than password hash verification... but better to be safe than sorry.
To answer question 2: For insecure constructions such as md5(salt+password), encoding the salt first would allow an attacker to use existing ASCII md5 tables to attack the entire digest, where a raw binary salt would make such tables useless. However, PBKDF2-HMAC does enough mangling that the only thing which matters is that the salt contains n bits of entropy - whether it's in the form of n/8 raw bytes, or n/6 base64 chars doesn't affect security.
Other notes: 
I just wanted to add a few other points relating to what you posted... 

For security purposes I'd strongly recommend using SHA256/512 instead of SHA1 as the PBKDF2-HMAC hash function, and >= 10,000 rounds (as of 2012), for security. 
The idea of sending the digest over in a cookie (even w/o the salt) strikes me as potentially insecure... if someone steals that cookie (e.g. cross-site scripting attack), they could potentially log in as the user (though I don't know the rest your application's security setup). Using a session layer with a randomly generated session id (e.g. Beaker) might be a good alternative.
I'd recommend using the Passlib PBKDF2 and consteq implementations, it's PBKDF2 routine is about 5x faster than mitsuhiko's, and can take advantage of M2Crypto if present. (disclaimer: I'm the author of Passlib). It's also got a ready-made pbkdf2-sha256 password hashing function, though that won't be quite as much use if you're sending the digest out in the cookie.

1000 is the number of passes, and 128 is the key size. The function returns a binary key which I use base64 to store it in the database.
My question is: what's the recommended keysize and salt size for pbkdf2 using sha512?
will a keysize of 32 be just as secure as a keysize of 128?
","1000 is the number of iterations, not passes. 128 Is the length at the end.
According to Wikipedia (and my own little knowledge about cryptography) you should use more than 128 bits (or 32 as you're asking). The size of the resulting key is equivalent to the chance for a hash collision. Using 256 (as WPA2 does) or 512 should not be a problem, also not a problem for your CPU/memory/whatever.
Also 1000 is, compared to other integrations of pbkdf2, a very small amount of iterations. You can easily use 5000 or 10000 (like iOS4) which might result in something like 10ms more processing time but makes a way more stronger key (see: a possible attacker has also to run the 10k iterations. This might change the time he needs from 1 day to 10 days, or 1 month to almost 1 year).

Password: Simple123
","I faced a similar task where I have to authenticate users against Django passwords in Java. After trying unsuccessfully to achieve this goal using the default pbkdf2_sha256 hasher in Django, I ended up changing the method used to hash the Django password to be able to easily replicate the same algorithm in Java.
As described in Django documentation you can modify the order in which PASSWORD_HASHERS are defined in settings.py, I put this hasher in first position:
'django.contrib.auth.hashers.SHA1PasswordHasher'
In this way the password hash stored in the Django database is something like this:
sha1$upSZarr0w7CZ$304b22b1a9e7e5387e79f50e691043d3faf83c48
If you already have some passwords in the database they will be automatically converted by Django at first user login.
You can easily tokenize the hash using $ as separator; the first token is always sha1 (the algorithm used), the second token is the salt and the last token is the actual hash.
To match a password you can verify that
304b22b1a9e7e5387e79f50e691043d3faf83c48
is the SHA1 sum of the salt concatenated with the expected password:
SHA1(upSZarr0w7CZ + password) = 304b22b1a9e7e5387e79f50e691043d3faf83c48
In our case the security implications of using a weaker algorithm for password hashing was acceptable.

A sample usage:
var hashers = require('node-django-hashers');

var h = new hashers.PBKDF2PasswordHasher();
var hash1 = h.encode(""password"", h.salt());
console.log(h.verify(""password"", hash1)); // returns true

"13545677","python passlib: what is the best value for ""rounds""","from the passlib documentation

For most public facing services, you can generally have signin take upwards of 250ms - 400ms before users start getting annoyed.

so what is the best value for rounds in a login/registration if we consider that there is one call for the database for the login attempt, and it uses MongoDB with non-blocking call. (using Mongotor, and using the email as the _id, so it is by default indexed, the query is fast: 0.00299978256226 and of course tested with a database that has 3 records...)
import passlib.hash
import time

hashh = passlib.hash.pbkdf2_sha512
beg1 = time.time()
password = hashh.encrypt(""test"", salt_size = 32, rounds = 12000)
print time.time()- beg1 # returns 0.142999887466
beg2 = time.time()
hashh.verify(""test"", password) # returns 0.143000125885
print time.time()- beg2

now if i use half value:
password = hashh.encrypt(""test"", salt_size = 32, rounds = 4000) # returns 0.0720000267029
hashh.verify(""test"", password) # returns 0.0709998607635

am using Windows 7 64 bits on Dell XPS 15 i7 2.0 Ghz
NB: installed bcrypt, and of course, it's a real pain using it directly as its default values (rounds = 12):
hashh = passlib.hash.bcrypt
beg1 = time.time()
password = hashh.encrypt(""test"", rounds = 12) # returns 0.406000137329
print time.time()- beg1
beg2 = time.time()
hashh.verify(""test"", password) # returns 0.40499997139
print time.time()- beg2

half value:
password = hashh.encrypt(""test"", rounds = 12) # 0.00699996948242 wonderful?
hashh.verify(""test"", password) # 0.00600004196167

can you suggest me a good rounds value when using pbkdf2_sha512 that will be good for production?
","(passlib developer here)
The amount of time pbkdf2_sha512 takes is linearly proportional to it's rounds parameter (elapsed_time = rounds * native_speed). Using the data for your system, native_speed = 12000 / .143 = 83916 iterations/second, which means you'll need around 83916 * .350 = 29575 rounds to get ~350ms delay. 
Things are a little tricker for bcrypt, because the amount of time it takes is logarithmically proportional to it's rounds parameter (elapsed_time = (2 ** rounds) * native_speed). Using the data for your system, native_speed = (2 ** 12) / .405 = 10113 iterations/second, which means you'll need around log(10113 * .350, 2) = 11.79 rounds to get ~350 ms delay. But since BCrypt only accepts integer rounds parameters, so you'll need to pick rounds=11 (~200ms) or rounds=12 (~400ms). 

All of this is something I'm hoping to fix in a future release of passlib. As a work in progress, passlib's mercurial repo currently contains a simple little script, choose_rounds.py, which takes care of choosing the correct rounds value for a given target time. You can download and run it directly as follows (it may take 20s or so to run):
$ python choose_rounds.py -h
usage: python choose_rounds.py <hash_name> [<target_in_milliseconds>]

$ python choose_rounds.py pbkdf2_sha512 350
hash............: pbkdf2_sha512
speed...........: 83916 iterations/second
target time.....: 350 ms
target rounds...: 29575  

$ python choose_rounds.py bcrypt 350
hash............: bcrypt
speed...........: 10113 iterations/second
target time.....: 350 ms
target rounds...: 11 (200ms -- 150ms faster than requested)
target rounds...: 12 (400ms -- 50ms slower than requested)


(edit: added response regarding secure minimum rounds...)
Disclaimer: Determining a secure minimum is a surprisingly tricky question - there are a number of hard to quantify parameters, very little real world data, and some rigorously unhelpful theory. Lacking a good authority, I've been researching the topic myself; and for off-the-cuff calculations, I've boiled the raw data down to a short formula (below), which is generally what I use. Just be aware that behind it are a couple of pages of assumptions and rough estimates, making it more of a Fermi Estimation than an exact answer :|
My rule of thumb (mid 2012) for attacking PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 using GPUs is: 
 days * dollars = 2**(n-31) * rounds


days is the number of days before the attacker has a 50/50 chance of guessing the password.
dollars is the attackers' hardware budget (in $USD).
n is the average amount of entropy in your user's passwords (in bits). 

To answer your script-kiddie question: if an average password has 32 bits of entropy, and the attacker has a $2000 system with a good GPU, then at 30000 rounds they will need 30 days (2**(32-31)*30000/2000) to have a 50/50 chance of cracking a given hash. I'd recommend playing around with the values until you arrive at a rounds/days tradeoff that you're comfortable with. 
Some things to keep in mind:

The success rate of a dictionary attack isn't linear, it's more of ""long tail"" situation, so think of the 50/50 mark as more of a half-life. 
That 31 is the key factor, as it encodes an estimation of the cost of attacking a specific algorithm using a specific technology level. The actual value, 2**-31, measures the ""dollar-days per round"" it will cost an attacker. For comparison, attacking PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 using an ASIC has a factor closer to 46 -- larger numbers mean more bang for the attacker's buck, and less security per round for you, though script kiddies generally won't have that kind of budget :)

The problem is that in JavaScript you additionally hash the password with SHA1. Don't do that and pass the password directly into PBKDF2 in the same way you do this in Java.
The second problem is that the ciphertext should be in the native format of CryptoJS when trying to decrypt. Since you get the base 64 encoded ciphertext from Java, you have to decode it as such. Uncomment the line:
var encMsg = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(encMsg64);

and don't do encMsg64 = encMsg64.toString( CryptoJS.enc.Base64); since this will encode the already encoded ciphertext again.

For the updated code, you cannot print your key and salt simply as a string and expect it to work in JavaScript. Those are byte[] for a reason. They contain unprintable characters which will be lost when you try to parse it in JavaScript. You have to encode all the byte[] values that you want to transport from Java to JavaScript as Base64 and then decode them in JavaScript.

Also, I have just noticed that it is storing totally different hashes for passwords that are the same.
Am I doing this right?
","It's hard to give an exact answer to a question as broad as 'Am I doing this right?' I can say that the entire point of salting passwords before hashing is so that the resultant hash will be unique between users. So getting different output for the same input is a good thing. Look up 'dictionary attack' for more information on why.
As to your code, it sounds like what you really want to know is why your salt isn't getting stored to the database. Debugging steps I can think of, without more specific details

$salt could be false, mcrypt_create_iv returns false on error (unlikely because of the hash output differences you mentioned above, but worth checking.
Output characters are not recognized as you suspect. You could try converting the database column types to varbinary and using a string to binary or hex decoder before adding to your prepare.
Try experimenting with column types with different character encodings and see what column type your salts can go into. UTF-8 uses a variable number of bytes for each character, which makes me uncomfortable when dealing with things that are absolutes. A salt and a hash are generally considered to be fixed-with bit fields, often expressed in hex format for convenience.

I might be able to narrow down a problem if you provided your server environment, php version, mysql version etc. and a few samples of salts which aren't being stored correctly.

https://defuse.ca/php-pbkdf2.htm into a small PHP image gallery I'm building to teach myself some PHP.
I understand that you store the salt and the hash in the database and then reconstruct them to match when the user enters their password. What I don't understand is how the validate_password function on the above website works when it generates a different, unique salt for the same password.
For example, I created a test repeatedly generating a password of just my name (andrew). Each time the final hash was different, presumably due to the salt being unique? However, it did not matter which generated hash I compared the password too, it validated it. (It obviously didn't validate a totally different password like Andrew56 or ndrew1).
Can anyone explain to my simple self why this is the case? It seems like I don't even need to store the salt? I hope this isn't off topic.

","I found this looking for a PBKDF2 implementation for an older PHP version. For anyone else happening to hit this page, if you're using this method directly:
pbkdf2($algorithm, $password, $salt, $count, $key_length, $raw_output = false)

Then, it does NOT include the salt with the output string, just the hash, which is what I was desiring.
The create_hash method is what the Original Poster was using and, with his settings above, that would return:
sha256:1000:$salt:$hash

This allows you to save it all in one db column, which is easy to use.  However, I would note that you ""might"" still want to split it up if you care about storage space.  With a hexidecimal salt and password, you can reduce the storage space it takes in half by storing it in a binary column...e.g. in MySQL this is done with SET binaryColumn=UNHEX('0F0F'), and then SELECT HEX(binaryColumn) AS binaryColumn.  It's more work, so it comes down to your own preference and goals, but thought I'd throw it out there.

"14825477","basic php pbkdf2 hashing","I am relatively new to php, and just beginning to grasp the point of salt when it comes to hashing passwords (I think?). Anyways, here's my problem...
Right now I have a mysql database with a username, password, salt field. The password field length is 64 chars, the salt field is 3 chars. Upon registry, each username is assigned a random salt. I am not having any issues with this (I believe). First, the user's desired password is hashed via:
$hashedinput = hash ('sha256', $input);

The user's desired password is then hashed with the salt included with pbkdf2 by the following procedure, and entered in the database:
$password = pbkdf2('sha256', $hashedinput, $salt, 10000, 64);

My problem is the log in. When comparing the hashed password in the database to the password the user inputs, it always comes back !=. Here is what I do to validate login:
$userData = mysql_fetch_array($search, MYSQL_ASSOC);
$inputhash = hash('sha256', $input); // From Form
$salt = $userData['salt']; // Salt from DB
$password = pbkdf2('sha256', $inputhash, $salt, 10000, 64);
$knownpassword = $userData['password']; // Known password from DB

So, to troubleshoot I echo'd all the outputs and this is what it looks like when I enter the CORRECT password (and it doesn't log me in):
Input password: 3d8bc905668c1a1cca5b53a78941d3ca4673e12df6ac5e98e19fa47b153406f6e66913e43bf60478907ca07429b0cf90c808ce2097e0544cc44d298bfb7b85ad
DB password: 3d8bc905668c1a1cca5b53a78941d3ca4673e12df6ac5e98e19fa47b153406f6
Note that the input password has the first 64 characters correct, but it continues to go on for 128 chars total. The DB password is just 64.
Thanks ahead of time!
","Thomas Ptacek wrote a great article a while back explaining - in some detail - what salt is, why it's useful, and gave the #1 rule you need to memorize regarding password hashing systems:

Use someone else’s password system. Don’t build your own.

If you are going to be using PHP 5.5 in your application, use the new password_hash API; if you're not, make sure you're using at least PHP 5.3 and use the password_hash userland compatability library. They are designed to take all the pain out of this for you.

","Well.. you're creating hashed password, but not saving it anywhere.
And because you're saving form (which inherits from ModelForm), the password fields is saved straight from the password form field.
You can override save method and set hashpass as password. But I think the best practice here is to use UserCreationForm which handles password hashing for you (it will use the first password hasher from your list).
There are some examples here on SO, showing how to customize UserCreationForm, so search around.

I'm using the project to learn coffeescript. I'm having trouble getting the data out of the callbacks. Here's my code:
keygen = (password, salt, iterations) ->
  key = 1
  pbkdf = new PBKDF2 password, salt, iterations, size_in_bytes
  pbkdf.deriveKey ((p) ->), ((k) ->
    key = k
    console.log ""within callback "" + key
    )
  console.log ""straight line path "" + key

Since deriveKey returns immediately, I don't have the data -- the last line prints ""1"". What's the proper way to deal with this? In java I would expect to get a Future-like object back, which I can join or wait on, but I realize that my backend habits may not be appropriate for UI code. Should I call a 'continue' function from the callback that moves on to the encryption and submitting the form?
","The usual approach is to send in a callback function that the asynchronous task can call when it has finished. Something like this:
keygen = (password, salt, iterations, finished) ->
  key = 1
  pbkdf = new PBKDF2 password, salt, iterations, size_in_bytes
  pbkdf.deriveKey ((p) ->), ((k) ->
    key = k
    console.log ""within callback "" + key
    finished key
    )
  console.log ""straight line path "" + key

So you'd supply the finished function when you call keygen and finished would do whatever needs to be done when the key is available. Your finished would usually be an anonymous closure.
You'll see a lot of this sort of thing if you look at any of the AJAX libraries (such as jQuery): you pass functions to functions, functions all the way down.

"15268890","why is my pbkdf2 implementation so slow (vs. SQLCipher)?","I have written a simple Android App on my Xoom tablet, which simply stores some string notes in a SQLCipher database. 
The user is prompted to type in a passphrase which will be used for the database by the SQLCipher lib. This works fine so far and very smooth.
Now I have also implemented a small PBKDF2 algorithm for authentication purposes
(in fact, i want to encrypt some other files in the future, wich cannot be stored in a database).
But as for now, i only came to check if my pbkdf2 algorithm is correct. 
I only used the javax.crypto and java.security libs.
Code snippet as follows:
int derivedKeyLength = 128;
int iterations = 500;
KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(passphrase.toCharArray(), salt, iterations, derivedKeyLength);
SecretKeyFactory f = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1"");
byte[] derivedKey = f.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();    

The salt is a 16 byte random number, generated with SecureRandom.
So I hardcoded the key and the salt and compare the the derivedKey for authentication (only a test case!)
My Problem now is, that on my Xoom it lasts about 5 seconds until the deriving function is done, although the iteration is set to 500 only.
AFAIK SQLCipher is using an iteration number of 4000 by default, and it responds instant, if the key is wrong or correct.
(if I set the iteration to 4000, it takes at least 15seconds)
The question is, did I implemented that inefficient or is it because SQLCipher is just that good in performance (native NDK functions, etc..)? 
Thank you in advance
p.s: sorry, my english isnt that great yet!
Edit: 
Sorry, I was not clear enough :-)
I know PBKDF2 is supposed to be slow (in specific the iteration amount, to slow down brute force attacks), thats exactly the reason I am asking! I wanted to set the iteration number to lets say  5000 (which is not acceptable, with over 15seconds)
I'm just wondering because, like I said, SQLCipher also uses PBKDF2 (Iteration = 4k, while I am using 500) for deriving a key from a given password. I'm not talking about the encryption with AES in the end, its only about the difference in deriving the key.
Of course it seems legit that SQLCipher is way faster than an self made keyderiving function, but I did not think that it would be this much difference, since SCLCipher's PBKDF2 really works instant!
Greetings!
","OK, that (see below) is not exactly your problem, PBKDF2 is slow but should be nowhere as slow as described with those parameters on that hardware.
There are some stats (and tips) here on Android PBE/KDF performance: http://nelenkov.blogspot.com/2012/04/using-password-based-encryption-on.html . SecretKeyFactory performance problems are not unknown: Any way around awful SecretKeyFactory performance with LVL and AESObfuscator? .
SecretKeyFactory is likely using pure Java implementation. SQLCipher has two relevant features:

it uses OpenSSL, compiled native code (on my desktop OpenSSL's PBKDF2 is nearly 100x faster than
a JVM6 SecretKeyFactory version for 2000 iterations, excluding JVM startup time. I haven't 
compared AES speed, it appears other people find it slow on Android too)
the 4000 iteration PBKDF2 is only done on database open, after that there's at most 2 iterations
for the page HMAC secret (assuming the default configuration, as documented)

Your code seems correct, there should not be such a large (linear?) performance degradation when you increase your iterations. The Xoom should be running a non-ancient JVM with JIT, can you verify the performance problem with other code?

PBKDF2 is designed to be slow (see the answer to this question https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/7689/clarification-needed-for-nists-whitepaper-recommendation-for-password-based-ke ) due to the intended key stretching operation. The iteration counter lets you trade off speed for security.
AES was always intended to be fast and is
fast (speed comparison PDF, the chosen AES candidate is referred to by its original name Rijndael in that paper).
I assume you are comparing the PBKDF2 computation time directly to the time taken to perform an SQL operation on your SQLCipher database which will almost certainly have been designed to be fast. 
You are effectively comparing two different operations with different requirements, hence the speed difference.

"15268890","why is my pbkdf2 implementation so slow (vs. SQLCipher)?","I have written a simple Android App on my Xoom tablet, which simply stores some string notes in a SQLCipher database. 
The user is prompted to type in a passphrase which will be used for the database by the SQLCipher lib. This works fine so far and very smooth.
Now I have also implemented a small PBKDF2 algorithm for authentication purposes
(in fact, i want to encrypt some other files in the future, wich cannot be stored in a database).
But as for now, i only came to check if my pbkdf2 algorithm is correct. 
I only used the javax.crypto and java.security libs.
Code snippet as follows:
int derivedKeyLength = 128;
int iterations = 500;
KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(passphrase.toCharArray(), salt, iterations, derivedKeyLength);
SecretKeyFactory f = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1"");
byte[] derivedKey = f.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();    

The salt is a 16 byte random number, generated with SecureRandom.
So I hardcoded the key and the salt and compare the the derivedKey for authentication (only a test case!)
My Problem now is, that on my Xoom it lasts about 5 seconds until the deriving function is done, although the iteration is set to 500 only.
AFAIK SQLCipher is using an iteration number of 4000 by default, and it responds instant, if the key is wrong or correct.
(if I set the iteration to 4000, it takes at least 15seconds)
The question is, did I implemented that inefficient or is it because SQLCipher is just that good in performance (native NDK functions, etc..)?

","Ok I figured out what the problem was.
If I disconnect the device from my PC it works instant. Also if I reconnect it after that.
Now even with an iteration amount of 5000 and above, the deriving function only needs less than a second!! This is great, since my Xoom isn't the newest of all devices!
May be it is because of the debug mode or something, I don't really know actually!
Anyways, thanks to mr.spuratic. Hope this helps someone in the future :-)

My problem is that I'm responding to a request for authentication and I'm in the middle of authenticating if the passed credentials are correct. I'm presuming that pbkdf2 is async as it could potentially take a large amount of time (dependant on the size of the iterations). However moving the remaining authentication logic into a separate method to utilise the callback seems a tad ugly.
Is there a better approach than either using a timer or throwing all the consecutive authentication logic into a separate function?

","I can see two solutions for your problem.
First one is to use some library to wrap asynchronous calls. You may try node-sync or node-promise. node-sync is better suited for what you want.
Second solution is to use bcrypt instead of crypto:
var bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
var salt = bcrypt.genSaltSync(10);
var hash = bcrypt.hashSync(password, salt);

bcrypt is a special library for password hashing in node. It's more secure then build-in crypto module and provides some useful methods like hashSync and compareSync.

","According to the Node.js crypto docs, there is both an asynchronous and synchronous version of the PBKDF2 function.

crypto.pbkdf2(password, salt, iterations, keylen, callback)
Asynchronous PBKDF2 applies pseudorandom function HMAC-SHA1 to derive
  a key of given length from the given password, salt and iterations.
  The callback gets two arguments (err, derivedKey).
crypto.pbkdf2Sync(password, salt, iterations, keylen)
Synchronous PBKDF2 function. Returns derivedKey or throws error.

"26168544","PBKDF2 Python keys vs .NET Rfc2898","I am trying to write a Python module that will encrypt text that our existing .NET classes can decrypt. As far as I can tell, my code lines, up but it isn't decrypting (I get an 'Invalid padding length' error on the C# side). My pkcs7 code looks good, but research indicates that invalid keys could cause this same problem.
What's different between these two setups? 
Python:
derived_key = PBKDF2(crm_key, salt, 256 / 8, iterations)
iv = PBKDF2(crm_key, salt, 128 / 8, iterations)

encoder = pkcs7.PKCS7Encoder()

encodedtext = cipher.encrypt(padded_secret)         # 2
based_secret = base64.b64encode(encodedtext)        # 3

I thought that based_secret could get passed up to C# and decoded there. But it fails. The same encrypting c# code is:

            cryptoProvider.Key = rfc.GetBytes(cryptoProvider.KeySize / 8);

                    }
                }
            }

The Python pkcs7 implementation I'm using is:
https://gist.github.com/chrix2/4171336
","First off, I verified that Rfc2898 and PBKDF2 are the same thing. Then, as stated above, the problem appears to be a .net ism. I found on msdn 
that the implementation of GetBytes inside of Rfc2898DeriveBytes changes on each call, ie. it holds state. (see the remarks about halfway down the page)
Example in Python (pseudo output):
derived_key = PBKDF2(key, salt, 32, 1000)
iv = PBKDF2(key, salt, 16, 1000)
print(base64.b64encode(derived_key))
print(base64.b64encode(iv))
$123456789101112134==
$12345678==

Same(ish) code in .NET (again, pseudo output):
var rfc = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(key, saltBytes);
    using (var cryptoProvider = new AesManaged())
    {
        // Set cryptoProvider parameters
        cryptoProvider.BlockSize = cryptoProvider.LegalBlockSizes[0].MaxSize;
        cryptoProvider.KeySize = cryptoProvider.LegalKeySizes[0].MaxSize;

        cryptoProvider.Key = rfc.GetBytes(cryptoProvider.KeySize / 8);
        cryptoProvider.IV = rfc.GetBytes(cryptoProvider.BlockSize / 8);
    }
Console.Writeline(Convert.ToBase64(cryptoProvider.Key));
Console.Writeline(Convert.ToBase64(cryptoProvider.IV));

$123456789101112134==
$600200300==

Subsequent calls to rfc.GetBytes always produces different results. MSDN says it compounds the key sizes on the calls. So if you call GetBytes(20), twice, it's the same as calling GetBytes(20+20) or GetBytes(40). Theoretically, this should just increase the size of the key, not completely change it. 
There are some solutions to get around this issue, which could be generating a longer key on the first call, then slicing it into both a derived key AND an IV, or randomly generating an IV, appending it to the encoded message and peeling it off before decrypting it. 
Slicing the python output produces the same results as .NET. It looks like this:
derived_key = PBKDF2(key, salt, 32, 1000)
iv = PBKDF2(key, salt, 32 + 16, 1000) # We need 16, but we're compensating for .NETs 'already called' awesomeness on the GetBytes method
split_key = iv[32:]

print(base64.b64encode(derived_key))
print(base64.b64encode(iv))
print(base64.b64encode(split_key))

$ 123456789101112134==   # matches our derived key
$ 12345678== # doesn't match
$ 600200300== # matches. this is the base 64 encoded version of the tailing 16 bytes.

I have tried looking at Bouncy Castle's documentation for their Scrypt class. However, I have a really hard time trying to figure out how it works. It doesn't seem to really give much information as to how to create the class or anything like that.
I searched around Stack Exchange and Google to see if there is anywhere that could give me a good example as to what I should do to create this class. I found this question and answer, and I tried it out without creating a class, but that didn't seem to work either.
To top this off, my import doesn't seem to want to work either.

public class SCrypt extends java.lang.Object {

    public Scrypt(){}

    public static byte[] generate(byte[] P,byte[] S,int N,int r,int p,int dkLen) {

    }
}

I want to use Scrypt since it seems to be the most secure in encrypting passwords, but it seems next impossible to implement. I'm really close with just going with a PBKDF2 since there is more documentation on it, but I'm hoping that there is someone out there who can help me get this going.
","Thanks Hugo for the feedback!

Unfortunately every time I call RAND_bytes, with the same seed, I obtain different random numbers, but this isn't the expected behaviour, because as say the answer at How can one securely generate an asymmetric key pair from a short passphrase? the random number generator is deterministic (same seed same output).
Below is the test case. I've declared also constant seed, but the generation is never deterministic.
unsigned int seed = 0x00beef00;
unsigned int rnum[5];
RAND_seed(&seed, sizeof(seed));

Where is the error?
","This is not an error.  The OpenSSL random number generator does some seeding on its own using good sources of randomness.  
So using the same seed value in RAND_seed does not guarantee the same sequence of random numbers.  This is a Good Thing because it makes them less predictable and therefore more secure.
From the man page for RAND_seed:

    #include <openssl/rand.h>

    void RAND_seed(const void *buf, int num);

    void RAND_add(const void *buf, int num, double entropy);

    int  RAND_status(void);

    int  RAND_event(UINT iMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);
    void RAND_screen(void);

RAND_add() mixes the num bytes at buf into the PRNG state. Thus, if
  the    data at buf are unpredictable to an adversary, this increases
  the    uncertainty about the state and makes the PRNG output less
  predictable.    Suitable input comes from user interaction (random key
  presses, mouse    movements) and certain hardware events. The entropy
  argument is (the    lower bound of) an estimate of how much randomness
  is contained in buf,    measured in bytes. Details about sources of
  randomness and how to estimate their entropy can be found in the
  literature, e.g. RFC 1750.
RAND_add() may be called with sensitive data such as user entered
  passwords. The seed values cannot be recovered from the PRNG
  output.
OpenSSL makes sure that the PRNG state is unique for each thread.
  On    systems that provide ""/dev/urandom"", the randomness device is
  used to    seed the PRNG transparently. However, on all other systems,
  the application is responsible for seeding the PRNG by calling
  RAND_add(),    RAND_egd(3) or RAND_load_file(3).
RAND_seed() is equivalent to RAND_add() when num == entropy.

So if your system has /dev/urandom, it will be used as the initial seed for the PRNG.

Force openssl's RNGs to return a repeatable byte sequence
As an aside, if you are doing RSA, a repeatable random sequence isn't all that good, because what you are looking for are two large primes.  Doing a large PRNG number, then testing for prime is probably a bad idea.  Half of them will be divisible by 2! :)
If I recall correctly, you need to pick a good starting number, make it odd by ORing with 1, then test for prime, and if it is not, increment by 4 and try again. 
Once you find them, you probably will not want to do it again using repeatable PRNG bytes to start your search.

Which is more secure? PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 is built into Java while BCrypt is available via jBCrypt library (which has mostly received positive reviews).
Also if I go with BCrypt should I limit my user's password entry to 55 characters only (since that is the limit of BCrypt)? 
It would be helpful if you are Java specific.
Do note that I would go for the option that makes the passwords more secure and brute-forcing more difficult.
","It doesn't really matter.
The difference between the security of the two of them is not significant enough to arrive at a meaningful choice. If you are looking for a thorough discussion, though, take a look at both links in Eugene's comments
What does matter is that you them correctly.
That means:

Choosing a right cost factor / iteration count. If you are thorough, you will want to benchmark how slow a hash function your servers can tolerate. The slower (=higher cost factor / iteration count) the better. To give you a ballpark number, my full disk encryption software has determined that PBKDF2 with HmacSHA1 needs ~10000 iterations to run 50ms.
Using salt correctly: Each password needs an accompanying random value (salt), that you store alongside the hash and use as input for each hashing. Don't use the same salt with every password, that would be pepper and is nice to have, but no replacement for salt.
Store your password in an upgradable way. At some time later you might want to change the cost factor or add a pepper value or change the hashing scheme to scrypt, once it is widely accepted. To allow for that, the database entries need to tell which parameter choice were used to generate the password. As an example, see this commonly used unix passwords storage format.

""Also if I go with BCrypt should I limit my user's password entry to 55 characters only (since that is the limit of BCrypt)?""
No. Hash the password once with SHA1 or SHA256 and use the output like you would have used the password before. If you want to apply pepper, this is the spot to do it. Finally, if it sounds like to much of a hassle, this might be the deciding factor to use PBKDF2 instead of bcrypt.

","They are not the same, and they are not equally secure.
On a CPU, they both use about the same amount of resources, and are about the same at defending the password.
The issue comes down to GPU based attacks. Due to the architectures of GPUs, bcrypt is actually harder to run than SHA1 (or SHA256). Therefore, it's easier to parallelize PBKDF2 + sha1 than it is bcrypt.
To put some actual numbers on it, we'll draw from This presentation.
Sha-1 is about 3x more expensive than md5. So if we look at the slow hashing function slides, we can conclude that md5crypt is about 3x faster than pbkdf2-sha1. That's quite a bit of guesswork, but it's in the margin of what we're looking for.
So that means, that for an equavilent CPU runtime, we can expect PBKDF2-sha1 to run about 25 Million hashes per second on the GPU cluster. Compare that to BCrypt (with cost 5) which runs at 75 Thousand hashes per second.
So that implies that PBKDF2+sha1 is about 1000 times weaker than bcrypt at equivalent cost settings.
Note though that PBDFK2+sha512 is almost as slow as bcrypt. This has to do with SHA-512 using 64 bit operations (which aren't native in today's GPUs). 
So in short, bcrypt is orders of magnitude more secure than PBKDF2+SHA1. It's more secure than PBKDF2+SHA512, but not by as much of a margin.
And this relies on GPU architecture of today. In the future, if cache sizes and instruction sets change significantly, these differences could wash out. And that's why newer algorithms like scrypt exist.
So just use bcrypt. And don't worry about the character limit

","Ended up getting it working using the https://github.com/defuse/password-hashing libraries, with some minor changes match the format of hashes I was working with database I'm importing.
But my main problem was with these lines where I'm trying to get a key out of a hash.
$dev = pbkdf2('sha1', '#0zEZcD7uNmv', $mySalt, 10000, 48, true);
$key = substr($dev, 0, 32); //Keylength: 32
$iv = substr($dev, 32, 16); // IV-length: 16

Changing it to the below, so that it is creating a hash hash that is 32 bits long and joining the returning hash to the salt fixed the issue.
$dev = pbkdf2('sha1', '#0zEZcD7uNmv', $mySalt, 10000, 32, true);
echo 'PASS: '.base64_encode($mySalt.$dev).'<br />';

"39647123","Salt in PBKDF2 - Python","I'm just learning about securing password while developing using MySQL and Python, following this tutorial.
It's my understanding that the userpassword is stored at the database hashed, and the salt is stored along side unencrypted, so that we can grab the hashed password and the salt, and rehash using the salt the inputted password, then compare the two.
Though, when using PBKDF2 (via the passlib.hash.sha256_crypt() function) I can't set my own salt, only its size. So how can I rehash the password using the same salt so I can compare both?
","The Passlib Password Hash interface either lets you set the salt size, or the salt value itself. From the documentation on pbkdf2_sha256:


salt (bytes) Optional salt bytes. If specified, the length must be between 0-1024 bytes. If not specified, a 16 byte salt will be autogenerated (this is recommended).
salt_size (int) – Optional number of bytes to use when autogenerating new salts. Defaults to 16 bytes, but can be any value between 0 and 1024.


so you can set your own pre-generated salt:
>>> from passlib.hash import pbkdf2_sha256
>>> pbkdf2_sha256.hash(""password"", rounds=200000, salt=b'spamhameggs')
'$pbkdf2-sha256$200000$c3BhbWhhbWVnZ3M$WL9OLVcb3f7HqHeNT./kCJeunydLCi4JykzEuAdewcI'

However, note that the salt is part of the returned string. The string contains not only the resulting hash, but also the algorithm, the number of rounds used and the salt used, delimited by $. The salt is encoded to modified form of base64. You can verify this by decoding the string c3BhbWhhbWVnZ3M again::
>>> from passlib.utils.binary import ab64_decode
>>> ab64_decode(b'c3BhbWhhbWVnZ3M')
b'spamhameggs'

See the Format & Algorithm section for the pbkdf2_sha256 docs.
So when you store the full string pbkdf2_sha256 in the database, everything to validate the string is right there in the value, including the salt. Leaving generating a random salt is best left to that library as it'll use a secure method to generate one.
You may want to read the Passlib tutorial on password hashing, which includes coverage of how to hash passwords when storing in the database, and how to verify them again (e.g. using pdkdf2_sha256.verify(password_user_entered, hash_stored_in_database)), which covers exactly this ground.

"19569042","Password salt and PBKDF2","I'm looking into different solutions regarding storing passwords in Database. After reading a lot I think i will end up with PBKDF2.
Although I'm a little bit confused regarding if I should input salt to my PBKDF2 function and store the salt in a column and the PBKDF2'd password in another column.
I'm also using CodeIgniter and found a library for PBKDF2 (https://github.com/HashemQolami/CodeIgniter-PBKDF2-Library) Which claims I don't need to store the salt separately.

Register user by using $pbkdf2['hash'] as user's password which has
  been recommended; no need to store user's salt separately.
https://github.com/HashemQolami/CodeIgniter-PBKDF2-Library#step-2

So if I'm assuming correct all I need is to provide a password into the function and the function take care of the rest?
","I'm the creator of CodeIgniter PBKDF2 Library. Just found this topic on SO, and I decide to clarify how this library works.
Here is the sample code from the doc:
# Load pbkdf2 library into your controller
$this->load->library('pbkdf2');

# Get password, which has been sent via POST method
$password = $this->input->post('password');

# Encrypt the given password using a random generated salt
$pbkdf2 = $this->pbkdf2->encrypt($password);

The encrypt() method, returns an array which has 3 keys: salt, password, hash. 
The value of hash is the concatenation of salt and password.
This feature lets the user to choose how to use this library, whether to work with salt and password or hash (salt + password).
The syntax of encrypt() method:
encrypt( string $password [, mixed $good_hash = NULL [, bool $object_output = FALSE]] )

The function uses the given $good_hash as the salt to generate the encrypted password. And it uses a random generated salt if the $good_hash parameter is not given.
So, If you have stored the salt separately, you could pass it to the function as the second parameter to encrypt the given password:
$pbkdf2 = $this->pbkdf2->encrypt($password, $salt);

On the other hand, If you have stored the concatenation of salt and password into database, you could pass that to the function as the second parameter, too:
$pbkdf2 = $this->pbkdf2->encrypt($password, $hash);

The function will break the given $hash automatically to fetch the salt.
So, you could store the concatenation of salt and password in a column (64 characters by default) and then encrypt the new given password by using old stored one.
Putting all together
In the following, I'll show you how to work with this library to register/login the user, without storing the salt and the password separately.
Registering the user:
$this->load->library('pbkdf2');
$password = $this->input->post('password');
$pbkdf2 = $this->pbkdf2->encrypt($password);

# Store $pbkdf2['hash'] into User table as the user's password

Logging in the user:
$this->load->library('pbkdf2');
$username = $this->input->post('username', TRUE);
$password = $this->input->post('password');

# Fetch the stored user's password from the database
$user_password = $this->user_model->get_password_by($username);

# Check whether the User exists
if ($user_password)
{
    # Encrypt the new given password by using the old one:
    $pbkdf2 = $this->pbkdf2->encrypt($password, $user_password);

    # Check whether the new generated password matches the old one
    if ($pbkdf2['hash'] === $user_password) {
        # Log in the user ...
    } else {
        # Show an error...
    }
} else {
    # Show an error... 
}

","$key_length is the number of output bytes that you desire from PBKDF2. (Note that if key_length is more than the number of output bytes of the hash algorithm, the process is repeated twice, slowing down that hashing perhaps more than you desire. SHA256 gives 32 bytes of output, for example, so asking for 33 bytes will take roughly twice as long as asking for 32.)
The doubling of the length that you mention is because the code converts the output bytes to hexadecimal (i.e. 2 characters per 1 byte) unless you specify $raw_output = true. The test vectors included specify $raw_output = false, since hexadecimal is simply easier to work with and post online. Depending on how you are storing the data in your application, you can decide if you want to store the results as hex, base64, or just raw binary data.

","Well, there is a fully working example here in MSDN.
But, if your purpose is really hash a password, I would not advise you to do it like that.
There is no need to decrypt your passwords.
It's much easier and safer if you just use the SHA256 algorithm. All you need to do is store the hashed password in your database and when someone attempt to login into your website you will hash the given password and compare with the value stored in your database. 
Doing this you have a one way encryption, so there is no way to decrypt your passwords. 
Why? If your application have been hacked, the attackers can't decrypt the stored passwords so they can't login.
There is a example on how to hash using SHA256 here. Really, it's much easier.

Sorry for mistakes.
","The Pbkdf2 class you found elsewhere on StackOverflow is not part of .NET, so to use it you'd need to obtain the library it's in.
In order to do PBKDF2 with (HMAC-)SHA-2-256, you would need at least .NET Core 2.0 or .NET Framework 4.7.2.
Either way you need to turn your salt into bytes.  Since it's a multiple of 4 characters I'm going to assume it's base64:
byte[] saltBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(salt);
byte[] derived;

.NET Framework (2.0+) (HMAC-SHA-1):
using (var pbkdf2 = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, saltBytes, interactionCount))
{
    derived = pbkdf2.GetBytes(32);
}

.NET Core (2.0+), .NET Framework (4.7.2+) (using HMAC-SHA-2-256):
using (var pbkdf2 = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(
    password,
    saltBytes,
    interactionCount,
    HashAlgorithmName.SHA256))
{
    derived = pbkdf2.GetBytes(32);
}

If you need to use something other than (HMAC-)SHA-1 in .NET Framework you'll need to upgrade to 4.7.2.

.NET Framework Rfc2898DeriveBytes (4.7)

AES is an encryption method. AES stands for ""Advanced Encryption Standard"".
Other things you will need to handle:

Encryption mode

Both PBKDF2 and AES are supported by iOS CommonCrypto.
What you need to do is a two step process:

I've been working on translating a small Java application into Node.js, which for the most part has been going very well. I've had to look up a lot of Java functions to figure out what they do and how to replicate their behaviour in Node (since I have pretty much no experience whatsoever with Java), but I got most of the functionality working by now.
Unfortunately there is one bit that I just can't seem to get working. It is a method used to generate a password hash, using a set of high level Java-specific functions that don't seem to exist in Node. I've been trying for two days to get this working but I just can't get the results I want.
This is the original Java code:
public static String hashPassword(final String password, final String salt) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException {
    final char[] passwordChars = password.toCharArray();
    final byte[] saltBytes = salt.getBytes();
    final PBEKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(passwordChars, saltBytes, 1000, 192);
    final SecretKeyFactory key = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1"");
    final byte[] hashedPassword = key.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();
    return String.format(""%x"", new BigInteger(hashedPassword));
}

Note: the salt is a fixed value, it is not random. I know this is not how it should be, but this is how the application is set up. So, since the Java code always gets the same result, it should be possible to get the same result in Node as well.
I've tried using crypto.pbkdf2, using various ciphers that seemed similar, but it all gave me a different outcome than the Java code. So I figured I'd ask here, to see if anyone knows how to do this, or has any suggestions on how to approach this.
Note that (as I said) I don't know a thing about Java, so my difficulties getting this to work probably come from the fact that I have a hard time grasping just what is happening within this method, and googling the various functions used gives conflicting answers and mostly just shows other people having a hard time with them as well.
So there are actually three questions I'm asking:

Is this possible to replicate in Node.js or does Java use functionality that just doesn't exist within Node?
Could someone who has more Java experience explain the various lines in this code, and what each one does? Preferably in a way that someone with a decent level of Node.js experience (and some PHP) but who never worked with Java would understand :)
If anyone knows, which Node functions am I looking at to get this working? Can I do it with the built-in crypto module or will I need additional modules?

Lastly, before you say ""just implement a Node-specific hashing algorithm"" (which would be the easier option), I can't do that since this is to be used on existing databases that already contain these hashed passwords and that are used by other existing Java applications as well. Changing the other applications or the database is currently not an option.
UPDATE: I've gotten an answer that was very helpful, and now I got this in my Node.js code:
hashPassword = function(password, salt){
    crypto.pbkdf2(password, new Buffer(salt), 1000, 24, 'sha1', function(err, key){

    }
}

That's where I'm stuck again. I can't get the string value I need from the key. I googled a bit and found out that the String.format line in the Java code turns the BigInteger into a hexadecimal integer, but I can't seem to get the correct value.

I tried simply key.toString('hex') but that didn't work.
I found this node-biginteger module, and tried BigInteger.fromBuffer(1, key).toString(24) and some variations thereupon, but it still gives me a very different outcome than the Java application.

Any help on how to get the correct string value from the buffer would be very much appreciated.
Update2: I finally got my application working, as it turns out it was an external module that outputted bad hashes. Implementing the crypto module properly fixed it.
","These parameters generate the same buffer:
crypto.pbkdf2('test', 'salt', 1000, 24, 'sha1', function(err, key) {});

What is left is to format a string the same way. It can be a bit problematic, since BigInteger is signed, so you should take sign into account as well.
You can do this as following using bn.js:
function format(key) {
  if (key[0] >>> 7 === 0) {
    return key.toString('hex');
  }

  return '-' + new BN(key.toString('hex'), 16).notn(192).add(new BN(1)).toString(16);
}

bn.js doesn't interpret leading bit as a sign, so you have to check it first, and then convert to string according to two's complement representation.

I found this node-biginteger module, and tried BigInteger.fromBuffer(1, key).toString(24) and some variations thereupon, but it still gives me a very different outcome than the Java application.

Any help on how to get the correct string value from the buffer would be very much appreciated.
Update2: I finally got my application working, as it turns out it was an external module that outputted bad hashes. Implementing the crypto module properly fixed it.
","I needed to get this to work with node 6, and it turns out, things have gotten simpler (not needing bigints).  I never would have figured this out without vkurchatkin's original answer, though:
console.log(hashPassword('password', 'salt').toString('hex'));

function hashPassword(password, salt) {
    return crypto.pbkdf2Sync(password, Buffer.from(salt, 'hex'), 1000, 24, 'sha1');
}

","The problem here is with your salt. It is only 6 bytes long and PHP handles this different then your c# code. If you update the code to the following:

$pass = ""1234567890"";
$mysalt = strrev($pass);
echo hash_pbkdf2('sha1', $pass, $mysalt, 1000, 32);

your output is: 42e8bfc7fc5fd4686915d49d5a29bc1e
Then adjust your c# code to:
var pass = ""1234567890"";
byte[] salt = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(pass.ReverseString());

//DISABLE YOUR PACK METHOD
//salt = Pack(pass.ReverseString());

var hash = PasswordHash.PBKDF2(pass, salt, 1000, 16);

Console.ReadKey();

The output is: 42e8bfc7fc5fd4686915d49d5a29bc1e
The difference comes from your Pack method, it randomly adds 4 bytes to the salt. You can see that easily in the inspector in VS.

So the easy fix is to use a salt that has atleast 8 chars (minimum for Rfc2898DeriveBytes which is used by your C# code) and dont use your Pack method
If you look at the php docs there is a ""Request for comments"" that mentions that the salt must be atleast 8bytes (64bit). So using less leads to conflicts, like you already encountered.
UPDATE
Now if you realy want to use the less secure salt with <8 bytes, you can look at the following stackoverflow question PBKDF2 implementation in C# with Rfc2898DeriveBytes for a c# version that doesnt require a minimum length.

"19594140","Better practice with PKBDF2, AES, IV and salt","So, I'm encrypting list of documents with AES algorithm. I use PBKDF2 to determine key from user password. I have a few question about store data and IV/salt:
How to store documents:

Encrypt all documents with one AES key, IV and salt
Encrypt each document with one AES key, but separate IV and salt

How to store/retrive IV and salt:

Get IV from PBKDF2 (like AES key) and no need to store it somewhere
Generate IV before every document encryption and store as plain text
For salt, I think, there are no option - anyway I need to store it as plain text

As I unterstand from that article (http://adamcaudill.com/2013/04/16/1password-pbkdf2-and-implementation-flaws/) and some others:

It's OK to store IV and salt as plain text, as sometimes attacker even don't need to know them
Different IV can only ""distort"" first cipher block (for CBC mode), but not all, so it doesn't bring mush security to AES method.

","Each document should have its own IV and salt. Since the salt varies, so will the AES key for each document. You should never encrypt two documents with the same key and IV. In the most common mode (CBC), reusing IV+Key leads to some reduction in security. In some modes (CTR), reusing IV+Key destroys the security of the encryption. (The ""IV"" in CTR is called the ""nonce,"" but it is generally passed to the thing called ""IV"" in most encryption APIs.)
Typically, you generate the IV randomly, and store it at the start of the file in plain text. If you use PBKDF2 to generate the IV, you need another salt (which you then need to store anyway), so there's not much point to that.
You also need to remember that most common modes of AES (most notably CBC) provide no protection against modification. If someone knows what your plaintext is (or can guess what it might be), they can modify your ciphertext to decrypt to some other value they choose. (This is the actual meaning of ""If you have the wrong IV when you decrypt in CBC mode it corrupts the first block"" from the article. They say ""corrupt"" like it means ""garbage,"" but you can actually cause the first block to corrupt in specific ways.)
The way you fix this problem is with either authenticated encryption modes (like CCM or EAX), or you add an HMAC.

I have stored this hashed password in the database. I don't know how to test this password against a login input since I don't have the salt and the salt is generated randomly for each user. How can I ""extract"" the salt from the stored password, prepend it to the inputted password and test the result against the stored password?
","You need to store the salt together with the hash, for example:
$hash = $salt . '|' . hash_pbkdf2(.., .., $salt, ..);

You can then later extract the salt from it again and feed it back into the validation algorithm. In fact, you should do this with all the relevant input parameters for the hash (except for the password itself, obviously), to allow you to change your algorithm later as needed while still being able to validate already hashed passwords:
$hash = $algo . '|' . $salt . '|' . $rounds . '|' . hash_pbkdf2($algo, .., $salt, $rounds, ..);

In fact, you should use the crypt API, which already does it like this.
But really, you should be using password_hash, which is a user-friendly wrapper around crypt which ensures that you do it right.

Finally, I would like to use a keyed hash algorithm, HMAC, for a final layer of protection.

But what if I create a random key (random 32 bytes), do I still need to use KDF on it to ensure proper encryption?
","A KDF is typically used for deriving cryptographic keys from things like passphrases, which as you correctly say are not suitable for direct use. But they are also used for deriving additional keys from a master key, which depending on your overall scheme, might be useful. 
Suppose you used a key agreement protocol where both parties ended up with a random shared secret. You could use a KDF to derive a key for encryption, and one for message integrity (for example, an HMAC key). 
From NIST SP800-108:

When parties share a secret symmetric key (e.g., upon a successful
  execution of a key-  establishment scheme as specified in 1 and
  [2]), it is often the case that additional keys will be needed (e.g.
  as described in [3]). Separate keys may be needed for different 
  cryptographic purposes – for example, one  key may be required for an
  encryption  algorithm, while another key is intended for use by an
  integrity protection algorithm, such  as a message authentication
  code. At other times, the distinct keys required by multiple  entities
  may be generated by a trusted party from a single master key.  Key
  derivation  functions are used to derive such keys.

The short answer is, no, you don't need to use a KDF, assuming your key generation is correct.

Memory error? Usage error?

Well, sometimes you can call ERR_get_error. If you call it and it makes sense, then the error code is good. If the error code makes no sense, then its probably not good.
Sadly, that's the way I handle it because the library is not consistent with setting error codes. For example, here's the library code to load the RDRAND engine.
Notice the code clears the error code on failure if its a 3rd generation Ivy Bridge (that's the capability being tested), and does not clear or set an error otherwise!!!
void ENGINE_load_rdrand (void)
{
    extern unsigned int OPENSSL_ia32cap_P[];

    if (OPENSSL_ia32cap_P[1] & (1<<(62-32)))
    {
        ENGINE *toadd = ENGINE_rdrand();
        if(!toadd) return;
        ENGINE_add(toadd);
        ENGINE_free(toadd);
        ERR_clear_error();
    }
}



How should my program handle it (retry, quit?)?

It looks like a hard failure.

Finally, that's exactly how I navigate the sources in this situation. If you don't like grep you can try ctags or another source code browser.

"9990064","HEX representation of byte array","I feel pretty stupid asking this, but as I don't know the answer, I'm going ahead anyway. 
I""m trying out some authentication code and want to know why the byte array I get from Rfc2898DeriveBytes needs to be converted to HEX and back to a byte array again for it to correctly initialise my HMACSHA1 object. I feel like I am doing something silly, or simply missing something obvious.
My client code is a javascript function based on crypto-js;
var key256bit = Crypto.PBKDF2(passwordEntered, saltBytes, 32, { iterations: 1000 }); 
var hmacBytes = Crypto.HMAC(Crypto.SHA1, url, key256bit, { asBytes: true });
var base64Hash = Crypto.util.bytesToBase64(hmacBytes);

My Server side code is as follows;
    Rfc2898DeriveBytes rfc2898 = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password,
                                              encoding.GetBytes(salt), 1000);
    byte[] key = rfc2898.GetBytes(32);

    // Don't think I should need to do this. 
    // However, it wont work if I initialise HMACSHA1 
    // with the rfc2898.GetBytes(32)
    string test = ByteArrayToString(key); 

    HMACSHA1 hmacSha1 = new HMACSHA1(encoding.GetBytes(test));

    byte[] computedHash = hmacSha1.ComputeHash(encoding.GetBytes(requestUri));
    string computedHashString = Convert.ToBase64String(computedHash);

My ByteArrayToString method which I nabbed from the web is;
private static string ByteArrayToString(byte[] ba)
{
    StringBuilder hex = new StringBuilder(ba.Length * 2);
    foreach (byte b in ba)
        hex.AppendFormat(""{0:x2}"", b);
    return hex.ToString();
}

So I can see that I get 32 bytes from my call to rfc2898.GetBytes(32). I converted that to HEX using the ByteArrayToString method to confirm it matches what I am seeing in my Javascript variable key256bit. Now my test variable is a string of length 64 and when I pass that to HMACSHA1's constuctor using encoding.GetBytes(test) it is a byte array of length 64.
The doco on crypto-js is a bit lacking, but I thought the call to Crypto.PBKDF2 with a param of 32 and it was creating a key of 32 bytes long (or 256 bits).
Any clarification is much appreciated.
","I suspect this is the root of the issue, in PBKDF2.js:
return options && options.asBytes ? derivedKeyBytes :
       options && options.asString ? Binary.bytesToString(derivedKeyBytes) :
       util.bytesToHex(derivedKeyBytes);

Because you haven't provided options for either asBytes or asString, it's converting the key to a hex representation - just as your C# code does. So at the moment you are using a 512 bit key, precisely because you're generating 2 bytes of ""used key"" from each byte of ""original key"".
I suspect that if you specify the asBytes option in the Javascript, it will just work without the extra hex part in the C# code.
Then again, I've never seen PBKDF2 before, so I could be way off base...

","So BouncyCastle(the crypto provider in Andorid) doesn't implement PBKDF2 using SHA256, so you will have to get very slightly custom.  This SO answer tells you which class to modify to get the algorithm set up.  Then you will need to integrate it, or figure out how to call it yourself (and I'm afraid I can't help much on that)
as far as the hash itself goes the format (as defined here) is:
<algorithm>$<iteration count>$<salt>$<hash>

where in your case the iteration count is 10000, your salt is the ascii string v2WJyd8HkqhU and the the hash is the byte array represented by the base64 string QVAp707PYTiFDHvzjwBCTbecr9+6q2OIPsunPyOxXGU=
You will compute the hash of the utf8 string of the password with the parameters specified.  Then, you can either base64 encode the output of the hash and compare the strings, or base64 decode the recieved hash and compare the byte arrays.  Apache Commons Codec provides some good Base64 encoding/decoding methods in its Base64 class.

Hashing a password with a reasonable number of iterations can easily block for 0.5 seconds. What is a lightweight way to take this out of process? I'm reluctant to setup something like Celery or Gearman just for this operation. 
","You could use a thread. This will not block tornado. Say that you have a handler that hashes passwords. Then the two relevant methods might look like this:
import threading

def on_message(self, message):
    # pull out user and password from message somehow
    thread = threading.Thread(target=self.hash_password, args=(user, password))
    thread.start()


def hash_password(self, user, password):
    # do the hash and save to db or check against hashed password

You could either wait for the thread to finish in the on_message method then write the response, or if you don't need to send a response then just let it finish and save the results in the hash_password method.   
If you do wait for the thread to finish you have to be careful how you do it. time.sleep will block so you will want to use tornado's non blocking wait instead.

What I am trying is to encrypt using RijndaelManaged. To create Key, I am passing password, salt and iteration to Rfc2898DeriveBytes.
I was thinking to add constant if user entered password is below specific length before passing it to Rfc2898DeriveBytes.
So far what I found that adding constant will not add any benefit to security. Let suppose attacker get an access to database containing encrypted data along with salt, but not to constant will give him a bit harder time. Although in the end he will find that constant.
Or it is ""really and extremely"" safe to pass any length password to Rfc2898DeriveBytes without getting worried?
Does passing shorter or lengthier password affect key derivation process in term of which one is better and most recommended?
So far what I know that random salt and more iteration is important.
Following is the code, should I remove adding constant to password or keep it?
(Note: password length restriction to user is not applied at GUI, user can pass 1 character or even more than 10 characters)
string constant = ""AnyConstantToMakePasswordBigger"";

if (password.Length < 8) 
{ 
password = password + constant; 
}

RNGCryptoServiceProvider rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();

byte[] salt = new byte[8];

rng.GetBytes(salt);

Rfc2898DeriveBytes derivedKey = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, salt, 1000);

using (RijndaelManaged aes = new RijndaelManaged())
{
     aes.Key = derivedKey.GetBytes(keyLength);
     .....
}

Welcoming any positive or negative comment and responses.
","With an assumption that the attacker doesn't know the ""constant"" then, yes, it would effectively increase security by making brute force attacks harder.  HOWEVER, that is a very bad assumption and you should ALWAYS assume the attacker has your source code.
Continuing on our bad assumption: You are correct that the attacker may eventually figure out your constant if enough passwords are cracked.
As to whether or not one adding more characters to your password improves key derivation: not really.  The key that you generate will be the same length no matter what.  But an attacker is not going to attempt to guess your key, they are too long and effectively impossible to brute force.  Any attacker is going to go after the password.
This is where iterations, salt and hard to guess long passwords come in. Iterations increase difficulty by increasing the time it takes to make each guess.  While the time to do thousands of iterations when a legitimate user logs in is negligible,  the cost to a brute force attacker is huge.  Long passwords additionally increase difficulty of brute force.  The salt helps to protect identical passwords from being solved at the same time (the attacker must attack each password independently even if they are the same).

","Starting from Android 4.4 the SecretKeyFactory API changed. Maybe this could help:

In Android 4.3 and earlier platform versions, the javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory implementation of  the PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 key-generation algorithm only uses the lower 8 bits of Java characters in passphrases. In Android 4.4, the algorithm is changed to use all available bits in Unicode characters, in compliance with recommendations in PCKS #5.
This change could affect applications that use symmetric encryption and meet all of the following conditions:
  1. Use SecretKeyFactory to generate symmetric keys, and
  2. Use PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 as their key-generation algorithm for SecretKeyFactory, and
  3. Allow Unicode input for passphrases

SecByteBlock derivedkey(SHA256::DIGEST_SIZE);

A CMAC works fine if you want to keep using AES.

You should not use anonymous declarations. It causes trouble for some GCC versions. That is, name your StringSource.

Note that p_count is the number of iterations and p_key_length is the length of the key. See this question for more information on the recommended number of iterations and recommended key length for PBKDF2.
Hope this helps.

","Use the Common Crypto CCKeyDerivationPBKDF function with the option kCCPRFHmacAlgSHA1.
Note PBEKeySpec keyLength is in bits, CCKeyDerivationPBKDF derivedKeyLen is in bytes.
For a more detailed answer provide all input (hashKey, salt) and the output in hex dump format plus the number of rounds, output length in bytes.
See this SO answer for sample code.

Update for revised question code:

CCKeyDerivationPBKDF returns 8-bit data bytes that is essentially not characters and many are not printable even if forced into NSASCIIStringEncoding. Forcing to NSASCIIStringEncoding even if there is no error returned is incorrect and non-useful. Instead either use the returned NSData or convert to Base64 or HexASCII encoding.
Change
NSString *myString =    [[NSString alloc] initWithData:derivedKey encoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding];

"22372553","jasypt PBKDF2 implementation","In org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.StandardPBEByteEncryptor, the key derivation looks different when I compared few other key derivation functionality.
The initialize() method has below code for generating a secret key:
PBEKeySpec pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(this.password.toCharArray());
SecretKeyFactory factory =   SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(this.algorithm);             
this.key = factory.generateSecret(pbeKeySpec);

which does not have the salt and iteration count passed into PBEKeySpec.
But the encrypt() method has below code:
PBEParameterSpec parameterSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, this.keyObtentionIterations);
byte[] encyptedMessage = null;
synchronized (this.encryptCipher) {
this.encryptCipher.init(
Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, this.key, parameterSpec);
encyptedMessage = this.encryptCipher.doFinal(message);
}

which has the salt and iteration count passed as PBEParameterSpec. 
According to PBKDF2, the secret keys are generated using a password, salt and iteration count. 
In the above code key is generated first in the initialize() method and salt, iteration count are passed as PBEParameterSpec in the encrypt() method.
The question is

Why the salt and iteration is used only during encrypt method is called, when it can be done inside initialize() method?
What makes the difference?

I am raising this question because, due to the above implementation, encrypt() and decrypt() operations are slow when the iteration count is increased.
Thanks in advance.
","The salt is applied for each encryption operation because a different salt is used for each message that is encrypted. 
The initialize() method executes only once, with the information that will be common to all executions (i.e. the encryption key). Whereas the encrypt() method has to take care of the encryption parameters --iteration count and salt--, which are different (the salt is) for each encryption operation.
The only way to improve performance of those encrypt() and decrypt() operations is therefore avoiding to produce a different salt for each message being encrypted, and that means having a fixed-salt generator. Jasypt 1.9.2 includes an improvement that detects whether such salt generation strategy is being used, and in such case avoids calling Cipher#init(...) with every encryption operation.

Should I be using the built-in library hashlib to implement something like this? I can't really find documentation for implementing a PBKDF2 encryption with iterations/salt as inputs. Should I be using pbkdf2? Sorry for the vague questions, I'm unfamiliar with the encryption process and feel like even just knowing what the correct constructor would be is a step in the right direction. 
","Yes, the Python equivalent is hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac. For example this code:  
from hashlib import pbkdf2_hmac

key = pbkdf2_hmac(
    hash_name = 'sha1', 
    password = b""somekeyvalue"", 
    salt = b""somekeyvalue"", 
    iterations = 12345, 
    dklen = 32
)

print(key)

produces the same key as your Java code.  
However, the problem with this code (as mentioned in memo's comment) is the use of salt. The salt should be random and unique for each password. You can create secure random bytes with os.urandom, so a better example would be:  
from hashlib import pbkdf2_hmac
from os import urandom

salt = urandom(16)
key = pbkdf2_hmac('sha1', b""somekeyvalue"", salt, 12345, 32)

You may also want to increase the number of iterations (I think the recommended minimum number is 10,000).  

The rest of the code is easy to 'translate'.  

For the timestamp, use time.time to get the current time and multiply by 1000.  
import time

milliseconds = str(round(time.time() * 1000))

For encoding you can use base64.urlsafe_b64encode (it includes padding, but you could remove it with .rstrip(b'=')).
Now, for the encryption part, Python doesn't have a built-in encryption module, so you'll have to use a third party library. I recommend pycryptodome or cryptography.
At this point I must warn you that the AES mode you're using is very weak. Please consider using CBC or CTR, or better yet use an authenticated encryption algorithm.

I'm not sure that is a good idea to store password like:
pass = PBKDF2_ITERATIONS + "":"" + toHex(salt) + "":"" +  toHex(hash);
Is there some other implementation?
","Cryptography based on secrecy will never work for any measurable duration of time.

When implementing a KDF like PBKDF#2 certain parameters are allowed to be known by the ""public"" as they are essential for proper usage. Being cryptic in your returned password isn't going to deter attackers for any measurable amounts of duration because you have to assume that they can reverse engineer your software with ease (lets face it, if they're going up against PBKDF#2, they probably can).
Not including the iteration count anywhere is like not including the salt or hash, at the same time, the value for the iteration count is as safe to transmit as the salt and hash. And working on the principal that attackers can reverse engineer your code, colon or no colon isn't some barrier in their way, they will find out eventually anyway.
Regarding if Java's PBKDF#2 is ""good"" I cannot give any solid facts on that. But considering its one of the most important cryptographic functions within the java crypto library I would assume it be one of the best implementations possible in java (not considering 3rd party libraries that make use of hardware-accelerated native code, thats cheating).

How can I generate the hash so it matches the way used by Symfony 2?
","Symfony does 5000 iterations with sha512. 

They concatenate raw password with user's salt to generate a new salt
They generate a starting hash with above data.
On each iteration previous hash its updated with the current hash + new salt generated at step 1.

In node, on each iteration you should digest previous hash as binary and in the end digest as base64, to mimic what Symfony does.
And an example:
var crypto = require('crypto');

var encodePassword = function (raw, salt) {
    var salted = raw + '{'+salt+'}',
        hash = crypto.createHash('sha512').update(salted, 'utf-8');

    for (var i = 1; i < 5000 ; i++) {
        hash = crypto.createHash('sha512').update(hash.digest('binary')+salted);
    }

    return hash.digest('base64');
};

People always compare between BCrypt and PBKDF2 and say that BCrypt is better because it is for example slower to use GPU, but they ignore the Rounds value, espetially when i talk about Python, where BCrypt is not powerful, so my question is simple:
The tests used the excellent python library Passlib
is it worth to use BCrypt even with small round value? in Passlib, the default value is 12, tested and gave me 0.40 seconds,  while PBKDF2 gave me with the default value which is 12000 rounds: 0.142 seconds
so for example, if i use BCrypt with only 5 rounds, i'll say: hey, my application is more secure -and faster- than using PBKDF2 with 12000 rounds! (it seems dumb i know, sorry).
here is the benchmark results
","Note that the actual number of iterations in bcrypt is 2^rounds, so for example rounds=5 -> iterations=32, and the default rounds=12 -> iterations=4096.  When comparing between bcrypt and pbkdf2, make sure that they mean the same thing when they say ""rounds"".

","A file can be ""secure"" only if you define what you mean by ""secure"".
Usually, you will be interested in two properties:

Confidentiality: the data that is encrypted shall remain unreadable to attackers; revealing the plaintext data requires knowledge of a specific secret.
Integrity: any alteration of the data should be reliably detected; attackers shall not be able to modify the data in any way (even ""blindly"") without the modification being noticed by whoever decrypts the data.

Your piece of code, apparently, fulfils confidentiality (to some extent) but not integrity. Your string called ""integrity"" is a misnomer: it is not an integrity check. Its role is apparently to detect accidental password mistakes, not attacks; thus, it would be less confusing if that string was called passwordVerifier instead. An attacker can alter any bit beyond the first 48 bits without the decryption process noticing anything.
Adding integrity (the genuine thing) requires the use of a MAC. Combining encryption and a MAC securely is subject to subtleties; therefore, it is recommended to use for encryption and MAC an authenticated encryption mode which does both, and does so securely (i.e. that specific combination was explicitly reviewed by hordes of cryptographers). Usual recommended AE modes include GCM and EAX.
An important point to note is that, in a context where integrity matters, data cannot be processed before having been verified. This has implications for big files: if your huge file is adorned with a single MAC (whether ""manually"" or as part of an AE mode), then you must first verify the complete file before beginning to do anything with the plaintext data. This does not work well with streamed processing (e.g. if playing a huge video). A workaround is to split the data into individual chunks, each with its own MAC, but then some care must be taken about the ordering of chunks (attackers could try to remove, duplicate or reorder chunks): things become complex. Complexity, on a general basis, is bad for security.
There are contexts where integrity does not matter. For instance, if your attack model is ""the attacker steals the laptop"", then you only have to care about confidentiality. However, if the attack model is ""the attacker steals the laptop, modifies a few files, and puts it back in my suitcase without me noticing"", then integrity matters: the attacker could plant a modification in the file, and infer parts of the secret itself based on your external behaviour when you next access the file.
For confidentiality, you use CFB, which is a bit old-style, but not wrong. For the password-to-key transform, you use PBKDF2, which is fine; the iteration count, though, is quite low: you use 256. Typical values are 20000 or more. The theory is that you should make actual performance measures to set this count to as high a value as you can tolerate: a higher value means slower processing, both for you and for the attacker, so you ought to crank that up (depending on your patience).

Mandatory warning: you are in the process of defining your own crypto, which is a path fraught with perils. Most people who do that produce weak systems, and that includes trained cryptographers; in fact, being a trained cryptographer does not mean that you know how to define a secure protocol, but rather that you know better than defining your own protocol. You are thus highly encouraged to rely on an existing protocol (or format), rather than making your own. I suggest OpenPGP, with (for instance) GnuPG as support library. Even if you need for some reason (e.g. licence issues) to reimplement the format, using a standard format is still a good idea: it avoids introducing weaknesses, it promotes interoperability, and it can be tested against existing systems.

The hash generated in C#:
1G84mPkY78nsQ2BzO/qUPd+e0Lobrz7ZLzc+p7Zh0o8=

My C# test code is as follows:
public const int HASH_BYTE_SIZE = 32; 
public const int PBKDF2_ITERATIONS = 1000;

public static string HashPassword(string password, string salt)
        {
            byte[] passwordBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(password);
            byte[] saltBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(salt);

            var pbkdf2 = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(passwordBytes, saltBytes, PBKDF2_ITERATIONS);
            var hash = pbkdf2.GetBytes(HASH_BYTE_SIZE);

            return Convert.ToBase64String(hash);
        }

static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string salt = ""GJNw/wzXZxEdXrheqo322mf0x+92AeAuAHH48iiGZ+A="";
            string plainTextPsw = ""12345"";

            string hashedPsw = PasswordHash.HashPassword(plainTextPsw, salt);

            Console.WriteLine(hashedPsw);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }

And NodeJs:
var crypto = require('crypto');
var iterations = 1000;
var bytes = 32;

exports.createSalt = function () {
    return new Buffer(crypto.randomBytes(bytes)).toString('base64');
}

exports.hash = function hash(text, salt, callback) {
    crypto.pbkdf2(text, salt, iterations, bytes, function (err, derivedKey) {
        if (err) { callback(err); }
        else {
            var h = new Buffer(derivedKey).toString('base64');
            callback(null, h);
        }
    });
}

","There are some bad conversions occurring in the Node.js code that produce an invalid result.
First, the ""salt"" passed to the pbkdf2 function should be the random bytes, without any transformation applied. However, in this case, the bytes are encoded with Base64 to text, and the characters in that text are used by Node.js as the salt.
Then, the derived key should be encoded directly to text with Base64. But here, the bytes of the key are treated as characters; this character string is converted to a new string of different bytes using UTF-8 encoding. This encoding is then encoded with Base64 to produce the final, incorrect result.

The first option is to transition the users to a new hashing scheme (Salt + Scrypt or PBKDF2 HMACSHA256) when they login and deactivate old users after a certain period of time so they have to use the password recovery feature which would automatically update their hash.
Another option that would allow me to instantly upgrade everyone would be to take the existing MD5 hashes, add a new random salt value to each, and then hash the result using the new hashing scheme (Salt + Scrypt or PBKDF2 HMACSHA256) and store that value to the database and delete the old value.
Then when users login, I would have to apply the old, and then the new method.  I like the second option better since it allows me to remove all the old insecure hashes from the database sooner than later.
Is it secure to salt and rehash the existing hashes?  Is MD5 so broken that I can run a script to de-hash the passwords and rehash them using the new scheme?
Or maybe the best solution is to do a combination of both options?  This way I don't have to leave the existing MD5 hashes unsecured in the database and I can migrate users to the new system for a period of time?
","MD5 is not so broken that you can de-hash all the passwords easily, but assuming the quality of the passwords isn't too good then you could probably brute force them and convert them to the new, more secure format.  The brokenness of MD5 results from it's relatively small length (more collision surface) and it's computationally simple calculation (meaning brute force attacks are more feasible than algorithms that have larger run-time complexity such as SHA2)
If I were you I'd do both methods you listed (because as you mentioned, getting the passwords moved over quickly is important in case your DB is hacked).  First I would brute force all the brute forcible MD5 passwords and convert them to the new format.  I have done this in the past, and by far the best results have been using HashCat (the Cuda or OCL flavors preferably since they use the GPU and are 200 times faster).  If Hashcat is too difficult (the learning curve can be steep), then try John the Ripper.  It is a lot slower than HashCat but it's a lot easier to use.
For the passwords that you can't crack, expire the user's account and have them reset the password.  Or to be nicer to your users, just update the password in the database to the new format the next time they log in by sending both hashes.  If the MD5 checks out, then destroy it and replace it with the new format.  These are just some ideas.
EDIT:
Forgot to mention that if you want to just hash the MD5 passwords into the new format that would be just fine security-wise, though it adds another layer of complexity to your code, and where there is complexity there is room for implementation flaws.  Just something to think about.

","This is actually a very ingenious idea you had. Normally i would have:

waited until a user returned
realize that their stored password needs to be updated
now that i have their (known valid) password in memory: rehash it with the new algorithm
store the new hash in the database

The downside to only having used MD5 is that it's easy to bruteforce. By (temporarily) treating the MD5 result as an intermediate step before applying the real scrypt/Argon2, you thwart bruteforcing attempts.
Using a fast hash algorithm as a pre-processing step before the ""real"" password hash is not unheard of - and can even be useful.

BCrypt has a known password length limitation of 72 bytes (71 utf-8 characters and then a null terminator). Dropbox applies SHA2-512 to the incoming plaintext password before running it through bcrypt. By running a long password through a hash first, they overcome the 71 character limit.
Not only does this overcome the password length limitation (avoiding having to truncate or limit the password size), but it can prevent a Denial of Service attack when someone supplies an extraordinarily long password. BCrypt and Scrypt are suseptible to attacks with longer passwords (i don't know about Argon2).

So there can be a virtue in using a pre-hash (although not necessarily MD5).
I don't know how you're currently storing the MD5 hashes. MD5 is 128-bit. Assuming you store it in Base64, you can easily recognize it:

MD5: nMKuihunqT2jm0b8EBnEgQ==

The desired final goal is something like scrypt:

MD5: nMKuihunqT2jm0b8EBnEgQ==
scrypt: $s0$e0801$epIxT/h6HbbwHaehFnh/bw==$7H0vsXlY8UxxyW/BWx/9GuY7jEvGjT71GFd6O4SZND0=

So when validating credentials against a saved hash, you can figure out which hash it is and use the appropriate algorithm. Your intermediate step, which adds the computational complexity, is defining your own format for:

MD5 + scrypt

something like:

MD5: nMKuihunqT2jm0b8EBnEgQ==
MD5 + scrypt: $md5s0$e0801$eX8cPtmLjKSrZBJszHIuZA==$vapd0u4tYVdOXOlcIkFmrOEIr1Ml2Ue1l2+FVOJgbcI=
scrypt: $s0$e0801$epIxT/h6HbbwHaehFnh/bw==$7H0vsXlY8UxxyW/BWx/9GuY7jEvGjT71GFd6O4SZND0=

Now you recognize the algorithm being used based on the saved hash, and can upgrade passwords in pieces.

        }

    }

But now the problem is, the hashed output of my program for the same password is different from the MySQL database's. For instance, for the password as ""test"", my program gives this output (after converting the output byte to string):
?7??ZyG?<#?b??H??C?0z?'#?G?)?Ht\r5_[?% y

while the MySQL output is this one (as mentioned above):
H/U3ioBaeUeYPCP2YqLwpkjI40PoMHqeJyPORz8prUg=

So it says the provided password is incorrect even to a correct password. I guessed maybe my program's output is hexidecimal, so I tried to convert the both my final result with MySQL string to hexidecimal by this: 
string hexDbPassword = BitConverter.ToString(dbPasswordByte);
string hexHashedPassword = BitConverter.ToString(hashedPasswordByte);

The result is this (again not the same):
hexDbPassword = 48-2F-55-33-69-6F-42-61-65-55-65-59-50-43-50-32-59-71-4C-77-70-6B-6A-49-34-30-50-6F-4D-48-71-65-4A-79-50-4F-52-7A-38-70-72-55-67-3D    
hexHashedPassword = 1F-F5-37-8A-80-5A-79-47-98-3C-23-F6-62-A2-F0-A6-48-C8-E3-43-E8-30-7A-9E-27-23-CE-47-3F-29-AD-48-02-74-0D-35-0E-5F-5B-02-DC-25-20-79

I'm using the following Java implementation to generate the hash with a random byte array which is 16 bytes in size. I'm then storing the hash and salt separately in a MySQL database, however when I go to do the same operation in PHP using the salt retrieved from the database, I get almost the exact same encryption except the hash has a leading 0 and I cannot for the life of me figure out why.
Java:
public String hashPassword(String password, byte[] salt){

 char[] passwordChars = password.toCharArray();

     PBEKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(
         passwordChars,
         salt,

    }

        // TODO Auto-generated catch block
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
     return String.format(""%x"", new BigInteger(hashedPassword));

}

I found the above code at https://adambard.com/blog/3-wrong-ways-to-store-a-password/
PHP:
$query = $database->query('SELECT * FROM USERS');

$password = 'hello';
$iterations = 1000;

foreach($query as $user){
    $hash = hash_pbkdf2(""sha1"", $password, $user['salt'], $iterations, 40, false);

}
echo $hash;

Note: There is only one user stored in the database, I know the above code isn't great, I created it quickly for testing purposes.
For both implementations I'm using an iteration count of 1000, a key length of 160 in Java and a key length of 40 in PHP (to compensate for setting raw-output to false)
Java Output - 971f0dddc1bc2e899f2bca178f16ea79bfbbb13
PHP Output - 0971f0dddc1bc2e899f2bca178f16ea79bfbbb13

Any help is much appreciated, thank you.
","It is the BigInteger that is killing the leading 0.
Hashes are not integers, they are an array of 8-bit bytes. Do not try to convert to a BigInteger.
Either use it as a byte[] or encode as a hexadecimal or Base64 string. To match PHP hexadecimal encode hashedPassword.
PHP is returning a hexadecimal string encoded hash because raw_output is set to FALSE.

I see that with the same salt and password it give me a different encryption.
As far as I understand the SecretKeyFactory methods depend only on the inputs I give them, or do they depend on the machine I am running on as well?
If so, how can I save a default password for first installation with this security mechanism without running any extra code during installation?
Thank You!
","I think the problem may be in different default String encodings.
Check that your strings use same encoding.
you can try to check bytes using 
salt.getBytes()


it return bytes in default encoding, may be machines has different encodings.

You can just replace salt.getBytes(), with somethink like salt.getBytes(""UTF-8""); may be it will help.

"16389790","Add salt to pycrypto KDF - useful?","I have noted some sources indicate that when using a KDF like PBKDF2 some advocate injecting the salt at the time of execution - like this:
dv = salt + PBKDF2(salt + password, salt)

Versus the ""plain"" usage of
dv = PBKDF2(password, salt)

When using the PyCrypto.Protocol.KDF PBKDF2 function (linked above), do the extra salt parameters add any benefit if no two passwords will have the same salt (but the salt will be stored with the password)?
Presumably the risk is having an oracle whereby identical passwords would be revealed as-such, encoded. Is this the case or is there another concern one ought to be mindful of?
If this is the only concern I would expect, in the absence of a fault in the algorithms that permits short-circuiting, a plainly used salt obliges one to recheck every password the entire number of iterations. Is this the case?

"35472403","Why PBKDF2 SHA256 generated hash value not equal between C and java","I have a Android client and Server, the client needs to validate the session key before communication or processing data with the server. The client was Android app and its encryption method was wrote in Java, the server`s was wrote in C.
I call the session key as ""magic token"", and the magic token is generated by PBKDF2 algorithm with 1000 iterations of SHA256 hash on server. The client fetch the magic token from server and the client itself needs to regenerate the magic token again in order to compare the fetched one and generated one. if they are equal, means the session key is valid and the client can go further operations. 
But my problem is when I trying to generate the magic token using the same algorithm, salt, iteration count with server side, the generated hash value are not the same. Maybe it caused by PBKDF2 algorithm or sha256 are not exactly same for different platforms. I feel really confused and anyone can help me find out where the error comes from?

","Apparently, it seems the IBM Java implementation of PBKDF2 insists the password must not be empty. When it is, the implementation throws an exception.
Empty passwords are arguably an edge case, however, the first test case was exactly that, so it seemed the code did not work at all. Also, while an edge case, you either need to ensure it never happens (validations requiring the user not to have empty password), or you should handle it gracefully.
If you really need to support empty passwords, you either need to handle them as a special case, or just normalize all passwords so that the input to PBKDF2 is never empty. However, you have to ensure you won’t compromise security that way.
In the end, we chose to prefix all passwords with their length, so that even the empty passwords ends being represented with a nonempty string. Like that:
final String prefixedPassword = String.format(Locale.ROOT, ""%08x%s"", password.length(), password);

"43636332","Will this CryptoJS AES encryption code produce secure output?","I believe that because the key passed to AES.encrypt is a string, the function will automatically generate an IV. So is the code below producing a well secured encrypted version of string_to_encrypt?
pass  = document.getElementById('pass').value; // user entered pwrd    salt  = 'some system determined salt';
its   = 9000 + getKeyIterationModifier(pass); // iterations depend on pass
key   = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(pass, salt, { keySize: 512/32, iterations: its });

encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(string_to_encrypt, key.toString());

Or should I be adding 'mode' and 'padding' values to harden it further? If so, what are the current industry standard values?
In other words, should I ideally be using something like the following (perhaps without the iv if that's done automatically) and if so what's ideal:
key = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(key);
encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(string_to_encrypt, key, {
    iv: iv, 
    mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC, 
    padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
});

","CryptoJS.AES.encrypt uses EVP_BytesToKey to expand the passed ""key"" (considered a password) to an actual AES-256 key and IV if the ""key"" was a string. It uses a random salt for that, so the ciphertext is randomized. In your second snippet, you need to handle the IV yourself.
What you're essentially asking is whether EVP_BytesToKey is a secure password expansion function. That's not something that can be easily answered. The fact that it uses MD5 means that the first snippet has at least the security of AES-128 which should be good.
The other issue is that the IV should be unpredictable (read: random) for absolutely every encryption. Don't use a static IV, because that makes the cipher deterministic and therefore not semantically secure. An attacker who observes ciphertexts can determine when the same message prefix was sent before. This suggestion is a given in the first snippet, but you would have to work for that realization in the second snippet which might introduce other issues.
If you're not comfortable with CryptoJS and cryptography, go with the first snippet. Otherwise, try to improve the second snippet.

Security considerations:
If you're using only symmetric encryption in the browser you need the exact same key at the server and the client. If you send the encryption key from the server to the client or the other way around you need to encrypt your symmetric encryption key. The easiest way to do this would be to use TLS. If you use TLS, then the data as well as key are encrypted, so you don't need to encrypt it yourself. This doesn't provide any security, just a little bit of obfuscation. You should read: https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2011/august/javascript-cryptography-considered-harmful/
You should think about integrating authenticated encryption through an authenticated mode like GCM or EAX, or through the use of an encrypt-then-MAC scheme with a strong MAC like HMAC-SHA256.

","Using the username as a salt is mostly satisfying, but does not protect against several attack scenarios. As for example, the password can be compared in the databases of two websites that use the same algorithm. Furthermore, rainbow tables can be generated in advance, hence reducing the cracking time after compromise.
For this exact reason, the salt should be generated using a cryptographic PRNG. The idea of having the source code of the random source visible to attackers isn't a problem in itself, if it is non-predictable. See this question for how to generate it using javascript.

","What is wrong with simply using a random salt?  Other than your method doesn't require the salt to be stored with hashed password, I can't think of any advantages.
A hash of the username and password concatenated together should be okay.  Since the password is secret the hash of the username and password will be unpredictable.  However, as others have mentioned, there could be a security issue if there are two websites using the same algorithm, and someone using those websites uses the same credentials for both (i.e. looking at their hashed passwords we can tell they use the same password for each website).  Adding the domain of your site should get around this.  For example (+ is concatenation):

salt = hash(domain + username + password)

All of that being said, I would strongly recommend using a cryptographic random number generator to generate your salt since it's the standard practice for salt generation.

Kindly give me some helpful guidelines on this.
Thanks,

","Rfc2898DeriveBytes is a streaming-response object, so concatenating two successive calls is the same as doing one call with both lengths added together.
var pbkdf2WithTwoCalls = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(...)
var pbkdf2WithOneCall = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(sameParametersAsAbove);

byte[] twoCallA = pbkdf2WithTwoCalls.GetBytes(32);
byte[] twoCallB = pbkdf2WithTwoCalls.GetBytes(16);

byte[] oneCall = pbkdf2WithOneCall.GetBytes(32 + 16);

if (!oneCall.SequenceEquals(twoCallA.Concat(twoCallB))
    throw new TheUniverseMakesNoSenseException();

So your solution in Python would be to make one 48-byte call to PBKDF2, then split it into the 32-byte AES key and the 16-byte IV.
Your decryption response indicates that the key is correct, but the IV is not.

"30515662","How can I generate the same secure hash in Java and Ruby using PBKDF2","I am porting a web application from Ruby to Java and would like to allow the users to log in without resetting their passwords. Here is the Ruby code that generates the hash using the pbkdf2 gem:
PBKDF2.new { |p|
  p.password = password
  p.salt = salt
  p.iterations = 10000
}.hex_string

Reading the source for the Ruby gem, it is using OpenSSL::Digest.new(""sha256"") as the default hashing function and generates a value of 32 bytes, which converts to a 64 character string using 'unpack(""H*"")'.
So, in Java I tried the following:
public String generatePasswordHash(String password, String salt) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException
{
    char[] chars = password.toCharArray();
    byte[] saltBytes =salt.getBytes();

    PBEKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(chars, saltBytes, 1000, 256);
    SecretKeyFactory skf = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256"");
    byte[] hash = skf.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();
    BigInteger bi = new BigInteger(1, hash);
    return bi.toString(16);
}

Testing both pieces of code with password = ""apassword"" and salt = ""somesalt"", I get the following results.
Ruby: 3fa1eb7544ca49b1f371eb17d24bf0010c433fa263a84aff7df446741371706b

Java: 77a7c0b1ea9760d0b1ef02e7a2633c40ccd7848ee4fa822ec71b5794e476f354

I tested the Ruby and Java hex string encoding and they work the same so the problem looks to be in the hashing algorithm or perhaps the way the Strings are converted to byte arrays.
","The problem is in the number of iterations. If you change it to 10,000 in Java instead of the 1,000 you are using, it will give you an identical result to the one you got in Ruby:
    PBEKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(chars, saltBytes, 10000, 256);

Additional notes:
It's always best to ensure that bytes are taken from a string according to a known character set. Without the character set, it uses whatever the default character set is, and it may cause surprises.
Also, it's best not to rely on BigInteger.toString(16), because if the first few bytes are 0, it will return a string that is shorter than 64 characters. Use String.format() instead:
public static String generatePasswordHash(String password, String salt) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException
{
    char[] chars = password.toCharArray();
    byte[] saltBytes =salt.getBytes(StandardCharsets.US_ASCII);

    PBEKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(chars, saltBytes, 10000, 256);
    SecretKeyFactory skf = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256"");
    byte[] hash = skf.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();
    BigInteger bi = new BigInteger(1, hash);
    return String.format(""%064x"", bi);
}

(I assumed the salt is in plain ASCII text. You can change the character set, but keep in mind to use the same character set Ruby uses).

","You have to use the same algorithm on both sides. In Java you're using simply SHA-256 and in node you're using PBKDF2 with SHA-256. 
Node.js' crypto module provides the createHash(algorithm) function. Where you can specify SHA-256 directly. PBKDF2 is an algorithm that only uses different hashing functions under the hood. 
If you want hash passwords, then it is much safer to use PBKDF2 with a lot of iterations (> 86,000) and a random salt that you store alongside the password hash.
Java has support for PBKDF2 in its standard library.
If you really want to use SHA-256 directly and I strongly advise against it, you can use the following code:
var crypto = require('crypto');
var key = ""123"";

UPDATE
OpenJDK issue: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8191177
","It was indeed a JDK bug in the PBKDF2KeyImpl.getEncoded() method.
More details in the bug report https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8191177 and the related issue https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8191002.
It has been fixed and shipped within the Java January 2018 CPU release.
UPDATE: This has been fixed for JDK 9 and later by the use of a reachabilityFence().
Because of the lack of this fence in the ealier version of JDK you should use a workaround: « as first discovered by Hans Boehm, it just so happens that one way to implement the equivalent of reachabilityFence(x) even now is ""synchronized(x) {}"" »
In our case, the workaround is:
SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(pbkdf2Algorithm);
KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(passphrase.toCharArray(), salt.getBytes(charset), iterationCount, keyStrength);
SecretKey secret = factory.generateSecret(spec);
SecretKeySpec key;
//noinspection SynchronizationOnLocalVariableOrMethodParameter
synchronized(secret) {
  key = new SecretKeySpec(secret.getEncoded(), keyAlgorithm);

","
I'm writing a program which hashes passwords with the pbkdf2 method using cryptopp.

You linked to the Crypto++ main page, and not a your particular use of PBKDF. Here's some code just in case (it uses the IETF test vectors from RFC 6070):
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    byte password[] =""password"";
    size_t plen = strlen((const char*)password);

    byte salt[] = ""salt"";
    size_t slen = strlen((const char*)salt);

    int c = 1;
    byte derived[20];

    PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC<CryptoPP::SHA1> pbkdf2;
    pbkdf2.DeriveKey(derived, sizeof(derived), 0, password, plen, salt, slen, c);

    string result;

    encoder.Put(derived, sizeof(derived));
    encoder.MessageEnd();

    cout << ""Derived: "" << result << endl;

    return 0;
}



I have tried to compare the output in ""length-constant"" time but it always fails and returns false. 

Crypto++ has a constant time compare built in. Use VerifyBufsEqual from misc.h. The source is available in misc.cpp.
$ cd cryptopp
$ grep -R VerifyBufsEqual *
cryptlib.cpp:   return VerifyBufsEqual(digest, digestIn, digestLength);
default.cpp:    if (!VerifyBufsEqual(check, check+BLOCKSIZE, BLOCKSIZE))
fipstest.cpp:   if (!VerifyBufsEqual(expectedModuleMac, actualMac, macSize))
fipstest.cpp:   if (VerifyBufsEqual(expectedModuleMac, actualMac, macSize))
misc.cpp:bool VerifyBufsEqual(const byte *buf, const byte *mask, size_t count)
misc.h:CRYPTOPP_DLL bool CRYPTOPP_API VerifyBufsEqual(const byte *buf1, const byte *buf2, size_t count);
pssr.cpp:   valid = VerifyBufsEqual(representative + representativeByteLength - u, hashIdentifier.first, hashIdentifier.second) && valid;
pubkey.cpp: return VerifyBufsEqual(representative, computedRepresentative, computedRepresentative.size());
secblock.h:     return m_size == t.m_size && VerifyBufsEqual(m_ptr, t.m_ptr, m_size*sizeof(T));

What I'm not clear about: VerifyBufsEqual is predicated upon buffers of equal lengths. I'm not sure if its OK to overlook the ""not-equal length"" case.

There's also a question on the Information Stack Exchange that may be relevant: Timing attacks on password hashes. But I'm not certain if/how it generalizes to arbitrary buffer compares.
The question piqued my interest in an answer to the general problem (the question has always been there): Constant time compares when array sizes are not equal?. That should tell us if  we have the proper tools in VerifyBufsEqual (Crypto++), CRYPTO_memcmp (OpenSSL), etc.

","
Does it mean it must consist of printable characters only?

NO.
If its a binary password, then that means you have to specify its length in passlen. You can't set passlen to -1 because strlen won't work as expected.


Can I use binary password instead?

YES.
Be sure to specify the length in passlen.


Does it mean I can use a binary password being encoded as a hex string?

YES.
There's no difference between raw octets, Hex encoding, Base32 encoding or Base64 encoding. They are presentation formats, and they all have the same entropy. The entropy will be extracted by the derivation functions.
The different encodings will result in different derived keys, but all the derived keys will have the same amount of entropy.

Then you'll have (nearly) the newest version of Rfc2898DeriveBytes that has a constructor that accepts as a parameter HashAlgorithmName.SHA256.

"50796527","PBKDF2 using SHA 256 in .NET","I need to update some code that is using the PBKDF2 implementation in .Net, Rfc2898DeriveBytes to hash user credentials. 
It is my understanding that this function uses SHA-1 under the hood. I need to update the underlying hashing algorithm of the systems password hashing to use SHA-256 (This is a client IT-SEC requirement). 
Having done some reading it seems it is best practice to continue to to use a Key derivation function, however PBKDF2 doesn't allow you to dictate the algorithm is should use, which is obviously a problem for me.
Our system is using .NET 4.5.1 and currently is not an option to upgrade that and I am reasonably confident it is not an option to reference any new .NET core .dlls that I've heard contain a new implementation of PBKDF2 that allows you to specify your algorithm.
I want to avoid home made implementations at all cost,s as that's the 1st rule of Crypto-Club right?
Any guidance on what is best practice would be appreciated.

"38519807","Password hashing using PBKDF2 and HKDF in .NET","I've been tasked with the task of writing a new method for computing password hashes to replace the old one which we do not feel is sufficiently secure yet. A good while ago, I read the book Security Driven .NET, in which I learned that the important part is to use a algorithm with configurable amount of revolutions (as opposed to a simple hash), and that in .NET the recommended one was called PBKDF2 for password handling. I also read that as an improvement to how ASP.NET deals with passwords, it would be nice if the resulting hash stored in the database was cryptographically tied to the user (either name or id) by way of using the PBKDF2 to create a master key, and then use the username (or id) to create a derived key using HKDF. But again, this is superficial knowledge that I read from a book that I do not currently have access to, so I can't recheck if my memory is correct.
Also, I've not used the .NET DerivedBytes APIs before, so I might be doing that wrong. So my question is this: Am I doing things right in the following code? Am I using the APIs correctly? And is this implementation ""sufficiently secure""? Or am I doing something wrong which completely removes all of the security?
protected override byte[] ComputeHash(string user, string salt, string password)
{
    var userBytes = user.ToBytes();
​
    using (var pbkdf2 = new PBKDF2(MacFactories.HMACSHA512, password.ToBytes(), salt.ToBytes()))
    {
        var masterKey = pbkdf2.GetBytes(128);
        using (var hkdf = new HKDF(MacFactories.HMACSHA512, masterKey, userBytes, userBytes))
        {
            return hkdf.GetBytes(64);
        }
    }
}

","You have the correct idea/approach - here is a slightly better implementation:
byte[] ComputeHash(string user, string salt, string password)
{
    using (var pbkdf2 = new PBKDF2(HMACFactories.HMACSHA512, password, salt.ToBytes()))
    using (var hkdf = new HKDF(HMACFactories.HMACSHA512, pbkdf2.GetBytes(64), user.ToBytes()))
        return hkdf.GetBytes(64);
}

You should not ask pbkdf2 for more bytes than the byte-length of the underlying PRF (in your case, SHA512 which produces 64 bytes).
You can leave hkdf context as null since you don't seem to have a need for it.
For others who might be wondering what library the above code uses - Inferno crypto.

This is still not your answer, but now we can easily see it is 64 hex characters => 32 bytes.
You asked for 20 bytes.
It also looks like your salt input is base64, but the function you're passing it to expects ... whatever the output of base64_decode is.

So, you need to consistently process the base64-encoded data.  And then you'll need to make sure that your hash algorithm, iteration count, and output byte count all match what the perl script says.

Obviously, PHP's hash_pbkdf2() accepts the hash algorithm as a parameter, but the potentially tricky differences are these:

It doesn't comply with RFC 2898 in that its length is applied after hex-encoding, so that last parameter must be set to true to make it consistent with the spec.
It accepts the output length in bytes instead of bits (hence why we divide by 8 above).

The only thing I'm not sure about is what key.getEncoded() does in your sample code ... there's no encoding algorithm specified anywhere.
I found some docs suggesting it is supposed to be RAW, so the example I'm providing should match it. If it doesn't, you'll have to encode it yourself.

My knowledge of ruby is basic, and I don't know Ruby on Rails.  From what I have figured out, starting with their user.rb model, Gitlab uses a module called Devise to generate the authentication token.  Looking at the Devise  token_generator.rb module, it seems that the default is a PBKDF2 SHA1 hash with a SHA256 digest, but I also don't know how the configuration file is processed.
The KeyGenerator class is self contained and I am able to duplicate it in another language. But the TokenGenerator class is going to take me a while to figure out without learning some Ruby on Rails:
  class TokenGenerator
    def initialize(key_generator, digest=""SHA256"")
      @key_generator = key_generator
      @digest = digest
    end

    def digest(klass, column, value)
      value.present? && OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(@digest, key_for(column), value.to_s)
    end

    def generate(klass, column)
      key = key_for(column)

      loop do
        raw = Devise.friendly_token
        enc = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(@digest, key, raw)

I realize I'm being lazy and impatient, but I was hoping somebody familiar with Gitlab and Ruby on Rails could help me find out:

Where in this rails app does TokenGenerator.generate get called
for the user creation, and what are the default klass and column
values being passed to it?
Where is ""Devise #{column}"" read from, and what is its default value?

In other words, I would like to know what parameters supplied by the users end up as factors to this authentication token.  The plain text password? The encrypted password?  Just a random value?

The pbeParamSpecKey need to be the same? How much is ""important"" (in terms of security) the number of iterations generating the key and the one generating the Cipher object?

This is a hard question that you need to answer yourself. The general guidance is, as large as possible without annoying the user too much, but 1000 iterations is a bit low nowadays.
The next thing you need to do is try to benchmark your application on different devices that your user group probably has. Then you can fine-tune accordingly. 
Maybe you can slightly redesign your app so that the key derivation happens in the background during idle phases and can therefore take a longer time. Though, this may introduce other problems like keeping the derived key safe and not leakable. 

Can they be different?

AES is a symmetric block cipher and as such needs the same key for encryption and decryption. To generate the same key, you need to use the same password, salt and number of iterations for PBKDF2.

I have tried to solution mentioned in the post but still cannot figure out the problem with my code:

The output string in both codes is base64 encoded.
Can anyone point out what is wrong with this code?
Thanks!
","The reason that the output looks different is that the input to Base64 is different; the reason for that is that in the JavsScript code, you've called
key.toString()

So, in JavaScript, you have base64-encoded the 64-character string
""00d7a91fdf03a991ed324915ac893f08d99fca454f7c4169a1ac763c5f33e64f""

And jn Objective-C, you have base64-encoded the raw 32-byte sequence
0x00 0xd7 0xa9 0x1f 0xdf ... 0xe6 0x4f

In both cases, your PBKDF2 code has come up with the same key. You have just encoded the key differently in each case.
You can get CryptoJS to create the same Base64 output by serializing the key directly, like this:
key.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64)

(See https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/#The_Hasher_Output for the documentation. You may have to include another script file for this output format to be available)

","There is kind of a ""bug"" in the code around web2py.
The hash LOOKS like a hex string, but it is sent to the hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac (a proxy to openssl's method) as just the character representation of the hex string. Meaning you should not use
byte[] salt = fromHex(parts[1]);

but
byte[] salt = parts[1].getBytes(""utf-8"");

In addition, you need to pass the KEYLENGTH instead of the salt length into PBEKeySpec's contructor.
The corrected part should read:
byte[] salt = parts[1].getBytes(""utf-8"");
byte[] hash = fromHex(parts[2]);
PBEKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(originalPassword.toCharArray(), salt, 1000, 20*8);

Replace that and the code works. It took a while to find this out ;)

"19961299","PBKDBF2 hash - duplicating functionality of .NET rfc2898DerivedBytes class in PHP","I have a .NET web site built using MVC that has a user-management module. This module generates user passwords hashed conforming to the RFC2898 spec and stores them in a db. The specific implementation I'm using is the quick and convenient method found in System.Web.Helpers.Crypto.HashPassword().
Looking at the source code for that method as found here, it is wrapping a call to the Rfc2898DeriveBytes class, which actually creates the hash.
So far so good. The problem I'm facing is that we have a web service written in PHP that must do the actual user authentication. This means it must be able to receive a raw password from a user and generate the same hash. 
The NET Crypto.HashPassword() function creates a base64 encoded string that contains the salt as well as the key. We are correctly (I think) extracting this data in the below PHP implementation so the salt input should be the same. 
Both implementations also perform 1000 iterations.
Our PHP implementation:
    function hashtest(){ 
               //password from user
                $pass = ""Welcome4"";

                //hash generated by Crypto.HashPassword()
                $hashed_pass = ""AP4S5RIkCIT1caoSUocllccY2kXQ5UUDv4iiPCkEELcDK0fhG7Uy+zD0y0FwowI6hA=="";

                $decode_val = base64_decode($hashed_pass);
                echo ""<br/>Decoded value is: "".$decode_val;
                echo ""<br/>Length of decoded string is: "".strlen($decode_val);

                $salt = substr($decode_val, 1, 16);
                $key = substr($decode_val, 17, 49);
                echo ""<br/>Salt is: "".$salt.""<br/>Key is: "".$key;

                $result = $this->pbkdf2(""sha256"", $pass, $salt, 1000, 32, true);
                echo ""<br/>PBKDF2 result is: "".$result;

                if($key == $result)
                        echo ""<br/>MATCHED!"";
                else
                        echo ""<br/>NOT MATCHED"";

And the pbkdbf2 implementation:

                function pbkdf2($algorithm, $password, $salt, $count, $key_length, $raw_output = false){    

                    $algorithm = strtolower($algorithm);
                    if(!in_array($algorithm, hash_algos(), true))
                        die('PBKDF2 ERROR: Invalid hash algorithm.');
                    if($count <= 0 || $key_length <= 0)
                        die('PBKDF2 ERROR: Invalid parameters.'); 

                    $hash_length = strlen(hash($algorithm, """", true));
                    $block_count = ceil($key_length / $hash_length);

                    $output = """";

                    for($i = 1; $i <= $block_count; $i++) {
                        // $i encoded as 4 bytes, big endian.

                        $last = $salt . pack(""N"", $i);
                        // first iteration

                        $last = $xorsum = hash_hmac($algorithm, $last, $password, true);
                        // perform the other $count - 1 iterations

                        for ($j = 1; $j < $count; $j++) {
                            $xorsum ^= ($last = hash_hmac($algorithm, $last, $password, true));

                        }
                        $output .= $xorsum;

                    } 

                    if($raw_output)
                        return substr($output, 0, $key_length);

                        return bin2hex(substr($output, 0, $key_length));
                }

So my question is: Can anyone tell me if this PHP implementation supposed to generate the same output as the .NET Rfc2898DerivedBytes implementation? They are both supposedly conforming to RFC2898. 
I'm not a domain expert in this subject matter, so it's possible we're missing something obvious here..
Thanks in advance!
","1) Crypto.HashPassword() uses SHA1 and your PHP code uses SHA256.
2) The password needs to be UTF8-encoded (doesn't matter for plain latin passwords, but do it anyway).
Also, you $hashed_pass is incorrect (it does NOT correspond to ""Welcome4"" given the salt). Please, never do such things. It wasted a lot of my time. An example of real hash for Welcome4"" is ALtF3x2vx6u6gJIOm1MdTNwvL4yNBeKjuwscgkLgJUAI9TE2N8nYTjanAuXJjcqYpA==. Try it.
So, the correct call is:
$result = $this->pbkdf2(""sha1"", utf8_encode($pass), $salt, 1000, 32, true);

Case2:64765fbdada52d536d89bf2fac72b058397e9ec9

It's very strange since pw0 and pw1 are equal ""password"".toCharArray(). I wonder if there's a bug in String.toCharArray()??
","Technically, you call
""abc"".toCharArray().toString();

This will result in
[C@abcdef10

So what you'll get is always another value everytime you run it.
What you should do is:
jTextArea1.append(""\nCase1: ""+hashPassword(new String(pw0), ""salt""));

1. SHA-1 a password like ""pass123"", use the first 32 characters of the hexadecimal decoding for the key
2. Encrypt with AES-256 with just whatever the default parameters are
^Is that secure enough? 
I need my application to encrypt data with a password, and securely. There are too many different things that come up when I google this and some things that I don't understand about it too. I am asking this as a general question, not any specific coding language (though I'm planning on using this with Java and with iOS).
So now that I am trying to do this more properly, please follow what I have in mind:

Input is a password such as ""pass123"" and the data is
what I want to encrypt such as ""The bank account is 038414838 and the pin is 5931""
Use PBKDF2 to derive a key from the password. Parameters:
1000 iterations
length of 256bits
Salt - this one confuses me because I am not sure where to get the salt from, do I just make one up? As in, all my encryptions would always use the salt ""F"" for example (since apparently salts are 8bits which is just one character)
Now I take this key, and do I hash it?? Should I use something like SHA-256? Is that secure? And what is HMAC? Should I use that?
Note: Do I need to perform both steps 2 and 3 or is just one or the other okay?
Okay now I have the 256-bit key to do the encryption with. So I perform the encryption using AES, but here's yet another confusing part (the parameters).
I'm not really sure what are the different ""modes"" to use, apparently there's like CBC and EBC and a bunch of others
I also am not sure about the ""Initialization Vector,"" do I just make one up and always use that one?
And then what about other options, what is PKCS7Padding?

","For your initial points:

Using hexadecimals clearly splits the key size in half. Basically, you are using AES-128 security wise. Not that that is bad, but you might also go for AES-128 and use 16 bytes.
SHA-1 is relatively safe for key derivation, but it shouldn't be used directly because of the existence/creation of rainbow tables. For this you need a function like PBKDF2 which uses an iteration count and salt.

As for the solution:

You should not encrypt PIN's if that can be avoided. Please make sure your passwords are safe enough, allow pass phrases.
Create a random number per password and save the salt (16 bytes) with the output of PBKDF2. The salt does not have to be secret, although you might want to include a system secret to add some extra security. The salt and password are hashed, so they may have any length to be compatible with PBKDF2.
No, you just save the secret generated by the PBKDF2, let the PBKDF2 generate more data when required.
Never use ECB (not EBC). Use CBC as minimum. Note that CBC encryption does not provide integrity checking (somebody might change the cipher text and you might never know it) or authenticity. For that, you might want to add an additional MAC, HMAC or use an encryption mode such as GCM. PKCS7Padding (identical to PKCS5Padding in most occurences) is a simple method of adding bogus data to get N * [blocksize] bytes, required by block wise encryption.

Don't forget to prepend a (random) IV to your cipher text in case you reuse your encryption keys. An IV is similar to a salt, but should be exactly [blocksize] bytes (16 for AES).

I want the credentials to be universal but despite using Rfc2898DeriveBytes and the salt generated the first time I'm not able to get back to the same hashed password.

The obvious stuff is hash algorithm, salt, and iteration count. Can you confirm (for both languages):

the hash algorithm
the salt
the iteration count

The non-obvious is the encoding of the password and possibly salt. I included the salt because its often stored as a string.
To keep it portable among languages, you should use UTF-8. That's because you could encounter a default encoding, a UTF16-BE, UTF16-LE or any number of other encoding.
In C#, the setup would be:
byte[] utf8_salt = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(salt);
byte[] utf8_pass = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(password);

You would then pass utf8_salt and utf8_pass to the PBKDF2 function.
I don't know how to do the same in Javascript.

"43172914","Salt Length To Total Hash Length Ratio","I'm using KeyDerivation.Pbkdf2 to generate password hashes, and I was wondering what the general advice is regarding the salt length compared to the overall hash length that Pbkdf2 outputs.
In the implementation below, I'm using HMACSHA512, and assume that the salt is 512 bits, and that the hashBitLength is also 512 bits.
KeyDerivation.Pbkdf2(password, salt, KeyDerivationPrf.HMACSHA512, iterationCount, hashBitLength / 8);

I've seen an example which uses HMACSHA256, but it has the salt set to 128 bits and the overall hash bit length to 256.
Why would this approach be taken?
I've read that 512 bits is probably overkill, but in terms of storage, it doesn't concern me (I'm not sure how performance is impacted though, I haven't measured that).
Should the salt be the same length as the overall resulting hash.
Should it be half?
Or should it be anything above a certain threshold and below the overall length?
My gut says the way I'm doing it is correct (Aside from perhaps the 512 bit) as I suspect I'm getting maximum entropy, but I'm no cryptographer.
Could someone please clarify this for me?
","It really does not need to be that big, but let's understand why.  The purpose of the salt is:

If two people have the same passwords, then the 'hashed' result should not be the same.  
Prevent rainbow table attacks.

The first point can be accomplished by simply using a counter -- at least that prevents duplicates from your own database, but it might not prevent a hash of the password in your database from being the same as the hash of the same password in somebody else's database.  That brings us to the second point.
If one simply used a counter starting from zero, then one could construct a rainbow table based upon it.  The larger the salt, the more enormous that rainbow table would have to be to have a chance at being effective.  These tables grow exponentially with the salt size, so your salt really does not have to be that big to rule out this attack.
It's hard to point out exactly a minimum size, but I can assure you that 128-bits is more than enough.  I personally, as a security code auditor, would certainly not raise an issue with a salt as little as 64-bits. 
One of the big problems with security advice on this topic is that nobody has ever analysed it -- instead you just get blind recommendations from people who claim to be experts.  I wrote a paper on password processing making exactly this point.  Specifically see section 3 for my rant about salt.
Remark: to rule out rainbow tables altogether, don't use a counter.  Instead, choose your salts 'large enough' (as above) and in an unpredictable way.

","Author of the source code is a little bit paranoid. Timing attack is a theoretical attack, applicable only when it is possible to measure precise timing. And he states this on his blog. If you are using bcrypt or PBKDF2 for password hashing in any web-client application, the timing attack is practically impossible. The network latencies make much more grey noise to reponse timings than the string comparison procedure would do.
Since you should setup your password hashing to be slow for attacker, yet reasonable fast for user (say 200ms for one hash), the difference in string comparison is nearly unmeasurable on classic PC.
If you are still concerned by timing attack, you can always add a random sleep just before string comparison.

Typically you use a Content Encryption Key or CEK. The CEK is a random key, and you use it to key you block cipher and MAC that protects the file. Each file gets its own CEK and other crypto parameters, like and IV or nonce.
Then you use a Key Encryption Key or KEK. In you case, the KEK would be the output of you PBKDF. The KEK encrypts the CEK.
For recovery, you create a recovery key. Then you encrypt the CEK again under the recovery key, and move the encrypted CEK somewhere safe.
When it comes time to change passwords, you just re-encrypt the CEK under the new PBKDF derivation. No need to mess with the recovery key since its safe somewhere else. (Or as safe as it can be with governments issuing NSLs with no oversight).

I went through other post as well on stack regarding this issue but, it doesn't worked out as they have used different mode.
","In python, you're storing the iv (initialization vector) in the first 16 bytes of the encrypted message. 
In Java, you're doing no such thing - you're passing an empty IV and you treat the whole message including the first 16 bytes as ciphertext.
You need to make sure that Java and Python match up.
Either you don't use an IV in both, in which case you remove that part in Python. 
Or you use an IV in both, in which case you need to update your Java code to generate a random IV on encryption, adding it to the result of the encryption. On decryption, the Java code needs to take the first 16 bytes as the IV and pass it to the Cipher.

Basically, I would like to know what are appropriate values for the input pbkdf2.php (found here) considering the state of technology in 2012. What will give me a reasonable expectation that the passwords I encode will not be hackable by non governmental entities for the next few years?
Here is what I am considering:
define(""PBKDF2_HASH_ALGORITHM"", ""sha512"");
define(""PBKDF2_ITERATIONS"", 20000);
define(""PBKDF2_SALT_BYTES"", 512);
define(""PBKDF2_HASH_BYTES"", 512);

I understand that there are many other things that come into play to create good security. Here is a synopsis of other security measures I am using:

12 digit password with at least 2 numbers, 2 letters, and two symbols
required password changes every 6 months
php mysqli prepared statements for all database access
tokens on all my forms
5 second delay for incorrect logins,
blacklist after 10 incorrect logins from the same IP
incorrect logins and blacklist trigger the same response
HTTPS
I am using session and I change the session identifier every 10 pages
and on sensitive pages, every time the page is accessed.

Am I missing anything?
","Just as an example, the default settings for sha512crypt in most modern Linux distros ($6$ in /etc/shadow entries) uses 5000 iterations and 16 bytes of salt.  That is plenty slow.  But I'm not going to criticize you for overkill when it comes to hashing ;)

","There's no one right answer to this question because different applications call for different levels of security. The right thing to do is to benchmark your application, and use as high a setting as your server(s) can comfortably deal with in a responsive manner. (Under load tests, of course)
You're already much more secure than the average system just by implementing PBKDF2 in the first place rather than a ""fast"", ""message digest""-like algorithm, such as MD5 or SHA-1.

","If you want to convert binary data like a byte[] to a String you usually encode it to Hex or Base64 format. Base64 is smaller than hex, therefore I would recommend you to use this one.
For Base64 you can use java.util.Base64 since Java 8:
String base64encoded = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(getEncryptedPassword(p,s,i,l)));
For Hex AFAIR Java does not contain the necessary code. You can use e.g. the Hex encode from Apache common codec :
String hexEncoded = Hex.encodeHexString(getEncryptedPassword(p,s,i,l)));

","The password you're passing is a number?
If so:

Convert it to String.
If you don't want to do that, you can pass a Buffer object:


Pass a Buffer object using the class Method Buffer.from(string[, encoding])
https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_from_string_encoding

crypto.pbkdf2(Buffer.from(password, 'utf8'), salt, iterations, len, digest, function(err, derivedKey) {
    if (err) return fn(err);

});

However, the parameter ""iterations"" does not work as I expect it to. As the following simple code shows, when i try to call the function twice with one iteration, I get a different answer then when I call it once with two iterations. Since hashing functions are deterministic, both methods should yield the same result.
import hashlib

b=hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac(""sha256"",a,b""salt"",1)

Can someone tell me what went wrong?
","The 2nd iterations of PBKDF2 isn't just PBKDF2(the first iteration).
A simplified explanation is:

1 iteration: HMAC(password, salt || 00000001)
2 iterations: HMAC(password, HMAC(password, salt || 00000001))
PBKDF2(PBKDF2): HMAC(HMAC(password, salt || 00000001), salt || 00000001)

Note that the ""2 iterations"" and ""PBKDF2(PBKDF2)"" versions use different HMAC keys for the second computation, which is why they give different results.
As far as ""hashing functions are deterministic"": They are.  If you call them with the same inputs they give the same outputs.  You gave them different inputs, due to misunderstanding how the underlying algorithm works.

Rfc2898DeriveBytes now accepts a HashAlgorithmName in the constructor as of .NET Framework 4.7.2.
For older versions of .NET:
This is unfortunately just a limit of the implementation of Rfc2898DeriveBytes, it does not let you specify the hash function. SHA512 is probably overkill, and many would argue that SHA1 is still probably safe to use. However many people do use SHA256. You would have to find another implementation. Microsoft made another library called CLR Security that extends the System.Security.Cryptography namespace.
One of the things that it does do is use Microsoft's CNG API. It does offer an implementation of PBKDF2 that supports specifying the hash function, including SHA512. You can find it on Codeplex. The only downside to this is, it won't run on XP or Server 2003 since CNG was introduced in Windows Vista / Server 2008.

I read about hash collision but i dont understand it yet, so whats the proper length of salt and hash to have decent security?

Your salt should be fairly long. A good example might be the salt could be the same size as the output of the hash function, so with SHA512 you would use a 64 byte salt. Generally your salt should be a big enough value that it cannot easily be brute forced. It should also be random and not some ""user"" data, like the username.

This seems a good option:
https://defuse.ca/php-pbkdf2.htm
But then how about upgrading to PHP5.5 and using this?
http://php.net/manual/en/function.hash-pbkdf2.php
Curious as to why the PHP site states:

Caution
  The PBKDF2 method can be used for hashing passwords for storage (it is NIST approved for that use). However, it should be noted that CRYPT_BLOWFISH is better suited for password storage and should be used instead via crypt().

For PHP versions less that 5.5 would it be fair to use the defuse.ca solution, and then just switch it out after upgrading to PHP5.5?

This is the current solution from defuse.ca, would it be fair to rename this function to hash_pbkdf2() and after upgrading to PHP5.5 transition would be nice and smooth?
","The accepted best practice in PHP passwords, as of PHP 5.5, is password_hash.  It presents a single, unified, built-in, future-compatible way to generate a secure password hash.
If you are using a security-updated version of 5.3.x or higher, you can use the password_compat library instead.
Under the covers, the current version makes calls to crypt with some predefined security options.  Future versions may change the default options.
Please be sure to carefully read the section on the crypt page that talks about CRYPT_BLOWFISH versioning, as well as review the versioning notes on the password_compat page.  
As noted clearly in the warning message, PBKDF2 is accepted by the NIST as an adequate way to store passwords.  You can use implementations of it without significant concern, but you should only do so if you either need support for PHP versions prior to 5.3, or need to support PHP versions that have a broken CRYPT_BLOWFISH.

We have been doing a fair amount of reading on SHA-2, Bcrypt, PBKDF2, and Scrypt. That being said, we are not security experts or cryptographers, and a lot of the technical aspects of the subject matter goes over our heads.
At this point we are leaning toward implementing either PBKDF2 or Bcrypt.
However, we were curious as to whether or not there was a benefit to using a SHA-2 algorithm in concert with Bcrypt (it appears PBKDF2 already has to specify a hashing algorithm).
We had looked at the post:
https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/11552/would-it-make-sense-to-use-bcrypt-and-pbkdf2-together
But this is really more about using both Bcrypt and PBKDF2 together, and not a SHA-2.
Is there a benefit of leveraging a SHA-2 algorithm with Bcrypt? Or is it wasted effort/performance for no appreciable increase in actual security?

This function is called from our 'user model'. That model has an User.statics.register function what we can call. After a lot of debugging lines I have found out the code stops at (in my tested cases) crypto.pbkdf2(password, salt, ITERATIONS, len, DIGEST, function(err, derivedKey) in the else of the function. The log before this function show the content of the variables, but I can't see the logs in the function.
I have no idea, why this is stopped working. We have updated our node.JS version, but since this is an node module, that must be no problem.
Can somebody help me to solve this problem, so our users can register again? 
The mailservice, which you can see in the service, sends an email via Amazon SES, I think it is not relevant to post that code.

","Ultimately they are giving different outputs because you have given them different inputs.
Your Java output matches the result for
PBKDF2[HMACSHA1](UTF8(""1234""), HEX(""1234""), 1000, 16)

Your node.js output matches the result for
PBKDF2[HMACSHA1](UTF8(""1234""), UTF8(""1234""), 1000, 16)

The difference being that your salt in Java was { 0x12, 0x34 } and in node.js was { 0x31, 0x32, 0x33, 0x34 }.
Presumably you want new Buffer(salt, 'hex') (or, since that constructor is deprecated, Buffer.from(salt, 'hex')).

My problem is that it keeps generating the same derived keys for each call.
I am trying to decrypt the data that was encrypted on .Net side with the Rfc2898DeriveBytes:
var saltBytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(salt);
var key = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(Inputkey, saltBytes);

var aesAlg = new RijndaelManaged();
aesAlg.Key = key.GetBytes(aesAlg.KeySize / 8);   // default keySize 256
aesAlg.IV = key.GetBytes(aesAlg.BlockSize / 8);  // default blockSize 128

On the .Net side, the Rfc2898DeriveBytes returns new random set of bytes, but my Swift code is only generating for each call the same sequence.
What is wrong with that sequence generation on Swift side?
Edit1: When I used the bytes sequences of Key and IV generated by Rfc2898DeriveBytes from .net in Swift trying to decrypt the data encrypted in .net, then it works fine.
Edit2: Ok, I have found out that the first time the Rfc2898DeriveBytes works with GetBytes method is the same result as on the Swift PBKDF2 result. The second call GetBytes gives a completly different result. Why is that? If I will solution for this, then my decryption should work.
aesAlg.Key = key.GetBytes(aesAlg.KeySize / 8);   // (1) - the same result as in Swift implementation
aesAlg.IV = key.GetBytes(aesAlg.BlockSize / 8);  // (2) - completly different result

Am I initializing the IV in Swift wrongly?
","The .NET implementation is effectively a stream. To get an equivalent answer from the Apple version you should ask for the total bytes you need in one call, then split it up into whatever pieces you need.

We are using MEAN stack with all of them upgraded to their latest versions.
We have been able to upgrade everything except for one problem. We used pbkdf2Sync method (comes inbuilt with express) for hashing passwords like so:
/**
* Hook a pre save method to hash the password
*/
UserSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
    if (this.password && this.password.length > 6) {
       this.salt = new Buffer(crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('base64'), 'base64');
       this.password = this.hashPassword(this.password);

    next();
});

* Create instance method for hashing a password
*/

   if (this.salt && password) {
      return crypto.pbkdf2Sync(password, this.salt, 10000, 64).toString('base64');
   } else {
    return password;
   }
};

In the latest versions, they have changed the encoding to utf8 and also changed the pbkdf2Sync to include a mandatory digest. I am not sure what else they have changed.
The problem:
The passwords hashed and stored in the mongo database using earlier version of node does not match with the password generated by hashPassword function after version upgrade.
I have tried:
1) Specifying encoding string
2) Using buffers
3) Adding digest option as parameter
And I dont get the same hashed password with any of these.
I tried changing the hashPassword function with many combinations. One of the tries I made was this, but does not work.
UserSchema.methods.hashPassword = function (password) {
  if (this.salt && password) {
     return crypto.pbkdf2Sync(password, new Buffer(this.salt, 'base64').toString('binary'), 10000, 64, 'SHA1').toString('base64');
  } else {
    return password;
 }
};

","Looks like older versions of Node used SHA-1 as digest. Also, you should pass in the salt as a binary buffer (I'm using the supplied salt string from your example, if you have stored the salt as Base64-encoded binary you can probably leave the base64 encoding that you're using as-is and only explicitly set the correct digest).
The following yields the expected result:
const crypto = require('crypto');

let password = 'ramco@123';
let salt     = `d\u001e'��\u0001\u0004\u0012)aq�**G\u000f`;

sum cs into WHNF, we must know the exact value of each element in cs.
This prevents building up a chain of thunks, which I think your existing code was attempting to do, but failing, as foldl' only forces the accumulator into WHNF. Since your accumulator was a pair, the WHNF is just (_thunk, _another_thunk), so your intermediate thunks were not getting forced.

","As Rob Napier said, PBKDF2 is what the system is using to hash the password being passed into the encryption process. The site is actually using aes-256-cbc encryption. That encryption process can include a password. 
After the information is encrypted, that payload is signed with an HMAC key.

public SecretKey deriveKeyPbkdf2(byte[] salt, String password) {
    try {
        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();

        KeySpec keySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt,

        SecretKeyFactory keyFactory = null;
        try {
            keyFactory = SecretKeyFactory
                    .getInstance(PBKDF2_DERIVATION_ALGORITHM);
        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        SecretKey secretKey = keyFactory.generateSecret(keySpec);
        byte[] keyBytes = secretKey.getEncoded();

        SecretKey result = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, ""AES"");

        long elapsed = System.currentTimeMillis() - start;

        return secretKey;
        //return  secretKey;
    } catch (GeneralSecurityException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}

The fact is that if I call this method with the same password and salt, it doesn't work (it gives me new keys all the time, not matching at all!).
What is wrong with it? There's something with Android that I should know?
Ok so I managed to find the ""original"" snippet of code that actually work (I tested it with exactly the same input of my original question)...Any hint?
public static byte[] deriveKeyPbkdf2(byte[] salt, String password) {
try {
    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
    KeySpec keySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt,
            ITERATION_COUNT, KEY_LENGTH);
    SecretKeyFactory keyFactory = SecretKeyFactory
            .getInstance(PBKDF2_DERIVATION_ALGORITHM);
    byte[] keyBytes = keyFactory.generateSecret(keySpec).getEncoded();
    Log.d(TAG, ""key bytes: "" + toHex(keyBytes));

    long elapsed = System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
    Log.d(TAG, String.format(""PBKDF2 key derivation took %d [ms]."",
            elapsed));

    return keyBytes;
} catch (GeneralSecurityException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
}

}
","The code:  
SecretKey secretKey = keyFactory.generateSecret(keySpec);
byte[] keyBytes = secretKey.getEncoded();

return secretKey;

You should be returning keyBytes not secretKey.
Or with:
SecretKey result = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, ""AES"");
return secretKey;

You should be returning result not secretKey.




Simplified for understanding:
KeySpec keySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt, ITERATION_COUNT, KEY_LENGTH);
SecretKeyFactory keyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(PBKDF2_DERIVATION_ALGORITHM);

SecretKey secretKey = keyFactory.generateSecret(keySpec);
byte[] keyBytes = secretKey.getEncoded();

return keyBytes;

I have a rough draft of the procedure that I'll be using to generate the hashed function. But while I am creating the table in PL/SQL Developer which will hold the generated hashed password, what should I declare the data type for the encrypted password variable?
It might be a lame question but I'm trying to learn online. It would be a huge help if I can get links for further study as well. thank you. please help
","The first link, as always, is Thomas Pornin's canonical answer to How to securely hash passwords.

Storage in the database

The hash can be stored in BINARY format for the least transformations and smallest number of bytes; see below for sizes.  

Alternately, store it in a CHAR after converting to hex, which costs a transformation and double the bytes of the BINARY size
Alternatively, store it in a CHAR after converting to Base64, which costs a transformation and 4/3rds the number of bytes of BINARY size plus padding
i.e. PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-512 where all 64 bytes of output are used would be

BINARY(64) as binary
CHAR(128) as hex
CHAR(88) as Base64


The number of iterations should be stored in an INT, so it can be trivially increased later
The salt, which must be a per-user, cryptographically random value, can be stored in a BINARY format for the smallest number of bytes, and should be at least 12, and preferably 16-24 bytes long.

i.e. for a 16 byte binary salt

BINARY(16) as binary
CHAR(32) as hex
CHAR(24) as Base64


Optionally a password hash algorithm version as a small INT type

i.e. 1 for PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-512, and then later if you change to BCrypt, 2 for BCrypt, etc.



Normal PBKDF2 considerations

Consider using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-512, as SHA-512 in particular has 64-bit operations that reduce the advantage most GPU based attackers have over you as of early 2016.
Use a high (hundreds of thousands or high tens of thousands) of iterations.  
Don't ask for a larger number of PBKDF2 output bytes than the native hash function supports

SHA-512 <= 64 bytes
SHA-384 <= 48 bytes
SHA-256 <= 32 bytes
SHA-224 <= 28 bytes
MD5 <= 20 bytes

The documentation of the function doesn't mention thread safety at all, so I'm currently using a lock to be on the safe side but I'd prefer not to use a lock if I don't have to.
","Lacking documentation or source code, one option is to build a test app with say 10 threads looping on calls to CCKeyDerivationPBKDF with a random selection from say 10 different sets of arguments with 10 known results.
Each thread checks the result of a call to make sure it is what is expected. Each thread should also have a usleep() call for some random amount of time (bell curve sitting on say 10% of the time each call to CCKeyDerivationPBKDF takes) in this loop in order to attempt to interleave operations as much as possible.
You'll probably want to instrument it with debugging that keeps track of how much concurrency you are able to generate. With a 10% sleep time and 10 threads, you should be able to keep 9 threads concurrent.
If it makes it through an aggregate of say 100,000,000 calls without an error, I'd assume it was thread safe. Of course you could run it for much longer than that to get greater assurances.

","After going through the source code of the CCKeyDerivationPBKDF() I find it to be ""thread unsafe"". While the code for CCKeyDerivationPBKDF() uses many library functions which are thread-safe(eg: bzero), most user-defined function(eg:PRF) and the underlying functions being called from those user-defined functions, are potentially thread-unsafe. (For eg. due to use of several pointers and unsafe casting of memory eg. in CCHMac). I would suggest unless they make all the underlying functions thread-safe or have some mechanism to alteast make it conditionally thread-safe, stick with your approach, or modify the commoncrypto code to make it thread-safe and use that code.

The error also does not show when running the server with the basic python application.py command on the default port 5000. When letting nginx and uwsgi handle the connections, I get the Internal Server Error shown above. Not really sure what's happening. All other non-crypto routes go through fine.
Update: running the server one level up in uwsgi with the following command will also work. Nginx still does not:
uwsgi --socket 0.0.0.0:8000 --protocol=http -w wsgi

These answers says the thing is salt is differrent and cbc mode matters. In my case salt is constant and I've switched to other modes. Output is still different each time.
","The initialization vector used in CBC mode is a random block, so each encryption will be different.  An IV is sort of like a salt, except when encrypting a message there is no reason to ever specify any specific IV to use (a random IV should always be used).  The IV is often put in front of the first block of the encrypted message.

"32564505","Dynamically increase iterations for PBKDF2 when the password is wrong","I am thinking about implementing PBKDF2 in my Laravel 5 app to replace the default blowfish-based authentication.
Is it feasible to double the iteration count each time the password has been entered incorrectly?
e.g. Default iterations are 2000, and when the password is wrong the first time, the next attempt will be 4000 iterations, then 8000, etc.
","While you could continue iterating on the PBKDF2 hash in theory, it's made impossible by the fact that you don't know the original value, which is why you have a hash in the first place. You could store the iteration count and try resuming the iteration, but you'd hit a snag — not having knowledge of the key-derivation function's internal state.
Consider the following:
var_dump(($hash = hash_pbkdf2(""sha256"", ""password"", ""salt"", 2000)));
var_dump(hash_pbkdf2(""sha256"", $hash, ""salt"", 2000));
var_dump(hash_pbkdf2(""sha256"", ""password"", ""salt"", 4000));

This produces:
string(64) ""9209a0c90243e88b89488f99cd7ea010c244cc7a9d4bf65c157f2d8f642eb952""
string(64) ""b90c5d9a2d8bb559a36682bd6044a8da0480199148339fe34ef62598e052b0b6""
string(64) ""99a4d4dd66f714fae1bab9246ea449dd598d7683a569227c07cdb679e3ed3474""

Ergo, this is impossible. And also a denial of service waiting to happen if it did work, as it would be your server doing the computations.
In short, stick with password_hash (which Laravel uses) that does all of the security for you. The less you do to your auth code, the less you can introduce a vulnerability.

void PBKDF2_HMAC_SHA_512_string(const char* pass, const char* salt, int32_t iterations, uint32_t HashLength, char* out) {
    unsigned int i;
    HashLength = HashLength / 2;
    unsigned char* digest = new unsigned char[HashLength];
    PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC(pass, strlen(pass), (const unsigned char*)salt, strlen(salt), iterations, EVP_sha512(), HashLength, digest);

When I call the function like below, I expect to get a hash back of 2400 in length, however it returns me 16:
char PBKDF2Hash[1025]; //\0 terminating space?
memset(PBKDF2Hash, 0, sizeof(PBKDF2Hash));
PBKDF2_HMAC_SHA_512_string(""Password"", ""0123456789123456"", 3500, 1024, PBKDF2Hash);
//PBKDF2Hash is now always 16 long -> strlen(PBKDF2Hash),
//while I expect it to be 2400 long?
//How is this possible and why is this happening?
//I can't figure it out

","Since digest is a pointer, sizeof(digest) will not give the length of the array. Depending on different platforms, sizeof(digest) may give you 4 or 8, which is not what you want. Maybe you should use for (i = 0; i < HashLength; i++).
Another unrelated issue of your code is that, digest is not deleted in PBKDF2_HMAC_SHA_512_string, which causes memory leak

"50459292","Performance of PBKDF2 c#.NET with","
I need to implement a password hashing mechanism for our system. I am using PBKDF2 for the purpose. I have made a small console application for the demo purpose. With the parameters I am using, Its taking my desktop 56 ms to generate the final hash.
From the sources I have gone through, they mentioned the generation time of 100ms should be reasonably secured. Is it the correct assumption or should I make my generation slower? If yes, what parameters should I probably change? 

CODE:
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var watch = System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch.StartNew();
        byte[] op = null;
        op = GetPDKDF2(""password"", 20, 10000);
        watch.Stop();
        Console.WriteLine(""total time: "" + watch.ElapsedMilliseconds);
        Console.ReadKey();
    }

    public static byte[] GetPDKDF2(string password, int saltSize, int iterationCount)
    {
        var pdf = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, saltSize, iterationCount);
        return pdf.GetBytes(20);
    }

}

","The standard delay to aim for is, as you said, 100ms.  The time taken to compute a hash with PBKDF2 is proportionate to the iteration count.  With this in mind, you could probably just double your iteration count to get a delay of around 100ms.
I suggest you don't allow the iteration count to change, at least not as an argument to the function.  Changing the iteration count in future, as hardware progresses, is a good idea, but you need to ensure the iteration count used is noted with the produced hash.
I'd use a constant value for the iteration count instead:
const int ITERATION_COUNT = 20000;

And use:
public static byte[] GetPDKDF2(string password, int saltSize)
{
    var pdf = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, saltSize, ITERATION_COUNT);
    return pdf.GetBytes(20);

These applications typically work by deriving a key from the user's password using something like PBKDF2, and performing encryption/decryption on client side.

One could write an essay on this, but instead I suggest you start by reading the linked references.  If you have any questions, let me know.
In a nutshell, the ""more zero-knowledge"" you want the system to be, the harder it is to realise without sacrificing usability (one example is overcoming the points made in Javascript Cryptography Considered Harmful).  However, there are various tradeoffs you can make in order to make it sufficiently difficult to cheat without affecting usability too much.

Because this was taking quite a while to run (using 500,000 iterations) it appeared to be crashing here every time, but it was actually not due to this line.
I ended up fixing it flipping a bool flag in the signal handler, and having a separate thread watching that flag. When the flag was set, it called the destructor, which in turn triggered the normal shutdown flow, allowing all my threads to shutdown and save correctly.

So far, my code is able to produce a randomly generated mnemonic phrase correctly. However, when converting the 12 word Mnemonic Phrase into a 512-bit seed, the resulting value does not match with results from Ian Coleman's BIP39 Tool.
To start, a SecureRandom object generates a random 512-bit Entropy value (ENT). The ENT value is hashed using SHA256 to compute the checksum value (CS), which is the first 4 bits of the hash. The checksum is concatenated to end of ENT to give ENT_CS. ENT_CS is split into sections of 11 bits each, and the corresponding integer value of the 11 bits is used as the index number to obtain a word from the Word List. This generates my 12 word Mnemonic Phrase. So far, all steps up to this point match the expected results from aforementioned BIP39 Tool.
To create the Seed, I am using PBKDF2 with HmacSHA512, setting the iterations to 2048, and the key-size to 512 bits (64 bytes). I have tested my implementation of PBKDF2 against these Test Vectors, Google's ""crypto"" package implementation, and NovaCrypto's Java BIP39 implementation.

","Looks like I was able to answer my own question.
In my program, I was concatenating the seed words without spaces using
String mnemonicPhrase = """";
for (String word : mnemonicWords)
  mnemonicPhrase += word;

But this is not the correct format, as the spaces are to be included. Changing this code block to add spaces:
String mnemonicPhrase = """";
for(int i=0; i<mnemonicWords.length; i++) {
    mnemonicPhrase += mnemonicWords[i];
    if(i < mnemonicWords.length-1) mnemonicPhrase += "" "";
}

I believe it may have something to do with the string to byte encoding, but I cannot pinpoint what exactly is causing the issue. When I was testing my HMAC code, I had to rely on online generators because I couldn't find vectors for HMAC-SHA224 and HMAC-SHA256. Some calculators would give me completely different output values for the same key, message combination. That could be because of how they are processing the inputs, but I am not sure. I would appreciate it if someone more experienced could help me out with this.
EDIT: This problem is solved. Seems that all that was needed was to pass int as a binary string of length 4. I updated the code with the fixes.
EDIT 2: I read the standard again to realize the solution was in my face the entire time (standard says to encode i as a 32-bit big endian integer).
","The solution was to convert int to a binary string of length 4. Thanks to @EgorSkriptunoff for his insight.

"50820331","How to set the out-length with the Web Crypto API SubtleCrypto.deriveKey() for PBKDF2","According to the doc a simple example to derive a password with PBKDF2 is
  return window.crypto.subtle.importKey(
    'raw', 
    encoder.encode(password), 
    {name: 'PBKDF2'}, 
    false, 
    ['deriveBits', 'deriveKey']
  ).then(function(key) {
    return window.crypto.subtle.deriveKey(
      { ""name"": 'PBKDF2',
        ""salt"": encoder.encode(salt),
        ""iterations"": iterations,
        ""hash"": 'SHA-256'
      },
      key,
      { ""name"": 'AES-CTR', ""length"": 128 }, //api requires this to be set
      true, //extractable
      [ ""encrypt"", ""decrypt"" ] //allowed functions
    )
  }).then(function (webKey) {
    return crypto.subtle.exportKey(""raw"", webKey);
  })

As one can see the API lets you choose:

key derivation function (and it's underlying hash)
salt
iterations
raw key material (ie. password)

However as far as I can see there is no options for choosing the out-length. It seems that the cipher suite parameter { ""name"": 'AES-CTR', ""length"": 128 } influences the out length, but you can only choose 16 and 32 byte.
For example with 10,000 rounds, salt: 'salt', password: 'key material' with 128 it will result in the following 16 bytes:
26629f0e2b7b14ed4b84daa8071c648c

whereas with { ""name"": 'AES-CTR', ""length"": 256 } you will get
26629f0e2b7b14ed4b84daa8071c648c648d2cce067f93e2c5bde0c620030521

How do I set the out length apart from 16 or 32 byte? Do I have to truncate it myself?
","deriveKey function with AES algorithm option returns you AES key. Possible AES key length parameters are following (in bits):

128
192
256

So, you are able to choose only from them when using AES cipher. In my opinion, it's a bad idea to modify a key generated from deriveKey function. First of all, you will break an algorithm standard, and also in future you will have a problem with using truncated keys.
But if you want just to use PBKDF2 and derive bits from a password, you can use deriveBits function. Here is an example:
window.crypto.subtle.deriveBits(
        {
            name: ""PBKDF2"",
            salt: window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(16)),
            iterations: 50000,
            hash: {name: ""SHA-256""}, // can be ""SHA-1"", ""SHA-256"", ""SHA-384"", or ""SHA-512""
        },
        key, //your key from generateKey or importKey
        512 //the number of bits you want to derive, values: 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 512, 1024, 2048
    )
    .then(function(bits){
        //returns the derived bits as an ArrayBuffer
        console.log(new Uint8Array(bits));
    })
    .catch(function(err){
        console.error(err);
    });

More examples  here - https://github.com/diafygi/webcrypto-examples#pbkdf2---derivekey .
Also, I have tested possible values for derive bits, and they are powers of 2 (from 8 to 2048).
I hope it will help you. Remember, if you want just use AES cipher better use default values and deriveKey function.

The implementation is here (opensslthreadlock.c).
Here's the code for base64.c/h.
I'm using this to build and test:
gcc -o pbkdf2test pbkdf2.c opensslthreadlock.c base64.c -lcrypto -lpthread

valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full --track-origins=yes -v ./pbkdf2test

","
It all works fine when I run the code in a single thread, but I start getting Invalid reads (using valgrind) for many of the internal free()s in the pbkdf2_check() function.

That appears to be because of:
static char *sha, *salt, *h_pw;

That will always suffer a race condition as pbkdf2_check is written.
Also, once these run:
out:
    free(sha);
    free(salt);
    free(h_pw);
    free(out);

The dangling pointers are reused due to the static storage class.
You should probably remove the static storage class for sha, salt and h_pw, and initialize everything to NULL or 0. Use C99 (-std=c99) and you can:
char *sha=NULL, *salt=NULL, *h_pw=NULL;
int iterations=0, saltlen=0, blen=0;
char *b64=NULL, *keybuf=NULL;
unsigned char *out=NULL;
int match = FALSE;
const EVP_MD *evpmd=NULL;
int keylen=0, rc=-1;

Then, the optimizer will remove the initializers/writes that are not needed.

{
  ""username"":""test"",

On Server Side, To authorize the username/password, I have two hashed password values to compare, One which I received as input and other from database. In normal scenarios we usually have one raw value and other hashed value. Is there any way I can achieve this to match/compare two PBKDF2 hashed values with random salt?

UPDATE:
Was advised to explicitly add a random IV to the cipher setup and added/modified the following lines of code to facilitate it:
SecureRandom r = new SecureRandom();
        byte[] ivBytes = new byte[16];
        r.nextBytes(ivBytes);

        SecretKey key = generateKey(context, keyphrase.toCharArray());
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, new IvParameterSpec(ivBytes));

Ended up with the same result. First few bytes of the text file were still corrupted.
FINAL ANSWER:

","Do not use strings as encryption keys, use a password derivation function such as PBKDF2 with a rounds count such that the function takes ~100ms. That will produce am output of bytes to use as a key.
For the IV use a cryptographic pseudo-random number generator and prefix the encrypted data with the IV, there is no need to keep the IV secret.
Or better yet, use RNCryptor; it does all of this for you and adds encryption authentication, versioning and is cross platform.

"32770067","How to Pass Original PBKDF2 Hash from SQLite3 DB","I know that there are a lot of questions on PBKDF2 and hashes, but most of them seem to talk about bits. Perhaps that is what I need to learn more about, but I'm hoping there is something more straight-forward for my problem.
Note: These are two separate programs (so the variables will seem to repeat, but do not).
The first creates a hashed password and stores it in the db ... This is working fine.
from pbkdf2 import crypt
import sqlite3

cemail = input(""Email: "")
cpassword = input(""Password: "")
pwhash = crypt(cpassword)
connection = sqlite3.connect('/Users/Air/Desktop/users.db')
cursor_v = connection.cursor()
cursor_v.execute(""insert into user (cemail, cpassword) values (?,?)"", (cemail, pwhash))
connection.commit()
cursor_v.close()

The problem is here, where I go to check the database for the original hashed password. Once the hashed password went into the database from the first program, is that it? Is it gone forever (i.e. not able to be compared to something else later, like another password during login)? 
cemail = input(""Login with Email: "")
cpassword = input(""Login with Password: "")
pwhash = crypt(cpassword)
connection = sqlite3.connect('/Users/Air/Desktop/users.db')
cursor_v = connection.cursor()
cursor_v.execute(""SELECT * FROM user WHERE cemail=? AND cpassword=?"", (cemail,pwhash))
row = cursor_v.fetchone()
if pwhash == crypt(pwhash, cpassword):
    print(""Welcome"")
else:
    print(""Invalid"")

when I view the data in the ""key"" variable, there's an error that says ""Hash = 'key.m_hmacsha1.Hash' threw an exception of type 'System.NullReferenceException'"", along with other null values/0s in other methods.

You're inspecting private fields of a class you don't own.  That doesn't always lead to sensible results.  Instead, you should rely only on the public API.

if a user enters in the wrong key, how would I catch this in an exception?

The odds are likely (~15/16) that you'll get an exception indicating ""the padding is invalid and cannot be removed"".  But really you should do this on top of encryption either by
a) computing an HMAC (e.g. HMACSHA256) over the ciphertext, then on decryption verify the HMAC (failure to validate indicates the wrong password or that the data has been tampered with), or
b) Having a well-formed piece of data inside the plaintext that can be used for validation.
(A) is the better answer for various reasons.

You have code like 
var key = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(passwordBytes, saltBytes, 1000);
AES.Key = key.GetBytes(AES.KeySize / 8);
var iv = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(passwordBytes, saltBytes, 1000);
AES.IV = iv.GetBytes(AES.BlockSize / 8);

Since your password, salt, and iteration count are the same for both key and iv, your actual IV is the first 128 bits of your encryption key.  If you want it to be a computed value you'd want to vary the salt (e.g. set the last byte of the salt to 0 for the encryption key, 1 for the IV, and 2 for the HMAC key), or do it as the next output bytes (ask for 32 + 16 + 32 bytes and chop it up accordingly... or, given the .NET implementation, call GetBytes(32), GetBytes(16), GetBytes(32) (Rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes is a streaming API)).
Or, for the IV, just use the randomly generated one during encryption and transmit it with the ciphertext.  (If you do that, be sure to include it in your HMAC computation)

You store salt and saltBytes in fields (though you set one to the other, so it's unclear why you have two fields).  You need to transmit the salt value along with the ciphertext and have the decryptor accept it as input.
Essentially, your functions should be Encrypt(passphrase, data) => <salt, hmac, ciphertext> (or <salt, iv, hmac, ciphertext>) and Decrypt(passphrase, salt, [iv,] hmac, ciphertext) => data.  (Depending on if the IV is transmitted or derived)

","For old, RC2-based encryption (and if your <en-crypt> tag doesn't have the cipher=""AES"" attribute, this is the RC2-based encryption), the algorithm roughly looks like this:
decodedString = RC2.decrypt(Base64.decode(encodedString), MD5.hash(UTF8.encode(passphrase)), 64);
In the decoded string, the first 4 chars of the string is the HEX-representation of the upper-byte of the CRC32 of the rest of the decoded string.
One caveat: when calculating CRC32, you may need to XOR it with -1 (0xFFFFFFFF) as there are different implementations of CRC32 in the wild that may or may not do this final XOR.

","I don't know .net so I don't understand the code in details but as far as I can see there are at least the following problems:

You are not using authenticated encryption. You should use a MAC like HMAC to detect manipulations of the ciphertext. Otherwise, an attacker could manipulate the ciphertext so that it is decrypted to a plausible plaintext.
For DES there exists weak keys. If you're unlucky your derived key is a weak one but the probability to get a weak key usually is negligible. Furthermore, you should use AES instead of 3DES.
I can't see which cipher mode you use. ECB is not recommended. Today, CBC or CTR are recommended by most cryptographers.

The way you should do encryption is as follows:

select a key at random or derive a key from a password
use AES-256 in CBC mode with PKCS#5 padding
select an IV at random
encrypt the data
compute an HMAC over the IV + ciphertext
send IV + ciphertext + HMAC

When receiving the ciphertext:

check that the HMAC of IV + ciphertext is correct
decrypt the ciphertext

","Your question lacks context. What exactly are you trying to achieve? More precisely what attacks are you trying to defend against?
As I understand it, your code always use the same key and initialization vector.
Both the salt parameter passed to PBKDF2 and the IV passed to the block cipher should be generated using a properly seeded CSPRNG. In .Net use RNGCryptoServiceProvider.
Edit:
The salt and IV are not secrets. They should be part of the message or file or whatever this is your code produces.
One more comment: you should probably not use a hard-coded number of PBKDF2 iterations. The number of iterations required increases over time as hardware becomes faster. Thus the number of iterations should also be part of the message/file/record/whatever.

","
don't want to send the password in plaintext over the wire, 

Good idea, but if the connection is not encrypted (something like SSL/TLS), then whatever you send is plaintext. If you hash a password client-side, and send it over the network, then THAT is the password. Some would say that there is no benefit here, but it does prevent the user from exposing their actual password, which they probably re-use on other sites. (read more here)
Ideally you would use something like SSL/TLS to encrypt the connection. I guess if that wasn't possible, using asymmetric encryption with certificates on the message itself that you are sending would be an ok way of re-inventing the wheel, but I am hesitant to recommend that without having a security person look over it. It's very easy to screw up, and the rule is never roll your own crypto scheme. 
If you can't verify/invalidate/update the public key, then it is not a good scheme.

I would need to send the salt to the client, hash the password, send the hash to the server, compare it, and send some authentication token back

The salt isn't supposed to be super secret, but it's not great to just give it away like that, especially to unauthenticated users. The authentication token, hash, salt, etc can all be intercepted if the connection is not encrypted. Even if they couldn't, you didn't solve the problem of users creating accounts through this method (maybe you don't need to, but it is worth mentioning). 
You have to use asymmetric encryption where only the server can decrypt the data.

","There is no short answer to your question, because there are so many pitfalls that can happen if you do it wrong.  But as Gray says, you do need TLS protection.

","The function hash_pbkdf2() will be introduced in PHP version 5.5, so i suspect that your installed PHP version does not yet support this function. Before you call the function, you test whether BCrypt is defined, but the function hash_pbkdf2() (password-based-key-derivation-function) has nothing to do with BCrypt.
It is recommended to hash passwords with BCrypt though, in PHP version 5.5 you can do it with password_hash() instead. There also exist a compatibility pack for earlier versions.
// Hash a new password for storing in the database.
// The function automatically generates a cryptographically safe salt.
$hashToStoreInDb = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);

// Check if the hash of the entered login password, matches the stored hash.
// The salt and the cost factor will be extracted from $existingHashFromDb.

Why I am getting different password length(the last part). I don't get it.
Can you please help me find my mistake?
","The answer to your question is laid on the foundations of various Character Encoding styles. And the dissimilarity in length of String is because of the use of different Encoding in both cases(C and Java Implementation).
You can note in your example that the hash1(because of which the dissimilarity in length is prominent) variable is encoded in UTF-8 in Java while the C used ASCII character encoding(Already mentioned in the ANSI standards).
Also, UTF-8 is a multi-byte encoding is a multi-byte encoding which uses between 1 and 4 bytes per character.
You can also refer this:How many bytes does Unicode Character takes? which might be interesting and that is why the hashes are longer in length in java as compared to C. 
Hope the answer helps to get some insights about the well-researched problem.

In Swift i produce a hash that is 528 characters long.
I've tried following the advice from this post , PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 Java to Swift 3, but still did not receive the desired length.

side note: In the post above, the OP used key length of 192 while i am using a key length of 256. i have also tried to comment and ask a question on the original post, but i dont have enough reputation to do so. i need 50 and i have 3 ... lol

","This whole section in your HMAC function is missing some enum definitions:

decodeKey is declared in your function signature with type keyDecoding which I presume is an enum:
Optional ByVal decodeKey As keyDecoding = kdNone_String

That's what's giving your error, this keyDecoding enum is not defined anywhere. However it looks like it only has 3 members so you could probably roll your own.
The Decode and Encode functions meanwhile take some enum with edBase64 and edHex members. This enum also isn't defined anywhere (although this is not what gives you the error, it's the first point I mentioned).
You haven't included those two functions anyway so I can't say much more than that, but I imagine their signatures will tell you what the name of your second missing enum is. There maybe other issues with the code, but that's just what stood out to me. Make sure you've copied it from source correctly:)

HttpServerUtility.UrlToken(De|En)code() use a url-safe variant of base64 that needs to be replicated.
function base64url_encode($bin) {
    return str_replace(['+', '/', '='], ['-', '_', ''], base64_encode($bin));
}

function base64url_decode($str) {
    return base64_decode(str_replace(['-', '_'], ['+', '/'], $str));
}

When you decode the token the result is a binary string, and trying to run that through mb_convert_encoding to change the endian-ness [I found that awful blog post too] won't do what you think. You can try the following, but the token has an odd number of bytes which is problematic no matter which way you look at it. [edit: is there just a bare \x0d carriage return at the end?]
function swapEndian16($in) {
    $out = '';
    foreach(str_split($in, 2) as $chunk) {
        $out .= $chunk[1] . $chunk[0];
    }
    return $out;
}

The last argument to hash_pbkdf2() should be true, otherwise you're getting a hex-encoded hash rather than the raw bytes.

Really what I'd suggest is asking your vendor if they have any insight on accomplishing this. Chances are that someone's already had and solved this problem with their integrations.
Edit: With the new info from @Evk's answer, here are some sassily-named functions for compatibility with C#'s brilliant base64 URL encoding:
function dumb_base64url_encode($bin) {
    return preg_replace_callback(
        '/(=*)$/',
        function($matches){
            return strlen($matches[0]);
        },
        str_replace(
            ['+', '/'],
            ['-', '_'],
            base64_encode($bin)
        ),
        1
    );
}

function dumb_base64url_decode($str) {
    return base64_decode(
        str_replace(
            ['-', '_'],
            ['+', '/'],
            substr($str, 0, -1)
        )
    );
}

So now, with the un-""corrected"" token: 
$token = ""MqsXexqpYRUNAHR_lHkPRic1g1BYhH6bFNVPagEkuaL8Mf80l_tOirhThQYIbfWYErgu4bDwl-7brVhXTWnJNQ2"";
$id = ""bob@company.com"";
$ssokey = ""7MpszrQpO95p7H"";
$idAndKey = $id . $ssokey;
$salt = dumb_base64url_decode($token);
$hashed = hash_pbkdf2(""sha1"", $idAndKey, $salt, 1000, 24, true);
$data = dumb_base64url_encode($hashed);
echo $data; // output: aE1k9-djZ66WbUATqdHbWyJzskMI5ABS0

And don't sweat whose answer to mark correct, I think @Evk's got the most important bits sorted.

I've tried to translate the C# HttpServerUtility.UrlTokenDecode function to PHP like so:
function UrlTokenDecode($token) {
    $numPadChars = substr($token, -1);

    // add the padded count to the end
    $salt = substr($token, 0, -1) . $numPadChars;

    // Transform the ""-"" to ""+"", and ""*"" to ""/""
    $salt = str_replace('-', '+', str_replace('*', '/', $salt));

    // base64_decode
    $salt = base64_decode($salt);

    return $salt;
}

That didn't get me to where I needed to go. Halp!

","I don't know php at all, but still can help I think. First, as stated in my comment, Rfc2898DeriveBytes in C# uses SHA1 as hash function, not SHA256, doesn't matter what your documentation says.
Next, UrlTokenDecode (and Encode) is quite strange thing I rarely seen in practice. It converts regular base64 to ""url safe"" version as follows:

replaces '+' with '-'
replaces '/' with '_'
removes padding ('==' at the end) and appends length of removed padding as a number as last character (if there were no padding - it still appends ""0""). This step doesn't make any sense to me, but it's how it works.

So to replicate you need to base64_encode, replace, remove padding, and then add padding length as character. So if your base64 string ended with == - you remove that and add ""2"" at the end. If there was no padding - you add ""0"".
So to decode that string you need to make back replacement, then remove last character and add that much '=' to the end as indicated by that character.
So string
MqsXexqpYRUNAHR_lHkPRic1g1BYhH6bFNVPagEkuaL8Mf80l_tOirhThQYIbfWYErgu4bDwl-7brVhXTWnJNQ2

In normal base64 is
  MqsXexqpYRUNAHR/lHkPRic1g1BYhH6bFNVPagEkuaL8Mf80l/tOirhThQYIbfWYErgu4bDwl+7brVhXTWnJNQ==
Then, I have no idea why you do that
mb_convert_encoding($salt, 'UTF-16LE')

Just remove it (though as I don't know php - there might be some reason you are doing that, but I just cannot imagine which, so take care).
Then as other answer states - the last argument to hash_pbkdf2() should be true.
After making this changes your code will work (I used token already converted to normal base64 string):
$token = ""MqsXexqpYRUNAHR/lHkPRic1g1BYhH6bFNVPagEkuaL8Mf80l/tOirhThQYIbfWYErgu4bDwl+7brVhXTWnJNQ=="";
$id = ""bob@company.com"";
$ssokey = ""7MpszrQpO95p7H"";
$idAndKey = $id . $ssokey;
$salt = base64_decode($token);
$hashed = hash_pbkdf2(""sha1"", $idAndKey, $salt, 1000, 24, true);
$data = base64_encode($hashed);
echo $data;

produces expected answer (in normal base64 - you need to ""url encode"" it to get exact match).

"55297214","Password recovery and password derived key encryption","Hi (sorry about the wordy post)
I'm working on a web app that will store some of the users personal data.
I have looked into various ways of encrypting the data to protect it from intruders if the database or web server was compromised and think that creating and storing a unique “master key” encrypted with a password derived key for each user is the best way to go for my set-up.
The only issue I can see is with forgotten passwords. Currently, the users can reset a forgotten password by receiving an email containing a link with a unique token that takes then to the password reset form.
My idea is to add security questions to the registration page that will be used to create a 2nd derived key and use it to encrypt the users master key. The answers will not be stored in the database, just the key derived from them. The questions would be more opinion based than personal or factual.
This will mean there are two encrypted versions of the “master key”.
These questions would be added to the existing password reset form and the answers used to recreate the derived key and decrypt the master key. This would mean that the original master key can then be encrypted using the new password.
I have read many posts on how security questions should not be used to reset passwords but in this case it seems like an additional layer of security.
Does anyone see any potential problems with this approach or have any other suggestions?
Thanks
","It is not clear who you are trying to protect the data from (your organisation or potential intruders), but I would presume that intruders is your main concern, since your organisation has access to the code of the application and therefore can view the passwords that the user is inputting (unless encryption/decryption takes place on the client side).
I would not encrypt the data using the passwords of the users. Instead, I would generate random key(s) for each user, store them on a separate server, and retrieve them once the user authenticates successfully. That separate server would have to be inaccessible from the outside world.
Note that user authentication should also take place on the second server as well. Do not return the keys without prior user authentication, in case the first server gets compromised. You can additionally encrypt these keys using the user passwords and on a different column, using a master key that you are holding in case someone forgets their passwords.
This way you will get stronger passwords as well, than what the average user is going to use.

","Sorry to find this so late. I'm the author of PBKDF2.NET. The speed difference is due to the equality comparison. The library by Defuse implements a slow-compare function, where I chose to leave any custom comparisons up to the consumer. My reasoning is that I didn't want to create a library with additional non-essential utility functions but rather to provide a proper implementation of the algorithm. Whether or not a particular application requires a slow compare really depends on the application so I excluded this.

","It does not make sense to treat licenses like passwords. 
PBKDF2 & iterations only make sense for checks on client side. On server side they just allow to perform a DOS attack on your server. Anyway on a server you can simply add a delay of 1 second for each request.
You don't have to hash them because only licenses in your database are considered to be valid. It does not make any sense to hack your server and steal them. 
For checking the right license entry you just have to prepend the database entry ID of the license to the license itself and you know exactly what entry to check.

","I think you have a bit of a misunderstanding about what PBKDF2 does. It is not an encryption function where you can ever recover the plaintext data (let's put brute force aside as it is not an 'intended use'). Rather, it is a ""slow"" hashing mechanism, often described as ""one way"".
PBKDF2 is a key derivation function, but is also used for storing passwords. Here's a typical flow for PBKDF2 when used for password storage.

A user creates an account with a website with a password. The site generates a random salt, then applies PBKD2 to the password with the salt, and stores the result and the salt. The salt is stored in plain text.
When the user needs to log in again, the site asks for the username and password. It looks up the salt for that user, then it re-applied PBKDF2 to the password the user entered.
It compares the stored hash with the hash of what the user entered. If the hashes are equal, the site knows they typed the password correctly.

This approach means the site does not store the password in a way that it can possibly know. This allows the site to disavow knowledge of the password.
If that is what you want to do, then that is how you should use it.
If you do need a way to have a ""two way"" algorithm, then this goes from hashing to encryption. A symmetric algorithm would be used in this place, with all of the troublesome issues of key and IV management. You would most likely want to take a look at a high abstraction that is built on top of symmetric ciphers like libsodium.
libsodium is a nice abstraction built on top of primitives that takes the guess work out of how to use them. If offers simple APIs such as ""encrypt this thing with this password"" and it correctly derives an encryption key from the password, performs some form of authentication on the encryption, and is regarded well by information security experts.

How can I perform a key stretching with something like PBKDF2 in mysql to enhance the strength of weak keys.
Also I would like to know that if I use a hex value directly from a function like SHA2('Key', 512) as my key for the aes_encrypt() function, will it reduce the strength of the key because there will only be 16 characters in the character set every time a key is generated.

","The solution: use another encryption algorithm, or use the lib Spongy Castle.
Useful lib: Nimbus JOSE JWT Spongycastle, if you need help mixing jwt with spongy castle.
Why it's not working for you: it is a particularity of the device you're using. Some devices support the PBKDF2withHmacSHA256 algorithm, while others don't.
How I came to this conclusion:
First I thought it could be a simple typo, but I found in the JJWT github that while the issue indeed existed, it was already fixed. Since the verification now uses equalsignorecase the typo wouldn't matter. You can confirm in the code.
Then I thought it could be android or java version. But I discovered that since java 8 release it was already implemented.
I thought it could be the android version, but it works from API 26.
I've also tested the code you're using, and it worked just fine here, so it would not be any of these problems. Then I researched a lot, seen some other questions, people having the same problem with other libs and other algorithms.
Extra:
There is a code from k3v that probably can help you (using Spongy Castle):
PKCS5S2ParametersGenerator generator = new PKCS5S2ParametersGenerator(new SHA256Digest());
generator.init(PBEParametersGenerator.PKCS5PasswordToUTF8Bytes(password), salt, iterations); 
KeyParameter key = (KeyParameter)generator.generateDerivedMacParameters(keySizeInBits);

Every value in the byte stream you're (mostly-not-)reading is important.  If you find that you've hard-coded any values you've done something wrong.

","You did use the Fast PBKDF2 module, as the cProfile output shows.
I'm guessing whatever performance measurements made by python-fastpbkdf2 were comparing against older versions of Python, OpenSSL, or both, and newer versions caught up on speed (while Fast PBKDF2 hasn't seen an update in over three years). As it happens, it looks like as of 2016 (a year after Fast PBKDF2 saw its last update), Python added a fast path when linked against OpenSSL 1.1.0 or higher that uses OpenSSL's optimized PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC rather than Python's homegrown (slower) version. And even before that, Python had improved their homegrown version back in late 2013; if the python-fastpbkdf2 benchmarks were run before that improvement was released, the performance would have been much worse.
Basically, don't assume claims of being 40% faster are true, even if they were true in the past (and there's no guarantee they were true in the past either).
It's also possible compilers and/or your package repo maintainers built better versions of OpenSSL; at least one of the claimed benefits of Fast PBKDF2 is that he explicitly inlined a number of operations, but a properly compiled version of OpenSSL using PGO+LTO would be able to automatically inline the appropriate operations anyway (and if the setup files for python-fastpbkdf2 didn't properly build it with PGO+LTO, it could lose out as a result). Between that and OpenSSL making similar code improvements, the gap could easily have narrowed.

Is it like the function is designed not to work with special characters?

No.  PBKDF2 is a wrapper around HMAC, which is a wrapper around XOR and a hashing algorithm.  PBKDF2 and its dependencies are nothing but routine math, and operate, more or less, at the binary level.  You can feed any hexadecimal values you want, and it will function correctly.
Now, your code may be doing something strange in the conversions prior to calling PBKDF2, or whatever software and middleware and front end you are using may have issues.
To test:

Print out the hexadecimal coded binary conversion of what you're trying to hash as well as the salt.  Examine this.
If angle brackets in particular are an issue, do you have XML and/or HTML involved anywhere in the path between the human entering the data and your PBKDF2 function
I have several independent PBKDF2 implementations at my Github repository, and in particular I've just finished upgrading the OpenSSL library version to support multiple input and output encodings.


Test that hexadecimal coded hash and hexadecimal coded salt against several of these implementations.
Test the test vectors in the above repositories against your code, beginning to end.
Test the test vectors in the above repositories against as close to the bare-metal PBKDF2 implementation you have as possible, skipping all the other code to the extent you can.

","Nothing says that it would be signed.  The fact that dkLen is capped at (2^32 - 1) * hLen suggests that it's an unsigned integer, and that it cannot roll over from 0xFFFFFFFF (2^32 - 1) to 0x00000000.
Of course, PBKDF2(MD5) wouldn't hit 2^31 until you've asked for 34,359,738,368 bytes.  That's an awful lot of bytes.

SHA-2-512 / SHA-3-512: 137,438,953,472

Since the .NET implementation (in Rfc2898DeriveBytes) is an iterative stream it could be polled for 32GB via a (long) series of calls.  Most platforms expose PBKDF2 as a one-shot, so you'd need to give them a memory range of 32GB (or more) to identify if they had an error that far out.  So even if most platforms get the sign bit wrong... it doesn't really matter.
PBKDF2 is a KDF (key derivation function), so used for deriving keys.  AES-256 is 32 bytes, or 48 if you use the same PBKDF2 to generate an IV (which you really shouldn't).  Generating a private key for the ECC curve with a 34,093 digit prime is (if I did my math right) 14,157 bytes.  Well below the 32GB mark.

You can, however, store i in a signed, 32-bit integer type without any special handling. If i rolls over (increments from 0x7FFFFFFF to 0xF0000000), it will continue to be encoded correctly, and continue to increment correctly. With two's complement encoding, bitwise results for addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same as long as all values are treated as either signed or unsigned.

"45377764","Is my authentication system secured?","I want to implement an authentication system by following good practices, i want it as simple as possible and secured (im not going to implement some magic hashing function or something to feel a hero..) just wanting to use already known hash but not sure the right way of using it.
I read some articles on how Lastpass (a password management company) mange to handle their authentication and i loved their idea.So i wanted to implement my own authentication based on it.
Basically im creating an authentication key from the password on the client side (so the password is never sent as a plan text to the server).
that authentication key im sending to the server than do some hashing operations also in the server side and compare the result to the one inside the database.
On my client side:
auth_key = PBKDF2(SHA256, password+username, last_login_fe_salt, fe_rounds)

explanation - hashing password+username+last_login_fe_salt text fe_rounds times
last_login_fe_salt -> a random salt sent to the user once he/she input their username in text field - 
To be honest, not sure how this last_login_fe_salt is efficent for the cryptography against Dictionary attacks but atleast two people having the same password will send different hashes on their network.
any hacker can get this data by asking from the server, i can add server side limitations (req/s if it makes some difference etc.. let me know what you think) also adding captcha might be a good idea. When a user logged in successfuly the server generates a new random string and saves in into the database.
*I didnt see any explanation which salt Lastpass uses on their client side hashing, they are using PBKDF2 algorithm that needs a salt parameter.
fe_rounds -> number of rounds given by the server when typing username -
 its fixed for everybody and configurable by the server, also in articles i read about Lastpass they dont explain from where they receive the client side number of rounds...
so now we send auth_key as is to the server...
On my server side
now we are creating a new hash to compare the one inside the db.
Why another hash? if i understand correctly we bind the hash for server side data, like a combination of a password (that only the user knows) and server data.
db_auth=PBKDF2(SHA256, auth_key, user_be_salt, 100,000+user_configurable_rounds)

user_be_salt -> a random number that saved in db known only to the server and the ones who obtain the database, this changes on every successful login.
user_configurable_rounds -> number of iterations, every user can choose the amount of iterations (like in Lastpass) so attacker need also to guess the number or iterations?
I would be happy to hear what do you think about this authentication system, if its wrong than explain to me why and tell me what Lastpass do because i did not understand their entire authentication flow.
","Most of what you're doing is useless from a security perspective. Lastpass has unusual security requirements -- don't treat them as a source of best practices.
If the client is responsible for hashing, and all of the parameters to that hashing are fixed, the hash effectively becomes the password. An attacker doesn't need to know the original password; they can simply pass the hash to the server.
Generally speaking, there is no way to verify a password over a network without either sending the password across the network (for traditional password authentication protocols), or having the server store the password in plaintext (for less commonly used protocols like SRP). Of the two, the former is preferable, as it's possible to secure the password in transit using protocols like SSL/TLS, whereas protocols like SRP require the plaintext of the password to operate.
Tweaking the PBKDF round count, either on the client or server side, is pointless. Set a fixed round count that makes the hash slow, but not so slow that it will place an undue load on the client or server. (100,000 rounds is probably excessive for a server-side hash. It takes roughly half a second to verify a password with those settings, so just two login requests per second would use 100% of one core on your server!)

Now, to create this key, I use PBKDF2, which allows me to set its certain parameters like hashing function and iteration number, as it derives a key using an initial information, such as a password, which is what I have. As SHA-1 broken, I wanted to use SHA-256 for the key derivation function's key hashing but I don't understand if it is possible.

","First of all the AES-256 is not so slow compared to AES-128. See from Cryptography

CPU overhead (+20% for a 192-bit key, +40% for a 256-bit key: 

The PBKDF2's output size is equal to the used PRF function, in your case it is a hash function as SHA-256. Therefore the output will be in 256-bit size.
The PBKDF2's function requires a dkLen parameter - desired Key Lenght.

PBKDF2(PRF, Password, Salt, c, dkLen)

When you put 128 into this parameter you will get a 128-bit. The output is the substring of the full 256-bit output. You will get first 128-bit.
You can see it from implementations as here

","AES-256 is not much slower than AES-128, keysetup is slightly slower, and every block only needs 4 more rounds (11 to 15). So it's about 40% slower at most, and with modern phones having dedicated AES-instruction sets probably even less.
PBKDF2 can output almost any size key, and mostly HMAC-SHA1 or HMAC-SHA256 (not SHA1 or SHA256 directly, but most API's only accept a hash function as parameter and do the HMAC implicitly) is used as the building block ""random function"". But either one can produce 256, 128 or 10000 byte keys (not that you need that large a key anyway). With HMAC-SHA256 it's equally cheap or expensive to derive a 256 or 128 bit key (the latter is a truncated version of the former, but that's no issue); it's the same work. With HMAC-SHA1 (which is as secure as HMAC-SHA256 for PBKDF2) it's a bit more the work to get a 256 bit key, as 256 is more than the digest size. 
So use AES-256 and PBKDF2-(HMAC)-SHA256, should be no performance issue.

When I implement PBKDF2 in a server and client, it is my understanding (could be way wrong, sorry), that the server keeps the encrypted/hashed password in the database, and the user sends his or her password over the net and then it is checked by the server for validity.

This is basically correct. When setting up an account the user sends user and pass to the server. The server stores user and PBKDF2(pass) and then discards pass. When logging in the server looks up against the user column and compares PBKDF2(pass_as_submitted) to the value stored when the account was set up. If they match, the user is authenticated.

Do I just depend on the networking library or SSL to protect this information?

In the sort of situation you're talking about, yes.

Would it be wise to perform an SHA2 hash on the password client side, and then send that to the server and then check the sha2 has against the PBKDF2 hash?

No. The problem here is you're just changing the thing you're keeping from the user's password to a hash of the user's password. It's still known to an attacker who can read the database.
(There are reasons this is marginally better than knowing the password, most particularly in case of password reuse. However, these do not justify such an approach.)
It's worth pointing out as well that SHA2(password) will not match PBKDF2(password).

What kinds of these things are done normally by the professionals?

First, use TLS (aka SSL). Having a good, encrypted connection between client and server is first priority. For a website, you should use TLS on every page, not just when sending the password. At the very least it must be used on the login page and on the request that receives username and password information.
Your TLS connection should be set up properly: it should use HSTS if appropriate (and it's a website). It should avoid outdated algorithms (only support TLS 1.1+ if possible). It should use appropriate cipher modes.
Beyond that, it depends on your use case. Perhaps it's worth implementing two factor authentication - be it using TOTP or SMS codes or similar. Perhaps you should be looking at logins without passwords, for example using client-side TLS certificates or OAuth2 tokens. Maybe you should use an existing authentication library like Kerberos. Maybe you need to look at password policies to ensure users are setting good passwords or pass phrases.
These questions are complex and depend on your use case. Thinking about them is the big first step most people don't take. Using PBKDF2 is a great start but there's no universal answer. If possible, get an expert to do your security analysis. If not, open source plus some promo can often get people to look at it. Worst case scenario, read up on security, check out the OWASP Top 10 and think about every part of the system. Where possible use existing libraries made by experts. If you have to roll your own, you're probably doing it wrong.

django-hijack looks like a good one. Its docs has good explaination on how to use it so I am not going to go through that here. If you don't like this package you can see the list of packages for this purpose here on djangopackages and choose the one you like.
django-hijack usage:
Complete the Installation and After Installation steps first.

Make a post request to /hijack/<user_id> where <user_id> is the column id of table user. If you have not updated the field id on model user it will be 1, 2, 3, .... So the url will be similar to /hijack/1/
Make a post request to /hijack/username/<username> if you want to hijack by username. eg. /hijack/username/awesome_username/
Make a post request to /hijack/email/<user email>/ if you want to hijack by email of user. eg. /hijack/email/awesome@email.com/

After making a post request to one of these urls as superuser you will be redirected to the specified HIJACK_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL in settings.py

I am not sure if django-hijack will work on python 3 or newer versions of Django. If it doesn't works try out django-impersonate which provides the same functionality in a similar way and officially supports python 3.6+ and django 1.11+

To do this, I have to connect myself as a user but I have just his email not his password. I found in the table User this the email and the password but the password begins by this : pbkdf2_sha256 ...
So I guess the password is encrypted. Is there a way easier to do this ? 
Thank you for your help !
","Depending on how the passwords are hashed while new users are created, you could just replace the user's hash with another one : 

Go in database and copy the passwordHash of the user you would like to log with
Store this hash somewhere (you will need it to revert the change)
Copy the hash of another user (a user for whom you know the password)
Paste the hash of this user in place of the hash of the user you want to log in

If the hashs are generated the same way, you will be able to log with the other user's password.
Then when you are done, revert the changes in database.
Hope it helps.

Ordinarily I would turn to password based keys (i.e. PBKDF2) to derive the key, however I also have to provide oAuth2 sign in capabilities (with Facebook and Google), which means I don't have a password that I can use to generate the key.
I have tried to find a unique, consistent and secret key that's returned from the oAuth2 providers, but I can't find one.  
Are there any approaches that can combine the two?  I suspect the answer is no, but wanted to ask just in case.

","First and foremost, if you're a web app, use SSL. Second if you still want to encrypt messages use the cryptography module.  
import ujson as json
import base64, zlib
from config import config_opts
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend

SALT = config_opts['SALT']
SALT_SIZE = config_opts['SALT_SIZE']
SALT_OFF_SET = config_opts['SALT_OFF_SET']
NUMBER_OF_ITERATIONS = config_opts['NUMBER_OF_ITERATIONS']
AES_MULTIPLE = config_opts['AES_MULTIPLE']

def cryptkey(password=''):
    digest = hashes.Hash(hashes.SHA256(), backend=default_backend())
    digest.update(SALT+password)
    return Fernet(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(digest.finalize()))

def encrypt(meta, password=''):
    meta = json.dumps(meta)
    meta = str(zlib.compress(meta, 9))
    f = cryptkey(password)
    return base64.urlsafe_b64encode(f.encrypt(bytes(meta)))

def decrypt(meta, password=''):
    meta = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(meta)
    f = cryptkey(password)
    meta = f.decrypt(bytes(meta))
    meta = zlib.decompress(meta)
    return json.loads(meta)


 try:
        tcp_client = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
        tcp_client.connect((host_ip, server_port))
        tcp_client.sendall(encrypt([Login.encode(), Pass.encode()]))
        received = tcp_client.recv(2048)
        received = received.decode(""utf8"")
        if received == ""Auth succeed"":
            print(""Credentials are correct"")
        else:
            print(""Either credentials are incorrect or our servers are unavailable right now"")
    finally:
        tcp_client.close()

Then your backend should use the decrypt functio (and optional password). Base64 makes it more suitable for REST api communication.

The printed output is 48, which makes sense because of SHA-384. However, my JavaScript code outputs an array with 384 elements.
JavaScript file
const crypto = require(""crypto"");

const key = ""password1"";

let bArr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];

//create the salt (.toCharArray() in Java)
const salt = key.split("""").join("","");

let encoded = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(key, Buffer.from(salt, ""hex""), 100, 384, ""sha1"");

console.log(encoded.length);

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here. I found a couple of places, where people were discussing how to create the PBKDF2 key, and it looks like this is how I'm supposed to. Also, bArr in my JavaScript example was not used.
I have tried converting both encoded variables into HEX to compare them, but the JavaScript one is much longer. Even if I shorten the key length to 48 (384 -> 48 in the pbkdf2Sync() method), it's still wrong.

Previously I have using 10000 iterations for hashing but now I have reduced it to the 100 iterations but results are almost same.There for I wanted to know that,

Why is my broswer getting frozen when the hashing starts and after hashing is finished browser operated normally.
As I know the broswers are single threaded is there a possible asynchronous approach to this.
What's the best approach in Angular 7 to handle this kind of costly processes.
Or is this is an issue with the library.

I would be glad to know the reasons for this and to know if any one have faced the simmilar scenario.
