"39133437","SSLHandshakeException: Handshake failed on Android N/7.0","I'm working on an app for which the (power)users have to set up their own server (i.e. nginx) to run the backend application. The corresponding domain needs to be configured in the app so it can connect. I've been testing primarily on my own phone (sony z3c) and started developing for 5.1. Later I received an update for 6.0 but still maintained a working 5.1 inside the emulator. Not too long ago, I started to work on an AVD with an image for 7.0 and to my suprise it won't connect to my server, telling me the ssl handshake failed. My nginx configuration is pretty strict, but it works for both 5.1 and 6.0, so .... ?!
Here is what I know:

I use v24 for support libs, i.e. my compileSdkVersion is 24.
I use Volley v1.0.0.
I've tried the TLSSocketFactory, but it doesn't change anything. This seems to be used most of the times to prevent SSL3 use for older SDK versions anyway.
I've tried increasing the timeout, but it doesn't change anything.
I've tried using HttpURLConnection directly, but it doesn't change anything apart from the stack trace (it's without the volley references, but identical otherwise).

Without the TLSSocketFactory the request are made through a bare request queue, instantiated with Volley.newRequestQueue(context).
This is what I see in android studio:

Since it says SSLV3_ALERT_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE I can only assume it for some reason tries to connect using SSLv3 and fails, but this doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever. It might be a cipher-issue, but how can I tell what it is trying to use ? I would rather not enable a ciphers on the server, make a connection attempt and repeat.
My nginx site uses a let's encrypt certificate and has the following configuration:
ssl_stapling on;
ssl_stapling_verify on;
ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/lets-encrypt-x1-cross-signed.pem;
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!aNULL;
ssl_dhparam /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem;
ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;

To test these ciphers I've a script and it confirms these ciphers (run on a wheezy vps outside the server's network):

I can open the server-url in the emulator's browser and get a perfect json response so I know the system itself is capable.
So the question is, why can't I connect on Android 7 ?
Update:
I've looked at a captured packet using tcpdump and wireshark and the enabled ciphers are in the ClientHello, so that should not be a problem.

Cipher Suites (18 suites)

Cipher Suite: Unknown (0xcca9)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xc02b)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0xc02c)
Cipher Suite: Unknown (0xcca8)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xc02f)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0xc030)
Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0x009e)
Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0x009f)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0xc009)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0xc00a)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0xc013)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0xc014)
Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0x0033)
Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0x0039)
Cipher Suite: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0x009c)
Cipher Suite: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0x009d)
Cipher Suite: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0x002f)
Cipher Suite: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0x0035)

As you can see 0xc02f and 0xc030 match, but the next TLSv1.2 packet says: Alert (21), Handshake Failure (40).
Update 2:
These are the curves from Android 5.1 in the ClientHello:

Elliptic curves (25 curves)

Elliptic curve: sect571r1 (0x000e)
Elliptic curve: sect571k1 (0x000d)
Elliptic curve: secp521r1 (0x0019)
Elliptic curve: sect409k1 (0x000b)
Elliptic curve: sect409r1 (0x000c)
Elliptic curve: secp384r1 (0x0018)
Elliptic curve: sect283k1 (0x0009)
Elliptic curve: sect283r1 (0x000a)
Elliptic curve: secp256k1 (0x0016)
Elliptic curve: secp256r1 (0x0017)
Elliptic curve: sect239k1 (0x0008)
Elliptic curve: sect233k1 (0x0006)
Elliptic curve: sect233r1 (0x0007)
Elliptic curve: secp224k1 (0x0014)
Elliptic curve: secp224r1 (0x0015)
Elliptic curve: sect193r1 (0x0004)
Elliptic curve: sect193r2 (0x0005)
Elliptic curve: secp192k1 (0x0012)
Elliptic curve: secp192r1 (0x0013)
Elliptic curve: sect163k1 (0x0001)
Elliptic curve: sect163r1 (0x0002)
Elliptic curve: sect163r2 (0x0003)
Elliptic curve: secp160k1 (0x000f)
Elliptic curve: secp160r1 (0x0010)
Elliptic curve: secp160r2 (0x0011)

In the ServerHello secp384r1 (0x0018) is returned.
And this is from Android 7:

Elliptic curves (1 curve)

Elliptic curve: secp256r1 (0x0017)

Resulting in the Handshake Failure.
Changing the nginx configuration by removing secp384r1 or replacing it with the default (prime256v1) does get it to work. So I guess the question remains: am I able to add elliptic curves ?
The captured data is the same when using the emulator as when using an Android 7.0 device (General Mobile 4G).
Update 3:
Small update, but worth mentioning: I got it to work in the emulator using Android 7.1.1 (!). It shows the following data (again, grabbed using tcpdump and viewed using wireshark):

Elliptic curves (3 curves)

Elliptic curve: secp256r1 (0x0017)
Elliptic curve: secp384r1 (0x0018)
Elliptic curve: secp512r1 (0x0019)

It shows the same 18 Cipher Suites.
","
By default, secure connections (using protocols like TLS and HTTPS) from all apps trust the pre-installed system CAs, and apps targeting Android 6.0 (API level 23) and lower also trust the user-added CA store by default. 

Which means that on Android Nougat (7.0), the game for CAs changed completely.  If you have your key cert, you can add a network security configuration file (if you have your cert), as described here: 
https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config.html
Or you can create your own TrustManager, as described here:
https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-ssl.html#SelfSigned
Or you can enable cipher suites that your server demands but aren't enabled by default on Android N.  For example, here are two ciphers that I needed to add in my own application talking to an old Windows CE server:
    SSLSocket sslsock = (SSLSocket) createSocket();
    List<String> cipherSuitesToEnable = new ArrayList<>();
    cipherSuitesToEnable.add(""SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA"");
    cipherSuitesToEnable.add(""SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA"");
    sslsock.setEnabledCipherSuites(cipherSuitesToEnable.toArray(new String[cipherSuitesToEnable.size()]));

It might be a cipher-issue, but how can I tell what it is trying to use ? I would rather not enable a ciphers on the server, make a connection attempt and repeat.
My nginx site uses a let's encrypt certificate and has the following configuration:
ssl_stapling on;
ssl_stapling_verify on;
ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/lets-encrypt-x1-cross-signed.pem;
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!aNULL;
ssl_dhparam /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem;
ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;

To test these ciphers I've a script and it confirms these ciphers (run on a wheezy vps outside the server's network):

I can open the server-url in the emulator's browser and get a perfect json response so I know the system itself is capable.
So the question is, why can't I connect on Android 7 ?
Update:
I've looked at a captured packet using tcpdump and wireshark and the enabled ciphers are in the ClientHello, so that should not be a problem.

Cipher Suites (18 suites)

Cipher Suite: Unknown (0xcca9)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xc02b)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0xc02c)
Cipher Suite: Unknown (0xcca8)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xc02f)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0xc030)
Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0x009e)
Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0x009f)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0xc009)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0xc00a)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0xc013)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0xc014)
Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0x0033)
Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0x0039)
Cipher Suite: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0x009c)
Cipher Suite: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0x009d)
Cipher Suite: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0x002f)
Cipher Suite: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0x0035)

As you can see 0xc02f and 0xc030 match, but the next TLSv1.2 packet says: Alert (21), Handshake Failure (40).
Update 2:
These are the curves from Android 5.1 in the ClientHello:

Elliptic curves (25 curves)

Elliptic curve: sect571r1 (0x000e)
Elliptic curve: sect571k1 (0x000d)
Elliptic curve: secp521r1 (0x0019)
Elliptic curve: sect409k1 (0x000b)
Elliptic curve: sect409r1 (0x000c)
Elliptic curve: secp384r1 (0x0018)
Elliptic curve: sect283k1 (0x0009)
Elliptic curve: sect283r1 (0x000a)
Elliptic curve: secp256k1 (0x0016)
Elliptic curve: secp256r1 (0x0017)
Elliptic curve: sect239k1 (0x0008)
Elliptic curve: sect233k1 (0x0006)
Elliptic curve: sect233r1 (0x0007)
Elliptic curve: secp224k1 (0x0014)
Elliptic curve: secp224r1 (0x0015)
Elliptic curve: sect193r1 (0x0004)
Elliptic curve: sect193r2 (0x0005)
Elliptic curve: secp192k1 (0x0012)
Elliptic curve: secp192r1 (0x0013)
Elliptic curve: sect163k1 (0x0001)
Elliptic curve: sect163r1 (0x0002)
Elliptic curve: sect163r2 (0x0003)
Elliptic curve: secp160k1 (0x000f)
Elliptic curve: secp160r1 (0x0010)
Elliptic curve: secp160r2 (0x0011)

In the ServerHello secp384r1 (0x0018) is returned.
And this is from Android 7:

Elliptic curves (1 curve)

Elliptic curve: secp256r1 (0x0017)

Resulting in the Handshake Failure.
Changing the nginx configuration by removing secp384r1 or replacing it with the default (prime256v1) does get it to work. So I guess the question remains: am I able to add elliptic curves ?
The captured data is the same when using the emulator as when using an Android 7.0 device (General Mobile 4G).
Update 3:
Small update, but worth mentioning: I got it to work in the emulator using Android 7.1.1 (!). It shows the following data (again, grabbed using tcpdump and viewed using wireshark):

Elliptic curves (3 curves)

Elliptic curve: secp256r1 (0x0017)
Elliptic curve: secp384r1 (0x0018)
Elliptic curve: secp512r1 (0x0019)

It shows the same 18 Cipher Suites.
","Here you working solution for Volley:
before you create queue in singleton codes:
public class VolleyServiceSingleton {

    private RequestQueue mRequestQueue;
    private HurlStack mStack;

    private VolleyServiceSingleton(){

        SSLSocketFactoryExtended factory = null;

        try {
            factory = new SSLSocketFactoryExtended();
        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (KeyManagementException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }


        final SSLSocketFactoryExtended finalFactory = factory;
        mStack = new HurlStack() {
            @Override
            protected HttpURLConnection createConnection(URL url) throws IOException {
                HttpsURLConnection httpsURLConnection = (HttpsURLConnection) super.createConnection(url);
                try {
                    httpsURLConnection.setSSLSocketFactory(finalFactory);
                    httpsURLConnection.setRequestProperty(""charset"", ""utf-8"");

                } catch (Exception e) {

                return httpsURLConnection;

        };



        mRequestQueue = Volley.newRequestQueue(YourApplication.getContext(), mStack, -1);

}

in this codes I simple add all Ciphers that are supported by device, for me this works ), may be will help someone ) Cheers )
p.s. no need to add security network config parameter in manifest.

"39133437","SSLHandshakeException: Handshake failed on Android N/7.0","I'm working on an app for which the (power)users have to set up their own server (i.e. nginx) to run the backend application. The corresponding domain needs to be configured in the app so it can connect. I've been testing primarily on my own phone (sony z3c) and started developing for 5.1. Later I received an update for 6.0 but still maintained a working 5.1 inside the emulator. Not too long ago, I started to work on an AVD with an image for 7.0 and to my suprise it won't connect to my server, telling me the ssl handshake failed. My nginx configuration is pretty strict, but it works for both 5.1 and 6.0, so .... ?!
Here is what I know:

I use v24 for support libs, i.e. my compileSdkVersion is 24.
I use Volley v1.0.0.
I've tried the TLSSocketFactory, but it doesn't change anything. This seems to be used most of the times to prevent SSL3 use for older SDK versions anyway.
I've tried increasing the timeout, but it doesn't change anything.
I've tried using HttpURLConnection directly, but it doesn't change anything apart from the stack trace (it's without the volley references, but identical otherwise).

Without the TLSSocketFactory the request are made through a bare request queue, instantiated with Volley.newRequestQueue(context).
This is what I see in android studio:

Since it says SSLV3_ALERT_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE I can only assume it for some reason tries to connect using SSLv3 and fails, but this doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever. It might be a cipher-issue, but how can I tell what it is trying to use ? I would rather not enable a ciphers on the server, make a connection attempt and repeat.
My nginx site uses a let's encrypt certificate and has the following configuration:
ssl_stapling on;
ssl_stapling_verify on;
ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/lets-encrypt-x1-cross-signed.pem;
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!aNULL;
ssl_dhparam /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem;
ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;

To test these ciphers I've a script and it confirms these ciphers (run on a wheezy vps outside the server's network):

I can open the server-url in the emulator's browser and get a perfect json response so I know the system itself is capable.
So the question is, why can't I connect on Android 7 ?
Update:
I've looked at a captured packet using tcpdump and wireshark and the enabled ciphers are in the ClientHello, so that should not be a problem.

Cipher Suites (18 suites)

Cipher Suite: Unknown (0xcca9)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xc02b)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0xc02c)
Cipher Suite: Unknown (0xcca8)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xc02f)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0xc030)
Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0x009e)
Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0x009f)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0xc009)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0xc00a)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0xc013)

Cipher Suite: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0x002f)
Cipher Suite: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0x0035)

As you can see 0xc02f and 0xc030 match, but the next TLSv1.2 packet says: Alert (21), Handshake Failure (40).
Update 2:
These are the curves from Android 5.1 in the ClientHello:

Elliptic curves (25 curves)

Elliptic curve: sect571r1 (0x000e)
Elliptic curve: sect571k1 (0x000d)
Elliptic curve: secp521r1 (0x0019)
Elliptic curve: sect409k1 (0x000b)
Elliptic curve: sect409r1 (0x000c)
Elliptic curve: secp384r1 (0x0018)
Elliptic curve: sect283k1 (0x0009)
Elliptic curve: sect283r1 (0x000a)
Elliptic curve: secp256k1 (0x0016)
Elliptic curve: secp256r1 (0x0017)
Elliptic curve: sect239k1 (0x0008)
Elliptic curve: sect233k1 (0x0006)
Elliptic curve: sect233r1 (0x0007)
Elliptic curve: secp224k1 (0x0014)
Elliptic curve: secp224r1 (0x0015)
Elliptic curve: sect193r1 (0x0004)
Elliptic curve: sect193r2 (0x0005)
Elliptic curve: secp192k1 (0x0012)
Elliptic curve: secp192r1 (0x0013)
Elliptic curve: sect163k1 (0x0001)
Elliptic curve: sect163r1 (0x0002)
Elliptic curve: sect163r2 (0x0003)
Elliptic curve: secp160k1 (0x000f)
Elliptic curve: secp160r1 (0x0010)
Elliptic curve: secp160r2 (0x0011)

In the ServerHello secp384r1 (0x0018) is returned.
And this is from Android 7:

Elliptic curves (1 curve)

Elliptic curve: secp256r1 (0x0017)

Resulting in the Handshake Failure.
Changing the nginx configuration by removing secp384r1 or replacing it with the default (prime256v1) does get it to work. So I guess the question remains: am I able to add elliptic curves ?
The captured data is the same when using the emulator as when using an Android 7.0 device (General Mobile 4G).
Update 3:
Small update, but worth mentioning: I got it to work in the emulator using Android 7.1.1 (!). It shows the following data (again, grabbed using tcpdump and viewed using wireshark):

Elliptic curves (3 curves)

Elliptic curve: secp256r1 (0x0017)
Elliptic curve: secp384r1 (0x0018)
Elliptic curve: secp512r1 (0x0019)

It shows the same 18 Cipher Suites.
","I had the problem with a Self Signed Certificate and the issue was in the cipher which wasn't accepted by Android 7.0
I ran: openssl s_client -showcerts -connect <domain>:<port>
in the result I found: 
Protocol : TLSv1
Cipher   : DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA

I searched for the Android Equivalent of the Cipher and added it to my Retrofit Restadapter: 
ConnectionSpec spec = new ConnectionSpec.Builder(ConnectionSpec.MODERN_TLS)
            .tlsVersions(TlsVersion.TLS_1_2)
            .cipherSuites(

CipherSuite.TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA)
            .build();

clientBuilder.connectionSpecs(Collections.singletonList(spec));

From here every connection with the correct certificate pinning or a correct certificate but with the 'wrong' cipher according to Android 7.0 was accepted. 

When looking back at this answer a year later I have to admit I'm still happy I posted it, on the other hand, if you are in the position to change the certificate to the correct Cypher suite please do this always over ""downgrading"" te accepted suites in your app. If you have to work with a self-signed certificate (for example for embedded) this is a working solution for you.

"39133437","SSLHandshakeException: Handshake failed on Android N/7.0","I'm working on an app for which the (power)users have to set up their own server (i.e. nginx) to run the backend application. The corresponding domain needs to be configured in the app so it can connect. I've been testing primarily on my own phone (sony z3c) and started developing for 5.1. Later I received an update for 6.0 but still maintained a working 5.1 inside the emulator. Not too long ago, I started to work on an AVD with an image for 7.0 and to my suprise it won't connect to my server, telling me the ssl handshake failed. My nginx configuration is pretty strict, but it works for both 5.1 and 6.0, so .... ?!
Here is what I know:

I use v24 for support libs, i.e. my compileSdkVersion is 24.
I use Volley v1.0.0.
I've tried the TLSSocketFactory, but it doesn't change anything. This seems to be used most of the times to prevent SSL3 use for older SDK versions anyway.
I've tried increasing the timeout, but it doesn't change anything.
I've tried using HttpURLConnection directly, but it doesn't change anything apart from the stack trace (it's without the volley references, but identical otherwise).

Without the TLSSocketFactory the request are made through a bare request queue, instantiated with Volley.newRequestQueue(context).
This is what I see in android studio:

I can open the server-url in the emulator's browser and get a perfect json response so I know the system itself is capable.
So the question is, why can't I connect on Android 7 ?
Update:
I've looked at a captured packet using tcpdump and wireshark and the enabled ciphers are in the ClientHello, so that should not be a problem.

Cipher Suites (18 suites)

Cipher Suite: Unknown (0xcca9)

As you can see 0xc02f and 0xc030 match, but the next TLSv1.2 packet says: Alert (21), Handshake Failure (40).
Update 2:
These are the curves from Android 5.1 in the ClientHello:

Elliptic curves (25 curves)

Elliptic curve: sect571r1 (0x000e)
Elliptic curve: sect571k1 (0x000d)
Elliptic curve: secp521r1 (0x0019)
Elliptic curve: sect409k1 (0x000b)
Elliptic curve: sect409r1 (0x000c)
Elliptic curve: secp384r1 (0x0018)
Elliptic curve: sect283k1 (0x0009)
Elliptic curve: sect283r1 (0x000a)

Elliptic curve: sect233r1 (0x0007)
Elliptic curve: secp224k1 (0x0014)
Elliptic curve: secp224r1 (0x0015)
Elliptic curve: sect193r1 (0x0004)
Elliptic curve: sect193r2 (0x0005)

Elliptic curve: secp160k1 (0x000f)
Elliptic curve: secp160r1 (0x0010)
Elliptic curve: secp160r2 (0x0011)

In the ServerHello secp384r1 (0x0018) is returned.
And this is from Android 7:

Elliptic curves (1 curve)

Elliptic curve: secp256r1 (0x0017)

Resulting in the Handshake Failure.
Changing the nginx configuration by removing secp384r1 or replacing it with the default (prime256v1) does get it to work. So I guess the question remains: am I able to add elliptic curves ?
The captured data is the same when using the emulator as when using an Android 7.0 device (General Mobile 4G).
Update 3:
Small update, but worth mentioning: I got it to work in the emulator using Android 7.1.1 (!). It shows the following data (again, grabbed using tcpdump and viewed using wireshark):

Elliptic curves (3 curves)

Elliptic curve: secp256r1 (0x0017)
Elliptic curve: secp384r1 (0x0018)
Elliptic curve: secp512r1 (0x0019)

It shows the same 18 Cipher Suites.
","This is a known regression in Android 7.0, acknowledged by Google and fixed sometime before the release of Android 7.1.1. Here is the bug report: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=224438.
To be clear, the bug here is that 7.0 only supports ONE elliptic curve: prime256v1 aka secp256r1 aka NIST P-256, as Cornelis points out in the question. So if your users are facing this issue, these are the workarounds available to you (ignoring the fact that your users should ideally just upgrade to Android 7.1.1):

Configure your server to use the elliptic curve prime256v1. For example, in Nginx 1.10 you do this by setting ssl_ecdh_curve prime256v1;.
If that doesn't work, use older cipher suites that don't rely on elliptic-curve cryptography (e.g., DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384) (make sure you understand what you're doing here in terms of data security)

NOTE: I am not an expert in elliptic-curve cryptography, make sure to do your own research on the security implications of my suggestions. Here are some other links I referred to while writing this answer:

"39133437","SSLHandshakeException: Handshake failed on Android N/7.0","I'm working on an app for which the (power)users have to set up their own server (i.e. nginx) to run the backend application. The corresponding domain needs to be configured in the app so it can connect. I've been testing primarily on my own phone (sony z3c) and started developing for 5.1. Later I received an update for 6.0 but still maintained a working 5.1 inside the emulator. Not too long ago, I started to work on an AVD with an image for 7.0 and to my suprise it won't connect to my server, telling me the ssl handshake failed. My nginx configuration is pretty strict, but it works for both 5.1 and 6.0, so .... ?!
Here is what I know:

I use v24 for support libs, i.e. my compileSdkVersion is 24.
I use Volley v1.0.0.
I've tried the TLSSocketFactory, but it doesn't change anything. This seems to be used most of the times to prevent SSL3 use for older SDK versions anyway.
I've tried increasing the timeout, but it doesn't change anything.
I've tried using HttpURLConnection directly, but it doesn't change anything apart from the stack trace (it's without the volley references, but identical otherwise).

Without the TLSSocketFactory the request are made through a bare request queue, instantiated with Volley.newRequestQueue(context).
This is what I see in android studio:

Since it says SSLV3_ALERT_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE I can only assume it for some reason tries to connect using SSLv3 and fails, but this doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever. It might be a cipher-issue, but how can I tell what it is trying to use ? I would rather not enable a ciphers on the server, make a connection attempt and repeat.
My nginx site uses a let's encrypt certificate and has the following configuration:
ssl_stapling on;
ssl_stapling_verify on;
ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/lets-encrypt-x1-cross-signed.pem;
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!aNULL;
ssl_dhparam /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem;
ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;

To test these ciphers I've a script and it confirms these ciphers (run on a wheezy vps outside the server's network):

I can open the server-url in the emulator's browser and get a perfect json response so I know the system itself is capable.
So the question is, why can't I connect on Android 7 ?
Update:
I've looked at a captured packet using tcpdump and wireshark and the enabled ciphers are in the ClientHello, so that should not be a problem.

Cipher Suites (18 suites)

Cipher Suite: Unknown (0xcca9)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xc02b)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0xc02c)

Cipher Suite: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0x002f)
Cipher Suite: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0x0035)

As you can see 0xc02f and 0xc030 match, but the next TLSv1.2 packet says: Alert (21), Handshake Failure (40).
Update 2:
These are the curves from Android 5.1 in the ClientHello:

Elliptic curves (25 curves)

Elliptic curve: sect571r1 (0x000e)
Elliptic curve: sect571k1 (0x000d)
Elliptic curve: secp521r1 (0x0019)
Elliptic curve: sect409k1 (0x000b)
Elliptic curve: sect409r1 (0x000c)
Elliptic curve: secp384r1 (0x0018)
Elliptic curve: sect283k1 (0x0009)
Elliptic curve: sect283r1 (0x000a)
Elliptic curve: secp256k1 (0x0016)
Elliptic curve: secp256r1 (0x0017)
Elliptic curve: sect239k1 (0x0008)
Elliptic curve: sect233k1 (0x0006)
Elliptic curve: sect233r1 (0x0007)
Elliptic curve: secp224k1 (0x0014)
Elliptic curve: secp224r1 (0x0015)
Elliptic curve: sect193r1 (0x0004)
Elliptic curve: sect193r2 (0x0005)
Elliptic curve: secp192k1 (0x0012)
Elliptic curve: secp192r1 (0x0013)
Elliptic curve: sect163k1 (0x0001)
Elliptic curve: sect163r1 (0x0002)
Elliptic curve: sect163r2 (0x0003)
Elliptic curve: secp160k1 (0x000f)
Elliptic curve: secp160r1 (0x0010)
Elliptic curve: secp160r2 (0x0011)

In the ServerHello secp384r1 (0x0018) is returned.
And this is from Android 7:

Elliptic curves (1 curve)

Elliptic curve: secp256r1 (0x0017)

Resulting in the Handshake Failure.
Changing the nginx configuration by removing secp384r1 or replacing it with the default (prime256v1) does get it to work. So I guess the question remains: am I able to add elliptic curves ?
The captured data is the same when using the emulator as when using an Android 7.0 device (General Mobile 4G).
Update 3:
Small update, but worth mentioning: I got it to work in the emulator using Android 7.1.1 (!). It shows the following data (again, grabbed using tcpdump and viewed using wireshark):

Elliptic curves (3 curves)

Elliptic curve: secp256r1 (0x0017)
Elliptic curve: secp384r1 (0x0018)
Elliptic curve: secp512r1 (0x0019)

It shows the same 18 Cipher Suites.
","Same here. My Nginx server using sll_ecdh_curve prime384v1 setting. Unfortunately, backend guy not allowed me to configure the Nginx server following Vicky Chijwani's instructions due to Client's secirity policies. I was tried to use Valley and the latest version of the OkHttp library, but it did not help. 
To bypass that bug, I had to use WebView to communicate with the API Service on Adroid 7.0 devices. Here is my Adapter class. I hope someone else will find it useful.

"39133437","SSLHandshakeException: Handshake failed on Android N/7.0","I'm working on an app for which the (power)users have to set up their own server (i.e. nginx) to run the backend application. The corresponding domain needs to be configured in the app so it can connect. I've been testing primarily on my own phone (sony z3c) and started developing for 5.1. Later I received an update for 6.0 but still maintained a working 5.1 inside the emulator. Not too long ago, I started to work on an AVD with an image for 7.0 and to my suprise it won't connect to my server, telling me the ssl handshake failed. My nginx configuration is pretty strict, but it works for both 5.1 and 6.0, so .... ?!
Here is what I know:

I use v24 for support libs, i.e. my compileSdkVersion is 24.
I use Volley v1.0.0.
I've tried the TLSSocketFactory, but it doesn't change anything. This seems to be used most of the times to prevent SSL3 use for older SDK versions anyway.
I've tried increasing the timeout, but it doesn't change anything.
I've tried using HttpURLConnection directly, but it doesn't change anything apart from the stack trace (it's without the volley references, but identical otherwise).

Without the TLSSocketFactory the request are made through a bare request queue, instantiated with Volley.newRequestQueue(context).
This is what I see in android studio:

Since it says SSLV3_ALERT_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE I can only assume it for some reason tries to connect using SSLv3 and fails, but this doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever. It might be a cipher-issue, but how can I tell what it is trying to use ? I would rather not enable a ciphers on the server, make a connection attempt and repeat.
My nginx site uses a let's encrypt certificate and has the following configuration:
ssl_stapling on;
ssl_stapling_verify on;
ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/lets-encrypt-x1-cross-signed.pem;
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!aNULL;
ssl_dhparam /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem;
ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;

To test these ciphers I've a script and it confirms these ciphers (run on a wheezy vps outside the server's network):

I can open the server-url in the emulator's browser and get a perfect json response so I know the system itself is capable.
So the question is, why can't I connect on Android 7 ?
Update:
I've looked at a captured packet using tcpdump and wireshark and the enabled ciphers are in the ClientHello, so that should not be a problem.

"39133437","SSLHandshakeException: Handshake failed on Android N/7.0","I'm working on an app for which the (power)users have to set up their own server (i.e. nginx) to run the backend application. The corresponding domain needs to be configured in the app so it can connect. I've been testing primarily on my own phone (sony z3c) and started developing for 5.1. Later I received an update for 6.0 but still maintained a working 5.1 inside the emulator. Not too long ago, I started to work on an AVD with an image for 7.0 and to my suprise it won't connect to my server, telling me the ssl handshake failed. My nginx configuration is pretty strict, but it works for both 5.1 and 6.0, so .... ?!
Here is what I know:

I use v24 for support libs, i.e. my compileSdkVersion is 24.
I use Volley v1.0.0.
I've tried the TLSSocketFactory, but it doesn't change anything. This seems to be used most of the times to prevent SSL3 use for older SDK versions anyway.
I've tried increasing the timeout, but it doesn't change anything.
I've tried using HttpURLConnection directly, but it doesn't change anything apart from the stack trace (it's without the volley references, but identical otherwise).

Without the TLSSocketFactory the request are made through a bare request queue, instantiated with Volley.newRequestQueue(context).
This is what I see in android studio:

Since it says SSLV3_ALERT_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE I can only assume it for some reason tries to connect using SSLv3 and fails, but this doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever. It might be a cipher-issue, but how can I tell what it is trying to use ? I would rather not enable a ciphers on the server, make a connection attempt and repeat.
My nginx site uses a let's encrypt certificate and has the following configuration:
ssl_stapling on;
ssl_stapling_verify on;
ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/lets-encrypt-x1-cross-signed.pem;
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!aNULL;
ssl_dhparam /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem;
ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;

To test these ciphers I've a script and it confirms these ciphers (run on a wheezy vps outside the server's network):

I can open the server-url in the emulator's browser and get a perfect json response so I know the system itself is capable.
So the question is, why can't I connect on Android 7 ?

I've looked at a captured packet using tcpdump and wireshark and the enabled ciphers are in the ClientHello, so that should not be a problem.

The corresponding domain needs to be configured in the app so it can connect. I've been testing primarily on my own phone (sony z3c) and started developing for 5.1. Later I received an update for 6.0 but still maintained a working 5.1 inside the emulator. Not too long ago, I started to work on an AVD with an image for 7.0 and to my suprise it won't connect to my server, telling me the ssl handshake failed. My nginx configuration is pretty strict, but it works for both 5.1 and 6.0, so .... ?!
Here is what I know:

I use v24 for support libs, i.e. my compileSdkVersion is 24.
I use Volley v1.0.0.
I've tried the TLSSocketFactory, but it doesn't change anything. This seems to be used most of the times to prevent SSL3 use for older SDK versions anyway.
I've tried increasing the timeout, but it doesn't change anything.
I've tried using HttpURLConnection directly, but it doesn't change anything apart from the stack trace (it's without the volley references, but identical otherwise).

Without the TLSSocketFactory the request are made through a bare request queue, instantiated with Volley.newRequestQueue(context).
This is what I see in android studio:

Since it says SSLV3_ALERT_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE I can only assume it for some reason tries to connect using SSLv3 and fails, but this doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever. It might be a cipher-issue, but how can I tell what it is trying to use ? I would rather not enable a ciphers on the server, make a connection attempt and repeat.
My nginx site uses a let's encrypt certificate and has the following configuration:
ssl_stapling on;
ssl_stapling_verify on;
ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/lets-encrypt-x1-cross-signed.pem;
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!aNULL;
ssl_dhparam /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem;
ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;

To test these ciphers I've a script and it confirms these ciphers (run on a wheezy vps outside the server's network):

I can open the server-url in the emulator's browser and get a perfect json response so I know the system itself is capable.
So the question is, why can't I connect on Android 7 ?
Update:
I've looked at a captured packet using tcpdump and wireshark and the enabled ciphers are in the ClientHello, so that should not be a problem.

As you can see 0xc02f and 0xc030 match, but the next TLSv1.2 packet says: Alert (21), Handshake Failure (40).
Update 2:
These are the curves from Android 5.1 in the ClientHello:

Elliptic curves (25 curves)

Elliptic curve: sect571r1 (0x000e)
Elliptic curve: sect571k1 (0x000d)
Elliptic curve: secp521r1 (0x0019)
Elliptic curve: sect409k1 (0x000b)
Elliptic curve: sect409r1 (0x000c)
Elliptic curve: secp384r1 (0x0018)
Elliptic curve: sect283k1 (0x0009)
Elliptic curve: sect283r1 (0x000a)
Elliptic curve: secp256k1 (0x0016)
Elliptic curve: secp256r1 (0x0017)
Elliptic curve: sect239k1 (0x0008)
Elliptic curve: sect233k1 (0x0006)
Elliptic curve: sect233r1 (0x0007)
Elliptic curve: secp224k1 (0x0014)
Elliptic curve: secp224r1 (0x0015)
Elliptic curve: sect193r1 (0x0004)
Elliptic curve: sect193r2 (0x0005)
Elliptic curve: secp192k1 (0x0012)
Elliptic curve: secp192r1 (0x0013)
Elliptic curve: sect163k1 (0x0001)
Elliptic curve: sect163r1 (0x0002)
Elliptic curve: sect163r2 (0x0003)
Elliptic curve: secp160k1 (0x000f)
Elliptic curve: secp160r1 (0x0010)
Elliptic curve: secp160r2 (0x0011)

In the ServerHello secp384r1 (0x0018) is returned.
And this is from Android 7:

Elliptic curves (1 curve)

Elliptic curve: secp256r1 (0x0017)

Resulting in the Handshake Failure.
Changing the nginx configuration by removing secp384r1 or replacing it with the default (prime256v1) does get it to work. So I guess the question remains: am I able to add elliptic curves ?
The captured data is the same when using the emulator as when using an Android 7.0 device (General Mobile 4G).
Update 3:
Small update, but worth mentioning: I got it to work in the emulator using Android 7.1.1 (!). It shows the following data (again, grabbed using tcpdump and viewed using wireshark):

Elliptic curves (3 curves)

Elliptic curve: secp256r1 (0x0017)
Elliptic curve: secp384r1 (0x0018)
Elliptic curve: secp512r1 (0x0019)

It shows the same 18 Cipher Suites.
","I spent 4 days around this problem and tried everything, the problem I had was with using LetsEncrypt (certbot etc.) to generate my certificates.

The function get_ec_group_192() is created by running openssl ecparam -C -name secp192k1 -genkey which also generates some EC PARAMETERS and a EC PRIVATE KEY.
What I am trying to do is to encrypt the message contained in hash with my private key so that only public key can decrypt it. Is that possible with the above code, or am I doing this completely wrong?
","Their is a small bug in the above code. The hash that is passed is an unsigned char, this hash CAN have 0x00 values in it! Do NOT use the strlen(hash) to calculate the length, as that will possibly pass the incorrect length to the routine IF the hash has a 0x00 in it anywhere. Hashes are fixed length, and should be passed as such. sha256 for example should be of length 64.

"6045559","Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) with bouncy castle for asymmetric encryption","I want to use ECC in order to exchange a Session Key for a long-term data transmission. This key exchange should be encrypted using ECC-192bit (curvename: prime192v1). That means that i want to implement an own hybrid encryption model.
Therefore i used bouncy castle for JAVA. I implemented ECDSA and it works fine. I implemented the AES-128 bit symmetric encryption and this also works fine. But i cant implement a simple Asymmetric encryption using ECC.
So my question: Can this asymmetric encryption implemented with bouncy castle at all?

Bernstein suggests to use ECDSA for this but I could not find any code.  
","ECDSA is specified by ANSI X9.62. That standard defines the kind of curves on which ECDSA is defined, including details curve equations, key representations and so on. These do not match Curve25519: part of the optimizations which make Curve25519 faster than standard curves of the same size rely on the special curve equation, which does not enter in X9.62 formalism. Correspondingly, there cannot be any implementation of ECDSA which both conforms to ANSI X9.62, and uses Curve25519. In practice, I know of no implementation of an ECDSA-like algorithm on Curve25519.
To be brief, you are on your own. You may want to implement ECDSA over the Curve25519 implementation by following X9.62 (there a draft from 1998 which can be downloaded from several places, e.g. there, or you can spend a hundred bucks and get the genuine 2005 version from Techstreet). But be warned that you are walking outside of the carefully trodden paths of analyzed cryptography; in other words I explicitly deny any kind of guarantee on how secure that kind-of-ECDSA would be.
My advice would be to stick to standard curves (such as NIST P-256). Note that while Curve25519 is faster than most curves of the same size, smaller standard curves will be faster, and yet provide adequate security for most purposes. NIST P-192, for instance, provides ""96-bit security"", somewhat similar to 1536-bit RSA. Also, standard curves already provide performance on the order of several thousands signature per second on a small PC, and I have trouble imagining a scenario where more performance is needed.

","To use Curve25519 for this, you'd have to implement a lot of functions that AFAIK aren't currently implemented anywhere for this curve, which would mean getting very substantially into the mathematics of elliptic curve cryptography.  The reason is that the existing functions throw away the ""y"" coordinate of the point and work only with the ""x"" coordinate.  Without the ""y"" coordinate, the points P and -P look the same.  That's fine for ECDH which Curve25519 is designed for, because |x(yG)| = |x(-yG)|.  But for ECDSA you need to calculate aG + bP, and |aG + bP| does not in general equal |aG - bP|. I've looked into what would be involved in extending curve25519-donna to support such calculations; it's doable, but far from trivial.
Since what you need most of all is fast verification, I recommend Bernstein's Rabin-Williams scheme.

Base58 Bitcoin address ""hash""
1Kb76YK9a4mhrif766m321AMocNvzeQxqV

Since the Base58 Bitcoin address is just a hash, I can't use it for validation of a Bitcoin message.  However, it is possible to extract the public key from a signature.
Edit: I'm emphasizing that I'm deriving the Public key from the signature itself, and not from the Base58 public key hash.  If I want to (and I actually do want to) I should be able to convert these public key bits into the Base58 hash.  I don't need assistance in doing this, I just need help in extracting the public key bits and verifying the signature.
Question

In the Signature above, what format is this signature in? PKCS10?  (Answer: no, it's proprietary as described here) 
how do I extract the public key in Bouncy Castle?
What is the correct way to verify the signature?  (assume that I already know how to convert the Public Key bits into a hash that equals the Bitcoin hash above)

Prior research
This link describes how to use ECDSA curves, and the following code will allow me to convert a public key into a BC object, but I'm unsure on how to get the point Q from the signature.  
In the sample below Q is the hard coded value

        params);
  PublicKey  pubKey = f.generatePublic(pubKeySpec);


 var signer = SignerUtilities.GetSigner(""ECDSA""); // possibly similar to SHA-1withECDSA
 signer.Init(false, pubKey);
 signer.BlockUpdate(plainTextAsBytes, 0, plainTextAsBytes.Length);
 return signer.VerifySignature(signature);


Additional research:
THIS is the Bitcoin source that verifies a message.
After decoding the Base64 of the signature, the RecoverCompact(hash of message, signature) is called.  I'm not a C++ programmer so I'm assuming I need to figure out how key.Recover works.  That or key.GetPubKey
This is the C++ code that I think I need in C#, ideally in bouncy castle... but I'll take anything that works.

Custom signature format in Bitcoin
This answer says there are 4 possible public keys that can produce a signature, and this is encoded in the newer signatures.
","I'm afraid there are some problems with your sample data. First of all your sample Q is 61 bytes long, but Bitcoin public keys (using secp256k1 curve) should be 65 bytes in their uncompressed form. The Q you supplied does not verify the message correctly, but the Q I have calculated does seem to verify it.
I wrote code that calculates the correct public key for string ""StackOverflow test 123"" and verifies it using ECDsaSigner. However, the hash for this public key is 1HRDe7G7tn925iNxQaeD7R2ZkZiKowN8NW instead of 1Kb76YK9a4mhrif766m321AMocNvzeQxqV.
Can you please verify that your data is correct and maybe give the exact hash of the message string so that we could try to debug, an incorrect hash can mess things up quite bad. The code I have used is following:

This answer says there are 4 possible public keys that can produce a signature, and this is encoded in the newer signatures.
","After referencing BitcoinJ, it appears some of these code samples are missing proper preparation of the message, double-SHA256 hashing, and possible compressed encoding of the recovered public point that is input to the address calculation.
The following code should only need BouncyCastle (probably you'll need recent version from github, not sure). It borrows a few things from BitcoinJ, and does just does enough to get small examples working, see inline comments for message size restrictions.
It only calculates up to the RIPEMD-160 hash, and I used http://gobittest.appspot.com/Address to check the final address that results (unfortunately that website doesn't seem to support entering a compressed encoding for the public key).

"4969570","Is there a difference between ECDH and ECDSA keys?","I'm building a network application that uses BouncyCastle as a cryptography provider.  Let's say you have this to generate a keypair:
ECParameterSpec ecSpec = ECNamedCurveTable.getParameterSpec(""prime192v1"");
KeyPairGenerator g = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""ECDSA"", ""BC"");
g.initialize(ecSpec, new SecureRandom());
KeyPair pair = g.generateKeyPair();

I'm confused as to why you're getting an instance of an ECDSA KeyPairGenerator.  Why doesn't it just say EC?  I know that there's an ECDH Key type that is shipped with BouncyCastle, but I thought that the two represented the same stuff about the points on the curve --  or am I completely wrong with the theory behind it?
The reason that I ask is that right now my application uses ECDH fine to establish an AES secret key, but now I want to use the same EC key to sign each message using ECDSA.
","ECDSA and ECDH are from distinct standards (ANSI X9.62 and X9.63, respectively), and used in distinct contexts. X9.63 explicitly reuses elements from X9.62, including the standard representation of public keys (e.g. in X.509 certificates). Hence, ECDSA and ECDH key pairs are largely interchangeable. Whether a given implementation will permit such exchange, however, is an open question. Historically, (EC)DSA and (EC)DH come from distinct worlds.
Note, though, that usage contexts are quite distinct. There is a bit more to cryptography than computations on elliptic curves; the ""key lifecycle"" must be taken into account. In plain words, you do not want to manage key agreement keys and signature keys with the same procedures. For instance, if you lose your key agreement key (your dog eats your smartcard -- do not laugh, it really happens), then you can no longer decrypt data which was encrypted relatively to that key (e.g. encrypted emails sent to you, and stored in encrypted format). From a business point of view, the loss of a key can also be the loss of an employee (the employee was fired, and was struck by a bus, or retired, or whatever). Hence, encryption keys (including key agreement keys) must often be escrowed (for instance, a copy of the private key is printed and stored in a safe). On the other hand, loss of a signature key implies no data loss; previously issued signatures can still be verified; recovering from such a loss is as simple as creating a new key pair. However, the existence of an escrow system tends to automatically strip signatures of any legal value that could be attached to them.
Also, on a more general basis, I would strongly advise against using the same private key in two distinct algorithms: interactions between algorithms have not been fully explored (simply studying one algorithm is already hard work). For instance, what happens if someone begins to feed your ECDH-based protocol with curve points extracted from ECDSA signatures which you computed with the same private key ?
So you really should not reuse the same key for ECDH and ECDSA.

"18155559","How does one access the raw ECDH public key, private key and params inside OpenSSL's EVP_PKEY structure?","I'm using OpenSSL's c library to generate an elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key pair, following the first code sample here. It glosses over the actual exchange of public keys with this line:
peerkey = get_peerkey(pkey);

The pkey variable and the return value are both of type EVP *. pkey contains the public key, private key, and params generated earlier, and the return value only contains the peer's public key. So this raises three questions:

How would get_peerkey() actually extract just the public key from pkey for sending to the peer?
How would the code extract the private key and params from pKey to store them for later use after the key exchange?
How would get_peerkey() generate a new EVP_PKEY structure from the peer's raw public key?

I've seen the OpenSSL functions EVP_PKEY_print_public(), EVP_PKEY_print_private(), and EVP_PKEY_print_params() but these are for generating human-readable output. And I haven't found any equivalent for converting a human-readable public key back into an EVP_PKEY structure.
","To answer my own question, there's a different path for the private key and the public key.
To serialize the public key:

Pass the EVP_PKEY to EVP_PKEY_get1_EC_KEY() to get an EC_KEY.
Pass the EC_KEY to EC_KEY_get0_public_key() to get an EC_POINT.
Pass the EC_POINT to EC_POINT_point2oct() to get octets, which are just unsigned char *.

To deserialize the public key:

Pass the octets to EC_POINT_oct2point() to get an EC_POINT.
Pass the EC_POINT to EC_KEY_set_public_key() to get an EC_KEY.
Pass the EC_KEY to EVP_PKEY_set1_EC_KEY to get an EVP_KEY.

To serialize the private key:

Pass the EVP_PKEY to EVP_PKEY_get1_EC_KEY() to get an EC_KEY.
Pass the EC_KEY to EC_KEY_get0_private_key() to get a BIGNUM. 
Pass the BIGNUM to BN_bn2mpi() to get an mpi, which is a format written to
unsigned char *.

To deserialize the private key:

Pass the mpi to BN_mpi2bn() to get a BIGNUM.
Pass the BIGNUM to EC_KEY_set_private_key() to get an EC_KEY.
Pass the EC_KEY to EVP_PKEY_set1_EC_KEY to get an EVP_KEY.

It is also possible to convert the BIGNUM to hex, decimal, or ""bin"", although I think that mpi used the fewest bytes.

You do get the parameters, but apparently no longer linked to the OID, which might make a difference.
In particular it may be treated as ""arbitrary"" or ""explicit"" in TLS and not work 
even though the TLS parties support that same curve by name.
Note that openssl uses the name prime256v1 but not everyone does. Java (sun.) uses secp256r1, or the OID.
If you are actually getting this pubkey from openssl, note that JCE can directly read the X.509 
SubjectPublicKeyInfo format, which openssl calls PUBKEY, including the named (OID) form.

I want to read the public key into a byte array in C...

Well, the key on disk is likely PEM encoded. Because its a public key, it probably has the pre- and post- encapsulated boundaries of -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- and -----END PUBLIC KEY-----. You can read it like that using standard library functions.
You can also read the public key with PEM_read_PUBKEY. The function returns a EVP_PKEY*. I believe you can convert the EVP_PKEY* to a EC_KEY* with:
EC_KEY* ecKey = EVP_PKEY_get1_EC_KEY(pKey);

The get1 above means the reference count on the key was bumped (as opposed to get0). Be sure to call EC_KEY_free when done with it.
I'm not sure how you would read the public key into an array given a EVP_PKEY* or EC_KEY*. At minimum, there are two pieces of information: the curve (like secp256k1) and the public element (a point on the curve, which consists of an (x,y) coordinate). If the named curve (i.e., the OID) is not present (i.e., the absence of the OPENSSL_EC_NAMED_CURVE flag), then you have all the domain parameters like p, a, b, G, etc. Perhaps you should look at an ASN.1/DER encoding. I think that's the closet you are going to get.

","GregS mentioned in his comment that a*(bP) is not equal to P just because ab = 1 mod q in the underlying field F_q. 
Actually the correct statement would be: a*(bP) is equal to P if ab = 1 mod n (n is the order of group G). 
Also the code ChaiaraHsieh suggested seems correct (just change k = kin.mod(p) to k = kin.mod(n) in the ScalarMultiply code).

","Java's default encoding for a PublicKey is ""X.509"" which is not just the EC point; it is an ASN.1 structure identifying the algorithm (EC) and parameters (here prime256v1) PLUS a BIT STRING wrapping the point; see rfc5280 section 4.2.1.7 and rfc3279 section 2.3.5. 
Similarly the default encoding for PrivateKey is ""PKCS#8"" (unencrypted) which is a structure containing an AlgorithmIdentifier plus an OCTET STRING wrapping the data which in this case contains both the private key value and a copy of the public key, see rfc5208 section 5 and C.4 of document SEC 1 at http://www.secg.org with tag [0] omitted but tag [1] present.
To read (either or both of) them back in to Java, get a KeyFactory.getInstance(""EC"") and use generate{Public,Private} on an X509EncodedKeySpec or PKCS8EncodedKeySpec respectively.
ECDSA and ECDH (and ECMQV etc) use the same key structures, unlike classic integer DSA and DH which use the same mathematical structure ($Z_p^*$) but slightly different representations.
PS: the javadoc for java.security.Key tells you most of this.

The site ECDSA sample give me ""Invalid ECDSA signature message"", and them seems really very different from that smaller Private Key and always starting with ""04"" Public Key generated in the same site.
Also, my backend verification gives me the error ""Invalid point encoding 0x30""
The backend Java method check is:
public ECPublicKey getPublicKeyFromHex(String publicKeyHex)
        throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, DecoderException, ApplicationGenericException {
    byte[] rawPublicKey = Hex.decodeHex(publicKeyHex.toCharArray());
    ECPublicKey ecPublicKey = null;

    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new ApplicationGenericException(e.getMessage(), e.getCause());
    }

    return ecPublicKey;
}

","More practical example. Convert generated public key to decoded bytes array or hex string:  
public String getPublicKeyAsHex(PublicKey publicKey){

    ECPublicKey ecPublicKey = (ECPublicKey)publicKey;
    ECPoint ecPoint = ecPublicKey.getW();

    byte[] publicKeyBytes = new byte[PUBLIC_KEY_LENGTH];
    writeToStream(publicKeyBytes, 0, ecPoint.getAffineX(), PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH);
    writeToStream(publicKeyBytes, PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH, ecPoint.getAffineY(), PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH);

    String hex = Hex.toHexString(publicKeyBytes);

    logger.debug(""Public key bytes: "" + Arrays.toString(publicKeyBytes));
    logger.debug(""Public key hex: "" + hex);

    return hex;
}

private void writeToStream(byte[] stream, int start, BigInteger value, int size) {
    byte[] data = value.toByteArray();
    int length = Math.min(size, data.length);
    int writeStart = start + size - length;
    int readStart = data.length - length;
    System.arraycopy(data, readStart, stream, writeStart, length);
}

Convert decoded bytes array back to PublicKey:
KeyFactory factory = KeyFactory.getInstance(ALGORITHM, ALGORITHM_PROVIDER);

ECNamedCurveParameterSpec spec = ECNamedCurveTable.getParameterSpec(CURVE);

ECNamedCurveSpec params = new ECNamedCurveSpec(CURVE, spec.getCurve(), spec.getG(), spec.getN());

BigInteger xCoordinate = new BigInteger(1, Arrays.copyOfRange(decodedPublicKey, 0, PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH));
BigInteger yCoordinate = new BigInteger(1, Arrays.copyOfRange(decodedPublicKey, PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH, PUBLIC_KEY_LENGTH));
java.security.spec.ECPoint w = new java.security.spec.ECPoint(xCoordinate, yCoordinate);

PublicKey encodedPublicKey = factory.generatePublic(new java.security.spec.ECPublicKeySpec(w, params));

"5186793","Fileformat for EC public/private keys?","If I wanted to store both a private and a public key in a single file, what would be the easiest format to use? Especially if I'm planning to use the BouncyCastle library for Java?
","On a theoretical point of view, the public key can be recomputed from the private key (computational cost for that is slightly lower than the cost for producing a single ECDSA signature, or doing half of ECDH, so it is fast). Therefore, conceptually, you only have to store the private key, and the standard format for that is PKCS#8, which is supported by Java with java.security.spec.PKCS8EncodedKeySpec. Moreover, the PKCS#8 format includes provisions for optionally encoding the public key along the private key in the same blob, so this really looks like what you are looking for.
The tricky thing, however, is to convince the cryptographic provider (e.g. BouncyCastle) to extract the public key as such and/or recompute it. Apparently, if you create a PKCS8EncodedKeySpec from a PKCS#8-encoded EC private key which also contains the public key, BouncyCastle will be kind enough to internally keep a copy of the encoded public key and write it back if you decide to reencode the private key in PKCS#8 format. However, it does nothing else with it; it handles it as an opaque blob.
Hence you must recompute the public key. Wading through the JCE and BouncyCastle API and unimplemented bits, I found the following, which appears to work (JDK 1.6.0_24, BouncyCastle 1.46):
import java.security.KeyFactory;
import java.security.PrivateKey;
import java.security.PublicKey;
import java.security.Provider;
import java.security.spec.PKCS8EncodedKeySpec;
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider;
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JCEECPrivateKey;
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JCEECPublicKey;
import org.bouncycastle.jce.spec.ECParameterSpec;
import org.bouncycastle.jce.spec.ECPublicKeySpec;

// Create the provider and an appropriate key factory.
Provider pp = new BouncyCastleProvider();
KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""EC"", pp);

// Decode the private key (read as a byte[] called 'buf').
PKCS8EncodedKeySpec ks = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(buf);
PrivateKey sk = kf.generatePrivate(ks);

// Recompute public key.
JCEECPrivateKey priv = (JCEECPrivateKey)sk;
ECParameterSpec params = priv.getParameters();
ECPublicKeySpec pubKS = new ECPublicKeySpec(
    params.getG().multiply(priv.getD()), params);
PublicKey pk = kf.generatePublic(pubKS);

// To reencode the private key.
buf = kf.getKeySpec(sk, PKCS8EncodedKeySpec.class).getEncoded();

Conceptually, I should use kf.getkeySpec() with org.bouncycastle.jce.spec.ECPrivateKeySpec instead of ruthlessly casting the private key to the JCEECPrivateKey class, but the clean method appears not to be implemented yet in BouncyCastle.

","Try this (BouncyCastle v1.47, using JDK 1.7.* but I assume JDK 1.6.* will be fine too):

where rawPrivKey and rawPubKey are arrays of byte type.
I suggest you encrypt the encoded private key with a block cipher (i.e. AES) otherwise the file is subject to be stolen and then you are indefinitely exposed.

Or is it just a specific way of selecting g, a, p and b? How are g,a,p and b selected anyway?
","The basic principle is the same, but the selection of the private key and how the public key are computed are significantly different. In addition, everyone has to agree beforehand on the elliptic curve to use.
As noted, in the elliptic-curve version of Diffie-Hellman, you first decide which elliptic curve you're using. That determines a number of independent parameters called the domain parameters. Without getting too technical, it turns out that some curves are better than others for cryptographic purposes, so the parameters are actually chosen carefully rather than at random. This is somewhat analogous to picking good prime factors.
There are two sets of domain parameters:

E, the elliptic curve itself.
G, a point on E that is called the base point.

E and G are necessary and sufficient to describe all the information you need.
In ECC-DH, the private key d is computed by taking a randomly selected number on the interval [1, n-1], where n is the order of G. The public key Q is computed by taking Q = dG. After that the general idea is the same, except that instead of trying to solve a hard integer factorization problem, you're trying to solve a hard discrete logarithm problem.

Any ideas how why it's being rejected and how can I fix this.
","Hey Alex i think this is the solution to your issue. Catching exceptions from a synchronized block fails at run time with the following exception:Rejecting class fr.inra.arttest.MyClass because it failed compile-time verification. So check around any calls to synchronized. Also you can read more about the issue from this google bug post. https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=80961.
Hope it helps !

Any ideas how why it's being rejected and how can I fix this.
","This exception is thrown because of too many variable in single method. Just dividing it to two method fixes the issue. Here is the fix:
package org.whispersystems.curve25519.java;

public class fe_mul {

//CONVERT #include ""fe.h""
//CONVERT #include ""long.h""

/*
h = f * g
Can overlap h with f or g.

/*
Notes on implementation strategy:

Using schoolbook multiplication.
Karatsuba would save a little in some cost models.

Most multiplications by 2 and 19 are 32-bit precomputations;
cheaper than 64-bit postcomputations.

There is one remaining multiplication by 19 in the carry chain;
one *19 precomputation can be merged into this,
but the resulting data flow is considerably less clean.

There are 12 carries below.
10 of them are 2-way parallelizable and vectorizable.
Can get away with 11 carries, but then data flow is much deeper.

With tighter constraints on inputs can squeeze carries into int32.

","I've never encountered this problem but here are a few things you can try. 

make sure you have the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files installed and configured (download here at the bottom of the page)
try using the latest release of BouncyCastle and installing it as a provider in the runtime and not on-the-fly within the program

"27773086","How to decrypt HTTPS (ECDHE) data?","I am trying to understand how exactly HTTPS works and doing a little practical tests.
I have a data captured from HTTPS communication encrypted by TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA.
If I understood it right, client during the TLS handshake creates a master key, which is then encrypted using server's public key and sent to server. This master key (as a plain text) is then used as a symmetric key for encrypting ongoing communication. Is this correct?
If yes, how to decrypt the data, if I know the master key?
It sounded pretty easy to me at first, so I just wrote this script
$masterKey = '8ef36f0eb2c10ea6142693374f6c5c7ae65eee5f6bd45bd1990b08e6c144227382726496b795d62284bd8c6c0cadbbdb';

$sDecrypted = mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, pack('H*', $masterKey), pack('H*', $someRandomEncryptedData), MCRYPT_MODE_CBC);

echo $sDecrypted;

Then I notice that master key is 96 byte long (48 as binary string), which results to PHP warning as the key should be 256 bit (32 byte) long. Am I missing something?

client during the request creates a master key, which is then encrypted using server's public key and sent to server. This master key (as a plain text) is then used as a symmetric key for encrypting ongoing communication. Is this correct?

Well, all-in-all, No.
Because you are asking about DH and ECDH, which are Key Agreement protocols: the client does not generate a random key, encrypt it under the server's public key and then send it to the server. That's Key Transport (like RSA Key Transport), and not DH or ECDH. Key transport is going away in TLS 1.3.
There are two phases to TLS: key agreement and bulk transfer. The phases are not as well defined as in IPSec. When the client and server use DH or ECDH, they arrive at a premaster_secret. That's the shared secret drops out of Diffie-Hellman or Elliptic Curve  Diffie-Hellman.
They take the premaster_secret, they add a client random, a server random, and arrive at a master_secret. Then they take the master_secret and derive 6 symmetric keys from it:

Client initial IV
Client encryption key
Client mac key
Server initial IV
Server encryption key
Server mac key

Those keys are used to key a block or stream cipher.
If you notice, each side contributes to the premaster_secret - the client contributes g^a and the server contributes g^b. Then each side contributes to the master_secret through nonces - the client random and the server random.
The reason there's two contributions from both sides is transport schemes, like RSA Key Transport, don't allow the server to contribute to the premaster_secret. The server has to wait until the derivation of the master_secret to contribute to the key material via a nonce.
So the progression is premaster_secret to master_secret to 6 session keys. I'm not sure where the master key is...


If yes, how to decrypt the data, if I know the master key?

I think its usually easier to just plug it into Wireshark if you have the master key. The Wireshark wiki talks about a master key (though I don't know what it is - there's a premaster_secret and master_secret). See the Wireshark wiki for Secure Socket Layer (SSL).


It sounded pretty easy to me at first, so I just wrote this script

Yeah... :) Check out RFC 5246. That's Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2. Then let's talk about easy :)


Then I notice that master key is 96 byte long (48 as binary string)

96 bytes is the output of the PseudoRandom Function (PRF). Check out RFC 5246, page 13.

signature.sign();

The algorithm identifier is id-ecPublicKey, which is also used for ECDSA keys, so the algorithm selection is not unique here and probably the BC devs have chosen ECDSA as the most suitable choice. You could do something similar like JcaPEMKeyConverter with you own KeyFactory but choose your correct algorithm for EC keys.

","You are a bit short on information there...
There are several signature schemes which use elliptic curves, but the most widespread (by far) is ECDSA. You must then worry about the following points:

Signature operates on a sequence of bits. Every single data bit must be correct. Here, you have ""values"" so there must be an encoding of those values into a sequence of bits (or bytes). To verify the signature, you must use the same encoding than the one used to generate the signature.
ECDSA begins by hashing the input data with a cryptographic hash function. There again, you must use the same one than what was used for generating the signature. As a wild guess, I would say that the hash function is probably SHA-1.
ECDSA operates in an elliptic curve. The curve size is not enough to define the curve: there are many 192-bit curves. However, since defining your own curve is hard, most people use one curve among the 15 curves defined in FIPS 186-3. One of those 15 curves has a ""192-bit size"" (it is called ""P-192"") so chances are that the signature uses that curve.
An ECDSA public key is the encoding of a curve point. A curve point is, nominally, a pair of integers (X, Y) (these are the ""coordinates"" of the point). These integers are from the base field in which the curve lives; for the P-192 curve, the coordinates are 192-bit integers. The ""normal"" encoding for such a public key is then a 49-byte string: the first byte will be 0x02, followed by the big-endian unsigned encoding of X (24 bytes), then the unsigned encoding of Y (24 bytes). Other encodings are possible.
An ECDSA signature formally consists in two integer values, usually called r and s (192-bit integers too). There again, the signature you have is probably a sequence of bytes which is an encoding of the two integers. There are two common encodings, one being a raw big-endian unsigned encoding of both value (hence a 48-byte signature), the other using ASN.1 (for a signature of length 53 or 54  bytes, or so).

Using Bouncy Castle, as @Ashkan suggests, is a good idea. But, as you see, there are quite a lot of assumptions to do about your situation. If you want to gain a thorough understanding of what is going on, buy a copy of ANSI X9.62:2005 (the ECDSA standard). Be warned that the mathematical contents are quite heavy.

"15430784","ECDH Shared secret derived from OpenSSL and BouncyCastle are not always the same although constants and domain parameters are the same for both","I'm trying to implement AES cryptography between an iOS app and a java servlet. Java servlet uses BouncyCastle library while iOS app uses OpenSSL. Although I've used same public/private key pair and domain parameters for both side, shared secret generated by OpenSSL sometimes differs from what generates by BouncyCastle on server - side.
The procedure is as follows;

a public/private key pair generated in server with specified domain
parameters (say server_public_key, server_private_key)
server_public_key is embedded in iOS app in form of an EC_POINT X
and Y
at run-time iOS app generates its own public/private key pair (say
client_key_curve which is an EC_KEY), and
then loads server_public_key and calculates shared secret
(key_agreement) based on server_public_key and client_key_curve, and
then client_public_key (extracted from client_key_curve) as well as
a ciphered message which is encrypted symmetrically using the
derived shared secret (key_agreement) are sent to server
in server - side, shared secret again is calculated using
client_public_key and server ECDH parameters which are the same as
client side, and
then ciphered message decrypted using computed key_agreement

BUT the decrypted messages are not always the same as the client sent messages.
Since I've also developed an Android app which uses the same procedure but employs BouncyCastle for cryptography therefore I suspect the correctness of implemented code using OpenSSL, so the code is revealed here for others to help resolving the issue.

The same curve (named prime256v1 or secp256r1) is used on both side but the results are not always the same.
EDIT 1:
In response to @PeterDettman, I’ve published server – side code for more clarification
public byte[] generateAESSymmetricKey(byte[] client_public_key_hex) throws InvalidRequest{
    try {
        // ECDH Private Key as well as other prime256v1 params was generated by Java ""keytool"" and stored in a JKS file
        KeyStore keyStore = ...;
        PrivateKey privateKey = (PrivateKey) keyStore.getKey(""keyAlias"", ""keyStorePassword"".toCharArray());
        ECPrivateKeyParameters ecdhPrivateKeyParameters = (ECPrivateKeyParameters) (PrivateKeyFactory.createKey(privateKey.getEncoded()));

        ECCurve ecCurve = ecdhPrivateKeyParameters.getParameters().getCurve();
        ECDomainParameters ecDomainParameters = ecdhPrivateKeyParameters.getParameters();
        ECPublicKeyParameters client_public_key = new ECPublicKeyParameters(ecCurve.decodePoint(client_public_key_hex), ecDomainParameters);

        BasicAgreement agree = new ECDHBasicAgreement();
        agree.init(ecdhPrivateKeyParameters);
        byte[] keyAgreement = agree.calculateAgreement(client_public_key).toByteArray();

        SHA1Digest sha1Digest = new SHA1Digest();
        sha1Digest.update(keyAgreement, 0, keyAgreement.length);
        byte hashKeyAgreement[] = new byte[sha1Digest.getDigestSize()];
        sha1Digest.doFinal(hashKeyAgreement, 0);

        byte[] server_calculatd_symmetric_key = new byte[16];
        System.arraycopy(hashKeyAgreement, 0, server_calculatd_symmetric_key, 0, server_calculatd_symmetric_key.length);
        return server_calculatd_symmetric_key;
    } catch (Throwable ignored) {
        return null;
    }
}

where client_public_key_hex is client_public_key that is converted to an array of byte. The expected result is that server_calculatd_symmetric_key equals symmetricKey for all the time. BUT they are not always the same.
EDIT 2:
As a feedback to @PeterDettman answer, I made some changes to reflect his suggestion and although rate of inequality reduces, generated key agreements (shared secret) on either side are not still equal in all cases.
It is possible to reproduce one of inequality case with following data

Public key :

So is there any mistake in the implemented code or procedure?

","There's a problem in the server code, in the way that the ECDH agreement value is converted to bytes:
byte[] keyAgreement = agree.calculateAgreement(client_public_key).toByteArray();

Try this instead:
BigInteger agreementValue = agree.calculateAgreement(client_public_key);
byte[] keyAgreement = BigIntegers.asUnsignedByteArray(agree.getFieldSize(), agreementValue);

This will ensure a fixed-size byte array as output, which is a requirement for converting EC field elements to octet strings (search ""Field Element to Octet String Conversion Primitive"" for more details).
I recommend you ignore the SHA1 key derivation part until you can get that Java keyAgreement byte array to exactly match the input to your KDF1_SHA1 function.

Since the ECPublicKeyParameters object only has one method getQ() I am assuming thats all that is required to reconstruct the key. The other parameters such as the curve used (P-521) are kept constant.

Unless there is another way to get the raw bytes of the public key pubKey, I don't see a way to get the bytes without invoking method getQ() which returns an ECPoint object.
My question is how to reconstruct the byte[] into a ECPoint object using bouncy castle's lightweight API. Or, better yet, how to reconstruct the whole ECPublicKeyParameter object using an byte array somehow derived from the original pubKey object.
","To whomever it may concern I resolved this issue by using the PublicKeyFactory and SubjectPublicKeyInfoFactory to encode and decode the key.

I was able to get the raw bytes of the key.
and using:

","An elliptic curve point is not an integer. Putting the encoded representation of a point (G) in a BigInteger and trying to use it as an integer is nowhere near correct. Elliptic curve point multiplication is not integer multiplication, and is nowhere near as simple as BigInteger.multiply. And it is written with the scalar on the left, e.g. kG not Gk.
Translating the standard (or at least conventional) algorithms given at the bitcoin Q to Java really should be a reasonably simple exercise for any Java programmer. 
Scalar Multiplication of Point over elliptic Curve contains (in the answer) a correct implementation for P192 aka secp192r1; it can be converted to secp256k1 by replacing p and a with the values from the spec (SEC2 from https://www.secg.org or X9.62 if you have it) or any existing implementation -- including Java (see below) -- and discarding the P192-specific test data. Actually you mostly need to change p; the Koblitz curves were chosen to have a=0. Elliptic Curve Multiplication Function contains a not-quite-correct implementation that is stated to be for secp256k1 but doesn't actually include the constants for any curve.

since java 7, there are classes included in the java.security.* and java.security.spec.* packages to do this in short code

Not really. First, Java crypto isolates the classes you see in java.security and javax.crypto from the implementation code, which is in entirely different classes (mostly (still) under sun.* and com.sun.*) in one or more 'providers' which are separate jars and technically optional; it is possible to remove, add, or change providers without changing the calls in your code, although most people don't. The JCA 'facade' classes for EC crypto were present since java 5 (called 1.5), but no provider implementing EC algorithms was included in the standard build; to use them you had to add a third-party provider. Starting in java 7 a standard SunEC provider IS included. However, JCA (for all algorithms not just EC) keeps private and public keys strictly separate after generation, and in particular it provides no way to access the private-to-public derivation logic that exists internally for EC.
It does include the parameters for several standard curves, including secp256k1, which you could use to avoid the effort of copying them from the spec. There doesn't appear to be a direct way to access this data, but you can do so indirectly by generating a nonce key and discarding it. Alternatively, since you already have a private key you can create the encoding Java uses (PKCS8) and read that in, producing the same curve parameters and also a usable key. In general constructing ASN.1 DER encodings like PKCS8 is fairly complicated, but for EC it is simplified because (1) everybody uses the 'named' form which encodes the curve as a single OID and (2) the standard specifies an encoding of the private value which is fixed in length for a given curve; as a result the PKCS8 encoding for a given EC curve consists of a fixed prefix followed by the private key value. Example snippets:
    KeyPairGenerator kg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance (""EC"");
    kg.initialize (new ECGenParameterSpec (""secp256k1""));
    ECParameterSpec p = ((ECPublicKey) kg.generateKeyPair().getPublic()).getParams();
    System.out.println (""p=(dec)"" + ((ECFieldFp) p.getCurve().getField()).getP() );
    ECPoint G = p.getGenerator(); 
    System.out.format (""Gx=(hex)%032x%n"", G.getAffineX());
    System.out.format (""Gy=(hex)%032x%n"", G.getAffineY());
    //
    byte[] privatekey_enc = DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary(
            ""303E020100301006072A8648CE3D020106052B8104000A042730250201010420""+

    // note fixed prefix for PKCS8-EC-secp256k1 plus your private value
    KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""EC"");
    PrivateKey k1 = kf.generatePrivate(new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(privatekey_enc));
    ECParameterSpec p2 = ((ECPrivateKey) k1).getParams();
    System.out.println (""again p=(dec)"" + ((ECFieldFp) p2.getCurve().getField()).getP() );

which produces output:

Note those coordinates for the basepoint G match your expectation. I displayed a mix of decimal and hex just to show the possibilities; this does not affect the actual numbers in the computer.
ADDED in response to comments:
The variables p and p2 are ECParameterSpec objects which contain the parameters of an EC curve (underlying field, curve coefficients, basepoint aka generator, order and cofactor; and internally 'name' although the API doesn't expose it). The values I print labelled 'p' are the result of calling getP which returns one item from the curve parameters, namely the modulus of the underlying prime field, and thus the value you need to use in the calculations shown in the linked post where it does mod(p) and modInverse(p) and modPow(,p). Since this p (or P) is a parameter of the curve it is the same for all keys on that curve; note the two values I print are the same even though they are from different keys. There are actually two kinds of elliptic curves standardized for cryptography: curves over a prime field, denoted Fp, and curves over an extension field of characteristic two, denoted F2m. secp256k1 is the first kind, that's why the cast to ECFieldFp before calling getP(). 
Yes my fixed prefix contains the headers and fields identifying a privatekey (PKCS8) encoding as being for EC and secp256k1 and that prefix is the same for all EC secp256k1 privatekeys. The p values are as described above, and not privatekeys or publickeys. Yes if you had the public point you could combine it with the ECParameterSpec into an ECPublicKeySpec and convert it and use it -- or you could append the point encoding to a similar but different fixed prefix to get an X509EncodedKeySpec which is the encoding Java uses for publickeys and convert that without needing the ECParameterSpec in advance -- but your whole problem, as I understand it, is that you don't have the public point yet and want to derive it, which requires the point multiplication calculation shown in the linked posts.

According to BouncyCastle's release notes, this has been supported since 1.32 (I'm using 1.46), but I keep getting an exception stating that no cipher can be found for the ECDSA OID.

org.bouncycastle.cms.CMSException: exception wrapping content key:
  cannot create cipher: Cannot find any provider supporting
  1.2.840.10045.2.1

Here is a snippet from one of the test certificates I am using
  Version: V3
  Subject: EMAILADDRESS=bob@example.com
  Signature Algorithm: SHA256withECDSA, OID = 1.2.840.10045.4.3.2

  Key:  EC Public Key

The code I am using to create the encrypted message looks like this:
// allow the use of the BC JCE
Security.addProvider(new org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider());

SMIMEEnvelopedGenerator gen = new SMIMEEnvelopedGenerator();
JceKeyTransRecipientInfoGenerator rig = new JceKeyTransRecipientInfoGenerator(cert);
gen.addRecipientInfoGenerator(rig);

MimeBodyPart msg = new MimeBodyPart();
msg.setText(message);

MimeBodyPart mp = gen.generate(
    msg,
    new JceCMSContentEncryptorBuilder(
        CMSAlgorithm.AES128_CBC).setProvider(""BC"").build());

Properties props = System.getProperties();
Session session = Session.getDefaultInstance(props, null);

// TODO: This is incorrect.  Perhaps AKA is better?
String to = cert.getSubjectDN().getName();

Address fromUser = new InternetAddress(from);
Address toUser = new InternetAddress(to);

MimeMessage body = new MimeMessage(session);
body.setFrom(fromUser);
body.setRecipient(Message.RecipientType.TO, toUser);
body.setSubject(""example encrypted message"");
body.setContent(mp.getContent(), mp.getContentType());
body.saveChanges();

body.writeTo(new FileOutputStream(filename));

I'm sure I'm doing something obviously wrong, but I'm not seeing it right now.  Any ideas?
","As Thomas Pornin suggested (above), ECDH needed to be used to make this work.  So instead of using a JceKeyTransRecipientInfoGenerator, it was necessary to use a JceKeyAgreeRecipientInfoGenerator.
SMIMEEnvelopedGenerator gen = new SMIMEEnvelopedGenerator();
JceKeyAgreeRecipientInfoGenerator rig = new JceKeyAgreeRecipientInfoGenerator(CMSAlgorithm.ECDH_SHA1KDF, senderPrivateKey, senderPublicKey, CMSAlgorithm.AES128_WRAP);
rig.setProvider(""BC"");
gen.addRecipientInfoGenerator(rig);

"22293864","Ruby/openssl: convert Elliptic Curve point octet string into OpenSSL::PKey::EC::Point","I am trying to write Ruby code to check the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signature on a particular message that I found here.
The problem is that I don't know how to convert the octet string for the public key into an OpenSSL::PKey::EC::Point object.  If I were writing this in C, I would just pass the octet string to OpenSSL's o2i_ECPublicKey, which does something close to what I would want and in fact is used by the reference implementation.  However, I searched the source code of Ruby (MRI) and it contains no calls to o2i_ECPublicKey so I don't know how I would use that function from Ruby without writing a C extension.
Here is the octet string, in hex.  It is just a 0x04 byte followed by two 32-byte integers that represent the x and y coordinates of the point on the elliptic curve:
04fc9702847840aaf195de8442ebecedf5b095cdbb9bc716bda9110971b28a49e0ead8564ff0db22209e0374782c093bb899692d524e9d6a6956e7c5ecbcd68284

key = OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new('secp256k1')
key.public_key = point
result = key.dsa_verify_asn1(digest, signature)

I think it's weird that OpenSSL makes you represent the public key temporarily as a single BN (big number), because it is actually two big numbers.  My gem can directly convert octet strings (as defined in the SEC2 standard) into ECDSA::Point objects.
","OpenSSL allows you to create a point with a group and a bignum, so I tried this:
require 'openssl'
include OpenSSL
group = PKey::EC::Group.new('secp256k1')
bignum = BN.new('04fc9702847840...')
point = PKey::EC::Point.new(group, bignum)

But it raises OpenSSL::PKey::EC::Point::Error: invalid encoding.  I'm not quite sure how to troubleshoot it from here, but hopefully this helps you out a little bit.

","For any given alias only one of key and cert will be non-null. In this case evidently cert was non-null and key was null. If there is an EC private key in your keystore you will need to work a little harder to find it. You can determine what kind of entry is at the alias by testing with isCertificateEntry and isKeyEntry.

The error message is unfortunately confusing because it is actually coming from the bouncycastle library. The class referred to in ECDH key agreement requires ECPrivateKey is not java.security.interfaces.ECPrivateKey but rather org.bouncycastle.jce.interfaces.ECPrivateKey

"19911025","SVG path with rounded corners as arcs of a circle","I need to create SVG paths with rounded corners to export them to DXF for cutting. My problem is that the corners should be arcs of a circle, not some bezier curve.
Its relatively easy with right angles using the arc command because the radius is also the distance from the corner to where the arc begins. With other angles it is way more complicated.
Is there a formula to calculate the start and end point of the arc given a corner and a radius?

The upper right corner is easy but the lower left is very tricky because I have to find out where the line has to end and the arc begins.
I've found calculationg with a svg eliptical arc, which links a formula to convert end-point to center parametrization. Which doesn't help because I also don't know where the center of the circle has to be.
How to calculate the SVG Path for an arc (of a circle) just calculates the arc, not an arc between two lines replacing a sharp corner.
The solutions in Rounded corners on triangle in SVG work only when some sides are parallel to the coordinate system or change the radius.
Applying rounded corners to paths/polygons tries to use some tricks with linejoin or several cubic curves, nothing I want.
Even Inkscape (which I used to draw the image above) uses 5 cubic curves instead of an arc even when I used a circle to create this shape.
If you have some hints how I can manage this I would be very grateful.
","The geometry of a chamfered corner looks like this:

Angle ABC is equal to θ (the outside angle of the chamfered corner). This is bisected by BD, so angle DBC is equal to θ/2. That means the offset distance d from the corner to points C and A is equal to r × tan(θ/2).
For a right angle, θ=90° and tan(θ/2)=1, so d is equal to r.
As Robert Longson said, you would be lucky to find an SVG application that exports chamfered corners using circular arc segments. However, with a bit of effort, it should be possible to detect and convert them programmatically.

The axis() is there because I was also trying to get a clearer-looking chart with grid lines, and I thought that grid() would also take care of that but apparently not. I was also going to try to make it interactive where you click on the points you want and it calculates, but looking over the docs there seems like a lot of interaction mouse options but I don't see mouse interaction that creates some event by clicking on a point on the chart (after the 3rd time reading it over I'm still missing it). 
I'm just going from the pyplot summary on matplotlib but I'm not seeing what I'm doing wrong here.  The plot of the elliptic curve is way off, not even close.  
This is probably a beginner mistake so a junior programmer who takes a second to read this will probably see very quickly why I'm not getting the curve I want.

","You're probably in the wrong area of the BouncyCastle class hierarchy for what you want to do.  (I stumbled around in the same place, for probably the same reasons.)  If you're looking to implement ECDH that must be interoperable, you're definitely in the wrong place.
Why is it structured so unintuitively?  Well, the reason is that the abstractions in BouncyCastle are where they focus their attention and provide their value.  Instead of gearing for people saying ""I'm going to use ECDH key-encrypting keys"" and wanting to deal with low-level crypto details, BC expects you to use manager-level abstractions like ""public key"", ""private key"", and ""certificate"", and fill in the security parameters like ""kind"" and ""bitstrength"" in the middle of it.

BouncyCastle will quite happily waste time and electricity recalculating the public key every time you load this, unless you take care to save _keypair.Public in something like a self-signed X509Certificate.
var _cgen = new X509V3CertificateGenerator();
_cgen.Reset();
_cgen.SetNotBefore(DateTime.Now);
_cgen.SetNotAfter(new DateTime(2999, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59, DateTimeKind.Utc));

}

    .ReadCertificate(certStream);
var publicKey = certificate.GetPublicKey();
reconstitutedPair = new AsymmetricKeyPair(publicKey,privateKey);

Now, that all said, here's the answer your actual question.
.NET 4 provides a byte[] because it's calling OLE platform-native code which does all of the abstraction for you.  It's the most efficient representation for this purpose, because it doesn't parse what it gets back from CNG, performing the least amount of object boxing back into the CLR object space and relying on the programmer to deal with what's essentially an opaque blob.  
BouncyCastle uses its BigInteger class because it's how it implements bignum calculations with 64-bit longs.  It is the most efficient representation for this purpose, because the overhead of processing 8-bit byte by 8-bit byte is far more than 8 times the cost of processing 64-bit long by 64-bit long.  Either way, it requires iteratively calling BitConverter on a different section of the input byte[].  Those iterations and method calls add up, so BigInteger is the ""internal representation of a number"".
These are not even remotely comparable uses, so this is probably not what you want to do.
If you want to get a byte[] from BigInteger, use its ToByteArray() method.  If you want to transform a byte[] to a BigInteger, construct a new BigInteger object with the byte[] containing the bit string you want to calculate with.  new BigInteger(oldBigInteger.ToByteArray()) works as you'd expect (a new BigInteger object which has the same value as the old one).  Directly working with them is usually inappropriate, because EC public keys are made up of two numbers.  Also, ToByteArray() only dumps the value of the integer, it doesn't include any DER encoding information to identify it as an integer of whatever length.
(Also, in C#, 'byte' and 'char' are different things with different sizes.  'byte' is 8 bits long.  'char' is a Unicode code point, and those are potentially larger than 8 bits.  'char' (along with 'string', which is conceptually a sequence of chars) requires encoding/decoding before it'll fit into byte-sized pieces.)

Thanks.
","Let's start from the last sentence of the question:

All I am looking for is to use a ""Private key"" to encrypt firmware and the bootloader uses ""Public Key"" to decrypt it.

There's some confusion in terminology here. Private keys are used to decrypt (or sign) and public keys are used to encrypt (or verify). If I understand correctly, what you want is for the bootloader to verify a signature on the firmware so that only a firmware that was properly signed by yourself will be accepted by the bootloader.
There are various asymmetric signature schemes which can be used for this purpose, including some which are based on eliptic curve cryptography. For example you could use the OpenSSL implementation of ECDSA (see http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/ecdsa.html).
I'm afraid there's not enough information in the question to properly choose the best signature scheme (and possibly an encryption scheme as well if there is a need to keep the firmware secret). In any case, good cryptography is not enough to make a system secure and other considerations such as secure implementation are no less important.
If this is is something that is important for you to protect and that you are worried that hackers may try to break, I would strongly advise procuring the services of a security professional. Using cryptography correctly is a very tricky business that requires a full understanding of the system - otherwise you may find yourself in a situation like this

","If you look for ""authentication"" you have to use asymmetric algorithm like EC, this usually done because if the user or process want to update the ""firmware"" he should identify him self to the bootloader  by his ""signature"" to check who request this update.
After that is done, the bootloader will load the symmetric key from a secure memory to decrypt what you want to do.
So, you have a symmetric key for encryption (AES), and asymmetric two keys for authentication (=Who are you?).
Note: there is no advantages of EC on 32 bit CPU executing at 60MHz for Encryption, unless your application need asymmetric for Encryption NOT authentication, this happen due to line between the user and bootloader is not secure.
Therefore, you could use bootloader's ""public key"" to encrypt firmware and the bootloader uses its ""private Key"" to decrypt it, however, the implementation cost a lot due to the high computing for asymmetric algorithm.
Look for ""lightweight cryptography"", it is typical for your application.

How do I convert it to the required type? And also I could not find the secp256r1 curve in OpenSSL, but I used the one in the code after doing some research. Is it correct?
Thanks !
","The peer's public key is a point on the curve. From crypto\ec\ec_lcl.h:
struct ec_key_st {
    int version;

    EC_GROUP *group;

    EC_POINT *pub_key;
    BIGNUM   *priv_key;

    unsigned int enc_flag;
    point_conversion_form_t conv_form;

    int     references;
    int flags;

    EC_EXTRA_DATA *method_data;
} /* EC_KEY */;

I believe you need to call EC_POINT_new (c_lcl.h is a private header, so you won't have access to the structure).
Luckily, there's a lot of functions to manipulate them. From the EC_POINT_new(3) docs:

EC_POINTs can be converted to and from various external
  representations. Supported representations are octet strings, BIGNUMs
  and hexadecimal. The format of the external representation is
  described by the point_conversion_form. See EC_GROUP_copy(3) for a
  description of point_conversion_form. Octet strings are stored in a
  buffer along with an associated buffer length. A point held in a
  BIGNUM is calculated by converting the point to an octet string and
  then converting that octet string into a BIGNUM integer. Points in
  hexadecimal format are stored in a NULL terminated character string
  where each character is one of the printable values 0-9 or A-F (or
  a-f).

Also see EC_POINT_set_affine_coordinates_GFp, EC_POINT_set_affine_coordinates_GF2m and EC_KEY_set_public_key:
$ grep -R EC_KEY_set_public_key *
crypto/ec/ec.h:int EC_KEY_set_public_key(EC_KEY *key, const EC_POINT *pub);
...

You can see an example of how to set the point on the OpenSSL wiki at Elliptic Curve Cryptography.

I have been successful in creating the necessary AsymmetricCipherKeyPair objects and I'm also able to generate the shared key of the other partys public key.
However, to actually exchange the public key, I need it as a byte[] or at least anything I can turn into raw data, since the protocol I'm using to transport the keys between the parties wont take any BouncyCastle object.
   X9ECParameters ecPars = NistNamedCurves.GetByName(""P-521"");
  ECDomainParameters ecDomPars = new ECDomainParameters(ecPars.Curve, ecPars.G, ecPars.N, ecPars.H, ecPars.GetSeed());

  AsymmetricCipherKeyPair keyPair = gen.GenerateKeyPair();
  IBasicAgreement keyAgreement = AgreementUtilities.GetBasicAgreement(""ECDH"");
  keyAgreement.Init(keyPair.Private);

So what I'm needing here is the key value of keyPair.Public as a byte[].
I hope you understand where I'm heading and can help me.
","If you have only an ECPublicKeyParameter 'pub' (i.e. from keyPair.Public), you can get the public point encoding:

At the receiving end:
ECCurve curve = ecDomPars.Curve;
ECPoint q = curve.DecodePoint(data);
ECPublicKeyParameter peerPub = new ECPublicKeyParameter(q, ecDomPars);

It's more typical to exchange certificates, or else you will have no assurance of whom you're ""agreeing"" with.

When I generate the derived secret in Java I always get a different number from what I get from OpenSSL.

Each run of the protocol will produce different results. That's because each party picks a random value for each run of the protocol. That is, the a in g^a is random and different for each run, so the public key A = g^a is different for each run. 
If everything is working correctly, you'll never see the parties use the same values, or one party to reuse a past value. Independent executions will never produce the same result. It does not matter if its OpenSSL ↔ OpenSSL, OpenSSL ↔ Java, or Java ↔ Java. They will always produce different results.

Regardless of efficiency, I do want such a solution, so that if anyone wants to send me a message, my EC public key is published and the sender has to:

get his/her own EC private key 
combine this private key with my public one and calculate a shared secret 
use the secret and AES or other symmetric cipher encrypt the message 
send me ciphertext and the derived public key(from this private key).

But here is a problem. I observed that a successful key exchange exists only when either side generate their keys basing on the same curve parameters. But unless I provide additional information of what curve my public key has based on, is there any other way of figuring this out? A public key is loaded with:
M2Crypto.EC.load_pub_key([filename])

And an EC.EC_pub instance is returned. I think information about the curve should hide somewhere in this instance, but I've not found where.
Please point out what I have missed, or if my solution was wrong or can be simpler, or any other suggestions. Thanks.

Now, here was my approach to try solving this issue at hand. This remote server requires client authentication and that certificate is the one that uses elliptic curves (using a client certificate with different public key algorithms and signature algorithms does not cause the error meaning that the client certificate is at fault here).

openssl x509 -in <client_cert> -text -noout

The client certificate is as follows:

"6648166","Elliptic Curve Encryption","Please provide me an example using the Bouncycastle library showing how to add two points on an elliptic curve.
I tried the following code but i didn't get the same result that should happen theoretically.
   X9ECParameters x9=NISTNamedCurves.getByName(""P-224"");
   ECCurve curve=x9.getCurve();
   ECFieldElement x1=new ECFieldElement.Fp(new BigInteger(""10""), new BigInteger(""8""));

   ECFieldElement y2=new ECFieldElement.Fp(new BigInteger(""10""), new BigInteger(""6""));
   ECPoint.Fp p2=new ECPoint.Fp(curve, x2, y2);
   p2=(ECPoint.Fp) p1.add(p2);
   System.out.println(p2.getX().toBigInteger()+"" ""+p2.getY().toBigInteger());

And also I didn't understand what value is to provide for first BigInteger in ECFiledElement.
","Your example makes no sense at all so it is hard to understand what you think the result should be. By using low-level classes like ECFieldElement you are taking full responsibility to provide sensible parameters. You have selected NIST curve P-224. This elliptic curve is defined over a specific field. You can retrieve the prime 'q' for this finite field and use it to create field elements by the following (departing from your example):
    X9ECParameters x9 = NISTNamedCurves.getByName(""P-224"");
    ECCurve.Fp curve = (Fp) x9.getCurve();
    BigInteger q = curve.getQ();
    ECFieldElement x1 = new ECFieldElement.Fp(q, new BigInteger(""8""));
    ECFieldElement y1 = new ECFieldElement.Fp(q, new BigInteger(""9""));

The first argument of the ECFieldElement.Fp constructor is the prime that defines the field.
The second problem with your example is that not every pair (x,y) of integers is a point on the elliptic curve. The chance of a random (x,y) being on P-224 is incredibly small. Here again, by messing with the low-level EPoint classes Bouncycastle does not check this for you. So while you can make the machinery of the elliptic curve addition software run and give you answers, those answers are meaningless.
To make any more progress I have to ask first: what are you trying to do? 
EDIT: 
There are two basic ways to find a point on an elliptic curve.

take an existing known point on the curve and scalar multiply by an integer. The result is another point on the curve.
Pick an x-coordinate, say x1. Plug it into the right side of the elliptic curve formula to y1^2 = E(x1). Then attempt to compute a square root in the field. If the square root exists, then you get two points (x1, y1) and (x1,-y1) that are on the curve. If the square root does not exists, then there is no point on the curve with x-coordinate x1.

You can get a point on your elliptic curve by ECPoint.Fp = (ECPoint.Fp)x9.getG(); You can multiply that point by an integer with the ECPoint.multiply(...).
Using method #2 is harder than it needs to be with Bouncycastle. All the methods are in the ECPoint and ECFieldElement classes. The ECFieldElement class contains a public square root method that you can use to attempt to compute the square root. If it returns null then the square root does not exist.

","ECIES is not present in the normal Java libraries, at least not up to the current date. You have to use a library like Bouncy Castle.
For quality of the curves you could take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to (if you have the stomach for it). Each set of domain parameters is always directly tied to the key size. I like Brainpool curves myself; they are relatively standard and relatively safe if you use them with some care.
Note: never directly encrypt plaintext with RSA, DSA or ECIES, always try and use hybrid cryptography. So compare with input sizes of 128, 192 or 256 bits at most.

","ECDH is not an encryption algorithm; it cannot encrypt some data you choose. It is a key agreement protocol, which results in a ""shared secret"": the data which both sender and receiver end up sharing is ""secret"" (only them know it) but they cannot control its contents.
The idea is that you can use the shared secret as the basis for a symmetric encryption algorithm. Since the shared secret has a relatively non-flexible format (with ECDH, the shared secret is an elliptic curve point, and about half of it is really secret), the normal way is to hash it with a secure hash function (say, SHA-256) and use the hash output (or part of it) as the actual encryption key.

"50275351","Converting EC PublicKey Hex String to PublicKey","While performing Elliptic Curve cryptography with secp256k1 curve, I noticed that while the code and test cases compile on the Android Studio IDE they do not compile on the android device since the curve isn't defined in the jre/jdk that the mobile device uses. Changing the curve to a prime256v1 I seem to be facing difficulties in converting a hex string of the publicKey to PublicKey object.
Given the hex string of a PublicKey.getEncoded() which is in a database. I want an android client to convert the byte[] from converting the hex string into a PublicKey object. I am converting the byte[] using X509EncodedKeySpec() as follows:
public static PublicKey getPublicKey(byte[] pk) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException {
    EncodedKeySpec publicKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(pk);
    KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""EC"");
    PublicKey pub = kf.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);
    return pub;
}

The conversion from a hex string to a byte[] happens as follows:
public static byte[] hexStringToByteArray(String hexString) {
    byte[] bytes = new byte[hexString.length() / 2];

    for(int i = 0; i < hexString.length(); i += 2){
        String sub = hexString.substring(i, i + 2);
        Integer intVal = Integer.parseInt(sub, 16);
        bytes[i / 2] = intVal.byteValue();
        String hex = """".format(""0x%x"", bytes[i / 2]);
    }
    return bytes;
}

The conversion from a byte[] to Hex string is as follows:
public static String convertBytesToHex(byte[] bytes) {
    char[] hexChars = new char[bytes.length * 2];
    for ( int j = 0; j < bytes.length; j++ ) {
        int v = bytes[j] & 0xFF;
        hexChars[j * 2] = hexArray[v >>> 4];
        hexChars[j * 2 + 1] = hexArray[v & 0x0F];
    }
    return new String(hexChars).toLowerCase();
}

However when I run this on the android app (7.0, API 24) I get the following System Error
W/System.err: java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException: java.lang.RuntimeException: error:0c0000b9:ASN.1 encoding routines:OPENSSL_internal:WRONG_TAG

What is the recommended approach for converting a Hex string to a PublicKey for EC instance on an android device.
Here's sample code that you can execute:
ECDSA.java
public class ECDSA {

    public static KeyPair generateKeyPair() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidAlgorithmParameterException {
        KeyPairGenerator keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""EC"");
        ECGenParameterSpec ecSpec = new ECGenParameterSpec(""prime256v1"");
        SecureRandom random = SecureRandom.getInstance(""SHA1PRNG"");
        keyGen.initialize(ecSpec, random);
        KeyPair pair = keyGen.generateKeyPair();
        return pair;
    }

    public static PublicKey getPublicKey(byte[] pk) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException {
        EncodedKeySpec publicKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(pk);
        KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""EC"");
        PublicKey pub = kf.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);
        return pub;
    }

    public static PrivateKey getPrivateKey(byte[] privk) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException {
        EncodedKeySpec privateKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(privk);
        KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""EC"");
        PrivateKey privateKey = kf.generatePrivate(privateKeySpec);
        return privateKey;
    }
}

MainActivity.java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    KeyPair keyPair = ECDSA.generateKeyPair();
    PublicKey publicKey = keyPair.getPublic();
    PrivateKey privateKey = keyPair.getPrivate();
    // Converting byte[] to Hex
    publicKeyHex = convertBytesToHex(publicKey.getEncoded());
    privateKeyHex = convertBytesToHex(privateKey.getEncoded());
    // Trying to convert Hex to PublicKey/PrivateKey objects
    PublicKey pkReconstructed = ECDSA.getPublicKey(hexStringToByteArray(publicKeyHex));
    PrivateKey skReconstructed = ECDSA.getPrivateKey(hexStringToByteArray(privateKeyHex));
    // This throws an error when running on an android device
    // because there seems to be some library mismatch with 
    // java.security.* vs conscrypt.OpenSSL.* on android.
}

","Finally we get a real MCVE and we can now see that you are not using the correct class for encoded private keys. X509EncodedKeySpec is only for public keys. From the javadocs (emphasis mine):

This class represents the ASN.1 encoding of a public key, encoded
  according to the ASN.1 type SubjectPublicKeyInfo.

For private keys, the correct encoding is usually a PKCS8EncodedKeySpec. The encoding can be determined by examining the output of Key.getFormat(). Therefore, change your method getPrivateKey of ECDSA to
public static PrivateKey getPrivateKey(byte[] privk) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException {
        EncodedKeySpec privateKeySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(privk);
        KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""EC"");
        PrivateKey privateKey = kf.generatePrivate(privateKeySpec);
        return privateKey;

","If you want to do this with Bezier curves, you'll have to decide how ""wrong"" you want it to look. Bezier curves cannot represent circular (and by extension, elliptical) curves, they can only get really close, in the same way a polygon can, just with higher precision using fewer sections.
I describe both circle-approximation and curve offsetting using Bezier curves in my primer on Bezier curves, http://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/#circles_cubic and http://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/#offsetting respectively, but if you're coding this from scratch particularly the offsetting will be overkill if you only need it for what you describe in your example.
Instead, I'd recommend firing up Inkscape or Illustrator, turning on the grid overlay, and drawing a bezier curve around your ellipse. Make it look good, then check what the coordinates are, and use that as reliable-enough information for implementing in your canvas program. You probably don't need mathematically rigidly correct, as long as people don't go ""that looks wrong"", you should be just fine.

I need the address before I can recreate the wallet because I need to skip some of the addresses and not add them to the new wallet.
I was pointed to a python tool that includes the conversion method: pywallet, but I'd rather do this in Perl, so I can more easily script it. I also found these two JavaScript sites that do this: bitaddress.org and brainwallet.org.
I found the following libraries on CPAN, which sound like they might be helpful to do this, but I have no idea how to plug the pieces together: Math::EllipticCurve::Prime, Crypt::OpenSSL::EC. The documentation for the former says it's really slow, the latter is probably faster because it uses a C library, but the documentation is confusing. I also found some elliptic curve code on Rosetta Code. And there used to be a Crypt::ECDSA on CPAN, but was deleted at some point.

System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException: The requested operation is not supported.

What do I not understand correctly (or on the more sad side, what is not implemented correctly (or at all) in windows/.NET)?
As an alternative, if somebody could explain how to port this Node JS library to .NET that'd work too (I think that's a bit of a reach) 
Update
I needed to keep working through the rest of the problem and not be held up by the encryption, so I used a Node.JS Wrapper to allow for further development on the .NET side. The node code simply generates the local public key and the Shared secret and returns those values to me. I still need to get this working without the Node wrapper.
Because of this test I can confirm that the rest of the code (not included here) works, so the issue definitely lies in the code above (and my inability to generate the derived key material if the HashAlgorithm is specified as CngAlgorithm.ECDiffieHellmanP256
","This solution is only confirmed working on Windows 10 64-bit. It is confirmed not working on Windows 8.1 64 bit, and is untested on other platforms.
The problem is that ECDiffieHellmanP256 is not a hash algorithm, but you are specifying to use a hash key derivation function. Your KeyDerivationFunction should be set to ECDiffieHellmanKeyDerivationFunction.Tls, and you need to specify the seed and label for the KDF.

var keyLength = new byte[] { 0x20, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 };
key1.RemoveAt(0);
key1 = keyType.Concat(keyLength).Concat(key1).ToList();

ECDiffieHellmanCng a = new ECDiffieHellmanCng();
a.KeyDerivationFunction = ECDiffieHellmanKeyDerivationFunction.Tls;

byte[] label = new byte[32];
string labelStr = ""The purpose"";
Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(labelStr, 0, labelStr.Length, label, 0);
a.Label = label;

byte[] seed = new byte[32];
RNGCryptoServiceProvider rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();
rng.GetBytes(seed);
a.Seed = seed;

a.KeySize = 256;

CngKey k = CngKey.Import(key1.ToArray(), CngKeyBlobFormat.EccPublicBlob);
byte[] derivedMaterial = a.DeriveKeyMaterial(k);

Note that I set a nonsense value to the a.Label property.
The NIST SP 800-108 publication defines the label as:

Label – A string that identifies the purpose for the derived keying material, which is encoded as a binary string.

I'm not sure what the purpose should be set to in your specific context. If anyone has a better understanding what this string should be, please leave a comment.
Also note that if you're going to call this function repeatedly, you should probably keep a persistent copy of the RNGCryptoServiceProvider and use that.

Apparently the JKS KeyStore implementation doesn't loop through the list of security providers. This works fine, however, for other KeyStore types that are supported by BC: PKCS12 and BKS. Is there a way to use JKS as KeyStore type while using BC to recover the key?

My problem is that although I store them correctly(without any additional character), when I read the file and try to convert the hex characters to BIGNUM a character '04' or '00' randomly appears (or even sometimes not). So when I try to set the public/private keys and check the whole key, it fails. Could anyone help me with this issue? Could the key checking failure be caused by these characters or they are normal?
Here is my code that generates/stores the private key(the public one is the same):
    EC_KEY *b = NULL;
const BIGNUM *ppriv_b;
FILE *claveprivb;
const EC_GROUP *group;

b = EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name(NID_X9_62_prime192v1);

if ((ppriv_b != NULL)) 
    BN_print_fp(claveprivb,ppriv_b);
    fclose(claveprivb);

    //Afterwards do the same with the public key

And here is my code for retrieving the Private key:

unsigned char *bbuf;
FILE *clavepriv, *clavetotalb;
const char cpriv_string[PRIVATE_KEY_SIZE];
BIGNUM *priv;

    b = EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name(NID_X9_62_prime192v1);
groupb = EC_KEY_get0_group(b);
    //Open the file with the hexadecimals (PRIVATE KEY)
    clavepriv = fopen(""/tmp/mnt/claveprivb"", ""r"");
kk2 = fread(&cpriv_string, sizeof(char), PRIVATE_KEY_SIZE, clavepriv);

priv = BN_new();
    //THIS FUNCTION (HEX2BN) GENERATES THE RANDOM CHARACTER: 
kk2 = BN_hex2bn(&priv, cpriv_string);
ret = EC_KEY_set_private_key(b, priv);

    //HERE I retrieve the public key by the same way and set it into EC_KEY b,
    //the same random character appears in the public key

    if (!EC_KEY_check_key(b)) {
    printf(""EC_KEY_check_key failed\n"");
} else {
    printf(""Key verified OK\n"");
}
    //It fails when try to check it.

int k;
clavetotalb = fopen(""/tmp/mnt/clavetotalb"", ""w+"");
k = EC_KEY_print_fp(clavetotalb, b, 0);

bout = ECDH_compute_key(bbuf, blen, EC_KEY_get0_public_key(b), b,
        KDF1_SHA1);

Any advise would be very appreciated!!!!Thanks!!!
After I read the answering post, I have tried to use these methods to decode and encode the public key, but by the time I try to compute the ECDH key I get a segmentation fault. The target of my program is to generate two EC keys, write them into several files and then, retrieve them and compute an ECDH key with them. This is the list of the things I change from my original program in the first thread, please tell me if something is wrong:
* Generate EC key (public & private)
* Decode the private key with i2d_ECPrivatekey()
* Decode the public key with i2o_ECPublickey()
* Write them into several files.
* Read the file with the public key.
* Encode it with o2i_ECPublickey()
* Read the file with the private key.
* Encode it with d2i_ECPrivatekey().
* Compute the ECDH key.(Here is where I get the segmentation fault)

I am quite fed up with this OpenSSL library...it is so inaccessible for first-time users...
","An EC public key is not an integer; it is a curve point which can be thought as a pair of integers. Those two integers are the point coordinates (often called X and Y).
Some notations: the curve is defined in a finite field. The finite field elements can be mapped to integers from 0 to q-1, where q is the field size (in the case of the curve you use, q is a prime integer slightly lower than 2192). Let n be the size in bytes of q-1: this is the size of the unsigned big endian representation of q-1, namely the integer such that 28(n-1) <= q-1 < 28n. For your curve, n = 24.
With these notations, the standard representation of a curve point consists in exactly 1+2n bytes, which are, in that order:

the byte of value 0x04
the unsigned big endian representation of x over n bytes
the unsigned big endian representation of y over n bytes

So this explains your '0x04' extra byte; also, since x and y are to be encoded over exactly n bytes, this may force the inclusion extra '0x00' bytes, in case their actual value turns out to be smaller than 28(n-1) (with your curve, this should be the case, on average, for about 1/128th of public keys).
There are other variants of this representation (compressed, in which the total size is 1+n and the first byte is 0x02 or 0x03, and hybrid, of size 1+2n, where the first byte is 0x06 or 0x07), but they are considered as optional in the ECDSA standard (X9.62-2005) and rumor has it that the compressed format is patented.
Bottom-line: if you want to encode and decode EC public keys, you should look at o2i_ECPublicKey() and i2o_ECPublicKey(), and handle them as sequence of arbitrary bytes, not encoded integers.

I'm looking to be able to generate the same kind of public-key string that you'd get from ""ssh-keygen -t ecdsa"".

You can write the private key (id_ecdsa) with PEM_write_ECPrivateKey. A quick search of the sources:
$ grep -R PrivateKey *
...
ssh-keygen.c:           ok = PEM_write_DSAPrivateKey(stdout, k->dsa, NULL,
ssh-keygen.c:           ok = PEM_write_ECPrivateKey(stdout, k->ecdsa, NULL,
ssh-keygen.c:           ok = PEM_write_RSAPrivateKey(stdout, k->rsa, NULL,


However, I don't believe OpenSSL will write the ""public-key string"" (id_ecdsa.pub) in the format string you expect:
$ cat id_ecdsa.pub 
ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlz
dHAyNTYAAABBBEs/aVnJ16NcSOTGVNbk8ifPvPbZ0Edxd7uclo/5chC81MK7
iFb/++6parCUv0FBh47MBxV+k4rxGJ1OESe4Vxs= jwalton@debian-q500

That's because OpenSSL lacks the function that applies the SSH formatting. OpenSSL only deals with DER and PEM encodings, and not SSH encodings.
For completeness, there is a call to PEM_write_EC_PUBKEY, but PEM formatting does not include prologue (like ecdsa-sha2-nistp256) or epilogue (like email address).

","@noloader reminded me that I could look in ssh-keygen.c .
This is what I found.
This is called for all key types (rsa, dsa, ecdsa):
key_to_blob(key, &blob, &len);
uu = xmalloc(2*len);
n = uuencode(blob, len, uu, 2*len);
if (n > 0) {
        fprintf(f, ""%s %s"", key_ssh_name(key), uu);
        success = 1;
}

Where key_to_blob() eventually leads to to_blob():
to_blob(const Key *key, u_char **blobp, u_int *lenp, int force_plain)
{
        Buffer b;
        int len, type;

        if (blobp != NULL)
                *blobp = NULL;
        if (lenp != NULL)
                *lenp = 0;
        if (key == NULL) {
                error(""key_to_blob: key == NULL"");
                return 0;
        }
        buffer_init(&b);
        type = force_plain ? key_type_plain(key->type) : key->type;

                    buffer_len(&key->cert->certblob));

Which eventually leads to this:
        buffer_clear(&k->cert->certblob);
        buffer_put_cstring(&k->cert->certblob, key_ssh_name(k));

        /* -v01 certs put nonce first */

","It turns out that the public-key string is PKCS8. At the command-line, you can convert from OpenSSL ECDSA to OpenSSH with OpenSSL:
$ openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out prime256v1.key.pem
$ openssl ec -in prime256v1.key.pem -pubout | ssh-keygen -f /dev/stdin -i -m PKCS8

(I wrote about it here: https://the.randomengineer.com/2014/06/28/creating-those-neat-openssh-public-keys-and-dsa-and-ecdsa-keys-with-openssl-in-general/)
Just find a PKCS8 library for whatever language you're using. For Python, it looks like both PyCrypto and Paramiko support it, based on this Gist: https://gist.github.com/jtriley/7270594
First, this:
sha1digest = hashlib.sha1(k.exportKey('DER', pkcs=8)).hexdigest()

Where exportKey contains this:
if use_pycrypto:
    key = RSA.importKey(key_fobj, passphrase=passphrase)
else:
    key = paramiko.RSAKey.from_private_key(key_fobj,
                                           password=passphrase)

","Yes it's correct, an EC private key is just a number. If you print out your PrivateKey, you'll see the X and Y coordinates of the corresponding public key.
For example, let's say the following key pair was generated (secp256r1):

EC Private Key:
1b9cdf53588f99cea61c6482c4549b0316bafde19f76851940d71babaec5e569
EC Public Key:
0458ff2cd70c9a0897eb90a7c43d6a656bd76bb8089d52c259db6d9a45bfb37eb9882521c3b1e20a8bae181233b939174ee95e12a47bf62f41a62f1a20381a6f03

We plug the private key bytes into your function:
BigInteger priv = new BigInteger(""1b9cdf53588f99cea61c6482c4549b0316bafde19f76851940d71babaec5e569"", 16);
PrivateKey privateKey = getPrivateKeyFromECBigIntAndCurve(priv, ""secp256r1"");
System.out.println(privateKey);

And print it:
EC Private Key [91:05:8a:28:94:f9:5c:cb:c4:34:b8:69:e4:39:d4:57:59:c7:51:35]

Now I need some random points from this curve to implement optimized calculation, but I can't find a way to get random points.
","What you will do is:  

Initial a EC_POINT P as generator.
Find a random bignum k such that 0 < k < order (of the group).
Do scalar multiplication to get random point R = kP

Here's a function I just wrote, which will get random EC_POINT on given EC_GROUP. The result is stored in EC_POINT r. ctx can be NULL:
int EC_POINT_get_random(const EC_GROUP *group, EC_POINT *r, BN_CTX *ctx) {
    int ok = 0;
    BN_CTX *new_ctx = NULL;
    BIGNUM *k; 

    if (ctx == NULL) {
        ctx = new_ctx = BN_CTX_new();
        if (ctx == NULL)
            return -1; 
    }   
    k = BN_new();

    if (!EC_GROUP_get_order(group, k, ctx)) goto err;
    if (!BN_pseudo_rand(k, BN_num_bits(k), 0, 0)) goto err;
    if (!EC_POINT_mul(group,r,k,NULL,NULL,ctx)) goto err;

    ok = 1;
err:
    if (k) 
        BN_free(k);
    if (new_ctx != NULL)
        BN_CTX_free(new_ctx);
    return ok; 
}   

Here's a simple test main (not well written):
int main() {
    BN_CTX *ctx;
    BIGNUM *x, *y; 
    EC_GROUP *group;
    EC_POINT *P; 

    ctx = BN_CTX_new();
    x = BN_new(); y = BN_new();

    group = EC_GROUP_new_by_curve_name(NID_secp521r1); // take curve SN_secp521r1 as sample curve
    P = EC_POINT_new(group);
    EC_POINT_get_random(group,P,ctx);   

    // print (x,y) of P

I'm at loss figuring out what is wrong: from the many tutorials and documentation pages I could find, this seems to be the right way of doing things.
Before I spend another day trying to figure out what's wrong, I figured it might smarter to ask the community: is this the right way of generating and writing an ECDHE key as PEM format with OpenSSL ?

I'd suggest deleting the two lines above. The structure should be
  cleared without this and the above line is wrong for non pointer
  fields anyway.

I used this app (https://github.com/DigitalLeaves/AsymmetricCrypto) to generate a pair of key (private and public key), using :
private let kAsymmetricCryptoManagerKeyType = kSecAttrKeyTypeEC
private let kAsymmetricCryptoManagerKeySize = 256
private let kAsymmetricCryptoManagerCypheredBufferSize = 128
private let kAsymmetricCryptoManagerSecPadding: SecPadding = .PKCS1

So, i can get the private and public key as strings as follow :
private key :3b3aef4e27c61e376bb1440f6a3077199d6d5ec665f6cd3595483a05ed96c498
public key X :3a405b5877d2939aea9dfb2995a89f4d63fca3c0cbb2a9d066fe67a08c499163
public key Y : 69bdbfc0ddea97ee03e85eb335db589cfcbee54b71f7fd74f6bc7344b5539ed6

That works perfectly.
Now, what i want is to perform a ECDH to generate a shared secret between the private key that i have generated and a public key that i get (from another platform) like a string as : 
X: b1a2166411655482ad39630a480768dde4ccce5af4c53edec82496f17f0ddbfd
Y: e6dd01508da28f4f2295d9fee86239f88e8c5cbc94dbbb1f814b27c85d0d971a

So the first question is how to transform these two last lines of string into a SecKey to produce a public key.
And the second question is how to perform a ECDH between the private key that i have generated (as a SecKey) and the new public key that i wanna get in my first question.
Here is a bit of code i used to generate my key pair :
 func createSecureKeyPair(_ completion: ((_ success: Bool, _ error: AsymmetricCryptoException?) -> Void)? = nil) {
        // private key parameters
        let privateKeyParams: [String: AnyObject] = [
            kSecAttrIsPermanent as String: true as AnyObject,
            kSecAttrApplicationTag as String: kAsymmetricCryptoManagerApplicationTag as AnyObject
        ]

        //public key parameters
        let publicKeyParams: [String: AnyObject] = [
            kSecAttrIsPermanent as String: true as AnyObject,
            kSecAttrApplicationTag as String: kAsymmetricCryptoManagerApplicationTag as AnyObject
        ]

        // global parameters for our key generation
        let parameters: [String: AnyObject] = [
            kSecAttrKeyType as String:          kAsymmetricCryptoManagerKeyType,
            kSecAttrKeySizeInBits as String:    kAsymmetricCryptoManagerKeySize as AnyObject,
            kSecPublicKeyAttrs as String:       publicKeyParams as AnyObject,
            kSecPrivateKeyAttrs as String:      privateKeyParams as AnyObject,
        ]

        // asynchronously generate the key pair and call the completion block
        DispatchQueue.global(qos: DispatchQoS.QoSClass.default).async { () -> Void in
            var pubKey, privKey: SecKey?
            let status = SecKeyGeneratePair(parameters as CFDictionary, &pubKey, &privKey)
            print(""pub :"",pubKey)

","I've found a way to do this using Bouncycastle (but would like to find a JCE way).
Adapting the code from Using public key from authorized_keys with Java security, and refering to RFC 5656, section 3.1, the following block added to decodePublicKey will parse the single BigInt value Q, which is ""the public key encoded from an elliptic curve point"":
if (type.startsWith(""ecdsa-sha2-"") &&
            (type.endsWith(""nistp256"") || type.endsWith(""nistp384"") || type.endsWith(""nistp521""))) {

        // Based on RFC 5656, section 3.1 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656#section-3.1)

        // The string [identifier] is the identifier of the elliptic curve
        // domain parameters.  The format of this string is specified in

        // Information on the REQUIRED and RECOMMENDED sets of
        // elliptic curve domain parameters for use with this algorithm can be

        if (!type.endsWith(identifier)) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Invalid identifier "" + identifier + "" for key type "" + type + ""."");
        }

        // Q is the public key encoded from an elliptic curve point into an

        // (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656#ref-SEC1)
        // point compression MAY be used.
        BigInteger q = decodeBigInt();

        ECPublicKey keyBC = getKeyBC(q, identifier);
        return keyBC;
    }

The solution I've found for getting from Q to an ECPublicKey is the following, using the Bouncycastle API (credit to Generate ECPublicKey from ECPrivateKey for providing the starting point):
ECPublicKey getKeyBC(BigInteger q, String identifier) {
    // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42639620/generate-ecpublickey-from-ecprivatekey
    try {
        // This only works with the Bouncycastle library:
        Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());
        // http://www.bouncycastle.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=362269#SupportedCurves(ECDSAandECGOST)-NIST(aliasesforSECcurves)
        String name = identifier.replace(""nist"", ""sec"") + ""r1"";
        KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""ECDSA"", ""BC"");
        ECNamedCurveParameterSpec ecSpec = ECNamedCurveTable.getParameterSpec(name);
        ECPoint point = ecSpec.getCurve().decodePoint(q.toByteArray());
        ECPublicKeySpec pubSpec = new ECPublicKeySpec(point, ecSpec);
        ECPublicKey publicKey = (ECPublicKey) keyFactory.generatePublic(pubSpec);
        return publicKey;
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException | InvalidKeySpecException | NoSuchProviderException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}

That gets you from an openssh format elliptic curve public key (ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b [256|384|521]) to a JCE ECPublicKey.

","No, you will have to debug your Applet. The issue is that 6F00 is returned when any exception is thrown by the process method other than ISOException.
This could for instance include issues regarding memory management. Once in the field, you should not allocate new objects or request transient memory arrays. Note that JavaCard has not much of a garbage collector, even if it is present.
It may also be the case that you've worn out the flash or EEPROM memory somehow. For that to happen you have to write many times to the same location or block though.

","The key you sign the data with needs to be a valid PEM-encoded private key. The DH getPrivateKey() function does not return a key in this format, it returns the bare private key data.
Your options include:

Generating a private key via the OpenSSL key generator utility or similar
Using third-party node modules to properly encode the private key as outlined in RFC 5915. Full example using the asn1.js and bn.js modules:
var crypto = require('crypto');

var asn1 = require('asn1.js');
var BN = require('bn.js');

function toOIDArray(oid) {
  return oid.split('.').map(function(s) {
    return parseInt(s, 10)
  });
}

// Define ECPrivateKey from RFC 5915
var ECPrivateKey = asn1.define('ECPrivateKey', function() {
  this.seq().obj(
    this.key('version').int(),
    this.key('privateKey').octstr(),
    this.key('parameters').explicit(0).objid().optional(),
    this.key('publicKey').explicit(1).bitstr().optional()
  );
});

// Generate the DH keys
var ecdh = crypto.createECDH('brainpoolP512t1');
ecdh.generateKeys();

// Generate the PEM-encoded private key
var pemKey = ECPrivateKey.encode({
  version: new BN(1),
  privateKey: ecdh.getPrivateKey(),
  // OID for brainpoolP512t1
  parameters: toOIDArray('1.3.36.3.3.2.8.1.1.14')

"14677715","Determine certificate key type (RSA vs EC) in .NET or BouncyCastle?","Currently we have a routine that Signs a byte[] given a certificate (and it's private key). However, the type of certificate/keys is hardcoded as ""Certificate with RSA keys"". That code is :
public byte[] Sign(byte[] bytesToSign, bool fOAEP, X509Certificate2 certificate)
{
    using (RSACryptoServiceProvider provider = new RSACryptoServiceProvider())
    {
        // HACK: Round-trip the key to XML and back, to get provider type working

We would like to make it more flexible where if the certificate uses RSA keys, we process it one way but if it uses EC keys, then we process it differently. Basically the Crypto Service Provider type would be of a different type.
So the core question is: 

Given a certificate with public+private keys (for signing) OR a certificate with just public keys (for verifying), how do you determine the types of keys used by the certificate?

I'm open to standard .NET libs or even BouncyCastle.Org libs.

"23834640","What is the purpose of the commented-out sun.security.ec.SunEC provider in java-7-openjdk?","I have a stock installation of openjdk 7u21-2.3.9-5 as included with Linux Mint Debian Edition (jessie/sid) 201403.
I'm trying to write java code to establish an SSL/TLS connection mutually-authenticated using Elliptic Curve keys.  It's not working.
Update: Since originally posting this question, I have since succeeded in establishing a secure connection by using the secp256r1 curve (rather than secp256k1) for both the server and client keys.  However I am leaving this question mostly as I originally wrote it since I still am interested in the answer to the question.  In particular I note that the security of the secp256r1 curve has been questioned.
In searching the internet for help my attention was called to the second-to-last provider listed in my java.security file:
#security.provider.9=sun.security.ec.SunEC

Why is this here?  Why is it commented out?
I have tried using SSL (TLS) client keys based on both the secp256k1 and secp256r1 curves.  I've also tried adding bouncycastle as a provider.  With the server certificate using secp256k1 I cannot establish a connection, even with the bouncycastle provider available; on the other hand, if the server and client keys are both based on the secp256r1 curve then I can establish a secure connection.
So far, my understanding is that there is a SunEC cryptographic provider that supports all EC curves but is not included with OpenJDK, that if I could find and install the proper java jar file and binary shared binary library then I could use that provider, but also that there is some incompatibility between that and the included rt.jar file.
Furthermore, I understand that the SunPKCS11 provider, which is included with OpenJDK, handles a subset of EC curves, including secp256r1, but not secp256k1.  If bouncycastle is available then it seems to kicks in when trying to use the secp256k1 curve for the client key, but not for the server key.  I have little confidence in the accuracy of my understanding because it's based on information from thread comments and other non-authoritative sources.
I am additionally confused by the fact that invoking the method sun.security.ec.NamedCurve.getECParameterSpec(""secp256k1"") returns an EC Parameter Specification, indicating that my JDK does know about that curve.  So I'm confused why it cannot handle SSL certificates using keys that are based on that curve.
At this point I am able to establish a secure connection, but only with certain EC curves.  I would like to have the option of using more curves, and in general am very curious of why there is a commented-out provider specified in the distributed java.security file.  That's my question: why is it there; how can I use it?

I am aware of various methods for mathematically defining curves; such as bezier-cruves, ellipses, etc. However I am not sure which methods would be most appropriate for use in my physics engine, because speed, feasibility of construction, and flexibility of each method must be considered. I want a system in which a user can easily form fairly complex curves, but still make the intersection calculations simple and fast. 
My physics engine is also purely continuous, which means I must be able to calculate the time in which curves will collide with other curves and lines based on a constant linear/angular velocity.

What techniques are there for mathematically defining a 2D curve? 
What are the advantages/disatvantages of each in terms of speed, flexibility, and  simplicity of construction? 
Is the technique feasible for an engine where predictability of shape intersection is crucial?

","Like your tag says, you are describing Bezier curves. It is mathematically well defined, so you'd be able to use that for collision detection, although depending on what you're doing it might make the equations slightly harder to write and solve. I don't know much about it, but something that seems to be the standard way to approach splines is NURBS, and wikipedia seems to have quite an article on the topic. The NURBS article probably covers all this, but a quick and dirty way to draw a smooth curve between a bunch of points is to use cubic splines by interpolating a cubic polynomial in between every two points such that the first derivatives match at the edges. That way you get a curve that goes through all your points and looks smooth everywhere, with no sharp corners at the initial points.

"50479284","OpenSSL: Read an EC-key, then write it again, and it's different","I wrote a wrapper for OpenSSL that supports ECC. I'm trying to read a private key that I generated with 
openssl ecparam -name secp384r1 -genkey -noout -out privkey.pem

And compare it with what OpenSSL would produce after reading the key into a EVP_PKEY and EC_KEY and printing it again into a string. The results after reading are not the same.
In short:

Read a key
Save it to EVP_PKEY
Write it again

And the results don't match. My program is quite big, so I produced an MCVE that demonstrates the problem.
My suspicion is that the problem happens because I'm reading to an EC_KEY, then writing from EVP_PKEY, which is generic. I'm guessing here because the input says it's EC, but the output doesn't say that. I'm not sure how to resolve this, because I don't see a way to write directly from an EC_KEY to a file (bio object). Is my assessment correct?

-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----

If you look closely at the first key printed, which is the one imported/exported by your code, it is labeled ""BEGIN PRIVATE KEY"" instead of ""BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY"".  It also starts with MIG2AgEAMBAGByqGSM49AgEGBSuBBAAiBIGe but after that it is identical to the original key.  In fact, if you put both PEMs in files and run openssl ec -in {filename} -text, both will output the same thing:

-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----

The extra part at the beginning is metadata from exporting a EVP_PKEY key stating that the key is an EC key.
Had you instead exported the EC_KEY directly using PEM_write_bio_ECPrivateKey(outbio, ecKey, NULL, NULL, 0, 0, NULL) the output would be exactly the same.

"50479284","OpenSSL: Read an EC-key, then write it again, and it's different","I wrote a wrapper for OpenSSL that supports ECC. I'm trying to read a private key that I generated with 
openssl ecparam -name secp384r1 -genkey -noout -out privkey.pem

And compare it with what OpenSSL would produce after reading the key into a EVP_PKEY and EC_KEY and printing it again into a string. The results after reading are not the same.
In short:

Read a key
Save it to EVP_PKEY
Write it again

And the results don't match. My program is quite big, so I produced an MCVE that demonstrates the problem.
My suspicion is that the problem happens because I'm reading to an EC_KEY, then writing from EVP_PKEY, which is generic. I'm guessing here because the input says it's EC, but the output doesn't say that. I'm not sure how to resolve this, because I don't see a way to write directly from an EC_KEY to a file (bio object). Is my assessment correct?
Please advise.

I was asked to put the whole code here in the comments, so there you go:

        std::cout << privKeyRead << std::endl;
        std::cout<<expectedPrivKey<<std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

","PEM_write_bio_ECPrivateKey is available in OpenSSL 1.0.2 too, only the documentation is missing.
The stored key is the same, the difference is only in encoding.
The tag -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- signifies a PEM-encoded ASN.1 format.
The tag -----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY----- signifies a PEM-encoded ANSI X9.62 key. 
Compare: key 1 vs. key 2. Notice key2 doesn't contain the key type OID, the key itself is identical.
To write the EC key format, just use this:
    if (!PEM_write_bio_ECPrivateKey(outbio, ecKey, NULL, NULL, 0, 0, NULL)) {

with w2=w1^k we need to solve a discrete logarithm problem in a ring of integer mod p. It can take quite a while but is still feasible given the small modulus.

Where is_probably_prime() is the Miller-Rabin test with number of trials set to 20.

So when the algorithm tries to factor a larger number which 4 divides, like 12 for example, return lenstra_elliptic_curve_factor(int(d)) + lenstra_elliptic_curve_factor(int(N/d)) adds a ""NoneType"" to a list.

","Lenstra's algorithm assumes that the number being factored is co-prime to 6 (that is, has no factors of 2 or 3). Trying to factor 4 will not work. A more realistic test is to factor 13290059.

Previosly question
For this, I want to use the CKM_ECDH1_DERIVE mechanisms. Which is supported by this HSM, see:

Referring to the PKCS#11 specification this must be considered:

The mechanism CKM_ECDH1_DERIVE must be used with the function Derive (Page 188)
The mechanism CKM_ECDH1_DERIVE expects parameter CK_ECDH1_DERIVE_PARAMS (Page 222) with this arguments:


kdf: Key derivation function used on the shared secret value (CKD)
sharedData: Some data shared between the two parties
publicData: Other party's EC public key value

The function DeriveKey expects these arguments:


Mechanism CKM.CKM_ECDH1_DERIVE
ObjectHandle PrivateKey
ObjectAttributes (Page 338)


CKA.CKA_CLASS -> CKO.CKO_SECRET_KEY
CKA.CKA_KEY_TYPE -> CKK.CKK_GENERIC_SECRET
But ""However, since these facts are all implicit in the mechanism, there is no need to specify any of them"" so these can be null?



Problem
So with this information, I tried to implement a method.
But I get this Error:

Net.Pkcs11Interop.Common.Pkcs11Exception : Method C_DeriveKey returned CKR_TEMPLATE_INCOMPLETE

at Session.DeriveKey.
Explanation of CKR_TEMPLATE_INCOMPLETE (Page 64):

If the attribute values in the supplied template, together with any default attribute
  values and any attribute values contributed to the object by the object-creation
  function itself, are insufficient to fully specify the object to create, then the attempt
  should fail with the error code CKR_TEMPLATE_INCOMPLETE.

and here (Page 98)

CKR_TEMPLATE_INCOMPLETE: The template specified for creating an object is
  incomplete, and lacks some necessary attributes. See Section 10.1 for more
  information.

But I used the nesseary attributes:

CKA.CKA_CLASS -> CKO.CKO_SECRET_KEY
CKA.CKA_KEY_TYPE -> CKK.CKK_GENERIC_SECRET

Update
Now with updated List of ObjectAttributes (thx to the answer) I get the exception Net.Pkcs11Interop.Common.Pkcs11Exception : Method C_DeriveKey returned CKR_DATA_LEN_RANGE.

CKR_DATA_LEN_RANGE: The plaintext input data to a cryptographic operation
  has a bad length.  Depending on the operation’s mechanism, this could mean that the plaintext data is too short, too long, or is not a multiple of some particular blocksize. 
  This return value has higher priority than CKR_DATA_INVALID.

For CKA.CKA_VALUE_LEN I tried different values with no success:
CKA_VALUE_LEN

Why is the public key different between pkcs15-tool and CKO.CKO_PUBLIC_KEY?
Which format does CkEcdh1DeriveParams expect for publicData? 
Do I extract the publicData the right way? Or what is the right way?
Must the value for CKA.CKA_VALUE_LEN equal to the lenght of my EC (320 Bit)?

","That's a very nice and complete description of a problem.
CKR_TEMPLATE_INCOMPLETE is always very painful to deal with because almost every library vendor expect different set of attributes to be provided and this error does not reveal which exact attributes are missing.
After a quick look at OpenSC source code I would try with following template:
var deriveAttributes = new List<ObjectAttribute>
{
    new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_TOKEN, false),
    new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_CLASS, CKO.CKO_SECRET_KEY),
    new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_KEY_TYPE, CKK.CKK_GENERIC_SECRET),
    new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_SENSITIVE, false),
    new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_EXTRACTABLE, true),
    new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_ENCRYPT, true),
    new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_DECRYPT, true),
    new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_WRAP, true),
    new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_UNWRAP, true),
    new ObjectAttribute(CKA.CKA_VALUE_LEN, ???)
};

However I am not sure what is the correct value of CKA_VALUE_LEN attribute.

where a is

I need make api using java to encrypt, decrypt and another things about Cryptografy. I'm using bouncycastle framework to do. But I can't found Elliptic Curve Cryptigrafy Engine into BC Framework, I found RSAEngine, IESEngine.
I wanna encrypt with public key, and decrypt with private key, but all exemples that I found need both keys to encrypt, so I no understand it. Like it:
Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());

    KeyPairGenerator kpg = (KeyPairGenerator) KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""ECIES"", ""BC"");

    kpg.initialize(192, new SecureRandom());

    KeyPair keyPair = kpg.generateKeyPair();

    PrivateKey privKey = keyPair.getPrivate();

    byte[] d = new byte[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}; // 1. can someone tell me what this parameters does?
    byte[] e = new byte[]{8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1};

    IESParameterSpec param = new IESParameterSpec(d, e, 192); // 2. and this parameters?

    System.out.println(c1Key.getPublic());

    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, c1Key, param);
    System.out.println(cipher.doFinal(""test12345678900987654321"".getBytes()));

But in sometimes I no have private key, as encrypt with public key.
Someone help me?
","Umm, as far as I know, ECC needs a different key for encrypting and decrypting. That's why it's called assymetric encryption.
Suppose Alice wants to send a message M(x,y) to Bob
1. The curve function is y^2 = x^3 + ax + b mod p with a reference point G(x,y)
2. Alice picks a private key nA and computes her public key Qa = nA.G
3. Bob picks a private key nB and computes his public key Qb = nB.G
4. Alice encrypts the message D = M + na.Qb (D = cipher text) and sends (Qa, D) to Bob
5. To decrypt the message, Bob computes M = D + (-nb).Qa and he recovers M 
Hope this helps.

I was able to generate a key pair using Spongycastle library, but I cannot import the key pair in the KeyStore. Firstly, because I do not have a certificate and secondly, even if I tried to create one, it did not import the key either.
I though of generating a key pair using KeyGenParameterSpec, but it's not accessible in APIs below version 23.
To sum up my question, is there a non-hacky way how to do it with general Android resources that are meant for that? Or it is simply impossible to work with elliptic curve keys on version Lollipop and lower?
","In the documentation of the Android keystore system is a section on supported key generation algorithms. It states:

Prior to API Level 23, EC keys can be generated using KeyPairGenerator
  of algorithm ""RSA"" initialized KeyPairGeneratorSpec whose key type is
  set to ""EC"" using setKeyType(String). EC curve name cannot be
  specified using this method -- a NIST P-curve is automatically chosen
  based on the requested key size.

If you can live with these limitations then you can use the Android Keystore for API levels down to API 19. It might seem that you can do down to API 18, but the necessary methods to set the key size and key type do not exist until API level 19. The name of the class used to build the parameter spec for API levels 19 through 22 inclusive is KeyPairGeneratorSpec.Builder. This is very similar to the name of the class used for API level 23 and above, KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder, so be careful not to confuse the two.
Here is a little snippet of code illustrating the above. It should run on API 19.

"7949471","Windows CNG ECDH Secret Agreement structure","I've spent a few days by searching what structure does ECDH secret agreement have, but no success. I found in MSDN that the NCryptSecretAgreement function sets a pointer to an NCRYPT_SECRET_HANDLE variable that receives a handle that represents the secret agreement value. I'm not familar with WinAPI at all so I simply can't do anything but reading docs.
I need to exchange keys between a Windows-based desktop app and a web app. What I need to know is how exactly CNG's KDF uses (hashes in my case) the secret agreement value. I'm using the SHA-256 algorithm as KDF and trying to hash X and Y of the secret agreement but result doesn't match to the one CNG computes. Any ideas?
Thank you.
","I cannot vouch for what Microsoft found fit to implement, but there is a standard on ECDH called X9.63. In that standard, ECDH works like this:

You run the DH thing, yielding the common curve point (X, Y) (that's the point you got from the peer, multiplied by your secret DH value).
You convert X (and only X; Y is discarded) into a sequence of bytes which we will call Z. Conversion is unsigned big-endian, and uses the field size: if X lives in field Fq, then the conversion yields exactly ceil(ceil(log q)/8). E.g. if you use the NIST P-521 curve, you work modulo a prime q which is such that 2520 < q < 2521, so ceil(log q) = 521 and the resulting byte sequence consists in exactly 66 bytes, whatever the value X. With the most commonly used elliptic curve (known as ""P-256""), that's 32 bytes.
To derive Z into a key, with a hash function H which has an output length of n bytes (e.g. n = 32 with SHA-256), you compute the potentially infinite string H1||H2||H3||... where ""||"" denotes concatenation, and Hi = H(Z||i) where ""i"" is represented as four bytes, using big-endian convention. In plain words, you hash Z along with a 32-bit counter, and do so again and again until you have enough bytes for your intended key length.

When you see formulae involving the coordinates of elliptic curve points, it should be understood that those calculations need to be done in the finite field the coordinates belong to, whereas you are calculating e.g. alpha just using BigInteger math. The divide in particular goes wrong as a result.
Note also that the explicit formula here won't work if the two input points have the same x-coordinate. The built-in library method handles this sort of edge case correctly, so I would recommend you use that.

{
    std::cerr << ex.what() << endl;
}

But when I try to encrypt the message using public key I got error 
CryptoPP::CryptoMaterial::InvalidMaterial: CryptoMaterial: this object contains invalid values
Here is my code:
std::string     public_point=""AsIAEFjzIcX+Kvhe8AmLoGUc8aYAEAwf5ecREGZ2u4RLxQuav/A="";

","The problem I am having is you don't appear to know what you have, and the some of the parameters you are using are wrong when taken with the other parameters. So its pretty much a stab in the dark.

First, you should wrap the disk operations in a try/catch. I/O can always cause problems, so be sure to catch exceptions related to the iostream stuff. You should also catch the Crypto++ Exception related to key loading. That will handle the ""crash"" with no information.
So your code might look something like:
try
{
    // Read key from disk, load it into Crypto++ object
}
catch(const Exception& ex)
{
    cerr << ""Caught Crypto++ exception "" << ex.what() << endl;
}
catch(const std::runtime_error& ex)
{
    cerr << ""Caught C++ runtime error "" << ex.what() << endl;
}


Second, this looks like a private exponent, and not a private key:
std::string  privatekeyString=""02C200102C180F9E6A4E7A2F58B5BE86BC179478"";

And its too big to be in P-128. Maybe you should do something like:
try
{
    AutoSeededRandomPool prng;

    std::string exponent=""02C200102C180F9E6A4E7A2F58B5BE86BC179478"";
    StringSource ss(exponent, true /*pumpAll*/, new HexDecoder);

    Integer x;
    x.Decode(ss, ss.MaxRetrievable(), Integer::UNSIGNED);        
    // cout << ""Exponent: "" << std::hex << x << endl;

    ECIES<ECP>::Decryptor decryptor;
    decryptor.AccessKey().Initialize(ASN1::secp256r1(), x);

    bool valid = decryptor.AccessKey().Validate(prng, 3);
    if(!valid)
        throw  Exception(Exception::OTHER_ERROR, ""Exponent is not valid for P-256"");

    // Or: decryptor.AccessKey().ThrowIfInvalid(prng, 3);

    cout << ""Exponent is valid for P-256"" << endl;        
}
catch(const Exception& ex)
{
    cerr << ex.what() << endl;
}


Or, you can:
ECIES<ECP>::Decryptor decryptor;
decryptor.AccessKey().AccessGroupParameters().Initialize(ASN1::secp256r1());
decryptor.AccessKey().SetPrivateExponent(x);


If you add the following to the program above:
// Encode key, use OID versus domain paramters
string encoded;
HexEncoder encoder(new StringSink(encoded));

decryptor.AccessKey().AccessGroupParameters().SetEncodeAsOID(true);
decryptor.GetKey().Save(encoder);

cout << ""Private key: "" << encoded << endl;

You will get the following for the private key:
$ ./ecies-test.exe
Exponent: 2c200102c180f9e6a4e7a2f58b5be86bc179478h
Private key: 3041020100301306072A8648CE3D020106082A8648CE3D030107042730250201010
42000000000000000000000000002C200102C180F9E6A4E7A2F58B5BE86BC179478

As you can see, the key is not ""02C200102C180F9E6A4E7A2F58B5BE86BC179478"".
The 12 leading 0's look suspicious to me. Though the exponent validates, you should verify the exponent and the field. The closest fit I could find is the curve secp160r2 (of course, curves like secp192k1 and secp224k1 work too).
The private key above is the hex encoding of ecies.priv.der shown below.

Third, this could be a public point in compressed form due to the leading 02.
std::string  privatekeyString=""02C200102C180F9E6A4E7A2F58B5BE86BC179478"";

If that is the case, then you are supposed to be able to do this, but I can't get it to decode the point (see Minimizing Key Size for Persistence on the wiki). x and y are 0 after the operation; maybe the problem is with the field:
std::string public_point=""02C200102C180F9E6A4E7A2F58B5BE86BC179478"";
StringSource ss(public_point, true, new HexDecoder);

ECIES<ECP>::Encryptor encryptor;
encryptor.AccessKey().AccessGroupParameters().Initialize(ASN1::secp128r1());

ECP::Point point;
encryptor.GetKey().GetGroupParameters().GetCurve().DecodePoint(point, ss, ss.MaxRetrievable());
cout << ""X: "" << std::hex << point.x << endl;
cout << ""Y: "" << std::hex << point.y << endl;

encryptor.AccessKey().SetPublicElement(point);
encryptor.AccessKey().ThrowIfInvalid(prng, 3);


Fourth, you should probably save the entire key, and not just the exponent. Here's a program for you that shows you how to save and load the keys. It also shows you how to perform encryption and decryption in one-liners.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Part one - generate keys

ECIES<ECP>::Decryptor decryptor(prng, ASN1::secp256r1());
ECIES<ECP>::Encryptor encryptor(decryptor);

/////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Part two - save keys

FileSink fs1(""ecies.priv.der"", true /*binary*/);
decryptor.AccessKey().AccessGroupParameters().SetEncodeAsOID(true);
decryptor.GetKey().Save(fs1);

FileSink fs2(""ecies.pub.der"", true /*binary*/);
encryptor.AccessKey().AccessGroupParameters().SetEncodeAsOID(true);
encryptor.GetKey().Save(fs2);

/////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Part three - encrypt/decrypt

string message, encrypted, recovered;

if(argc >= 2 && argv[1] != NULL)
    message = argv[1];
else
    message = ""Attack at dawn!"";

StringSource ss1 (message,   true /*pumpAll*/, new PK_EncryptorFilter(prng, encryptor, new StringSink(encrypted)));
StringSource ss2 (encrypted, true /*pumpAll*/, new FileSink(""ecies.encrypted.bin"", true /*binary*/));
StringSource ss3 (encrypted, true /*pumpAll*/, new PK_DecryptorFilter(prng, decryptor, new StringSink(recovered)));

cout << recovered << endl;


Here is what a private key looks like from the test program above. Notice it has the field encoded into the structure so you don't have to guess at it (P-256 versus P-128 versus P-521).
$ dumpasn1 ecies.priv.der 
  0  65: SEQUENCE {
  2   1:   INTEGER 0
  5  19:   SEQUENCE {
  7   7:     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ecPublicKey (1 2 840 10045 2 1)
 16   8:     OBJECT IDENTIFIER prime256v1 (1 2 840 10045 3 1 7)
       :     }
 26  39:   OCTET STRING, encapsulates {
 28  37:     SEQUENCE {
 30   1:       INTEGER 1
 33  32:       OCTET STRING
       :         00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 02 C2 00 10
       :         2C 18 0F 9E 6A 4E 7A 2F 58 B5 BE 86 BC 17 94 78
       :       }
       :     }
       :   }

And the public key:
$ dumpasn1 ecies.pub.der 
  0  89: SEQUENCE {
  2  19:   SEQUENCE {
  4   7:     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ecPublicKey (1 2 840 10045 2 1)
 13   8:     OBJECT IDENTIFIER prime256v1 (1 2 840 10045 3 1 7)
       :     }
 23  66:   BIT STRING
       :     04 08 9B D2 1C 3A DC 08 8B 1F F1 D0 F4 97 A0 87

       :   }


Crypto++ has a wiki page on ECIES. See Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme. They also have Bouncy Castle interop workarounds.

You can also PEM encode the keys, but you need a patch to do it because its not part of the library. For the patch, see PEM Pack on the Crypto++ wiki.

Everything else is fine but I want to do the above same thing using already generated 'private key' and not randomly generated 'private key' unlike the case above. How can I do this?
I have tried the following code but it just simply crashes

Edit 2
In response to @jww answer I managed to decode the message with the private key as:
  try

    // cout << ""Exponent: "" << std::hex << x << endl;

    ECIES<ECP>::Decryptor decryptor;
    decryptor.AccessKey().Initialize(ASN1::secp128r1(), x);

    bool valid = decryptor.AccessKey().Validate(prng, 3);
    if(!valid)
    {
        cout<<""Exponent is not valid for P-128""<<endl;
        return;
    }
      //  throw  Exception(CryptoPP::Exception::OTHER_ERROR, ""Exponent is not valid for P-256"");

    // Or: decryptor.AccessKey().ThrowIfInvalid(prng, 3);

    cout << ""Exponent is valid for P-128"" << endl;

    PrintPrivateKey(decryptor.GetKey());


    //get public key
    ECIES<ECP>::Encryptor encryptor(decryptor);
    PrintPublicKey(encryptor.GetKey());



    string em0; // encrypted message
    StringSource ss1(message, true, new PK_EncryptorFilter(prng, encryptor, new StringSink(em0) ) );
    cout<<""encrypted msg: ""<<em0<<""  and its length: ""<<em0.length()<<endl;

}

But when I try to encrypt the message using public key I got error

"11979732","NFC compatible tag to use for elliptic curve encryption","I have an Android project that requires me to use an NFC tag for encryption/signing data using an elliptical curve algorithm.
I need the tag to be able to perform the crypto itself using a keypair that I generate externally. It's important that the private key is stored on the tag and not transferred to Android to perform the signing.
I also need to write protect all tags so data can only be written to them if it's signed by me.
I'd like the form factor of the tag to be circular and as small as possible.
From my research so far, it's looking like I have to use Java Cards, but I'm not sure of this.
Can anyone confirm appropriate devices I could use?
","You need some micro-controller card. I have never seen those in any other form than the standard credit card form (ID-1).
A Java Card card is certainly an option, such as a NXP JCOP or Gemalto TOP card. They can be bought on-line in various places. To write an applet for such a card, requires that you have access to the SDK for that card (often available only under NDA). Java Card programming is quite unlike Java programming, furthermore it requires knowledge of such things as ISO 7816-4 and (in your case) crypto.
Another possibility could be ZeitControl BasicCard. The cards are available from various online smart card shops and from ZeitControl themselves (not all cards can do ECC). The SDK is free and available from the ZeitControl website. The programming language for the card takes some getting used to, though, but a lot of communication details are handled automatically. If you need help interfacing a BasicCard applet with an Android app, you can request additional information from ZeitControl (they were very helpful when I contacted them). It is not overly complicated, though.

Construct JSON web key and azure KeyBundle:
JsonWebKey jwk = new JsonWebKey();
jwk.CurveName = JsonWebKeyCurveName.P256;
jwk.Kty = ""EC"";
jwk.D = ec_d; // ec_d is a 32-byte byte array representing the private key
jwk.X = ec_x; // ec_x is a 32-byte byte array representing the x coordinate
jwk.Y = ec_y; // ec_x is a 32-byte byte array representing the y coordinate

Construct request:
string keyName = ""testECkey1"";
await kvClient.ImportKeyAsync(vault.Properties.VaultUri, keyName, keyBundle);

You'll need to have authenticated to Azure first. I used a lot of the example code here: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/key-vault-dotnet-authentication/blob/master/KeyVaultAuthSample.cs
Once I figured out the right jwk parameters I got the error ""EC key is not valid - bad crypto service output"". Turns out I was pushing my bytes up little endian when they needed to be big endian, so I just used Array.Reverse.
Also, I had to extract the X and Y coords from the EC public key manually. This was helpful: https://davidederosa.com/basic-blockchain-programming/elliptic-curve-keys/

what I understood so far is that Each side needs to generate a pair of
  keys (public and private) and a shared secret key which they will use
  for the encryption and decryption.. am I right?

Yes. Each side generates key pairs and sends their public keys to each other. Private keys must be kept securely and not disclosed. 
Secret key is generated from recipient private key and sender public key and vice versa. 
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is used to sign data with private key and verify it with corresponding public key.
Elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH): 

is an anonymous key agreement protocol that allows two parties, each
  having an elliptic curve public–private key pair, to establish a
  shared secret over an insecure channel.

So you need ECDH if you want to encrypt and decrypt data.

When a public key is generated I get something back like this:

Are these the 'raw bytes' or is this encoded in some form? When I use os.urandom(16) I get all kinds of messed up characters, but not from this generate public key function. Does that mean that there is some encoding? I've looked at the seccure source code, but I still don't understand why I get all these 'normal' characters.
How do I turn this into a byte array (Python bytearray) of the exact key?

"29908349","SAGE - Listing points on an elliptic curve","I have a generated elliptic curve of a modulus. I want to list just a few points on it (doesn't matter what they are, I just need one or two) and I was hoping to do:
E.points()

However due to the size of the curve this generates the error:
OverflowError: range() result has too many items

I attempted to list the first four by calling it as such: 
E.points()[:4]

However that generated the same error
Is there any way I can make it list just a few points? Maybe some Sage function?
","Since you did not include code to reproduce your situation, I take an example curve from the Sage documentation:
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(101),[23,34])

Generating random points
You can repeatedly use random_element or random_point to choose points at random:
sage: E.random_point()
(99 : 92 : 1)
sage: E.random_point()
(27 : 80 : 1)

This is probably the simplest way to obtain a few arbitrary points on the curve. random_element works in many places in Sage.
Intersecting with lines
It has the defining polynomial
sage: p = E.defining_polynomial(); p
-x^3 + y^2*z - 23*x*z^2 - 34*z^3

which is homogeneous in x,y,z. One way to find some points on that curve is by intersecting it with straight lines. For example, you could intersect it with the line y=0 and use z=1 to choose representatives (thus omitting representatives at z==0) using
sage: p(y=0,z=1).univariate_polynomial().roots(multiplicities=False)
[77]

So at that point you know that (77 : 0 : 1) is a point on your curve. You can automate things, intersecting with different lines until you have reached the desired number of points:
sage: res = []
sage: y = 0
sage: while len(res) < 4:
....:     for x in p(y=y,z=1).univariate_polynomial().roots(multiplicities=False):
....:         res.append(E((x, y, 1)))
....:     y += 1
....:
sage: res[:4]
[(77 : 0 : 1), (68 : 1 : 1), (23 : 2 : 1), (91 : 4 : 1)]

Adapting points()
You can have a look at how the points() method is implemented. Type E.points?? and you will see that it uses an internal method called _points_via_group_structure. Looking at the source of that (using E._points_via_group_structure?? or the link to the repo), you can see how that is implemented, and probably adapt it to only yield a smaller result. In particular you can see what role that range plays here, and use a smaller range instead.

","A key agreement protocol usually works between two parties each of them having an own ECDS public and private key (hence we have four different keys). Are you sure that is what you want?
Therefore when you agree to a key you need the private key of party A and the public key of party B. And on the other end of the connection you use the private key of party B and the public key of party A.
The ECDH key agreement algorithm you selected is described in RFC3278 - for details read it.

-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----

How do I get from this armored text format to a valid java.security.interfaces.ECPrivateKey and java.security.interfaces.ECPublicKey java classes?
My final goal is to sign in the following way:
String createSignatureFromJson(String jsonPayload, byte[] privateKey) {
        Payload payload = new Payload(jsonPayload)
        def key = privateKeyParse(privateKey)

        JWSSigner signer = new ECDSASigner((ECPrivateKey)key)
        JWSHeader header = new JWSHeader.Builder(JWSAlgorithm.ES256).build()

        JWSObject jwsObject = new JWSObject(header, payload)
        jwsObject.sign(signer)
        jwsObject.signature
    }

","public static ECPrivateKey privateKeyParse(byte[] privateKey) throws Exception {

        InputStream pgpIn = PGPUtil.getDecoderStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(privateKey));

        PGPObjectFactory pgpFact = new PGPObjectFactory(pgpIn, new JcaKeyFingerprintCalculator());
        PGPSecretKeyRing pgpSecRing = (PGPSecretKeyRing) pgpFact.nextObject();
        PGPSecretKey pgpSec = pgpSecRing.getSecretKey();

        PGPPrivateKey pgpPriv = pgpSec.extractPrivateKey(null);

        JcaPGPKeyConverter converter = new JcaPGPKeyConverter();
        // this is the part i was missing from Peter Dettman's answer. pass BC provider to the converter
        converter.setProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());
        PrivateKey key = converter.getPrivateKey(pgpPriv);
        return (ECPrivateKey) key;
    }

The output I was getting from

was something along the lines of [@B1ef9157 which could not be sent over SMS like I hoped for.
Java: Syntax and meaning behind "[B@1ef9157"? Binary/Address?
Instead I did this
byte[] pubEnc = aKeyPair.getPublic().getEncoded();
String s = Base64.encodeBytes(pubEnc);

making use of the Base64 encoder from http://iharder.sourceforge.net/current/java/base64/
and now I am able to successfully send the string over sms.

Can you help me?. Thank you very much.
You can download code and try to execute in SAGE here: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/39374382/question.sws
","If P1 and P2 are points on (the same) elliptic curve E and a,b are integers then
Q = a*P1 + b*P2

certainly works.  And you can get the coordinates out of the point Q using Q.xy().
Example:
sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a1')
sage: P1,P2 = E.gens(); P1,P2
((-1 : 1 : 1), (0 : -1 : 1))
sage: Q = 3*P1-2*P2; Q

"31030100","Node.js crypto module - ECDH","I'm trying to accomplish a key exchange between Node.js using the crypto module and a web client using the Web Cryptography API.
So far I managed to process the key exchange to the point where I derive the shared secret on the server and the client side. On the server side I used the 'secp521r1' curve and on the client side the equivalent curve with the name of 'P-521'.
On the client I receive a shared secret that is has a length of 32 bytes, which I assume is the correct length of an AES-GCM key with 256 bits.
But on the server I receive a key with the length of 66 bytes. Below are two examples of generated keys, one encoded in base64 and one as byte array: 
Base64 encoded:
Client AES-Key: AJQQpnOjNe2/QQz5T9NmSPFpFgUG/20739EhdjVt//I=
Server AES-Key: AJQQpnOjNe2/QQz5T9NmSPFpFgUG/20739EhdjVt//LYZ+XeuTgkwv7CJFQrqNWxnny8R+VP3nJuk1SUyDJsa7+f

Byte array:
Client AES-Key: 0,249,8,221,38,57,84,243,202,83,90,68,4,41,49,224,69,89,162,74,47,72,134,169,32,3,133,55,109,105,144,249
Server AES-Key: 0,249,8,221,38,57,84,243,202,83,90,68,4,41,49,224,69,89,162,74,47,72,134,169,32,3,133,55,109,105,144,249,66,66,131,19,81,11,27,161,132,7,244,2,191,221,162,169,247,108,128,229,211,217,109,78,5,71,232,252,243,36,214,42,199,175

I think I misconfigured something on Node.js, but i couldn't find any hints in the documentation on how to do it correctly. 
This is what i do on Node.js to extract the key:
var ecdh = crypto.createECDH('secp521r1');
ecdh.generateKeys();

ecdh.getPublicKey('base64'); // passed this to the client

// After I receive the public key of the client
var shared = ecdh.computeSecret(clientPublicKey, 'base64');

My questions are:

Is my assumption correct, that the key from Node.js is incorrect?
What do I have to do to correctly extract an AES-GCM 256 bit key?
What does the current output mean?

Any guidance is appreciated.

","This was an issue with the calculations causing a stack overflow. 
The repeated recursive division exceeded the call stack allocated to the process. 
I tried running it as an AsyncTask, but still the same issue. 
I got around this by spawning a new Thread with a lot more memory (64kb) than what Android typically allocates.
I used this constructor:
Thread(ThreadGroup group, Runnable target, String name, long stackSize)

This did resolve the issue, but I am not sure how such a simple workaround is possible!

OpenGL will not make things easier in any way. OpenGL is a drawing API, not some kind of magic scene and geometry manager. All it gives you are points, lines and triangles and methods to define how those are to be drawn to a framebuffer.
Interaction with the user lies completely outside the scope of OpenGL.

","The interaction aspect you'll need to deal with yourself. There is a recent OpenGL extension, NV_path_rendering which makes accurate, hardware-accelerated rendering of SVG and other vector formats pretty simple. The SDK includes at least one example where interaction with control points is shown, which might make a good starting place for you. Obviously, this would require you/the end user to have a GPU which supports the extension. Here's a video of the developer explaining the extension and what it can do.

string   V_S, server's identification string (CR and LF excluded)

","You don't actually need k, then, you just need to compute H.  The ECDiffieHellman class allows you to do that.
byte[] prepend = Concat(V_C, V_S, I_C, I_S, K_S, Q_C, Q_S);
byte[] exchangeHash = ecdh.DeriveKeyFromHash(otherPublic, new HashAlgorithmName(""whatever your hash algorithm is""), prepend, null);

Though that is using .NET 4.6.2 (currently in preview) API: DeriveKeyFromHash
If you are on an older framework it's still possible, but requires using the ECDiffieHellmanCng type specifically:
ecdhCng.SecretPrepend = prepend;
ecdhCng.SecretAppend = null;
ecdhCng.HashAlgorithm = new CngAlgorithm(""whatever your hash algorithm is"");
ecdhCng.KeyDerivationFunction = ECDiffieHellmanKeyDerivationFunction.Hash;
byte[] exchangeHash = ecdhCng.DeriveKeyMaterial(otherPublic);

"50077065","Get elliptic curve public key from private key using Ruby OpenSSL","I'm playing around with Elliptic Curves using the Ruby 2.5.x OpenSSL library. I can easily generate a private and public key pair using 
curve = OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new('secp256k1')
curve.generate_key

But given a private key I want to regenerate the public key. 
I know OpenSSL can do it because the command line allows you to do it, and also the Ruby Bitcoin project does it. But the Ruby Bitcoin project has its own interface to OpenSSL using FFI rather than the one provided by Ruby. 
Does Ruby 2.5.x openssl library not expose enough of the OpenSSL interfaces to be able to generate an elliptic curve public key from a private key, or that it can but it's not documented?
","The Ruby OpenSSL bindings don’t allow you to directly get the public key from a PKey::EC object as far as I can tell, but they do expose enough to do the calculation yourself, which is straightforward.
Given a private key as an OpenSSL:BN object, which for the example we can generate like this:
example_key = OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new('secp256k1').generate_key
private_key = example_key.private_key

We can calculate the public key by multiplying the group base point (i.e. the generator) by the private key:
group = OpenSSL::PKey::EC::Group.new('secp256k1')
public_key = group.generator.mul(private_key)

The public key is an OpenSSL::PKey::EC::Point. You can compare with the original to see that is the same:
puts example_key.public_key == public_key # => true

Now I want to convert these Bignum values to Base64URLEncoded values as per JWK standards.
e.g.
{

 ""crv"":""P-256"",
 ""x"":""MKBCTNIcKUSDii11ySs3526iDZ8AiTo7Tu6KPAqv7D4"",

 ""use"":""enc"",

}

Currently x coordinate is 76638B4D8040018F834AE6D6540B20E1CA95F6A8C61BE6118062918904B5C5A7
While using OpenSSL and JSONKit in ObjC as
if (!bigNum) return nil;

/* converting from BIGNUM to binary */
int len = BN_num_bytes(bigNum);
unsigned char *buf = NULL;
buf = (unsigned char *) OPENSSL_malloc (len);
len = BN_bn2bin(bigNum, buf);
NSData *pubData =  [NSData dataWithBytesNoCopy:buf length:len freeWhenDone:YES];


NSString *base64EncodedString = [pubData base64EncodedString];
return [base64EncodedString stringWithBase64URLEncoding];

On converting it, it is giving Base64URL encoded string as
x:dmOLTYBAAY-DSubWVAsg4cqV9qjGG-YRgGKRiQS1xac
But while decoding the same x coordinate on server using Jose4J is returning it as:
53548795424402895049922051400723229099982122334687022963594437126482323424679
which is similar to available on website:
http://www.mobilefish.com/services/big_number/big_number.php
From this is is indicated that it is decimal representation of BigInt
i.e.

Convert BigInt to Decimal
Decimal to ASCII String
and then to Base64 url encoding.

But while applying this process, server is not accepting the JWK param in JOSE4J library.
","I haven't done this myself, but I think it would just be BN_bn2bin() for the x and y values, then convert the resulting data into base64url. RFC 7517 Appendix A says that JWKs need the big-endian values for x and y (and d if a private key), which is what BN_bn2bin is documented to give you.
Note that base64url is slightly different than regular base64; look at RFC 7515 Appendix C for note on how to use regular base64 routines then convert the result to base64URL.

In my implementation the other peer's public key is received and stored in publickey2 and its size is stored in pub_len2

const unsigned char *publickey2 = get_public_key(&pub_len2);

then I try to create EVP_PKEY* using following code:

Do you guys have any idea?
Edit:
I've managed to solve this by using 
    pkey3 = d2i_PUBKEY(NULL, (const unsigned char **)&publickey2, pub_len2);
But I faced another problems, The main problem is that calculated derived secret from these public keys is different in both peers!
Here is my secret derivation procedure which is the same in both peers and exactly copy and pasted (with some modification) from provided link, I made some comments for the modifications reason: 
unsigned char *derive_secret(EVP_PKEY *pkey, 
const unsigned char *peer_key, 
size_t peerkey_len, size_t *secret_len)
{
    EVP_PKEY_CTX *ctx;
    unsigned char *secret;
    //MY modification to get peer key of peer_key buffer.
    //peer_key is created by i2d_PUBKEY at peer side and 
    //received by network and is passed here
    EVP_PKEY *peerkey = d2i_PUBKEY(NULL, &peer_key, peerkey_len);

    //I also set the group of newly created EC
    EC_KEY_set_group(EVP_PKEY_get1_EC_KEY(peer_key),
        EC_GROUP_new_by_curve_name(NID_X9_62_prime256v1));

    //I also set the CONVERSION format to make sure!
    EC_KEY_set_conv_form(EVP_PKEY_get1_EC_KEY(peer_key), POINT_CONVERSION_COMPRESSED);

    if(NULL == (ctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new(pkey, NULL))) handleErrors();

    /* Initialise */
    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_derive_init(ctx)) handleErrors();

    /* Provide the peer public key */

    if(1 != EVP_PKEY_derive(ctx, NULL, secret_len)) handleErrors();

    /* Create the buffer */
    if(NULL == (secret = OPENSSL_malloc(*secret_len))) handleErrors();

    /* Derive the shared secret */
    if(1 != (EVP_PKEY_derive(ctx, secret, secret_len))) handleErrors();

    EVP_PKEY_CTX_free(ctx);
    EVP_PKEY_free(peerkey);
    EVP_PKEY_free(pkey);

    /* Never use a derived secret directly. Typically it is passed
     * through some hash function to produce a key */
    return secret;
}

I also printed out sent and received public keys on both side and made sure public keys are being received in one piece and exactly the same as they created and sent!
There is also some minor problem an that is when I figured that a long bytes of public keys are the same for both peers! Is that normal for a public key of EC diffie-helman?

","some bytes (prefix) the same: all public keys in X.509-format (more exactly, SubjectPublicKeyInfo) have at least an 'object identifier' (OID), which is the same for all keys of a given algorithm (like EC), and EC keys also have 'parameters' specifying a group/curve, which is the same for all keys on the same curve -- and keys for an ECDH agreement must be on the same curve. This identical data, combined with the fact that the actual pubkeys have different values but same size, results in the ASN.1 DER encodings starting with the same bytes.
The pubkey encodings you posted use the mostly-obsolete explicit curve specification, see rfc3279 sec 2.3.5 (equivalent to X9.62 or SEC1) which is much longer than the now-preferred and often required 'named' specification. At a guess, you used OpenSSL library below 1.1.0 to generate these keys and didn't set asn1_flag in the EC_GROUP object (or group subobject of EC_KEY) before serializing (aka encoding) with i2d (or PEM_write).
The wiki page you referenced sort of covers this in section 3 ""ECDH and Named Curves"" although it only mentions private keys when this also applies to public keys and certificates -- but public key and (then) certificate are derived from private key, so setting asn1_flag on private key is sufficient. And it doesn't say that 'named' is now the default in 1.1.0 and no longer needs to be explicitly set.
your newly-posted code: point_format is meaningful only when serializing (i2d or PEM_write) so setting it on a deserialized key that will only be used and free'd (not reserialized) is useless. OTOH setting the EC group to its existing value (which was set from deserialization) is useless, but setting it to any other value will cause chaos. EC public keys are points on a specific curve and different curves have entirely different points -- a value that is a point on one curve is not a point on another curve. Also, using a get1 function and not free'ing the result leaks memory.
derivation result different: that's quite wrong for (EC)DH, and I can't reproduce it. Below is your deriviation code with the few fixes indicated above and some tiny changes to match my coding style, plus the generation code from the wiki and a trivial main to drive them, and when I run this I get pubkeys with a common prefix (shorter due to using named form) but as expected the same derivation result:

",".NET 4.6.1 added significantly better support for doing ECDSA. In particular, the GetECDsaPrivateKey (extension) method.
Since the signing and verifying methods are on the ECDsa base class (as of .NET 4.6.1) you shouldn't really have need to work directly with the ECDsaCng type, unless you're trying to interact with named system keys or other direct system interop.

","You should read more about ECC. P-256 curve(s) are based on 256-bit underlying field, however this is not the order of base point.

","The modulus p of the X9.62/SECG curve over a 256 bit prime field is

You can find this information in ec_curve.c of the OpenSSL library.
And, yes, p is a 32-byte number. In ECC, while p usually represents the modulus of a prime field, P usually represents a point on the elliptic curve, where P = [k]G, 0<k<p-1 and G is the generator of the curve.

"22376901","Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Symmetric Keys Not Matching On Client and Server","I'm using JCSL - Javascript on client (documentation) and OpenSSL - Ruby on server (documentation) to generate a symmetric key on both client and server using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman.
I've somehow finally managed to format properly the public keys to be sent by the Client and Server, and I've finally generated a symmetric key without anymore runtime errors (my previous question)
However, the problem now is that Client's Symmetric Key != Server's Symmetric Key

Convert ECIES ECP CryptoPP to JAVA

To get the point out of Crypto++, its about as hard as:
// Assuming your key was DER Encoded
byte key[Z3_KEY_LENGTH] = ...;

ECIES<ECP>::Decryptor decryptor;
decryptor.BERDecodePublicKey(ArraySource(key, sizeof(key)).Ref(), false, sizeof(key));

const ECPPoint& point = decryptor.GetPublicElement();
const Integer& x = point.x;
const Integer& y = point.y;

If your key was not DER Encoded, refer to Keys and Formats from the Crypto++ wiki. You also have the wiki page on Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme.
Java 7 provides and ECPoint class, and it takes an X and Y coordinate.

> ECIES<ECP>::Decryptor ellipticalEnc( keyStr );
> unsigned char *tmpBuffer( new unsigned char[ src.Size() ] );
> DecodingResult dr = ellipticalEnc.Decrypt( rng, src.Data(), src.Size(), tmpBuffer );

This does not look quite right, but you have not showed enough code.
size_t maxLength = decryptor.MaxPlaintextLength( src.Size() );
unsigned char *tmpBuffer = new unsigned char[ maxLength ];

DecodingResult dr = ellipticalEnc.Decrypt( rng, src.Data(), src.Size(), tmpBuffer );
if( !result.isValidCoding )
    throw runtime_error(""failed to decrypt cipher text"");

unsigned char *buffer = new unsigned char[ result.messageLength ];
std::cpy(tmpBuffer, buffer, result.messageLength);

"12924059","Extracting a part of OpenSSL into one single, preprocessed source file","I'm currently researching the possibility of speeding up ECDSA signature verification via OpenCL in Bitcoin.
For this task I will first of all need both a bignum implementation in C (since OpenCL code is a subset of C), and an implementation of elliptic curve math, also in C. OpenSSL has very well-tested implementations of both these libraries, so my plan is to extract these two components from the ""crypto""-part of OpenSSL, and see if I can adapt the resulting C code to OpenCL-compatible code (by replacing all dynamic memory allocation with static allocation, for one thing).
My current knowledge on the subject suggests there are no readily available tools for accomplishing this. I have looked at other SO questions, and one of them suggested writing a Python script which will extract a function and all of its dependencies. To get started with this it would be useful to have one single, preprocessed file containing all the source code used by the crypto-part of OpenSSL. Is there an easy way to do this?
When, or if, this is accomplished, I will have to write a script that can extract a function from a source file given its name. I figure the script should then recursively call itself for any new, unknown function that it sees in the function it's trying to extract, and extract this as well, repeating this process recursively in the child functions it visits. Does this seem like a sensible approach?
Thanks :)

"43124595","Generate a random point on an elliptical curve","I'm writing a program which randomly chooses two integers within a certain interval. I also wrote a class (which I didn't add below) which uses two numbers 'a' and 'b' and creates an elliptical curve of the form:
y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
I've written the following to create the two random numbers.
def numbers():
n = 1
while n>0:
    a = random.randint(-100,100)
    b = random.randint(-100,100)
    if -16 * (4 * a ** 3 + 27 * b ** 2) != 0:
        result = [a,b]
        return result
    n = n+1

Now I would like to generate a random point on this elliptical curve. How do I do that?
","The curve has an infinite length, as for every y ϵ ℝ there is at least one x ϵ ℝ so that (x, y) is on the curve. So if we speak of a random point on the curve we cannot hope to have a homogeneous distribution of the random point over the whole curve. 
But if that is not important, you could take a random value for y within some range, and then calculate the roots of the following function:
    f(x) = x3 + ax + b - y2
This will result in three roots, of which possibly two are complex (not real numbers). You can take a random real root from that. This will be the x coordinate for the random point.
With the help of numpy, getting the roots is easy, so this is the function for getting a random point on the curve, given values for a and b:
def randomPoint(a, b):
    y = random.randint(-100,100)
    # Get roots of:  f(x) = x^3 + ax + b - y^2
    roots = numpy.roots([1, 0, a, b - y**2])
    # 3 roots are returned, but ignore potential complex roots
    # At least one will be real
    roots = [val.real for val in roots if val.imag == 0]
    # Choose a random root among those real root(s)
    x = random.choice(roots)
    return [x, y]

","I don't think you'll find anything better than the paper linked at Using same keypair for Diffie-Hellman and signing.
I suspect that this key reuse is fine as long as you're comfortable with assumption that SHA-512 (used in Ed25519 signing) and HSalsa (used as KDF with NaCl's Curve25519 based boxes) are independent hash functions (I do). But it'd be probably cleaner to use the same hash function with different prefixes.
I heard that Bernstein, Lange and Schwabe (authors of NaCl) are working on a paper about these issues, but who knows when it'll be published.

"13495766","Moving multiple sprites in elliptical path with uniform speed","I'm trying to move multiple sprites (images) in an elliptical path such that distance (arc distance) remains uniform. 
I have tried

Move each sprite angle by angle, however the problem with this is that distance moved while moving unit angle around major axis is different than that while moving unit angle around minor axis - hence different distance moved.
Move sprites with just changing x-axis uniformly, however it again moves more around major axis. 

So any ideas how to move sprites uniformly without them catching-up/overlapping each other?
Other info:

it will be called in onMouseMove/onTouchMoved so i guess it shouldn't
be much CPU intensive. 
Although its a general algorithm question but
if it helps I'm using cocos2d-x

","So this is what i ended up doing (which solved it for me):
I moved it in equation of circle and increased angle by 1 degree. Calculated x and y using sin/cos(angle) * radius. And to make it into an ellipse I multiplied it by a factor.
Factor was yIntercept/xIntercept.
so it looked like this in end
FACTOR = Y_INTERCEPT / X_INTERCEPT;

//calculate previous angle
angle = atan((prev_y/FACTOR)/prev_x);

//increase angle by 1 degree (make sure its not radians in your case)
angle++;

//new x and y
x =  cos(newangle) * X_INTERCEPT;
y =  sin(newangle) * X_INTERCEPT * FACTOR;

"37562264","How does Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman work on JavaCard, in combination with Java?","I'm trying to get Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman to work on a JavaCard (version 2.2.1).
On the JavaCard, I have the following code right now:
byte temp[] = new byte[100];
byte secret[] = new byte[100];
byte size = buf[ISO7816.OFFSET_LC];

Util.arrayCopy(buf, ISO7816.OFFSET_CDATA, temp, (byte) 0, size);

// the public key is in temp
short len = dh.generateSecret(temp, (byte) 0, size, secret, (byte) 0);

Util.arrayCopy(temp, (byte) 0, buf, ISO7816.OFFSET_CDATA, size);
//Util.arrayCopy(secret, (byte) 0, buf, ISO7816.OFFSET_CDATA, len);
apdu.setOutgoingAndSend(ISO7816.OFFSET_CDATA, size);

And I initialize dh as follows:
keyPair = new KeyPair(KeyPair.ALG_EC_FP, KeyBuilder.LENGTH_EC_F2M_163);
keyPair.genKeyPair();
dh = KeyAgreement.getInstance(KeyAgreement.ALG_EC_SVDP_DH, false);
dh.init(keyPair.getPrivate());

All of this seems to work, except for the dh.generateSecret call, where the applet simply seems to crash. If I leave the call out, and return other data, that works nicely. In which I import the data that is sent by the terminal. In the terminal, I have the following:
// generate an ecdh keypair
KeyPairGenerator keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""EC"");
keyGen.initialize(163);
KeyPair keyPair = keyGen.generateKeyPair();

// initialize DH
KeyAgreement dh = KeyAgreement.getInstance(""ECDH"");
dh.init(keyPair.getPrivate());

//byte encKey[] = keyPair.getPublic().getEncoded();

// X9.62 encoding, no compression
int qLength = (163+7)/8;
byte[] xArr = ((ECPublicKey) keyPair.getPublic()).getW().getAffineX().toByteArray();
byte[] yArr = ((ECPublicKey) keyPair.getPublic()).getW().getAffineY().toByteArray();
byte[] enc2 = new byte[1+2*qLength];
enc2[0] = (byte) 0x04;
System.arraycopy(xArr, 0, enc2, qLength - xArr.length, xArr.length);
System.arraycopy(yArr, 0, enc2, 2* qLength - yArr.length, yArr.length);

byte res[] =send((byte) 0x00, enc2).getData();

I have tried several things. Right now, the code that sends the public key tries to encode it in X9.62 encoding (uncompressed) as specified by the JavaCard docs. However, I've also tried the default encode method, which gives exactly the same result.
I don't seem to be able to get any error out of the JavaCard about what is going wrong. Does anyone know what is going wrong? Or does anyone have a working example on how to do a key-exchange on a JavaCard?
","As vojta already indicated:
keyPair = new KeyPair(KeyPair.ALG_EC_FP, KeyBuilder.LENGTH_EC_F2M_163);

just tries to generate a key pair, and it probably works up to a point. But an Fp curve is different from a F2m curve, and to my knowledge there are no 163 bit Fp curves (to my knowledge anyway).
This means that you never actually installed the domain parameters, unless you generated your own, and I would call that unlikely.
Use a Fp curve with a known key length and set the parameters, at least for the public key (for JCOP cards you may have to set them for the private key as well). You'd normally use a 224 bit key size or higher to be secure.

Why P-521 public key X,Y  not like P-256 or P-384 that have a fixed public key  length?
","secp521r1 uses a 521-bit prime field.  So the X or Y coordinates are represented as 521-bit numbers.  Yes, 521, not 512.
521 bits is 65 full bytes and one bit left over.  In a fixed-size encoding of the public key the most significant byte would always have the 7 most significant bits set to 0, and the 8th bit will be 1 or 0 (so the whole byte is 0x00 or 0x01).
Since the coordinate space isn't quite all of the 521-bit numbers, you have a slightly less than 50% chance of the high bit being set for any particular point.
Go's method seems to be returning the value using a minimum-byte representation.  So you should see something like

66 bytes: 49% of the time
65 bytes: 50% of the time
64 bytes (top 9 bits are all 0): 0.2%

I've assumed that by properly converting one, it can somehow become equal to the other since they have same curve parameters. Or am I wrong? (And also because the default format of point_conversion_form is :uncompressed, as I just have tested) Please help.
P.S. You might wonder why I need to convert the public key into the other. No, I don't really have to. I just want to learn how to convert it as I'll be using that method to convert something similar. And this is the simplified question for your testing-convenience.

It would probably be better to print that in hex.
The public key is a point on the curve. That is, its an (x,y) coordinate. So that value probably needs to be split (hence the reason for printing in hex). Taking a guess:
x = 499599043529551953518354858381998373780
y = 459818901085313561109939106744612770290

The public key is a point because its derived from the base point G, which is also a point. G is sometimes expanded as (g_x, g_y). The private exponent is a (or b), which is a scalar or integer. So the public key is A=G^a or A=(g_x, g_y)^a, which is a point.


And also because the default format of point_conversion_form is :uncompressed, as I just have tested

Point conversion/compression is just a presentation layer optimization trick. It omits the y portion of the coordinate because you can solve for it given x. Because its a curve, sometimes you need to send +1 or -1 to specify the quadrant the y coordinate lies in. But again, its just an optimization and only matters for interop'ing. After you read the point into a library, both x and y are available.


You might wonder why I need to convert the public key into the other...

Nope :)
But one thing you might want to be aware of is OpenSSL's ""named curve"" flag. If you want to load an EC key into an OpenSSL based server, you will want to ensure the private key and resulting certificate have the OPENSSL_EC_NAMED_CURVE flag. Otherwise, you'll get bizarre errors like ""no shared ciphers"" when trying to connect to the server. See ECDH and Named Curves on the OpenSSL wiki for details.

","Jay-Ar, 
You shouldn't find your solution weird as I think the call to ec.public_key.to_bn might be adhering to rfc5480 section 2.2 re: Subject Public Keys which states:

2.2.  Subject Public Key

The first octet of the OCTET STRING indicates whether the key is
      compressed or uncompressed.  The uncompressed form is indicated
      by 0x04 and the compressed form is indicated by either 0x02 or
      0x03 (see 2.3.3 in [SEC1]).  The public key MUST be rejected if
      any other value is included in the first octet.


Assuming this is the case and since you stated the format is :uncompressed, your own answer makes total sense to me.  Thanks for posting it! :)

Lets take curve y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 modulo 13. Z_13 = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ]. Quadratic residue ( QR ) = [ 0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12] and Quadratic non residue ( QNR )= [ 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11] of Z_13. Take x = 0 and we have y^2 = 1 ( mod 13 ) since 1 is in QR so solution for this equation is 1 and 12. We get two points ( 0, 1 ) and ( 0, 12 ). Putting x = 1, y^2 = 3 ( mod 13 ) so points corresponding to x = 1 is ( 1, 4 ) and ( 1, 9). Putting x=2, y^2 = 11 ( mod 13 ) and 11 is QNR so we don't have solution. Whenever a solution exists, it gives us two points and both are inverse of each other modulo prime p ( 13 in this case ). Total points on given curve is ( 0, 1 ), ( 0, 12 ), ( 1, 4 ), ( 1, 9 ), ( 4, 2 ), ( 4, 11 ), ( 5, 1 ), ( 5, 12 ), ( 7, 0 ), ( 7, 0 ), ( 8, 1 ), ( 8, 12 ), ( 10, 6 ), ( 10, 7 ), ( 11, 2 ), ( 11, 11 ). You can try all the points and see which one generate the whole group. 
 *Main>take 20 . iterate ( addP ( 1 , 1 , 13 )  ( P 7 0 ) ) $ ( P 7 0  )
 [P 7 0,O,P 7 0,O,P 7 0,O,P 7 0,O,P 7 0,O,P 7 0,O,P 7 0,O,P 7 0,O,P 7 0,O,P 7 0,O]

Coming back to Elgamal system
1. Bob chose elliptic curve E( a, b) over GF( p ) or GF ( 2^n ).
2. Bob chose a point on the curve e1( x1, y1 )
3. Bob chose an integer d.
4. Bob calculate e2(x2, y2 ) = d * e1( x1, y1 ).
5. Bob announce E( a, b, p ), e1( x1, y1 ) and e2( x2, y2) as your public key and keeps d as private key
Encryption. 
Alice selects P, point on the curve, as her plain text. She chose a random number r and computes C1 = r * e1, C2 = P + r * e2. 
Decryption.
Bob after receiving C1 and C2, computes C2 - d * C1 => P + r * e2 - d * r * e1 
=> P + r * d * e1 - d * r * e1 => P 
Edit: You are correct! If you take generator element and keep adding it then you can generate the whole group. See the lecture by Christof Paar[1].

So I am curious if is there any working implementation of NTRU algorithms with same capabilities as GnuPG. I know that there is a lot of implementation of NTRUEncrypt (http://www.yassl.com/yaSSL/Products-cyassl.html, http://sourceforge.net/projects/ntru/ or answers here: NTRUEncrypt source code?). I even found some implementation with NTRUSign (https://github.com/tbuktu/ntru), but they say that the NTRUSign was broken and should not be used (here is how it was broken http://www.di.ens.fr/~ducas/NTRUSign_Cryptanalysis/DucasNguyen_Learning.pdf), so as far I know, there is no secure algorithm for NTRUSign. (that analysis from 2012 includes ""secure versions"" of NTRUSign (like adding perturbations), the pure NTRUSign was broken in 2006)
1) My first question is, am I wrong? 
Is there any secure (or not yet broken, which (I know) is  a significant difference). Or is there any secure Digital signature algorithm, which I may use for opensource without paying a lot for a licence and secure against bruteforce. I am mostly thinking of using ECDSA but I do not know how it is with patens and how secure is it. My second question: 2) Is there any secure digital signature other than DSA, ECDSA and RSA-PSS (and other RSA based), which would be good for signing messages?  I know that there are others (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) but that is all I know about them.
And my third question 3) Is there any ECC implementation behaving similarly to GnuPG? 
Ok, after I wrote the question I found this: https://code.google.com/p/gnupg-ecc/, so I will answer it right now. (Someone could find it useful)
And 4) Is there any other implementation of  asymetric encryption for both encrypting and signing as alternative to RSA,ElGamal,ECC?

So I tried JECC and it worked just fine, except for one problem.  When using the ""secp256r1"" curve, I could only encode 20 bytes, 160 bits, before it gave me an ""index out of range"" error.
Is this a limitation with JECC, Elliptic Curves in general, or maybe my own code?  I tried researching the problem online and can't find any reference to how much data a 256 bit ECC key can encode.  With RSA, I could encode any data smaller then the key used.
Additionally, how important is data padding with ECC? I couldn't find any information on standard padding practices with ECC.

byte[] digest = hash.digest();
for(int j = 0; j < numbytes; j++) {
    res[j+ek.mother.getPCS()]=(byte) (input[j]^digest[j]);

It seems the data is xored against the hash. If I change the ""SHA-1"" to ""SHA-256"", I no longer get the error.
Now I'm not a cryptographer, and I'd rather not change the core functionality of JECC, but is this a valid solution?
","The reason why JECC only encrypts 20 bytes of plaintext is that during encryption process it tries to XOR the input with digest value. The digest length of SHA-1 used by JECC is 160 bits(20 bytes). 
Also JECC doesn't encrypt the data using ECC, rather it's a prototype of ECIES, which involves generating symmetric key using ECC Diffie Hellman key exchange and than using any custom symmetric encryption algorithm.

My questions are:
1) Why does OpenSSL Ruby yields only one key while that size yields two keys: x and y (as I've assumed x and y won't be concatenated with each other since the bitsize will be too long when compared to the Ruby symmetric key)
2) Is there a way to convert the two symmetric keys (OpenSSL and JSBN-EC library above) from one another? All my attempts to convert failed.
I've been struggling for a week now implementing Ruby OpenSSL with that JSBN-EC library. I've also tried (SJCL library) but similar results (symmetric keys don't match). Please help.
","I've managed to work it out now with working symmetric keys on client (JSBN-EC) and on server OpenSSL Ruby
I found out that my problem actually lies in the code itself. After fixing it, I've ended up with a symmetric key on OpenSSL Ruby as follows:
#Ruby: OpenSSL
...
...
symm_key = ec.dh_compute_key(point)
symm_key.unpack('B*').first.to_i(2) #Converts to binary, then to integer
#--> 6922380353406615622038660570577625762884344085425862813095878420328

While on the client side using JSBN-EC
#Javascript: JSBN-EC
...
...
var curve = get_curve();
var P = new ECPointFp(curve,
curve.fromBigInteger(server_pub_key_x),
curve.fromBigInteger(server_pub_key_y));
var a = client_priv_key;
var S = P.multiply(a);

console.log('SYMM_KEY X: '+S.getX().toBigInteger().toString());
//--> 6922380353406615622038660570577625762884344085425862813095878420328
console.log('SYMM_KEY Y: '+S.getY().toBigInteger().toString());
//--> 14426877769799867628378883482085635535383864283889042780773103726343

Therefore from the looks of it, the symmetric key that matches the Ruby OpenSSL value is the  X value of the JSBN-EC symmetric key
6922380353406615622038660570577625762884344085425862813095878420328

I don't know what the Y value is now for. Looks like I won't need it. Cheers! :)

I set up a TLS v1.2 connection to google.com using cipher suite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xc02f).  I captured traffic with Wireshark and I can see the client hello, server hello, certificate, and server key exchange messages.  My understanding is that the EC public key that Google sent is signed using the private key of certificate Google sent (RSA, in this case).

02 - SHA-1 hash
01 - RSA signature
0100 - length of signature
7ec0b1...588c [256 bytes] - signature value
Using the certificate I received in the certificate message, I was able to perform a public key operation on the signature of the EC public key and it looks like a properly padded SHA-1 hash.  However, I cannot verify this hash value.  I tried many different combinations of the raw EC public key with its headers, but nothing I tried hashes properly.  
Here is how I retrieved the hash:
openssl rsautl -inkey ~/googlePubKey.pem -encrypt -in ~/googleECpubkeysig -pubin -raw | hexdump
0000000 0100 ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff
0000010 ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff

00000f0 9ff8 77f1 6a69 09af 472a 90b2 cac6 b4f8
0000100
The last 20 bytes look like a SHA-1 hash, which is the algorithm specified in the signature.  Which bytes from the Server Key Exchange should I be hashing to get this value?  Or, is there some transformation or other data that I must perform or add prior to hashing?  
","I was missing the client random and server random.  Thanks to JamesKPolk for the references and this related post for mentioning the two random values in one of the comments: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/80619/tls-1-2-handshake-how-is-the-ecdhe-public-key-signed-by-server.
The full value to hash for my example above (with hex values in parentheses) is:
client_random (32 bytes) + server_random (32 bytes) + named_curve (0x03) + secp256r1_curve (0x0017) + length_of_public_key (0x41) + first_byte_of_key (0x04) + key_x_value + key_y_value
When I used this value the hash matched and the signature verified OK.

Other than that there is only my function to reduce the amount of operations to point doublings and additions.  I have worked out many examples by hand so I know the data coming out of this function is correct.  
The weird thing is that I have tried this on an example in my cryptography class with values m=17 x=5 y=1 a=2 and I am getting all the values I should be getting.  I didn't code a way for the values to 'wrap around' once the inverse of the base point is reached but since with bitcoin the private key space is much much smaller than the modulo value so we shouldn't even reach that point when values start repeating themselves. I am about to cry with how frustrating this is so any help would be wonderful.  
Oh also there is one other weird thing.  Here is an example when I run it.

It's not obvious but the last 19 hex digits are the same but the rest is different? They are the same length by the way.  Could this be something wrong with the BigInteger Library?  This was a way that seemed simple to me but would you recommend I did it a different way?

Following a DH shared secret negotiation I'm interested in deriving common shared keys.  According to TR-03111 and X9.63 the shared secret from the DH ECC key agreement should not be used but, according to my understanding, the affine representation of the x-coordinate (The x component of the public key associated with the shared secret as a private key) is to be used.
With BigInteger arithmetic or ECPoint.multiply() this easy, but no such APIs exist in Java Card.
","This multiplication isn't directly available for Java Card. Basically Java Card hides low level operations for you.
However, if you have a relatively new Java Card you may get away with this by using a KeyAgreement instance created using ALG_EC_SVDP_DH_PLAIN_XY. What you can do is to create a ECPublicKey where the public key point is simply set to point G. This base point G is part of the domain parameters. The private key should of course be set to your value.
Then all it comes down to is to perform a key agreement; the result of the agreement will be the points X and Y of the public key.

Note that support of any algorithm constant depends on the card implementation. The constant will be there - if the implemented API is new enough - but the algorithm may not be implemented.

Your elliptic curve just has too many points for Python to deal with, much less to plot.  What I would suggest is to start by getting a few points and then using the group law to generate a sample of points and plot that.  I don't know if you'll be able to do that with ""out of the box"" behavior or if you'll have to imitate the code in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_finite_field.py in _points_via_group_structure(self) as in the traceback.

I believe I am either doing something wrong in the conversion from Montgomery to Weierstrass equation, or I am not using the proper classes to provide custom EC parameters.
Does somebody already succeeded in using custom EC parameters for key pair generation ? Perhaps for another Montgomery or Edwards curve ?
","I believe is not possible to generate EC key pairs based on custom EC curves in LunaProvider using Luna's JSP API. However, it is possible to generate EC key pairs using JCProv API(by Luna). JCProv - PKCS#11 Java Wrapper which is a lower level API close to PKCS#11 implementation. You can use CryptokiEx.C_GenerateKey(..) method to generate key pairs. PKSC#11 C_GenerateKey() method documentation can be found here.

"44829426","Can I create a JCE ECPublicKey from a Q value from an openssh public key and ECParameterSpec","I'm reading openssh format elliptic curve public keys (RFC 5656, section 3.1) and would like to get from a BigInteger Q value to an ECPublicKey instance using JCE (rather than say BouncyCastle). I want to do this to verify JWT signatures.
e.g. https://api.github.com/users/davidcarboni/keys: 
ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBK8hPtB72/sfYgNw1WTska2DNOJFx+QhUxuV6OLINSD2ty+6gxcM8yZrvMqWdMePGRb2cGh8L/0bGOk+64IQ/pM=

It looks like I can use ECPublicKeySpec. This takes two parameters. An ECPoint and an ECParameterSpec. I'm able to get the parameter spec using the following JCE code (and the openssh identifier from the key data, say ""nistp256""):
ECParameterSpec getECParameterSpec(String identifier) {
    try {
        AlgorithmParameters parameters = AlgorithmParameters.getInstance(""EC"");
        String name = identifier.replace(""nist"", ""sec"") + ""r1"";
        parameters.init(new ECGenParameterSpec(name));
        return parameters.getParameterSpec(ECParameterSpec.class);
    } catch (InvalidParameterSpecException | NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Unable to get parameter spec for identifier "" + identifier, e);
    }
}

I've successfully parsed the Q value from the key data. RFC 5656 tells me that ""Q is the public key encoded from an elliptic curve point into an octet string"") however the constructor of JCE's ECPoint class takes two parameters, X and Y.
Can I get to X and Y from Q, or do I need to take a different approach? 
(NB I quite rightly don't have access to the private key)

65 63 64 jumped out to me as ""ecd"" (sure enough, ""ecdsa-sha2-nistp256"").
So the blob looks to be

Big Endian length of a string/payload (19)
The string ""ecdsa-sha2-nistp256""
Big Endian length of a string/payload (8)
The string ""nistp256""
Big Endian length of a payload (0x41 == 65)
The encoded ECPoint Q (04 AF 21 ... 10 FE 93)

The encoded ECPoint starts with 04 indicating it is an uncompressed point (the most common encoding).  The 04 encoding rules (from http://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf, 2.3.5, step 3) say that the remaining payload is X and Y, each left-padded with zeros to the encoding size of the curve field.
So your ECPoint looks like
04
Qx:
AF 21 3E D0 7B DB FB 1F 62 03 70 D5 64 EC 91 AD
83 34 E2 45 C7 E4 21 53 1B 95 E8 E2 C8 35 20 F6

16 F6 70 68 7C 2F FD 1B 18 E9 3E EB 82 10 FE 93

In C# you'd need to a) reverse the bytes of each of Qx and Qy (because the .NET BigInteger expects Little Endian, and these are Big Endian) and b) put a padding 0x00 byte as more significant than the 0xAF and 0xB7 bytes, since they have their high bits set (and would be interpreted as negative numbers).  Don't know if Java has either of those quirks.

PublicKey publicKey = KeyFactory.getInstance(""ECDH"", ""SC"").generatePublic(new X509EncodedKeySpec(pubK2));

using the following code, I manage to get same shared secret for both Alice and Bob                 
keyAgreement.init(privateKey);
keyAgreement.doPhase(publicKey, true);

byte[] sharedSecret = SHA256(keyAgreement.generateSecret());

but I specify nowhere my special curve prime192v1
If I try to supply this in this way:
org.spongycastle.jce.spec.ECParameterSpec ecSpec = ECNamedCurveTable.getParameterSpec(""prime192v1"");

keyAgreement.init(privateKey, ecSpec);
keyAgreement.doPhase(publicKey, true);

byte[] sharedSecret = SHA256(keyAgreement.generateSecret());

an Exception is thrown saying
java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: No algorithm parameters supported

Why can't I supply my desired parameter? Does the KeyAgreement somehow deduce this from the private key?
Thanks!

","Actually, El Gamal scheme, being based on Diffie–Hellman key exchange, presumes an asymmetric encryption algorithm, with private and public keys, so you should consider this. Computing the public key in this scheme will be as difficult as computing the discrete logarithm in the group.

Given that for public key I have only X and Y coordinates. How to generate publicKey from this values?
ECDH.Agree(key,privateKey, getPublicKey(X,Y))

{x,y} is a point on the curve, but its never been easy to work with it directly.
This is all we really want to do but it does not work. The problem is ECDH::Domain are only domain parameters. The public point and the private exponent are layered on top.
OID curve = ASN1::secp256r1();
DL_GroupParameters_EC<ECP> params(curve);

Integer x(""..."");
Integer y(""..."");
ECP::Point q(x, y);

DL_PublicKey_EC<ECP> pubKey;
pubKey.Initialize(params, q);

ECDH < ECP >::Domain theirs(pubKey);

To further complicate matters, the keys produced by the ECDH protocol are temporary or ephemeral. They are not meant to be persisted; rather, they are meant to be used once and discarded. So Crypto++ does not make it easy to persist them (by, say, providing a DEREncode).
Analysis
To use the {x,y} coordinate, we need to figure out how the library is using it. The ephemeral public and private keys are created in pubkey.h around line 1380. The code for them is below:
void GeneratePrivateKey(RandomNumberGenerator &rng, byte *privateKey)
{
    Integer x(rng, Integer::One(), GetAbstractGroupParameters().GetMaxExponent());
    x.Encode(privateKey, PrivateKeyLength());
}

void GeneratePublicKey(RandomNumberGenerator &rng, const byte *privateKey, byte *publicKey)
{
    const DL_GroupParameters<T> &params = GetAbstractGroupParameters();
    Integer x(privateKey, PrivateKeyLength());
    Element y = params.ExponentiateBase(x);
    params.EncodeElement(true, y, publicKey);
}

The line of interest above is the params.EncodeElement(true, y, publicKey). To see what's going on there, we need to look at eccrypto.h around line 70, and note that reversible is true:
void EncodeElement(bool reversible, const Element &element, byte *encoded)
{
    if (reversible)
        GetCurve().EncodePoint(encoded, element, m_compress);
    else
        element.x.Encode(encoded, GetEncodedElementSize(false));
}

params.EncodeElement calls ECP::EncodePoint. To see what that does we can examine ecp.cpp around line 120. The routine writes a uncompressed point, but blocks x and y on the maximum size of the public element, which should be the field size or the subgroup order.
void ECP::EncodePoint(BufferedTransformation &bt, const Point &P, bool compressed)
{
    if (P.identity)
        NullStore().TransferTo(bt, EncodedPointSize(compressed));
    else if (compressed)
    {
        bt.Put(2 + P.y.GetBit(0));
        P.x.Encode(bt, GetField().MaxElementByteLength());
    }
    else
    {
        unsigned int len = GetField().MaxElementByteLength();
        bt.Put(4);      // uncompressed
        P.x.Encode(bt, len);
        P.y.Encode(bt, len);
    }
}

Don't worry too much about the BufferedTransformation. There are ways to turn a byte[] into one, and it happened before the code shown above. If you trace the code, you will see its transformed via an ArraySource:
byte myArray[PublicEphemeralKeyLength()];
ArraySource as(myArray, COUNTOF(myArray));

Above, as is a BufferedTransformation that wraps the byte[] you passed into the function.
The final open question is the maximum size of the field element. That appears to be the modulus size less one, in bytes:
$ grep -I -A 1 MaxElementByteLength modarith.h 
    unsigned int MaxElementByteLength() const
        {return (m_modulus-1).ByteCount();}

Agreement
Given the above information, here's what you should do. You need to supply the values for x and y in ECP::Point q(x,y). They are just Crypto++ Integers.
OID curve = ASN1::secp256r1();
DL_GroupParameters_EC<ECP> params(curve);

size_t size = params.GetEncodedElementSize(true);
vector<byte> othersPublicKey(size);

ECP::Point q(x,y);
params.EncodeElement(true, q, &othersPublicKey[0]);

Then you can call:
ecdh.Agree(key, myPrivateKey, &othersPublicKey[0]);

One note: params.GetEncodedElementSize(true) should equal PublicEphemeralKeyLength(). If they are not equal, then something is wrong.

If you need to modify compression, then you can:
params.SetPointCompression(true);

","PublicKey is a base class for representing a public key of an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. By it's nature it's rather a structure, than a single value.
For example, if you work with RSA algorithm, then you can cast your public key to
RSAPublicKey and then access modulus and exponent.
if (pubKey instanceof RSAPublicKey) {
    RSAPublicKey rsaPubKey = (RSAPublicKey)pubKey;
    BigInteger modulus = rsaPubKey.getModulus();
    BigInteger exponent = rsaPubKey.getPublicExponent();
    System.out.println(""Modulus "" + modulus.toString());
    System.out.println(""Exponent "" + exponent.toString());
}

For elliptic curve cryptography the key consist of two values - parameters of an elliptic curve affineX and affineY
if (pubKey instanceof ECPublicKey) {
    ECPublicKey ecPubKey = (ECPublicKey)pubKey;
    ECPoint point = ecPubKey.getW();
    BigInteger affineX = point.getAffineX();
    BigInteger affineY = point.getAffineY();
    System.out.println(""Affine X "" + affineX.toString());
    System.out.println(""Affine Y "" + affineY.toString());
}

The same way internal structure of PrivateKey can be accessed.

You can even cross wires when loading the serialized keys and it just works. Below, the compressed key was loaded from a non-compressed serialization (and vice-versa):

//   so so there's a compress/uncompressed mismatch

// This should be `p1`
publicKey5.Load(StringSource(p2, true).Ref());
// This should be `p2`
publicKey6.Load(StringSource(p1, true).Ref());

// Get the public elemnts of the loaded keys
const ECP::Point& y5 = publicKey5.GetPublicElement();
const Integer& y5_x = y5.x;
const Integer& y5_y = y5.y;

Unfortunately, I'm stuck now that I have to implement the concept of zero, i.e., the point of the elliptic curve E crossing the line through P and -P, where P = (x,y) and -P = (x,-y). So, my question could be rephrased as ""how do I implement a point at infinity?""

I can create a private key explicitly
openssl ecparam -name secp521r1 -genkey -param_enc explicit -out private.key
openssl req -new -sha256 -nodes -key private.key -out sslcert.csr -config san.cnf

or I can create a private key with the request
openssl ecparam -name secp521r1 > ec.file
openssl req -new -sha256 -nodes -newkey ec:ec.file -keyout private.key -out sslcert.csr -config san.cnf

Both of these methods seem to create valid CSR files (I have tested them here).
My question is whether one of the methods above is better/safer? I noticed that the private key file generated by the first method is larger, and so is the CSR file.
For example, when I inspect the CSR using openssl req -noout -text -in sslcert.csr, the CSR generated by the first method contains much more detailed information about the key, with a section for pub, Prime, A, B, Generator, Order, Cofactor, Seed, but there is no mention of secp521r1.
However, the CSR generated by the second method contains only pub and a ASN1 OID: secp521r1. Are these differences important if I'm creating certificates for HTTPS use?
Many thanks!

These are called ""domain parameters"". They explicitly list the modulus, the coefficients, the generator, the public point, etc.

A name like ASN1 OID: secp521r1 is called a ""named curve"".
The IETF's PKIX and TLS working group say domain parameters and named curves are not the same thing. The PKIX group is responsible for the internet's PKI and certificates. There have been several discussions about this on the TLS working group mailing lists.
If you don't use a named curve, then your clients and servers will fail to connect to one another even the the domain parameters and named curves are equivalent. You will get errors similar to ""no shared cipher suites"" which will result in a TLS alert.
Here are the errors you get when using s_client and s_server during testing if you mix and match domain parameters with named curves:
Client (s_client):

For interoperability you should always explicitly set named_curve. Also see Elliptic Curve Cryptography | Named Curves on the OpenSSL wiki.


Both of these methods seem to create valid CSR files (I have tested them here).

They kind of do, but they don't inter-operate well if they are mixed/matched.


For modern compatibility, I've gone with EC (secp521r1) certificates...

I have not surveyed it recently, but secp256r1 is (was?) the most popular one. That may have changed but I don't recall reading it anywhere. Maybe a scan of the Alexis top 1 Million will give you an idea or answer.
The 2016 paper TLS in the wild: An Internet-wide analysis of TLS-based protocols for electronic communication says:

Looking at the elliptic curves that are used in ECDHE key exchanges
  reveals that  97.2% of connections use the secp256r1 curve, followed
  by 2% using secp384r1 and 0.78% using sect571r1.

WHAT HAS TO BE ACHIEVED

Generate SECP256K1 key pair
Use public key for account creation on a blockchain
Store private key to Key Vault and use it for signing purposes

ATTEMPT #1 - GENERATE OUTSIDE KEY VAULT AND IMPORT
I have generated SECP256K1 key pair outside Key Vault. As a result I have private key and public key available as strings.
My idea was to import the private key to Key Vault with help of Azure SDK for.NET wia following piece of code (ECParameters used are from Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault.WebKey.ECParameters namespace):
  //this part of code is taken from https://www.scottbrady91.com/C-Sharp/JWT-Signing-using-ECDSA-in-dotnet-Core
  var privateKeyBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(privateKey);
  var privateKeyInt =
    new Org.BouncyCastle.Math.BigInteger(+1, privateKeyBytes);
  var parameters = SecNamedCurves.GetByName(""secp256k1"");
  var ecPoint = parameters.G.Multiply(privateKeyInt);
  var privateKeyX = ecPoint.Normalize().XCoord.ToBigInteger()
    .ToByteArrayUnsigned();
  var privateKeyY = ecPoint.Normalize().YCoord.ToBigInteger()
    .ToByteArrayUnsigned();

  //the following part is my code
  var ecParameters = new ECParameters();
  ecParameters.Curve = ""P-256K"";
  ecParameters.X = privateKeyX;
  ecParameters.Y = privateKeyY;
  ecParameters.D = privateKeyBytes;

  var key = new JsonWebKey(ecParameters);
  JsonWebKeyVerifier.Options options =
    JsonWebKeyVerifier.Options.DenyIncompatibleOperations
    | JsonWebKeyVerifier.Options.DenyExtraneousFields;
  string error = (string) null;

  JsonWebKeyVerifier.VerifyByKeyType(key, options, ref error);

  await client.ImportKeyWithHttpMessagesAsync(vaultBaseUri, name, key);

The resulting key for import looks like this (copied from Visual Studio variable view, maybe it's shortened):
  {
    ""kty"": ""EC"",
    ""crv"": ""P-256K"",
    ""x"": ""vSUHj6deEhPI6QeILgfgf2I7VTgmiDon_5nsss560OA"",

  }

ATTEMPT #2 - GENERATE WITHIN KEY VAULT AND EXPORT

Is it possible to import SECP256K1 key via Azure SDK for .NET? If yes, could you provide me a link to working example?
Am I doing something wrong/insufficent in my code during attempt to import the key to Key Vault?
Is it possible to export SECP256K1 public key from Key Vault?

This worked great! The application hits Github to check for updates and manages the SSL/TLS connection flawlessly. Elsewhere while using it, it attempts to access another website, https://themoose.co.uk, but fails with an SSL/TLS error. The only reasonable difference I could find between that site and Github was that it uses an ECC cert as opposed to Github's more traditional RSA cert.
I also saw these lines in WINE's console output:

When I run this (Max(100)) it tells me that max = 0. However I know there are #gen  = 1 and 2 at different places and therefore #gen > 0. I have having difficulty localizing max. It thinks of max outside the if and for statements as different than the max inside the for and if statements and thus is not updating max. I'm not sure how in magma CAS syntax I can correct for this. Can somebody help me understand Magma syntax with respect to this aspect? 
I tried putting local max; inside the loop and if statements but gave me syntax error.
","I don't know magma, but if it's anything like other procedural computer languages then it looks like you have a simple bug in your code. the lines:
    if max eq #gen then
        max := #gen;
    end if;

should be changed to
    if #gen > max then
        max := #gen;
    end if;

using whatever the the correct syntax is for the greater-than operator.

"30733932","Recovering an ECPublicKey from JavaCard to Java","I am trying to implement ECDH between a terminal (simulated by my computer) and a smart card (Java Card).
I fixed the elliptic curve that I want to use, and on the card side I have the following code to run the first part of the protocol :
        ECPublicKey pubKey = (ECPublicKey) KeyBuilder.buildKey(
            KeyBuilder.TYPE_EC_FP_PUBLIC, (short) 0x0100, false);
        pubKey.setFieldFP(p, (short) 0x0001, (short) 0x0020);
        pubKey.setA(a, (short) 0x0001, (short) 0x0020);
        pubKey.setB(b, (short) 0x0000, (short) 0x0020);
        pubKey.setR(r, (short) 0x0001, (short) 0x0020);
        pubKey.setG(g, (short) 0x0000, (short) g.length);

        ECPrivateKey privKey = (ECPrivateKey) KeyBuilder.buildKey(
            KeyBuilder.TYPE_EC_FP_PRIVATE, (short) 0x0100, false);

        KeyPair keypair = new KeyPair(pubKey, privKey);
        keypair.genKeyPair();

        pubKey.getW(apduBuffer, (short) 0x0000);
        setOutgoingAndSend((short) 0x0000, (short) 0x0041);

So I create a KeyPair for ECDH and I send the public one to my terminal.
My problem is the following : I am not able to reconstruct an ECPublicKey given the response APDU I get...
I did not find any way to do this in Java (even using external library as Bouncy Castle).
Could someone help me ? Thank you in advance.
","The public key returned in JavaCard is formatted as follows: 04 x y. In the terminal side, first you must extract x and y coordinates. Then,

KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""ECDSA"", ""BC""); 
ECPoint point = new ECPoint(x, y);
ECParameterSpec domainparameters = new ECParameterSpec(...); // initialize your domain parameters
ECPublicKeySpec spec = new ECPublicKeySpec(point, domainparameters);
ECPublicKey publickey = (ECPublicKey)kf.generatePublic(spec);

","Public key encryption is not recommended to use for encryption. The general practice is hybrid-encryption where a block cipher key is exchanged then symmetric encryption is performed.
After the key exchange the most common issues Authentication and Integrity. The modern practice is using an authenticated encryption mode as AES-GCM. GCM mode gives you authentication and integrity. You can see an implementation here

","AndroidKeyStore does not currently support encryption or decryption with EC keys, only with RSA keys.
To use EC keys for encryption, you need to either use ECDH plus a key derivation function (KDF) to compute a shared symmetric key which you can use for your data, or to use ECIES which does that internally.  But AndroidKeyStore doesn't support either mode of operation as of Android 10.  Maybe in Android 11.
For now, you can either use RSA with an appropriate padding mode (OAEP recommended) to encrypt your symmetric key, or you can use the native Java cryto provider.  This, unfortunately, will not use secure hardware to generate, store or use the key, and will instead do all of these things in your app's process space.  There's an example here.
(For what it's worth, I'm the Google engineer who owns AndroidKeyStore.  I've been planning to add ECDH support for a few years now, but it's always been pre-empted by other features that were considered higher priority.  I will get to it, though.)

","The problem is that where blocks scope over function guards, so it's not possible to create a separate where for each guarded statement.  When ghc encounters the where on line 59, it automatically ends the function declaration and expects a new declaration to follow, which makes the | an error because it's not a valid declaration.  It works with a let-expression because let and where are different parts of the language.  The Haskell Wiki has more information on this topic.

The problem is within the ecc_double_add function, using the mpz_t *tx and mpz_t *ty variable. When I am running the code I get a seg fault.
Therefore, I initialized the variables outside the function (commented out in main function). As soon I do it that way, it works. I am confused and don't know why I am receiving the seg fault. My C knowledge is not that good and I am trying to get better. 
I appreciate any help :)
*Edit:
I am using the GNU MP Library for this task, which is here: https://gmplib.org/
","I had been tinkering around and I found out that the gmp_printf function is causing the problem. As soon I am removing it from the for loop the code is working. I replaced it with printf and gmp_printf without a parameter and the code started to work. 
I am not sure why gmp_printf is making problems but I found this: https://gmplib.org/list-archives/gmp-bugs/2011-July/002304.html
I replaced the gmp_printf with 
printf(""Result: %s\n"", mpz_get_str(NULL, 16, *rx));

It's not a nice solution but for testing should be enough.

"46730753","How to change the key length of ECDSA?","Recently, I was trying to do something with the code of ECDSA.  I want to change the key length of it but in vain. I checked the internet and found some source code of ECDSA, but somehow it only allows 32 bytes.
For example, I found this:
var crypto = require(""crypto"");
var eccrypto = require(""eccrypto"");     

// A new random 32-byte private key.
var privateKey = crypto.randomBytes(32);

// Corresponding uncompressed (65-byte) public key.
var publicKey = eccrypto.getPublic(privateKey);

var str = ""message to sign"";

// Always hash you message to sign!    
var msg = crypto.createHash(""sha256"").update(str).digest();

eccrypto.sign(privateKey, msg).then(function(sig) {
   console.log(""Signature in DER format:"", sig);
   eccrypto.verify(publicKey, msg, sig).then(function() {    
      console.log(""Signature is OK"");
   }).catch(function() {    
      console.log(""Signature is BAD"");
   });
});

from this website. I tried to change the privateKey from 32 bytes to 16 bytes and other values. It ended up giving me errors.
Recently I discovered that to have different key length you need different curves. Does anybody know how to change the curve in the above code? If not, would someone provide source code that can use different key lengths of ECDSA?
(I'm quite new to ECC, so if I used wrong terms or I completely misunderstood the concept of it, please forgive).
","According to https://github.com/bitchan/eccrypto#implementation-details (which looks like the right library for your code) the library only supports the secp256k1 curve.
Most other libraries, if given no context other than the curve being a 256-bit curvespace, will assume it is secp256r1 (r instead of k), meaning that the library you chose doesn't interoperate with a lot of libraries.  (For example, Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 cannot do secp256k1 using the OS-provided cryptographic libraries)
So for ""how do I use a different sized key with this library?"" the answer is ""you can't, sorry"".  And for ""what library can I use, then?"" the answer is ""sorry, that's outside the scope of StackOverflow"".

The difference is in how the public and private keys are represented. 
The signature of an ECPrivateKey Record is: 
    ECPrivateKey'{ version, privateKey, parameters, publicKey}
In Erlang 18, both values are represented at plain binaries, in 17, the private key is a list and the public key is part of a tuple, {0, binary}. 
So in order to build the pem file correctly, the entity representation has to change.
{public, private} = :crypto.generate_key(:ecdh, :secp256k1)
entity = {:ECPrivateKey,

  private,

  public}      

Using the new representation of the record will solve the problem.

"41755569","Derived certificate from private key in iOS(Objective-C)","I am able to generate ECC key pair on iOS (Objective-C).
Now I want to derive certificate from the generated private key?
In android normally we do:

initialize KeyStore, KeyPairGenerator
generate key pair with identifier (later retrieve with the identifier)
retrieve entry from keystore by identifier KeyStore.Entry entry = ks.getEntry(identifier, null);
get private key by calling ((KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry) entry).getPrivateKey()
get certificate by calling ks.getCertificate(identifier)
derived public key from certificate by calling ks.getCertificate(keyHandle).getPublicKey()

How can I export certificate in iOS?

","There are two problems that I see with your code, although I don't know if this is causing your error:

Again, as stated in my comment, don't compare Strings using ==. Use the equals(...) or the equalsIgnoreCase(...) method instead. Understand that == checks if the two objects are the same which is not what you're interested in. The methods on the other hand check if the two Strings have the same characters in the same order, and that's what matters here.  
The same goes for BigIntegers. You should either use the equals(...) method or the compareTo(...) method if you want to test for equality/inequality or > or <.
It's a truism that is usually correct, that all reference types should be checked for equality using their equals(...) method. This is not so for primitives which have no methods. Also enums can be tested for equality via == and != although equals(...) will work fine for them.


As an aside, you will want to learn and use Java naming conventions. Variable names should all begin with a lower letter while class names with an upper case letter. Also you should avoid using trivial variable names such as b or s unless they are being used for trivial purposes such as the index of a for loop. Instead use names that have some meaning so that your code becomes self-commenting. 
Following these suggestions as well as following good code formatting practices will allow others (such as us!) to better understand your code, and more importantly, will allow your future self to better understand just what you were thinking 6 months ago when you wrote the code.

However it still fails to validate the signature. Hope it makes it a bit clearer.
","part of your problem is that g is actually not a number but a point
this is a rough translation of what you wrote:
g = 55066263022277343669578718895168534326250603453777594175500187360389116729240

k = <random number>
r = k*g%p%n
e = sha(m)

ki = k^-1%n
pr = privateKey*r
ki*e
s = ki%n

i wrote an implmentation of this however over the last few weeks something like this:

r = g * k
s = ((privateKey * r.x + e) * (k^-1%n)) % n

it might help you to understand how the point multiplication works check out these links:
https://github.com/Azero123/simple-js-ec-math
https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-js-ec-math
https://eng.paxos.com/blockchain-101-foundational-math

","Seems you are making some wrong assumptions and you may want to reconsider / rethink your approach. 

to get a new encrypted image. Then calculate the(PSNR)peak signal-to-noise ratio between theme

BMP image format consists of more than just pixels. As already commented, there are header metadata  (size, depth, ,...) which, if you encrypt the whole file, won't make sense anymore (it won't be any bmp) . I'd say you can create a new image and process a pixel by pixel on the image level, not just encrypting an input file.  Example:
https://www.dyclassroom.com/image-processing-project/how-to-get-and-set-pixel-value-in-java
int p = img.getRGB(x,y);


So I researched other options and found ECIES.

ECIES is a hybrid scheme, you may have a look at following answer for ECIES encryption https://gist.github.com/amrishodiq/9821413
 . The output will need to contain more/other information than just pixels and it is definitely not any BMP you can just open and compare.  
Hybrid encryption scheme assumes that data are encrypted by a symmetric cipher (I am not sure which is used by BC in this case, if someone knows, please comment), where the encryption key is derived using ECC. 
So at the end you'd be comparing pixels encrypted by an underlying symmetric algorithm (e. g. aes256-cbc), where it is designed to provide output indistinguishable from random output. 

have to encrypt a bmp image with ECC

If you would encrypt each pixel (lets assume you will represent every pixel as 16 bit rgb), the ECC output is much longer than the input data, so it's not easy to direcly map input values into output of the same dimension (size)

Unfortunately, while this algorithm is cited left right and center, the actual algorithm (and, dare I hope, its analysis) is not cited anywhere. Is there someone that could explain it to me, or at least give me a link on pseudocode/analysis?
Many thanks in advance!
","To multiply a number P by an n-bit scalar k, you can use doubling and addition according to the binary expansion of k.  Let's say that k=9.  In binary, that's 1001, and you can calculate 9P like this:
R=0
R=R*2+P  //the most significant '1' bit
R=R*2    //next bit is 0
R=R*2    //next bit is 0
R=R*2+P  //next bit is 1

The Strauss-Shamir trick is just calculating aP + bQ by doing the additions inside the chain instead of outside.   Let's say that, in binary, a=1001 and b=0011`. Then we just do this:
R=0
R=R*2+P   //bits from a,b = 1,0
R=R*2     //bits from a,b = 0,0
R=R*2+Q   //bits from a,b = 0,1
R=R*2+P+Q //bits from a,b = 1,1

If you precompute P+Q, then this doesn't take much longer than a single multiplication.

I know that .NET has support for public key encryption (RSACryptoServiceProvider), but the encrypted text gets so huge.
Would it work to instead  treat the private key as a public key?
Would Elliptic curve cryptography produce a smaller output?
","First of all, if you want to achieve confidentiality you should always encrypt with the public key, not the private key. RSA encryption is not defined for encryption with the private key, and the results may vary (especially the kind of padding that is applied).
For direct RSA encryption, the size of the encrypted message is identical to the modulus. Now the modulus should be at least 2048 bits by now, and your message is only about (27/3)*10=90 bits. So RSA would have a large overhead, independent on the key used. Using ECIES is therefore likely to give significant benefits.

and although I would like to add some functionalities to them, they work with actual int values for a,b and x,y.
However, my problem is when I try to use sympy and use 'symbols' for a,b and x,y.
Ideally, my goal is to computationally prove the associative property for 3 points on an elliptic curve, ie, (P+Q)+R = P+(Q+R).
Now, I am able to get a correct result for P+Q:
a,b = symbols('a b')
x1,y1 = symbols('x1 y1')
x2,y2 = symbols('x2 y2')
x3,y3 = symbols('x3 y3')

E = EllipticCurve(a,b)
P = Point(E,x1,y1)
Q = Point(E,x2,y2)
R = Point(E,x3,y3)

P+Q

print(simplify((P+Q).x))

which outputs, correctly:

-x1 - x2 + (y1 - y2)**2/(x1 - x2)**2

Moreover, if I do this:
expr = (P+Q)+R
print(simplify(expr.x))

I get, also (I think) correctly:

x1 + x2 - x3 + (y1 + y3 - (y1 - y2)*(2*x1 + x2 - (y1 - y2)**2/(x1 - x2)**2)/(x1 - x2))**2/(x1 + x2 + x3 - (y1 - y2)**2/(x1 - x2)**2)**2 - (y1 - y2)**2/(x1 - x2)**2

However, if I do:
expr = (P+Q)+R
expr2 = P+(Q+R)

print(simplify((expr-expr2).x))

It takes forever, and if I try:
expr = (P+Q)+R
expr2 = P+(Q+R)

print((expr-expr2).x)

It also return an expression that seems reasonable and I think correct.
But I need to simplify it and to return 0 to prove that expr and expr2 are equal.
Any suggestions on what I am doing wrong ?

The keys have been written to the card by my test app. If I sign 32 bytes of data and pass the signature back to the card the Verify code successfully verifies the signature. If I sign 32 bytes in Bouncy Castle with the Private key and pass to the Verify on the Card it successfully verifies the signature. The bouncy castle Verify Code successfully verifies signatures created from the bouncy castle signing routine.
BUT if I take the returned signature from the Java Card and pass it to the C# bouncy castle code it FAILS to verify the signature. I have checked all input values and they are correct. My code is here (note I pass Public keys as 64 bytes and prepend them with 0x04)
public bool HashAndVerifyDSA(byte[] pb, byte[] inData, byte[] sig)

    byte[] pub = new byte[65];

I should note that the parameters specify the P-256 curve and are used successfully in the encrypted communication to the card. The Public key is successfully created.
I seem to have less hair now then I did two days ago. Any pointers would be welcome.

"13653771","Trying to reconcile elliptic curve error","I am trying to do the following:
I have a piece of software which is using ECC to generate a standard Rijndael key (NOT AES... There is a difference: AES only supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, while Rijndael  originally supported 160 and 224 bits.  This bit me at first when I was looking at the software.)  I have been able to determine that it does the following:
It has several modes, but in the weakest mode, it uses ECC secp160r1 to generate a 160 bit key (hence the Rijndael and NOT AES).  I have been able to take ""public"" values and use the private key in my own software, and, using openssl calls, have been able to generate the same keys and decrypt the data I need to decrypt.
In the best (strongest/hardest, what have you) mode, it pretty much does the same thing, however, it uses ECC sect571k1 to generate a key and takes only the first 32 bytes of the 72 it generates for a Rijndael 256 bit key (in this case, you could say AES256).
However, in another mode, it APPEARS to do the same thing, but when I attempt to do the same thing as I have done before, I DON'T get the same shared secret.
If you use the standard definitions for Alice and Bob:
da = Alice's secret key
db = Bob's secret key
Qa = Alice's public key
Qb = Bob's public key
S  = Shared secret

I Have:
daQb --> The public value sent from Alice.
db   --> My ""secret"" key.
Qb   --> My ""public"" key.
Sc   --> The ""correct"" shared secret as computed by above program

I have checked that my Qb and the daQb are on the sect283k1 curve.  If I use
sect283r1, things fail, and my points don't register on that curve using Openssl
EC_POINT, EC_KEY, EC_GROUP functions (I would post the code now, but I don't have
it in front of me.  As soon as I do, I'll try to post it here).  I have been able
to reproduce, as I said, two other modes, and it seems to work properly.  However,
in this mode, when I compute the key, I get Sw --> The ""wrong"" shared secret as computed
by MY program.
So, my question is this:  Do I have enough information to potentially determine if I may
be using the wrong db?  I don't think that I am, because in the other two cases, I can
get the db and it works fine.  Unfortunately, I don't have the source code for said program.  I am trying to create a tool that can work with the data generated by the original tool.
I thought of trying to invert Qb and multiply the data by daQb, but all that really does is
get me da, which, while interesting, doesn't lead me to a way I can use it on the shared secret I have to determine db, to check my work.
The other thing I thought of is that maybe a similar curve to sect283k1 was used, but NOT sect283k1 (i.e. maybe some different G?  I'm not sure if it is possible to use another generator on that curve, but I didn't think there was but 1 generator per curve, but maybe that is wrong, and maybe another generator would produce different results... i.e. the correct results).
At any rate, I've tried several things only to produce the same wrong key data using, presumably, the same data the other program is using.  Maybe someone with some far superior EC math knowledge (just about any would be better than my own, but I'm hoping for someone who can help me see what I'm missing) can show me a way I can reconcile what I get with what the other tool gets.
Unfortunately, I can stop just before the Rijndael key is set and see what it will be set to.  I can find that part of the key and see the original data that came from an ECDH_compute_key operation (which appears to essentially be an EC_POINT_mul between daQb and db (If I know enough about Diffie-Hellman key exchange... I've verified this much anyway using some openssl calls), and I know a few other things, but I can't locate the Bignum/EC code that would help me see what went into the operation.  So I'm looking for another way to skin the cat.
Thanks to anyone that can help.

-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

","Let me first briefly describe your target format. What you are seeking to obtain is a PEM encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo (SPKI) file. PEM encoding is essentially DER encoding (which is a binary format) and then base64 encoded with a header and footer. The SPKI structure is defined in RFC5280 (see section 4.1):
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.1
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
        algorithm            AlgorithmIdentifier,
        subjectPublicKey     BIT STRING  }

So the first chunk of bytes in the binary DER encoding consists of a header that identifies the algorithm being used (and part of that includes the curve). The last bytes are the raw public key (which is an encoded x and y co-ordinate on the curve).
Since your sample key is for the same curve as the key you want to create it will have the same AlgorithmIdentifier header bytes. Taking your mykey.pub file we can convert it to the binary DER format:
$ openssl ec -in mykey.pub -pubin -outform DER -out key.der

Lets look at the contents:
$ hexdump -C key.der
00000000  30 59 30 13 06 07 2a 86  48 ce 3d 02 01 06 08 2a  |0Y0...*.H.=....*|
00000010  86 48 ce 3d 03 01 07 03  42 00 04 4c 65 30 a3 03  |.H.=....B..Le0..|
00000020  44 7e a4 34 2e d1 e2 31  72 4f 63 e3 ac e6 95 dc  |D~.4...1rOc.....|
00000030  96 c6 02 44 f3 a2 dc 5e  8a d2 7e 24 d5 18 c9 ec  |...D...^..~$....|
00000040  f1 a9 ff d4 61 67 2d d7  4b 5c a7 d5 09 6e e2 1a  |....ag-.K\...n..|
00000050  02 0a 51 dc 73 da cf 5c  f9 f8 7d                 |..Q.s..\..}|
0000005b

You can see the first bytes of the public key that you printed out above starting at offset 0x1a (i.e. 26 bytes in): 04 4c 65 30 .... The raw public key data extends all the way the end of the file and is 65 bytes long. This consists of a leading 0x04 byte followed by 32 bytes of x co-ordinate and 32 bytes of y co-ordinate. The leading 0x04 tells us how the co-ordinate is represented. 0x04 means ""uncompressed"" - which is handy because that's the simplest for us to deal with. We will also use uncompressed format for our target key. Therefore we need to take the first 26 bytes of header plus the 0x04 byte (so 27 bytes in total) from our sample key:
$ head -c 27 key.der >key.head

And just to check we got what we were expecting:
$ hexdump -C key.head
00000000  30 59 30 13 06 07 2a 86  48 ce 3d 02 01 06 08 2a  |0Y0...*.H.=....*|
00000010  86 48 ce 3d 03 01 07 03  42 00 04                 |.H.=....B..|
0000001b

Now we create the x and y elements of our co-ordinate, which you already did:
$ echo -n ""GCl++lQHb7NKYU3jXpKVI/BYaTlALT5JFPdl3sbB9mY="" | base64 -d >key.x
$ echo -n ""ADRX25PBSlZJE79drET0ARtRqZAkUIMNt9aa2bbjBYY="" | base64 -d >key.y

And then put all the elements together:
cat key.head key.x key.y >keynew.der

We can convert the new key in DER format to PEM format:
$ openssl ec -in keynew.der -inform DER -pubin -out keynew.pem

Which gives us:
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

LT5JFPdl3sbB9mYANFfbk8FKVkkTv12sRPQBG1GpkCRQgw231prZtuMFhg==

And just to check it looks sane:
$ openssl ec -in keynew.pem -pubin -noout -text

The documentation states ""The example private key is represented as the unsigned scalar converted to bytes."" and has a value of:
pX/BvdXXUdpC79mW/jWi10Z6PJb5SBY2+aqkR/qYOjqgakKsqZFKnl0kz10Ve+BP
I may be reading the private key incorrectly? As the secret key I try and resolve does not match the expected value in the documentation.
There is little implementation detail online.
In terms of Bouncy Castle, how might the private key be read from a string and then used to produce the shared key?

MPI's a library and set of tools that enables you to run your code in different processes (though some versions of MPI used threads, this is not common).
Since processes do not share memory, anything you're doing with GMP in one process will not affect another.
Your only worry is that GMP is doing some kind of internal multithreading to speed things up (I don't think it does). If so, allocate fewer processes in MPI than you otherwise might or disable GMP's multithreading.

I am trying to generate a public and private keypair using elliptic curve diffie-hellman, I successfully generate a private key that is smaller than the order of the curve but when I calculate the public key by multiplying the base point by the private key I calculate a point that is not on the curve.
The code I am using to generate the keys looks like this:
Public Shared Function generate_Keys(ByVal Param As Domain_Parameters) As Keys
        Dim __PrivateKey As BigInteger
        Dim __PublicKey As ECPoint
        Dim d As BigInteger
        Dim rng As New RNGCryptoServiceProvider
        Dim bytes(Param.n.ToByteArray.Length) As Byte
        Do
            rng.GetBytes(bytes)
            d = New BigInteger(bytes)
            If d.Sign = -1 Then
                d = d * -1
            End If

I have a feeling that it is possibly the way I am generating a private key or that I am using the wrong operation when calculating G.d .
Any help would really be appreciated thanks.
===EDIT===
After spending some time check values I have found the problem to be caused by the scalar_mult function not returning the right value. Is this function written correctly because i am unsure I have tested it with values from a site and it has been adapted from the pseudocode on wikipedia. Is that the correct method for adding a point to itself x number of time?

","Yes, you can do so, assuming that you already have a generator point and the ability to perform scalar*point multiplication (by doing point addition in the correct succession). Use an LFSR or other means of generating a random scalar up to the order of the group and multiply the generator point by that scalar.

        val keySpec = java.security.spec.ECPublicKeySpec(ecPoint, params2)
        val factory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""ECDSA"")
        return factory.generatePublic(keySpec) as ECPublicKey

","Yes, this is possible with OpenSSL. OpenSSL provides the ability to override the default source of random numbers. To do this use the RAND_set_rand_method() function documented here:
https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/crypto/RAND_set_rand_method.html
This function takes as an argument a RAND_METHOD structure which contains function pointers to the implementations of the OpenSSL random capabilities. Replace the bytes element with your own implementation.
For example
RAND_METHOD myrand, *oldrand;

oldrand = RAND_get_rand_method();
myrand = *oldrand;
myrand.bytes = mybytes;
RAND_set_rand_method(myrand);

Where mybytes is defined like this:
static int mybytes(unsigned char *buf, int num)
{
    /* Replace with however you want the random function to work */
    memset(buf, 0, num);
    return 1;
}

OpenSSL's own ecdsatest code does exactly this. For example see:

","
but since traditional ECDH is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attack.

What others often do is to pair ECDH with a signature scheme. For example, TLS uses ECDH with a scheme like RSA or ECDSA.
I'm not saying you should do it; I'm only letting you know what others are doing.


it is not in the main stream so I need to patch it...

We will be adding HMQV and FHMQV at the next release. The next release will be happening in the next couple of months.


Is there anyone who knows how to apply this patch to crypto++ that has been installed from Ubuntu repository?

The easiest thing to do would be to probably be to build a new version of the library, and then install it into /usr/local. I presume you know how to download and patch. To build and install:
# Crypto++ build directory
...
make static dynamic cryptest.exe
sudo make install PREFIX=/usr/local


You might be able to patch Ubuntu version because FHMQV is mostly a header-only implementation. However, cryptest.exe will not have the validation stuff included. You really need to build the library for it.
Download the patch and perform the following. fhmqv.h is the ""meat and potatoes"" of the patch.
sudo cp fhmqv.h /usr/include/cryptopp

You also need to add the following to eccrypto.h. Start by opening the file with privileges (i.e., sudo emacs /usr/include/cryptopp/eccrypto.h).
Then, add this to the top of eccrypto.h:
#include ""fhmqv.h""

And add this to the bottom of eccrypto.h:
//! Fully Hashed Menezes-Qu-Vanstone in GF(p) with key validation,
/*! <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/408"">A Secure and Efficient Authenticated DiffieHellman Protocol</a>

struct FHMQV
{
    typedef FHMQV_Domain<DL_GroupParameters_EC<EC>, COFACTOR_OPTION, HASH> Domain;

"52031491","How to convert ECPrivateKey into ECPublicKey using FIPS BouncyCastle?","How to convert ECPrivateKey into ECPublicKey using FIPS BouncyCastle?
I use the following code (slightly simplified) to convert an ECPrivateKey into an ECPublicKey:
public static ECPublicKey getPublicKeyFromPrivateKey(ECPrivateKey privateKey) throws GeneralSecurityException {
    final KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""ECDSA"", new BouncyCastleProvider());
    final BCECPrivateKey bcecPrivateKey = (BCECPrivateKey) privateKey;
    final ECParameterSpec ecSpec = bcecPrivateKey.getParameters();
    final ECPoint q = ecSpec.getG().multiply(bcecPrivateKey.getD());
    final byte[] qBytes = q.getEncoded(false);
    final ECPoint point = ecSpec.getCurve().decodePoint(qBytes);
    final ECPublicKeySpec pubSpec = new ECPublicKeySpec(point, ecSpec);
    return (ECPublicKey) keyFactory.generatePublic(pubSpec);
}

This is working fine with non-FIPS BouncyCastle. Now, we have the requirement to do the same thing in a FIPS-compliant way. And here the problem is that classes like ECParameterSpec don't appear to exist in FIPS BouncyCastle 1.0.1. How can we do the same thing with FIPS BouncyCastle?

I know in scalar multiplication, the point is added those many numbers of times to get the result. I have a question that if the scalar multiplication ((f1 + f2) * P) would be equal to (f1 * P + f2 *P )? I have written the code in Jpair library but I am getting different points. Moreover, I get the same point when I use BigInt numbers.  Can someone tell me why am I getting two different points when doing scalar multiplication?

Definitely, I will get this error because value in pxaffine is not valid,,, now my question is why this command ""pxaffine := x/z^2 mod p;"" doesnot work?
","The lowercase name p is not being assigned a value anywhere in your code, so the following command does not produce an integer result (ie. it returns unevaluated),
x/z^2 mod p;

The following line of your code does not assign an integer to lowercase p. It doesn't even assign to uppercase P because it uses = rather than :=.
P = convert(""FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEFFFFFC2F"", decimal, hex);

Perhaps you intended it to be an actual assignment to lowercase p, ie,
p := convert(""FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEFFFFFC2F"", decimal, hex);

So now let's try the example, excluding the assignment to y which is not used anywhere else. Here's what I get (output is indented):
x := convert(""9BAE2D5BAC61E6EA5DE635BCA754B2564B7D78C45277CAD67E45C4CBBEA6E706"", decimal, hex);

I am reading data from a file and storing it in a variable and then performing some operations. All works smoothly except that I get 0 in temp1 when I use mod(X2,P). However if I put in values stored in X2(3.0323e+153) and P(1.1579e+77) on command window (mod( 3.0323e+153, 1.1579e+77)), I get the correct values. Can anyone please help me? Below is the part of script which is problematic.
P = hex2dec('FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEFFFFFC2F');
line = fread(fileID,[1,67],'*char');
while ~feof(fileID)
        PX = line(4:67);

        temp1= mod(X2 , P)
    end
    line = fread(fileID,[1,69],'*char');
end

","I think the problem lies with how you're initializing P. From the documentation for hex2dec (emphasis mine):

d = hex2dec('hex_value') converts hex_value to its floating-point integer representation. The argument hex_value is a hexadecimal integer stored as text. If the value of hex_value is greater than the hexadecimal equivalent of the value returned by flintmax, then hex2dec might not return an exact conversion.

And the value of flintmax is:
>> flintmax
ans =
     9.007199254740992e+15

Quite a bit smaller than your value for P. In fact, if we use num2hex to look at the two ways you initialize P, you can see a clear difference:
>> P = hex2dec('FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEFFFFFC2F');
>> num2hex(P)
ans =
4ff0000000000000
>> num2hex(1.1579e+77)
ans =
4fefffda293c30de

As it turns out, the inexact conversion done by hex2dec results in a number that evenly divides into 3.0323e+153, thus giving you a remainder of 0:
>> mod(3.0323e+153, P)
ans =
     0
>> mod(3.0323e+153, 1.1579e+77)
ans =
     8.795697942083107e+76

It results in:

ERROR: E0245 a nonstatic member reference must be relative to a

","in

ECP::Point& result = ECP::Add(Basepoint, point);

you call ECP::Add as a static member of ECP, the error indicates there is no static Add , you need to apply it to an instance of ECP
When I look at the documentation I only see

const Point & Add (const Point &P, const Point &Q) const

which is not static
Also 

const ECP::Point& ECP::Add(&Basepoint, &point);
const int result = ECP::Point ECP::Add(&Basepoint, &point);

are an invalid forms. 
Even having just ECP::Add(&Basepoint, &point); is also wrong because the operation is not static and because the arguments are pointers to Point incompatible with the operation parameters. Probably you have to look at what a reference is in C++ documentation/tutorial
A valid code can be 
ECP ecp;
Point basepoint;
Point point;

// set ecp, basepoint and point to be the ones you want

const Point & r1 = ecp.Add(basepoint, point); // do not copy the result

","Now,I'am going to answer my own question since I have found the debug in my code at the end. I tested all of the potential errors and finally discovered that the return string of function 'BN_bn2dec()' must be free by 'OPENSSL_free()', otherwise it will lead to segmentation fault(core dumped) after about 2*10^8 loops. Here is the explanation of the documentation:
    BN_bn2hex() and BN_bn2dec() return printable strings containing the
    hexadecimal and decimal encoding of a respectively. For negative
    numbers, the string is prefaced with a leading '-'. The string must be
    freed later using OPENSSL_free().

I used GDB debugger to locate the error. GDB is really a useful tool to debug codes.

","First, this is all a pursuit of nondomesticated migratory waterfowl, because OpenSSL does have secp192r1 builtin, under its original/earlier X9.62 name prime192v1. To see for yourself:
openssl ecparam -name prime192v1 -param_enc explicit -noout -text 

Second, the code you posted is correct (though silly, because secp224r1 aka P-224 is also builtin) and works fine. The code you are running is apparently different, but since you don't let us see it, there is no way to try to figure out what is wrong with it (beyond being unnecessary).

However when during the generation of a keypair, the following error is sometimes thrown ""java.lang.ArithmeticException: BigInteger not invertible"". The error is not thrown every time, but rather occurs around 50% of the generations. If the key generation is successful, it seems however not to generate correct keypairs. This is since I´ve tried in those successful cases to use the generated public key to create a Bounty castle representation of the public key, which then fails and signals that the public key is an incorrect point.
I've tried to debug the code further, but as I lack the source files of the internals of javacard, I've not been able to able to track the error further than that it's thrown in the AsymmetricCipherKeyPairGenerator generateKeyPair function.
I'm completely confused as to what I've done incorrectly, and all my attempts to solve the issue have failed. If anyone can spot what I'm doing wrong I would be very thankful!

"58562804","Recent Java upgrade causes TLS handshake failure with elliptic curve server certificate?","On October 19th, I upgraded to OpenJDK Java 1.8.0_232 and my Java processes started failing to connect to a service fronted by stunnel using an EC server certificate. I have an EC client certificate that I would present to the server if the initial handshake would succeed, but it's not getting that far.
I was unable to obtain the version number of the previous version of Java that was running -- I had a long-running process on the client that was able to connect to the service successfully. Java has been upgraded but that client hadn't been restarted since the upgrade. I restarted the client and it, too, began to fail.
I'm about to start reading the announcement to see if there is anything in there that would suggest a ""fix"" to something, but I believe I have everything configured correctly on both client and server. My current thinking is that this is a bug in the JVM.
Using ssltest, I have been able to confirm that I can handshake with the server using multiple cipher suites when providing the correct client certificate, as long as I use Java 1.8.0_181 or Java 11.0.3 (these are the two versions I happened to have laying around on my laptop for testing). Using the same files, command-line, etc. fails when using Java 1.8.0_232.
Has anyone seen anything like this?
UPDATE
I have downloaded x86-64 OpenJDK versions 8u222 and 8u232 from here and I can confirm that version 8u222 will connect and 8u232 will not connect.
UPDATE
Downgrading to the previous version of OpenJDK has solved my problem for the time being. I'm using Debian Stretch, and I was able to downgrade with this command:
$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk-headless=8u222-b10-1~deb9u1 openjdk-8-jre-headless=8u222-b10-1~deb9u1

Note that I only have the ""headless"" packages installed, so I only downgraded the ""headless"" packages.
UPDATE
I can confirm that the client certificate is a red herring, here. I relaxed the requirements on my server to not require the client certificate and the initial TLS handshake still fails. I'm trying to narrow this down to the simplest test case I can get.
UPDATE
Still trying to diagnose the problem, here. I have a test server where I can launch it under various configurations and see what happens. I have determined that while Java 8u222 supports the secp256k1 curve, Java 8u232 does not, and I get the handshake failure.
","The secp256k1 curve has been disabled with jdk 8u232 (see https://java.com/en/download/faq/release_changes.xml). It can be re-enabled with the java system property jdk.tls.namedGroups.
The example on the faq lists a few other Obsolete NIST EC Curves that are disabled as well. The curves listed there are sect283k1, sect283r1, sect409k1, sect409r1, sect571k1, sect571r1 and secp256k1. The system property jdk.tls.namedGroups takes a comma separated list of those names.

"52782146","How to specify conditions within Julia's composite types?","I am trying to create a composite type in Julia representing points on an elliptic curve.
Point are valid if satisfying y^2 == x^3 + a*x + b OR both x and y are equal to nothing. Note that the later case represents point at infinity.
I have come up with the below code but can't figure out how to account for point at infinity.

Is there a way to handle different exceptions in struct?
Can exception simply return a valid type instead of an error? e.g. if x == nothing && y == nothing then Point(nothing,nothing,a,b)


IntOrNothing = Union{Int,Nothing}
struct Point
    x::IntOrNothing
    y::IntOrNothing
    a::Int
    b::Int
    Point(x,y,a,b) = x == nothing || y == nothing || y^2 != x^3 + a*x + b ? error(""Point is not on curve"") : new(x,y,a,b)
end


","I would define two inner constructors for Point like this:
IntOrNothing = Union{Int,Nothing}
struct Point
    x::IntOrNothing
    y::IntOrNothing
    a::Int
    b::Int
    Point(x::Nothing,y::Nothing,a,b) = new(x,y,a,b)
    Point(x,y,a,b) = y^2 != x^3 + a*x + b ? error(""Point is not on curve"") : new(x,y,a,b)
end

as this would be most readable in my opinion.
Note that you will get MethodError if you call Point(nothing,2,1,3) but I guess from your code you do not care about the type of exception thrown as long as it is thrown on invalid data.
Does it solve your problem?

","I don't know anything about elliptic curves, so this might not be helpful. I had a quick look through the help.
If you have the name of the elliptic curve as in ""11a1"", then you can get the conductor with ellconvertname(""11a1"") which returns [11, 0, 1]. The conductor is just the first element: 11.
Otherwise there is a method ellglobalred that given an elliptic curve structure will return amongst other things the arithmetic conductor. (I'm not sure if that is the same thing, but in this case the first element contains 11).
And I also noticed that after calling ellglobalred, the information including conductor gets stored back into the elliptic curve structure. You can then extract this using indexes. For example E=ellinit(""11a1""); ellglobalred(E); E[16][6][1]

1. giving an elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
2. the user will input a, b and two points that exactly on the curve.

To put it simply, what I really need to do is make a secant line of the graph with the two points P and Q and try to check that if there is any point of intersection existing. If it exists, get the x and y of this point. I'm so struggled to solve this problem. Could someone give me some hints?
","

I'd homogenize this to x^3 + axz^2 + bz^3 - y^2z = 0 and points P = [Px : Py : Pz] and Q = [Qx : Qy : Qz]. Then any point R = λP + μQ with (λ, μ) ≠ (0, 0) lies on the line spanned by P and Q. If you wanted to avoid homogenizations, you'd require λ+μ=1 but that usually leads to divisions I'd rather avoid until the very end.
Plug the resulting coordinates of R into the homogenized equation of the elliptic curve, and you obtain a homogeneous cubic equation in λ and μ, i.e. something like
αλ³ + βλ²μ + γλμ² + δμ³ = 0

with the α, β, γ and δ depending on your a, b, P, Q. For μ=0 you get a coordinate vector which is a multiple of P, and as homogeneous coordinates identify multiples, you get point P itself, which lies on the curve. So μ=0 must satisfy the equation, hence you know α=0 even before you compute it. Likewise λ=0 represents Q so δ=0 if that point lies on the curve. You are left with
(βλ + γμ)λμ = 0

The trailing two factors encode the two known intersections I just mentioned. The parenthesis is the third intersection, the one you need. Now simply pick λ=γ and μ=−β to obtain a simple expression for the third point of intersection.
If you want to dehomogenize at the end, simply divide the first two coordinates of the resulting homogeneous coordinate vector by the third.
If I didn't mess up my sympy computation, you have
β = 3*Px^2*Qx + 2*Px*Pz*Qz*a - Py^2*Qz - 2*Py*Pz*Qy + Pz^2*Qx*a + 3*Pz^2*Qz*b
γ = 3*Px*Qx^2 + 2*Pz*Qx*Qz*a - Pz*Qy^2 - 2*Py*Qy*Qz + Px*Qz^2*a + 3*Pz*Qz^2*b

Which is expectedly very symmetric in P and Q. So essentially you just need a single function, and then you get β=f(P,Q) and γ=f(Q,P).
In C++ and with the whole homogenization / dehomogenization in place:
inline double f(double Px, double Py, double Qx, double Qy, double a, double b) {
  return 3*Px*Px*Qx + 2*Px*a - Py*Py - 2*Py*Qy + Qx*a + 3*b;
}

std::pair<double, double> third_intersection(double Px, double Py, double Qx, double Qy, double a, double b) {
  double beta = f(Px, Py, Qx, Qy, a, b);
  double gamma = f(Qx, Qy, Px, Py, a, b);
  double denominator = gamma - beta;  // Might be zero if line PQ is an asymptote!
  double x = (gamma*Px - beta*Qx) / denominator;
  double y = (gamma*Py - beta*Qy) / denominator;
  return std::make_pair(x, y);

const lambda = (yq - yp) / (xq - xp)

do 
const numer = yq - yp
const denom = (xq - xp) ** (p - bi2)
const lambda = (numer * denom) % p

though I would think it would much clearer and less error prone to simply have a modular inverse function instead of computing Xp-2 everywhere you need it.

"56060327","Elliptic Curve in Swift signing and verifying results in error -9809","I'm writing this question because I've hit a dead end about the next issue.
I'm attempting to sign a chunk of data with a private key and then verify that data with a public key, but when i perform SecKeyRawVerify, it returns an error code of -9809, which is described by Apple as ""An underlying cryptographic error was encountered."", which isn't helpful at all.
I think the main issue is in my verifying code, which somehow doesn't work properly. Maybe I'm mistaken, though.
The minimum iOS version target is iOS10, if that helps. I think on iOS10 Apple did various changes on the security framework, but I'm not 100% sure.
Beware, the code is pretty long (sorry about that).

print(ECM(int(input())))

This code gets a composite number as input, and print two nontrivial divisors.
The code runs well for most of the inputs. Problem is, it's too slow...
I tested this code for some numbers between 60~120 bit integers(such as 2^101-1, 10^30-33, etc.), and what I encountered was it is even slower than roughly made Pollard's p-1 test like this:
def Pollard_pminus1(n):
    if '0' not in bin(n)[3:]: base = 3
    else: base = 2
    if n % base == 0: return base, n//base

    b = base; exp = 1
    while True:
        b = pow(b,exp,n)
        d = gcd(b-1,n)
        if d!=1: break
        exp += 1
    if d!=n: return d, n//d

And for inputs of roughly 50 digits(according to Wikipedia, this range should be the real playground for ECM...), this program is halted even for a day.
Can I improve the performance of this code? Is it worthy to optimize the boundary of the value k, or should I fix large part of this algorithm?
Thanks for your help, and sorry for poor language(if something wrong);;

"50392933","Costs of a Program (Point addition - doubling formulas)","I am currently working on the addition formulas in the Bitcoin protocol one can find on the Github webpage https://github.com/vbuterin/pybitcointools/blob/aeb0a2bbb8bbfe421432d776c649650eaeb882a5/bitcoin/main.py. I want to compare its performance to the formulas in the paper ''Complete addition formulas for prime order elliptic curves''. Therefore I need to count the number of point additions, squarings, multiplications and the number of integer operations. (In the spirit of [http://hyperelliptic.org/EFD/g1p/auto-shortw-jacobian-0.html][2]).
Unfortunately I am not a very good and experienced programer, since my background is a master of mathematics, with little programming experience.
The code is
def jacobian_add(p, q):
    if not p[1]:
        return q
    if not q[1]:
        return p
    U1 = (p[0] * q[2] ** 2) % P
    U2 = (q[0] * p[2] ** 2) % P
    S1 = (p[1] * q[2] ** 3) % P
    S2 = (q[1] * p[2] ** 3) % P
    if U1 == U2:
        if S1 != S2:
            return (0, 0, 1)
        return jacobian_double(p)
    H = U2 - U1
    R = S2 - S1
    H2 = (H * H) % P
    H3 = (H * H2) % P
    U1H2 = (U1 * H2) % P
    nx = (R ** 2 - H3 - 2 * U1H2) % P
    ny = (R * (U1H2 - nx) - S1 * H3) % P
    nz = (H * p[2] * q[2]) % P
    return (nx, ny, nz)

My question is: when I now cound the number of squarings of a point, does the computer safe the value for q2:= q[2]**2 when I compute q[2]**2 so that computing q[2]**3 only costs the multiplication of q2 with q[2], or did he 'forget' this value and needs to calculate it again?
Then it would be more efficient to define beforehand the square of p[2] and q[2] so that the program can read out the pre-defined values without the need to calculate it two times, no?
And is H*H the cost of a point squaring or point multiplication?

Usually this jacobian point addition is of a cost of: 4S (point squarings)+ 12M (point multiplications) + 6a (point additions) + 1*2 (multiplication by 2).

And indeed, going on OID ref Chromium's identifier seems good.
Firefox's OID seems to belong to another group entirely and I cannot even find it.
The thing is, a different OID makes various imports crash. A key exported this way from Firefox cannot be imported into OpenSSL or even Chromium without being altered first.
Thus,

What is this ID?
Why does Firefox use it instead of the more ""standard"" one used by Chromium?
Speaking of standards, is there anywhere this export format is defined in the W3C Recommandation or a related RFC?


Here's a snippet to quickly generate an exported EC public key:


(async () => {
  const subtle = crypto.subtle
  const eckp = await subtle.generateKey({
    name: 'ECDSA',
    namedCurve: 'P-256'
  }, true, ['sign', 'verify'])

  const exportedPubK = new Uint8Array(await subtle.exportKey('spki', eckp.publicKey))
  console.log(exportedPubK.length) // 88 for the weird OID, 91 otherwise.
  console.log(`[${exportedPubK.join(', ')}]`)
})();



","The cause is a Firefox-bug, see Bug 1410403 and Bug 1514032, respectively. 
The correct OID for a public ECDSA (or ECDH) key is 1.2.840.10045.2.1 according to RFC 5480, section 2.1.1. OID 1.3.132.112 is not defined (the similar OID 1.3.132.1.12 is restricted to ECDH, see also RFC 5480, section 2.1.2 and W3C Recommendation, section B).

"58167034","ECDiffieHellman - mbedTLS vs C#","I need to use elliptic curve Diffie Hellman between a ARM cortex M3 and the PC.
On the ARM, I use mbed TLS. On the PC side I want to us C# and the ECDiffieHellman(Cng) class.
I can do the ECDH on ARM vs ARM, but I do have trouble when I try to replace one side with the PC.

Problem was the key exchange.
I found out, that the key is exported by mbed TLS as <LEN><0x04><X><Y>.

Thus, In C# I am importing the public key using
private static EC
DiffieHellmanPublicKey ToPublicKey(byte[] publicKey)
{
    var keyLength = 32;

    if (publicKey[0] != (2 + 2 * keyLength) - 1)
        throw new ArgumentException(""Invalid key length"", nameof(publicKey));
    if (publicKey[1] != 0x04)
        throw new ArgumentException(""Invalid key format"", nameof(publicKey));

    var parameters = new ECParameters()
    {
        Curve = ECCurve.NamedCurves.brainpoolP256r1,
        Q = new ECPoint()
        {
            X = publicKey.Skip(2).Take(keyLength).ToArray(),
            Y = publicKey.Skip(2 + keyLength).Take(keyLength).ToArray()
        }
    };

    using (var tmp = ECDiffieHellman.Create(parameters))
    {
        return tmp.PublicKey;
    }
}


To generate the key I tried

var ecdh = new ECDiffieHellmanCng(ECCurve.NamedCurves.brainpoolP256r1);
ecdh.KeyDerivationFunction = ECDiffieHellmanKeyDerivationFunction.Tls;
ecdh.Seed = new byte[32];
ecdh.Label = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(""ECDiffieHellman"");

new RNGCryptoServiceProvider().GetBytes(ecdh.Seed);

// ...

var sharedSecret = ecdh.DeriveKeyMaterial(peersPublicKey);

My problem is that the generated shared secret is of different length compared to the one generated by mbed TLS and does not match.
Did someone already solve this problem?
Thanks!
EDIT 1:
I forgot to mention, that I use bare ECDH on ARM. So I don't think there is any key derivation function executing. Is it sufficient to hash (SHA256) the result to match the C# side (when configuring SHA256 as KDF there)?
","I solved the problem. In short: just hash the ECDH result.

","Assuming you already know about ITU-T X.680-201508 (the ASN.1 language) and ITU-T X.690-201508 (the BER (and CER) and DER encodings for ASN.1 data), the main defining document for Elliptic Curve Keys and their representation is https://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf from the Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group (not the US Securites and Exchange Commission).
Section C.3 (Syntax for Elliptic Curve Public Keys) says that the general transport container for an EC public key is the X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure:
SubjectPublicKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
    algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier {{ECPKAlgorithms}} (WITH COMPONENTS
        {algorithm, parameters}) ,
    subjectPublicKey BIT STRING
}

The possible ""algorithms"" (which really means key encoding types) is the open-ended set
ECPKAlgorithms ALGORITHM ::= {
    ecPublicKeyType |
    ecPublicKeyTypeRestricted |
    ecPublicKeyTypeSupplemented |
    {OID ecdh PARMS ECDomainParameters {{SECGCurveNames}}} |
    {OID ecmqv PARMS ECDomainParameters {{SECGCurveNames}}},
    ...
}

ecPublicKeyType ALGORITHM ::= {
    OID id-ecPublicKey PARMS ECDomainParameters {{SECGCurveNames}}
}

...

ECDomainParameters came from C.2:
ECDomainParameters{ECDOMAIN:IOSet} ::= CHOICE {
    specified SpecifiedECDomain,
    named ECDOMAIN.&id({IOSet}),
    implicitCA NULL
}

C.3 mentions about halfway through

The elliptic curve public key (a value of type ECPoint that is an OCTET STRING) is mapped to a subjectPublicKey (a value encoded as type BIT STRING) as follows: The most significant bit of the value of the OCTET STRING becomes the most significant bit of the value of the BIT STRING and so on with consecutive bits until the least significant bit of the OCTET STRING becomes the least significant bit of the BIT STRING.

So we seek backwards and find

An elliptic curve point itself is represented by the following type
ECPoint ::= OCTET STRING

whose value is the octet string obtained from the conversion routines given in Section 2.3.3.

2.3.3 (Elliptic-Curve-Point-to-Octet-String Conversion) has a lot of words, but the best supported format is not using point compression (and P != the point at infinity)


If P = (xP , yP ) != O and point compression is not being used, proceed as follows:

3.1. Convert the field element xP to an octet string X of length (log2 q)/8 octets using the conversion routine specified in Section 2.3.5.
3.2. Convert the field element yP to an octet string Y of length (log2 q)/8 octets using the conversion routine specified in Section 2.3.5.
3.3. Output M = 0416 || X || Y .

2.3.5 is a whole lot of words for ""big endian byte order of a length long enough to hold all values in the field"" (aka ""leave in leading zeros"").
So now we party.
Given the FIPS 186-3 reference key on secp256r1 (d=70A12C2DB16845ED56FF68CFC21A472B3F04D7D6851BF6349F2D7D5B3452B38A),
Q is 
(8101ECE47464A6EAD70CF69A6E2BD3D88691A3262D22CBA4F7635EAFF26680A8, D8A12BA61D599235F67D9CB4D58F1783D3CA43E78F0A5ABAA624079936C0C3A9)
And the public key DER looks like
// SubjectPublicKeyInfo
30 XA
   // AlgorithmIdentifier
   30 XB
      // AlgorithmIdentifier.id (id-ecPublicKey (1.2.840.10045.2.1))
      06 07 2A 86 48 CE 3D 02 01
      // AlgorithmIdentifier.parameters, using the named curve id (1.2.840.10045.3.1.7)
      06 08 2A 86 48 CE 3D 03 01 07
   // SubjectPublicKeyInfo.subjectPublicKey
   03 XC 00
      // Uncompressed public key
      04
      // Q.X
      81 01 EC E4 74 64 A6 EA D7 0C F6 9A 6E 2B D3 D8
      86 91 A3 26 2D 22 CB A4 F7 63 5E AF F2 66 80 A8

      D3 CA 43 E7 8F 0A 5A BA A6 24 07 99 36 C0 C3 A9

Count up all the bytes for XA, XB, and XC:
XC = 32 (Q.X) + 32 (Q.Y) + 1 (0x04) + 1 (0x00 for the unused bits) = 66 = 0x42
XB = 19 = 0x13
XA is then 66 + 19 + 2 (tag bytes) + 2 (length bytes) = 89 = 0x59
(And, of course, if any of our length values exceeded 0x7F we would have had to encode them correctly)
So now we are left with

in stackoverflow and the Answer was to implement ECC without B**C.
So i searched about ECC and found:
Elliptic curve cryptography consists of three distinct
operations: 
1_ key generation:

we need a point G,also called as the generator point.
a large integer nB is kept as the Private Key.
and the point PB = nB * G is declared as public.
-map the plaintext message to a point on the elliptic curve(for that i get 
each pixele and multiplying it with G). 

2_ encryption:

the sender chooses a random positive integer k.
then uses the public key PB to generate the cipher point Cm that consists 
of two points.
Cm = [{k  G}, {Pm +(k  PB)}].

3_ decryption:
C2 – nB * C1 = {Pm + (k * PB)}{nB * (k * G)}
                = Pm + k*(nB * G)nB * (k * G)
                = Pm

I'm in the right way of implementing ECC?

Absolutely not, and you're not even going in the right way to understand ECC.
ECC doesn't really have an encryption operation the same way that RSA does. There is ElGamal encryption, but because ECC operates on such small order fields, no good encryption scheme is compatible with that. Besides that, it will expand a message of e.g. 10 bytes to 64 bytes - and that's only after taking a very liberal approach to padding the message correctly - something that is required for secure operation. So your image would grow by a factor 6.4 if you would use direct ECC encryption.
As James mentioned, there is something called ECIES which basically derives a symmetric key using DH, sending the local public key with the message, then destroying the temporary private key. The receiver can then derive the same symmetric key using his private key and the public key. This message specific derived key can then be used to encrypt / decrypt the message (i.e. pixel data), e.g.. using AES-CTR which doesn't have any overhead (other than the IV, but as you have a randomized data key, you can use a static IV/nonce of e.g. all zeros).
Unfortunately that will still leave you with the public key to store next to the message.

I was trying to collect benchmarks for group operation and exponentiation of points on NIST P-256 elliptic curve. When I tried to perform a group operation on 2 points on the curve, it takes roughly 2 micro seconds. When I tried to perform exponentiation on a point in elliptic curve with a random exponent, it takes only 3 micro seconds. How is this even possible? Since I am exponentiating with a 256 bit value, this should at least take time required for 256 group operations, which is more than 0.5ms. I am worried if my code is wrong!

for(auto &i : one) i = 0;
one[31] = 1;
curve25519_mul_g(result, one);

In the code, I multiplied 1 with the base point. The base point's x-coordinate is 9, so I would expect the result to be 9.
But instead, it gives me this number:
0xfd3384e132ad02a56c78f45547ee40038dc79002b90d29ed90e08eee762ae715.
Why does this code not generate 9?
","Curve25519 clamps some bits of the scalar to 1 or 0. Specifically in Curve25519 scalar multiplication:

the lowest 3 bits are set to 0, to ensure the output point is only in the large subgroup, and
the highest bit (2^254) is set to one, to make sure the implementer does not skip any Montgomery-ladder steps.

After this clamping operation, the scalar multiplication algorithm will be executed. So in Curve25519, a point cannot be multiplied with 1.

In your case, however, there is even more going on. The nettle uses a little-endian convention in their code. That is, when you execute
one[31] = 1;

you are actually setting the 2^248 bit to one, not the 2^0 bit. Then the clamped value will become k = 2^254 + 2^248.
The computation [2^254 + 2^248] * (9 : 1) results in 0x15e72a76ee8ee090ed290db90290c78d0340ee4755f4786ca502ad32e18433fd (big endian), which corresponds with your observation.

So for the first iteration (i = 0), the remainder just gets set as the initial asc value. The second iteration (i = 1), the calculation is something like rem = (rem * ascVal)%N, where rem in rem * ascVal is the rem (remainder) from the previous iteration. 
This continues until i = e where the last value of rem is returned.
This is what i have so far:


function newVal(ascVal) {

    var rem = ascVal;
    while (i < e) {
        rem = (rem * ascVal) % N;

The thing is it always returns 55 if the input is a single value every time.
All i need it to do is find the remainder after e iterations. Any help would be great and i can post the entire script if needed (includes all calculations etc.)
